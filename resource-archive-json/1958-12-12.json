The Government agreed  with\r\n\r\nthis   recommendation   and,  therefore,   deferred\r\n\r\nconsideration until the future of Radio Malaya  had\r\n\r\nbeen  settled through the negotiations  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taking  place with the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the exact terms of the financial\r\n\r\nsettlement  consequent  on  the  operation  of  two\r\n\r\nseparate   Broadcasting   Departments   from    the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  next year have not yet been  finally\r\n\r\nsettled with the Federation Government, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be  no  reconsideration  of  the\r\n\r\ndecision  to  break up the Pan-Malayan  department,\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore Government is therefore free  to\r\n\r\nmake  its  own  plans  for the future.

M. Mason -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Mason (Nominated):</b> I rise with a plea\r\n\r\nfor   sanity.   On  3rd  December,  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  informed this House at the  commencement\r\n\r\nof his speech that 1958 has not been a particularly\r\n\r\neasy  year.  Most businessmen will  have  described\r\n\r\n1958  in  considerably stronger and more derogatory\r\n\r\nterms.  The Financial Secretary went on  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe House that the recession in trade in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nwas  being felt in Singapore in the spring of  1958\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  to  use his own words, \"By May,, money  became\r\n\r\ntighter.  Trade  drifted into the doldrums\" - a  true\r\n\r\nenough  picture.  And today there  is  little  real\r\n\r\npromise of any improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore business is still on the sick list, and\r\n\r\nit   is   only  after  a  fairly  long  period   of\r\n\r\nconvalescence  can it be expected to improve.  What\r\n\r\nmedicine  has  the  Hon, the  Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nprescribed  for  the  patient that  he  so  clearly\r\n\r\ndiagnosed  as sick? Nothing less than a steep  rise\r\n\r\nin company tax of 10 per cent - a medicine which will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly send the patient back to his sick  bed,\r\n\r\nif not into the morgue! However, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe must assume that Government have had to agree to\r\n\r\nthis  rather  extraordinary  measure  in  order  to\r\n\r\nassist  our  friends  north of the  Causeway,  who,\r\n\r\nunlike  Singapore,  are faced  with  a  very  large\r\n\r\ndeficit - surely  a  noble  gesture  on   our   part.\r\n\r\nParticularly when one realises that had the Company\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax  in  Singapore remained at 30 per cent and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Company tax been increased  to  40  per\r\n\r\ncent,  we would have seen an immediate reversal  of\r\n\r\nthat  flow  of  industries which have been  leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore for the Federation. How sad the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce and Industry must be to see  such  an\r\n\r\nopportunity wasted. Nevertheless, Sir, the proposed\r\n\r\naction  is  in  accordance with the policy  of  all\r\n\r\nParties in this House, namely, that of co-operation\r\n\r\nwith the Federation, and no doubt it will meet with\r\n\r\nthis House's approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of the proceedings, most hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  no  doubt expected that, apart  from  some\r\n\r\nminor  juggling with tariff duties,  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  would resume his seat. Not at  all.  The\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary went on to  inform  the  House\r\n\r\nthat although the Federation Government cannot  see\r\n\r\nits way to take similar action, this House is to be\r\n\r\nasked  to approve a rise in the rate of income  tax\r\n\r\non   personal   incomes - a  proposal  surely   quite\r\n\r\ncontrary to the agreed policy of co-operation  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government. With your  permission,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  will  quote the Financial Secretary's  own\r\n\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore has no satisfactory future unless she\r\n\r\nis associated in the closest possible way fiscally,\r\n\r\nfinancially and economically with the Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How  then  does  he reconcile his  suggestion  that\r\n\r\nSingapore should take independent action? No  doubt\r\n\r\nin  his  reply the Financial Secretary will  assure\r\n\r\nhon.   Members  that  he  is  confident  that   the\r\n\r\nFederation  will follow our action in  due  course.\r\n\r\nHow   often,   Sir,   have   such   prophets   been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscredited?  If  the  Federation  Government  find\r\n\r\nthat, by having a lower personal income tax - however\r\n\r\nsmall   the  difference  may  be - they  can  attract\r\n\r\nbusiness and businessmen, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  should they throw away such an advantage?  Why\r\n\r\nthen,  when  Singapore  is  struggling,  does   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary seek to handicap us out of  the\r\n\r\nrace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deeply sympathise with the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce   and  Industry  who,  with  his   Pioneer\r\n\r\nIndustries Bill, Control of Manufacture  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nother Bills, is doing all he can to assist industry\r\n\r\nin  this  Colony,  and  now, if  this  motion  goes\r\n\r\nthrough,   will   see  yet  further   reasons   for\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  to  prefer  the  Federation  to   this\r\n\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of this debate, hon. Members may be\r\n\r\ninformed  that the difference is so small  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  not make any difference, that it will not  be\r\n\r\nsufficient inducement for industry to move  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  That,  Sir,  is  not  the  point.  The\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  a Pan-Malayan fiscal  policy  is  at\r\n\r\nstake.  There is an old proverb, \"Great  oaks  from\r\n\r\nlittle  acorns  grow\", and if this  House  approves\r\n\r\nthis  dangerous motion, we may well in  the  future\r\n\r\nfind that a precedent has been established and that\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax in Singapore is always  higher\r\n\r\nthan  that  in the Federation; that is  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as  all business has moved from Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I referred to an understatement\r\n\r\nby the Hon, the Financial Secretary regarding 1958,\r\n\r\nbut surely, Sir, he must claim the privilege of the\r\n\r\ngreatest  understatement of 1958  when  he  blandly\r\n\r\ninformed this House that different rates of tax  on\r\n\r\nindividual   incomes  being   used   in   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories   will  not  cause  any  administrative\r\n\r\ninconvenience or difficulty. I can only think  that\r\n\r\nhe   meant  that  it  would  not  cause   him   any\r\n\r\ninconvenience personally. I do not for  one  moment\r\n\r\nimagine  that  those officers who are charged  with\r\n\r\nthe  collection  of  income tax  will  endorse  his\r\n\r\nopinion.  There are many people whose  incomes  are\r\n\r\nunaffected,  whether they live and  reside  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  or  in  Singapore.  Surely  then  those\r\n\r\npeople  will elect to reside in the Federation.  It\r\n\r\ncould  even  be that this, if I may say,  ludicrous\r\n\r\nsuggestion  might result in loss of  collection  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax  in Singapore, instead of  earning  the\r\n\r\npaltry $5 million which seem to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworrying   the   Financial   Secretary   so   much.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, differences in rates of income tax  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries   so  adjacent  as  the  Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore must lead to further evasions of  payment\r\n\r\nof  income  tax.  No  administrative  difficulties?\r\n\r\nNonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know, of course, what line the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill take on this matter. If their leader shows his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusual honesty in these matters, he will undoubtedly\r\n\r\nattack  this  motion. At the last sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  the  hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  stated\r\n\r\nthat   the  Federation  sets  the  pace.  He  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore, surely maul the suggestion that on  this\r\n\r\noccasion we should set the pace. If he does not,  I\r\n\r\ncan  only  assume  that he is so confident  and  so\r\n\r\ncertain  that  this  motion is dangerous,  so  ill-advised  and so down-right silly that  it  will  be\r\n\r\nworth thousands of votes to his Party next May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is difficult, almost impossible, for\r\n\r\nGovernment  supporters to vote  against  the  Party\r\n\r\nline.   But   I  would  like  to  remind   Members,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those who have recently  crossed  the\r\n\r\nFloor,   of  the  Financial  Secretary's   personal\r\n\r\nopinion. In his speech, these are his very words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In my humble opinion, while an integrated Pan-Malayan economy would be to the incalculable\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  both territories, Singapore  has  no\r\n\r\nsatisfactory future unless she is associated in the\r\n\r\nclosest  possible  way  fiscally,  financially  and\r\n\r\neconomically  with  the  Federation.  All  possible\r\n\r\nefforts must be directed over the next two or three\r\n\r\nyears to achieving this association.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is practically an invitation to vote\r\n\r\nagainst his own proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am Malayan-born. I have worked all my\r\n\r\nworking  life  in this country. This  is  the  last\r\n\r\nspeech I shall make in this Assembly. I have no axe\r\n\r\nto  grind All I say to the Financial Secretary  is:\r\n\r\nlet him practise what he preaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.22 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Financial Secretary has  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech not only referred to the 1959 Estimates, but\r\n\r\nhas also reviewed the Estimates for 1957 and 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the events for which this Government was\r\n\r\nresponsible was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Scheme. Sir, the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  in favour of this Scheme because they thought\r\n\r\nthat,  by this Malayanisation Scheme, quite a  good\r\n\r\namount  of  the  money that has been  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers could be saved; and  secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  local officers who are promoted to fill  those\r\n\r\nvacancies  would be able to work for a lesser  pay,\r\n\r\nand,  as a result, Government would be able to save\r\n\r\nquite  a  large sum of money. But now, this present\r\n\r\nGovernment  has let down the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  have  not  only given an enormous  amount  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney   as   Malayanisation   allowances   to   the\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers, but they have also allowed the\r\n\r\nlocal  senior officers who are filling these  posts\r\n\r\nto  draw  the same amount of pay and allowances  as\r\n\r\nwas drawn by expatriate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Budget, the personal emoluments\r\n\r\nalone come to about $115 million, i.e. 40 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the entire Budget. I shall quote an example  of\r\n\r\nhow    the    Singapore   Government,    by    this\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Scheme, has wasted  a  big  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney.  Sir, I am taking my example from the Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department. An engineer who  is  in  a  very\r\n\r\njunior grade, say, for example, draws $800 a month.\r\n\r\nThe  senior officer, who was supposed to draw, say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$3,000   a  month,  by  taking  advantage  of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Scheme, retires. The next  man  gets\r\n\r\nin;  he retires. And then another man gets in.  But\r\n\r\nall  these  men  who are getting  to  the  top  are\r\n\r\nreceiving  the same amount of pay. If there  is  an\r\n\r\nengineer in a junior post who wants to retire,  let\r\n\r\nhim  retire  when he is in the junior capacity.  By\r\n\r\ntaking advantage of this senior capacity allowance,\r\n\r\nthe  senior officer retires, and when he  does  so,\r\n\r\nthe  junior  man takes his place and  receives  the\r\n\r\nsame  allowance  and  the same  pay.  If  a  junior\r\n\r\nofficer retires when he is drawing $800 or $1,000 a\r\n\r\nmonth,  he  is  supposed to get $30,000  under  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Scheme; but when he moves  up  to  a\r\n\r\nsenior position,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe is not only drawing $3,000 and allowances but is\r\n\r\nalso  getting  the  benefit of  the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nScheme  by  which  he will be able  to  draw  about\r\n\r\n$100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I examine very closely the implications\r\n\r\nof  this Malayanisation Scheme, I personally cannot\r\n\r\nbut  feel  that it was merely a conspiracy  between\r\n\r\ncertain   local  senior  officers  and   expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers conveniently to collect big sums of  money\r\n\r\nat the cost of the Singapore taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is a good case to review the salary\r\n\r\nscale of senior Government officers. With this  end\r\n\r\nin  view, I would ask this Government to set  up  a\r\n\r\nSalary  Commission to review the  salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nsenior  officers  who are drawing,  say,  $500  and\r\n\r\nabove.  Pruning must start from the top and not  at\r\n\r\nthe bottom, which the Government usually does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that recently there was a scheme to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  salaries  of  the lower-paid staff - the  Normal\r\n\r\ntrained teachers, nurses and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I wish to express the hope\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  replaces   the\r\n\r\nGovernor, it will not cost the same amount of money\r\n\r\nwhich  goes  to  meet the expense to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the Governor. Pomp  and  ceremony\r\n\r\nmust  give  way  to  the needs of  the  people  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  afford to imitate  the  colonial\r\n\r\nsystem and the ancient monarchies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that when the present Governor\r\n\r\nvacates his residence, this palatial building could\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  a  museum or as  an  art  gallery  or\r\n\r\nconverted   to   some  educational   or   aesthetic\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to congratulate this\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  introducing  relief  work  for  the\r\n\r\nunemployed. Quite a lot of people in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nwithout  jobs.  But  the $1.5 million  provided  is\r\n\r\nquite  inadequate.  I would request  Government  to\r\n\r\nmake  provision  for  at least  $2  million  or  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  from the money taken from the  highly-paid\r\n\r\nsenior officers in Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.28 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in my opinion, the Budget for 1959 was drafted\r\n\r\nby some very clever men with a view to pulling wool\r\n\r\nover  the eyes of the public. The Budget will  not,\r\n\r\nin fact, improve the standard of living of the man-in-the-street. It provides nothing new in the  form\r\n\r\nof  improving the standard of living of the people.\r\n\r\nWhat  the Government is asking from them is to  pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  income  tax,  pay  more  for  cigarettes  and\r\n\r\nunemployment.  As  a direct result,  Government  is\r\n\r\nforced to increase company tax to meet the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government increases company tax to\r\n\r\nbring  it  at  par  with the Federation,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether    this    will    affect    the     future\r\n\r\nindustrialisation of this country.  We  are  facing\r\n\r\nunemployment, and need more and more industries  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  unemployed. It  is  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  give  all  possible  assistance  to\r\n\r\nindustry,  so  that  people may  be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\ninvest  more in Singapore. There will then be  more\r\n\r\nemployment for our youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has increased the taxes\r\n\r\njust  to  please the Federation. I do not know  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  such  a  heavy  tax  was  imposed   on\r\n\r\ncompanies. I want this House to know that this Bill\r\n\r\nhas a far-reaching effect on the economy and social\r\n\r\nstanding of this country. Let me ask the Government\r\n\r\none  question. Has the Federation at any time shown\r\n\r\na  willingness to co-operate with us, unless  their\r\n\r\ninterests  are involved? I am sure all  will  agree\r\n\r\nwith me that there must be mutual understanding and\r\n\r\nco-operation in all undertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Budget now, let me recall a\r\n\r\nstatement  made by the Hon, the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said that the revenue for the  year  1959\r\n\r\nwill be a record one in post-war years; but he  did\r\n\r\nnot  say  a word about the expenditure which  beats\r\n\r\nall  previous records. In other words, we will have\r\n\r\na  record revenue but with greater expenditure than\r\n\r\nin  previous years. Government has no plan for  any\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure. We have to increase income tax\r\n\r\nand duty on cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature of the Budget is that money is\r\n\r\nbeing provided for all Ministries, although many of\r\n\r\nthem  will  have to undergo clerical changes  after\r\n\r\nthe general elections next year. I am at a loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  as to what will happen to  the  surplus\r\n\r\nmoney  voted for these Ministries when they undergo\r\n\r\nchanges.  We may accumulate this as a gift  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government, which is what the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty did in 1950!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a standstill Budget and, as such, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to go into detail. However,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to point out that this Budget is drawn up with\r\n\r\na  view  to  collecting the maximum from the  rate-payers and to providing them with little amenities,\r\n\r\nwhich  is contrary to democratic principles. May  I\r\n\r\nremind  hon.  Members of the House that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  elected  by  the people to look  after  their\r\n\r\ninterests  and not to repress them in the  name  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  or socialism? Sir, we have to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe  mandate  of the people and we have  to  answer\r\n\r\nthem  very  shortly  when we stand  on  the  public\r\n\r\nplatform again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to unemployment, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint this out to the Minister for Labour. In  page\r\n\r\n1   of   the  Strait's'  Times  of  Thursday,  11th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1958,  the speech  of  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry, Federation - not Singapore - was\r\n\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He disclosed that more than 40 new factories\r\n\r\nwill begin operations in Malaya next year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  shows  how much the Federation Government  is\r\n\r\ndoing  for  the welfare of the people.  Further  to\r\n\r\nthat, Sir, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Closure of even one factory will throw hundreds\r\n\r\nof people out of work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  expressed  concern over the families  of  these\r\n\r\nhundreds of people by saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This means that thousands of human beings will\r\n\r\nsuffer   because  their  families  will   also   be\r\n\r\naffected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that he has at heart the interest not\r\n\r\nonly of the workers who will be unemployed but also\r\n\r\ntheir families. That is very clever of the Minister\r\n\r\nof Commerce and Industry of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the ban on textiles, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich  was imposed by the Federation with  the  co-operation   of   our  Minister  for  Commerce   and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  the  Minister of Commerce and  Industry,\r\n\r\nFederation, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We appreciate this point of view as we realise\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore lives by trade and without  it  she\r\n\r\ndies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That means we are depending on trade. If we have no\r\n\r\ntrade, it means we are finished and the only  thing\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  get  is  a lot  of  grass  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir, the Minister said on 4th  December\r\n\r\nthat at the end of the three-month period, he hoped\r\n\r\nto impose anti-dumping legislation so that it would\r\n\r\nthen  be  possible  for Singapore  to  receive  her\r\n\r\nunrestricted  import of textiles, and  other  goods\r\n\r\nfor that matter, if she so desires. Sir, now is the\r\n\r\ntime  for  the  Hon. the Minister for Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry to consider lifting this ban so that every\r\n\r\none   of  us  can  enjoy  this  Christmas  and  the\r\n\r\napproaching Chinese New Year with cheaper goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.37 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  introducing increases in tax,  the  Hon, the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary said this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing has been done to upset the economy of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The incidence of taxation has  been  in\r\n\r\nstrict  proportion  to  capacity  to  pay  and   no\r\n\r\nhardship  has  been  caused  to  anyone ... It  [the\r\n\r\nGovernment]  has  merely done what was  required  to\r\n\r\nmake income meet expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  find it extremely difficult to agree  with\r\n\r\nhis  remarks. It must be recognised that as far  as\r\n\r\nincome  tax is concerned, the rate is already  very\r\n\r\nhigh,  especially  when compared  with  laces  like\r\n\r\nHongkong  which, after all, in functional activity,\r\n\r\nis  similar  to  that of Singapore. The  individual\r\n\r\nmaximum  rate  at  one time was  the  same  as  the\r\n\r\ncompany rate. It has only been increased last  year\r\n\r\nfrom  30  per cent to 40 per cent, and  now  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed to increase it to 50 per cent. We see,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, that the Government  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nattract  investments  in  industry  by  introducing\r\n\r\nmeasures such as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPioneer  Industries (Relief from Income  Tax)  Bill\r\n\r\nand  the  Industrial Expansion (Relief from  Income\r\n\r\nTax)  Bill - not  that we believe anything  big  will\r\n\r\ncome  out  of it - but nevertheless it is  the  right\r\n\r\nthing  to  do  and  even  the  Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary is hoping for a good atmosphere to  raise\r\n\r\nloans  because  increasing  development  cannot  be\r\n\r\nentirely   financed  out  of  revenue  or  reserves\r\n\r\nhereafter; but almost in the same breath, it  seems\r\n\r\nto nullify its own aims and hopes by proposing this\r\n\r\ncrushing increase in income tax. Industry is a long-term  venture. The Hon. the Minister  for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry had often deprecated that people here\r\n\r\nwere  only  interested in short-term turnovers  and\r\n\r\nwas  always  urging people to look ahead.  Even  if\r\n\r\nthere are bold people who could be attracted by the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  measures of tax relief to  invest  in\r\n\r\nindustries,  none  could be  so  optimistic  as  to\r\n\r\nexpect any worthwhile return during the first  five\r\n\r\nyears allowed for relief; but when they look beyond\r\n\r\nthese  five years to find not only a high  rate  of\r\n\r\ntax  but  a frame of mind on the part of  those  in\r\n\r\nauthority   that  rigidly  justifies   this   heavy\r\n\r\nincidence with such lighthearted remarks  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has merely done what is required to make\r\n\r\nincome  meet  expenditure,  then  even  those  bold\r\n\r\npeople  will  surely have no need  to  think  twice\r\n\r\nbefore  they  discover that there is, in  fact,  no\r\n\r\nattraction at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not without competition. Every\r\n\r\ncountry  in  this  region, not excluding  Australia\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Hon. the  Minister  for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  has  included  in  his  list  of  capital\r\n\r\nexporting countries - all these countries are craving\r\n\r\nfor  investments, and the attractions  in  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  places  are better than ours.  How  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expect any investors  to  come  forward\r\n\r\nwhen  they are even now taking steps to deter them?\r\n\r\nIndividual  taxpayers, and this  category  includes\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  both proprietary and  in  partnership,\r\n\r\nneed  as  much  as  companies  to  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nreserves from earnings in order to expand  or  even\r\n\r\nto  maintain their business, because they  have  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  extend  credits  and  other   capital\r\n\r\nformation if they are to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhandle  the  same volume of business from  year  to\r\n\r\nyear.  If they are taxed too high, they are  unable\r\n\r\nto  do  so  and the potential from which we  derive\r\n\r\nthis  tax  is  gradually  weakened.  Even  with   a\r\n\r\nbusiness which can maintain its profits, one effect\r\n\r\nof  this increase will be to deprive or to decrease\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  employee gets as bonus,  or  as  any\r\n\r\nother form of reward at the close of the year,  and\r\n\r\nbusiness generally will not be able to pay the same\r\n\r\ndividends.  Sir,  I  personally  know  of  two  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses  which have been trying to overcome  the\r\n\r\nbad    times   they   were   encountering   by    a\r\n\r\nreorganisation. The announcement of  this  increase\r\n\r\nhas  decided  them  to fold up altogether  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, a lot of people are out of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is a clear indication that a heavy tax\r\n\r\nkills  enterprise. Who would be willing to risk - and\r\n\r\nall enterprises are risks - when he realises that  on\r\n\r\na 50/50 chance if he loses, he loses a whole dollar\r\n\r\nof  his  capital,  and when he makes,  he  is  only\r\n\r\nallowed  to retain 50 cents? There are, of  course,\r\n\r\nthose who would, because they have to do something,\r\n\r\nbut then there is this added incentive for them  to\r\n\r\nevade.  The  estimate for collection of income  tax\r\n\r\nfor  1959  shows  a decrease of $10  million  which\r\n\r\nGovernment  fully knows is due to reduced  earnings\r\n\r\nof some companies during the last 12 months, and it\r\n\r\nshows  that  reduced earnings must now be  punished\r\n\r\nwith  a  higher rate. The most curious thing  about\r\n\r\nthis  is  why  individual tax which had  only  been\r\n\r\nincreased last year by 10 per cent should again  be\r\n\r\nincreased  by  another 10 per cent  this  year.  In\r\n\r\nspite  of  the Government's protestations  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  agree  with the Federation in  all  things,\r\n\r\nincluding  monetary, fiscal and economic  policies,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  we find it necessary to disagree  with\r\n\r\nthe Federation in this respect of tax policy? Is it\r\n\r\nmerely  on  the grounds that it will not cause  any\r\n\r\nadministrative  inconvenience and difficulties?  My\r\n\r\nhon, friend here has been more eloquent than I  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect, but I think the civil  servant,  for\r\n\r\none, will wish that he were in the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nno doubt others too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deficit budgetted for - $21 million - represents\r\n\r\nonly an item of development;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$20  million having to be  transferred  from\r\n\r\nrevenue to Development Fund. The Hon, the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary   has   said   that   future   increasing\r\n\r\ndevelopment cannot be totally financed from revenue\r\n\r\nand must be financed largely from loans. There are,\r\n\r\nof  course,  mounting expenditures  on  the  social\r\n\r\nservices,  particularly  education,  which  it   is\r\n\r\nestimated will increase by $10 million every  year;\r\n\r\nand  there are the personal emoluments which is $10\r\n\r\nmillion  over  1958.  Can  these  be  financed   by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  rate of income tax  from  year  to\r\n\r\nyear? For instance, the increase of 10 per cent  in\r\n\r\ncompany  tax  yields $10 million which approximates\r\n\r\nthe  increase  of  $10 million for education  every\r\n\r\nyear.  Next  year we raise another 10 per  cent  in\r\n\r\ncompany  tax.  This will be eaten up  by  education\r\n\r\nalone and so on until we tax the companies 100  per\r\n\r\ncent.  What then? Will it catch up with  the  ever-\r\n\r\nincreasing  expenditure?  It  is  clear  that   the\r\n\r\npattern  of  taxation to which the  population  has\r\n\r\nbeen accustomed has been exhausted. If the goose is\r\n\r\nnot  to be further weakened, ways must be found  to\r\n\r\ncurb this increasing expenditure and new avenues of\r\n\r\nrevenue  must be sought. Why always pick on  income\r\n\r\ntax?  I  am wondering what is wrong with the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare lottery and the tax on bookmakers which has\r\n\r\nso often been mooted. These will surely bring in at\r\n\r\nleast  $10  million with no hardship to anyone.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are any objections, whether on moral grounds\r\n\r\nor  on  whatever grounds, then what is being  done,\r\n\r\nand is it possible to eliminate these activities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tax the businessmen seems to be the easiest\r\n\r\nway  out  for Government, because the businessmen's\r\n\r\nvoice is feeble. But care must be taken to see that\r\n\r\nthis  section must not be unduly weakened,  because\r\n\r\nit  is this section which will at all times provide\r\n\r\nfor our upkeep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary has said that\r\n\r\n\"the  new Government will be considerably exercised\r\n\r\nto  find  means  of taxation which will  not  weigh\r\n\r\npenally on any particular section of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  community or business interests in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  not harm the economy . . .\"  Strangely\r\n\r\nenough, I suggest it is doing just that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.52 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nafter  hearing  the warning by the hon.  Mr  Mason\r\n\r\nthat  those  who  have  crossed  the  Floor  should\r\n\r\nconsider  very  carefully  before  supporting  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  I feel that I must in duty bound  give  my\r\n\r\npersonal opinion of what I think of the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike previous Budgets which had so many items\r\n\r\nfor  Members to pick on, this year's Budget has one\r\n\r\nvery important item to which several Members before\r\n\r\nme  have  referred,  and that is  the  increase  of\r\n\r\nincome tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mason also commented that it might not be possible for Members of the Opposition Benches who\r\n\r\nhave crossed the Floor to vote against this motion,\r\n\r\nbut I think there is nothing to prevent any of such\r\n\r\nMembers  to  give their personal opinion  which,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,   is   in  accordance  with  parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly agree with Mr Mason that the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  income  tax - either  company  tax   or\r\n\r\nindividual  tax - will  certainly  drive   not   only\r\n\r\nindustries  but  also personnel to the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Government, prior to the introduction of  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget,  said  that it would produce  a  standstill\r\n\r\nBudget, but it is rather surprising and alarming to\r\n\r\nfind  now  that it has thought fit to introduce  an\r\n\r\nincreased tax on income and an increase in duty  on\r\n\r\nsmokes.  Most  of the industries in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\ngoing  over  to  the Federation, and  I  understand\r\n\r\nquite a lot more will follow suit very soon.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of the increase in tax on personal income, I\r\n\r\nam  quite sure that our top officers, good officers\r\n\r\nand  efficient  officers will also be  thinking  of\r\n\r\ngoing  to the Federation, because the tax there  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  heavy  as  what we are going  to  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the use of having self-government if\r\n\r\nwe   do   not  have  industries  here  to   provide\r\n\r\nemployment  and the efficient officers to  run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment?  Certainly it is no use to  have  self-government if there is nothing left in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Government is always trying\r\n\r\nto   introduce   legislation  in  line   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. But in this case it  has  not\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  Federation. I am told  that  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation there is no increase of such income tax.\r\n\r\nWhy  then should we have an increase in income  tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere? I wonder whether the Financial Secretary  has\r\n\r\nconsulted the Federation regarding this increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Financial Secretary in his speech has\r\n\r\nsaid  that the increase in income tax is very small\r\n\r\nand  that,  in his personal opinion,  it  will  not\r\n\r\naffect the ordinary man. But I would like to remind\r\n\r\nthe  Hon, the Financial Secretary that little drops\r\n\r\nof  water make a mighty ocean. It may be $10  here;\r\n\r\nit  may be $10 there; and then from the $10 it will\r\n\r\ncome  to  $100; and that $100 will come to  $1,000.\r\n\r\nCan  an  ordinary  man afford to  sacrifice  a  few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndollars here and a few dollars there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind the Financial Secretary that\r\n\r\nwhen  the duty on smokes was increased, a Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Assembly. I opposed it. At  that\r\n\r\ntime it may have been a matter of five cents. Today\r\n\r\nwe are going to have to pay another five cents more\r\n\r\nper  packet. A man who smokes three packets  a  day\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  find an extra 15 cents  a  day - that\r\n\r\nmakes it $4.50 a month. The Financial Secretary did\r\n\r\nnot  agree with me that when the tax on smokes  was\r\n\r\nincreased  it would not affect those who  smoke.  I\r\n\r\nwill  read an extract from his speech made when  he\r\n\r\nintroduced the Budget:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Collections of customs duties have certainly\r\n\r\nfallen  below the estimate, particularly in respect\r\n\r\nof liquors and petrol.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I warn the Financial Secretary that any increase in\r\n\r\ntax  will  certainly affect the income, or revenue,\r\n\r\nbecause  if there is an increase it will  certainly\r\n\r\naffect consumption which will be decreased. For the\r\n\r\nsalaried  man,  his salary will  remain  the  same.\r\n\r\nThere   is   no   increase.  In   some   Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartments  there  may be  a  yearly  increase  in\r\n\r\nsalary, but that increase is very small. If that is\r\n\r\na fact, where can he find extra money to meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  budget? In the case of the Government, it  can\r\n\r\nof  course  introduce  tax increases  to  meet  its\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote another extract from the Financial Secretary's Budget speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It would be dangerous to allow our reserves to\r\n\r\nbe  run  down too far. We must safeguard  ourselves\r\n\r\nagainst  the  financial consequences  of  a  severe\r\n\r\nrecession  in  trade:  we  must  retain  enough  to\r\n\r\nfinance  public works as a measure of  unemployment\r\n\r\nrelief in time of depression;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now the Government can find money by an increase in\r\n\r\ntax  to  meet  all these things. But where  can  an\r\n\r\nordinary  man find this money? So the only  sources\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  find this money are  either  to  beg,\r\n\r\nborrow  or  steal. If he borrows  money,  he  finds\r\n\r\nhimself  in the soup. If he is a civil servant  and\r\n\r\nhe gets himself in debt and he does not declare it,\r\n\r\nhe  is  subject  to dismissal from the  service.  A\r\n\r\nstory  appeared in the Singapore Standard yesterday\r\n\r\nof a man - a father of seven - who was sacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\"Father of 7 Gets A Shock </div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Sack For Govt. Clerk Who</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Got Into Debt\"</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this  poor  man has seven children  and  just\r\n\r\nbecause he could not balance his budget, he had  to\r\n\r\nborrow.  As a result of this, he now finds  himself\r\n\r\nout  of employment. That makes the situation worse.\r\n\r\nNow where are his seven children going to get their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfood?  If  this man did not borrow, then  the  next\r\n\r\nalternative  would  be for him to  rob.  What  else\r\n\r\ncould he do but rob? Is it right to rob, Sir? If  a\r\n\r\nman  robs, he will find himself behind bars. It  is\r\n\r\nnot that he should rob; it may be that, because  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances, he has got to rob. My view  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  by introducing this  increase  in\r\n\r\ntax,  is  trying  to  encourage  people  to  commit\r\n\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if a man does not want to borrow or to rob,\r\n\r\nthen the last alternative is to seek corruption. We\r\n\r\nwant an efficient public service here. We certainly\r\n\r\ndo not want to encourage corruption. Summing up, if\r\n\r\na  man  wants to find money to balance his  budget,\r\n\r\nthree  sources are open to him - either borrow, steal\r\n\r\nor  seek corruption. Sir, in this matter I am  just\r\n\r\nexpressing my personal opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  may  not be the Government policy, but  as  a\r\n\r\nBack-bencher I feel that I have a right to  express\r\n\r\nmy  personal opinion. But I should like to say that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is very courageous in  introducing\r\n\r\nthis  increase  in tax on the eve  of  the  general\r\n\r\nelections.  I  must congratulate the Government  on\r\n\r\nits courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for  those who have had to be afflicted  with\r\n\r\nall  the  curious political theories of how finance\r\n\r\nshould be managed, let me congratulate the Hon, the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary firstly, for having presented a\r\n\r\nBudget  which is in accordance with all  the  other\r\n\r\nprevious  Budgets in principle, and secondly,  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  wind up the four years  of  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution  with a much reduced  special  reserve\r\n\r\nfund   than  when  this  Government  first  assumed\r\n\r\noffice. We are not really interested in what is  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget, and what is out of the Budget, because\r\n\r\neverybody  knows  that this is a Budget  for  about\r\n\r\nfour months, or five months at the outside. But for\r\n\r\nthe  assurance  that there would be election  writs\r\n\r\nbefore  the  end of this Assembly,  we  would  have\r\n\r\nmoved  that  this  Budget be  drawn  up  for  three\r\n\r\nmonths' expenses only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from a special reserve fund of over $100\r\n\r\nmillion  when  the Labour Front Government  assumed\r\n\r\noffice  in  1955,  it  has now  gone  down,  or  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  go  down,  to  $65  million - this   is\r\n\r\naccording  to the speech of the Hon, the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary - including  $20  million   for   Christmas\r\n\r\nIsland.  It  means  that the  Government  has  been\r\n\r\nspending from reserves and is leaving us with  much\r\n\r\nless  money to spare than when they first began.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know whether this is a Labour Front Budget\r\n\r\nor  a  Singapore People's Alliance's Budget.  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that  the S.P.A. has not even been officially\r\n\r\nformed  and  has  not even been gazetted  as  being\r\n\r\nexempted  from  registration  under  the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Presumably it is still a  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nBudget,  and therefore it will absolve  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown,  who has Just joined  the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nfrom the embarrassment of having to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are surprised that the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  should have had the audacity to  say  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  that they can quite safely  put  up\r\n\r\ncompany tax to 40 per cent. He was the same man who\r\n\r\ntold  us  last year that there should be  a  safety\r\n\r\nmargin  of at least ten, if not more, per cent.  We\r\n\r\nwere  the  first to advocate that they  should  tax\r\n\r\ncompanies  up  to  the hilt, according  to  British\r\n\r\nstandards,  because most of them in  any  case  are\r\n\r\nregistered  in  Britain or the investors  are  from\r\n\r\nBritain. They can easily go up to 9s, in the  pound\r\n\r\nwithout affecting anybody's pocket other than  that\r\n\r\nof  the British Treasury. But to do this at a  time\r\n\r\nof slump, having missed all the millions of dollars\r\n\r\nthat could have been collected as extra revenue  in\r\n\r\nthe last three years, is the height of idiocy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the income tax, may I say this? It really\r\n\r\ndepends upon how much the difference is. For people\r\n\r\nlike  the hon. Mr Mason and his friends,  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  large  holdings  in the Federation  and  some\r\n\r\nholdings  in  Singapore, it might  be  worth  their\r\n\r\nwhile to reside in Johore Bahru and get a fast  and\r\n\r\ncomfortable  car to travel down to Singapore.  Then\r\n\r\nthey   pay  Singapore  income  tax  only  on  their\r\n\r\nSingapore investments and businesses and Federation\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on  their Federation  investments  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  Quite  frankly,  we  would  not   have\r\n\r\nstarted  this  if we were confronted  with  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation, but the Labour Front has got  a  lunatic\r\n\r\nfringe  about  it which sometimes is quite  useful.\r\n\r\nThey  are prepared in their last desperate  moments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  strike  out in all directions. I  say  if  this\r\n\r\nworks  successfully  and  the  $5  million  can  be\r\n\r\ncollected without a change in residence of all  the\r\n\r\nwealthy  men  who have businesses in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, then why not? If it cannot  be  so\r\n\r\ncollected without adverse results, then no doubt  a\r\n\r\nfuture  government will put matters right.  But  we\r\n\r\ncertainly  will  not  take  serious  objections  to\r\n\r\ncollecting an extra $5 million provided it  can  be\r\n\r\nso  collected. We have to take the word of the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Secretary that it can  be  collected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpeditiously and efficiently and that in any  case\r\n\r\nwe are quite sure to get $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to make some reference to the way\r\n\r\nin  which  the  Hon, the Financial  Secretary  has\r\n\r\nglossed  over  certain things.  For  instance,  his\r\n\r\nexplanation  of the savings on personal emoluments.\r\n\r\nHe  says that in 1959 it is expected that a sum  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$114.9   million   would  be  spent   on   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments as compared with $123 million  in  1958.\r\n\r\nSir, this is an astonishing proposition because  he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoes  on to admit that he does not think that  next\r\n\r\nyear  actual  expenditure will fall short  of  $114\r\n\r\nmillion.  Earlier when he dealt with what  was  the\r\n\r\nactual expenditure on personal emoluments for 1958,\r\n\r\nit was not $123 million but it was $104 million. On\r\n\r\npage  3  of the stencilled document which he handed\r\n\r\nin,  he  said  that  expenditure  was  to  be  $104\r\n\r\nmillion.  In other words, there is going to  be  an\r\n\r\nactual estimated increase in personal emoluments of\r\n\r\n$10 million, and it is completely dishonest to lead\r\n\r\nus to believe -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, this is a\r\n\r\nstandstill Budget and we have very little  to  say.\r\n\r\nIf  and  when  the time comes for a review  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  situation in 1959,  we  can  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  there are many items in the  Estimates\r\n\r\nwhich will disappear or be radically pruned,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough we are not suggesting for one moment  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  follow  the footsteps of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  (Mr A. R. Lazarous). I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhich  P.W.D. engineer has stepped on his  toes  or\r\n\r\nwho  has  been very strict over his contracts  with\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D.  I fully sympathise with  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsentiments which he has expressed, but I would  ask\r\n\r\nhim  when  he speaks on these matters to  remember:\r\n\r\n(1)  that we have got to be factually accurate; and\r\n\r\n(2)  that  when  we  hit out at  the  local  senior\r\n\r\nofficers, we must make sure that we are hitting out\r\n\r\nat the right persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not the persons who agreed to\r\n\r\nMalayanisation terms. The Malayanisation terms were\r\n\r\nagreed  to  between a group of expatriate  officers\r\n\r\nand a group of elected Ministers in the Federation,\r\n\r\nand  what  the Hon, the Chief Minister of Singapore\r\n\r\ndid  was  to hide behind the sarong of the Minister\r\n\r\nin  the Federation. That is why we are saddled with\r\n\r\nthe  Malayanisation terms. But that is all past and\r\n\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to prune the salaries of our professional\r\n\r\nofficers and our Division I officers, but there are\r\n\r\ncertain  limitations  which we  must  observe.  The\r\n\r\nfirst   point   is  that - according   to   the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution - their basic salaries, as distinct from\r\n\r\ntheir  allowances which amount to 30 odd  per  cent\r\n\r\nover  and  above  the  basic  salaries,  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntouched. The second point is that there are  limits\r\n\r\nin  the realities of the situation; that unless one\r\n\r\ncan  pay  a  reasonable remuneration for skill  and\r\n\r\ntalent  in  competition with  what  the  commercial\r\n\r\nworld  can  offer,  then  of  course  we  may  find\r\n\r\nourselves   landed   with   highly   unsatisfactory\r\n\r\ninstruments  of  policy.  But  even  within   those\r\n\r\nlimitations,  I would like to say that  the  senior\r\n\r\nGovernment officers should disabuse their minds  of\r\n\r\nany  illusions that they can, in the  tradition  of\r\n\r\nthe  M.C.S., do the minimum amount of work for  the\r\n\r\nmaximum amount of pay, and with the maximum  amount\r\n\r\nof  retirement  benefits. We expect from  them  the\r\n\r\nmaximum amount of effort for the minimum amount  of\r\n\r\nreturns we offer. What was been given them will not\r\n\r\nbe  taken back and will be honoured by a subsequent\r\n\r\nGovernment, but we expect them to do their duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some curious items in the\r\n\r\nEstimates which we shall touch on in greater detail\r\n\r\nwhen we come to the Committee of Supply; but it  is\r\n\r\ntypical  of the four Budgets that have gone through\r\n\r\nthat  no  imagination whatsoever has been shown  to\r\n\r\nthe  realities of our situation. $727,040 is  being\r\n\r\nspent on the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows that the Malayan Navy was  not  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  use  to  Singapore and,  quite  rightly,  was\r\n\r\nhanded over to the Federation of Malaya. Why should\r\n\r\nwe spend over $700,000 a year for the entertainment\r\n\r\nof  a  few  people  who like to inspect  people  in\r\n\r\nsailors' uniforms on H.M.S. Laburnum in Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\nBasin?  I  do  not understand it. I  am  told  that\r\n\r\nH.M.S.  Laburnum  is  not renowned  for  its  naval\r\n\r\nexercises,  but for the piddling and tippling  that\r\n\r\ngoes on on board at all hours of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also $573,230 for the Malayan Auxiliary\r\n\r\nAir  Force,  half of which is for payments  to  the\r\n\r\nR.A.F. for services. Nobody believes that  we  are\r\n\r\ntraining  local  pilots. I do not  know  what  this\r\n\r\nmoney  is being spent for, who is burning  up  high\r\n\r\noctane  fuel and paying the R.A.F. for the  use  of\r\n\r\nits  services, and we see no reason why that should\r\n\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sum of $546,200 for civil defence.\r\n\r\nNobody is suggesting that this sum is going to help\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  if an 8,000-mile missile, with ten megatons  of\r\n\r\nexplosives  in  its  warhead,  were  to  arrive  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  from  somewhere  north  of  the   Arctic\r\n\r\nCircle.   It  is  time  to  reappraise  all   these\r\n\r\nunnecessary expenditures. However, I do not  expect\r\n\r\nthe   Ministers,  despite  all  their  agility   in\r\n\r\nchanging  names  and colours,  have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nmaster  the intricacies of finance and the  Budget.\r\n\r\nThey  have  left  it  entirely  to  the  Hon, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial   Secretary.  I  will   give   him   this\r\n\r\ncredit - that at least he has not, on the eve of  the\r\n\r\nwinding  up  of the officio cum elected  Government\r\n\r\nunder  the  Rendel Constitution,  left  it  with  a\r\n\r\ndeficit as wide as the one which the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has left for the year 1959. If  that  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  then I think we have to be grateful for these\r\n\r\nsmall mercies. We know that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserves have gone down, but we know that at  least\r\n\r\nsome  effort  is being made not to  let  the  whole\r\n\r\nwealth of this little island drain out to sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would warn the elected Ministers that with\r\n\r\nthree  months  to go, there should be no  monkeying\r\n\r\nabout with the Budget. When a vote of $320,000  was\r\n\r\ngiven   for  rural  development,  nobody  mentioned\r\n\r\nanything   about  using  it  for  the   relief   of\r\n\r\nunemployed persons. Then as the election looms over\r\n\r\nthe  horizon,  the $320,000, instead of  going  for\r\n\r\nrural   development,  is  used   for   unemployment\r\n\r\nrelief - $3  per  day  to a few  unemployed  persons,\r\n\r\npresumably  to build roads in the rural area.  That\r\n\r\nis not the way to budget. We are asked to approve a\r\n\r\nwhole  year's  Budget  by a  Government  which  has\r\n\r\npromised to go out of office by 2nd April, 1959. We\r\n\r\nwould ask it, in the few months left to it, not  to\r\n\r\ndepart  from  what  each  sum  of  money  has  been\r\n\r\nspecifically earmarked for. And it is the  duty  of\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Secretary and Director of  Audit  to\r\n\r\nsee that that is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the last Budget by an\r\n\r\nofficial.  We hope that the next Budget  will  show\r\n\r\nmore  imagination than the four years of the Labour\r\n\r\nFront-UMNO-MCA, (now SPA), Coalition Government has\r\n\r\nbeen able to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.16 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary has suggested that this  is  a\r\n\r\ncourageous Budget in as much as the Government  has\r\n\r\nresisted  the  temptation to tie the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nincoming government in regard to the policies  that\r\n\r\nit  may  wish  to adopt after the coming  election.\r\n\r\nThat  is not quite the way it strikes us. Where  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  give  credit is in the fact that at long  last\r\n\r\nThe  Government has taken heed of our  advice  over\r\n\r\nthe   years   and  made  some  attempt  to   reduce\r\n\r\nexpenditure; to be precise, from an estimated $277-million this year to $268.5-million next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not judge Budgets simply by the figures\r\n\r\nthat  are  presented to us. We judge them  by  the\r\n\r\naccomplishments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the past year or years, and by the intentions of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the future. Whatever the  merits\r\n\r\nor  demerits of the actual estimates, this  is  the\r\n\r\nBudget of a tired government, lacking in confidence\r\n\r\nin  itself,  unwilling or unable to  plan  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture, because manifestly it has no plans  and  no\r\n\r\nhopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that has astonished us is that\r\n\r\nthe new Alliance, when it was formed, announced  no\r\n\r\nprogramme,  no plans, and no policies.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  frame a Budget if you have no  policy.\r\n\r\nHere  is  a time - if ever there was one - if you  have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  yourself and in the future,  for  a\r\n\r\nnewly constituted Alliance to frame and proclaim an\r\n\r\nimaginative, challenging, election-winning  Budget,\r\n\r\nsomething calculated to rally all democratic forces\r\n\r\nto its side. But instead, we are given a standstill\r\n\r\nBudget in a world that is moving fast, because  the\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Front Bench opposite are too  tired\r\n\r\nand too stale to do anything but stand still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn at this stage, Sir, to company tax\r\n\r\nand  examine it now, on the Second Reading,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  later,  we would say this: that  in  view  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial position at present, it seems\r\n\r\nthat  we must accept as inevitable the increase  in\r\n\r\ncompany tax proposed. But we must not overlook  the\r\n\r\nfact  that this increase will not help to create  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  climate for the expansion  of  industry\r\n\r\nand  the  launching  of new enterprises  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  professes  to wish  to  encourage.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  expect industrialists and investors  to  be\r\n\r\nanything  but  hard-headed in these matters.  Long-term  investments require a long view ahead.  While\r\n\r\nit  is  true  that  the  new  legislation  allowing\r\n\r\nremission  of  taxation - the pioneer industries  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion schemes - is a step forward,  a\r\n\r\n33 1/8 per cent increase in company tax, in the same\r\n\r\nbreath  so to speak, is a step back again.  Let  us\r\n\r\nnow  have  a look at income tax revenue during  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  period of office. In 1956  the  yield\r\n\r\nwas  $68.3-million;  in 1957  it  dropped  to  $65-million;  in  1958 it will have been maintained  at\r\n\r\napproximately the same figure of $65-million, as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of an increase in the rate of personal  tax\r\n\r\nfrom 30 to 40 per cent. At\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same  rate  of  tax, the  Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nestimates  the yield of tax in 1959 at $55-million.\r\n\r\nHe therefore proposes to increase company tax by 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  regain  this $65-million  mark,  and\r\n\r\npersonal tax by 10 per cent to bring the figure  to\r\n\r\njust  over  $70.million. We now have a  picture  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening. Since 1956,  the  Government's\r\n\r\nfirst  full  year in office, we are increasing  the\r\n\r\nyield  from income tax by roughly $2-million,  that\r\n\r\nis  to say, from $68.3-million in 1956 to just over\r\n\r\n$70-million in 1959 through the drastic measure  of\r\n\r\nraising  personal tax from 30 to 50  per  cent  and\r\n\r\ncompany  tax  from  30 to 40 per  cent - an  eloquent\r\n\r\ntestimony  of our declining prosperity  during  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's term of office. As I said  last  year,\r\n\r\nit is only too clearly revealed that Government has\r\n\r\nfailed  to expand commerce and industry during  the\r\n\r\npast three years, for if commerce and industry  had\r\n\r\nexpanded,  it would be reflected in the income  tax\r\n\r\nyield.  It follows, therefore, that as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  decreased spending power that must come  about\r\n\r\nin  1959 through increased taxation, the income tax\r\n\r\nyield  will again drop back to something like  $55-million or $60-million in 1960. Increase in the tax\r\n\r\nrate  one  year has as its corollary the inevitable\r\n\r\nfalling off in yield in the following year, and the\r\n\r\nlaw  of  diminishing returns begins to operate.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be difficult to say where and when the limit\r\n\r\nwill  be reached, but we must be getting very close\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must accept the present increase as\r\n\r\nforced upon us as a necessity, we must give warning\r\n\r\nthat  such a large increase, at a time when we  are\r\n\r\nby  no means out of the recession, is not going  to\r\n\r\nhelp  to produce an expanding economy, more capital\r\n\r\ninvestment  and more employment. It  is  abundantly\r\n\r\nevident,  Sir,  that  the  Government  machine  has\r\n\r\nfailed to tick. Where are the promises of the years\r\n\r\ngone by? Let us have a look at a few of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Ministry of Health, there is the sad story\r\n\r\nof the District Hospital. First, it was to be built\r\n\r\nin  Kallang,  then at Bedok, and now we  understand\r\n\r\nthat it has been scrapped altogether and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland  given  back to the owners. Total  achievement\r\n\r\nafter   three   and   a   half  years - no   District\r\n\r\nHospital - except  that we believe that  the  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  Hospital  for  the  chronic  sick  is  to  be\r\n\r\nconverted  into  one - and we know  what  conversions\r\n\r\ncost.  In  any  case, we end up with one  hospital:\r\n\r\ninstead of two, and that one not even finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the drive against tuberculosis,\r\n\r\nwhich is much more important even than that against\r\n\r\npolio,   although  it  is  less  spectacular,   the\r\n\r\nposition  seems  to  be one of extreme  anxiety.  A\r\n\r\nspecial  Survey has been carried out for which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to be commended. But yet at the  very\r\n\r\ntime   when  more  cases  of  hospitalisation   are\r\n\r\ninevitably being discovered, and will be discovered\r\n\r\nin  the future, the number of beds available at the\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng Hospital is being reduced by turning\r\n\r\na ward into a nurses' hostel - another conversion and\r\n\r\nmore costs - a change of policy and wastage of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nHere we find failure to build secondary schools  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable  proportions to primary  schools - only  9\r\n\r\nagainst 59, or I against 6 approximately - and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  a  desperate scramble to  gain  entry  into\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools,  resulting  in  corruption  and\r\n\r\nleakages  in the all-important examination  papers.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  is worse - many children are getting  into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary schools only at the age of 8 plus. There is\r\n\r\nalso  the disappointment caused by the cutting down\r\n\r\nof  the  cultural affairs allocation,  on  which  I\r\n\r\nshall have more to say later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In commerce and industry, the Minister has had a\r\n\r\nhard  row  to hoe. It was once said of Shelley  the\r\n\r\npoet that he was \"an ineffectual angel beating  his\r\n\r\nluminous  wings in vain\". I would hardly  call  the\r\n\r\nMinister  either angelic or luminous, but otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  description might be applicable. Last  year  I\r\n\r\nbrought  to his attention the Government's  failure\r\n\r\nto  expand  industry,  quoting employment  figures.\r\n\r\nThese  are worth repeating and bringing up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  March  1956 the number of workmen  employed  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufacturing is 57,332; in March 1957,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55,011;  and  March  1958,  51,296.  And   in   all\r\n\r\nindustries  the  figures are (in thousands)  124.6,\r\n\r\n123.2,  and 118 respectively. The trend  is  worse:\r\n\r\nthe   slip  backwards  is  going  faster.  But  the\r\n\r\npopulation  increases each year by an amount  equal\r\n\r\nto the total number employed in manufacturing. That\r\n\r\nis a sobering and depressing thought. Last year the\r\n\r\nMinister  pooh-poohed these figures,  stating  that\r\n\r\nthey  gave a false picture, that these figures were\r\n\r\nthe  returns  of  different  employers,  and  if  a\r\n\r\nreduced  number  of employers sent in  returns,  it\r\n\r\ncould  not be helped. I submit, Sir, that  if  less\r\n\r\nemployers send in returns, it must be because there\r\n\r\nare  less  employers. If it  is  not  so,  let  the\r\n\r\nMinister present the true figures. But the Minister\r\n\r\nwent on to give a glowing picture of the number  of\r\n\r\nindustries  that were about to be set  up,  but  he\r\n\r\ncould not disclose the nature of them. Whether many\r\n\r\nof these mysterious industries have materialised or\r\n\r\nnot,  we  do not know; but what we do know is  that\r\n\r\nthere  are less persons being employed in  industry\r\n\r\ntoday  than  there were a year ago. And  now,  only\r\n\r\nthis month, after years of prompting from this side\r\n\r\nof   the  House - I  will  not  weary  you,  Sir,  by\r\n\r\nrepeating what I said before - the Pioneer Industries\r\n\r\nand the Industrial Expansion Bills have come before\r\n\r\nus, too late to have the impact they might have had\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago.  And  with  what  irony  are  they\r\n\r\nintroduced, hand in hand with the increase of 33 1/3 per cent in company tax!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, we must turn to housing. The Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  pointed out that 9,000 units of  housing\r\n\r\nwill  have  been built during the lifetime  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government up to the end of this year.  But\r\n\r\nlet me remind him that 2,900 of these were built in\r\n\r\n1955,  that is to say, they were planned  and  were\r\n\r\nbeing  constructed  before the  present  Government\r\n\r\ntook  office. In other words, only 2,000  per  year\r\n\r\nhave   been   built  since  then  under  Government\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Let  me further  remind  him  that\r\n\r\nresidential buildings of all kinds, whether by  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T., P.W.D., City Council or private enterprise,\r\n\r\nwere  5,740 in 1955; 4,445 in 1956; 3,351 in  1957;\r\n\r\nand only 2,826 up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  September of this year - a sad story of declining\r\n\r\nachievement.  We  are  now  told  that   Government\r\n\r\nhousing  development  will have  to  decline  still\r\n\r\nfurther for lack of money. But what has happened to\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  to  allow  people  to  buy  their  own\r\n\r\napartments in S.I.T. housing estates, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan enjoy ownership of their own fiats? This system\r\n\r\nhas  been  adopted in many parts of the world.  The\r\n\r\nlegal  difficulties have been overcome. Why has  it\r\n\r\nnot   been   introduced  here,  as  the  Government\r\n\r\npromised?  Is  the scheme lying forgotten  in  some\r\n\r\ndusty drawer in the Minister's desk, when it should\r\n\r\nhave  been  introduced in the  new  Queenstown  and\r\n\r\nKallang housing estates, and the sums required made\r\n\r\navailable  for further construction?  The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas something to answer for here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, let us examine the record of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications and Works. Firstly,  the\r\n\r\ndeferring  of  a  proper  public  transport  system\r\n\r\nregarding  which no progress of any  tangible  kind\r\n\r\nhas  been made in three and a half years.  With  no\r\n\r\nreorganised bus routes, we still find our  children\r\n\r\nhaving   to   go   to   school   expensively    and\r\n\r\nextravagantly in cars and pirate taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the failure to solve the problem of\r\n\r\nfloods,  so  that  now  the main  trunk  road  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  the Federation can be flooded  to  a\r\n\r\ndepth of four feet outside the University of Malaya\r\n\r\nas  a  result of a two-inch thunderstorm. And  what\r\n\r\ncomfort  had the Minister to give to this House  on\r\n\r\nthe 5th November last? I quote, Sir, from col. 913:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...had the tide been higher or had the\r\n\r\nrainstorm gone on longer, the flooding in the areas\r\n\r\naffected  on  Monday would have  been  considerably\r\n\r\nworse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So much for the Minister's theoretical socialism in\r\n\r\nthe fact of hard facts - and wet ones at that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly and lastly, the abandonment, or certainly\r\n\r\nthe  deferment  of  Phase III  of  the  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nAirport  development which deals with the  handling\r\n\r\nof passengers and freight, and in this airborne age\r\n\r\ngives    visitors   to   Singapore   their    first\r\n\r\nimpressions.  It  is  admitted  that  the   present\r\n\r\nterminal building is inadequate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  cope  only inefficiently  with  the\r\n\r\ntraffic which the new aircraft of 1959 will  bring,\r\n\r\nbut we continue to stagnate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder with these dismal failures facing them,\r\n\r\nwith    their   broken   promises   and   shattered\r\n\r\naspirations, the Government is trying to  save  its\r\n\r\nface  by changing its name, and by laying the blame\r\n\r\non  subversive  elements. But if we are  forced  to\r\n\r\napportion  blame, perhaps it would be fair  to  say\r\n\r\nthat the Government has never really recovered from\r\n\r\nthe  ebullience of its first year in office,  under\r\n\r\nanother leader who led it at a galloping pace  down\r\n\r\njungle  paths  from  which  it  was  difficult   to\r\n\r\nextricate  itself.  To  change  the  metaphor:  new\r\n\r\nbrooms  are  apt to sweep too indiscriminately;  in\r\n\r\n1955 in the present Government; and in 1958 in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, so that the crockery goes  into  the\r\n\r\ndustpan as well as the dirt and the rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let us leave the past on one side for\r\n\r\none  moment, and consider the future. The Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  has stated that the cost of  the  social\r\n\r\nservices will continue to rise year after year.  It\r\n\r\nis  abundantly true of education, and perhaps  less\r\n\r\nso of health. I have pointed out a few other things\r\n\r\nwhich  the Ministers of the Government had promised\r\n\r\nto  do  but  had to abandon. But it is  clear  that\r\n\r\nhowever  heavily  taxed we may  be  by  normal  and\r\n\r\npracticable  methods  of taxation,  revenue  cannot\r\n\r\nrise beyond a certain limit. Somewhere between  the\r\n\r\nestimated  $264-million for 1959  and  $300-million\r\n\r\nwould  be a reasonable guess. What then are  we  to\r\n\r\ndo? If there is a limit to increase in revenue,  we\r\n\r\nmust  of  necessity  look for  ways  and  means  of\r\n\r\nreducing expenditure on a permanent basis. We  come\r\n\r\nto  the  conclusion, as we must, that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nadministration on this small island of  220  square\r\n\r\nmiles  is  out of all proportion to the returns  we\r\n\r\nget and to what we can reasonably afford. We cannot\r\n\r\nafford  the  luxuries of the democratic system  but\r\n\r\nonly the essentials; by which I mean that we cannot\r\n\r\nafford    the    cost   of   a   multiplicity    of\r\n\r\nadministration - a  central or  national  government,\r\n\r\nlocal government as represented by the City\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  for one part of the island, and  four  new\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils for the rest of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often refer to Singapore as a City State. Why\r\n\r\ndo  we not run it like a City State under a single,\r\n\r\nstreamlined, rationalised administration?  Most  of\r\n\r\nus  have  been  brought up to  accept  the  British\r\n\r\npattern    of   central   government   and    local\r\n\r\ngovernment - I have certainly been very close  to  it\r\n\r\nmyself - but it is becoming clear that we must recast\r\n\r\nour  thinking and reshape our ideas, and  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage   to  admit  that  it  is  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nsatisfactory on a small island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government scrapped the City and\r\n\r\nIsland   Council  purely  and  simply,  I  suspect,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Rendel Commission  proposed  it,  and\r\n\r\nsubstituted separate City and District Councils  at\r\n\r\nenormous  extra expense. The decision was taken  in\r\n\r\n1955.  The  necessary Ordinances  were  passed  two\r\n\r\nyears  later - in about August 1957 - but still,  after\r\n\r\nanother  one  and  a quarter years,  there  are  no\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils. At one time we stood poised  on\r\n\r\nthe threshold of District Council elections, to  be\r\n\r\nheld  in April of this year, but now they have been\r\n\r\nconveniently forgotten. The Government has not  had\r\n\r\nthe  courage  to  admit them to be administratively\r\n\r\nunwise,  and  yet they hesitate to  put  them  into\r\n\r\noperation.  And is there a loud public outcry  over\r\n\r\nthe  delay?  There is not. The reason I suggest  is\r\n\r\nnot  far to seek. A new head of expenditure in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates, Head 44, District Councils, adds  up  to\r\n\r\n$3\ufffd-million. If we turn to the Explanatory  Notes\r\n\r\non page 476 of the Estimates, we will find what has\r\n\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Rural Board was abolished when the above\r\n\r\nthree  Councils were established\" - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Rural  Board has not been abolished - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"and the staff split up and posted  to the three Districts Council Offices.  As\r\n\r\nthe  then existing Rural Board staff was inadequate\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  resultant needs, the  following  new\r\n\r\nappointments or posts were authorised in 1958 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

A total of 62 new  posts.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  following posts have been  seconded\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Medical and Health and the Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  respectively to come under  the  direct\r\n\r\ncontrol of the District Councils, and there we have\r\n\r\na  list  of,  curiously enough, another  62  posts.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  an  increase in staff and an increase  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecentralization  among  the  technical   officers,\r\n\r\ntending to a loss of efficiency and co-ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, side by side with this, we have the\r\n\r\nRural  Development  Panel set up  under  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, because of the tendency of a lack of  co-ordination - I will ask you to look at  page  466  of\r\n\r\nthe Estimates where you will read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The activities of various Departments and\r\n\r\norganisations concerned with the rural  areas  have\r\n\r\ntended  to  be unco-ordinated in the  past  and  an\r\n\r\nauthority  to plan the development of  these  areas\r\n\r\nand  to  co-ordinate  the activities  of  the  many\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned with rural affairs was  found\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rural Development Panel has therefore been set\r\n\r\nup  consisting  of  Heads of Departments  concerned\r\n\r\nwith   rural   development.

Contradictions leading\r\n\r\nto  duplication, delay, frustration and sheer waste\r\n\r\nof   money!  The  people  of  Singapore   are   the\r\n\r\nsufferers, not the gainers. They pay more in taxes,\r\n\r\nand get more administration but less results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we are not thinking of a return to a\r\n\r\nCity  and  Island  Council. We are  thinking  of  a\r\n\r\ncomplete   rationalisation  of  our  administrative\r\n\r\nsystem  in  the  hands  of a single  democratically\r\n\r\nelected  body.  In the past year we have  seen  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council pulling in the opposite direction  to\r\n\r\nthe Government - something we cannot afford, whatever\r\n\r\nour  views  may be on which is the right direction.\r\n\r\nSoon  we may find the District Councils pulling  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent directions from the City Council and from\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one simple illustration. The boundary\r\n\r\nbetween  the  City and District Councils  for  many\r\n\r\nmiles runs down the middle of roads, Braddell  Road\r\n\r\nfor example. The City Council may want to resurface\r\n\r\nand  widen their half of the road, even to  make  a\r\n\r\ndual  carriage-way, but the District Council, which\r\n\r\nwill be responsible for the other half of the road,\r\n\r\nmay  have  other ideas. So nothing will happen  and\r\n\r\nthe road will deteriorate, and it will cost more to\r\n\r\nput it in order in the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the present and future state of\r\n\r\nour  finances cannot afford what I have called  the\r\n\r\nluxuries  of  the  democratic  system  where   each\r\n\r\nauthority can follow contradictory policies. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  health is administered by both  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  City  Council. The latter  builds  infant\r\n\r\nwelfare  centres, and the former district  clinics,\r\n\r\nand both cable for Professor Sabin's polio vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads are in the hands of the Government, the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, the District Councils and  now  even\r\n\r\nthe   Rural  Development  Panel.

The\r\n\r\nMcNeice Report recommended placing public utilities\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of a corporation or Board.  However,\r\n\r\nour  view was that so long as public utilities  are\r\n\r\nproperly  administered  without  politics  becoming\r\n\r\npredominant, the City Council could safely be  left\r\n\r\nto  run  them and we believed it to have  been  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's view also. That at least should be the\r\n\r\ncase.  Not  only have public utilities  become  the\r\n\r\nplay  of  politics, but engineers  and  technicians\r\n\r\nhave   departed   until  the  efficiency   of   the\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  water undertakings  is  in  grave\r\n\r\ndanger.  We  believe  now  that  a  corporation  is\r\n\r\nessential so that the life-blood of electricity and\r\n\r\nwater can be safeguarded. So we say rationalise our\r\n\r\nadministration and cut out waste, so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nbetter   utilise   the  small  number   of   expert\r\n\r\ntechnicians remaining to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we show to the Federation and to our\r\n\r\nneighbours  and to the world that we  are  bent  on\r\n\r\nputting our administrative house in order, reducing\r\n\r\nour  overheads  and  lowering our  expenditure,  we\r\n\r\nshould attract both the Federation and the world to\r\n\r\nour  door-step.  Indeed, eventual merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation will be easier if we have one  clear-cut\r\n\r\nadministrative body from which certain subjects can\r\n\r\ngo  under  central  control  with  the  minimum  of\r\n\r\nreorganisation.  We  shall  appeal  more   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation if we are a financial asset  and  not  a\r\n\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my next point: merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation is the desire of all Singapore political\r\n\r\nparties, but we believe that the first step  should\r\n\r\nbe  an economic merger rather than a political one.\r\n\r\nIf  we could come closer together economically  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  at ourselves as a single economic unit,  both\r\n\r\ncountries would benefit. It has been suggested that\r\n\r\nif the Federation Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  have  a  say in  the  working  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board, it would be as realistic a\r\n\r\nstep  in the economic field as having a say in  our\r\n\r\ninternal security in the political field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take another example - in the field of\r\n\r\nelectricity. The Federation Government is launching\r\n\r\na   new   hydro-electric  scheme  in  the   Cameron\r\n\r\nHighlands.  This will cost millions,  but  it  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  able to serve areas of central Malaya.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  only  power station  south  of  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  is  in  Malacca. Is there  any  reason  why\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not be responsible for  providing\r\n\r\npower to the south of this? A Singapore Electricity\r\n\r\nBoard  could work closely together with the Central\r\n\r\nElectricity  Board  of  the Federation.  I  believe\r\n\r\nSingapore   already  supplies  Johore  Bahru   with\r\n\r\nelectricity.  Why  cannot this  sort  of  thing  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  on  a  joint planning basis,  to  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit?  In  other words, the greater mingling  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  countries  in port facilities  and  power\r\n\r\nsupplies - to mention only two possibilities - would be\r\n\r\nof immense advantage to both of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever the future holds, we are in fact on\r\n\r\nthe  eve of great events and the next four or  five\r\n\r\nyears may make or mar our destiny. If Singapore  is\r\n\r\nto  be prosperous, then it cannot be the prosperity\r\n\r\nof  the  few:  that  is  not Socialism,  but  plain\r\n\r\ncommonsense. An age of austerity is coming,  and  a\r\n\r\nvery large number of people reaching quite far down\r\n\r\nin  our social strata must be prepared to accept  a\r\n\r\nless  extravagant way of life. We  are  a  shallow,\r\n\r\npleasure-loving community, finding enjoyment in the\r\n\r\nthings  that  money can buy and not in  the  richer\r\n\r\nthings of the intellect and of the spirit. For this\r\n\r\nreason,  I deplore the cutting down of the cultural\r\n\r\naffairs  grant. I do not say that $100,000  can  do\r\n\r\nthe trick any more than $50,000, but any Government\r\n\r\nworth its salt must do all in its power to interest\r\n\r\nthe  population in cultural pursuits and interests.\r\n\r\nThis  part  of  the  world  is  not  only  rich  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbiological, zoological and botanical treasures  but\r\n\r\nin  subjects  of  sociological,  ethonological  and\r\n\r\nlinguistic  study - great avenues  of  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nresearch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaiting to be explored.

The truth is  that  we\r\n\r\nshall have to look for far larger areas of land  on\r\n\r\nwhich  to settle thousands of our citizens  in  the\r\n\r\nnot  too  distant future. Having passed legislation\r\n\r\nfor  a  44- or 48-hour week, we must see  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  learn how to use their leisure to the  best\r\n\r\nadvantage.  Unless we encourage cultural  pursuits,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  have people with sufficient imagination\r\n\r\nand  enthusiasm to solve the problems that face  us\r\n\r\nin  the  future. If you encourage people to  write,\r\n\r\nyou  encourage them to think, and if you  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  take  up  scientific  or  literary   or\r\n\r\nlinguistic studies for their own sake and  not  for\r\n\r\npure  monetary gain, you will encourage  people  to\r\n\r\nthink  on creative lines and hence to try to  solve\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties of modern Malaya.

But Sir, as long as  there\r\n\r\nis  no Pan-Malayan economic policy - and I would like\r\n\r\nto  repeat  it a million times - we are only  wasting\r\n\r\ntime and public money.

Sir, what is the use of this  so-called\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board? What type of industries\r\n\r\ncan  the Director of this Board have confidence in?\r\n\r\nCan  he  say to any industry \"Yes, you go ahead.  I\r\n\r\nwill  subsidise you. I will subsidise your land.

But,\r\n\r\nSir,  if we believe in a merger with the Federation\r\n\r\nwe must have a Pan-Malayan unification of education\r\n\r\npolicy.  But  we do not have! Chinese  schools  and\r\n\r\nMalay  schools are termed vernacular  schools.  Yet\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar championed  the\r\n\r\ncause  of Malay as the lingua franca!

If\r\n\r\nyou have travelled to India, Switzerland or Canada,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not  think you will find  the  genuine\r\n\r\nnational  aspiration in the last two  countries  as\r\n\r\nstrong  as Mr Nehru's. Yet Mr Nehru has  admitted\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no likelihood of making  Hindustani\r\n\r\nthe lingua franca of India in 50 years. And look at\r\n\r\nthe language row that has occurred so many times in\r\n\r\nCeylon  and India! Why should political capital  be\r\n\r\nmade out of the language issue in this country? The\r\n\r\nmain  stumbling block to a merger between Singapore\r\n\r\n:and the Federation is not because' Malaya is to be\r\n\r\nmade  or  not  to  be  made the lingua  franca  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  our  Malay  brothers  from  across   the\r\n\r\nCauseway say, \"I do not want to merge\". Sir, let us\r\n\r\nface  the  facts.  We do not have  a  unified  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  policy and, therefore,  the  people  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be as ignorant as they are now.  Over  80\r\n\r\nschools  have  applied  for  grant-in-aid  but  the\r\n\r\nBudget  shows only 26. And I do not know  how  many\r\n\r\nMalay schools have applied for such aid - I have  not\r\n\r\nyet  checked  the figures. If we sincerely  believe\r\n\r\nthat  Malay  must  be  the lingua  franca  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, how can we prepare such a Budget? There is\r\n\r\nnot   even   a   Malay   secondary   school   being\r\n\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everything is linked with merger. The\r\n\r\nquestion of merger has become a nightmare not  only\r\n\r\nto  politicians - useless and selfish politicians - but\r\n\r\nalso  to  the  ordinary citizens. They are  worried\r\n\r\nabout the word \"merger\". They are afraid: they  are\r\n\r\nexcited;  they do not know what to do!  Sir,  where\r\n\r\nare our political leaders going to lead us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is useless for me to go into detail\r\n\r\nregarding  this \"dead\" Budget as I have termed  it.\r\n\r\n1958  is  a year of instability and insecurity  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough there have been no riots and no industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes,  yet  the  employment situation  and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness recession worsen day by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Financial Secretary has had the\r\n\r\ncourage  to increase company tax and personal  tax,\r\n\r\nyet  he  shows a reasonableness in his  estimate - he\r\n\r\nonly expects $65-million in 1959 as compared to the\r\n\r\nestimate of $68-million in 1958. Why, knowing  that\r\n\r\nnext year business will not be good and it is going\r\n\r\nto collect much less than in the year 1958, has the\r\n\r\nGovernment   increased  the  tax   especially   the\r\n\r\npersonal income tax? The Financial Secretary  said,\r\n\r\n\"All  right, if you earn $4,000, you only  pay  $20\r\n\r\nmore; $7,000, you only pay $60 more.\" Sir, that $20\r\n\r\nor  $60  to  a  wage-earner,  say  a  clerk,  means\r\n\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I will point out one more strange thing - it\r\n\r\nis  the first time that the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  has in his Budget speech failed to criticise\r\n\r\nthe Hon, the Chief Secretary who I think is the one\r\n\r\nwho should come under heavy fire. The crime wave is\r\n\r\nincreasing day by day. In broad daylight, just opposite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  police  station there was  a  cold-blooded\r\n\r\nmurder - two persons were killed. The crime  wave  is\r\n\r\nso high, and yet many responsible leaders including\r\n\r\nthe  great  leader of the people,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar himself, have failed to touch on this\r\n\r\nsubject. I would like to know why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this Budget is a\r\n\r\nP.A.P./colonial Budget. The colonial Government  is\r\n\r\npreparing a smooth way for the P.A.P. to come  into\r\n\r\npower,  by sabotaging the existing governing  Party\r\n\r\nwhich  is  so unpopular, so useless, and  so  high-handed.  And when the P.A.P. comes into power,  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara might receive  orders  from\r\n\r\nMr  Lennox-Boyd  saying,  \"Dissolve  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nbecause  the  state of affairs in Singapore  is  so\r\n\r\nchaotic and because you people do not know  how  to\r\n\r\nrun  your  country.\"  I have heard  this  from  the\r\n\r\npeople many times, \"As soon as the hon.

As you know, he was once my\r\n\r\ncolleague  in the old Council. He has  worked  very\r\n\r\nhard   and   honestly  for  the  benefit   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  My  criticism will  not  be  levelled\r\n\r\nagainst him personally, but against the Council of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters.  He  is  only one of  them.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nelected Ministers who make the final decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary has painted a\r\n\r\nvery gloomy picture of Singapore. Let us see why it\r\n\r\nis  so. Sir, the present Government inherited  from\r\n\r\nthe  former Council a very sound economy and enough\r\n\r\nmoney  in their coffers. The Government have,  from\r\n\r\ntime to time and year by year, been warned that  if\r\n\r\nthey  want to remain economically sound, they  must\r\n\r\npractise    economy    in    administration.    But\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  they  nave  blundered.  They   have\r\n\r\nbetrayed  the voters who have put them into  power.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Labour Front took office  in  1955,  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition  was: liquid reserves, over $200  million;\r\n\r\nduty   on   cigarettes -  full   rate   $6.70,   and\r\n\r\npreferential rate $6.26 per pound; duty  on  petrol\r\n\r\n68  cents  per gallon; income tax 30 per cent.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  they are vacating their office, what are they\r\n\r\nleaving   to   the   incoming  Government?   Liquid\r\n\r\nreserves,  about $83 million; duty  on  cigarettes - full  rate $10.50, preferential rate $10;  duty  on\r\n\r\npetrol  $1 per gallon; income tax, 40 per  cent  on\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  50  per cent  maximum  on  personal\r\n\r\nincomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these three and a half years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have ruined the economy of  this  great\r\n\r\ncity.  This is proved from the figures. It  is  the\r\n\r\nfigures that count, not propaganda and talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the higher the taxation, the higher the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living  will be. Each and  every  one  of\r\n\r\nus - the  trader, the worker, the shop  assistant  or\r\n\r\nthe clerical class - will suffer in the same way.  If\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living is high, the result  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  free  trade centre  and  entrepot\r\n\r\ncannot  exist.  A manufacturer in Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete  with others outside because  his  cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction will be very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of growing population is not\r\n\r\nnew.  Only a foolish Government will attribute this\r\n\r\nposition  of  high  living cost to  the  growth  of\r\n\r\npopulation.  The  population  has  been  increasing\r\n\r\nsince  1945.  This Government came into  office  in\r\n\r\n1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that income tax will be payable by\r\n\r\nthose who are best able to pay. That is quite true.\r\n\r\nBut  Singapore  as  a city is in  a  very  peculiar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition,  and has got to provide bread and  butter\r\n\r\nfor its workers, labourers and others through trade\r\n\r\nor  industry. Now, if the tax is so high, - I am not\r\n\r\ngrumbling,  personally; many  of  us  here  do  not\r\n\r\ngrumble personally about the increase in tax - it  is\r\n\r\nthe people as a whole who are going to suffer. How?\r\n\r\nWill an investor come to Singapore if be has got to\r\n\r\npay such a high rate of taxation? Why should anyone\r\n\r\ntry to have factories in Singapore when the returns\r\n\r\nare  poor?  The  investor  wants  to  find  maximum\r\n\r\nsecurity  for  his money and also maximum  returns.\r\n\r\nNow,  many politicians in this House agree that  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed foreign capital, but the actions of the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Coalition Government - now under  a  different\r\n\r\nlabel  possibly, I do not know - have created such  a\r\n\r\nposition that they are driving away the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at Hongkong. The income tax there is\r\n\r\nonly  12\ufffd per cent. Look at our sister  territory\r\n\r\nBorneo.  Their income tax is 20 per cent. Even  the\r\n\r\nFederation's  income tax is lower.  As  my  friends\r\n\r\nsitting  on  my side have pointed out, and  pointed\r\n\r\nout rightly, the head offices of many companies and\r\n\r\nfactories  here will migrate to some other  places;\r\n\r\nfirst to the Federation, otherwise elsewhere.  That\r\n\r\nis true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tax on petrol has been increased from 68\r\n\r\ncents to $1 per gallon. To day, a group of three or\r\n\r\nfour  assistants  might jointly  own  a  car.  They\r\n\r\nthemselves drive the car. But the increased tax  on\r\n\r\npetrol has hit them. What will these people say  to\r\n\r\nthe  present Ministers? \"We have put you in  office\r\n\r\nand  what  have  you done to us?\"  The  same  thing\r\n\r\napplies  to  the smokers. Of course, the  Ministers\r\n\r\nwill   say   that   we   have  locally - manufactured\r\n\r\ncigarettes. But why should we deprive these smokers\r\n\r\nof the chance to smoke whatever brand they like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question arises as to how the extra\r\n\r\nmoney  is  to be found to meet the deficit  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget. The reply is very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimple. It has been given time and time again.  Cut\r\n\r\ndown  the  administration costs. The administration\r\n\r\ncosts  absorb about 55 to 60 per cent of the  total\r\n\r\nrevenue. A small city like Singapore is swallowing,\r\n\r\nin administration costs alone, so much of the total\r\n\r\nrevenue.  The Government should cut down travelling\r\n\r\nand entertainment allowances, and even salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has no natural resources of its own. It\r\n\r\nhas a population of 1\ufffd million, and the number is\r\n\r\ngrowing  bigger. It has therefore to  live  on  its\r\n\r\nwits.  The householder must live within his income.\r\n\r\nIf he lives by borrowing, he will go to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  but  a bigger house.  The  Ministers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould   similarly  behave  in  a  proper  way   so\r\n\r\nSingapore should live or exist within its income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has misruled the city during\r\n\r\nthese  three  and  a half years.  The  results  are\r\n\r\nhigher   taxation,   widespread  unemployment   and\r\n\r\nmisery. The Government's expenditure has been  very\r\n\r\nextravagant.  The  Ministers' salaries  alone  cost\r\n\r\nabout  $1\ufffd  million.  Travelling,  amusement  and\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowances cost  about  $1  million,\r\n\r\nincluding  the cost of bringing experts over  here.\r\n\r\nSome  might  describe  this  expenditure  of  $2\ufffd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  as chicken feed. It is indeed so to  those\r\n\r\nwho sit on the Government side. But even half of it\r\n\r\ncould  have  been saved to help the unemployed  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children  in  buying  bread  and  milk.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  never thought of  their  welfare.\r\n\r\nThey have no time to think about them. During their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrule  of three and a half years (about 1,270 days),\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  have been out of Singapore,  absent\r\n\r\nfrom   their   duties,  for  1,100  days!   It   is\r\n\r\nastonishing  that  in  a  city  of  the   size   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  each and every Minister  and  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister   should  have  spent  so  much   of   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money  on  travelling!  Was  it  really\r\n\r\nnecessary? I say no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preceding seven years, unofficials who had\r\n\r\nto go to conferences overseas at the request of the\r\n\r\nGovernment had to sacrifice their own income, their\r\n\r\nbusiness profits or vacation leave in order  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  They had been to these places before. They did\r\n\r\nnot go there for sight-seeing or anything of that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsort.  They  were asked to go there to  oblige  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  During these seven years, their  total\r\n\r\ntravelling costs did not come up to even  the  cost\r\n\r\nof one trip of an elected Minister today. Those who\r\n\r\ndoubt  this  can look at the facts. One ministerial\r\n\r\ntrip today has cost much more than all the trips of\r\n\r\nthe unofficials made during these seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an unscrupulous merchant, when he is unable\r\n\r\nto  pay  his  debts,  will just declare  himself  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt  and  change his name.  Today  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront's elected Ministers are politically bankrupt.\r\n\r\nThey  have changed their name. But those whom  they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  taxed are not going to be fooled.  They  know\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  are not attending to their  duties,\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  been absent  from  their  office.\r\n\r\nToday's  voter  is  not a fool.  The  Labour  Front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters  will  be sadly mistaken  if  they  think\r\n\r\nthat,  by  changing  their  names,  they  will   be\r\n\r\nreturned to office again or even to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is quite well known as a central\r\n\r\ncity  in  South-East  Asia and  an  entrepot  trade\r\n\r\ncentre. What publicity does it want for travelling?\r\n\r\nIf  only  $10,000 or $15,000 is spent on  publicity\r\n\r\nprinting and through the Press, it will bring  more\r\n\r\nresults.  The Council of Ministers go out and  when\r\n\r\nthey come back, they report, \"Sorry, we cannot  get\r\n\r\nthe  capital unless there is stability here.\"  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  right thing for them to do would have been  to\r\n\r\nresign in June 1956 when the ex-Chief Minister gave\r\n\r\nup  his  portfolio. They were a minority Government\r\n\r\nand  they  had to pull along with the help  of  ex-officios  and nominated Members, plus favours  from\r\n\r\nthis  side,  from  one or the  other  Party.  Their\r\n\r\nresignations would have brought stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary touched on\r\n\r\nloans, that it will be very difficult in future  to\r\n\r\nget  loans subscribed from outside. This  is  quite\r\n\r\ntrue.  But  why  has the position arisen  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  to  seek loans,  when  they  were\r\n\r\nplaced  in  a financially sound position when  they\r\n\r\nassumed office? They have finished our money.  They\r\n\r\nare  worried. But even now we need not  go  out  to\r\n\r\nfind loans. We have in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough  money.  The only thing lacking  is  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment  responsible to the voters.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  a  Government which, once they  get  elected,\r\n\r\nchange  their  seats  and  their  Parties.  A  good\r\n\r\ngovernment inspires loyalty from its partners. Such\r\n\r\na   government  can  bring  stability  and  inspire\r\n\r\nconfidence in the public. Loans could be  obtained,\r\n\r\nSir.  We  have  the  Central  Provident  Fund.  The\r\n\r\ncurrency   fund  surpluses  can  be   invested   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  land development  or  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nSingapore security? Why `should we invest overseas?\r\n\r\nWhat for? Of course, the reply would be to keep our\r\n\r\ndollar strong and stable, but the same money  could\r\n\r\nbe invested here soundly and we need not go out and\r\n\r\nfind money at a higher rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the insurance companies - they drain\r\n\r\naway   premiums  in  millions.  Why  can   we   not\r\n\r\nnationalise life insurance companies? Why should my\r\n\r\npremium  be invested in any other country? Why  not\r\n\r\nin  Singapore? The Government say they  will  think\r\n\r\nabout  it; but they do not do it because  they  are\r\n\r\ntoo busy planning their trips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy of future governments should be\r\n\r\nat  least  to have one man employed in a family  so\r\n\r\nthat   there  will  be  less  expenditure  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, no worry and less burden on the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people talk of merger and independence.\r\n\r\nIndependence cannot be won by taking trips.  It  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  won  by  ourselves in Singapore,  not  from\r\n\r\noutside. No tom-tom business is necessary. You have\r\n\r\ngot to sacrifice. Everybody wants merger. Many have\r\n\r\nspoken about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, projects like the International Airport, the\r\n\r\nformation  of  the Singapore Telephone  Board,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of Nicoll Highway and Merdeka  Bridge,\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic, housing development, and  so  on,\r\n\r\nwere  planned by the previous Legislative  Council.\r\n\r\nMost  of  these  items  were in  the  1955  Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing that this Government has done is new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as education is concerned, I have to\r\n\r\ngive  this  advice, not, of course, to the  present\r\n\r\ngovernment but to the one which is coming  in,  and\r\n\r\nthat is that they should formulate a policy whereby\r\n\r\nthey should produce craftsmen and mechanics and not\r\n\r\npersons  qualified  only  for  clerical  jobs.  The\r\n\r\nclerical  service is saturated, and if the incoming\r\n\r\ngovernment's  policy is not on  these  lines,  then\r\n\r\nSingapore will be heading for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the life of this present\r\n\r\nGovernment, I will be failing in my duty  if  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  say a few words about the Ministry of Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry. I attach the blame on the Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters - not  on a particular person.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers who make the decision.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Commerce and Industry is the  only\r\n\r\nMinistry - possibly Finance is the second Ministry - on\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore  has  got  to  exist.  Trade   and\r\n\r\nindustry are the two things on which Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngot  to  exist. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce\r\n\r\nhas  to be guided by experienced persons. In former\r\n\r\nyears  they had a Trade Advisory Council and Govern\r\n\r\nment  seldom rejected their advice. A sound  policy\r\n\r\nwould   follow  from  their  advice.  If  that   is\r\n\r\nfollowed, our trade will brighten up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I have always been telling the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that, in order to reduce  unemployment,\r\n\r\nencouragement  should be given  to  handicraft  and\r\n\r\ncottage industries. Sir, in other countries, big or\r\n\r\nsmall,  this  has priority. Women and children  and\r\n\r\nold pensioners, those who cannot actively work, can\r\n\r\ndo  something in the house and sell their  products\r\n\r\nand  thereby make a living out of that. I have said\r\n\r\nfrom  year  to year in this Assembly that  you  can\r\n\r\nalways   get  experts  from  E.C.A.F.E. to   give\r\n\r\nassistance  in  this. What you have  to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  Marketing Board. A poor man  produces\r\n\r\nsomething;  but he cannot keep it for days  in  his\r\n\r\nhouse.  If there is a Marketing Board, he  goes  to\r\n\r\nthe Board and the Board either buys it or gives him\r\n\r\na  little in advance and then sells it later.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhere  are  we going to sell all that is  produced?\r\n\r\nThere are, thousands of people visiting Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  many articles made in other countries are being\r\n\r\nsold  in this City. Why not our own? The only thing\r\n\r\nnecessary is trading initiative. A Marketing  Board\r\n\r\nis necessary. But the Government will say that they\r\n\r\nhave  tried, but with no results at all. If you  go\r\n\r\nto  Burma,  India, Pakistan, or Ceylon,  handicraft\r\n\r\nand  cottage  industries are given priority.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  stay  at home work at them and they have  some\r\n\r\nincome from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to Defence. I remember at the\r\n\r\nlast  Budget  sitting. I fought hard to  scrap  the\r\n\r\nNavy. The Government has been sleeping over it  for\r\n\r\nmore than three years. At last, at the end of their\r\n\r\nterm of office, they are now doing it, or have done\r\n\r\nit.  Now, a small city like Singapore is vulnerable\r\n\r\nto   any  attack.  Should  we  spend  thousands  or\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars on defence? And defence against\r\n\r\nwhom and for whom? Defence is not in our hands.  It\r\n\r\nis  the United Kingdom Government's responsibility.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean that we should not build up some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsort of defence internally. I think we ought to  do\r\n\r\nthat. There is no question about it, but there is a\r\n\r\nlimit.  What is wanted? Those of you who were  here\r\n\r\nduring  the fall of Singapore will agree  that  the\r\n\r\nonly  defence  which  could have  been  useful  was\r\n\r\nagainst  air attacks. Even today, if this could  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped, the money spent on that will be  rightly\r\n\r\nspent.  All other means of defence are useless  and\r\n\r\nwe should not unnecessarily waste money on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other subjects which I will take\r\n\r\nup  in the Committee of Supply, but I will say this\r\n\r\nto  the voters: elect your Ministers correctly, not\r\n\r\nlike  the  Labour Front Ministers who have  brought\r\n\r\nmisery and ruin to Singapore even under its changed\r\n\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr William Tan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

With encouragement, I\r\n\r\nhope  that  trade  and  industry  will  expand  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  produce a healthy economic structure  that\r\n\r\nwill  in  turn  result  in  more  dollars  for  our\r\n\r\nTreasury  and  also help to solve  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to relax the tight\r\n\r\nimmigration laws so that people with money can come\r\n\r\nand invest in this country.

Just work  it\r\n\r\nout - 25   per   cent   of  the   Central   Provident\r\n\r\nFund - millions and millions of our valuable dollars!\r\n\r\nAnd  I  am  not  really surprised,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nirresponsible   statements  made  by  irresponsible\r\n\r\npoliticians   have   also  deterred   people   from\r\n\r\ninvesting  money here.

Why? Because  they  have  no\r\n\r\nconfidence. How can you raise loans and ask them to\r\n\r\nsubscribe to them? The position is such that people\r\n\r\nwith  money  are  investing in Hongkong.  They  buy\r\n\r\nhouses  in  Hongkong. They put  their  earnings  in\r\n\r\nHongkong. Many of them also invest their  money  in\r\n\r\nEngland,   Australia,  India  and   elsewhere.

It is a tabulation\r\n\r\nof  what  revenue Government will receive, what  it\r\n\r\nproposes to spend, and how it proposes to reconcile\r\n\r\nexpenditure with revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of personal income tax and\r\n\r\ncompany  tax is a bold measure as the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment is about to fade from the scene.  It  is\r\n\r\nas  a  Labour Front/Liberal-Socialist Alliance that\r\n\r\nit draws near Judgment Day. Do the Government think\r\n\r\nthat they are actually having Socialist principles?\r\n\r\nLike  repentant sinners, they seek to  make  out  a\r\n\r\nstrong  case for their existence and for the things\r\n\r\nthey should have done, but they have never done it.\r\n\r\nSir,  one  result  of the delay in  not  increasing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany tax earlier is the Government has failed to\r\n\r\nreap  the revenue available in the prosperous  days\r\n\r\nsince  rubber  was  nearer the  $1  mark.  If  this\r\n\r\nmeasure   had  been  taken  four  years  ago,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment could have accumulated enough surplus to\r\n\r\nsee  it through the leaner days, and need not  have\r\n\r\nto  abandon a number of projects because of falling\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of increasing company tax, Sir, was\r\n\r\nraised  a  few  years  ago and the  then  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary justified his refusal to increase company\r\n\r\ntax  on the grounds that a 30 per cent company  tax\r\n\r\nwas   necessary  as  an  inducement   for   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors   as   well  as  local   investors.   The\r\n\r\nimplication, Sir, was that an increase  in  company\r\n\r\ntax  would  drive away foreign capital.  The  large\r\n\r\nprofits  which companies reaped then were sent  out\r\n\r\nof the country and were enough inducement even with\r\n\r\nhigher  personal  income tax or  company  tax.  But\r\n\r\ntoday the Financial Secretary comes forward with  a\r\n\r\nproposal to raise company tax when the profits  are\r\n\r\nnot  so  high.

More important to bear in mind is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  increase of taxation should be  done  in\r\n\r\nsuch   a  way  that  the  nett  value  of  taxation\r\n\r\ncollected would be increased and not decreased.  If\r\n\r\nit  is not for the good intentions of the Ministers\r\n\r\nin  providing  better amenities for the  people,  I\r\n\r\nwould say that they have not been too well advised.\r\n\r\nFrom  the point of taxation, Sir, I always  say  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  take a sane attitude. We must always consider\r\n\r\nour position in relation to our neighbours. We must\r\n\r\nalways  bear  in mind that Singapore is  only  next\r\n\r\ndoor  to  the Federation of Malaya. It is connected\r\n\r\nby  a  causeway which is three-quarters of  a  mile\r\n\r\nlong. We need more capital; we want more factories;\r\n\r\nwe  want  to help people who invest money here,  in\r\n\r\norder  to help us with our employment problem.  But\r\n\r\nif\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  take  any action which will drive them over  to\r\n\r\nthe  other side, then I say that that action is not\r\n\r\nwise. There are two ways whereby business may  stay\r\n\r\nin  this  small island. One is that capital  should\r\n\r\nwant  to  come  and  remain in  Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of   factories,   for   running   better\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  We  must also look at  factories  from\r\n\r\nanother point of view. There must be people to  run\r\n\r\nsuch  factories.  If  the factories  concerned  are\r\n\r\nworthy of consideration, then the executive must be\r\n\r\nmen with the highest qualifications. If we increase\r\n\r\npersonal income tax, would it be conducive for  the\r\n\r\nman  who  is going to run the factory to remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore? Would it not be better for him  just  to\r\n\r\nrent  a  house in Johore Bahru and have residential\r\n\r\nqualification in Johore - say going up  there  during\r\n\r\nthe weekends, visiting his Johore residence once  a\r\n\r\nweek,  and  saying,  \"I am ordinarily  resident  in\r\n\r\nJohore  Bahru,  but I am working in Singapore.\"  If\r\n\r\nsuch  were the case, would not his tax benefit  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, whilst we want,  to  have  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  more  tax  from him  to  increase  our\r\n\r\nrevenue, and losing the whole lot! The talent  will\r\n\r\ngo  over to Johore while he earns his livelihood in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this from another point of view. If\r\n\r\nthere  were two jobs offered - one in the Federation\r\n\r\nand  one  in Singapore - both paying $2,000 a  month.\r\n\r\nWhere  would  the man go to? Would  he  go  to  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation  or would he want to come to  Singapore?\r\n\r\nNo  man is unselfish. No man is not going to  think\r\n\r\nabout  money  if  it is earned by  him.  Many  such\r\n\r\npeople  come from overseas, and I personally  think\r\n\r\nthat  probably  he would go to the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nlive there, thereby losing for us the tax we should\r\n\r\nget from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from the beginning I have said that,\r\n\r\nfactories can only be run on capital and talent. If\r\n\r\nwe  have the capital here but no talent to run  the\r\n\r\nfactories,  we will again lose in the end,  because\r\n\r\nthe  factories will have to shift over to the other\r\n\r\nside.  I  think  this  point  should  be  carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  by the Government and see  what  better\r\n\r\nmethod there is to help Singapore out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days ago we saw an effort made by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry, an elected man.\r\n\r\nHe is concerned about the unemployment problem, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngetting  more capital into Singapore. He  therefore\r\n\r\nintroduced  Bills  in this House for  exemption  of\r\n\r\ntaxation for companies, pioneer industries.  He  is\r\n\r\nworking  in  the right direction. I  supported  him\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly,  and  I  would  say  that  if   all\r\n\r\nMinisters  have the same view, then  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nmove merrily along the road to prosperity. However,\r\n\r\nthe  elected Minister for Commerce and Industry  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to be backed up by another Minister, one\r\n\r\nwho is responsible to Her Majesty's Government, the\r\n\r\npresent  Financial Secretary, who is  nominated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Governor. He is not responsible to the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. He is only interested in seeing that\r\n\r\nthe  Budget is balanced. Whatever happens does  not\r\n\r\nmatter.  This is his last Budget speech, and  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  that  it will be his last. In fact,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  observing all these four years,  that  if  it\r\n\r\nwere  not for the nominated Members in this  House,\r\n\r\nthe Government would have done a little bit better.\r\n\r\nI  quote  a few instances, so that Members in  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  may  be more familiar with what is happening\r\n\r\nbehind the scenes rather than what is presented  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elected Ministers wanted to provide more\r\n\r\namenities  for  the  people.  They  wanted  schools\r\n\r\nbuilt.  They wanted many things done. But that  had\r\n\r\nto go through the hands of the Financial Secretary.\r\n\r\nSanction  had to be obtained from him. In fact,  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  instances, Ministers find that they  have  to\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  him in order that  they  might  draw\r\n\r\nmoney  for the welfare of the people. The Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  says  that this is a standstill  Budget,\r\n\r\nand  that  he  is carrying out the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by creating a standstill  Budget.  That\r\n\r\nmay  very well be so, but I think that when we talk\r\n\r\nabout  a  standstill  Budget, we  cannot  say  that\r\n\r\neverything  is  standing still.  No,  some  of  the\r\n\r\nthings refuse to stand still. Birth rates refuse to\r\n\r\nstand still! Children refuse to stop growing!  They\r\n\r\nmust grow! People who are in school now cannot stop\r\n\r\nin  Form  V  or in the Senior Middle III  and  stop\r\n\r\nproceeding to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  their  certificate! They must get  ahead!  All\r\n\r\nthese  things must come, and although it may  be  a\r\n\r\nstandstill Budget, the important things that cannot\r\n\r\nstand  still  must  be provided for.  I  know  many\r\n\r\nschools   have   plans  to  start   building.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment have agreed to help them, but with  this\r\n\r\nstandstill Budget, how are they going to help them?\r\n\r\nHow  are the plans going to be implemented? I  know\r\n\r\nthe  elected  Ministers are  willing  to  help  the\r\n\r\npeople. But I am afraid the Financial Secretary  is\r\n\r\nnot  of the same frame of mind. I am of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat the elected Ministers have not got the full co-operation  of nominated Ministers. I think,  if  we\r\n\r\nhave  always  been  following  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  in  all  things - whether  it  is  finance,\r\n\r\ntrade,  education or taxation - we should also follow\r\n\r\nthem  in the matter of changes in the Constitution,\r\n\r\nand  that we should ask our appointed officials  to\r\n\r\nleave  gracefully before their time, or  we  use  a\r\n\r\nlittle  force and show them the door, even,  before\r\n\r\nthe  new Constitution comes into play. I am certain\r\n\r\nthat  it  will receive the support of  the  people.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  attach no blame whatsoever on matters  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxation  to the elected Ministers - they  have  done\r\n\r\ntheir  best - I  also feel certain that  the  general\r\n\r\ndirection they have given to the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nof finance has always been backed up by the best of\r\n\r\nintentions to assist the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of such assistance can be seen by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Chief Minister is creating  another\r\n\r\ndepartment called the Rural Development Department,\r\n\r\nand that the Commissioner is asked to assist in the\r\n\r\nneglected   areas   in  the  rural   districts   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  certainly  welcome  this  move.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  intended to  improve  roads.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  intended  to  assist  the  people\r\n\r\nliving  in those areas with better and more  modern\r\n\r\namenities.  That  is  in the right  direction.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment are going to help unemployed people  get\r\n\r\nemployment through the creation of that department.\r\n\r\nThat  is only right, and I hope that the people  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore will come forward and help the Government\r\n\r\nin  carrying out that scheme to help themselves.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly think that more concrete steps like  that\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  make the people feel  that  elected\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  always thinking about their welfare  and  will\r\n\r\nmove  in  such a manner as to assist  them  in  the\r\n\r\nmaximum measures possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngratifying,  I am sure, to the public of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  see their elected stalwarts, after having  said\r\n\r\ntheir  little  pieces prepared for the  newspapers,\r\n\r\nfading  out one by one from this Assembly  Chamber,\r\n\r\nso much so that a few minutes back the stalwarts of\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialist Party were no more  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, and now we see the redoubtable champions  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, the People's Action Party, no more  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  watch after the  public  interests\r\n\r\nagainst  this \"bad\" Government. That is the  amount\r\n\r\nof  interest they take in the affairs of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore. I wish the public could see the state\r\n\r\nof  affairs on the Opposition Benches at this stage\r\n\r\nand  on a debate which has an important bearing  on\r\n\r\nthe public purse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Kampong Kapor this morning\r\n\r\ntouched  upon  the banning of Chinese textiles.  He\r\n\r\npleaded  that  this ban should be  removed  because\r\n\r\nChristmas was coming and the Chinese New  Year  was\r\n\r\ncoming. In my reply to him previously, Sir, I  gave\r\n\r\nhim   an   assurance  that  this   ban   would   be\r\n\r\nreconsidered towards the end of this month  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the circumstances then prevailing and also\r\n\r\nin  the  light of the progress which the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment    is   making   in   its   anti-dumping\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin expressed great happiness\r\n\r\nat  the fact that the Government have succeeded  in\r\n\r\ncutting  down expenditure. But at the same time  he\r\n\r\ncriticised   the   Government   for   producing   a\r\n\r\nstandstill Budget. He said the Government was tired\r\n\r\nand  therefore could not produce anything else than\r\n\r\na  standstill  Budget. I cannot see  the  logic  of\r\n\r\nthese  two  statements.  They  are  conflicting  in\r\n\r\ncharacter   because,  if  he  is   happy   at   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's cutting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown of expenditure, he must also be happy that the\r\n\r\nnatural  sequence  of  this  action  would   be   a\r\n\r\nstandstill  Budget. If he wants a  go-ahead  Budget\r\n\r\nwith   progressive  expenditure,   then   naturally\r\n\r\nexpenditure would increase and he would not then be\r\n\r\nable  to express his happiness at the cutting  down\r\n\r\nof expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member quoted employment figures for\r\n\r\nSingapore's industries and total employment figures\r\n\r\nshowing a downward trend over the last three years.\r\n\r\nSir,  that  is a fact. I have stated all  along  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  House,  even  as recently  as  last  week,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  that  we  are proceeding  on  a  downhill\r\n\r\ncourse in our economy, and that there is nothing we\r\n\r\ncan  do  about it. But, of course, the  reasons  be\r\n\r\ncited   were   entirely  different,  blaming   this\r\n\r\nGovernment for not doing anything. His reasons were\r\n\r\nentirely  different  from  those  quoted   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers as coming from the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nhis  Party, who bluntly blamed the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  But the hon. Member for Tanglin thought  it\r\n\r\nfit to blame this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Opposition Members are not aware that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  quite  a severe  recession - though\r\n\r\ntemporary, fortunately for us and for the  rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  world. Sir, we, who depend on trade and on the\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions of other countries,  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  first  to  be  affected by such  a  recession.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as the Financial Secretary has pointed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  in  his  speech on the Second Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  the effects of that recession were not  more\r\n\r\nsevere than they had been; but a recession of  that\r\n\r\nnature  is something over which we have no control.\r\n\r\nNeither could any other country have any control. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the reason why there is this downward\r\n\r\ntrend  is  not,  as  the  hon.  Member  has  fondly\r\n\r\nsuggested,  because  of  the  ineptitude   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but because, as I have often  said  and\r\n\r\nas  his  own  Party's Secretary-General  has  often\r\n\r\nsaid, it is due to the extreme left-wing in part of\r\n\r\nour  politics.  I  have also to  admit - and  I  have\r\n\r\nadmitted  it  in  the past - it is also  due  to  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Federation Government in imposing  a\r\n\r\ntariff at the Causeway on our industrial goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member complimented me for having\r\n\r\nbrought  up  the Pioneer Industries  Bill,  but  he\r\n\r\nbemoaned  the fact that it is too late.  And  this,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  a  trick -  33 1/3 per  cent  increase  in\r\n\r\ncompany tax. Now from 30 per cent to 40 per cent is\r\n\r\nreally  a  10 per cent increase, but of course,  if\r\n\r\nyou put it in a different way, it is 33 1/3 per cent\r\n\r\nincrease - he is quite correct. That is a very clever\r\n\r\nway of putting it for public consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to point out the\r\n\r\ncontradictory policies of the Government in  having\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils  and  a City  Council.  My  hon.\r\n\r\ncolleague the Minister for Local Government will be\r\n\r\nmore competent to talk about it, but I may just  in\r\n\r\npassing  refer to one or two points. He asked  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen if a road - half of which  was  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  side  and  the  other  half  in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council side - had to be repaired  and  the\r\n\r\ntwo  bodies did not agree with each other? Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  quite possible that they might agree with  each\r\n\r\nother  on  repairing that road, but that point  was\r\n\r\nconveniently lost sight of. Usually in this  world,\r\n\r\nagreement  is  reached on most points; disagreement\r\n\r\narises  only on a few points. But the disagreements\r\n\r\nare  highlighted and therefore they  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nbig.  But  if one pauses to think of the number  of\r\n\r\nthings  on  which agreement is reached between  two\r\n\r\nparties,  then  I think one will not  take  such  a\r\n\r\npessimistic viewpoint as the Member for Tanglin has\r\n\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation  would be easy if we had  one  clear-cut\r\n\r\npolicy  today in the Government. I suggest that  it\r\n\r\nis  not because of a lack of a clear-cut policy  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, but because of the  fact  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  too  many political Parties. If we  had  less\r\n\r\npolitical Parties with more clear-cut policies,  we\r\n\r\nprobably  would  be  nearer to a  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Perhaps I might amplify this point.  It\r\n\r\nis  noticeable now in those circles where the  rich\r\n\r\ncongregate,  drinking their beers and having  their\r\n\r\nfat  lunches,  that  there is a  feeling  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is swinging to the right. Now the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nalways  been  recognised as  an  extreme  left-wing\r\n\r\nParty. That is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  I  meant  when I said less political  Parties\r\n\r\nwith  more  clear-cut policies. One does  not  know\r\n\r\nwhere one stands with certain Parties. If only they\r\n\r\nwould  declare their stand to a certain section  of\r\n\r\nthe  public when they go and talk, \"Oh\", they  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"the  capitalists are bad. The White  man  is\r\n\r\nbad!  This is bad, and that is bad!\" Then they come\r\n\r\nback  and have their lunch and their beer and their\r\n\r\ngolf  with another section of the public; and  they\r\n\r\nwill   say,  \"Oh,  we  want  to  encourage  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital. We will see that capital flourishes\",  and\r\n\r\nall that sort of thing. One does not know where one\r\n\r\nreally is. I would suggest that if hon. Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House were to decide once and for  all  where\r\n\r\nthey stood, it would help Singapore a great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer has a point which\r\n\r\nhe  is  very  fond of repeating, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\ntravelling allowance of the Ministers. But before I\r\n\r\ncome  to that, Sir, there is one other thing  about\r\n\r\nhis speeches that has struck me. The hon. Member is\r\n\r\nsometimes  vehemently opposed  to  colonialism.  He\r\n\r\nshouts  this  out in this House in the presence  of\r\n\r\nthe official Ministers here; but at other times  he\r\n\r\ntakes  pains  to  defend the  previous  Government,\r\n\r\nwhich was a colonial government. So one really does\r\n\r\nnot  know whom he champions - the people's Government\r\n\r\nor the colonial Government. He says this Government\r\n\r\nhave  inherited certain reserves from the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  and we are ruining the economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. He says the elected Government is  bad  as\r\n\r\ncompared to the previous colonial Government. He is\r\n\r\nwelcome to that comparison. Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says, \"Look at Hongkong and Borneo! They\r\n\r\nhave  a  lower rate of taxation.\" We need not  have\r\n\r\nany  taxation at all if we do not want to,  but  we\r\n\r\nmust have it in order to survive, and also in order\r\n\r\nto  provide the social services which the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not provide. Does the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nwant  the  people  of Singapore to  live  like  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Hongkong  do  in  some  parts  of  that\r\n\r\nterritory - in slum areas? If he, who is the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  advocate that the people of Singapore should\r\n\r\nlive in slums like animals, just as they do in some\r\n\r\nparts  of Hongkong, then it is up to the people  to\r\n\r\nreform  their opinion as to whether he is  suitable\r\n\r\nto represent them or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also asks, \"Why do we not cut\r\n\r\ndown  the salaries of the civil service?\" Sir,  the\r\n\r\nhigh  salary structure of the civil service - I admit\r\n\r\nit  is  top-heavy - was  not fixed  by  us.  We  have\r\n\r\ninherited  this salary structure from the  previous\r\n\r\ncolonial Government in whose Legislative Council he\r\n\r\nhad  been  a  Member for at least two terms  before\r\n\r\nthis Assembly came into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is always convenient to quote figures\r\n\r\nshowing  that the Government have spent so much  of\r\n\r\nthe   reserves,  that  these  reserves  have   been\r\n\r\nreduced, that the Government have raised taxes  and\r\n\r\nput  Singapore in a very bad economic  position.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to refer hon. Members to cols. 1064  and\r\n\r\n1065  of the Hansard of 3rd December, 1958, namely,\r\n\r\nthe  speech  given by the Financial  Secretary,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  clearly shown where the money  went.\r\n\r\nSocial  Services  expenditure  in  1954  was   $197\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion;   in  1959  it  will  be  $264  million - an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  35  per cent. Here is the  breakdown:\r\n\r\nEducation in 1954 cost $30 million; in 1959 it will\r\n\r\ncost   $63  million - more  than  double.   How   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have been spending money on  education!\r\n\r\nThe total school population has increased by 66 per\r\n\r\ncent during the last three years - from 1955 to 1958.\r\n\r\nThe  Government have got to find the money, but the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  cannot  be found by the waving  of  a  magic\r\n\r\nwand.  Then  the expenditure on Medical and  Health\r\n\r\nwill  have  risen from $20 million in 1954  to  $34\r\n\r\nmillion in 1959 - approximately 70 per cent increase.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure on Social Welfare will rise from $7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion  to $11 million - 60 per cent increase.  $223\r\n\r\nmillion has been spent on development, out of which\r\n\r\n$56 million went on housing - the provision of houses\r\n\r\nfor the poor people. All these figures are given in\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Secretary's speech, but hon. Members\r\n\r\non the opposite side have probably gummed those two\r\n\r\npages up so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they could not see those figures. $85 million\r\n\r\nwent on other public works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one hon. Member was talking about 1,000\r\n\r\nhouses having been produced and so on. The fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  out  of a total of 20,000 S.I.T. houses  that\r\n\r\nhave  now  been erected, 9,000 units and 300  shops\r\n\r\nhave  been erected in the last three years,  during\r\n\r\nthe  life  of  this Government. The S.I.T. started\r\n\r\nbuilding on a small scale pre-war. After the war - I\r\n\r\nthink  since 1948 or 1949 - 50 per cent of the houses\r\n\r\nthat  have been built have been built in  the  last\r\n\r\nthree  years,  the  other 50 per cent  having  been\r\n\r\nbuilt in the preceding 7 or 8 years. All this costs\r\n\r\nmoney.  On top of that, half the rentals  of  these\r\n\r\nhouses are subsidised by the Government. This is to\r\n\r\nhelp the poorer section of the population. All that\r\n\r\ncosts  money,  and  it is no use  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   have   increased  taxation.   Who   is\r\n\r\nsuffering  as a result of this increased  taxation?\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  the poor man. The man who earns  about\r\n\r\n$10,000 a year or more pays a little more in income\r\n\r\ntax.  Can  any  hon.  Member on the  opposite  side\r\n\r\nsuggest, by any stretch of the imagination, that he\r\n\r\nis  a  poor man who earns $10,000 a year, or nearly\r\n\r\n$1,000  a  month?  These are facts,  Sir,  but,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, hon. Members on the Opposition Benches  are\r\n\r\nquite   capable  of  hiding  the  facts  in   their\r\n\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to the vexed question posed by the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Telok  Ayer  of  travelling  by   the\r\n\r\nMinisters. I have a suspicious feeling, Sir,  that,\r\n\r\nsince  I  was  the last Minister to have  travelled\r\n\r\nthis  year,  I might have to justify my travelling.\r\n\r\nThe  Colombo  Plan Conference is  a  conference  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  countries. There are 18 full-fledged\r\n\r\ncountries  and  three who are not - ourselves,  North\r\n\r\nBorneo  and  Sarawak - we  are  part  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom delegation. It is customary, Sir, that  all\r\n\r\nthe  countries send Ministers to these conferences.\r\n\r\nThe  importance of these conferences lies not  only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the discussions held at the meetings but also in\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  an opportunity is  given  far  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  present  to  meet  one  another  and  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss in private various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings, and it has happened many times that  a  lot\r\n\r\nof   things   have  come  out  of   these   private\r\n\r\ndiscussions.   Sir,  it  has  been  customary   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  send a Minister to the Colombo  Plan\r\n\r\nConference  and to other international  conferences\r\n\r\nlike  that. The hon. Member himself went many times\r\n\r\nas  a Member of the previous Legislative Council at\r\n\r\nthe   taxpayers'   expense,  though   he   had   no\r\n\r\nministerial responsibilities to the public, but  he\r\n\r\nhad  not seen fit at those times to think about the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' money or to criticise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion of handicraft industries. He cited  Burma,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   Pakistan   and   Ceylon   as    having\r\n\r\nhandicrafts.  He forgot one thing, Sir.  Handicraft\r\n\r\nis  a by-product industry of certain waste products\r\n\r\nwhich  a  country may have. In fact, most of  these\r\n\r\ncountries   have  a  varied  type  of  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduction, and out of this agricultural production\r\n\r\nyou get a lot of waste materials which are utilised\r\n\r\nin  handicrafts.  We  have none  and  therefore  we\r\n\r\ncannot have a big scale handicraft industry as such\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru talked about the\r\n\r\nrestriction on imports of cement from China. Let me\r\n\r\nassure him, Sir, that there is no such restriction.\r\n\r\nThe  only  thing is that we issue specific licences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  import  of cement from China but there  is  no\r\n\r\nrestriction on the issue of such licences. They are\r\n\r\nissued  freely.  Sir, I cannot  understand  why  he\r\n\r\nshould  say  that  there is a  restriction  on  the\r\n\r\nimport of cement from China. There is none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he chided the elected Government for\r\n\r\ninvesting 25 per cent of the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nmoney overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Is it not true?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> He is well aware, Sir, that\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund investments are controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of the Provident Fund, and the Board act  as\r\n\r\ntrustees  for the public whose monies are  held  by\r\n\r\nthe  Provident Fund, and as trustees  they  have  a\r\n\r\nlegal  duty  to  see  that  the  funds  are  safely\r\n\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member started shouting about\r\n\r\nmerger.  He said the way the Government  was  going\r\n\r\nabout it was not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndignified.  And then he climaxed his criticisms  on\r\n\r\nmerger  by asking: \"Why should we talk of  merger?\"\r\n\r\nYet,  Sir, I have on many occasions heard his Party\r\n\r\nSecretary saying that the Party line is merger with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. In fact, only last week, I  think,\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers carried the Liberal-Socialist Party\r\n\r\nline  on merger, but the hon. Member does not  seem\r\n\r\nto toe the Party line. He asks, \"Why should we talk\r\n\r\nof merger with the Federation?\" Those, Sir, are the\r\n\r\ninconsistencies of hon.

Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few of the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members have seen fit to allege that the\r\n\r\nGovernment have done nothing during the  past  3\ufffd\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to submit that the Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment during its term of office have made  far\r\n\r\nmore  progress  in almost all directions  than  any\r\n\r\nother administration in Singapore has been able  to\r\n\r\nmake, despite attempts by certain political Parties\r\n\r\nto   disrupt   the   progress  of   the   Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, ours is a record of which  we  are\r\n\r\nproud  to present at any place and at any time.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  written  in gold in  the  annals  of  the\r\n\r\nhistory of the elected Governments of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We   have   repeatedly   refuted   the\r\n\r\ndistortion  of our records and I am glad  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  have now begun to realise the truth of  the\r\n\r\nmatter,  the honesty and sincerity of our Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the Government in the discharge of our  duties\r\n\r\nand responsibilities to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one hon. Member stated that this Budget\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  a \"tired\" Government's  Budget  in\r\n\r\nwhich  there  is no plan and no programme.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\ncompletely  disagree with this  statement.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, I believe that this year's Budget  was\r\n\r\ndeliberately made a standstill Budget for the  main\r\n\r\nreason that the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment should be left to review the  Budget  in\r\n\r\nthe  light of its own policies. Sir, I will  assure\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member and this House that when  we  form\r\n\r\nthe new fully elected government next year, we will\r\n\r\nrevise this Budget and amend it in conformity  with\r\n\r\nthe  new  economic, social and dynamic policies  of\r\n\r\nthe new Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget before this House is in no way a\r\n\r\n\"tired\"   Government's  Budget.  Our  new  policies\r\n\r\ncannot  be revealed at the moment. They are  secret\r\n\r\nand  they  will be presented to the people  in  our\r\n\r\nmanifesto in the coming general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Mason has stated in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the  increase in  company  tax  and\r\n\r\nincome  tax  is  causing hardship to companies  and\r\n\r\nindividuals.  I  believe  this  increase  is  fully\r\n\r\njustified and I am convinced that it will not be  a\r\n\r\nburden on the companies and individuals. Sir, in  a\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  everyone who is able  to  pay  adequate\r\n\r\ntaxes  must  pay to the government for the  welfare\r\n\r\nand  happiness of the people. I do hope, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  companies  and individuals will  change  their\r\n\r\noutlook  and have a national outlook in our  future\r\n\r\neconomy.  May  I also hope that the  companies  and\r\n\r\nindividuals  accept these increases  cheerfully  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In reply, Sir. Before dealing with the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of hon. Members, there are a few  general\r\n\r\nremarks which I would like to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, nobody, with the\r\n\r\npossible exception of the Member for Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nhas  said  anything  about the fact  that  we  have\r\n\r\nvirtually balanced the Budget and have handed  over\r\n\r\na  financial position which is sound and completely\r\n\r\nunder control. I am sorry to labour the point, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think  that if one remembers the  pressures\r\n\r\nunder which the Government has worked and the  vast\r\n\r\namount  which  it has achieved, then  one  realises\r\n\r\nthat  this  balancing  of  the  Budget  is  a  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second place, Sir, while everybody with\r\n\r\nperhaps one exception has complained bitterly about\r\n\r\nthe  increase in taxation and had made  some  quite\r\n\r\nastonishing  statements about the  consequences  of\r\n\r\nthe  measures  which we have introduced,  only  one\r\n\r\nhon.  Member has suggested what we should do as  an\r\n\r\nalternative  for  the  purpose  of  balancing   the\r\n\r\nBudget.  This is very strange, Sir, for  I  imagine\r\n\r\nthat  all  hon. Members who have spoken  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  virtues  of making revenue balance expenditure\r\n\r\nand of cutting one's coat according to one's cloth.\r\n\r\nAm  I to take it, Sir, that prudent businessmen who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  spoken and who presumably have some sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the Colony's finances - otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  be  sitting  where  they  are - are\r\n\r\nprepared  to face a deficit of $20 million  in  the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances with equanimity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the hon. Members, Sir, who spoke referred\r\n\r\nto  the  new measures of taxation which  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced and I shall endeavour to reply  to  them\r\n\r\nat  the  risk  of being repetitive. In replying  to\r\n\r\nthis  debate, I shall have to repeat  most  of  the\r\n\r\npoints   that   I  shall  have  to   mention   when\r\n\r\nintroducing the Bill and the motion standing in  my\r\n\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Mason, Sir, criticised the increase\r\n\r\nin  income tax and company tax in very strong terms\r\n\r\nindeed.   He   did  not,  of  course,   offer   any\r\n\r\nalternative  to  the balancing of  the  Budget.  He\r\n\r\nstigmatized   the  increase  in  company   tax   as\r\n\r\ndownright  silly  and  calculated  to  thrust   the\r\n\r\nconvalescent body of Singapore business  back  into\r\n\r\nits  bed  of sickness. This, of course, is absolute\r\n\r\nnonsense.  We  are confident that even  in  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances  Singapore  business  can  bear  this\r\n\r\nimpost, still expand and still make its profits. We\r\n\r\nwould  not have imposed the increase in tax  if  we\r\n\r\nhad  not been confident of that. Incidentally, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  regard the hon. Member's veiled suggestion  that\r\n\r\nwe  should take advantage of the Federation  having\r\n\r\nraised company tax to keep ours at a lower rate  as\r\n\r\nmost  reprehensible, as I did the other  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat the Federation might take advantage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  higher rate of individual tax in the  same\r\n\r\nway.  Does the hon. Member not realise that we have\r\n\r\nthe   closest   possible  consultation   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation in these matters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also some wild statements about the\r\n\r\ndangers of having different rates of individual tax\r\n\r\nin   Singapore:  the  administrative  inconvenience\r\n\r\nwould  be appalling; taxpayers would arrange  their\r\n\r\nincomes  so  as  to  avoid tax; salaried  employees\r\n\r\nwould  leave Singapore for the Federation,  and  so\r\n\r\non.  These statements merely indicate a fundamental\r\n\r\nignorance  of  income  tax administration.  As  the\r\n\r\npresent  basis  of assessment and  collection  will\r\n\r\nremain  as it is, there is no question of taxpayers\r\n\r\nmoving  their  sources  of  income  to  suit  their\r\n\r\nconvenience.  The  only  criticism  which  can   be\r\n\r\nlevelled is that some taxpayers might be tempted to\r\n\r\nchange  residence,  but I honestly  doubt  if  this\r\n\r\ncriticism is very realistic. The difference of rate\r\n\r\nhas to be very wide to cause this to take place and\r\n\r\nthose  who  make the change must be satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthe   differential  is  likely  to  exist   for   a\r\n\r\nsufficiently   long  time  to   make   the   change\r\n\r\nworthwhile. Only the very large taxpayers would  be\r\n\r\nlikely  to consider such a move and there are  many\r\n\r\naspects  of  the matter which they  would  wish  to\r\n\r\nconsider with great care before making a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew spoke of the\r\n\r\nvery  high rate of personal income tax in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  drew  comparison with Hongkong.  I  must  say,\r\n\r\nhowever, as I will show when introducing the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthat our rates are still low compared with those of\r\n\r\nother   countries.  Hongkong,  of  course,  is   an\r\n\r\nexception  and I think that we would all wish  that\r\n\r\nthe  economic  conditions which exist  in  Hongkong\r\n\r\ncould  be duplicated in Singapore. The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nwas,  of course, incorrect in saying that we raised\r\n\r\nincome  tax  last  year. The last increase  was  in\r\n\r\n1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must argue with the hon. Member when he called\r\n\r\nthe  increase in company tax crushing.  As  I  will\r\n\r\nshow  when  introducing the Bill we  still  have  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  margin  of  advantage  compared  with\r\n\r\nother countries. Nor can I agree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the  new  taxes  weigh  penally  either   on\r\n\r\nindividuals   or   companies.  I   appreciate   his\r\n\r\nsuggestion  about welfare lotteries and  a  tax  on\r\n\r\nbookmakers.  I personally would welcome  a  welfare\r\n\r\nlottery,   preferably  in  conjunction   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, because I think in  that  way\r\n\r\nwe  might  extract the maximum financial advantage,\r\n\r\nbut   I   think  that  he  has  rather  tended   to\r\n\r\noverestimate the yield. A tax on bookmakers  raises\r\n\r\nvery difficult problems indeed, and the yield would\r\n\r\nnot be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Queenstown spoke about the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  income  tax  causing  a  movement  of\r\n\r\nofficers into the Federation, but I think  that  he\r\n\r\nmust  have gained a wrong impression of the  effect\r\n\r\nof the new rates. I will explain this later when  I\r\n\r\nmove a motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar accused us of\r\n\r\nrunning  down  our  reserves. In the  first  place,\r\n\r\nthese reserves were largely accumulated as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  Korean war boom and the inability  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to spend all it wished. Over  the  past\r\n\r\nfour  years  we have spent exactly $140-million  of\r\n\r\nthese  reserves.  In  doing  so,  we  have  avoided\r\n\r\nincreasing the public debt and interest in  Sinking\r\n\r\nFund charges. We have let the loan market free  for\r\n\r\nthe  City Council and enabled it to do a very great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  development  in the  field  of  essential\r\n\r\npublic  utilities. In addition,  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nwhat I regard as a monumental amount of development\r\n\r\non  our  own account in social and other  services.\r\n\r\nDespite  all that we have done, we have managed  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand  over a sound financial position with adequate\r\n\r\nreserves.  What would he have had us  do?  Let  the\r\n\r\nreserves  accumulate and do nothing for the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also spoke in strong terms about the folly in\r\n\r\nincreasing company tax at this juncture, and  asked\r\n\r\nus why we had not raised it earlier. We only regret\r\n\r\nthe  necessity in doing it at the present time, but\r\n\r\nit is not folly, far from it. We are satisfied that\r\n\r\nthe  increase can be absorbed even at  the  present\r\n\r\ntime. As regards the question of why we have not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised the question of company tax later, that is a\r\n\r\nmatter  which  I will go into when I introduce  the\r\n\r\nBill dealing with the increased rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards individual rates, I can assure the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member that we would not have raised them  by\r\n\r\nthe  small amount that we have done if we  had  not\r\n\r\nbeen  quite  certain that it could be done  without\r\n\r\nloss  of  revenue or loss of taxpayers and  without\r\n\r\ndanger to the Pan-Malayan approach to income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Rural Development Vote, what is\r\n\r\nmore  of the very nature of rural development  than\r\n\r\nthe  construction of kampong roads and drains? That\r\n\r\nis  what the Rural Development Vote is being  spent\r\n\r\non at the present time. Does he think that this can\r\n\r\nbe  done without labour? Does he suggest that there\r\n\r\nshould be no unemployment relief?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may say so, my friend the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin   spoiled  what  I  thought  was  a   quite\r\n\r\nexcellent speech by referring to the Budget as that\r\n\r\nof  a tired government. That, of course, is not the\r\n\r\ncase.  We have cut our coat according to our cloth,\r\n\r\nand   avoided  cutting  patterns  for  non-existing\r\n\r\ncloth.  It  is difficult to be imaginative  without\r\n\r\nfunds,  and  the  general impression  one  gets  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  debate  is that funds are the  last  thing\r\n\r\nwhich  hon.  Members would be prepared to  provide.\r\n\r\nThe  question  of  selling fiats is  not  quite  as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimple as he would have us believe, but it is being\r\n\r\nlooked   into  by  the  Government.  I   was   most\r\n\r\ninterested   to   hear  his   proposals   for   the\r\n\r\nrationalization of administration of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nI  hope  he  will develop his arguments further  at\r\n\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards flood alleviation, we are pressing\r\n\r\nahead  as  fast as funds will allow.  Part  of  the\r\n\r\ntroubles of which he is aware is caused by  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The passenger transit  phase  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport has not been shelved. It is the third phase\r\n\r\nof   a  planned  development  of  the  Airport.   I\r\n\r\nappreciate what he says about cultural affairs  but\r\n\r\nI  think the amount provided will be sufficient for\r\n\r\nall practical purposes in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi asked a string of\r\n\r\nquestions which I doubt if I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave sufficient time to answer in full. I must deny\r\n\r\nhis  statement that in my Budget speech I attempted\r\n\r\nto  glorify the colonial Government at the  expense\r\n\r\nof the elected Government. Nothing was further from\r\n\r\nmy  thoughts.  I  merely  stated  facts  about  the\r\n\r\nposition  as  regards  the  long-term  loan  market\r\n\r\nwhich,  as  everybody will admit, is  as  much  the\r\n\r\nresult of world conditions as local conditions. The\r\n\r\nmarket  conditions  for a floatation  of  long-term\r\n\r\nloans   have  changed  very  greatly,  particularly\r\n\r\nduring  the last four years. People are  no  longer\r\n\r\nattracted by long-term low interest-bearing  loans.\r\n\r\nEmphasis  is  on short-term loans. As  regards  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlack  of  confidence, there is  always  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nconfidence at the time of political change. That is\r\n\r\ninevitable. It has been aggravated at this time  by\r\n\r\nthe vehemence of certain political Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to have said so little about\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. It was merely because I did  not\r\n\r\nwish  to steal the Minister's thunder by taking  up\r\n\r\ntoo  much  time. I was astonished to hear the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember's  statement to the effect that wage-earners\r\n\r\nwere  affected  by  the increase  in  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nindividual income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must thank my friend the hon. Member for Telok\r\n\r\nAyer  for his kind words about the Budget.  I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out, however, that this Budget was  prepared\r\n\r\nby  the Chief Minister and all the other Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe  figures  which deal with the reserve  position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  correct.  I do not question them.  But  he  is\r\n\r\nquite  wrong when he said that we have  ruined  the\r\n\r\neconomy. The figures certainly do not suggest  that\r\n\r\nat all. They merely point out that we have balanced\r\n\r\nincome  and expenditure and have done a very  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of development work, and yet are left with  a\r\n\r\nsound position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of population is not a new problem, as\r\n\r\nhe   says,  but  it  is  a  problem  which  becomes\r\n\r\nprogressively more acute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax rates are not so high as to discourage\r\n\r\ninvestors.  It is wrong to say that we are  driving\r\n\r\naway   capital.  On  the  contrary,  We  are  doing\r\n\r\neverything we can to attract it. As long as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany  rates  are  the  same  as  those  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation, there will be no migration of companies\r\n\r\nto  the Federation on that account. The increase in\r\n\r\npetrol  duty  in  the  past  has  long  since  been\r\n\r\nabsorbed  without  any  difficulty.  There  is   no\r\n\r\nhardship, as I will point out in due course, in the\r\n\r\nnew  cigarette duty. I wish somebody would  explain\r\n\r\nto  me  how  we  can  cut  down  in  administrative\r\n\r\nexpenses.  For  four years now I  have  heard  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition say these must  be  cut\r\n\r\ndown,  but  never on one occasion have  I  had  any\r\n\r\nconcrete suggestion as to how that might be done. I\r\n\r\nthink  we have done everything we possibly  can  to\r\n\r\nreduce administrative expenses to the minimum.  The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  has much to say about  administrative\r\n\r\nsalaries  and about the monies spent in  travelling\r\n\r\nand  on  entertainment. I must say, Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\namounts  of  money spent under these  headings  are\r\n\r\nabsolutely insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt already with the question which he\r\n\r\nraised  in connection with the floatation of loans.\r\n\r\nWe  feel confident that the Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill support any Government loans in the future. He\r\n\r\nhas  suggested  that we might invest  the  currency\r\n\r\nfunds  locally.  I think a certain  amount  can  be\r\n\r\ninvested locally, but it must be remembered that it\r\n\r\nis absolutely essential to keep the backing for the\r\n\r\ncurrency  liquid, available at all  times.  In  the\r\n\r\nabsence of a local loan market, it is impossible to\r\n\r\ninvest locally and keep the fund liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate what the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\nhas  said about the entrepot trade. I think it will\r\n\r\nbe generally agreed that we have done everything we\r\n\r\npossibly  can to maintain the free port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to  encourage the  entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  cannot agree with him that  we  should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfollow an independent trade policy. As I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  on  a  number of occasions, it is  absolutely\r\n\r\nessential  that  we form a common  economic  policy\r\n\r\nwith the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must confess, Sir, that I have never\r\n\r\nheard so much unadulterated rubbish as I have heard\r\n\r\nfrom the hon. Member for Serangoon this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Hart):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  His Excellency's authority to move the Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is a very simple one. Its object is to\r\n\r\nincrease the rate of tax on the chargeable  incomes\r\n\r\nof  companies from 30 per cent to 40 per  cent,  to\r\n\r\nenable companies to deduct tax at the new rate from\r\n\r\ndividends  paid to shareholders, and to enable  the\r\n\r\nnew  rate to be levied on the chargeable income  of\r\n\r\nnon-resident individuals, trustees (other than  the\r\n\r\ntrustees  of incapacitated persons) and  executors,\r\n\r\nand  on  the interest on debentures, mortgages  and\r\n\r\nloans  paid to non-residents. To this end, sections\r\n\r\n43,  44  and  45  of the Income Tax  Ordinance  are\r\n\r\namended in the manner indicated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to increase the rate of tax on the\r\n\r\nchargeable incomes of companies has not been  taken\r\n\r\nlightly or without careful consideration of all the\r\n\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been of the opinion for some\r\n\r\ntime  that  the  rate  of tax  could  be  increased\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  It  has  been  supported  in   this\r\n\r\nopinion by its Economic Advisers who have both held\r\n\r\nthe  view  that  the  rate could  be  substantially\r\n\r\nincreased without doing harm either to the  general\r\n\r\neconomy  of Singapore or to the companies affected.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  supported by an examination  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults  achieved  by companies  operating  locally\r\n\r\nover  a period of years, which, by and large,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  extremely  good. It has been supported  by  a\r\n\r\ncomparison of the company rate in Malaya  with  the\r\n\r\nrates  applied  to  companies  operating  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries. It has been supported by the  fact  that\r\n\r\nleaders of the business community have from time to\r\n\r\ntime privately expressed the view that company  tax\r\n\r\ncould stand some increase without causing very much\r\n\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Government has so far been unwilling to\r\n\r\ntake  action to raise the rate of tax because other\r\n\r\nsources of revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  remain  to be tapped; because  the  pressing\r\n\r\nneed  for  more  revenue which  would  justify  the\r\n\r\nimposition   could  not  be  clearly  demonstrated;\r\n\r\nbecause,  in this more than in any other sphere  of\r\n\r\ndirect  taxation, common action with the Federation\r\n\r\nwas  essential; because we wished to do  everything\r\n\r\npossible to attract investment capital and  because\r\n\r\nwe  feared that an increase in the rate of  company\r\n\r\ntax,   in   the  absence  of  any  counterbalancing\r\n\r\nlegislation  such as Pioneer Industry  legislation,\r\n\r\nmight inhibit investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the matter has been precipitated by the\r\n\r\nneed for more revenue to meet the cost of essential\r\n\r\nservices  like police, defence, education, medical,\r\n\r\nhealth, and communications, without which companies\r\n\r\ncould not exist, far less make profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for increased revenue has been clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated and the point need not be  elaborated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  I  think  it  has  also  been   clearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemonstrated that Government expenditure  has  been\r\n\r\ncut  to  the bone and that provision has only  been\r\n\r\nmade  for what is generally agreed to be essential.\r\n\r\nI  mention this because, in the past, any  increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  direct, or indeed in any, taxation has met with\r\n\r\na   storm   of  protest  against  the   waste   and\r\n\r\nextravagance   of   Government   expenditure,   the\r\n\r\nargument being that no increased taxation would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  if  Government  would  only  limit   its\r\n\r\nexpenditure to what was essential. The argument  is\r\n\r\nno  longer valid - if indeed it ever were valid.  All\r\n\r\nother  sources  of  revenue  within  the  customary\r\n\r\npattern  of  taxation have been  exhausted.  Direct\r\n\r\ntaxation under the Income Tax Ordinance is the main\r\n\r\nsource  remaining. Of the sources in the  field  of\r\n\r\ndirect taxation, company tax is the most productive\r\n\r\nand  likely  to give the greatest yields  over  the\r\n\r\nlongest  period.  The Government has  therefore  no\r\n\r\noption but to avail itself of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, the Government regrets\r\n\r\nthat  it  has to introduce this measure at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen the economy is in process of throwing off  the\r\n\r\neffects  of  a  recession. It would naturally  have\r\n\r\npreferred  to delay introduction until the  economy\r\n\r\nwas back in full stride as it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere.  This, however, has not proved possible.  The\r\n\r\nneed for revenue outweighs other considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it must be pointed out that the\r\n\r\neffects  of the increase will certainly not  be  as\r\n\r\ndisastrous  to the economy as some of  the  critics\r\n\r\nwho  have  ventilated  their views  would  have  us\r\n\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase is from 30 per cent to 40 per cent\r\n\r\nand it is generally accepted that 30 per cent is  a\r\n\r\nvery  low  figure. Neither the increase itself  nor\r\n\r\nthe  new  rate  can  be called crippling,  as  some\r\n\r\ncritics  have termed it, and I confidently  believe\r\n\r\nthat  companies operating in Singapore will be able\r\n\r\nto absorb the increase without undue difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rate of 40 per cent still maintains a\r\n\r\nfairly substantial favourable margin compared  with\r\n\r\nthe  rates in other countries from which one  might\r\n\r\nexpect  to attract investment capital. For example,\r\n\r\nin  the United States, companies are charged  at  a\r\n\r\ngraduated rate which varies from 42 per cent to  52\r\n\r\nper  cent. In Canada, 18 per cent is charged on the\r\n\r\nfirst $25,000 of profit and 45 per cent on anything\r\n\r\nin  excess  of $25,000. In the United Kingdom,  the\r\n\r\nstandard rate is 42\ufffd per cent plus a profits  tax\r\n\r\nof 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the new rate compares very favourably\r\n\r\nwith  that  in most of the countries in Asia  which\r\n\r\ncan be regarded as competing with us for investment\r\n\r\ncapital. For example, the standard rate in India is\r\n\r\n30  per  cent with a surcharge of 30 per  cent.  In\r\n\r\nCeylon the standard rate is 45 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these considerations, I doubt very\r\n\r\nmuch  whether the increase in rate will  act  as  a\r\n\r\nspecial disincentive to investment capital. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, capital looks mainly to questions  of\r\n\r\n\"yield\".  It asks itself whether the prospects  are\r\n\r\nsufficiently good to justify investment.  Will  the\r\n\r\ninvestment be safe enough? Will it yield enough  to\r\n\r\nmeet  all expenses, including tax, and yet  make  a\r\n\r\nlarger  profit  than  it would make  elsewhere?  If\r\n\r\nthese  criteria are applied to the past, the answer\r\n\r\nmust be a spontaneous, unanimous and overwhelming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffirmative.  There  is  perhaps  more  uncertainty\r\n\r\nabout  the  future.  That  is  inevitable  in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, as I have said in other connections.\r\n\r\nBut  I am sufficiently confident in the common  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommercial  sense  of the people of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\ntheir elected representatives to believe that  they\r\n\r\nwill  do  nothing  to  destroy  but  everything  to\r\n\r\nimprove the climate for investment. In short,  once\r\n\r\nthe  political  picture clarifies itself,  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  prospects for investment in  the  future\r\n\r\nwill  be  such  that  it will  take  more  than  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 30 per cent to 40 per cent in the  rate\r\n\r\nof company tax to deter investment capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these considerations, however, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is in process of introducing legislation\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give tax concessions to new industries\r\n\r\nand   to  existing  industries  which  inject   new\r\n\r\ncapital. As far as such undertakings are concerned,\r\n\r\nthese    measures   should   counter-balance    any\r\n\r\ndetrimental  effects which might conceivably  arise\r\n\r\nas  a result of the increase in the rate of company\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate of tax applicable to\r\n\r\nexecutors and trustees will not involve the  degree\r\n\r\nof hardship which appears at first sight. Executors\r\n\r\nare  entitled to claim relief at the increased rate\r\n\r\nof  40 per cent in respect of all distributions  to\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  which are made within  a  prescribed\r\n\r\nperiod, with the result that beneficiaries resident\r\n\r\nin  Malaya are likely to receive the same amount of\r\n\r\nincome as they could have received if the rate  had\r\n\r\nnot   been  increased.  So  far  as  trustees   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they distribute the income of the  trust\r\n\r\nunder  deduction of tax and beneficiaries are  able\r\n\r\nto  claim repayment or a set-off, as in the case of\r\n\r\ncompany  dividends, in respect of the 40  per  cent\r\n\r\ntax deducted from what they receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to non-residents, it is\r\n\r\nadministratively desirable that the rate should  be\r\n\r\nthe same as that at which companies deduct tax from\r\n\r\ndividends. The great majority of non-residents  who\r\n\r\nderive income from Singapore do so in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform of company dividends: if the non-resident rate\r\n\r\nwere greater than the rate at which tax is deducted\r\n\r\nfrom  dividends it would be impossible  to  collect\r\n\r\nthe difference from non-residents: if the rate were\r\n\r\nlower,  every  non-resident would automatically  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to  claim  relief  in  respect   of   the\r\n\r\ndifference  between the non-resident rate  and  the\r\n\r\nrate  at  which  tax  has been  deducted  from  his\r\n\r\ndividends,  and a substantial amount of  additional\r\n\r\nwork  would be thrown on the Income Tax Department.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that most non-residents either have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  title  to  claim a proportion  of  the  personal\r\n\r\nreliefs  and the graduated rates of tax  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of  section  40  of  the  income   Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  or  are  resident in territories  which\r\n\r\ngive  to their residents double taxation relief  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of income which is taxed both in Singapore\r\n\r\nand in the territory of residence, the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  rate  to  40  per  cent will  add  little,  if\r\n\r\nanything, to their existing tax bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much has been\r\n\r\nsaid about the increase of income tax in the Budget\r\n\r\nspeeches,  and I will therefore be very  brief.  As\r\n\r\nyou  will see, Government expenditure has increased\r\n\r\nby leaps and bounds. That is why taxation has to be\r\n\r\nincreased  to  meet the increase in expenditure.  I\r\n\r\nquote, Sir, from page 13 of the Draft Estimates. In\r\n\r\n1954,  the  expenditure was about $249 million;  in\r\n\r\n1955,  when  there  was  a  trade  recession,   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure was about $198 million; but in 1956, it\r\n\r\nwas  $222  million; in 1957, it was  $238  million;\r\n\r\nand,  for  the  present, the  expenditure  is  $265\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  Financial Secretary might  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  is inevitable. At this stage, I am not  going\r\n\r\nto oppose such an increase, since the doers of this\r\n\r\nwrong  act will be staying in office for only three\r\n\r\nmore  months. The new Government will, I  am  sure,\r\n\r\nreduce  not  only income tax, but also the  tax  on\r\n\r\npetrol, tobacco and some other items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Financial Secretary has said that nobody\r\n\r\nhas  given  any concrete suggestions as to  how  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  deficit  in the Budget.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been told every year to cut down the\r\n\r\nadministrative  costs. I have said it  every  year.\r\n\r\nYou  might  ask  how? Sir, I have  said  that  non-Singaporean officers - may I use the words expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers', who are not Singaporeans, Sir? Will  you\r\n\r\nallow that, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> In the past, expatriate officers\r\n\r\nhad  been  drawing high salaries, and  rightly  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  they had to run one house in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nin  Malaya,  and one house in England or  India  or\r\n\r\nCeylon,  or  wherever it may be, and the  cost  was\r\n\r\ntherefore  very high. But this should  not  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  as  and  when these officers are replaced  by\r\n\r\nlocal  men,  including the Ministers.  I  will  say\r\n\r\nthis: that, as far as the lower-grade officers  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  they  should  be  properly  paid.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not  be made to suffer. But  do  the  local\r\n\r\nofficers  in  the higher grades really require  the\r\n\r\nsame  level  of  salary  scale  as  the  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers?  They were able to live on  a  salary  of\r\n\r\n$200  or $500 or $600 before. Why should they  want\r\n\r\nto  live  now on a salary of $1,500 or $2,500?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should therefore cut down the salary  of\r\n\r\nthese officers, and not make the taxpayers bear the\r\n\r\nincreased   cost   of  Government  expenditure   by\r\n\r\nimposing higher taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got very little to add, for this\r\n\r\nGovernment,  or these people who form  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment,  will  not see this House  again.  They\r\n\r\nwill  not be elected and put to office in the  next\r\n\r\nelections.  Therefore,  they  will  not  be  in   a\r\n\r\nposition to increase taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\noppose  this  motion.  As  I  have  mentioned  this\r\n\r\nmorning,  the  present  Government  is  in  a  very\r\n\r\npeculiar  position  in  that  it  has  a  nominated\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance to present the Budget,  which\r\n\r\nis  an  anti-climax. Also, it has been admitted  by\r\n\r\nthe mover of this motion, that it is not opportune\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  this  juncture to increase the rate  of  income\r\n\r\ntax.  What I would like to emphasize, Sir, is  that\r\n\r\nour  economic stability is not only affected by the\r\n\r\npresent  world  trade recession,  but  it  is  also\r\n\r\naffected  by  our economic policy. We do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government's economic policy is  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time.  Is it Pan-Malayan? Has  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic policy of increased taxation followed  the\r\n\r\nFederation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has said that he is\r\n\r\nconfident that, with this increase in taxation,  he\r\n\r\ncan expect an increase in revenue. Sir, you may  be\r\n\r\nright  if  you  say that to, say, a primary  school\r\n\r\nstudent. One plus one is two. When you increase the\r\n\r\nrate  of taxation, you can expect a bigger revenue.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is  also another method of computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo plus zero is also equal to two. Therefore, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif you now increase the rate of company tax, do you\r\n\r\nexpect  to  attract investors to this  country?  Of\r\n\r\ncourse not! If you cannot attract investors to this\r\n\r\ncountry, how do you ever expect to have any company\r\n\r\nmaking  a  profit to pay tax and thus increase  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can quote an editorial comment in the\r\n\r\nNanyang  Siang  Pau  on this Budget.  The  Editor\r\n\r\nviewed   with   mixed  feelings  the   Government's\r\n\r\nproposal  to  increase the rate of  taxation.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment - by   which   I   mean   the    Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary - is  not  facing  realities.  It  is   not\r\n\r\nadopting a practical approach in the preparation of\r\n\r\nthis  Budget. You know very well that  business  is\r\n\r\nvery  bad and yet you expect to be able to tax  the\r\n\r\nprofits  of  a  company. It is just like  borrowing\r\n\r\nmoney  from a beggar. You know he is a beggar,  and\r\n\r\nyet you expect to borrow money from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I think there are\r\n\r\nmany  ways  of increasing our revenue to  meet  our\r\n\r\nfinancial   commitments,  other  than  the   simple\r\n\r\nprocess  of passing a Bill to increase the rate  of\r\n\r\ntaxation.

They all give the same answer, \"No  good.\r\n\r\nThe  future  is no good. Business is no good.\"  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  generally  have  lost  confidence  in   the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Why? Why does the Financial Secretary  not\r\n\r\nfind out the fundamental cause of the trouble which\r\n\r\nhas  brought about the economic instability in this\r\n\r\ncountry, and then find a solution to the problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Opposition Members\r\n\r\nonly  know how to criticize the Government but  are\r\n\r\nnever   able   to  put  forward  any   constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  I  would  like  to  put  forward  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as  solutions to  our  economic  ills.\r\n\r\nEither one of them will help to solve our problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  is the well-known formula - let Singapore  merge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation  of Malaya  immediately.  The\r\n\r\nother formula may be new, Sir, but it is already so\r\n\r\ncommonly  discussed in the coffee-shops and  market\r\n\r\nplaces. It is that it is time for Singapore to have\r\n\r\nits  own  independent economic policy to  safeguard\r\n\r\nits  rice  bowl.  All  say  that  it  is  time  for\r\n\r\nSingapore to think of a way to make its own living.\r\n\r\nPolitical  leaders  may  continue  dreaming  of   a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  merger or marriage with the  Federation,\r\n\r\nand  believe  in  the sincerity  of  a  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\neconomic unit, Sir, but I do not think that the man-in-the-street believe in it. The picture is  clear.\r\n\r\nI  am  sorry  to  have  to  quote  one  Legislative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncillor in the Federation Government who  asked,\r\n\r\n\"Why  should we lose $20 million a year by  selling\r\n\r\nFederation fish to let Singapore fishmongers make a\r\n\r\nprofit?\"  And  this Legislative Councillor  shouted\r\n\r\nloudly,  \"Why  should  we let  Singapore  pineapple\r\n\r\ncanners  benefit to the tune of millions of dollars\r\n\r\nby canning our pineapple?\" Sir, all these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings  should be sufficient for us  to  take  deep\r\n\r\nthoughts.

Members is the increase in the amount\r\n\r\nof  tax  on  chargeable incomes at  various  levels\r\n\r\nwhich  results from the new scale. Here again  this\r\n\r\ncan  best  be  seen  from the schedule+  which  was\r\n\r\nsupplied to hon. Members on the same day.  It  will\r\n\r\nbe   seen   from   the  schedule  that   chargeable\r\n\r\nincomes - that  is incomes after all allowances  have\r\n\r\nbeen deducted - of under $4,000 attract no additional\r\n\r\ntax.  At  $5,000 the increase is $20;  at  $10,000,\r\n\r\n$150;  at  $15,000,  $300;  at  $20,000,  $550;  at\r\n\r\n$25,000,  $800;  at  $30,000, $1,300;  at  $40,000,\r\n\r\n$2,550; and at $50,000, $3,800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another table++ which I think has been in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  hon. Members - if it has not been,  I  can\r\n\r\nsupply  them with copies - shows what is  called  the\r\n\r\neffective  rate  of  tax  at  the  new  rates.  The\r\n\r\neffective  rate of tax is the percentage which  the\r\n\r\ntax  which  a taxpayer actually pays bears  to  his\r\n\r\nassessable  income. These figures have  been  given\r\n\r\nfor  single men, married men, married men with  two\r\n\r\nof a family, but it should be noted that allowances\r\n\r\nother than personal and children's allowances  have\r\n\r\nbeen  excluded.  This table shows that  for  single\r\n\r\nmen,  the  effective rate of tax on  an  assessable\r\n\r\nincome  of $5,000 is 2.1 per cent; on $10,000,  5.9\r\n\r\nper  cent;  on $15,000, 9.4 per cent;  on  $20,000,\r\n\r\n12.3  per  cent;  on  $30,000, 16.8  per  cent;  on\r\n\r\n$40,000,  20.6 per cent; and on $50,000.  24.5  per\r\n\r\ncent.  I  would  like  Members  to  pay  particular\r\n\r\nattention  to these percentages.

That,  I  am  afraid,   is\r\n\r\ninevitable. Perhaps, I may be allowed to deal  once\r\n\r\nagain  with the points on which criticism has  been\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point of criticism - an old chestnut - is on\r\n\r\ngrounds of alleged evasion of tax. Critics will say\r\n\r\nwhy  raise the tax when so many people are  evading\r\n\r\ntax at present rates? Why not catch the evaders and\r\n\r\nobviate  the necessity for increasing rates?  Well,\r\n\r\nSir, the answer to that is that I think it safe  to\r\n\r\nsay that the amount of evasion which is alleged  to\r\n\r\ntake  place is exaggerated. This point has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  debated in the Assembly but perhaps I may  be\r\n\r\nallowed to go over the ground once more. I doubt if\r\n\r\nthere are many potential taxpayers in Singapore  of\r\n\r\nwhose  existence the Department is  not  aware  and\r\n\r\nwhose  cases  are not examined. No man registers  a\r\n\r\nmotor car without coming under the scrutiny of  the\r\n\r\nComptroller. No man hires a telephone  without  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing happening, and so on. We have very many\r\n\r\nsources  of  information about potential  taxpayers\r\n\r\nand  all  indications and suggestions are  followed\r\n\r\nup.  At  present, the Department has the  names  of\r\n\r\nsome  160,000  persons registered  on  its  records\r\n\r\nwhile  about  25,000 fresh cases are examined  each\r\n\r\nyear.   I  do  not  think  that  many  escape   the\r\n\r\nattentions  of the Comptroller. I do not  say  that\r\n\r\nevasion does not go on. That is inevitable  in  any\r\n\r\ncountry. But it is not nearly as widespread  as  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  believed by those who do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nfull  facts,  and  I  know that the  Department  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more and more expert in dealing with  it.\r\n\r\nMany  large-scale evaders have already been brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  book and at the present time there are over 200\r\n\r\ncases  being  subjected to detailed  investigation,\r\n\r\nbut  due  to the absence of publicity arising  from\r\n\r\nthe  secrecy provisions of the Ordinance, the  true\r\n\r\nnature and extent of this aspect of the work cannot\r\n\r\nbe   generally  appreciated.  In  short,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncriticism  that  increases  in  tax  would  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary if the Department did ifs job properly is\r\n\r\nsimply not justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism has been that the new rates of\r\n\r\ntax  will  discourage local investment.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  this will be the case.  In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace, the increases are not sufficiently great  to\r\n\r\nmake much difference to the actual amount available\r\n\r\nfor  investment. The increases can have very little\r\n\r\neffect  on the question of yield and all the  other\r\n\r\nfactors that investment capital takes into account.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I should have much more sympathy with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nargument if in fact the money had been invested  in\r\n\r\nthe  past. But it has not. It has been salted  away\r\n\r\nin different directions. If it is not going to come\r\n\r\nforward  voluntarily  in  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\nterritory in which it is made, a little more of  it\r\n\r\nmust be extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism will be that it is unwise for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  go ahead alone without corresponding\r\n\r\naction in the Federation. The argument here will be\r\n\r\nthat independent action may disrupt the Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\napproach to income tax and that the different rates\r\n\r\nmay  cause  taxpayers  to  change  their  place  of\r\n\r\nresidence. Superficially these arguments might have\r\n\r\nsome  force.  In  fact, however, they  have  little\r\n\r\nvalidity. There is, as I see it, little danger that\r\n\r\nindependent  action in this sphere will  jeopardise\r\n\r\nthe Pan-Malayan administration of income tax. There\r\n\r\nmight  have been some danger of this in  the  past.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do  not think that danger exists  now.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation Government appreciates that our need for\r\n\r\nrevenue,  arising  from  a desire  to  balance  our\r\n\r\nbudget,  necessitates a move which it is unable  to\r\n\r\ntake  at the present time. It will stand to benefit\r\n\r\nfrom our action to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think it unlikely that the increase in\r\n\r\nrates  is sufficiently great to cause taxpayers  to\r\n\r\nchange  residence. A change of residence is  not  a\r\n\r\nmove  which  one  makes  lightly  or  without  full\r\n\r\nconsideration  of the consequences and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the larger taxpayers who might be tempted  to\r\n\r\nconsider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  a  move  are sufficiently men of  affairs  to\r\n\r\nponder  the  wisdom of incurring  expense  on  what\r\n\r\nmight  conceivably be a costly move to no  purpose.\r\n\r\nWith  rare exceptions, the place of an individual's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresidence is largely determined by the locality  of\r\n\r\nhis  employment or the headquarters of his business\r\n\r\nand I am confident that it would take far more than\r\n\r\na  minor increase in taxation to influence  him  to\r\n\r\nchange it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, questions may be asked why we have not\r\n\r\nreduced personal allowances in order to broaden the\r\n\r\nbase of the income tax pyramid. Now that, Sir, is a\r\n\r\nmatter in which I am particularly interested. If  I\r\n\r\nmay express a personal opinion, that is, an opinion\r\n\r\nbased  purely  on  a slight knowledge  of  taxation\r\n\r\nmatters, budgetary policy, and of the difficulty of\r\n\r\nbalancing the budget, and without reference to  any\r\n\r\n`political  consideration, I should  say  that  the\r\n\r\nbase  of the tax pyramid must be broadened and more\r\n\r\npeople  brought within the scope of income  tax  by\r\n\r\nlowering  the personal allowances. In  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot much longer afford the luxury  of\r\n\r\nhaving  personal  reliefs  which  are  amongst  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in  the world and rates of tax  which  are\r\n\r\namongst the lowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a\r\n\r\nBill  and a motion on this subject today.

I  would  like  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  use  his  good  offices   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and plead with them, as he has\r\n\r\nso  very  often  pleaded with  them,  to  level  up\r\n\r\ntaxation policies. I would suggest that if he  were\r\n\r\nnot  influential enough, the Secretary of State for\r\n\r\nthe  Colonies might be brought in and persuaded  to\r\n\r\nact as an umpire to help us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1954 Singapore was on top of the world. The\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya then said, \"Why should  we  be\r\n\r\nseparated  from Singapore? We want to be together.\"\r\n\r\nToday  I  regret it is a different  story.  We  are\r\n\r\nasking  the Federation, \"Can we join you?\" What  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason for all this? I can say that  there  is\r\n\r\nonly  one  reason -  that  Singapore  has  not  been\r\n\r\nsetting  an  example  in the matter  of  peace  and\r\n\r\nstability for the country. Extremist elements  have\r\n\r\ncome  in  to destroy our stability and precipitated\r\n\r\nactions  which  are prejudicial and detrimental  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. I would like the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\ntake note that this is their country and if we want\r\n\r\nour  country to be always on top and always in  the\r\n\r\nlead, then we must have responsible leaders to help\r\n\r\nus  out. Leaders of the past whose names have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  into this Assembly, have been  branded  as\r\n\r\nnot having done good to the people, but I would say\r\n\r\nthat they did keep Singapore in the forefront.

Hart):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave His Excellency's authority to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection 11 of the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 160 of\r\n\r\nthe  Revised  Edition), resolves that  the  Customs\r\n\r\n(Duties)  (Amendment No. 2) Order, 1958,  published\r\n\r\nas Notification No. S 300 in Gazette Supplement No.\r\n\r\n83 of 3rd December, 1958, as contained in Sessional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper No S.L. 42 of 1958, be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this motion is to seek the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the Assembly for the changes  in  the\r\n\r\ntobacco tariff which were introduced on the 3rd  of\r\n\r\nDecember   and  which  are  contained  in   Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification No. S 300 of 3rd December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the tobacco tariff are briefly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) reversion to the original method of calculation of duty by weight;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the introduction of a \"step\" in the tariff for imported cigarettes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an increase in the duty on imported cigarettes above the \"step\", and on all\r\n\r\nbrands   of   imported  pipe   tobacco,   to Federation levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  reasons why these changes have been introduced\r\n\r\nare briefly as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the change in the method of calculation\r\n\r\nof  duty  on  imported cigarettes and pipe  tobacco\r\n\r\nwhich  was  introduced  in  October  did  not  work\r\n\r\nparticularly  well in practice. It led  to  certain\r\n\r\nanomalies  which were undesirable and  contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe  long-term fiscal objectives of Government. For\r\n\r\nexample,  it  led  to  certain  popular  brands  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  in  tins  costing more  than  the  same\r\n\r\ncigarettes  in packets with a consequential  switch\r\n\r\nin  consumer preference and a corresponding  effect\r\n\r\nin  yield of duty. Again, it led to certain  brands\r\n\r\nof cigarettes costing more in Singapore than in the\r\n\r\nFederation,  which was contrary to  the  policy  of\r\n\r\nGovernment in the matter. Yet again, the yield from\r\n\r\nthe  measures introduced in October promised to  be\r\n\r\ndisappointingly  small. In all  the  circumstances,\r\n\r\nafter  very  careful thought,  it  was  decided  to\r\n\r\nabandon  the  scheme introduced in October  and  to\r\n\r\nrevert to the method of calculation on weight alone\r\n\r\nwhich  had been used for very many years both  here\r\n\r\nand in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government has been considering for\r\n\r\nsome  time  the possibility of differentiating,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  duty  and consequently of retail  price,\r\n\r\nbetween the two main groups of imported cigarettes,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  popular  brands  of  cigarettes  like\r\n\r\nCapstan, Players, Gold Flake, Churchman, and so on,\r\n\r\nand the cheaper brands like Rough Rider, Double Ace\r\n\r\nand  Torchlight.  The  object  is  to  extract  the\r\n\r\nmaximum amount of revenue from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe tobacco tariff and at the same time to continue\r\n\r\nto   provide   a  satisfactory  type  of   imported\r\n\r\ncigarette for those who cannot afford the increased\r\n\r\ncost  of  the more popular brands. It has therefore\r\n\r\nbeen decided to make a \"step\" in the tobacco tariff\r\n\r\nbetween imported cigarettes weighing less than 2.32\r\n\r\nlbs, per  mille and cigarettes weighing more  than\r\n\r\n2.32  lbs, per  mille.  The former  category  will\r\n\r\nconsist   of  the  Double  Ace,  Rough  Rider   and\r\n\r\nTorchlight brands and the duty will remain  at  the\r\n\r\nexisting  level of $8.60 a pound full and  $8.10  a\r\n\r\npound   preferential.  The  latter  category   will\r\n\r\nconsist  of all other imported cigarettes  and  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  duty will be raised to Federation levels,\r\n\r\nnamely  $10.50  a  pound  full  and  $10  a   pound\r\n\r\npreferential. And since we do not at this  juncture\r\n\r\nintend to increase the duty on cut tobacco imported\r\n\r\nfor   the   local  manufacture  of  cigarettes   by\r\n\r\nmechanical  means, there will also be yet  a  third\r\n\r\ncategory of cigarettes which will retail at  prices\r\n\r\nsubstantially  below the Rough Rider  category.  In\r\n\r\nshort,  by  introducing a \"step\"  in  the  imported\r\n\r\ncigarette duty tariff, we are providing three broad\r\n\r\ncategories  of good quality cigarettes and  meeting\r\n\r\nthe needs of all purses of all in-come categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in duty has been dictated by an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  for  revenue.  It  should  not  cause\r\n\r\nhardship.  It has been maintained in the Federation\r\n\r\nfor a number of years without causing hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of these changes in tariff will have\r\n\r\nbeen seen from the revised price lists published in\r\n\r\nthe  Press  by the main distributors.  The  general\r\n\r\neffect   is  that,  while  the  prices  of  locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured cigarettes and imported cigarettes  of\r\n\r\nthe   Double  Ace  category  remain  at  pre-budget\r\n\r\nlevels,  the  prices  of cigarettes  like  Players,\r\n\r\nCapstan,  Gold Flake, etc., which make  up  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge proportion of local consumption, go up  by  5\r\n\r\ncents for 10. At the same time, as a result of  the\r\n\r\nremoval of the element of duty calculated on c.i.f.\r\n\r\nprice,  the  price  of some of the  more  expensive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrands  of  cigarettes which had as a result  risen\r\n\r\nabove the price current in the Federation, has  now\r\n\r\nbeen lowered to the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that these increases in duty will\r\n\r\nyield rather more than $5.5 million in a full year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, certain dangers inherent in\r\n\r\nthe  creation of a \"step\". It creates a  margin  of\r\n\r\nprice  advantage of which those concerned with  the\r\n\r\nmarketing  of the cheaper brands might possibly  be\r\n\r\ntempted  to  take advantage. It is sincerely  hoped\r\n\r\nthat they will not yield to this temptation because\r\n\r\nthe  Government would be most unwilling to have its\r\n\r\nplans   for  the  benefit  of  the  general  public\r\n\r\nfrustrated by selfish interests, and I am sure that\r\n\r\nit  would  be  prepared to take drastic  action  to\r\n\r\nensure that this was not done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the question of smuggling.\r\n\r\nSmuggling has always existed and will always  exist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  long as the Rhio islands are part of the  trade\r\n\r\narea  of  Singapore;  as  long  as  re-exports  are\r\n\r\nallowed  freely;  and as long as  tobacco  duty  is\r\n\r\nlevied  in Singapore. It is only natural  that  any\r\n\r\nincrease  in duty in Singapore should increase  the\r\n\r\nincentive to smuggle and it is only to be  expected\r\n\r\nthat  the  increases now introduced  will  lead  to\r\n\r\nincreased activity on the part of the smugglers. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  the  Preventive  Branch  of  the\r\n\r\nCustoms  Department is now better equipped than  it\r\n\r\nhas ever been before to deal with this nuisance and\r\n\r\nI  think  it safe to say that all those people  who\r\n\r\nsee  in the increase in tobacco duty an opportunity\r\n\r\nto line their pockets by smuggling will be in for a\r\n\r\nvery hard time. But there is another aspect of  the\r\n\r\nmatter. Before the cigarettes can be smuggled  back\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, they have to be despatched  to  Rhio\r\n\r\nand  we  now have a deplorable situation  in  which\r\n\r\ncertain  firms,  while gladly  accepting  all  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has to offer in the way of a secure  base\r\n\r\nfor  their business activities, seem quite prepared\r\n\r\nto  stab her in the back by exporting cigarettes to\r\n\r\nRhio  regardless of the possibility  that  a  large\r\n\r\npercentage of their exports will in due  course  be\r\n\r\nsmuggled  back.  I think that the time  is  rapidly\r\n\r\napproaching  when  drastic  action  must  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst this short-sighted trading practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2)\r\n\r\nof  section  11 of the Customs Ordinance  (Chapter\r\n\r\n160  of  the Revised Edition), resolves  that  the\r\n\r\nCustoms  (Duties) (Amendment No. 2)  Order.  1958,\r\n\r\npublished  as  Notification No. S 300  in  Gazette\r\n\r\nSupplement No. 83 of 3rd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember,  1958, as contained in Sessional  Paper\r\n\r\nNo. S.L. 42 of 1958, be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now\r\n\r\nadjourn.\"-[Mr J.
