I was not in the  House  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister  questioned my message on foreign talent.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nwas  surprised that the Minister chose to misinterpret  my  call\r\n\r\nfor  the  toning down of the foreign talent message, as  a  call\r\n\r\nagainst foreign talent.  I think this is not fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always subscribed to the open system of recruiting\r\n\r\nthe  best  into our service.  And where there are  gaps  in  our\r\n\r\nrecruitment exercise, we should allow foreign talent to come and\r\n\r\nfill those gaps.  But I said that in this crisis, charity begins\r\n\r\nat  home.  Did I ask that we should stop them from coming?   No.\r\n\r\nDid  I  ask  that  we sack them and replace the  vacancies  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?   No.  All that I asked is for the  Government  to\r\n\r\nplay down this message in this crisis.  Is that wrong?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wrong, Sir, for me to ask that Singaporeans should\r\n\r\ntake  priority in the Government's plans to tackle the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis?

Yesterday, a number of MPs spoke\r\n\r\nabout  the  importance of the knowledge economy to Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe next century.  This is a crucial area and we should be clear\r\n\r\nabout  what  we  are  referring to.  We are  not  talking  about\r\n\r\nparticular  industries or particular companies.   The  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy is not an add-on.  What we are talking about is a  total\r\n\r\nnational  orientation towards brain work, as opposed  to  manual\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take the example of Internet and e-commerce. A few\r\n\r\nnights  ago, the US Ambassador in Singapore invited me to dinner\r\n\r\nto  meet Raymond Lane, the President and Chief Operating Officer\r\n\r\nof  Oracle.   Oracle is a software company whose  capitalisation\r\n\r\nhas  now  overtaken  General Motors, the  world's  biggest  auto\r\n\r\ncompany.   Raymond  Lane said that in the next  five  years,  e-commerce  will  cause  a  major change in global  manufacturing,\r\n\r\ndistribution  and consumption.  He thinks that  the  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe next five years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  as great as the changes that have taken place  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  60  years.   I do not know whether he is right  or  he  is\r\n\r\nwrong, but even if he is out by five years, I think the point is\r\n\r\nvery  clear.   Unless we gear ourselves for that new  world,  we\r\n\r\nwill be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same dinner, the US Ambassador cited some statistics\r\n\r\nwhich I thought were very interesting.  America On-Line has also\r\n\r\nsurpassed General Motors in capitalisation.  Amazon.com  already\r\n\r\nhas  a capitalisation greater than that of Boeing Aircraft.  One\r\n\r\nproduces 777s and the most advanced aeroplanes in the world  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  sells  books, which he does not own.   Microsoft,  a\r\n\r\ngiant,  has a capitalisation greater than that of all the  stock\r\n\r\nmarkets of the South East Asian countries combined.  And  little\r\n\r\nYahoo  has  a  capitalisation greater than that of  the  Jakarta\r\n\r\nstock exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether some of these valuations are exaggerated\r\n\r\nor  whether  they reflect underlying realities,  but  these  are\r\n\r\nfacts.   And  we have got to ask ourselves what is happening  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   Why  is it, when we study Fortune  500  companies,\r\n\r\nthere  is  such a drastic shift, away from those who dig  things\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ground, who bend metals, who do repetitive  work,  to\r\n\r\nthose which produce creative outputs from the human brain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the balance sheets of AOL or Microsoft, we are\r\n\r\nhard  put to figure out what their assets are, because it is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  machines,  factories or land.  It  is  human  knowledge,\r\n\r\nhuman network, the culture of a company. When you acquire such a\r\n\r\ncompany,  you  ascribe  the difference  to  goodwill.   So  even\r\n\r\ngeneral accounting principles have not quite caught up with  the\r\n\r\nknowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore crucial that despite the Asian crisis, we keep\r\n\r\nour  eyes  on  what is coming on the horizon.  Internet  and  e-commerce  will shake every industry to its foundations,  and  it\r\n\r\naffects all sectors.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen was absolutely right.  It\r\n\r\nis not just computers and IT.  He talked about Viagra, and asked\r\n\r\nrather mischievously whether it is part of the knowledge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.  Well, Viagra is a very interesting drug.  It works the\r\n\r\nsame  way  that nitroglycerine works when you put it  under  the\r\n\r\ntongue  for heart patients.  Recently, Nobel prizes were awarded\r\n\r\nto  the  scientists  who  discovered the biochemistry  of  these\r\n\r\ndrugs.   These  are  extremely  knowledge-intensive  industries,\r\n\r\nwhich we should become a part of.  What Zantac, which is an anti-ulcer drug, has done for Glaxo, Viagra will do for Pfizer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of trade have changed. If we are just drawers of\r\n\r\nwater  and hewers of wood, machines will take over our work  and\r\n\r\nwe will draw only a pittance.  The key is working with the human\r\n\r\nbrain,  which  means  educating  the  young,  teaching  them  to\r\n\r\nnetwork,  not  just  within Singapore but in  the  whole  world,\r\n\r\nunderstanding  where the value added is the greatest,  and  then\r\n\r\ngetting the maximum return from the effort that we put in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone can be a high-tech hot shot, but we must\r\n\r\nhave  a  significant high-tech sector in Singapore  to  pull  us\r\n\r\nalong.   And  a  knowledge economy applies as  much  to  mundane\r\n\r\nthings  like  clothing  and food.  When I  go  jogging,  I  wear\r\n\r\nChinese singlets which cost me $3.  If you buy Calvin Klein,  it\r\n\r\nmay cost you 10-20 times the amount, but it is real value Calvin\r\n\r\nKlein  has  added, which the Chinese have not quite  understood.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Bodyknits  understands this  with  their  range  of\r\n\r\nproducts  and  they  are now trying to break into  the  American\r\n\r\nmarket.   Our  poh piah king has recently launched  frozen  roti\r\n\r\nprata, and I am told by Singaporeans in Germany that if you  put\r\n\r\nthem  in  a  toaster, they come out as good as Jalan  Kayu  roti\r\n\r\nprata.   Maybe  Germany is cold and it is  far  away,  but  that\r\n\r\nreally  caught  my  attention.  This is part  of  the  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy, how you turn an existing product and add value  to  it,\r\n\r\nenlarge your market and make profits from it, creating jobs  and\r\n\r\nemployment  for Singaporeans. The key for us is a  new  kind  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Rai talked about the Marwaris in India. The\r\n\r\nMarwaris  are  a  small tribe from Rajasthan who are  incredibly\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.  If you look at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Indian stock market, they own many of the companies  there.\r\n\r\nIn  Calcutta, the Bengalis are great poets, writers,  musicians,\r\n\r\nbut the industrialists are almost all Marwaris.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is in the culture of a people. I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that you can easily teach it.  I think you either  have\r\n\r\nit  as  a  culture or you do not have it as a  culture.   And  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   that   we  have  it  as  a  people,  because   without\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  in  Singapore,  the  entrepreneurship  of  our\r\n\r\nforefathers,  the  entrepreneurship in the  public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors in Singapore, there would not be the Singapore of today.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  need to do is to learn a new kind of entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nwhich is an entrepreneurship which is not evident on the balance\r\n\r\nsheet, not things you can see and touch, not real estate  -  and\r\n\r\nour  people  are big real estate entrepreneurs  -  not  just  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  all  over South East Asia, Australia,  even  in\r\n\r\nEurope  and  America  -  but in high-tech, where we are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  intangibles, and that requires a new set of skills, a  new\r\n\r\nset  of  rules  and regulations, maybe new laws,  new  kinds  of\r\n\r\nfinancing.   And  this  is precisely what the  Technopreneurship\r\n\r\nCommittee,  chaired by Dr Tony Tan, is trying to  do.   We  have\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, but we must migrate it progressively  so  that\r\n\r\nour  younger  people will be able to deal and  have  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge in different industries and products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about venture capital. The issue is not money. That\r\n\r\nare  lots  of money in Singapore.  Venture money is  not  stupid\r\n\r\nmoney, which you throw at things or projects.  Venture money  is\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  smartest money around.  They are making  bets  on\r\n\r\nindividuals,  on companies, on market trends.   To  build  up  a\r\n\r\nventure capital financial market in Singapore will take us  many\r\n\r\nyears.   We  are getting consultants to help us.  We  have  many\r\n\r\nadvisers from Silicon Valley and from elsewhere, but this  is  a\r\n\r\nnew  area for us.  Our banks have got to get used to it,  credit\r\n\r\nofficers  have got to get used to it.  Eventually, we  will  get\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must show to high-tech players in the world that we are fully\r\n\r\ncommitted to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  area and we also intend to be a player in this  area.   We\r\n\r\nwill  do  everything which is necessary, building up the science\r\n\r\npark,  incubator units, one-stop centres, the whole  list  which\r\n\r\nmany MPs have talked about and which we will seriously consider.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  end,  what we need is a solid national  commitment\r\n\r\ninvolving  both  the  public  and private  sectors,  the  school\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  universities, a keen determination, a strong  will\r\n\r\npower,  to  get there, to transfer our value added  increasingly\r\n\r\nfrom  repetitive work to brain work, whether this be in the life\r\n\r\nsciences,  in  computers, in fashion,  in  food,  in  trade,  in\r\n\r\nlogistics,  in whatever.  It is not something which is  abstract\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.  It is something which all of us can do in our\r\n\r\nown  little  circle.   And if we can achieve  that,  change  the\r\n\r\nculture of Singapore, then we will succeed.  We have no choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh said yesterday, he thought of migrating to\r\n\r\nAmerica, and many of his friends have done so, because they have\r\n\r\nthis  glint  in their eyes that there is a prospect of  becoming\r\n\r\nwealthy in a short period of time, and they have left.  If we do\r\n\r\nnot  have this sector in Singapore and develop technopreneurship\r\n\r\nin Singapore, and show commitment to it in the way we adjust our\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations, my fear is our own best  and  brightest\r\n\r\nwill  leave, not to talk about the foreigners that we would  not\r\n\r\nbe able to attract into Singapore, and our most enterprising and\r\n\r\ncreative may find greener pastures elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time is short, I think I should end here and give the rest of\r\n\r\nthe time to my colleague, Mr Tang Guan Seng.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng):</b> Sir, I will reply to some of the\r\n\r\npoints  raised by MPs yesterday.  Mr Inderjit Singh and  Dr  Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat made some comments on our attractions on Sentosa.   Dr\r\n\r\nToh  said that the Merlion Tower is fiction.  But I think  there\r\n\r\nis nothing wrong in it.  The Merlion symbol was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncreated  more than 30 years ago by the Tourism Promotion  Board.\r\n\r\nIt  has become a globally recognised tourist icon for Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen  tourists come to Singapore, they like to take  photographs\r\n\r\nwith   the   Merlion.   Because  of  this,  Sentosa  Development\r\n\r\nCorporation (SDC) built the Merlion Tower.  Since its completion\r\n\r\nin  1996,  about  half a million tourists visited  this  Merlion\r\n\r\nevery year.  We must thank the Merlion which has contributed  to\r\n\r\nthe tourism industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentosa is our top attraction. Despite the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  and  the  drop  in  tourist  arrivals,  last  year  it\r\n\r\nattracted  3.3  million tourists.  So credit  must  go  to  SDC.\r\n\r\nThere are many attractions on Sentosa.  Some are privately owned\r\n\r\nand  some  are  owned by SDC.  SDC is constantly  reviewing  and\r\n\r\nrenewing its attractions on Sentosa.   For example, Siloso Beach\r\n\r\nhas  become  a  major  attraction now.  The Musical  Foundation,\r\n\r\nwhich  changes its shows regularly to attract visitors, and  the\r\n\r\nImages of Singapore are also popular with tourists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private attractions on Sentosa, they have their\r\n\r\nown  product life cycle.  SDC is encouraging them to  renew  the\r\n\r\nattractions  and put in new investments by offering  incentives.\r\n\r\nIf they apply, SDC will consider them favourably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing incentives, SDC is also implementing\r\n\r\nvarious  measures to attract visitors to Sentosa.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Mega Savers Scheme is quite successful.  As stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  yesterday,  we are going to do a strategic  review  of\r\n\r\nSentosa to reposition it as a world class tourist attraction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also commented on the performance of our\r\n\r\ntourism  sector.   Last  year, there was a  decline  in  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals  by  12%.   Because of this, STB has stepped  up  their\r\n\r\npromotion  efforts.   There is a $30 million marketing  campaign\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Once in a Millennium Offer\".  This will run  from  June\r\n\r\nthis  year  to August next year and there will be  a  series  of\r\n\r\nactivities and events to attract visitors to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as visa procedures are concerned, STB is working\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the Ministry of Home Affairs.  In  fact,  leisure\r\n\r\ngroups from China can now apply for double-entry visas.  As  for\r\n\r\ngroup  tourists from China, it is easier now for them  to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  visas.   For  tourists from India, Myanmar and  Blangadesh,\r\n\r\nthey can now apply for a 2-year or 5-year multiple journey visas\r\n\r\nif   they  are  businessmen  or  staff  of  the  tourism-related\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STB is also considering the possibility of developing sports\r\n\r\ntourism.  STB is trying to anchor strategic world-class sporting\r\n\r\nevents  in  Singapore.  It  will explore  financial  and  fiscal\r\n\r\nincentives to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Rai that we should capitalise on our multi-cultural richness. One example is the Chinatown project. We\r\n\r\nwill  do  more in this area so that we can attract  tourists  to\r\n\r\nstay in Singapore a little longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies in the tourism industry which want to upgrade and\r\n\r\nimprove  their services, they can, in fact, apply for incentives\r\n\r\nunder the Tourism Development Assistance Scheme.  This year  STB\r\n\r\nhas  projected that tourist arrivals to Singapore will  increase\r\n\r\nby 1% to 3%.  We have to put in more efforts in order to achieve\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok and Dr Toh See Kiat brought up cases involving\r\n\r\ntrading  of  soft commodities.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently only rubber and\r\n\r\ncoffee  futures  are  gazetted under the Commodity  Futures  Act\r\n\r\n(CFA).  My Ministry is considering whether extending the CFA  to\r\n\r\ncover  futures trading in other commodities will  help  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  \"bucket-shop\"  problem.  We are  also  examining  the\r\n\r\nregulatory regimes of other countries such as the US and  UK  to\r\n\r\nsee  if  they  work  and are appropriate for  us.   We  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscussing with the relevant Ministries and agencies on possible\r\n\r\napproaches to deal with this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say this is a very complicated subject. An important\r\n\r\nprinciple is that we should not over-regulate.  When we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulate, the regulations must be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No regulatory system can protect investors from fraud if they\r\n\r\nmake foolish decisions or enter into one-sided contracts without\r\n\r\ndue  diligence.   They should be discerning when  responding  to\r\n\r\nadvertising claims and stay away from dubious investment schemes\r\n\r\nthat  promise unrealistically high returns.  They must  be  more\r\n\r\nvigilant   when   contemplating   unfamiliar   and   risky   new\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Toh See Kiat also raised the issue of retail price\r\n\r\nmaintenance.   My  Ministry replied to a similar  question  some\r\n\r\ntime  ago  and the position remains unchanged. The best  way  to\r\n\r\nprevent price fixing behaviour is to promote competition in  the\r\n\r\nmarket  place, and to maintain a free and open economy  so  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  barriers to the flow of  goods  in  and  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This allows retailers, producers and  consumers  to\r\n\r\nbuy  from all sources at the most competitive prices, even  from\r\n\r\nabroad.   Retailers who face pressure from their usual suppliers\r\n\r\nto  sell  their goods at set prices can, and should, source  for\r\n\r\nalternative suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry administers the Price Control Act. If necessary, we\r\n\r\ncan  use this Act to deal with the problem.  Meanwhile,  we  are\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the  situation closely.  We are  also  studying  the\r\n\r\nexperiences of other countries in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo is concerned over the presence of toxic chemicals in\r\n\r\ntoys.   There  were  also  reports in the newspapers  expressing\r\n\r\nsimilar  concerns.   In  view  of  this,  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  recently  has  made analysis  on  some  samples  of\r\n\r\nTeletubby toys and infant feeding devices and found the  results\r\n\r\nto  be  satisfactory.  There were no phthalates  detected.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Environment said that they would  continue  to\r\n\r\nmake checks whenever they receive reports of toxic substances in\r\n\r\ntoys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that we are monitoring this\r\n\r\nclosely.    Should  there  be  an  assessment  that  there   are\r\n\r\nsubstances in toys or other products that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrender  them  unsafe for the public, the Government  would  take\r\n\r\nnecessary  actions.   It  is not necessary  to  set  up  another\r\n\r\nregulatory body just for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has commented on our efforts to attract world\r\n\r\nclass exhibitions and conferences to Singapore.  We have managed\r\n\r\nto  achieve  quite  a  lot  in this  area.   For  example,  mega\r\n\r\nexhibitions  like  Asian  Aerospace, Food  and  Hotel  Asia  and\r\n\r\nCommunic Asia have come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of infrastructure and exhibition space, we have enough\r\n\r\nto  cater  to  our needs.  With the completion of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nExpo  which provides 60,000 sq metres of space, we are  able  to\r\n\r\naccommodate world-class events.  If there is a need, we can  add\r\n\r\nanother 40,000 sq metres to a site nearer to the Singapore Expo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has urged the Government to use more recycled\r\n\r\nwater  and sea water.  We are doing this.  For example, we  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  industries and encourage  them  to  use  recycled\r\n\r\nwater.   Industries  like  electronics  and  electroplating  use\r\n\r\nrecycled  water.  For example, wafer fabrication plants  recycle\r\n\r\ntheir  water up to 50% per day, which is equivalent to the  size\r\n\r\nof 11 swimming pools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sea water, I can inform the Member that those industries\r\n\r\nlocated  near the seafront such as power stations and refineries\r\n\r\nare using sea water.   In fact, the volume of sea water they use\r\n\r\neveryday  can  fill  five  MacRitchie reservoirs.   So  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  a  lot  in  this area and we are trying  to  encourage\r\n\r\nindustries to use more sea water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng touched on the subject of\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency.  I must inform the House that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  implemented  various  incentive schemes  to  encourage  our\r\n\r\ncompanies and industries to use energy more efficiently.  On the\r\n\r\npart of PUB, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconducts  regular  energy audits and it also organises  seminars\r\n\r\nand workshops so that the latest information can be disseminated\r\n\r\nto  the industries and companies.  Singapore Power, in fact,  is\r\n\r\nalso  very  keen to promote energy efficiency.  For example,  it\r\n\r\nreceives  students from schools to their power  plants  so  that\r\n\r\nthey know how important it is to use energy efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, would you like to withdraw your amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I thank both the Minister and the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary for their very comprehensive replies.

Another  worrying\r\n\r\ntrend is that juvenile crime is also on the rise.  Although  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Police has taken pains to explain that the rise\r\n\r\nin  crime is no cause for alarm, rising crime is always a  cause\r\n\r\nfor concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising crime statistics, especially when Singapore is\r\n\r\nperceived  to be relatively crime free, always unsettle  people.\r\n\r\nOur crime free and disciplined society is very often touted as a\r\n\r\nvery  strong plus point for foreign investors and visitors.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  likely that we shall lose this overnight, but  over  an\r\n\r\nextended  period, if the trend continues, we may just lose  this\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge.   We just cannot afford  to  lose  this  plus\r\n\r\nfactor, especially one that I feel is within our control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several reasons were advanced for the increase in crime\r\n\r\nrates  ranging  from the economic slowdown to  the  presence  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers and illegal immigrants.  The increase in  crime\r\n\r\ncoincided with the advent of the economic crisis.  It appears to\r\n\r\nbe a given that during tough economic conditions, more resort to\r\n\r\ncrime.   I wonder if this is true of disciplined societies  like\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea.  Will an ordinarily law abiding citizen resort  to\r\n\r\ncrime  when that person loses a job?  If these offenders  resort\r\n\r\nto crime because they cannot make ends meet and not because they\r\n\r\nare  greedy  or bad per se, this is indeed a sign  of  desperate\r\n\r\ntimes.  Perhaps we must do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore to help these people cope with their hardships, which is  a\r\n\r\nperfectly good crime preventive measure.  With retrenchments  on\r\n\r\nthe  rise  this  year,  it must mean that our  crime  rate  will\r\n\r\nworsen.   Something  has  to be done to  arrest  the  situation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister will like to highlight to the House how the\r\n\r\nHome Team is planning to cope with the worsening situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the reasons advanced for the declining crime\r\n\r\nsituation,  a  rise in crime rate may indicate that insufficient\r\n\r\nfocus  was  placed  on  policing  activities  due  to  declining\r\n\r\nmanpower  or  manpower  cuts.  As part of our  restructuring  in\r\n\r\nmaking   our  police  officers  more  effective  and  justifying\r\n\r\nreducing  our manpower needs, one must wonder if the setting  up\r\n\r\nof   the  NPCs  has  resulted  in  the  lower  presence  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  policemen.  It could be  due  to  the  change  in\r\n\r\npolicing  that has given criminals a wrong signal and encouraged\r\n\r\nthem to try their luck now that less policemen are patrolling by\r\n\r\nfoot or on bicycles.  It is an undeniable fact that the presence\r\n\r\nof the police does deter crime just as the presence of a traffic\r\n\r\npolice officer would deter speeding.  I raised this concern  two\r\n\r\nyears ago on the structural changes in our policing methods  and\r\n\r\na  drop in police presence.  Could the Minister please enlighten\r\n\r\nus  on  whether  the crime rates in areas that  previously  have\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  police posts have increased after the  NPPs  were\r\n\r\nclosed, and is there any drop in the number of crime reports  in\r\n\r\nareas after the NPCs were set up?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also worried by the apparent increase in crimes\r\n\r\nbeing  committed by teenagers and youths, especially those  that\r\n\r\nresulted  in injury during robbery attempts.  We have just  been\r\n\r\nconfronted by the most recent case of murder allegedly committed\r\n\r\nby  three young children.  Our young criminals appear to be much\r\n\r\nyounger,  more  fearless and increasingly  more  violent.   What\r\n\r\ncould  possibly have happened that have caused them to be beyond\r\n\r\nparental control?  Will the Minister highlight to this House the\r\n\r\nefficacy of his Ministry's efforts in working\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  other Ministries on crime prevention work amongst students\r\n\r\nand the youths that have dropped out of schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, youth offenders under 16 cannot be named to\r\n\r\nprotect  their  identity.  With widespread public education  and\r\n\r\naccess  to  media  anti-crime messages, I am not  sure  if  this\r\n\r\nshould  be changed.  Are these youths or the masterminds  behind\r\n\r\nthem making use of this legal loophole to persuade our young  to\r\n\r\ncommit  crimes  because  even  if  they  should  be  caught   or\r\n\r\napprehended, they can hide behind the mask given to them by  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   It  is indeed a contradiction in terms to want to protect\r\n\r\nthem  after they have committed hideous crimes that children  of\r\n\r\ntheir  age  should  not have done.  Moreover, parents  of  these\r\n\r\noffenders  may  not  realise or feel the  seriousness  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren's  criminal acts because they have  not  been  publicly\r\n\r\nshamed   by  the  disclosure  of  their  children's   names   or\r\n\r\nphotographs.  As such, it will be a better deterrent if this law\r\n\r\nof  not  naming  offenders under 16 years old  be  repealed  and\r\n\r\nparents be made responsible as well for their children's crimes.\r\n\r\nI seek the Minister's views on whether he will consider a repeal\r\n\r\nof this law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  this opportunity to urge the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs   to  conduct  open-house  sessions  for  teenagers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  visit  the prisons and feel  for  themselves  the\r\n\r\nmisery of lives behind bars, to serve as a deterrent to  teenage\r\n\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of teenage crime is something which is of great\r\n\r\nconcern   to  our  people.   According  to  a  survey   on   the\r\n\r\npsychological  qualities  of  our  teenagers  today,   in  1996,\r\n\r\nteenagers nowadays are generally very emotional.  They live in a\r\n\r\nmaterialistically rich environment, and they  lack  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to  society.   This  is  unlike   their   older\r\n\r\ngenerations  where they worked very hard for the  society.   Our\r\n\r\nyoung  people are more egoistic.  They are asking for more  from\r\n\r\nthe  nation,  from  society and from the family.   They  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand what they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan do for the nation, for the society and for the family.  They\r\n\r\nonly ask what can the nation and society do for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of mentality is wrong. More importantly, they do\r\n\r\nnot have the courage and confidence to deal with failures.  With\r\n\r\njust a little setback, they will become very upset and start  to\r\n\r\nblame  others.  They blame the family members,  society and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but never themselves.  They even harbour the feeling\r\n\r\nthat  everybody has failed them, and they want to  get  back  on\r\n\r\nthem. Thus, they begin to develop an anti-social behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents nowadays do not know how to discipline their\r\n\r\nchildren.   They allow them all the liberty to do as they  wish.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, they are not properly guided.   They do not  have\r\n\r\nthe will power to resist what is wrong and would often yield  to\r\n\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to carry out\r\n\r\nmore   educational activities for the benefit of  our  teenagers\r\n\r\nand   steer  them  away from crime.  Therefore,  I  ask  MHA  to\r\n\r\nconsider  opening  the prisons, the drug rehabilitation  centres\r\n\r\nand  the detention homes for visits by young Singaporeans.   Let\r\n\r\nthe  secondary and primary students visit these places  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  could  understand what would be the consequences  if  they\r\n\r\nwere  to do something wrong or to commit a crime, with the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  these visits would have  some deterrent effects  on  them.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  we would also let our  students  know  how\r\n\r\neffective our Police is in solving all the crimes, to drive home\r\n\r\nthe message that \"Crime does not pay\"!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, despite heavy penalties that have\r\n\r\nbeen meted out by the courts on road bullies, recent reports  of\r\n\r\nthe  recurrence  of  road  bullying tactics  indicate  that  the\r\n\r\nproblem is still a very real and difficult one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road bullying seems to come in different forms, that of\r\n\r\nfinger gestures interpreted to be demeaning and degrading and an\r\n\r\ninsult  to  outright violence.  A finger gesture may  result  in\r\n\r\nlost honour and pride and the insulted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmotorist must avenge himself and a road chase begins.   We  have\r\n\r\nread  of  a taxi driver dying from a weak heart whilst  pursuing\r\n\r\nthe  motorist who had shown him a finger gesture.  I  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen told of one unreported incident, which I wish to relate  to\r\n\r\nthe  House.   A  driver  of  a Mercedes  Benz  car  was  driving\r\n\r\nleisurely on the road.  Along came a driver in an old Toyota who\r\n\r\nbeamed his headlights and then overtook him.  The Mercedes  Benz\r\n\r\ndriver  then picked up speed to chase the latter and caused  the\r\n\r\ndriver of the Toyota and his family to fear for their lives when\r\n\r\nthe  Mercedes  Benz  overtook the Toyota  and  the  driver  made\r\n\r\ndeliberate  stops  intermittently.   He  stopped  his  car  when\r\n\r\nsignalled  by  the Toyota driver to do so.  He sat  quietly  and\r\n\r\nrefused  to  respond to the other driver's angry questions.   He\r\n\r\nlet  the Toyota driver take off and then drove dangerously close\r\n\r\nto  him,  used his right side mirror to tear off the left  outer\r\n\r\nmirror  of the Toyota and then sped off.  This incident was  not\r\n\r\nreported  to the Police because the driver of the Toyota  feared\r\n\r\nretaliation.  One wonders how many such incidents go unreported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing legislation is insufficient to deal with these\r\n\r\nvarying  forms  of road bullying.  The penalties prescribed  for\r\n\r\ncausing  hurt  or  grievous hurt are not  deterrent  enough.   I\r\n\r\npropose  that separate and specific sections be created  in  the\r\n\r\nRoad Traffic Act with enhanced penalties to punish road bullying\r\n\r\nin  various  forms.   In the more aggravated  instance  of  road\r\n\r\nbullying  where  injury of life or property is caused  to  other\r\n\r\nroad  users, the vehicle should be confiscated.  We must  strike\r\n\r\nwhere  it  hurts most.  If confiscation of lorries  for  illegal\r\n\r\ndumping  of waste is permitted under the law, there are stronger\r\n\r\nreasons   to   confiscate  vehicles  involved  in   frightening,\r\n\r\njeopardising or injuring road users.  Just like sections in  the\r\n\r\nRoad  Traffic  Act on drunken driving and use of  handphones,  a\r\n\r\nclearly defined section on road bullying will give the Police  a\r\n\r\nmore effective law to deal with this problem.  A proper schedule\r\n\r\nof  offences  and  the  corresponding  penalties  will  be  more\r\n\r\neffective.   Stiffer  penalties for illegal parking  at  zig-zag\r\n\r\nlines, speeding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin excess of defined limits, use of handphones while driving and\r\n\r\ndrunken  driving have yielded much desired results in  arresting\r\n\r\nthe rise of these menaces.  It is a worthwhile and timely effort\r\n\r\nto  consider amending the Road Traffic Act to incorporate  these\r\n\r\nstiffer penalties to make our roads safer for our users.  I urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider a review of the law to stamp out  road\r\n\r\nbully offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the fact that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is considered one of the safest cities to  live  does\r\n\r\nnot happen by chance.  It is through the hard work and vision of\r\n\r\nthe  Home  Team,  especially our Police  Force,  who  constantly\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves and implement new initiatives to fight  crime\r\n\r\nand  ensure that our citizens are well protected and  our  homes\r\n\r\nand properties secure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major successes in the philosophy of our police work\r\n\r\nis  community policing.  The Ministry has scored a great success\r\n\r\nin  the  introduction  of  Neighbourhood  Police  Post  and  the\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood   Watch  programme.   The  introduction   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunity Focus Plan (CFP) has brought community policing to yet\r\n\r\nanother  dimension.  The primary objective of the CFP initiative\r\n\r\nis  to mobilise the community to play an active part in ensuring\r\n\r\ntheir  own safety and security.  The CFP has been initiated  for\r\n\r\nslightly  more than a year ago and already it has  enjoyed  some\r\n\r\nsuccesses.   One example is the problem Little India faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  weekend  congregation of foreign  workers  which  had  been\r\n\r\nresolved  with  the  combined  effort  of  the  Tanglin   Police\r\n\r\nDivision,  the Moulmein/Teck Kah Committee and the Moulmein/Teck\r\n\r\nKah CCC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, a seminar was organised by the Singapore Police\r\n\r\nForce  and the People's Association on Community Focus  Plan  in\r\n\r\nwhich the Police and the various grassroots leaders examine  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of the Community Focus Plan and see what is  the  next\r\n\r\nstep  to make the plan more effective.  Many aspects of the plan\r\n\r\nhave been discussed in detail.  Some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexamples  are  the  care  and support programme  for  offenders'\r\n\r\nfamilies,  schemes  extended to victims  of  serious  and  fatal\r\n\r\ntraffic accidents, juvenile delinquency, drug prevention,  civil\r\n\r\ndefence,  reintegrating of offenders and mediation of  disputes,\r\n\r\netc.  I understand that the seminar was a great success and many\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations  in  the various  constituencies  have\r\n\r\nactually  implemented some of these plans.   I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to give us a brief account of the progress  of\r\n\r\nthe CFP and what is going to be its future direction.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns from some of the grassroots leaders,\r\n\r\nironically,  is  because of the success of this plan,  they  are\r\n\r\nworried  that  some of the responsibilities of the Police  Force\r\n\r\nwill  be transferred to the CDC or the grassroots organisations.\r\n\r\nI  hope the Minister would give an assurance that this is  never\r\n\r\nthe intention and will never be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point is that although the CFP is well understood\r\n\r\nand  received  by the grassroots organisations,  the  public  at\r\n\r\nlarge  may  not be so well informed.  For the plan to  work,  we\r\n\r\nneed  every Singaporean to work together towards this objective.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that the Police should conduct more  public\r\n\r\ntalks and publicity so that the intention and objectives of  the\r\n\r\nplan  can  reach  out to every one.  May I have  the  Minister's\r\n\r\ncomments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, since the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  Community  Focus  Plan, many residents  and  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders have come to realise that everyone has a role in  making\r\n\r\nour  neighbourhood  safer  and  more  secure.   The  partnership\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Home  Team  and  residents  has  also  helped   to\r\n\r\nrevitalise the \"kampung spirit\" of our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote two examples illustrating the exemplary\r\n\r\npartnership  between  the residents and  police  to  effectively\r\n\r\ntackle  community-based safety and security  problems.   Between\r\n\r\n1996 and June last year, there was a spate of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvandalism to over 50 vehicles at a multi-storey carpark in  Chua\r\n\r\nChu  Kang.   Recognising  the need to address  the  problem  and\r\n\r\npreserve the community's trust, the Yew Tee Neighbourhood Police\r\n\r\nPost  and  Yew Tee RC proposed to set up a Vehicles Watch  Group\r\n\r\ncompromising  50  volunteer vehicle owners to look  after  their\r\n\r\nvehicles.   The plan was a resounding success and the  spree  of\r\n\r\nvandalism was effectively curbed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project was that undertaken by the Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nSouth  NPP and Bukit Panjang grassroots leaders.  They  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Police  decided to curb the  problem  of  teen  gangs\r\n\r\nprevalent  in  the area.  Hence, they organised  visits  to  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Police  Station  for  problematic  students  where   the\r\n\r\nstudents were shown the Police lock-up and viewed video shows on\r\n\r\nthe grave consequences of joining teen gangs.  This was followed\r\n\r\nby  visits  to  the  homes of these students by  the  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders,  Police  and their teachers so as to  understand  their\r\n\r\nhome  background  and get their family support  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nyouths  from  going wayward.  Favourable feedback revealed  that\r\n\r\nthe   programme  had  benefited  both  the  students  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above examples clearly demonstrate a stronger sense of\r\n\r\ncommunity involvement, belonging and care.  It is this  internal\r\n\r\nresilience  that  will  see us through in  good  and  bad  times\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a few suggestions to the Home\r\n\r\nTeam  on how we can build on a good start made by CFP and  bring\r\n\r\nit to the next level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Publicity. More articles or success stories of community\r\n\r\nsafety  and  security  programmes  could  be  featured  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and media so as to further increase participation  by\r\n\r\nresidents in CFP activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Training. The Home Team can provide more support to train\r\n\r\nvolunteers  so  as to instil confidence in them to  conduct  CFP\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Funding. More funding and resources should be given to the\r\n\r\nHome Team and CDC to support CFP activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Recognition.

The sight of men in  blue\r\n\r\nuniform  has always given  residents the assurance that  all  is\r\n\r\nwell,  knowing that there is somebody to watch over them.   This\r\n\r\nis  especially  true  in the new estates  where  residents  have\r\n\r\neither not moved in or where strangers are not easily identified\r\n\r\nbecause residents have yet to know one another.  In some  cases,\r\n\r\nthe  design of HDB flats is such that it makes these flats  more\r\n\r\nprone to break-in by burglars either because the windows provide\r\n\r\neasy  access or because the apartment blocks face an open  space\r\n\r\nopposite  it.  Whatever it is, these apartment blocks  are  very\r\n\r\nprone to break-ins as indeed is the case of Neighbourhood  7  in\r\n\r\nmy constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very concerned about the break-ins and have on\r\n\r\nmany occasions asked the police to see what further measures can\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to help crime prevention in the estate.  I know  that\r\n\r\nPolice  resources are limited and I have often told my residents\r\n\r\nthat policemen are not jagas for the estate.  The residents  are\r\n\r\nbeing told that crime prevention is as much their duty as it  is\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have requested for a Neighbourhood Police Post and I hope\r\n\r\nthat it will be granted in the near future.  At the same time, I\r\n\r\nam  aware  that the Police are constrained by limited  resources\r\n\r\nand are constantly looking at more effective ways to improve its\r\n\r\nmonitoring system of the estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my grassroots leaders have suggested the use of camera\r\n\r\nsurveillance as a means of crime prevention.  I thought it was a\r\n\r\ngood  suggestion principally for two reasons.

This will not only serve to deter  crime  but\r\n\r\nalso serve to record the necessary evidence for prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as part of the Community Focus Plan, residents\r\n\r\ncan  be  roped  in  together to raise funds to  build  a  camera\r\n\r\nsurveillance system to help play a part in ensuring  the  safety\r\n\r\nand  security  in the estate.  I have instructed  my  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  to look into this possibility because, as I have  said,\r\n\r\nit is a good plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry would\r\n\r\nconsider  supporting both financially or otherwise  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncamera  surveillance in housing estates as  a  means  to  combat\r\n\r\ncrimes in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Lianhe\r\n\r\nZaobao earlier this month reported that the first two months  of\r\n\r\n1999,  compared to the similar period in 1998, showed an overall\r\n\r\ndecline  in  crimes,  such  as theft,  car  theft,  robbery  and\r\n\r\nhousebreaking.   The  police  must  be  commended   for   making\r\n\r\nSingapore a safe place to live despite this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the police can do more if grassroots leaders, residents\r\n\r\nin  housing estates as well as social service centres  cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  the  police  and  find new ways  to  combat  neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncrimes.  This capability in maintaining \"law and order\"  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  by different community agencies working  together\r\n\r\nto support the police is what I mean by \"community policing\".  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Community Focus Plan (CFP) is  set  up  with  this\r\n\r\nobjective in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few working ideas to add to this\r\n\r\nPolice effort in enhancing community policing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mindsetting frontline junior police officers the\r\n\r\nsignificance of their role as a lead collaborative agent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Offer joint training programmes with other community leaders\r\n\r\nto   enhance  cross-boundary  learning  capability   and   cross\r\n\r\npollination of ideas and reflections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  remove institutional turfs and promote on-our-feet\r\n\r\nsolutions  to community problems.  This way it will address  the\r\n\r\nlower  awareness in the community about CFP that  was  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier by Mr Kenneth Chen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Set clear ethos of cooperation between groups to avoid this\r\n\r\n\"passing the buck\" when a crisis situation arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Establish clear guidelines and protocols for all concerned\r\n\r\non  how to go about tackling a crime in combined effort.  Let us\r\n\r\nsay  a  neighbour spotted a burglar breaking in  a  house,  what\r\n\r\naction  must follow?  Or an alcoholic neighbour is heard beating\r\n\r\nup  the  wife,  what  can the witness do?   The  guidelines  and\r\n\r\nprotocols must be made simple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Furnish residents in the neighbourhood with the relevant key\r\n\r\ntelephone numbers for assistance and information on what actions\r\n\r\nto adopt.  The language in the brochures must be made simple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Establish a recognition scheme of \"Friend of the Police\" for\r\n\r\nresidents who have done something that is effective in combating\r\n\r\ncrime  in  the  neighbourhood.  If we highlight  this  publicity\r\n\r\nevent,  as  suggested by Dr Teo Ho Pin, it  will  help  to  reap\r\n\r\nawareness and participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Carry out neighbourhood focus groups from youth to elderly\r\n\r\nones  to make \"alive\" this spirit of CFP.  Working with National\r\n\r\nYouth  Council  or  forming  local  volunteer  youth  \"vigilante\r\n\r\ngroups\"  can be one possible initiative.  This will  absorb  the\r\n\r\nexcessive restless energy of teenagers and direct them away from\r\n\r\ncrime   and  self-indulgent  activities  that  were  highlighted\r\n\r\nearlier by Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Chng Hee Kok.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one may think that all these are simple enough suggestions\r\n\r\nto  propose, the difficulty we all know is in implementing  even\r\n\r\nsuch  a  simple plan of inter-agency cooperation and action.   A\r\n\r\nsignificant amount of time and energy and resources have  to  be\r\n\r\nspent on collaborative formation.  It is in my view a worthwhile\r\n\r\ninvestment for the police to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommit  to a training process in a continuous annual cycle  with\r\n\r\nother  agencies.  People do not become self-organising  networks\r\n\r\nwithout  spending time together to learn and do things together.\r\n\r\nI  hope  my  preliminary reflections are helpful to  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce to seriously look into ways of linking people to carry out\r\n\r\npolicing  responsibility.  Otherwise, cooperation will  only  be\r\n\r\nconceptual on paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, last year, it was reported that some\r\n\r\n23,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended.  This is a very high\r\n\r\nnumber  and  works  out  to no less than 60  illegal  immigrants\r\n\r\napprehended  every day.  One must wonder at the numbers  roaming\r\n\r\nin   our  midst.   The  worsening  economic  situation  in   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries could well be a contributing  factor  and\r\n\r\nthe driving force behind the waves of illegal entries.  Will the\r\n\r\nMinister highlight to the House the number of illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nfrom  Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and other countries?   If\r\n\r\nthey  are attracted to Singapore by the hope of a better  living\r\n\r\nhere,  have  they come here knowing full well that we  are  very\r\n\r\nstrict  in  enforcing  the  law against  them?   Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nworthwhile being arrested and imprisoned here because then,  the\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants would be assured of good food,  shelter  and\r\n\r\nmedical care in our prisons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, around this time last year, there was frequent publicity of\r\n\r\nreports  of  police raids and arrests of big numbers of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.   Since then such media publicity  appears  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  muted.  If the publicity drops, does it signal a  decrease\r\n\r\nin the number of raids or does it mean that the problem is under\r\n\r\ncontrol?  The danger of doing less and less publicity is that it\r\n\r\nmay send a wrong signal that the Government is now less vigilant\r\n\r\nor  strict in its enforcement.  Alternatively, did the publicity\r\n\r\nforce  the  illegal immigrants to go into hiding at  less  well-known places such that the police have become less successful in\r\n\r\ntheir raids?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the occasional arrests and the attendant media\r\n\r\npublicity,  there are still people willing to risk being  caught\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhiding  illegal immigrants in the car boots or lorries  carrying\r\n\r\ngoods  coming into Singapore through the Causeway.  Their reward\r\n\r\nis  usually  just a few hundred dollars.  For them to  take  the\r\n\r\nrisk  means that it is lucrative business if they are not caught\r\n\r\nand  that  is  why there are still people who want to  take  the\r\n\r\nchance  of being caught.  Perhaps, the Government has still  not\r\n\r\ndone  enough  publicity in countries from  where  these  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  come from to let them know that our  laws  are  very\r\n\r\ntough  and  the  efforts  of  our law enforcement  officers  are\r\n\r\nrelentless  and  thorough.   All  airlines  announce  to   their\r\n\r\npassengers  before  they  alight that Singapore  has  the  death\r\n\r\npenalty  for  drug traffickers.  Can we also not let  them  know\r\n\r\nthat  our  immigration laws are equally unrelenting for  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants?   I  therefore suggest that the Government  consider\r\n\r\ntaking  up  more  publicity or in certain  cases,  if  possible,\r\n\r\nadvertisements in these foreign countries periodically to  drive\r\n\r\nhome this message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that publicity of our efforts has in fact\r\n\r\nreduced  the  number  of illegal immigrants coming  from  Batam.\r\n\r\nIllegal  immigrants should not be locked up for long periods  of\r\n\r\ntime  because  that  would be a drain of taxpayers'  money.   We\r\n\r\nshould  publicise how we deal with illegal immigrants   who  are\r\n\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the region's economic problems far from being over, we must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  for  further  influx of illegal  immigrants.   Our\r\n\r\nrising  crime  rate  has also been partially blamed  on  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  Will the Minister assure Singaporeans that we  have\r\n\r\nthe problem under control?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the turmoil in neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  resulting  from the economic crisis,  especially  the\r\n\r\ndeteriorating  situation  in  Indonesia,  has  given   rise   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans worrying whether there would be a great  influx  of\r\n\r\nillegal   immigrants   coming  to  Singapore.    These   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  not  only  disrupt our social  stability,  but  also\r\n\r\nthreaten  the security of our country.  From time  to  time,  we\r\n\r\nlearn from the newspapers that the Police have managed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndetect  and repatriate these illegal immigrants coming into  our\r\n\r\nshores.   But how many have successfully slipped through despite\r\n\r\nour  tight  security?   As these illegal  immigrants  and  their\r\n\r\nsyndicates will come up with more and more ingenious methods  to\r\n\r\nget  into  our  country, perhaps it is time to deal  with  these\r\n\r\nsyndicates caught in the act more severely.  There is a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  that  \"without the head, the snake cannot move\".   So  I\r\n\r\nthink it is only right to disable the head of this syndicate  so\r\n\r\nthat  these illegal immigrants would not have an avenue to  come\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister can give us an update of\r\n\r\nthe  situation.   Firstly, where is the bulk  of  these  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants from?  Secondly, which are the most vulnerable points\r\n\r\nof  entry?   Thirdly,  which are the likely places  where  these\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  hide when they enter  Singapore,  and  what\r\n\r\nplans  have been formulated to ensure that our borders be closed\r\n\r\nto these intrusions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the figure\r\n\r\nquoted  by  Mr  Chng Hee Kok is really alarming.   We  must  not\r\n\r\nwelcome  these unwelcomed visitors.  The point, as  pointed  out\r\n\r\nearlier  by  speakers, is to tackle the problem  at  source.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister's response as to what steps  have\r\n\r\nbeen taken to prevent these illegal immigrants from coming.  Can\r\n\r\nwe  launch advertisements in newspapers and the media  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries  to  warn  them of the consequences  that  if  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants are arrested, they face severe punishment.  It  would\r\n\r\nappear   that  despite  a  very  stringent  law,  these  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  still come to Singapore.  The reason  could  be  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation in this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects which I want the Minister to consider.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Singaporeans have a duty to see that they do not in any\r\n\r\nway  help  these illegal immigrants.  The moment that they  know\r\n\r\nthat  somebody  is  a suspected illegal immigrant,  they  should\r\n\r\nreport to the authority.  And if every Singaporean takes this as\r\n\r\na national concern, I think we can succeed.  Secondly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  have another suggestion for the Minister.  For those national\r\n\r\nservicemen  who  serve  the  Singapore  Police  Force,  can   we\r\n\r\nauthorise  them to act as Special Police?  We could  train  them\r\n\r\nand  they could be empowered to arrest.  I think this is another\r\n\r\naspect  of  community policing which the Minister  may  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, an English woman,\r\n\r\nMiss  Leigton,  took two half tablets of Ecstasy,  in  a  London\r\n\r\nnight club, over an interval of three hours and when she woke up\r\n\r\nlater  that  day, she collapsed because she had  suffered  brain\r\n\r\ndamage  due to a lack of oxygen to the brain.  How many  of  our\r\n\r\nSingaporean youths know about the hazards of Ecstasy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ecstasy is an illegal synthetic so-called designer drug. A\r\n\r\ndesigner  drug  mimics  an  already  illegal  drug  by  slightly\r\n\r\naltering the chemical composition.  Ecstasy is also called  MDMA\r\n\r\n(methylene-dioxy-meth-amphetamine).  The amount of  MDMA  needed\r\n\r\nto  get  \"high\" is close to the toxic dose.  Ecstasy acts  as  a\r\n\r\nstimulant  to  the  central nervous system.   Immediate  effects\r\n\r\ninclude  feelings  of  detachment,  feelings  of  euphoria   and\r\n\r\nincrease  in  heart  rate.  Immediate side-effects  are  nausea,\r\n\r\nfainting  and  even  death. Long-term  effects  are  high  blood\r\n\r\npressure, psychotic episodes, kidney failure, stroke and death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now \"killer drugs\" which may have 33 times the\r\n\r\npotency  of  Ecstasy  flooding night clubs  in  Britain.   Those\r\n\r\nbuying  them have no idea of their strength and often  find  out\r\n\r\ntoo  late.   We  in  Singapore have  to  be  extra  vigilant  in\r\n\r\npreventing their entry into our market.  New variations  in  the\r\n\r\npharmacological make-up of these drugs may allow drug pushers to\r\n\r\nescape  detection and punishment.  One of these drugs, so-called\r\n\r\n\"Flatliners\", has killed several people, while another, known as\r\n\r\n\"DOB\",   makes   Ecstasy   seem  like  aspirin.    Dealers   and\r\n\r\nmanufacturers are pushing any substance that they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nsell  in a buyer's market.  The market has been greedy both  for\r\n\r\nnew  drugs and for the vast sums of money that can be made  from\r\n\r\nthese drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to be\r\n\r\nvigilant  and  to be mindful of the variants of Ecstasy  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  scene.  May I also ask for redoubled efforts in combating\r\n\r\nthe  drug  abuse  from  all angles, including  increased  public\r\n\r\neducation,  concerning  the  risks  of  drug  use,  targeted  at\r\n\r\nchildren and parents?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nChng  Hee Kok is concerned about the rising crime rate and asked\r\n\r\nfor  an  assurance that the Police would do something to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  it  does  not go up.  We must put the 1998 crime  data  in\r\n\r\nperspective.  Although crime rate went up by 5.2% last year,  if\r\n\r\nwe  compare that with 1997, excluding the immigration offenders,\r\n\r\ncrime rate only went up by 4.4%,  There is still no comfort that\r\n\r\ncrime  rate has gone up.  If we take into account the population\r\n\r\ngrowth   and  we  measure  crime  rate  by,  say,  per   100,000\r\n\r\npopulation,  the crime rate actually only went up by 1%, because\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  population  growth in  1998.   Despite  that,  an\r\n\r\nincrease in crime rate is still a cause for concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the 1998 data, we are actually going back to the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  1995 or 1996 and that is about the same  rate  of\r\n\r\ncrime that happened during the two years that I mentioned.  This\r\n\r\nis  against a backdrop of nine consecutive years of decrease  in\r\n\r\ncrime.   From the measures that the Police have taken  plus  the\r\n\r\npublicity  and  crime preventive programmes, we seem  to  see  a\r\n\r\nslight decline in the last few months of 1998 and the first  two\r\n\r\nmonths of 1999.  We hope this trend will continue and we hope to\r\n\r\nbe able to return to the normal low crime rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will continue to step up anti-crime patrols and\r\n\r\nenforcement  actions  in  crime-prone  areas.   With   the   new\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Police Centre concept, residents in the  community\r\n\r\ncan  be  assured  of  faster Police response and  more  frequent\r\n\r\npatrols and better quality on-the-scene investigations.  We will\r\n\r\nset up 32 Neighbourhood Police Centres in the whole of Singapore\r\n\r\nand,  so  far,  four  NPCs  have been set  up  in  Jurong  East,\r\n\r\nQueenstown, Clementi and Bukit Merah West.  Feedback so far from\r\n\r\nthe residents is that these NPCs are doing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell  in  ensuring the safety and the security of our residents.\r\n\r\n28 more NPCs will be implemented over the next three years, with\r\n\r\nsix coming on stream this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although crime has increased, when we look at the figures, we\r\n\r\nknow that the increase in crime mainly related to property crime\r\n\r\nand  a lot of these crimes can be prevented had precautions been\r\n\r\ntaken.    For  example,  the  number  of  thefts  from  vehicles\r\n\r\nincreased  sharply from 3,470 cases in 1997 to  5,620  cases  in\r\n\r\n1998,  and that is a very sharp increase of 62%.  In most cases,\r\n\r\nit  is because the Cashcards and the handphones were left in the\r\n\r\ncar,  exposed, unattended, and therefore, inviting  opportunists\r\n\r\nand  criminals to take advantage of breaking into  the  car  and\r\n\r\nstealing  the  item.   If vehicle owners take  precaution,  they\r\n\r\nwould  save themselves a lot of trouble in having to go  through\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  reporting the crime and suffering  losses  and\r\n\r\ndamage to the car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, the Police will focus on public education\r\n\r\non  crime  prevention measures and also through crime prevention\r\n\r\nexhibitions and public media such as the Crime Watch series.  It\r\n\r\nwill  highlight the common modus operandi used by the  criminals\r\n\r\nand give advice on how to prevent the crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give some examples of these measures that the Police\r\n\r\nwould  take.  For example, to deter motor vehicle thefts,  crime\r\n\r\nprevention  signboards will be put up in multi-storey  carparks.\r\n\r\nA  notice  of  advice will also be placed on the  windscreen  to\r\n\r\nremind owners not to leave valuables unattended and exposed.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  motor vehicle importers will  be  approached  to\r\n\r\ninstall  security features in the vehicles at the point of  sale\r\n\r\nsuch  as  vehicle  number  engraving,  installation  of  burglar\r\n\r\nalarms, etc.  Insurance companies are also encouraged to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe insurance premium to vehicle owners who take steps to secure\r\n\r\ntheir own vehicles.  The Police will also work closely with  the\r\n\r\nManpower  Ministry,  URA,  the developers,  town  councils,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Retailers' Association and various grassroots  bodies\r\n\r\nin the implementation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  watch  zone schemes.  These  coordinated  efforts\r\n\r\nhave  proven to be effective in curtailing the rise of crime  in\r\n\r\nthe last quarter of 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards illegal immigrants who come to Singapore to seek\r\n\r\nemployment and can pose a danger to our social security,  Police\r\n\r\nhave also stepped up their patrols in our territorial waters  to\r\n\r\ndetect  their entries.  On land, the Police have conducted  many\r\n\r\nmajor   operations  against  immigration  offenders,   including\r\n\r\nagainst the employers and harbourers of these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are right that it is important that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  play  a  proactive role in ensuring a  safe  and  secure\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Community Focus Plan (CFP) was crafted to enable\r\n\r\nlocal  community organisations and the residents to tackle these\r\n\r\nsecurity  and safety issues in their own areas.  The Police  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that  with the shared ownership of these  programmes,\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of  safety  and security in the  community  will  be\r\n\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also asked how we can educate our people,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  youths,  on crime  and  the  consequences  of\r\n\r\ncommitting  crime.   MHA  has several programmes  involving  the\r\n\r\nyouths, to educate them that they should not commit crime.   For\r\n\r\nexample, we have got a formal crime prevention programme in  the\r\n\r\nschool  curriculum.   This is being taught  as  part  of  social\r\n\r\nstudies.    The  programme  seeks  to  impart  crime  prevention\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  to  impress upon the students the  importance  of\r\n\r\nrespecting the law.  A set of textbooks called \"Mr Policeman  is\r\n\r\nmy  friend\"  for  kindergartens and  \"Mr  Policeman\"  for  upper\r\n\r\nprimary  and  lower  secondary students are now  being  used  by\r\n\r\nschools.  The Police and CNB officers also conduct joint  school\r\n\r\ntalks   on  the  consequences  of  being  involved  in  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency, secret societies and drug abuse.  These  talks  are\r\n\r\ngiven to small groups of high risk students comprising not  more\r\n\r\nthan  50 students a group.  This will enable officers to counsel\r\n\r\nthe students more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a programme called the Caution and Visit Programme\r\n\r\nwhich is part of the rehabilitative programme for youths.   They\r\n\r\nare  either  students  or out-of-school  youths  who  have  been\r\n\r\nidentified  as  gang members or were involved in  gangs.   These\r\n\r\nyouths  are  first  cautioned  by the  officers  of  the  Secret\r\n\r\nSocieties  Branch  of the CID against future  gang  involvement.\r\n\r\nBesides attending talks conducted by the CID, these youths  will\r\n\r\nalso  take part in the prison visit programme so as to let  them\r\n\r\nexperience  the  harsh  realities of  prison  life.   This  tour\r\n\r\nincludes a live mock caning session.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On drug rehabilitation or preventive-drug education, we also\r\n\r\nhave  a  Drug Rehabilitation Centre Visit Programme which  is  a\r\n\r\njoint effort in preventive drug education by CNB and the Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment.  This programme was initiated in 1990, and up to now\r\n\r\nmore  than  50,000 students and youths have taken  part  in  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Anti-drug  lectures  and  tours  of  the  DRCs  are\r\n\r\nconducted for these students or youths during each DRC visit.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua's concern about sending youths to visit\r\n\r\nthese  institutions is already being carried out.   We  have  an\r\n\r\nInter-Ministry  Committee on Youth Crime which  coordinates  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the  various  agencies to  tackle  the  problem  of\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng is concerned about road bully incidents reported in\r\n\r\nthe  press where motorists resorted to violence over the use  of\r\n\r\nthe road, and he suggested enhanced punishment for road bullies.\r\n\r\nThe  Police  take a very serious view of road bullies  and  have\r\n\r\ntaken  very tough measures against them.  Over the years,  tough\r\n\r\npolice enforcement action plus deterrent sentence handed down by\r\n\r\nthe  courts  have  helped to keep the problem  in  check.   Road\r\n\r\nbullying  incidents have actually declined from 14  in  1994  to\r\n\r\nonly  3  in 1998.  Mr Chng said that many cases were unreported.\r\n\r\nI  would  advise these people to report them so that the  Police\r\n\r\ncan look into their problem.  If they do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreport, then what Police have in hand are reported cases, and it\r\n\r\nshows that there is a decline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain the deterrent effect, in fact, I amended the Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act  just recently to empower the courts to  disqualify\r\n\r\nroad  bullies  from driving.  With effect from  1st  March  this\r\n\r\nyear, the court can disqualify drivers who are road bullies from\r\n\r\nholding  licences  if they are convicted of certain  Penal  Code\r\n\r\noffences,  including  voluntarily causing hurt  and  voluntarily\r\n\r\ncausing   grievous  hurt  to  other drivers  or  the  passengers\r\n\r\narising   from  road  accidents  or  disputes.   Motorists   who\r\n\r\ntherefore resort to violence on the road will risk losing  their\r\n\r\nright to drive, in addition to being charged for the act of road\r\n\r\nbullying.   I  do  not  see  a need right  now  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\npenalties,  as  suggested by Mr Chng.  But we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  this and if there is a real cause for concern  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  do something more than what we are now doing, we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members talked about the Community Focus Plan (CFP) that\r\n\r\nthe  Home  Team agencies, not just the Police,  and the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  have  implemented.  The  Community  Focus  Plan  is\r\n\r\nindeed a new initiative launched by the CDCs in partnership with\r\n\r\nMHA agencies.  Each CFP is simply a series of action plans drawn\r\n\r\nup  jointly  by  the  CDC,  the  grassroots  organisations,  the\r\n\r\nresidents  and  the  Home Team agencies to tackle  the  specific\r\n\r\nsafety  and  security  issues in a particular  community.   This\r\n\r\napproach  draws  on the residents' own knowledge  of  their  own\r\n\r\ncommunity's safety and security issues to work out solutions  to\r\n\r\nthe  problems that they face.  Each CFP is therefore tailor made\r\n\r\nto  address  the unique needs of each community.  This  targeted\r\n\r\napproach would therefore yield better results than one-size-fits-all approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that this CFP is not a disguised\r\n\r\nattempt  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  transfer  its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   to   residents   or   to    the    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.  MHA will continue to be responsible for ensuring\r\n\r\nthe safety and security of all Singaporeans, but the CFP\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninitiative will promote self-help and mutual support to build up\r\n\r\na  more cohesive and caring community.  This is something  which\r\n\r\nthe MHA cannot do without the community's involvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank several Members for citing examples of the CFP\r\n\r\ninitiative   and   how  they  have  succeeded   in   their   own\r\n\r\nconstituencies, and we ought to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about getting residents work with the Home\r\n\r\nTeam  and have a CFP programme to install cameras within certain\r\n\r\nplaces.   Let  me  give an example where this has  already  been\r\n\r\ndone.  Vagrants and displaced workers were found sleeping in the\r\n\r\nfood court in Chander Road at night.  After some discussion with\r\n\r\nthe  Tek  Kah RC Chairman and the Police, the owner of the  food\r\n\r\ncourt  actually  installed and managed six  CCTVs  in  the  food\r\n\r\ncourt.   He  also  lit  up the place.  The situation  has  since\r\n\r\nimproved.  So the proposal to install security cameras or  CCTVs\r\n\r\nin  strategic  locations is not new, and has been  found  to  be\r\n\r\neffective.    The   Police   will   encourage   the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and  the community to install  these  cameras  in\r\n\r\ncrime-prone  areas to supplement the Police presence  and  deter\r\n\r\ncrime.  We are happy to work with the community organisations to\r\n\r\nimplement this local initiative if they find the need to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also asked about how the CFP initiative has\r\n\r\nprogressed  so  far.  As I said, quite a few of  our  CDCs  have\r\n\r\nalready implemented the CFP programme, eg, Tanjong Pagar,  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah,  Sembawang  and Hong Kah CDCs have  implemented  the  CFP\r\n\r\nprogramme since 1998.   By the end of this year or so,  all  the\r\n\r\nCDCs would have implemented the CFP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with some Members that this term \"CFP\" may not be easily\r\n\r\nunderstood,  and  we need to do a bit more  publicity.   I  have\r\n\r\nasked  the People's Association and the Police to look into  how\r\n\r\nwe  can find a new term to better explain what CFP really  means\r\n\r\nto the residents, and they are now brainstorming for a new term,\r\n\r\nand this will be announced later when they have found a new word\r\n\r\nor term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need indeed to communicate the CFP initiative to the\r\n\r\npublic,  so  that we can raise the awareness of this  programme.\r\n\r\nThe  PA  and  the  Home  Team agencies will  mount  a  sustained\r\n\r\npublicity  programme to educate the public on  the  benefits  of\r\n\r\ntaking part in the CFP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang talked about changing mindsets and training\r\n\r\nthe people.  Indeed, that is the case.  CFP involves a shift  in\r\n\r\nmindset, not just of the officers taking part or doing the  CFP,\r\n\r\nbut  mindset of the people in general, that safety and  security\r\n\r\nis  the concern of only the Government.  It is not.  Safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  is  the  concern of everyone who lives  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLike  Mr Rai said, every citizen should be concerned about their\r\n\r\nown  security,  when  they  deal with  illegal  immigrants,  for\r\n\r\nexample.   So  we want everyone to share in this responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut,   of  course,  MHA  would  not  run  away  from  its   main\r\n\r\nresponsibility of ensuring safety and security.  The PA and  MHA\r\n\r\nhave conducted a number of courses/programmes for the grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  and  the Home Team officers to change the  mindsets  of\r\n\r\nthese  people who are involved in the CFP.  If there  are  other\r\n\r\norganisations  that  need to be involved in  the  CFP,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary  social  workers and the voluntary  organisations,  we\r\n\r\nwill  also  involve  them.   It is  not  just  CDCs,  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and the Home Team, but if there  are  others  who\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  involved, we will certainly include them  in  this\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training of officers therefore is important in changing the\r\n\r\nmindset of the people, and the various suggestions put forth  by\r\n\r\nMdm  Chiang, such as the joint training with the staff, with the\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders and so on, are already being done.   We  will\r\n\r\nconsider  the other suggestions and implement them if  they  are\r\n\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for funding, the PA and the MHA are committed in providing\r\n\r\nthe necessary resources to ensure that the CFP implementation is\r\n\r\neffective  and  successful.   In  general,  we  will  adopt  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of co-funding in the implementation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCFP  activities.   Then there is ownership  and  there  is  also\r\n\r\nshared responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked how we can recognise the grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nand  organisations and others taking part in the CFP.  For those\r\n\r\norganisations  under  the PA, we will take  into  account  their\r\n\r\nparticipation in CFP by  awarding them points when  we  consider\r\n\r\nawards  for  PA  organisations like the CCC, RC  and  the  CCMC.\r\n\r\nThere could be a new category like Friends of the Police, as Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire Chiang has suggested, and indeed if there are such  other\r\n\r\ncategories  which will contribute to the CFP, we will  think  of\r\n\r\nnew ways of recognising them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members also spoke on the illegal immigrant situation which\r\n\r\nI  briefly touched earlier on.  Let me now elaborate a bit  more\r\n\r\non  the illegal immigration offender situation.  I said that  in\r\n\r\n1998,  about  23,000  immigration offenders were  arrested,  and\r\n\r\nimmigration    offenders   include   illegal   immigrants    and\r\n\r\noverstayers.   Mr  Chng  earlier on gave the  figure  of  23,000\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants.  That is not correct.  We only  had  14,000\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants arrested last year.  But the total number  of\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders arrested last year was 23,000.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  9,000  of  them  were  overstayers.   This  is  a   very\r\n\r\nsignificant increase over the figure that we had in 1997.  Where\r\n\r\ndo they come from?  These immigration offenders come mainly from\r\n\r\nthe region, ie, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and\r\n\r\nThailand.   These are the major contributors to our  immigration\r\n\r\noffender problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they come? They came through our checkpoints or they\r\n\r\nsmuggled themselves in by boats, cars, lorries, motorcycles  and\r\n\r\nother  means.  9,000 of them came in legally with proper  social\r\n\r\nvisit  pass,  but they overstayed in Singapore, and they  became\r\n\r\noverstayers  and  therefore  also  fall  into  the  category  of\r\n\r\nimmigration offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do? We stepped up enforcement action since March\r\n\r\nlast  year against all these immigration offenders.  The  Police\r\n\r\nhave raided the various immigration offenders' haunts, including\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstruction sites, workplaces, forested areas.  The Police have\r\n\r\nalso   targeted  the  harbourers  and  the  employers  of  these\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders at their residential premises, such as HDB\r\n\r\nflats and lodging houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also conduct routine checks on the roads, set up road\r\n\r\nblocks,  at MRT stations and open areas to check on people  whom\r\n\r\nthey  suspect to be an immigration offender.  So the Police have\r\n\r\nstepped up their efforts in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement at sea, we have deployed our patrol boats to\r\n\r\ncheck  on motorised sampans which smuggle in illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nAnd  we have also used our radar system to detect any boats that\r\n\r\ncome  to  our shore and which are suspected to be boats bringing\r\n\r\nin  illegal immigrants.  We have also set up border patrols  and\r\n\r\nobservation  points  and  ambushes along  the  coastline,  where\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants tend to land in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the checkpoints, the Singapore Immigration and Registration\r\n\r\n(SIR) has also intensified the checks of people who come by air,\r\n\r\nsea  or  land, and those who are suspected to be illegal workers\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  allowed to come in.  Last year, SIR  turned  away\r\n\r\n23,000 such people who were suspected to be illegal  workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also mobilised other Home Team agencies' resources to\r\n\r\ndeal with this problem.  For example, we have deployed the Civil\r\n\r\nDefence dogs to sniff out the illegal immigrants who hide in car\r\n\r\nboots  or  in secret compartments of coaches, buses and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAnd those buses or vehicles which convey such illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nwill  be  confiscated, and those who smuggle illegal  immigrants\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore  will be heavily punished.   For  instance,  one\r\n\r\nperson  who smuggled in 15 illegal immigrants a few months  ago,\r\n\r\nwas  given a 10-year jail term and 24 strokes of the cane by the\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law was amended last year to impose stiffer penalties on the\r\n\r\nabetment of immigration offences.  We have also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  a presumption clause and introduced the onus  on  the\r\n\r\nsuspected illegal immigrant to satisfy the court that he was not\r\n\r\nattempting  to  enter Singapore illegally.  We will  review  our\r\n\r\nlegislation  from time to time to make sure that it  serves  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  protect  our  shores as well as to  deter  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On publicity and the suggestion on advertising in TV and\r\n\r\nnewspapers in other countries, we have thought about  that.   We\r\n\r\nare not sure how effective that will be because to advertise  in\r\n\r\nChina,  India,  Thailand, Indonesia, and to make sure  that  the\r\n\r\nadvertisements reach every of their citizens is  not  easy.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  SIR  does is that for every one of these illegal immigrant\r\n\r\nor  overstayers who is repatriated, he will be given  a  set  of\r\n\r\npress  cuttings, a set of newspaper reports, on what happens  to\r\n\r\nthese people, the police raids and the sentences that they  get.\r\n\r\nOn  the ferry boats that ply between Singapore and Indonesia, we\r\n\r\nalso  have video shows on them to show the stiff penalties  that\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants will face if they come into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we try as much as we can to deter people by telling them\r\n\r\nnot to come illegally.  The main message to all these people is:\r\n\r\ndo not even think about coming in illegally.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can certainly help us to deal with  this  problem.\r\n\r\nFor  example, if they suspect anybody to be an illegal immigrant\r\n\r\nor  overstayer,  they can report them to the police  and  action\r\n\r\nwill  be taken.  For those who harbour or employ them, they will\r\r\n\r\nalso be dealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that although there is a large number\r\n\r\nof  arrests  of  immigration offenders, the situation  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   The  Police,  the  SIR, and  the  various  Home  Team\r\n\r\nagencies  have  got the situation under control  and  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  raid the various places to flush out such  people.\r\n\r\nAll we need also is the cooperation of the press to publicise it\r\n\r\nso that every Singaporean is aware of it.  But they get tired of\r\n\r\nreporting  on the raids from time to time.   Because when  there\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntoo many raids, the press say it is the same old thing again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo is concerned about Ecstasy and other kinds of\r\n\r\npsychotropic  drugs.  Let me assure Dr Neo that the  problem  of\r\n\r\nEcstasy  and  its  variants are also well   under  control.   We\r\n\r\nanticipated this problem in 1996 and have taken prompt action to\r\n\r\nnip  the problem in the bud.  Ecstasy only emerged on our  local\r\n\r\nscene  in  1996.  CNB arrested 661 abusers and seized more  than\r\n\r\n39,000  Ecstasy pills in 1996.  The number of abusers fell  from\r\n\r\n661  in  1996  to  403 in 1997 and only to 180 last  year.   The\r\n\r\nnumber of Ecstasy pills seized also fell from 54,000 in 1997  to\r\n\r\nabout  2,200 in 1998. In any case, most of these pills that  are\r\n\r\nseized were actually intended for other countries rather than to\r\n\r\nbe  sold in Singapore.  Abuse of Ecstasy was controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nunrelenting  enforcement,  deterrent  custodial  sentences   and\r\n\r\nintensive  preventive educational efforts plus the tighter  laws\r\n\r\ntargeting at Ecstasy traffickers.  Like other countries, ecstasy\r\n\r\nabuse  is closely associated with night clubbing scenes and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  with rave dance parties.  Most of our abusers  were\r\n\r\narrested in discos or night entertainment outlets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, CNB has been working very closely with the night\r\n\r\nentertainment operators and owners to prevent Ecstasy  abuse  in\r\n\r\ntheir  premises.  CNB conducts regular raids at these places  to\r\n\r\nflush  the  abusers and the pushers.  Those found  not  to  have\r\n\r\ntaken  enough  measures,  their operating  hours  will  also  be\r\n\r\ncurtailed.    The  courts  have  also  meted  out  very   severe\r\n\r\nimprisonment  terms of between 12 and 18 months  to  an  Ecstasy\r\n\r\nabuser.  To deter smugglers and traffickers, the Misuse of Drugs\r\n\r\nAct  was  amended  last year to introduce a presumption  clause,\r\n\r\nwhich means that anyone arrested in possession of 10 grammes  or\r\n\r\nmore of Ecstasy would be deemed to be trafficking in that drug.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was concerned about the variants of the Ecstasy. So\r\n\r\nfar  we  have  not  detected any abuse or  presence  of  DOB  or\r\n\r\nflatliners, but CNB remains vigilant and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to take action to stamp out the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the  Ministry of Home Affairs to  exercise  more\r\n\r\ncontrol on discotheques and lounges.  Many  parents and teachers\r\n\r\nare  expressing  regrets  that the Government  has  relaxed  the\r\n\r\ncontrol over discotheques and lounges.  In particular, they  are\r\n\r\ngreatly  concerned and unhappy with the \"Foam Party\" at  Sentosa\r\n\r\nand the ladies-only discotheques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, a novel \"Foam Party\" at Sentosa attracted\r\n\r\nabout 500 participants, mainly teenagers.  Scantily dressed boys\r\n\r\nand  girls squeezed into a pool of thick foam and were in bodily\r\n\r\ncontact  with one another. Many openly embraced members  of  the\r\n\r\nopposite sex, even when they did not even know each other.  Some\r\n\r\nbrought  their own liquor, and some were under-aged.   According\r\n\r\nto  a  newspaper report, a 16 year-old student was seen  wearing\r\n\r\nonly brassiere and short skirts and fooling around with her  boy\r\n\r\nfriend  in  the  foam.   Many elderly Singaporeans  were  really\r\n\r\nsurprised by the degree of openness of these young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also one discotheque in Singapore which catered only\r\n\r\nfor  teenage girls. Among the patrons in the discotheque,   half\r\n\r\nof them were dressed as girls and the other half were dressed as\r\n\r\nboys.   Those  who  played the part of  boys  wore  T-shirt  and\r\n\r\ntrousers  with  men's  shoes.  They spotted  short  and  heavily\r\n\r\ngelled  hair.  At a glance, they looked like boys.  If  they  do\r\n\r\nnot open their mouth and talk, it is very difficult to tell that\r\n\r\nthey  were actually  girls.  Worse still, they were kissing each\r\n\r\nother.  Girls and girls were hugging each other.  Some even  sat\r\n\r\non the laps of the others.  It is very hard to believe that such\r\n\r\nthings can actually happen in this  decent  island of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These happenings have caused great concern among parents and\r\n\r\nteachers.   If  this  phenomenon  is  allowed  to  carry  on  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I believe the Minister for Education, the principals\r\n\r\nand teachers will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  lament the wasted efforts they have put in over the  years,\r\n\r\nand what have become of our young people.   In order to  prevent\r\n\r\nour  young boys and girls from going astray, I hope the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Home Affairs will exercise stricter control over discotheques\r\n\r\nand  lounges, especially those which allow hanky-panky  business\r\n\r\nto  be conducted within their premises,  so that the parents and\r\n\r\nteachers can feel at ease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, Members\r\n\r\nhave been listening to speeches about keeping the community safe\r\n\r\nfrom  the  offenders in our midst.  May I make a  plea  for  the\r\n\r\noffenders,  those who are arrested by the police.   Fortunately,\r\n\r\nit is still the cornerstone of our legal system that everyone is\r\n\r\npresumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.  Was it  last\r\n\r\nyear  that  I  gave  the  instance of  three  persons  who  were\r\n\r\ncompletely  innocent but were arrested on a  murder  charge  and\r\n\r\nonly  to  be acquitted some 39 months later?  I spoke about  the\r\n\r\nlong, long hours of questioning and denial of food to them.   It\r\n\r\nis not just them.  It is their families who also suffer.  At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  police rule is that members of  families  may  not\r\n\r\nvisit persons who are arrested until the police have carried out\r\n\r\ntheir investigations.  This may stretch to several days, if  not\r\n\r\nweeks.   This shows a complete lack of empathy for the  families\r\n\r\nof those who have been arrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether any steps are being considered by the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  lay  down  guidelines for the questioning and  treatment  of\r\n\r\noffenders  in police custody and, particularly, on the  question\r\n\r\nof allowing visits from members of families to see these persons\r\n\r\nwho have been arrested.  They suffer very much when they are not\r\n\r\ntold  even  on  what  charge a member of  the  family  has  been\r\n\r\narrested  and they are not allowed to see the member.   I  asked\r\n\r\nthis  last  year  after I mentioned the case of the  three  men.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not the only ones who confessed to crimes which  were\r\n\r\nnever  committed.   So  may  we know  whether  the  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ncontemplating   laying  down  guidelines  for   the   treatment,\r\n\r\nparticularly  questioning of and visits  by  family  members  to\r\n\r\npersons under police custody.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I was not able to catch your eye when\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has  replied.  May I  take  this  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nseeking  your  indulgence just to question the Minister  on  two\r\n\r\npoints he has not answered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point relates to my asking the Minister to review\r\n\r\nwhether he will repeal the Act against naming offenders who  are\r\n\r\nbelow  16  years old.  The second point I raised was a sentiment\r\n\r\nshared  by Mr Sin Boon Ann, ie, we would like to see more police\r\n\r\npresence.   It is granted that the  NPC would allow  for  better\r\n\r\nquality  investigation, but my question is: are we getting  more\r\n\r\npolice presence and has NPC resulted in less crime cases than in\r\n\r\nthe old Neighbourhood Police Post system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, before we continue, maybe I just\r\n\r\nrespond to these two points.  Right now, we do not see a need to\r\n\r\nreveal the names of under 16 offenders.  If there is a need  to,\r\n\r\nwe  will  do so.  We will have to consult the various  agencies,\r\n\r\nincluding the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the presence of police with the new Neighbourhood Police\r\n\r\nCentre  system, there is a greater number of patrols on the road\r\n\r\nthan  in  the  previous system where NPP officers sit  in  their\r\n\r\ncentre at certain times and wait for the public to see them  for\r\n\r\nservices  or to receive complaints from them.  Sir, actually  we\r\n\r\ndo see slightly more police on the roads on vehicles than in the\r\n\r\npast.   But  it  will take a while for this  NPC  system  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented throughout the whole of Singapore.  It will be  done\r\n\r\nby the year 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just remind hon.

I  think the Minister did indicate  last  year  that\r\n\r\nsomething  will  be  done  about it.   I  am  referring  to  our\r\n\r\ndeclining  workforce and manpower problems  and  we  should  not\r\n\r\ndeploy well-trained police\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficers  to  do the work of looking after car parking  offences\r\n\r\nand so on.

Our Government has given our people  a\r\n\r\nquality of life that is unsurpassed in Asia.  We live in a clean\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Our children go to good schools.  There is law and\r\n\r\norder  in  this country.  And the sky is the limit  if  you  are\r\n\r\ngood.   Quite  naturally  there are many more  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nwould  like to make Singapore their home.  However, it is  still\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for  us  to  take in the huddled  masses  because\r\n\r\nSingapore is just simply too small a country to do that.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  the  immigration authority is inundated with  applications\r\n\r\nfrom  non-Singaporeans to be Singapore permanent residents.   Up\r\n\r\nuntil recently, the process of granting permanent residence  has\r\n\r\nbeen shrouded in secrecy.  Not everyone knows how decisions  are\r\n\r\narrived   at,  although  everyone  can  understand   that   age,\r\n\r\neducational  level,  family background, are  some  of  the  main\r\n\r\nfactors taken into consideration when granting such requests.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present process has resulted in much frustration in\r\n\r\nsome applicants who sometimes are at a loss when in one case the\r\n\r\napplication  was  successful, but in another  similar  case  the\r\n\r\napplication was not.  Therefore, I was pleased to learn recently\r\n\r\nthat  the  immigration  authority in its  bid  to  have  greater\r\n\r\ntransparency  within  the bureaucracy has decided  to  publicise\r\n\r\nthose  criteria  on  which applications for permanent  residence\r\n\r\nwould  be  considered.  However, the announcement fell short  of\r\n\r\ntelling  members of the public what weightage would be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  various  criteria  listed and  how  many  points  one  must\r\n\r\naccumulate  before the applicant can succeed in its  application\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  a  reasonable chance to be considered in relation  to  his\r\n\r\napplication.   I  know  that immigration  authorities  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries, such as Canada, for example, are very open about  the\r\n\r\npoint  system that is used to assess the applicant's  chance  of\r\n\r\nsuccess in applying for permanent residence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the advantage of disclosing the weightage in advance\r\n\r\nis  that it would let the applicants know first whether they are\r\n\r\neven  qualified to apply and, secondly, it would encourage those\r\n\r\nwho  qualify  for permanent residence to apply and in  turn  can\r\n\r\nthen contribute to this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry will reconsider disclosing the weightage to be given to\r\n\r\nthe  various criteria in a foreigner's application for permanent\r\n\r\nresidence  in  Singapore so as to make the  application  process\r\n\r\nmore transparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am just as concerned about the\r\n\r\nnew criteria as Mr Sin Boon Ann.  I believe the new point system\r\n\r\nis  in  line with the Government's policy of attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent.   While I understand the need, in principle, to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  talent,  I am concerned whether our  citizens  will  be\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  by the policy or, worse, suffer  because  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think priority for approval of PR should be given to\r\n\r\nthose  whose spouses or parents are Singapore citizens.  I  came\r\n\r\nacross a case where a Singapore citizen mother, applying for her\r\n\r\ntwo  children to become PRs since 1987, was rejected.  I am also\r\n\r\nof  the  view that the criteria for this category of  applicants\r\n\r\nshould be made more transparent so that the applicants know what\r\n\r\nare  expected  of them.  Otherwise, they would be just  guessing\r\n\r\nwhy their applications are rejected while others are approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to know whether there is a quota system\r\n\r\nunder  which  applications are approved based on the  number  of\r\n\r\nquotas  for  each  category.  If so, how does the  quota  system\r\n\r\nwork?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rai is not here. Mr Chng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, until more recently, civil defence\r\n\r\nshelters were built in the void decks of HDB flats.  The  latest\r\n\r\ndevelopments are in Woodlands and Sengkang.  CD shelters are now\r\n\r\nlocated  in all flats, that means, every flat will have its  own\r\n\r\nindividual  civil  defence shelter.  However, Sir,  these  civil\r\n\r\ndefence  shelters take up some 10% of the space  in  the  flats.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the CD shelters are also made of reinforced  concrete\r\n\r\nand the owner of the flat is not allowed to puncture or drill  a\r\n\r\nhole  into the wall.  Therefore, these CD shelters are  in  fact\r\n\r\nvery  hot and humid and no air-conditioners can be installed  in\r\n\r\nthese  shelters.  Also, in the case of a major mishap,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  whole stack of CD shelters, one sitting on top  of  the\r\n\r\nother, and I think the rescue efforts will be very difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why there is a need for\r\n\r\nthe design of CD shelters to be located in each individual flat,\r\n\r\nand  whether  they  will go back to the older design  which  the\r\n\r\nowners of flats find more favourable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question for the Minister is: are these design\r\n\r\ncriteria   also   applicable  to  the  private  apartments   and\r\n\r\ncondominiums?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, my question is also\r\n\r\nsimilar to Mr Chng's.  At the beginning when we developed our CD\r\n\r\nshelters programme, we started with the CD shelters at the  void\r\n\r\ndeck.   The  Government bore those costs and continues  to  bear\r\n\r\nthose  costs  whereas, as at today, there is  a  requirement  to\r\n\r\nbuild a CD shelter in every new HDB flat.  When this matter  was\r\n\r\ndebated  in  the House, the Minister indicated that  Government,\r\n\r\nand  not  the  purchasers of the new HDB flats, would  bear  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of  those  shelters.  I understand that for  new  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums  and landed property, it is also a  requirement  to\r\n\r\nbuild  CD  shelters in those dwelling units.  But in the  latter\r\n\r\ncases,  the individual owners are required to bear those  costs.\r\n\r\nMay I ask the Minister why is there a discrepancy in funding  CD\r\n\r\nshelters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, let me first address Mr Peh's question. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  not relaxed its control over discos and  lounges.\r\n\r\nDiscos  and  lounges  are still subject to licensing  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  aim  to  prevent law and order problems such  as  fights,\r\n\r\novercrowding  and  social problems, like  immoral  and  indecent\r\n\r\nactivities and under-aged drinking.  There is no change  to  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  conditions.   In enforcing the licensing  conditions,\r\n\r\nPolice  conducts regular and random spot checks  at  discos  and\r\n\r\nlounges.   If  the  operator  is  found  to  have  violated  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  conditions,  his licence can  be  suspended  or  even\r\n\r\nforfeited,  or  his  operating hours  curtailed.   His  security\r\n\r\ndeposit  can also be forfeited.  For serious cases,  the  Police\r\n\r\nwould  prosecute the licensee in court who then faces a fine  of\r\n\r\nup to $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh mentioned foam parties. Police has advised the\r\n\r\norganisers  of such foam parties against violating  the  law  or\r\n\r\nallowing  immoral  or offensive activities  on  their  premises.\r\n\r\nPolice  will closely monitor any of them organising such events.\r\n\r\nThese parties, in fact, have toned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for 'all-girls' night parties, Police has been\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the  entertainment joints  organising  such  parties\r\n\r\nsince  1997,  to ensure that immoral or offensive activities  do\r\n\r\nnot  take  place.  There was only one disco that organised  such\r\n\r\nevents.   The operator was found to have infringed the licensing\r\n\r\nconditions by staging a dance performance by transvestites.   He\r\n\r\nwas charged in court and fined $2,000.  His operating hours were\r\n\r\nalso  curtailed  from  3.00 am to 1.00  am.   The  disco  ceased\r\n\r\noperation in October 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Peh that Police will continue to\r\n\r\nmonitor  these  activities and will not hesitate to  take  tough\r\n\r\naction to preserve public law and order and public morals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok's point is on privatisation of police\r\n\r\nservices.   Police  has  hitherto been the  sole  agency  taking\r\n\r\naction against illegal parking on public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nroads.    This  is  not  an  efficient  use  of  limited  police\r\n\r\nresources, as Mr Chng has said.  Issuing illegal parking summons\r\n\r\nis  a fairly straightforward task which does not require a fully\r\n\r\ntrained  police  officer  to perform.   Police  will  look  into\r\n\r\ngetting  suitable  companies in the private  sector  to  enforce\r\n\r\nillegal   parking.   This  will  free  up  scarce  manpower   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  critical functions such as attending  to  crime\r\n\r\ncases.   Police will call for tender in the middle of this  year\r\n\r\ninviting  private sector companies to apply.  For a  start,  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful private agency will be tried out at certain locations\r\n\r\nwhere  illegal  parking  is rampant.  The company's  performance\r\n\r\nwill be evaluated and reviewed regularly both to ensure that  it\r\n\r\nmeets  standards  set by Traffic Police before privatising  this\r\n\r\ntask of enforcing illegal parking island wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chng also asked about CD shelters, together with Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen.   I  will take the points  together.   Communal\r\n\r\nresidential  shelters  were first built in  HDB  void  decks  or\r\n\r\nbasements in 1987.  A 1994 review found that household  shelters\r\n\r\nhad  significant  advantages.  Household  shelters  would  offer\r\n\r\nimmediate protection to each household whereas it may  take  too\r\n\r\nlong a time for everyone in the home to make their way to a void\r\n\r\ndeck   or   basement  shelter.   Household  shelters  would   be\r\n\r\nespecially  vital  to  families  with  young  children,   senior\r\n\r\ncitizens or infirm members.  Household shelters would also allow\r\n\r\nthe  daily  living routine to continue as normally  as  possible\r\n\r\nduring an emergency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because its feasibility has to be tested, Government\r\n\r\ninitially bore the construction cost.  With the enactment of the\r\n\r\nCivil  Defence  Shelter Act requiring all new  HDB  and  private\r\n\r\ndwellings to provide shelters in 1997, HDB and private dwellings\r\n\r\nwill now bear the construction cost of their household shelters.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  now borne by the owners, which I think  makes  sense\r\n\r\nbecause  after all, it concerns their own safety.   This  ruling\r\n\r\napplies  to  all  HDB flats open for public selection  from  1st\r\n\r\nApril last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chng and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have made comments about\r\n\r\nthe  construction, the technical specifications  and  design  of\r\n\r\nthese shelters.  Let me assure them that from the beginning,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  was mindful of home owners' concerns about  the  space\r\n\r\ntaken  up by the shelter, its uses and its aesthetic value.   In\r\n\r\norder  to optimise the space and functionality of the HDB flats,\r\n\r\nthe storeroom in a HDB unit was chosen and fortified so that  it\r\n\r\ncould  double  up  as a shelter.  HDB owners can  also  use  the\r\n\r\nshelter  for other purposes such as a study. Of course,  certain\r\n\r\nrestrictions  will  be  necessary, for example,  non-hacking  of\r\n\r\ndoors, thickness of the walls, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, SCDF has helped house owners by issuing a list of do's\r\n\r\nand  dont's  guidelines on shelter renovation.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  can  approach  SCDF with their  queries,  including  any\r\n\r\ninnovative  proposals to use the shelters.   SCDF  continues  to\r\n\r\nwork  with the respective agencies to ensure that the design  of\r\n\r\nthe  shelter remains cost-effective and meets the public  needs,\r\n\r\nfunctionality and aesthetics.  Improvements made include surface\r\n\r\nwiring   of   earlier  design  to  concealed  wiring   and   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of a lighter design protective shelter  door.   So\r\n\r\nwhatever suggestions Mr Chng and Dr Wang would like to  make  on\r\n\r\nthe  design of the shelters will be welcome, and they  can  make\r\n\r\nthem to SCDF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain Members have asked about PR. We have got Mr Sin\r\n\r\nBoon  Ann.   His point is why do we not make it more transparent\r\n\r\nby  letting the public know the weightage.  Our PR policies  are\r\n\r\nintended  to attract foreigners who can contribute to Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  the  needs  of our economy and society change from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  we  will have to adjust our PR criteria and the  relative\r\n\r\nweightage accordingly.  Hence, the criteria and weightage  would\r\n\r\nalso  have  to be changed, depending on the number of foreigners\r\n\r\nwe   attract.   Apart  from  avoiding  possible  abuse,  letting\r\n\r\napplicants  know what the broad criteria are is sufficient,  and\r\n\r\ngives  Government the flexibility to fine-tune policies promptly\r\n\r\nand effectively in response to changes.  Mr Sin can rest assured\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore   Immigration  and  Registration  would  consider   PR\r\n\r\napplications   objectively  in  the   best   interest   of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  So I think it is best not to let them  know  also\r\n\r\nof the weightage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang made a point and asked whether or not the\r\n\r\nrequirement where a Singaporean sponsors his foreign  spouse  is\r\n\r\ntoo  stringent.   I  think  we  all  know  that  marriage  to  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  does not automatically qualify a foreigner  for  PR\r\n\r\nstatus.   The  Singaporean sponsoring his foreign  spouse  would\r\n\r\nneed  to show that he is able to support his spouse financially;\r\n\r\nin other words, the level of his income as well as the fact that\r\n\r\nhe  must  have a steady income.  The foreign spouse  would  also\r\n\r\nhave  to fulfil a residential requirement after marriage  before\r\n\r\nthe  PR is granted.  So these two are the basic conditions which\r\n\r\nare  known to Singaporeans.  Here again, the cut-off should  not\r\n\r\nbe  known because otherwise they will find ways to overcome  the\r\n\r\ncut-off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Low that all applications are again\r\n\r\nconsidered  carefully and in the interest  of  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  heart.   It  could  be  that  the  case  that  he\r\n\r\nmentioned, ie, since 1987, could be a matter of whether  or  not\r\n\r\nhis  income has been steady all this while.  His other point  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have quotas.  The answer is no.  We have  no  fixed\r\n\r\nquotas to the categories of PRs coming in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Jeyaretnam once again brings up this issue of rights\r\n\r\nof  accused  persons.  He wants to speak up for  the  offenders.\r\n\r\nLet  me  once  again assure him that Police is very diligent  in\r\n\r\ndoing  its job.  It must be so.  That is why we have got a  high\r\n\r\nreputation  not  only in Singapore but world-wide.   And  Police\r\n\r\nwill not do anything that will jeopardise this reputation.   The\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police, as the man in charge, has sent a  strong\r\n\r\nmessage  down to the ground.  Indeed the fact that  some  Police\r\n\r\nOfficers,  the  numbers are very small, have been prosecuted  in\r\n\r\ncourt  for  abusing their powers, shows that this is taken  very\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked this point about when and whether offenders can inform\r\n\r\nand  contact family members.  The principle is that the offender\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to contact family members, or indeed have  the\r\n\r\nfamily  members visit him, when it does not hinder or  undermine\r\n\r\npolice  investigation.  It must be so.  Otherwise  if  there  is\r\n\r\nhard  evidence outside, not all cases, but in some  cases,  some\r\n\r\nfamily   members  when  contacted  too  early,   before   police\r\n\r\ninvestigations have completed or reached a stage when they  feel\r\n\r\ncomfortable in allowing such contact, such evidence can be dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the family members.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point about whether there are guidelines, Police\r\n\r\nmonitors all court judgements carefully.  Judges have given very\r\n\r\ngood  guidelines  over  the  years as  to  what  is  permissible\r\n\r\nbehaviour when police interviews offenders.  So these are looked\r\n\r\nat  very  carefully and complied.  Recently, the police has  put\r\n\r\ntogether  an  interview  doctrine, putting  together  all  these\r\n\r\npoints which the courts have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Kenneth Chen.

They  can\r\n\r\nbe  suspended  for  a period of time because the  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  is affected by encouraging his driver to drive fast  so\r\n\r\nthat he can make more money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

LTA and Traffic Police are currently studying  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility of putting speed limiting devices to heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe  speed limiter will prevent the vehicle from going beyond  a\r\n\r\nspecified  speed  no  matter how hard the driver  steps  on  the\r\n\r\naccelerator and this will be introduced, if found feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, Sir, I thank Mr Kenneth Chen for his\r\n\r\nsuggestion of requiring retailers to install electronic tags for\r\n\r\ntheir sale items.

These\r\n\r\nthree new hospitals were built at a cost of almost $1.5 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other development projects are also on track. It would seem\r\n\r\nthat  the development programmes outlined in the White Paper  on\r\n\r\nhealthcare, presented in 1993 by the Minister, have largely been\r\n\r\nimplemented.   With  continued  Government  support  on   health\r\n\r\nexpenditures,  the Ministry is well poised to  meet  the  health\r\n\r\nchallenges in the coming millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Minister to comment on the extent to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  targets set out in the White Paper  have  been  met,\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are  any shortfalls and how  does  his  Ministry\r\n\r\npropose to resolve them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of Casemix, Casemix is a system employed to\r\n\r\nestimate  patient bills based on trends and patterns of  certain\r\n\r\ndiseases.  When properly implemented, patients can get a  better\r\n\r\nidea  of  how  much  hospital  treatment  will  cost  them.

I want to comment on one issue which\r\n\r\nis of some interest and, that is, the financing of medical costs\r\n\r\nby  way  of  insurance.  There are existing  insurance  packages\r\n\r\nwhich  cater to various aspects of the healthcare needs  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   However,  it would very much depend  on  the  private\r\n\r\nsector support because, ultimately, the insurance scheme must be\r\n\r\nprofitable for the private sector to take them on.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister in what ways can the Ministry help, through\r\n\r\nvarious  measures, to make it possible for the private  insurers\r\n\r\nto  implement  the  programmes to support  this  very  important\r\n\r\nprogramme on healthcare for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are  about 220,000 elderly people who are  aged   65  and\r\n\r\nabove  now in Singapore. In  30 years' time, the number will  be\r\n\r\ntripled  to  about  800,000, accounting for  about  20%  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation.  This figure does not appear out of the blue.  It is\r\n\r\nthe result of the baby boom just after World War II.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my rough estimate, for the period of 20 years from\r\n\r\n1950  to 1969, more than 1 million people were born.  From  1956\r\n\r\nto  1960, the birth rate was more than 60,000 per year, and  the\r\n\r\ntotal  population of Singapore was only 1.4 million around  that\r\n\r\ntime.  This generation of people are now middle-aged.  In 20  or\r\n\r\n30  years' time, they will enter old age.  Whether it  is  on  a\r\n\r\nnational, social, family or individual  point of view, this is a\r\n\r\nmatter of great concern, because an ageing population is a great\r\n\r\nproblem  to  us, socially and economically. In 20 to  30  years'\r\n\r\ntime, these post-war babies will not only face the problem of an\r\n\r\nageing  population,  but  also a problem  of  less  children  to\r\n\r\nsupport them, because they are the people who have lived through\r\n\r\nthe  age  of very successful family planning, ie, \"boy or  girl,\r\n\r\ntwo is enough\" generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an ageing population, the demand on health care will be\r\n\r\nheavy, and that means medical cost will go up.  So if we do  not\r\n\r\nhandle this problem carefully, 20 to 30 years later, the working\r\n\r\npopulation will have a greater burden on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary folks, the greatest concern is medical cost,\r\n\r\nespecially  after their retirement and as they  enter  old  age,\r\n\r\nmore  medical  and health care will be needed, and hence  bigger\r\n\r\nmedical cost.  The question is whether or not they could  afford\r\n\r\nit.   Will the younger generation be able to support them?  This\r\n\r\nwill  become an emotional problem in due course. I think it will\r\n\r\ndo  us  well  to  start  preparing for measures to  tackle  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  The Government should ensure medicine and health  care\r\n\r\nremain  affordable  to  the  general  public.  Can  we  have  an\r\n\r\nassurance from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report from the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare\r\n\r\nfor   the  Elderly  was  released  recently.   This  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive report and a very important document. One  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  is to provide for a long-term health  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme.   There is a great advantage in this scheme in that  the\r\n\r\ninsurance premium can be deducted from the CPF accounts  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  However, the report does not spell out the details of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis long-term health insurance.  Members of the public may have\r\n\r\ndoubts.   For example, what can the authority do to  help  those\r\n\r\nwho have retired or will be retiring soon, but have not taken up\r\n\r\nthis kind of health insurance?  I hope the Minister can give  us\r\n\r\nmore details on this proposed health insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the population\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is ageing.  One in five Singaporeans will be  aged\r\n\r\n65  and  above in the year 2030.  Medical care and other welfare\r\n\r\nproblems  of the elderly will become a heavy burden to  us.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  all  Singaporeans must give some thought to  this  future\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly\r\n\r\nhas   come   out  with  a  long  list  of  recommendations   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  take  note of.  One  important  recommendation\r\n\r\nurges  the  Ministry of Health to develop a geriatric  screening\r\n\r\nprotocol  to  detect medical problems such as  hypertension  and\r\n\r\ndiabetes very early.  This, I believe, can prevent complications\r\n\r\nand  disability  among  the elderly.  The MOH  should  therefore\r\n\r\nquickly draw up a comprehensive screening programme for citizens\r\n\r\nwho are 55 years and above.  This programme, I believe, must  be\r\n\r\nmade   compulsory  and  should  involve  all  doctors   at   our\r\n\r\npolyclinics  and private GPs all over Singapore.  The  frequency\r\n\r\nof screening can be carried out once a year, and for those above\r\n\r\n65, perhaps they should go for screening twice a year.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important consideration in this programme is the cost of the\r\n\r\nscreening process.  It should be reasonable enough to enable our\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  to afford it.  I am sure with  a  standardised\r\n\r\nhealth  screening, the cost could be as low as possible so  they\r\n\r\ncould reach out to all our senior citizens.  MOH could cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  all our Community Development Councils to share the burden\r\n\r\nof the cost.  I hope that MOH will consider the above points and\r\n\r\nI wish to ask the Minister how soon can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMOH start the screening programme for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): During this time\r\n\r\nof  economic crisis and unstable market conditions, it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  fund-raising activities.  In fact, these organisations  are\r\n\r\nconstantly worrying about how to get the funds needed for  their\r\n\r\nactivities.   I am concerned that activities of these  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations may be paralysed for lack of funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, VWOs which provide convalescence, chronic care\r\n\r\nservices  or  day-care services for the aged enjoy  50%  subsidy\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government.  I would like to urge the  Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  subsidies  for  VWOs,  particularly  those  which\r\n\r\nprovide  health services for the elderly, to, say, 60% of  their\r\n\r\ncost.  In addition, I hope that the Government can also  provide\r\n\r\nland to these VWOs to build their own hospitals or hospices,  at\r\n\r\nconcessionary  prices.   I understand that  in  Hong  Kong,  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  gives  the  land,  free  of  charge,  to   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations to build facilities for the aged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying in Chinese, \"Open up resources and save on\r\n\r\ntheir  outflow.\"  If you can give them more subsidies, that  is,\r\n\r\nmore  resources,  I hope that the Government can  also  consider\r\n\r\nother  measures,  such as the setting up  of  a  task  force  to\r\n\r\nprovide  guidance to these VWOs on how to be more cost-effective\r\n\r\nin  order  to save cost.  Perhaps, the Government could  provide\r\n\r\nthem with cheaper supplies of medicine so as to help them to cut\r\n\r\ncosts.   These voluntary organizations are doing a great job  in\r\n\r\nproviding medical care and support services selflessly  for  the\r\n\r\nchronic  sick  and  aged persons in our society.

It should be promoted vigorously  and  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  targetted  at  everyone.  Today,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  preventive  healthcare for the  elderly.   Sir,  this\r\n\r\nneeds  urgent attention because we face a fast-aging  population\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   It  is  crucial that  the  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nfacilitates the various efforts at helping the elderly  to  stay\r\n\r\nas  healthy  as possible and for as long as possible within  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This  is  the way to reduce the nation's  otherwise\r\n\r\ncolossal  burden  in financing the healthcare  for  its  people.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like  the Ministry of Health to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nfollowing areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) support should be given more readily to community centres,\r\n\r\nvoluntary  group  organisations,  and  grassroots  organisations\r\n\r\ncaring  for the elderly in the community.  The support need  not\r\n\r\nbe  financial  all  the time.  Logistics advice,  deployment  of\r\n\r\navailable   personnel,  loan  of  resources   or   even   simple\r\n\r\nendorsements  of  support may be all  that  is  needed.   Giving\r\n\r\nadvice  on  setting up of Centres of Activity  for  Retired  and\r\n\r\nElderly (CARE), providing paramedics for health screening checks\r\n\r\nand  conducting of educational talks at the community level  are\r\n\r\nsome examples of such help.  The Ministry of Health, acting as a\r\n\r\ncentre  and facilitator to coordinate volunteer doctors, medical\r\n\r\nstudents and nurses, will be able to reach out to more people in\r\n\r\nmore constituencies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the expansion of home-care facilities could be looked into\r\n\r\nmore comprehensively within the Singapore context.  This can  be\r\n\r\nachieved  by  training  more personnel  that  are  relevant  and\r\n\r\ninterested  home-caregivers who look after the sick and  elderly\r\n\r\nat   home.   The  training  of  more  general  practitioners  in\r\n\r\ngeriatrics  would  be  a welcome path to  take.   More  training\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  offered  to  nurses  and  physiotherapists  in\r\n\r\ngeriatrics  medicine.  And even if it is scant, recognition  and\r\n\r\nencouragement  should  be given to volunteers  trained  in  home\r\n\r\nnursing.   They can certainly lessen the load of home-caregivers\r\n\r\nand medical personnel; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the Ministry of Health should look into forming a permanent\r\n\r\nteam  specialising  in the early detection of chronic  illnesses\r\n\r\nand  in the provision of better care of those chronic illnesses.\r\n\r\nAny morbidity and mortality from any disease can be dramatically\r\n\r\nreduced  when the diseases are treated in their earlier  stages.\r\n\r\nIt  is essential that the team be geared to reach the masses  at\r\n\r\nthe local community level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health influences the health matters\r\n\r\nof  the whole population.  Making the right plans and taking the\r\n\r\nright measures can make all the difference in whether our people\r\n\r\nwill be even healthier and happier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to go on to my next cut. I am very glad\r\n\r\nthat some headway has been made in establishing the basic tenets\r\n\r\nof  \"long term healthcare\" for this country.  There is an urgent\r\n\r\nneed for us to look into \"long term healthcare\" from this moment\r\n\r\nin  time  because  neglect in this area could  have  devastating\r\n\r\neffects for us in the future.  I think the report of the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly has given us\r\n\r\na very comprehensive overview of what work is in store for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised in this House, more than once, the issue\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  inadequacy  of  the  present  \"medi-plans\"  for\r\n\r\nelderly  Singaporeans at financing their \"long term healthcare\".\r\n\r\nI  have  also  suggested that perhaps another insurance  scheme,\r\n\r\n\"Medicare\"  -  a patient/Government co-payment scheme, may  fill\r\n\r\nthis  inadequacy.   I  am delighted therefore  that  the  Inter-Ministerial   Committee  on  Healthcare  for  the  Elderly   has\r\n\r\nrecommended an insurance scheme to solve this problem.  However,\r\n\r\nI  would like to ascertain if the scheme, though applicable  for\r\n\r\nthose  with  disability, would be applicable for those  patients\r\n\r\nwho are relatively well, and in fact, only need some help to pay\r\n\r\nfor  outpatient  long term expenses on chronic  diseases.   This\r\n\r\nwill  constitute  a  very  important  proportion  of  long  term\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   Sir,  chronic illnesses will be  a  big  financial\r\n\r\nburden  to the afflicted and it would pose substantial recurring\r\n\r\nexpenditure for them, for instance, to control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndiabetics  and hypertension.  Long term medication  and  regular\r\n\r\nfollow  up  are  necessary to prevent complications  from  these\r\n\r\ndiseases.   It  has been noted that in times of economic  crisis\r\n\r\nlike   this,   patients  have  been  self-reducing   intake   of\r\n\r\nmedications and missing follow ups so as to save costs.  This is\r\n\r\na  hazard  from the lack of means and if this part of long  term\r\n\r\nhealthcare is not eligible for claim, you will defeat the  tenet\r\n\r\nof  your  plans  on  healthcare for the  elderly.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health will clarify on this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad indeed that all the various issues and their\r\n\r\nremedies  on  the  elderly, which I have raised  in  this  House\r\n\r\npreviously,   have   been  addressed  in  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee Report.  I am also very pleased that there is  perfect\r\n\r\nconformity  between my ideas and remedies with this  report.   I\r\n\r\nbeseech  the  MOH  and  the  MCD to hasten  and  to  effectively\r\n\r\nimplement all the recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, surveys in America have shown how\r\n\r\ncritical it is to have a healthy workforce.  According to  these\r\n\r\nsurveys,  more than 60% of all diseases are caused by  lifestyle\r\n\r\nrisks.  Poor dieting habit is associated with leading causes  of\r\n\r\ndeath.   In  general, overweight workers have 30% more  hospital\r\n\r\ndays and 48% more health-care claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are also facing a shift in disease profile\r\n\r\nfrom  the infectious diseases to lifestyle diseases.  The  major\r\n\r\ncauses  of  death in recent years are cancers, stroke and  heart\r\n\r\ndiseases.  These are related to our lifestyle and what  we  eat.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  an  aging workforce is emerging.  The  percentage  of\r\n\r\nworkers in the 40 to 59 years age group has increased from about\r\n\r\n24%  to 35% of the workforce.  Although an older worker need not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be physically less fit or has negative  implication\r\n\r\non  productivity,  we must accept that older  workers  are  more\r\n\r\nprone  to  illnesses.  So, the challenge is to  keep  the  aging\r\n\r\nworkforce  healthy through all kinds of disease preventions  and\r\n\r\nhealth promotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 1997, the annual average days of hospitalisation\r\n\r\nleave  is  10  days per employee and it has been estimated  that\r\n\r\nmore  than  $400  is spent on healthcare for  each  employee  in\r\n\r\nSingapore every year.  This works out to a total of $500 million\r\n\r\nfor  the  Singapore workforce.  The unrestrained, rising  health\r\n\r\ncosts  can adversely affect the competitiveness of our  economy.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  therefore, in the interest of every company to take  an\r\n\r\nactive interest in the health of its employees.  NTUC has  taken\r\n\r\nthe  initiative  to  launch the Workplace  Health  Programme  in\r\n\r\nAugust  last year with the support from the Ministry of  Health,\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council and the NTUC co-operatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Health would allocate more\r\n\r\nresources  to encourage and facilitate private sector management\r\n\r\nto take a preventive approach in dealing with employees' health.\r\n\r\nInstead of just providing healthcare benefits, companies  should\r\n\r\ninvest money in programmes that will help improve their workers'\r\n\r\nhealth, and thus cut healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Roger Smith, the retired CEO of General Motors, as\r\n\r\nquoted in a publication, said that, \"For every $1 we have  spent\r\n\r\non wellness programme, $3 are returned in increased productivity\r\n\r\nover  a  3-year  period.   And  of  course  there  are  dramatic\r\n\r\nreductions in absenteeism and on-the-job accidents.\"  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry conduct a cost and benefit study at our workplaces\r\n\r\nand  devise  some form of incentives such as tax incentives  for\r\n\r\ncompanies with structured Workplace Health Programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, on 1st April 1993,\r\n\r\nthe  Government set up Medifund with an initial contribution  of\r\n\r\n$200  million from the consolidated revenue account.  As at 31st\r\n\r\nMarch  1998, the capital sum of the funds stood at $600 million.\r\n\r\nThe  number of Medifund applications approved in FY97  was  over\r\n\r\n56,000,  amounting  to  more than $13 million.   Medifund  is  a\r\n\r\nsafety  net  for qualifying individuals who cannot afford  their\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost.  The individual Medisave and  those  of  their\r\n\r\nimmediate family\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmembers will be called on first and Medifund is applied  to  the\r\n\r\nshortfall.  Medifund has provided relief to many needy people in\r\n\r\ndealing with their health cost.  I am raising the following as a\r\n\r\nmatter of principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there are cases where family members object\r\n\r\nto  contributing their share, be it cash contribution or the use\r\n\r\nof  their  Medisave.  Very often, they cite that they have  been\r\n\r\nestranged  from the sick member.  I have no doubt that  in  some\r\n\r\ncases,  a  parent may have neglected the child, and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  child begrudged being called upon for assistance.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a serious family fall out.  Whatever the reasons\r\n\r\ngiven,  I  am questioning whether it is then right to leave  the\r\n\r\nburden  to the other taxpayers to carry.  It is my premise  that\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be  right. In times of need, family  members  should\r\n\r\nrally  round  and forget the past.  If one cannot forgive  one's\r\n\r\nown  family member, who else can one forgive?  In some cases,  a\r\n\r\nfamily member who refuses to help out is also the wealthiest  in\r\n\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be a practical solution to suggest that family\r\n\r\nmembers  bring the matter to the Family Tribunal.   The  process\r\n\r\ncan  be  protracted and painful.  I suggest  that  at  the  very\r\n\r\nleast,  the  contribution  from the  Medisave  accounts  of  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  family  members should be made an  automatic  process\r\n\r\nthrough legislation.  This way, the burden of family members who\r\n\r\nchip  in  with  the cash payments would be lessened,  and  where\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money is used, at least we know that  all  immediate\r\n\r\nfamily  members  of  the individual to  be  helped  had  made  a\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am specifically requesting\r\n\r\nfor  help  in  providing dental care and treatment for  children\r\n\r\nwith cerebral palsy.  The main concerns are that most public and\r\n\r\nprivate  dentists and oral surgeons are not equipped  to  handle\r\n\r\ndifficult cerebral palsy clients who are unable to control their\r\n\r\ninvoluntary  movements, or drooling.  And getting  them  to  sit\r\n\r\nstill is the greatest challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no awareness among graduates about the needs of\r\n\r\ndental care for the cerebral palsy, because their courses do not\r\n\r\ninclude  this  area  of  treatment.   There  is  a  need  for  a\r\n\r\ndesignated  dental service in the community which  the  cerebral\r\n\r\npalsy  can  visit  as  part of our healthcare  benefit  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  And there is a need to expose dental students  to\r\n\r\nhandling, in practice, more difficult cases of treatment for the\r\n\r\ndisabled  in a designated hospital facility, so that  eventually\r\n\r\nwhen  they set up their own clinics, they will accept and  treat\r\n\r\nsuch  clients.   There  is a greater need  to  provide  free  or\r\n\r\nsubsidised   dental  treatment  to  clients  who  are   severely\r\n\r\ndisabled, like the cerebral palsy.  Currently, only clients from\r\n\r\nMINDS benefit from free dental treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spastic Children's Association of Singapore is the primary\r\n\r\nadvocate for more help to be extended to the disabled.   It  has\r\n\r\n240  schoolers, 60 adult trainees and workshops,  and  55  adult\r\n\r\nmembers.  If the Association sets up a dental clinic of its own,\r\n\r\nit  needs  resources  and  a  pool  of  volunteers  like  dental\r\n\r\npersonnel.  The critical factor here, however, is where can they\r\n\r\neven  get  to start a programme with volunteer dental  personnel\r\n\r\nwho know how to treat the spastics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital is still the most practical venue to cater to the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the disabled.  I propose that we start by identifying\r\n\r\ndental graduates who are interested in this area of treatment to\r\n\r\nrun a Government-sponsored programme in NUH or SGH.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are merely reinforcing one additional aspect of care\r\n\r\nwithin  the existing medical infrastructure, very little capital\r\n\r\nand  operating costs are needed.  I feel that this is  the  most\r\n\r\ncost-effective measure.  As it is only a small number of  people\r\n\r\nwho  will  need the service, it will not be an excessive  burden\r\n\r\nover  the  current case load of dental personnel.  What  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  reinforce is a group of paramedics or  trained  dental\r\n\r\nassistants  who can prepare patients beforehand, and  administer\r\n\r\nsedation,  if  necessary,  before  the  doctor  attends  to  the\r\n\r\npatient.  What we need more is to promote a positive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattitude towards the medical needs of the disabled.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singapore has a growing reputation as a hub of\r\n\r\nmedical  excellence  in the region.  This  did  not  come  about\r\n\r\nthrough  chance.  This came about through the high  professional\r\n\r\nstandards  maintained  and provided by a  pool  of  well-trained\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  healthcare  workers.  We will  need  a  continuous\r\n\r\nstream  of junior doctors coming on in succession.   To get  top\r\n\r\nnotch  doctors, we need training for these juniors.  Conversely,\r\n\r\nthese  juniors need the training to move on career  wise.   They\r\n\r\nare  usually bonded.  They are often over worked, and  they  are\r\n\r\nperhaps  underpaid.  Most of all, they have little or no  choice\r\n\r\nbut  simply  to get through with their stint in public  service.\r\n\r\nThis  may cause loss of morale among the junior doctors.  I feel\r\n\r\nstrongly that for the junior doctors to give of their best,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health must first have their welfare at heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to highlight the unhappiness of many junior\r\n\r\ndoctors  concerning their employment benefits, especially  their\r\n\r\nbasic medical benefits.  Sir, a medical officer was admitted  to\r\n\r\nhospital in March 1997, suspected of foreign body ingestion.  He\r\n\r\nwas found to have pulmonary tuberculosis.  He stayed for a total\r\n\r\nof  seven  days in B2 Class and had to pay $1,496.08.  It  would\r\n\r\nhave  been $4,539.50 if he had chosen an unsubsidised ward.   He\r\n\r\nhad  to pay the entire bill like any other patient, and only the\r\n\r\nsurgeon's  fees  were  waived, but not the  anesthetist's  fees.\r\n\r\nDuring  this period, he was working as a medical officer in  the\r\n\r\nsame  hospital.  It is possible that he contracted  tuberculosis\r\n\r\nfrom  his  patients.   The point here is that he felt that  some\r\n\r\nform  of professional courtesy, like what the surgeon had, would\r\n\r\nhave been extended to him for being a staff of the hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another medical officer was admitted in November 1997 for gastro-enteritis which he had apparently contracted during his night\r\n\r\nduty.  He had to pay $1,233.67 for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfour  days  of  stay.   Again,  no  professional  courtesy   was\r\n\r\nexercised by the hospital he was working in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aforesaid were two cases of many more similar situations\r\n\r\nfaced  by  junior doctors.  Employers are morally law  bound  to\r\n\r\nmedically  cover  occupational mishaps and disabilities  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  work.  It is imperative that the healthcare sector  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  an  exception.  In many other industries, the employees\r\n\r\nreceive services from within the industry they work in, often as\r\n\r\npart of the benefits.  Doctors and healthcare workers should  be\r\n\r\ngiven the same privilege.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doctors are exposed to a vast array of health hazards, such\r\n\r\nas  infectious diseases, in the course of their duties.  Medical\r\n\r\nbenefits for medical practioners in the civil service have  been\r\n\r\npegged  to  the  level  of other civil  servants  that  are  not\r\n\r\nsimilarly at risk.  Many doctors feel that as they are  more  at\r\n\r\nrisk,  they  should  be better covered for  these  risks.   Many\r\n\r\ndoctors  also felt that the mechanism for their medical benefits\r\n\r\nwas not apparent to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Ministry of Health intends to have the welfare of\r\n\r\njunior  doctors adequately looked after.  Sir, this is one  area\r\n\r\nrequiring some adjustments by the Ministry.  The perpetuation of\r\n\r\nthe  aforementioned  incidents and  the  negative  publicity  it\r\n\r\nreceived  is  unhealthy.  It is detrimental for  the  morale  of\r\n\r\njunior  doctors  and  deleterious to  public  opinion  upon  the\r\n\r\nhospital  and the Ministry.   The Ministry should set  the  pace\r\n\r\nand  show itself as a responsible and caring employer.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis reasonable and appropriate that they provide medical coverage\r\n\r\nto  healthcare  workers more susceptible to contacting  diseases\r\n\r\nwhile working.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, the Report of the Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee   on  Healthcare  for  the  Elderly  has   made   many\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  However, I notice that there was no mention of\r\n\r\nan  institution  to spearhead these recommendations.   So  I  am\r\n\r\nasking  the  Minister  to  consider  whether  the  Home  Nursing\r\n\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncould  be  used  as  the  institution  to  spearhead  all  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  Of course, we need to upgrade the institution.\r\n\r\nWe  need to give it higher stature, responsibility, function, to\r\n\r\noversee  and  initiate the many health programmes and  services,\r\n\r\nnot  only  for  the  elderly but also for  other  modalities  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the services that the Home Nursing Foundation could\r\n\r\nembark  on?  I would include rehabilitation programmes,  chronic\r\n\r\nillness  management,  health  maintenance,  home  care,   health\r\n\r\neducation  at community level.  And what are the target  groups?\r\n\r\nThe  target groups are the recently discharged hospital patients\r\n\r\nfor   continual  rehabilitation  programmes  complementing   the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  chronic  disease patient management  like  diabetes,\r\n\r\nstrokes,  some  spinal problems, hypertension, asthmatics,  etc.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  other  area they should take care, of course,  is  the\r\n\r\nsenior citizens on the health maintenance programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we do it? I would like to make a suggestion. I think to\r\n\r\nget  it  better  organised and spearhead all the recommendations\r\n\r\nthe  Committee has made, we could set up what I call a community\r\n\r\nhealth  services centre.  We could set up these centres  between\r\n\r\nthe  Home  Nursing Foundation and CDCs.  These community  health\r\n\r\nservices centres would provide the following modalities of  care\r\n\r\n-   home  care  services, community care services which  include\r\n\r\ncoordinating  the  many  health  service  providers   like   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  hospitals, outpatient clinics, general  practitioners\r\n\r\nand  a group of what I call the allied health care organisations\r\n\r\nlike  the  diabetic society, the renal society, cardiac  society\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  It could also serve as an information and advisory\r\n\r\ncentre  on  health  problems.  And,  of  course,  it  should  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the health maintenance programmes and also  health\r\n\r\nscreening.  We have to determine the number of such centres.   I\r\n\r\nthink  they  should preferably be distributed evenly  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  island,  perhaps  around eight centres.   I  am  only  just\r\n\r\nmentioning  this number.  It could be more. A few  CDCs  may  be\r\n\r\ninvolved   in   one  centre  together  with  the  Home   Nursing\r\n\r\nFoundation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proper study, of course, needs to be made on the location of\r\n\r\nsuch  centres and whether it will be a stand-alone  building  or\r\n\r\nwhether  we could tie up with some very well equipped  community\r\n\r\ncentres  like  mine.  To do all these, I suggest that  the  Home\r\n\r\nNursing Foundation be considered seriously as the institution to\r\n\r\norganise and manage the care of the elderly.  Of course, we need\r\n\r\nproper  funding and manpower should be provided.  It is  only  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion.   I  do  hope  that  the  Minister  will  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration what I have just said.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, the Report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly is\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and promising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acute help is offered by our hospitals and I am glad to learn\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry is incrementally creating more beds  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith rising numbers of our aging population.  By the early years\r\n\r\nof  the  new  millennium, our forecast needs will  be  met.   We\r\n\r\nalready  have a number of homes  for the aged.  The Home Nursing\r\n\r\nFoundation  alone  operates  12 centres  to  offer  a  range  of\r\n\r\nservices to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more concerned, however, by what follows after the patients\r\n\r\nare  discharged from institutional care.  In fact, hospitals are\r\n\r\nfacing  resistance in discharging elderly patients who  are  not\r\n\r\ntoo  ambulant  but not sick enough to stay in hospital,  as  the\r\n\r\nfamilies do not know how to take care of them at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the growing demographic trends, this deserves serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I would like to focus on two aspects:  first, in\r\n\r\ntraining  home-carers on how to care for the frail elderly  more\r\n\r\neffectively  and,  second, developing nursing  and  para-nursing\r\n\r\nservices  that  can be sold to private homes  on  principles  of\r\n\r\naffordability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, focus on homecare. What are the critical challenges?\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  may  ask by asking: who takes care?   Primarily  the\r\n\r\nwife,   daughter   and   mother,  with   lower   and   declining\r\n\r\nparticipation, from the husband, daughter-in-law  and  the  son,\r\n\r\naccording to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  Singapore Survey in 1995.  Conversely, daughters, as  carers,\r\n\r\nhave increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, care-giving role is adversely affecting care-givers who\r\n\r\nfeel  the  physical  and  psychological  strain  caused  by  the\r\n\r\nnecessity of constant engagement, thus restricting personal life\r\n\r\nand  increasing financial burdens.  The situation  is  obviously\r\n\r\nworse  if care-givers also have to work to support the  rest  of\r\n\r\nthe household needs.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third challenge is home-care is evidently the cheapest\r\n\r\nway of solving the problems of long term care, but this may mean\r\n\r\ndepriving  carers, in particular daughters, the  chance  to  re-enter the labour force or take over extra-familial roles in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Some longitudinal research has shown  that  \"family\r\n\r\ncentred\"  women  deteriorate earlier and actually  experience  a\r\n\r\nlower degree of quality of life in old age.  We lose out both at\r\n\r\nthe labour front and the home front.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth challenge is what if the elderly has no children\r\n\r\nto  do the caring?  Or what if the elderly prefer to live alone?\r\n\r\nOr  live  in a home for the aged?  The trend towards independent\r\n\r\nliving  is  increasingly  apparent in a  more  educated  greying\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last challenge is that there are real problems when old\r\n\r\nparents  are often angry, bad-tempered, grumbling and  difficult\r\n\r\nto manage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these challenges, what services, skills package and\r\n\r\ninformation  are  available now to provide support  networks  to\r\n\r\nhelp  these  carers  cope?   Are they  adequate  in  offering  a\r\n\r\ndifferentiated support system for the elderly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that instead of looking for more buildings and\r\n\r\nday care centres, we may want to creatively look deeper into the\r\n\r\ncommunity and tap its embedded resources to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where I think CDCs, Women's Wing, Women's Executive\r\n\r\nCommittees   and  NTUC  cooperative  movement,  Family   Service\r\n\r\nCentres,  hospitals and medical consultants,  volunteer  medical\r\n\r\nteams  and neighbourhood clinics could work out a Nursing  Focus\r\n\r\nPlan  to  identify the needs of each neighbourhood  and  develop\r\n\r\nsmall  scale,  efficient and effective programmes at  the  local\r\n\r\nlevel  to  promote collaborative, self-organising  networks.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  spirit  and orientation of such a  service  is  very\r\n\r\nsimilar to what Dr Tan Cheng Bock earlier mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second focus is on developing nursing and para-nursing\r\n\r\nservices.   I feel we have not sufficiently utilised the  skills\r\n\r\nand  capabilities of the Nursing Association network and retired\r\n\r\nnurses  as  well  as homemakers, who may be like part-time  paid\r\n\r\njobs,  be  trained as para-nurses to care for the frail elderly.\r\n\r\nTheir paid service will  be a positive relief for carers who can\r\n\r\nthen leave the homes and do their own thing for a few hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use CDC or a neighbourhood polyclinic as a base. We\r\n\r\nthen  identify  the  medical skills level  in  the  constituency\r\n\r\nthrough the Nursing Association.  Trained nurses and consultants\r\n\r\ncan  serve  as  leaders  to train a network  of  para-nurses  to\r\n\r\nrespond to home calls.  It is like the insurance business  which\r\n\r\nhas  a lead agent with a network of understudying trainees.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry will then set guidelines on payment schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming increasingly problematic to rely on\r\n\r\nfamily care as the only and best solution for caring for an aged\r\n\r\nperson.   We have to complement this initiative by strengthening\r\n\r\nhome  care  and  nursing service as a para-professional  service\r\n\r\nwhich  can be offered by paid agents who are not family members.\r\n\r\nWhile  this  is  already happening in a  small  segment  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   which  can  afford  such  service  from  private-run\r\n\r\noperations,  I  am calling for a community-based  initiative  at\r\n\r\neach  constituency to make healthcare a localised and affordable\r\n\r\ncommunity  service,  with appropriate level  of  regulation  and\r\n\r\nquality control from the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, several Members have indicated their\r\n\r\ninterest  in what I have to say on this amendment.  I hope  they\r\n\r\nare not disappointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr Tham who runs a hair clinic came to my meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession  several times relating the problems he has  encountered\r\n\r\nin conducting his hair transplant business.  His hair transplant\r\n\r\nprocess  involves re-inserting hair follicles removed  elsewhere\r\n\r\none   at  a  time.   His  clinic  employs  medical  doctors  and\r\n\r\nspecialists  who were trained in the specialty  clinics  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.  I do not know about the effect of his operation,\r\n\r\nbut  he has a  long list of clients from Singapore and the Asia-Pacific  region.   His business seems like a  sun-rise  industry\r\n\r\nwith good demand, and good return on investment.  It also has  a\r\n\r\n\"feel-good\"  effect on the customers.  Not everyone  can  handle\r\n\r\nhair loss with the grace and dignity as some notable Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the risk of infections and complications, hair\r\n\r\ntransplant   operation  of  this  nature  should  be  regulated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this Mr Tham seems to run into regulatory entanglements\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry  of  Health, such  as  the  suitability  and\r\n\r\ncertification of doctors involved.  Furthermore, when  he  tried\r\n\r\nto  put  up  an advertisement, he could not use the words  \"hair\r\n\r\ntransplant\" in the advertisement, but the words \"hair  services\"\r\n\r\nwhich could mean anything actually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me hasten to add that that I am not bringing this\r\n\r\nmatter up on behalf of Mr Tham.  But through the interaction,  I\r\n\r\nbecame  interested to find out how the Ministry of Health  views\r\n\r\nhair  transplant  as  an economic activity.   Is  it  a  medical\r\n\r\noperation,  cosmetic  service or plastic surgery?   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nare  the  doctors  involved subject to  the  regulation  of  the\r\n\r\nMedical Registration Act?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Let  me  first reply to the  points  made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nBernard Chen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on Affordable Healthcare identified\r\n\r\nfour strategies to ensure that healthcare remains affordable:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to maintain a basic medical care package which all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can have access to;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to regulate the supply and type of doctors and\r\n\r\nhospitals;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) support for medical R&D, education and training; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) have sound healthcare financing policies to support\r\n\r\nthe objectives laid out in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry took stock of the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper recommendations.  I am happy to inform  Members\r\n\r\nthat at the time of the stock take, most of the targets, as  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  White  Paper,  have  already  been  met.   Let  me\r\n\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MOH has maintained the basic medical care package, we\r\n\r\nalso  regularly  review  the package to take  into  account  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies and treatment procedures.  We have also taken steps\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the regulatory role of the Ministry and  reviewed\r\n\r\nour legislation and policies to ensure that we continue to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaintain a high standard of medical care and medical practice in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The White Paper had recommended the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nkey national medical centres.  I am happy to report the National\r\n\r\nCentres  for Skin, Eye and Heart are already operational,  while\r\n\r\nthe  remaining two, the National Cancer Centre and the  National\r\n\r\nNeuroscience Institute, will begin operations this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of research, MOH established the National\r\n\r\nMedical Research Council in December 1993, and we have allocated\r\n\r\n$280  million  to fund medical research for the period  FY94  to\r\n\r\nFY2001.  So far the research interest and results have been very\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining key recommendation that has yet to be fully\r\n\r\nimplemented  is  Casemix  which is an  important  tool  to  help\r\n\r\ncontain  future increases in healthcare costs and  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  enhance quality of care.  MOH will introduce  the  Casemix\r\n\r\nsystem  in  all  public hospitals by the end of this  year.   We\r\n\r\nwill,  within the next three to five years, expand  the  Casemix\r\n\r\nsystem to private sector hospitals to control charges by private\r\n\r\ndoctors  and hospitals to patients who use Medisave to help  pay\r\n\r\npart  of  their  medical  bills.  So with  the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nCasemix, all the key elements contained in the White Paper would\r\n\r\nhave been implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the points raised by Mr Chen on Casemix\r\n\r\nitself.   Sir,  let  me take this opportunity to  first  briefly\r\n\r\nexplain  to  Members what is Casemix.  Casemix is a system  that\r\n\r\nallows  hospitals to group patients according to  their  medical\r\n\r\nconditions  and  the level of resources needed  to  treat  them.\r\n\r\nCasemix  offers two important benefits: firstly, it will  enable\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  to  better  understand  and  better  manage  the\r\n\r\nresources  needed for a particular medical condition;  secondly,\r\n\r\nit  will encourage performance monitoring, benchmarking and best\r\n\r\npractices, leading to better quality of care of our patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Casemix, as mentioned by Mr Chen, was piloted\r\n\r\nat  two sites in May last year.  This was extended to cover  the\r\n\r\nremaining Government-owned acute hospitals six months  later  in\r\n\r\nOctober  1998.   All the hospitals now have systems  to  capture\r\n\r\ninformation  required under Casemix.  By the end of  this  year,\r\n\r\nthese  hospitals will receive subvention based on Casemix.   And\r\n\r\nthe  Government will fund the public sector hospitals  according\r\n\r\nto  the  number of patients treated in each Casemix category  or\r\n\r\nthe  technical  term which is used is Diagnosis  Related  Groups\r\n\r\n(DRG).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Government White Paper on Affordable Health Care, Casemix\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned  as  one mechanism that can be  used  to  control\r\n\r\nbalance billing in private hospitals.  Casemix information  will\r\n\r\nenable  us  to  set  the  limit on the total  amount  a  private\r\n\r\nhospital can bill a patient for a particular DRG if he is  using\r\n\r\nMedisave to pay for part of his hospital bill.  This limit  will\r\n\r\nbe  regardless  of  the length of stay, the  type  of  tests  or\r\n\r\nmedications  ordered.  The control of balance  billing  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented in three to five years' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has already started to engage the private sector in\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  We will encourage and help the private  sector  to\r\n\r\nactively pursue the use of Casemix.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have spoken on issues related to the\r\n\r\nelderly  and  the  Report  that  was  released  by  the   Inter-Ministerial Committee on the healthcare needs of the elderly.  I\r\n\r\nwill  take  them  altogether and address them according  to  the\r\n\r\nissues.   First,  let me thank Members who have expressed  their\r\n\r\nviews  and concerns on the Report of the IMC and also for  their\r\n\r\nstrong  support.  As many have stated, Singapore  faces  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  challenge in the 21st century as a result of the  rapid\r\n\r\nageing of our population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Goh Choon Kang mentioned, the number of elderly persons\r\n\r\nabove  the  age  of  65 will climb from 225,000  today  to  over\r\n\r\n800,000 by the Year 2030.  Clearly, a four-fold increase in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of elderly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersons  in  our  society over the next  30  years  will  impose\r\n\r\nimmense  pressures  on the healthcare system.   We  must,  as  a\r\n\r\nnation,  start  preparing now for the transition.   We  must  be\r\n\r\nproactive  and  anticipate,  plan  and  phase  in  the  critical\r\n\r\nnational health infrastructure and services over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC has recommended a two-pronged approach to look after the\r\n\r\nhealthcare needs of the elderly.  Firstly, health promotion  and\r\n\r\ndisease  prevention  to  enhance  the  health  of  the  elderly.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the provision of adequate, appropriate and affordable\r\n\r\nservices  for the elderly who require long-term care.  The  main\r\n\r\nstrategy  to meet the healthcare needs of the elderly  obviously\r\n\r\nis  to  avoid disease and disabilities through life long  health\r\n\r\npromotion and disease prevention.  Healthy elderly persons  will\r\n\r\nthen  remain  happy,  active  and  productive  members  of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This approach will also shorten the period  of  ill\r\n\r\nhealth  and  reduce  the  need to institutionalise  the  elderly\r\n\r\nwhenever they fall ill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that my Ministry should work closely\r\n\r\nwith and support voluntary and grassroots organisations that are\r\n\r\ninterested in conducting educational talks and health screenings\r\n\r\nfor  the  community.  Sir, I can assure her that we  are  indeed\r\n\r\ndoing  so  in the area of educational talks but, nonetheless,  I\r\n\r\nshall ask my officials to look into her suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of healthcare screening, Mr Ibrahim Othman and Dr Lily\r\n\r\nNeo  touched  on  that.  Let me reply to them now.   Mr  Ibrahim\r\n\r\nOthman  stated  that  MOH  should draw up  quickly  a  screening\r\n\r\nprogramme for the elderly and should make it compulsory and have\r\n\r\nit  done yearly.  When they get a little bit older, it should be\r\n\r\ndone  twice  yearly and it should be cost effective.   The  cost\r\n\r\nshould be reasonable and affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the IMC has recommended that the elderly should undergo\r\n\r\nregular  medical screening that allows medical  problems  to  be\r\n\r\ndetected  and  treated early.  This would then  improve  patient\r\n\r\ncare and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduce  the risk of serious complications and disabilities.   To\r\n\r\nachieve  this objective, my Ministry has developed a simple  10-minute  geriatric health screening protocol.  This  protocol  is\r\n\r\nmeant  to  pick  up early symptoms and signs of common  diseases\r\n\r\nsuch  as  high  blood  pressure, diabetes,  visual  and  hearing\r\n\r\nimpairment, other functional and mental problems in the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screening protocol is being validated currently and, once it\r\n\r\nis  validated, we will give it to the GPs and polyclinic doctors\r\n\r\nto  administer to elderly patients.  Mr Ibrahim Othman said that\r\n\r\nthis  should be made compulsory.  Sir, we should not make health\r\n\r\nscreening  compulsory.   It  should  be  a  voluntary  programme\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is  in line with the Government's  philosophy  of\r\n\r\nindividual  responsibility.   We will  educate  the  individuals\r\n\r\nthrough the mass media and the community organisations about the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  health  screening.  We hope  that,  through  the\r\n\r\norganisations at the grassroots level and the VWOs, we will have\r\n\r\na  pretty  good  outreach.  We expect the cost to be  affordable\r\n\r\nbecause the screening would be simple, low cost and it takes  10\r\n\r\nminutes.  My officials are now in the process of identifying and\r\n\r\ntraining  service providers to administer the screening  and  to\r\n\r\ndecide on the appropriate frequency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo raised the question of MOH supporting community health\r\n\r\nscreenings.  Sir, I feel it will be better for the organisers to\r\n\r\nrely not just on MOH, but to reach out and involve GPs and other\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers and workers that are working in  the  area.\r\n\r\nThis  is because there are a lot more GPs and healthcare workers\r\n\r\nin the private sector than in the public sector and many of them\r\n\r\nwould  be  happy, I am sure, to strengthen their links with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity in which they serve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on home care. Mdm Claire Chiang stressed the\r\n\r\nneed for us to tap on the community and that there is a need for\r\n\r\nus  to  provide greater support to home carers.  Sir, I  totally\r\n\r\nagree  with her.  We do indeed ensure that there is an  adequate\r\n\r\nsupport for home carers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  the burden on the family members who are providing  the\r\n\r\ncare  is  actually  quite great.  In keeping with  our  societal\r\n\r\nvalues  and norms, our philosophy is that the elderly, even  the\r\n\r\ndisabled  ones,  should  as far as possible  remain  with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies    and   stay   within   the   community,    and    the\r\n\r\ninstitutionalisation of the elderly should only be  the  measure\r\n\r\nof  last  resort  and not the first resort.   We  are  therefore\r\n\r\ntaking  various steps to enhance home care and to alleviate  the\r\n\r\nburden being borne by family care givers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the type of home care services that we are\r\n\r\nproviding to support the home carers.  The first is home nursing\r\n\r\ncare.   The nurses from the VWOs, who provide this home  nursing\r\n\r\ncare,  visit  the elderly at home to provide such nursing  care,\r\n\r\nlike  wound dressing and teaching the elderly sick and the  care\r\n\r\ngivers  simple  exercises to improve their  health  and  fitness\r\n\r\nlevels.  The second is home medical care where doctors visit the\r\n\r\nelderly  sick  at home to provide treatment and follow-up  care.\r\n\r\nThe third is home-help where home helpers make visits to deliver\r\n\r\nmeals and provide respite care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these three categories of home care services will be an\r\n\r\nimportant support for family care givers.  My Ministry will work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  MCD to identify and encourage more  VWOs  to  get\r\n\r\ninvolved and to assist and nurture them.  We will also work with\r\n\r\nthe grassroots organisations and the professional organisations,\r\n\r\nlike the nursing association and others, to identify people  who\r\n\r\nare  interested in such  a service and identify who can  be  the\r\n\r\nkey  leaders in each area and help them drive the process.  This\r\n\r\nis  a nation-wide requirement and the more helping hands we  can\r\n\r\nget,  the  more  effectively we can help the home  care  givers.\r\n\r\nSir, I totally agree with Mdm Chiang and we would definitely  be\r\n\r\nworking in that direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to healthcare financing. Mr Bernard Chen asked\r\n\r\nhow we are going to get the private insurers to get involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  provision of long-term care insurance.  And  Mr  Goh  Choon\r\n\r\nKang, on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, asked in view of the likelihood that healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts  will continue to go up, how we would help the elderly  to\r\n\r\npay  for  their healthcare needs in the future, how do  we  help\r\n\r\nthose  who presently need such care and who may not be  able  to\r\n\r\nhave  access to the long-term care insurance and how do we  help\r\n\r\nthem  to pay for such services.  Sir, because our population  is\r\n\r\nrelatively young now, this is the right time to put in  place  a\r\n\r\nproper framework for financing healthcare.  That is why we  have\r\n\r\ncome  up  with this solution of long-term care insurance because\r\n\r\nthis  would enable individuals to start paying the premiums  now\r\n\r\nin  anticipation of 20 or 30 years' time when they get  old  and\r\n\r\nmay need long-term care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that the cost of long-term care, especially\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised  long-term  care  for  the  elderly  who   are\r\n\r\nseverely  disabled and will require extensive  support,  can  be\r\n\r\nquite  expensive.   At present, some of you may  know  that  the\r\n\r\npatients  or  the elderly with household income  of  $2,000  and\r\n\r\nbelow  qualify  for subsidies in the VWO homes.  Those  families\r\n\r\nwith  household  income  above that  level  are  unable  to  get\r\n\r\nsubsidies.  We have had quite a fair bit of feedback  that  many\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  the  lower middle income groups do  find  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   bear   the  full  fees.    Arising   from   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the LTC, the Government has agreed to  extend\r\n\r\nsuch  subsidies  to families in the lower middle income  groups.\r\n\r\nWe  will  need to have a means test to identify who will qualify\r\n\r\nfor  such  subsidies  and my Ministry is  now  working  out  the\r\n\r\ndetails  on where is the cut-off income level.  In reply  to  Mr\r\n\r\nGoh  Choon  Kang,  those families who are in  the  lower  middle\r\n\r\nincome  groups  today  will  be able  to  have  access  to  some\r\n\r\nsubsidies once my officials have finalised their studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of getting the private sector to be involved, our\r\n\r\naim  is  that  the Government, through CPF and  MOH,  will  only\r\n\r\nlaunch one basic long-term care insurance plan.  For this  plan,\r\n\r\nthe  premium  will be kept low and affordable and the  benefits,\r\n\r\nalthough they will not be very large, will still be adequate for\r\n\r\nthe lower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmiddle  income and lower income families.  Because, in addition,\r\n\r\nto  the cash benefits from the insurance payment, they will also\r\n\r\nhave  access  to, firstly, Government subsidies,  and  secondly,\r\n\r\nfinancial  support from the VWOs.  With these three  components,\r\n\r\nthe cash outlay required from those families will be affordable.\r\n\r\nThis means that since we are only providing the basic insurance,\r\n\r\nwe will need the private insurers to come in to provide enhanced\r\n\r\nplans.   This  is very similar to the MediShield approach  where\r\n\r\nCPF  provides a fairly basic MediShield package and the  private\r\n\r\ninsurers provide the enhanced package.  To make it possible  for\r\n\r\nthe private insurers to participate, we will also be prepared to\r\n\r\nextend the use of Medisave to pay for the premiums.  The details\r\n\r\nare now being worked out between my Ministry and the CPF Board.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether the long-term care insurance will also\r\n\r\npay  for  the  treatment of chronic diseases like  diabetes  and\r\n\r\nhypertension.  The long-term care insurance would only cover the\r\n\r\ncare provided by the elderly with serious disabilities and would\r\n\r\ntherefore require extensive care from care-givers, whether it is\r\n\r\nat  home  or  in  institutions.  These severe  disabilities  are\r\n\r\nusually fairly long-lasting or prolonged, if not permanent,  and\r\n\r\ncan  therefore be very costly for the family to manage,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  living at home or in the institution.  The  costs  of\r\n\r\nmedication   for   chronic   conditions   like   diabetics   and\r\n\r\nhypertension are generally affordable and I think most  families\r\n\r\nare  able  to pay for them out of pocket.  For those who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford the medications from the private sector, they have access\r\n\r\nto   the  polyclinics  where  heavily  subsidised  services  are\r\n\r\navailable.  The normal subsidy is 50% at the polyclinic and  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly above the age of 65, they get another 50% discount.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  actual fact, for the elderly, the subsidy is more,  in\r\n\r\nthe range of 75%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the key thing is to remember that the aim is to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  premiums for the long-term care insurance as  low  as\r\n\r\npossible and that means having as tight a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncoverage  as  possible, rather than as wide a coverage,  because\r\n\r\nthe  wider  the coverage, the greater the coverage,  the  higher\r\n\r\nwould  be  the premiums required and this would be  contrary  to\r\n\r\nwhat we are trying to achieve, which is to keep the premiums low\r\n\r\nand affordable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang talked about the role of the VWOs and\r\n\r\nasked  for a review of the subsidies.  I agree with Mr Yeo about\r\n\r\nthe  role of the VWOs.  We too value their role because they are\r\n\r\nable  to perform a very difficult job with great compassion  and\r\n\r\nwith  great commitment and, therefore, we should try to make  it\r\n\r\nas  easy as possible for them, without getting them involved, in\r\n\r\njust  doing fund-raising full-time, which I think, some of  them\r\n\r\nare doing.  But at the same time, we have to make sure that they\r\n\r\nare  being run efficiently, so that with the subsidies  we  give\r\n\r\nthem,  they  are  able to operate without having  to  raise  too\r\n\r\nextensive the amount of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that in Hong Kong the land is given to them for free.\r\n\r\nSir, I want to let him know that in Singapore, this is also  the\r\n\r\ncase.   We  charge them a Temporary Occupation Licence  or  TOL.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is  a  paper transaction because  the  TOL  is  fully\r\n\r\nsubsidised  by the Ministry.  So, in effect, they get  the  land\r\n\r\nfor free.  Not only that, we provide them with a grant that pays\r\n\r\nfor 90% of the cost of the building, so the amount they have  to\r\n\r\nactually raise is quite low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think what is a burden on them is the need to raise funds\r\n\r\nfor  the recurring expenses since we only subsidise 50%.  And  I\r\n\r\nam  happy  to inform Mr Yeo that we are actually reviewing  that\r\n\r\ntoo.   The  aim  is that we should make sure that, firstly,  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  are increased, so that their burden is lessened,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly,  to widen the coverage.  And as I mentioned just  now,\r\n\r\nwe are going to increase the coverage from just the lower income\r\n\r\ngroups  to the lower middle income groups, and I think it  would\r\n\r\nmake the burden on the VWOs a lot lighter.  We are reviewing  it\r\n\r\ntogether  with MCD and we hope to finish the review  within  the\r\n\r\nnext six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock suggested that for the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe   LTC   report,  we  have  an  institution  to   drive   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations and that we should expand the role  of  the  HNF\r\n\r\nand  utilise  the  CDCs  and other community  organisations  and\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations to help drive the implementation.   The\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee cover a  very\r\n\r\nwide  spectrum  of  areas  from  preventive  healthcare,  health\r\n\r\neducation, health screening, community-based services, including\r\n\r\nhome  nursing to the setting up of physical structures - nursing\r\n\r\nhomes,  community hospitals, the whole lot.  It  really  is  the\r\n\r\nwork of a Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my Ministry will continue to drive the implementation of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations but we will do that in close collaboration  with\r\n\r\nthe   VWOs  because  we  are  not  the  ones  who  are  actually\r\n\r\nimplementing.   The VWOs will have to come in  and  provide  the\r\n\r\nservices and provide some of the training and we will be at  the\r\n\r\nback helping them, but making sure that where there are gaps, we\r\n\r\nare  able  to  quickly  identify new  VWOs  or  maybe  encourage\r\n\r\nexisting VWOs to fill the gaps.  And we may, later on,  set  up,\r\n\r\nin certain areas, coordinating groups or ensure that there is  a\r\n\r\nleader  for some of those programmes.  So, it is mid-way between\r\n\r\nwhat  you have proposed and what we are actually doing.  He  has\r\n\r\nasked  for  us  to make use of the CDCs.  Sir,  indeed,  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking  into that and would like to work as closely as possible\r\n\r\nwith the CDCs down the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have replied to most of the points which I am\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have replied to.  I will now ask Dr Aline  Wong  to\r\n\r\nanswer the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline Wong):\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to address the points raised by Mr Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang.   I  think he made a case for the Ministry  to  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  workplace  health promotion programmes.   Indeed,  we  put\r\n\r\nquite   a   bit  of  emphasis  on  promoting  healthy  lifestyle\r\n\r\nprogrammes at the workplace.  As early as 1988, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalready  formed  a Workplace Health Promotion  Unit  within  the\r\n\r\nMinistry and we went out to various organisations and ministries\r\n\r\nto  help  them organise comprehensive workplace health promotion\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  We also train facilitators at the workplace so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  carry  on those programmes after  we  have  done  the\r\n\r\ninitial  kick-off for them.  Come September this year, in  order\r\n\r\nto  highlight the importance of our emphasis on workplace health\r\n\r\npromotion  programmes, we are going to present a special  award,\r\n\r\nthe  acronym  of  which  is HEALTH, which  stands  for  \"Helping\r\n\r\nEmployees Achieve Lifetime Health\", to those employers who  have\r\n\r\ncommendable workplace health promotion programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to show our appreciation here to NTUC for launching\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  Workplace Health Promotion Programme in  August  last\r\n\r\nyear  which had quite a widespread participation rate among  the\r\n\r\nvarious organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked what kind of incentives we should provide to\r\n\r\nemployers to promote health at the workplace.  But as he himself\r\n\r\nsaid,   increase  in  productivity,  decrease  in   absenteeism,\r\n\r\nincrease   in  worker's  morale,  all  these  will  reward   the\r\n\r\norganisation  many  times over the amount  that  they  spent  on\r\n\r\nhealth promotion activities.  So I think there is really no need\r\n\r\nfor additional incentives, such as tax incentives to be given to\r\n\r\nthese  organisations.  But I applaud and agree with him that  it\r\n\r\nis important to promote health at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee advocates compulsory deduction from Medisave\r\n\r\nof  family members if a patient is unable to pay for his medical\r\n\r\nexpenses, particularly if the family can afford to do so.   From\r\n\r\nour  experience,  there are actually very few  cases  where  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  family members refuse to pay for the healthcare  cost\r\n\r\nof  a patient, particularly the parent, who is unable to pay for\r\n\r\nhimself.   This  shows  that family links  or  relationships  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are still very strong, and in matters of  the  heart,\r\n\r\nlike  family relationships, filial piety, I think the Government\r\n\r\nshould not interfere as much as possible.  We already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  the  Maintenance of Parents Act which  allows  an  elderly\r\n\r\nperson  to claim maintenance from the children who are  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  but refuse to do so.  We should not  press  for  the\r\n\r\nmedical maintenance of parents further.  At least the problem is\r\n\r\nnot significant enough to warrant legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for dental care for the disabled, Mdm Claire Chiang\r\n\r\nraised the special case of the spastics.  Let me inform her that\r\n\r\nMOH  provides  dental service to the pupils of all  the  special\r\n\r\neducation  schools, including the spastics.  We do it either  by\r\n\r\nsending a mobile dental clinic to the school grounds, park there\r\n\r\nfor  a  couple  of months, and let the children have  a  regular\r\n\r\ncheck-up and be treated.  Or we give them access to the school's\r\n\r\ndental  clinics  at  nearby schools so that  the  volunteers  or\r\n\r\nteachers  can  bring the children over for their regular  dental\r\n\r\ncheck-ups  and  treatment.   The  children  from  these  special\r\n\r\nschools,  as  well as children from MOH approved welfare  homes,\r\n\r\nget  free treatment.  The other disabled children, if they visit\r\n\r\nour  polyclinics, our dental clinics, are charged  at  the  same\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate as children without disabilities,  that  is,\r\n\r\n50% of the adult rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think she recognises that children with certain types of\r\n\r\ndisabilities, such as spastic children, are difficult to  manage\r\n\r\nat  times, because there are uncontrollable movements  and  they\r\n\r\nare  not able to function as normal children in terms of  bodily\r\n\r\ncontrol.   It  is  a  complex problem.  For  children  who  need\r\n\r\nsedation  for  their dental treatment, they are presently  being\r\n\r\ncatered  to  by  the  National Dental  Centre.   Those  who  are\r\n\r\nspastic,  children  who  are  particularly  fidgety,  can   seek\r\n\r\ntreatment there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang spoke about the need for specially trained dentists\r\n\r\nwho  are  willing and able to handle the spastic children.   The\r\n\r\nstand of the Dental Faculty at NUH is that the Dental Centre  at\r\n\r\nNUH  provides  dental  care to disabled persons,  including  the\r\n\r\nspastic children or children with cerebral palsy.  In fact,  the\r\n\r\ndental students now are given exposure under the supervision  of\r\n\r\ntheir academic staff to treat these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchildren.  But it is not possible for every dental student to be\r\n\r\ntrained well enough to be able to handle these children on their\r\n\r\nown.   It  requires some further special training.  I think  the\r\n\r\nbest  solution  for  the spastic children  is  for  the  Spastic\r\n\r\nChildren  Association to run a dental clinic on its own,  which,\r\n\r\nin  fact, I hear they have plans to do so, when they move to the\r\n\r\nnew premises.  Then they can gather a group of dentists, whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  paid or volunteers, who would be helped by their  own\r\n\r\nparamedics  who would prepare the children for dental treatment.\r\n\r\nBy and by, they would accumulate some expertise in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another association, the Margaret Drive Special School\r\n\r\nwhich  will be running a dental clinic at its premises,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be manned completely by volunteers from the Dental  Health\r\n\r\nFoundation.  So, I think the Spastic Association can learn  from\r\n\r\nthe  experience of the Margaret Drive Special School on how they\r\n\r\ncan run this kind of dental clinic for spastic children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo made a very emotional appeal for the medical\r\n\r\nbenefits  of junior doctors.  I must say that I was taken  aback\r\n\r\nby  her  description  of  the Ministry of  Health  as  almost  a\r\n\r\nheartless  organisation.  I take strong objection to  that.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is concerned about the welfare and the morale  of  our\r\n\r\nstaff.   In  fact,  only recently, we have revised  the  medical\r\n\r\nscheme  of  service and implemented several measures to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  working conditions of medical doctors, including the junior\r\n\r\ndoctors, and these measures have been described in the House.  I\r\n\r\nwould not dwell on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked more specifically about the medical benefits\r\n\r\nfor  the  junior doctors.  Medical benefits have all along  been\r\n\r\nprovided  for  doctors in the civil service, which  include  our\r\n\r\njunior  doctors.  These were revised when changes were  made  to\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service medical benefit in 1994, in  line  with  our\r\n\r\nnational  objective  of encouraging personal responsibility  for\r\n\r\none's own healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Deputy Prime Minister introduced this scheme in\r\n\r\nthe House at the end of 1993, he gave a very full explanation of\r\n\r\nwhy  we  made  a  switch over from the old  scheme  to  the  new\r\n\r\nMedisave-cum-subsidised outpatient (MSO) scheme.  Under the 1994\r\n\r\nMSO  Scheme, the Government contributes an additional 1% of  the\r\n\r\nofficer's total monthly salary into his Medisave account.   This\r\n\r\nadditional   Medisave   contribution   is   meant    to    cover\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  expenses should they  be  incurred  or  to  buy\r\n\r\napproved  medical  insurance, including  MediShield,  MediShield\r\n\r\nPlus,  for costly serious illness.  So this additional  Medisave\r\n\r\nthat  is  paid  into  the salary of the doctors,  including  the\r\n\r\njunior  doctors  on MSO, is meant to cover his medical  expenses\r\n\r\nthrough   insurance  or  through  out-of-pocket  payments.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  the doctors or the civil servants in general  on  MSO\r\n\r\nare subsidised up to $350 a year for outpatient expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Health, all the new junior doctors are\r\n\r\nbriefed  on  their  eligibility for  medical  benefits  and  are\r\n\r\nadvised  to  purchase medical insurance coverage, using  the  1%\r\n\r\nadditional Medisave contribution.  However, I agree with Dr  Neo\r\n\r\nthat the hospitals where the doctors work should look after  the\r\n\r\njunior  doctors  well,  especially  those  who  require  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment   either  as  inpatient  or  outpatient,  and   extend\r\n\r\nappropriate  courtesy to them.  This has been emphasised  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to the hospitals from time to time.  Where the  junior\r\n\r\ndoctors  contract illnesses which arise out of  their  work  and\r\n\r\nrequire medical treatment, the Ministry is prepared to bear  the\r\n\r\ncost if it can be shown that the illness is related to the work.\r\n\r\nI  would therefore request Dr Neo to let me have the details  of\r\n\r\nthe two cases cited by her.  If my officers ascertain that their\r\n\r\nillnesses were work related, we will ask the hospitals concerned\r\n\r\nto look into bearing the cost of the medical treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the subject of hair transplant, hair loss is one of\r\n\r\nthose things in life associated with the aging process or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\notherwise,   which  I  think  we  all  have  to   take   a   bit\r\n\r\nphilosophically,  although this seems to afflict  one  sex  more\r\n\r\nthan the other.  For those who would like to seek treatment, the\r\n\r\nway is open to them.  Singapore does not ban hair transplant  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang's question to MOH is: what is our stand? Do we\r\n\r\nencourage  or  not encourage it?  We allow it to  be  practised.\r\n\r\nBut   because  of  the  technical  expertise  required  and  the\r\n\r\npotential  danger of infection, the procedure must be  performed\r\n\r\nby a registered medical practitioner with recognised specialties\r\n\r\nin   a   licensed  healthcare  establishment.   For  live   hair\r\n\r\ntransplant, it can only be performed by specialists certified in\r\n\r\nthe fields of plastic surgery, general surgery or dermatology. I\r\n\r\ndo  not have the time to describe to the House how this is done.\r\n\r\nBut  I  understand, in Singapore, there are currently 13 plastic\r\n\r\nsurgeons,  76  general  surgeons and 33 dermatologists  who  are\r\n\r\naccredited  under  the Specialist Accreditation  Board  who  can\r\n\r\nperform this procedure in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the case he mentioned, about why Mr Tham's clinic was not\r\n\r\nallowed to advertise hair transplant services, it is because  we\r\n\r\nhave established the specialist register and hair transplant  is\r\n\r\nnot  listed  or considered by a panel of experts as a specialty.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they were not allowed to advertise themselves  as  \"a\r\n\r\nlicensed medical clinic providing specialised services  in  hair\r\n\r\ntransplant\".  They can only use the term \"hair services\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, I must compliment the Minister for their\r\n\r\nconcise  and very refreshing response we got over the  last  two\r\n\r\nhours.

The NAC has recently unveiled\r\n\r\na  master  plan  for an intensive Arts Outreach Programme  which\r\n\r\naims at making the arts accessible to all Singaporeans.  It will\r\n\r\ntry  to  bring music, dance and theatre performances to HDB  new\r\n\r\ntowns, HDB town centres, MRT stations and shopping centres.   It\r\n\r\nis  indeed a good move.  Thanks also to Shell, the sponsor,  for\r\n\r\nthis  new  Arts Outreach Programme for this year, 1999,  without\r\n\r\nwhich the arts would not be able to reach our HDB heartland.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, Sir, the NAC has called for more private  sector\r\n\r\ncompanies to come forward to sponsor and to help bring the  arts\r\n\r\nto the doorstep of every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that our arts groups have been affected by the\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown.  The amount of sponsorship has not  been  as\r\n\r\nforthcoming  as before, as many companies have been affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  recession.  And unless the Government comes in to help fund\r\n\r\nthe arts groups during this economic slowdown to make up for the\r\n\r\nshortfall  in  sponsorship,  I  am  afraid  some  of  our   arts\r\n\r\nprogrammes may suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operating grant given to the NAC in this year's budget\r\n\r\nis  $16.3 million, and this amount shows a decrease of 7.2% over\r\n\r\nlast  year.   The decrease is attributed mainly to a  lower  EOM\r\n\r\nprovision because of a cut in employer's CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  savings in manpower costs here could have been given to our\r\n\r\narts  groups by way of greater grants to the NAC to enable  them\r\n\r\nto develop their talents and to carry out their activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nconvince the Ministry of Finance to provide more grants  through\r\n\r\nthe  NAC to assist these arts groups.  Unless this is done soon,\r\n\r\nsome of our arts groups may not survive this recession, and many\r\n\r\nmay not see daylight when the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NAC in the last 1-2 years has been promoting our arts\r\n\r\nabroad,  and this is also a wise move.  This includes  promoting\r\n\r\nSingapore's arts and artists at international markets to  secure\r\n\r\nperformance and exhibitions.  I wish to ask the Minister what is\r\n\r\nthe objective of regionalising our arts, and how successful have\r\n\r\nthey been so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I notice that in many\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments  and  private  companies,   art   works\r\n\r\nexhibited which are reproductions and not authentic works.  This\r\n\r\nmay  have  something to do with their budget on the purchase  of\r\n\r\nart  works.  Of course, in this present financial crisis, it may\r\n\r\nnot  be  a  practical suggestion to Government  departments  and\r\n\r\nprivate  companies to spend more money in buying  authentic  art\r\n\r\nworks  of  our  local artists.  We all know that art  works  are\r\n\r\npriceless.   The artistic value cannot be measured  in  monetary\r\n\r\nterms.   However, to many of the artists in Singapore,  most  of\r\n\r\nwhom  are  amateur artists, with  steady incomes of  their  own,\r\n\r\ntheir aspiration is that their art works can be exhibited in the\r\n\r\nreception   area  of  some  important  buildings   and   private\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Therefore, many of the local artists are willing  to\r\n\r\ndonate their works, free of charge to MITA.  Of course, they  do\r\n\r\nnot wish to see the art works they donated being tucked away  in\r\n\r\nthe storeroom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the privilege of visiting the Arts Museum of\r\n\r\nStanford University.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that the university had openly encouraged private\r\n\r\ncompanies to donate precious art works and antiques to them,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  received very enthusiastic response.  From what I know, the\r\n\r\nart  works  were permanently displayed in the arts  museum,  and\r\n\r\nwere  given  dedicated protection.  It is not  a  case  of  just\r\n\r\nexhibiting for a short while and then tucked away in the cellar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I hope that MITA could set up a Local Arts\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and  with the help of the NAC, to help  arrange  for\r\n\r\nthese  art  works  to  be  rotated and displayed  in  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  private  companies  for  open  exhibition  and\r\n\r\ndisplay.   In  this  way,  we can help to  encourage  our  local\r\n\r\nartists  to  continue with the arts creation,  and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  allow  Singaporeans and visitors to view  these  authentic\r\n\r\nworks of our local talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, arrangement should be made for masterpieces\r\n\r\npreviously donated by our older generation of artists and  local\r\n\r\ncollectors to be exhibited openly on a permanent basis, like the\r\n\r\narts  museum  at Stanford University.  This would  have  certain\r\n\r\nencouraging  effects  on private companies and  individuals  who\r\n\r\nwish to donate their art works in future.  It would also help to\r\n\r\nprevent  some  precious collections from  being  lost  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the promotion of arts\r\n\r\nneeds,  amongst  other  things, strong financial  support.   The\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown has affected many sectors.   Many  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations have reported significant drop in their donations,\r\n\r\nsome  as much as 40%.  I am sure our arts groups must have  been\r\n\r\nsimilarly  affected.   Corporate funding would  dry  up  if  the\r\n\r\neconomy does not improve.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask how badly has the National Arts Council's special\r\n\r\naccount  scheme  been affected?  While I can understand  private\r\n\r\nsector funding will be drastically\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduced,  I hope the Government will not slow down or  cut  back\r\n\r\npublic  sector funding for the arts.  In fact, if the Government\r\n\r\ncannot  increase  the funding to make up for  the  shortfall  in\r\n\r\ndonations  from  the private sector, the minimum the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  do  is  to  sustain the existing level of funding  for  NAC\r\n\r\ngrants.   I  urge  the  Government to  seriously  consider  more\r\n\r\nGovernment  funding  for the arts so as to help  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nrole and relevance of the arts in Singapore in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, efforts should be made to bring the arts to the\r\n\r\nmasses.  There should be more outreach programmes for the  young\r\n\r\nand old, as well as families and the working public to enjoy and\r\n\r\nhave  fun.  This can include more outdoor concerts in the parks,\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods  and shopping centres as well as arts  activities\r\n\r\norganised for residents at the constituencies.  MITA should work\r\n\r\nclosely with the Community Development Councils to promote  arts\r\n\r\non a shoestring budget and try to reach out to the HDB heartland\r\n\r\non  a  wider scale.  Community clubs could be encouraged to join\r\n\r\nwith  some arts groups and to excel in at least one of  the  art\r\n\r\nforms.  The community clubs management committees could be  made\r\n\r\npatrons to these arts groups, which can then be adopted  by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  clubs  who can also help to support the  arts  groups\r\n\r\nfinancially, besides providing a convenient venue to  house  the\r\n\r\narts groups.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Chinese\r\n\r\noperas   in  Singapore  are  mainly  dialect-based  in  Teochew,\r\n\r\nCantonese, Hokkien and Hainanese.  The general impression  given\r\n\r\nis  that  the majority of people in the audience are the  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens and these operas are performed mainly  during  the  7th\r\n\r\nMoon  Festival.  However, the fact is, over the past  20  to  30\r\n\r\nyears,  Chinese opera in Singapore has evolved from  an  outdoor\r\n\r\nwayang-type  of  performances  to indoor  theatres  and   school\r\n\r\nauditoriums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to records kept by the Singapore Chinese Opera\r\n\r\nInstitute, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  a  total of some 2,500 performances of Chinese  operas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1998.  Out of these, some 1,500 performances  took\r\n\r\nplace   during   the  7th  Moon  Festival.   The   other   1,000\r\n\r\nperformances  were  in  the  schools,  community   centres   and\r\n\r\ntheatres.  A good number of these performances took place at the\r\n\r\nVictoria Theatre,  next door to our Parliament House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the senior citizens and middle-aged people, more and\r\n\r\nmore  young  people  are  attending such performances  nowadays.\r\n\r\nSome even take part in the performances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent rise in support level for Chinese operas in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  be   attributed  to  two  reasons.  First,   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Singapore Chinese Opera Institute  in  1995\r\n\r\nto  promote  Chinese  opera  in the schools  and  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.   Secondly, we have a group of enthusiasts  who,  while\r\n\r\nkeeping  a low profile, have been contributing money,  time  and\r\n\r\nefforts  to  support these theatre groups in their performances,\r\n\r\nnot   only  locally,  but  overseas  as  well.    The  Singapore\r\n\r\nFederation of Clan Associations and other community groups  have\r\n\r\nbeen  inviting  well-known artistes from  China  to  perform  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a lot of problems exist in the Chinese opera\r\n\r\ntheatres,  the people are continuing to help out  in  their  own\r\n\r\nway.   I  believe that many of our Members here  have  seen  the\r\n\r\nstreet  wayangs in the past.  I myself have enjoyed tremendously\r\n\r\nwatching  street wayangs and have learnt a lot of  lessons  from\r\n\r\nthere.   These  Chinese  operas  have  not  only  enriched   our\r\n\r\nfestivals  but  also our childhood.  It is also a  good  way  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  in our people the traditional Chinese values.   There\r\n\r\nare   a  lot  of  stories  that  teach  loyalty,  filial  piety,\r\n\r\nbenevolence and justice, and to show us how we could  deal  with\r\n\r\nproblems  in  times of crisis.  This is the type of  spirit   we\r\n\r\nneed, especially in the present crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should accord due recognition to these\r\n\r\nenthusiasts  who have contributed greatly to the development  of\r\n\r\ntraditional Chinese operas in Singapore so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  to  encourage  more people to come forward  and  lend  their\r\n\r\nsupport in this field.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In recent\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Government's main economic policy is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to come forward and venture into business,  become\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  create more wealth for  our  people  and  our\r\n\r\nnation.   Like many people I know, I am quite intrigued by  this\r\n\r\ncall by the Government.  Singapore is a market economy.  Do  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  need to be encouraged before they  come  out  and\r\n\r\nmake  big  money?   Have our people not enjoyed excellent  track\r\n\r\nrecords in their business ventures all this while?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please allow me to take this House on a tour outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.   First,  we go to the famous Silicon  Valley.   Many\r\n\r\npeople  call  this  the \"IC Valley\".  IC, of course,  refers  to\r\n\r\nIntegrated  Circuit.  But many people say it  could  jolly  well\r\n\r\nstand  for  Indians  and Chinese.  Why?   Because  many  of  the\r\n\r\nscientists and businessmen who study, work and start enterprises\r\n\r\nthere are of Chinese and Indian origins.  In Silicon Valley, 23%\r\n\r\nof  the  people were born outside the United States of  America.\r\n\r\nThe  culture they were exposed to during their early  years  was\r\n\r\nnot  American   culture,  but the various  cultures  from  their\r\n\r\nnative  countries.   When they were young,  the  education  they\r\n\r\nreceived  could well be very traditional, and not what  we  call\r\n\r\n\"creative\" nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we go to Vancouver, Canada. You will notice that 5%\r\n\r\nto  10%  of  the businesses there are being run by the  Chinese.\r\n\r\nLike  the  Silicon Valley, most of the Chinese there  came  from\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and Taiwan. They publish their own newspapers,  have\r\n\r\ntheir own shopping centres, television station, etc.  In a short\r\n\r\nspan of 10 to 20 years, they actually emerged from a society  of\r\n\r\nwhite people, and opened up a whole new world of their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to Asia. There is no lack of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nIn  the  area  of  high-tech industry,  Taiwan  is  particularly\r\n\r\noutstanding, having\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperformed  remarkably well.  In a short period of  20-odd  years\r\n\r\nafter  the cultural revolution, a good number of new enterprises\r\n\r\nhave  sprouted  in  mainland  China.   Their  entrepreneurs  are\r\n\r\nenthusiastic,  far-sighted, daring to venture, and  hardworking.\r\n\r\nWhen  our businessmen went to China to have dealings with  them,\r\n\r\nwe often have the feeling that we are inferior to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a population of 4 million. Hong Kong's population\r\n\r\nis  twice  that  of ours, while Taiwan is five times.   However,\r\n\r\namong the successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, the number\r\n\r\nof  those  who originated from Hong Kong and Taiwan is far,  far\r\n\r\nmore than ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not talk about Chinese for the time being. In America's\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley  or  business  sector,  there  are  a   lot   of\r\n\r\noutstanding Indian scientists and management experts.   Most  of\r\n\r\nthem are first or second-generation immigrants from India.  With\r\n\r\nsharp  foresight and high education, they are able to seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunities, catch on with the fast moving economic trend, and\r\n\r\neventually outshine others in various fields.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many philosophers and social scientists hold the view that\r\n\r\nChina's  Confucian  teachings  and  India's  Hinduism  are   not\r\n\r\npositive  enough.   They resist science and technology,   regard\r\n\r\nthemselves  as infallible, and thus resulted in their  societies\r\n\r\nnot progressing with the times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a sociologist, and I have no wish to challenge this\r\n\r\nargument here.  However, the examples I cited above have already\r\n\r\nproven  that  there are errors in their macroscopic  conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhat they have seen are the results of historical evolution over\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  of  years in China and  India.   But  they  have\r\n\r\nneglected  the  fact that these were the effects caused  by  the\r\n\r\nmonarchy  and government officials. Whether it was the  monarchy\r\n\r\nwho used the Confucian ideology to rule the nation or it was the\r\n\r\nConfucian ideology that brought about the monarchy is  an  issue\r\n\r\nwhich has been debated over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand over since time immemorial without any conclusive outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking at it from various angles, this ancient\r\n\r\ncultural  ideology  does  have its  merits.   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nConfucian  teachings advocate honouring the old  and  respecting\r\n\r\nthe  wise;  always  ready  to  help  in  a  worthy  cause;  good\r\n\r\nneighbourliness  and  friendliness, spirit  of  magnanimity  and\r\n\r\nresoluteness, honesty and faithfulness, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, Chinese immigrants to the various parts of\r\n\r\nthe  world  were  mostly  illiterate, but  they  all  came  from\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  Confucian  background.   From  young,  they   were\r\n\r\nimperceptibly  influenced  by the traditional  consciousness  of\r\n\r\nConfucianism which was deeply embedded in their youthful  minds.\r\n\r\nSo  when  they  went  overseas to  earn  a  living,  they  would\r\n\r\nspontaneously follow the moral standards and ethics set down  by\r\n\r\nthe  Confucian teachings, and stick to them judiciously for  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  their  lives.   This situation  includes  the  Straits\r\n\r\nChinese  or  Baba  which have settled down overseas  since  many\r\n\r\ngenerations ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Confucianism has so much negative effects, then how do\r\n\r\nyou  explain  the  success stories of the Hong Kong  and  Taiwan\r\n\r\npeople in the United States.  The amount of Confucianism in them\r\n\r\nis certainly more than that in us.  It cannot be less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our most successful entrepreneurs in the high-tech field,\r\n\r\nMr  Sim  Wong Hoo, for example.  Those days, with the  Confucian\r\n\r\nteachings  in  him, he started off with $200 a  month,  suffered\r\n\r\nhardship  and  persevered  in toil, knowledge-oriented,  learned\r\n\r\nfrom  his mistakes, and brought up his Creative Technology  from\r\n\r\nnothing to today's glamorous high-tech empire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from Mr Sim, Singapore has no other more outstanding\r\n\r\nexample.   Personally,  I  feel that apart  from  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and  the size of our domestic market, other factors  are\r\n\r\ngradually  causing  Singapore to be  lacking  in  entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the  factors  is the diluting  of  our  culture.   Many\r\n\r\nyoungsters\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntoday  can  be  said to be half-eastern and half-western.   They\r\n\r\nhave  not learnt the excellent oriental culture, nor the essence\r\n\r\nof the Western culture.  On the one hand, they do not have their\r\n\r\nancestors'  virtues of being plain and simple,  hardworking  and\r\n\r\nthrifty,  honouring  the old and respecting  the  wise,  keeping\r\n\r\none's word and having good faith.  On the other hand,  they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  emulate the creative and independent spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nwesterners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope that the Minister would seriously consider\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  If necessary, engage the services of experts  to\r\n\r\nstudy  and  find out the respective merits and strong points  of\r\n\r\nthe  oriental and western cultures to educate the people through\r\n\r\nour institutions of learning, community organisations and social\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Minister would study our kiasu culture,\r\n\r\nand transform it into  a \"win-win\" culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, there has been some talk or opinion\r\n\r\nthat the next millennium in the 21st century will start only  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  2001, and not the year 2000.  May I ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the official view on this, and what is the  basis  for\r\n\r\nthis view?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that MITA is coordinating the millennium\r\n\r\ncelebration  this year to try to bring Singaporeans together  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate this occasion to usher in the new millennium.   May  I\r\n\r\nask  the Minister to unveil the celebration plan to this  House,\r\n\r\nand also let the House know what amount of money is estimated to\r\n\r\nbe  spent on these celebrations?  What proportion will come from\r\n\r\nthe Government coffer?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next subject matter on heritage projects, I do not\r\n\r\npropose  to  speak,  as  I understand Mr Hawazi  Daipi  will  be\r\n\r\nspeaking on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, six budget sittings ago, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Information and the Arts announced in  this  House\r\n\r\nthe  formation of a working group to look into the establishment\r\n\r\nof a Malay Heritage Centre.  I believe MITA has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexamined the working group's recommendations, and would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether the Government has made a decision  on\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think there is a need to set up a Malay Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre  which  can be a centre of reference for  Malay  culture.\r\n\r\nThe  Malay community in Singapore originates from many different\r\n\r\nparts of the region.  In the past, living in their own enclaves,\r\n\r\nthey showed distinct characteristics.  However, in the past  two\r\n\r\ndecades or so, with inter-marriages and lesser use of their  own\r\n\r\ndialects or rather languages, the young Singaporeans from  these\r\n\r\nMalay  sub-ethnic  background may not  be  aware  of  their  own\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage.   The Malay Heritage  Centre,  if  and  when\r\n\r\nestablished, could therefore be a reference centre for those who\r\n\r\nwant  to learn about and contribute to the understanding of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  general and the Malay sub-ethnic  groups   -   their\r\n\r\nhistory  of migration, languages and dialects as well  as  their\r\n\r\nbusiness and trade links.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minster a few basic questions. If MITA\r\n\r\nsupports  the  establishment of a Malay Heritage  Centre,  where\r\n\r\nwill  it  be located, who will run it, and what kind of  support\r\n\r\nwill the Government give to the Centre?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, first of all, I must thank MITA and the\r\n\r\nNational  Heritage  Board  for the fine  work  it  has  done  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our museums are today better housed.  There are more\r\n\r\nexhibits.  It is not only the local people who are visiting them\r\n\r\nbut also the foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to touch on today is another issue. This is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  locate  our buildings of historical  interest,  both\r\n\r\ncommercial as well as residential buildings, where our  pioneers\r\n\r\nhad lived and many of our shophouses which used to house schools\r\n\r\nin  Amoy Street and Tanjong Pagar.  I would urge MITA to explore\r\n\r\nthis.  Whether  it is school or clan association,  it  may  have\r\n\r\nstarted  off as a small shophouse and today a high-rise building\r\n\r\nmay be there.  What I want the Minister to consider is a plaque,\r\n\r\nwhich in fact they have already started doing.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant for our children to know our history and this  process\r\n\r\ncould  be  easily attained if we follow some of the  suggestions\r\n\r\nwhich I have told the House.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect which I would like the Minister to consider is\r\n\r\nthis.   Some  years back, the National Museum joined force  with\r\n\r\nthe Hindu Endowments Board to have the Deepavali celebrations on\r\n\r\na  Sunday with food and paintings, etc.  Because it was not well\r\n\r\npublicised  very few tourists came.  But the tourists  who  came\r\n\r\nwere  really impressed.  I think it would be something  for  not\r\n\r\nonly  our  own students to see, but also the visitors  at  large\r\n\r\ncould  see  for themselves what Singapore has to offer.   May  I\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister  to consider this, even if  it  may  require\r\n\r\nfinancial expenditure, but I think it is worthy of support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, not\r\n\r\nlong  ago, the well-known Chinese calligrapher and poet, Mr  Pan\r\n\r\nShou,  passed away.  This is a great loss to the arts  community\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   His death has left an irreparable  gap  in  the\r\n\r\nfield  of  calligraphy  in  Singapore.   We  have  also  lost  a\r\n\r\n\"National  Treasure\"  in  the arts. The  works  of  a  \"National\r\n\r\nTreasure\" like Pan Shou should be treasured by the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan Shou cannot be resurrected or born again. Whatever he has\r\n\r\nleft behind, his calligraphy and poems should be treasured by us\r\n\r\nvery  dearly.   Many  of us, especially the  lovers  of  Chinese\r\n\r\ncalligraphy,  have  expressed the hope that  the  representative\r\n\r\nworks of Pan Shou should be systematically kept and preserved by\r\n\r\nthe State as our arts assets for posterity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am thinking not only of Pan Shou but also other\r\n\r\n\"National   Treasure\"   class  artists  in   Singapore.    Their\r\n\r\nrepresentative works should be collected and carefully kept in a\r\n\r\nsystematic  manner.  May I suggest that our National  Museum  or\r\n\r\nArts Museum set up a special exhibition\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nroom  or  hall  for the display of the representative  works  of\r\n\r\nthese  \"National Treasures\".  Since they are national treasures,\r\n\r\ntheir works of art should be regarded as part and parcel of  our\r\n\r\narts  assets  of  the  State.  By having this  sort  of  special\r\n\r\ndisplay  or  exhibition hall, we can avoid having  our  artists'\r\n\r\ntreasured  works being lost to other countries.   It would  also\r\n\r\nprovide  the opportunity for young Singaporeans and tourists  to\r\n\r\nview  the  representative works of our masters in arts.   By  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  it  will  also  gradually  and  eventually  enrich   the\r\n\r\ncollection of our museum.  If we have such a plan in place, I am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  will get the support from our local  collectors  to\r\n\r\ndonate their collections to the museum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on this National Red\r\n\r\nLion  head that we have.  This Red Lion icon that we have  is  a\r\n\r\nNational  Day symbol and I wish to ask for it to be  made  as  a\r\n\r\nnational symbol protected by the law, just as the State crest or\r\n\r\nthe State flag and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons for this is that the icon has become a\r\n\r\nvery familiar sight among the public in Singapore and it has  in\r\n\r\nfact  become associated in a large part with what we do whenever\r\n\r\nwe  have  a national event.  It is in fact even more well  known\r\n\r\nthan the Merlion icon, which in the early days had been used  to\r\n\r\nrepresent Singapore.  It was, as I said yesterday in this House,\r\n\r\na  very recent invention and, in fact, very much related to  the\r\n\r\ntourism  industry, so that now it is more an icon  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ntourism than an icon of nation itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a lion city and the Red Lion head has done well. It\r\n\r\nhas  done  so well, in fact, that CASE actually went  after  one\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  renovation  contractor.   We  found   that   their\r\n\r\nletterhead had the Red Lion icon and a logo that looks  somewhat\r\n\r\nlike  the HDB logo.  And they were telling people in that estate\r\n\r\nand  several  estates in Singapore that they were implying  that\r\n\r\nthey  were HDB renovation contractors engaged by HDB  to  do  an\r\n\r\nupgrading programme, and they said, \"Please sign up by today, or\r\n\r\nelse  you  are  forever  out  of the upgrading  programme.\"   We\r\n\r\nrealise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat a lot of people were taken in because when they saw the Red\r\n\r\nLion  icon  and thought it was really a Government agency,  they\r\n\r\ntherefore had to respond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is one of the reasons why I think a national icon\r\n\r\nlike  this should be protected.  And I think it has done a  very\r\n\r\ngood  job  in  identifying  Singapore and  Singapore's  national\r\n\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, following calls by Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House  in  the  past  to  develop  the  film  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Government last year set up the Singapore  Film\r\n\r\nCommission.   I understand the Commission's task is to  nurture,\r\n\r\nsupport  and  promote  Singapore  talent  in  film-making,   the\r\n\r\nproduction of Singapore movies and films and the development  of\r\n\r\nour  film  industry  in Singapore.  With the recent  success  of\r\n\r\nlocally  produced movies like Liang Po Po, Money No  Enough  and\r\n\r\nForever  Fever,  the  demand  for  local  movies  has  increased\r\n\r\nmarkedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should now accelerate and step up the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our local movie and film industry.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nwish   to  ask  the  Minister  what  plans  the  Singapore  Film\r\n\r\nCommission has to meet its challenges ahead and how soon can our\r\n\r\nlocal  movies reach a standard comparable to the better ones  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong, Taiwan and even the PRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, before I speak on the issue, I\r\n\r\nshare  the sentiments of Dr Toh See Kiat on the Red Lion  and  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister would give consideration.  After all,  we\r\n\r\nare a Lion City, Singa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to films. The Singapore Film Commission has\r\n\r\ncome into existence.  It is good.  It is just not enough for  us\r\n\r\nto  nurture the film industry here.  Recently I was in Australia\r\n\r\nand  I  was surprised how the Australians were trying to set  up\r\n\r\ntheir  own  film industry and the Americans were  interested  in\r\n\r\nsetting  up a studio there.  In fact, Indian film producers  are\r\n\r\nsending  their crew to Australia.  Then I found to  my  surprise\r\n\r\nthat  they had also been to Singapore.  And for Hindi and  Tamil\r\n\r\nfilms, they sometimes come here for shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with the House an anecdote which somebody told me.\r\n\r\nThey  saw a Hindi picture with a Singapore scene, and they  were\r\n\r\nso  attracted that they sent a crew to visit some of the  spots.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a good selling point for us.  But what would\r\n\r\nbe more interesting is if we could develop the facilities as one-shop facilities where we offer tax incentives and what-nots.   I\r\n\r\nthink  Singapore, being located strategically,  has  advantages.\r\n\r\nBecause even Mauritius, which is far away, the Indian film  crew\r\n\r\nare going in.  Bear in mind that the Indian film industry is one\r\n\r\nof  the biggest in the world.  I think we should look at it  not\r\n\r\njust artistically but also its commercial viability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, two weeks back, somebody told me that there was a\r\n\r\nshooting done here by an Indian film company.  But I think  more\r\n\r\nmust  be  done.  Probably our High Commission and other agencies\r\n\r\nthere could work it out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past one year,\r\n\r\nour    newspapers,  television  and  radio,  and   even   senior\r\n\r\nGovernment officers, have openly supported the development of  a\r\n\r\nfilm industry in Singapore.  As a matter of fact, the local film\r\n\r\nindustry has enjoyed great results during the past one year.  It\r\n\r\nis  true  that we do have excellent local talents  in  the  film\r\n\r\nindustry  but,  more importantly, there is enthusiastic  support\r\n\r\nfrom  various  quarters.  Singaporeans find a  strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nidentity  with  the  local films.  I  think  this  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  contributing to the  recent  locally-produced\r\n\r\nfilms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that TCS has done a lot to help the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our local film industry.  When I went  to  watch\r\n\r\nJack  Neo's  Money  No Enough and Liang Po Po  -  The  Movie,  I\r\n\r\nnoticed that some famous artistes from TCS, like Zoe Tay and Kym\r\n\r\nNg,  had  made guest appearances in the films.  This illustrates\r\n\r\nTCS'  sense  of  identity  with our local  productions  and  its\r\n\r\nsupport  for the local film industry.  It is heartening to  note\r\n\r\nthat  TCS  has acted pro-actively to promote the development  of\r\n\r\nthe film industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, many people would have thought that it was\r\n\r\nimpossible. In the past, TCS was only concerned with  protecting\r\n\r\nitself and would try its best to avoid its competitors.  But now\r\n\r\nTCS has changed for the better.  I notice that TCS has used some\r\n\r\nphotographs taken from Liang Po Po - The Movie  on the cover  of\r\n\r\nits   Radio  and  TV  weekly,  and  was  giving  away  some  250\r\n\r\ncomplimentary tickets to its readers.  Inside the magazine there\r\n\r\nwere  11  pages of coloured photographs to introduce this  film.\r\n\r\nThis shows that TCS has given great publicity and support to the\r\n\r\nlocal  films,  and by doing so it will help the local  films  to\r\n\r\ngrow steadily and rapidly in Singapore.  Without the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers,  TV and the people, I do not think  they  would\r\n\r\nhave achieved such a marvellous box office record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend MITA and TCS for being so open-minded in\r\n\r\nhelping  the development of our local film industry.   With  its\r\n\r\nown  financial resources, skills and technology,  TCS  is   well\r\n\r\ncapable  of  producing its own local movies  and  even  gung  fu\r\n\r\nfilms.    I   believe  there  is  a  steady  market  for   these\r\n\r\nproductions.   Of  course, when TCS wants  to  produce  its  own\r\n\r\nmovies,  it  should select some themes or subject matters  which\r\n\r\nare  different from those of other local films.  Then there will\r\n\r\nbe  some very healthy competition.  By doing so, it will open up\r\n\r\na new phase of development of the film industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the number of locally produced movies is still very\r\n\r\nlimited.   If TCS can participate in this field and can  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  demands  of our local audiences, it will go a long  way  to\r\n\r\npromote  the  growth of our local film industry.  I  hope  that,\r\n\r\nvery soon, films produced by TCS can have an important place  in\r\n\r\nthe  international film arena, and perhaps win an Oscar one day.\r\n\r\nI hope that MITA will encourage TCS to take on this challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng Han Thong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the face of Singapore TV has changed\r\n\r\ntremendously  over  the  years.   In  the  early  days,  our  TV\r\n\r\nproducers   in   the   then   SBC,  or  Singapore   Broadcasting\r\n\r\nCorporation, concentrated on producing local documentaries, news\r\n\r\nand  current affairs programmes.  Entertainment programmes  were\r\n\r\nlargely  imported.   Today,  our local  TV  stations  have  been\r\n\r\ncorporatised.  Thus, they are largely accountable for their  own\r\n\r\nresources and the need to remain commercially viable.  I do  not\r\n\r\nenvy the management of these local TV stations.  Their jobs  are\r\n\r\nonerous.  This is made worse by the increased competition  posed\r\n\r\nby  some  30  channels  from Singapore Cable  Vision.   And  the\r\n\r\neasiest  way  out  for  our  local TV  stations  is  to  acquire\r\n\r\nprogrammes from abroad and to repeat these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not to say that our local TV stations have not been\r\n\r\nproducing  local  programmes.  Indeed, they  have  been.   Since\r\n\r\ncorporatisation, local productions from TCS have grown markedly.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a commercial organisation and with its focus on  the\r\n\r\nbottomline,  TCS may sacrifice quality for quantity.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nwith  intense competition to be posed by SCV, when the cable  TV\r\n\r\nproject linking up the whole island is completed by end of  this\r\n\r\nyear, our local TV station may be forced to change strategies to\r\n\r\nremain viable and forget about its nation building role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a national objective, our local TVs have to carry or\r\n\r\nproduce  local  programmes to promote our culture,  arts,  value\r\n\r\nsystem, current affairs, local politics, info-education and even\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to reflect our multi-racial society.  They  have  to\r\n\r\nmanage  the requirements and sensitivities across the age groups\r\n\r\ncatering for children's television as well as the needs  of  our\r\n\r\nretirees.   I  wish  to ask the Minister how are  our  local  TV\r\n\r\nstations  coping  with  the challenges ahead  and  if  he  would\r\n\r\nreassure  this  House  that there will  be  more  quality  local\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on our local TV stations, ie, Channel 5, Channel  8,\r\n\r\nPrime 12, Premiere 12 and now Channel News Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if\r\n\r\nour  local  media could stay relevant in the light of  increased\r\n\r\nproliferations of foreign media in Singapore and easy access  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It is undoubted that, for Singapore to succeed as\r\n\r\na  knowledge-based economy, access to information  is  critical.\r\n\r\nThe  impact  of foreign media reporting on current  affairs  and\r\n\r\nnews  on  our  underlying societal values and political  systems\r\n\r\ncould be anathema to the values that we uphold.  This is because\r\n\r\nthe  foreign media, unlike our local media or TV stations,  have\r\n\r\nno  obligations  to  support or reflect the national  objectives\r\n\r\nhighlighted earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the playing field is therefore not level. My concern\r\n\r\nspecifically is whilst our local news network presently  upholds\r\n\r\nthe  principle of giving election air-time to political  parties\r\n\r\nin  proportion  to  the  strength of  their  participation,  the\r\n\r\nforeign media has no such constraint.  Indeed, we have witnessed\r\n\r\nmany interviews from CNBC and BBC with some populist politicians\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  of late for frivolous causes.  This principle  of\r\n\r\nfair  election air-time will no doubt come under pressure  since\r\n\r\nforeign  networks  with different sympathies  could  simply  air\r\n\r\ninterviews  and  programmes which our local citizens  have  free\r\n\r\naccess to.  In order to compete, our local network, media and TV\r\n\r\nstations  may  be  under  pressure  to  abandon  this  long-held\r\n\r\nprinciple of fairness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to avoid the situation in Malaysia where\r\n\r\nthe  circulation  of Utusan Malaysia actually fell  dramatically\r\n\r\nduring  the  early days when Mr Anwar was arrested, as  distrust\r\n\r\nfor local media in Malaysia had led to a lot of Malaysians going\r\n\r\nto  the  Internet and foreign media.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister if he has any comments or plans to ensure that national\r\n\r\nobjectives and long held values by Singaporeans can continue  to\r\n\r\nbe reflected in our broadcasters' selection of programmes in the\r\n\r\nface of uneven competition posed by the foreign media.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I must, at the outset, declare my\r\n\r\ninterest.  I am a member of the Indian Programmes Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will confine my remarks to the Indian programmes,\r\n\r\nnamely, Tamil.  It would be dishonest not to say that the Indian\r\n\r\nprogrammes  have improved considerably.  But there is  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement, especially in view of the competition that is faced\r\n\r\nby  cable television from both SUN and ZEE.  I know some  people\r\n\r\nare saying that this should be closed.  I would ask the Minister\r\n\r\nnot  to  do  so because there is no other Hindi programme  other\r\n\r\nthan  film.  We should continue.  In fact, we should have  more,\r\n\r\nso that people have more choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one danger. Many older viewers tend to\r\n\r\nidentify with politics in India and they watch Indian programmes\r\n\r\nbecause  our Tamil programmes are very limited.  So many viewers\r\n\r\nhave  the opportunity of tuning to these channels.  May  I  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider, first of all, increasing the air-time\r\n\r\nof  the  Tamil programmes and also to have more current  affairs\r\n\r\nprogramme.   It is very important for the Indians in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Indians  I  would say, to have a  programme  that  is\r\n\r\ntailored  to their needs and not depend too much on  the  Indian\r\n\r\nprogrammes because their values are quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to build a multi-racial society and it is very\r\n\r\nimportant  that the Tamil programmes should cover not  just  the\r\n\r\nIndian programmes but the Chinese and Malay programmes as  well.\r\n\r\nIt  is very important for the Indian community to get a feel  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  communities as well if we have to build  a  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.   I  feel strongly on this  issue  and  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  give some thought to it.  I know that  finance  is\r\n\r\nlimited and the figure he is going to cite is, \"We have only  7%\r\n\r\nand  so we cannot give you more.\"  But I think we must not think\r\n\r\njust   in  terms  of  digits,  but  in  terms  of  the  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  I hope the Minister will consider my proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, TCS launched a new free air channel on\r\n\r\n1st March to provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnews when you want and where you want it.  With this new channel\r\n\r\nproviding different market views from TCS, CNN and others, there\r\n\r\nis a potential to develop a regional audience for regional news.\r\n\r\nReliable   information   for  informed  business   decision   is\r\n\r\nimportant.  During this economic crisis, there is an urgent need\r\n\r\nfor  more  accurate  news and different news  perspective.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the western media reports on China are always  on  the\r\n\r\nviewpoint  of  human rights and unrest in Tibet.   But  news  in\r\n\r\nChina  is  more  than  just  Tibet.  Businessmen  will  be  more\r\n\r\ninterested  in  matters  such  as possible  devaluation  of  the\r\n\r\nRenminbi,   economic  changes  in  China   or   new   investment\r\n\r\nregulations from Beijing.  Channel News Asia is therefore a much\r\n\r\nwelcome  change.  This channel also has the potential to develop\r\n\r\ninto  a  much sought after channel by the international business\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Currently, a number of areas still have difficulties\r\n\r\nin receiving Channel News Asia.  Right within my own division of\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  East, 22 blocks of HDB apartments are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nreceive  this channel.  It is not just HDB estates  but  private\r\n\r\nestates  are  also affected.  What measures would  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nrectify this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the glut of satellite transponders that are now\r\n\r\nreadily  available, TCS should consider expanding  Channel  News\r\n\r\nAsia to satellite transmission and really establish Singapore as\r\n\r\na  regional  news  broadcasting  centre.   It  will  also  allow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans based overseas to keep in touch with reliable  news\r\n\r\nreports  of events happening back home.  Can I ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor his views on the future development of Channel News Asia and\r\n\r\nwhether establishing Channel News Asia requires more grants from\r\n\r\nthe Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to provide certain product\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  between  regional news  and  local  news.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  then  is the quality of newscaster that is  available.\r\n\r\nIs there a sufficient number and, if not, what measures will the\r\n\r\nGovernment take to improve this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, Channel News Asia is broadcast only in\r\n\r\nEnglish.

I wish to assure him that there\r\n\r\nis  no  need for him to worry about such influence because  this\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the PAP Government, will know how to  control  such\r\n\r\ninfluence directly or indirectly and to ensure that at least  it\r\n\r\nis not easy for Mr Chew, because of the influence, that he might\r\n\r\nlose his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are various ways that the Government could\r\n\r\ninfluence the stations although they might be plugged  into  the\r\n\r\ncable  network.   There  is  the granting  of  licence  and  the\r\n\r\nquestion of whether or not they will be accessible to the  cable\r\n\r\nnetwork.   Similarly, the same goes to foreign  publications  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Government deals with foreign publications  by\r\n\r\ninfluencing them on how to report or what to report.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthey  may  be  banned  or their circulation will  be  curtailed.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  I  do not think that there is a cause for  Mr  Chew  to\r\n\r\nworry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that, although Singapore Cable Vision is\r\n\r\na  private  firm, some of the major shareholders are Government-linked  companies  and  I also understand  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nintends  to use the cable system for the Singapore ONE  national\r\n\r\nIT  project.  With this backdrop in mind, I wonder whether it is\r\n\r\nthe  Government's intention to force all Singaporeans to use the\r\n\r\ncable network.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a concern among those who do not intend to connect\r\n\r\nto  the  cable network that the television stations may one  day\r\n\r\ndecide  not  to transmit signals via the air wave.  Thereby  the\r\n\r\ntraditional mode of receiving TV programmes via the antenna\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem  will  become obsolete and indirectly force  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who wishes to watch television to connect to the cable\r\n\r\nnetwork.   I  would therefore like the Government to  state  its\r\n\r\nposition on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that those who live in landed property will\r\n\r\nhave  to pay a yearly maintenance fee to Singapore Cable  Vision\r\n\r\nunder the connection agreement. If one wishes to continue to use\r\n\r\nthe cable network to receive those non-paying channels, like the\r\n\r\nHDB  flat dwellers, after they have paid for the laying  of  the\r\n\r\ncable infrastructure, I would like to know what is the rationale\r\n\r\nfor imposing such a fee which is subject to revision by SCV.   I\r\n\r\nwould  also like to know whether the Minister thinks it is  fair\r\n\r\nfor  SCV  to  impose  such  a  fee  for  maintaining  the  cable\r\n\r\ninfrastructure after asking the residents to pay for the  laying\r\n\r\nof  the  cable infrastructure in the first place.

SCV's  $500\r\n\r\nmillion nation-wide cable network is expected to be completed by\r\n\r\nSeptember this year, three months ahead of schedule.  All  these\r\n\r\nare commendable achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek clarification with regard to four aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst,  this  is  the first time in Singapore's history  that  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide  infrastructure  has been  installed  by  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany and not by a Government agency.  I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to elaborate on why this is the case.  What aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe   company,  that  is,  the  Government  and  presumably  SBA\r\n\r\nregulate,  and  how much subsidy is involved in  developing  the\r\n\r\ncable network, if at all?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what I find uncomfortable is that SCV is the monopoly\r\n\r\nprovider  of access to TV channels, such as CNN, CNBC, Discovery\r\n\r\nChannel, and so on.  Singaporeans do not have a choice  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter because satellite dishes are not allowed in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no alternative but to subscribe to SCV if I want to  watch\r\n\r\nCNN  or  Discovery Channel.  The question I have is:  would  the\r\n\r\nprice  be  reduced and service improved if indeed there  was  an\r\n\r\nalternative  provider to cable television than  just  SCV?   For\r\n\r\nexample,  could  not SingTel ADSL network provide  the  same  TV\r\n\r\nquality services so that consumers have a choice whether\r\n\r\nthey wish to subscribe to Magix or to SCV?\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is also the issue of the hook-up fee. I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the hook-up fee is based on the cost for service\r\n\r\nprinciples.  Since it costs more to roll out the cable to landed\r\n\r\nhomes,  landed  homes pay more.  I subscribe to this  principle.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  find  difficult in understanding is, however,  how  the\r\n\r\nrates  are arrived at and why there is such a large differential\r\n\r\nbetween HDB flats on the one hand which pay nothing for the hook-up,  and landed properties which pay up to about $6,000 for  the\r\n\r\nhook-up  fee?  My question here is: is there also the  principle\r\n\r\nof  the  ability  to  pay used in terms of charging?   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  in  terms of charging $6,000 for landed  properties,  is\r\n\r\nthere a sense that because landed property owners can afford it,\r\n\r\nso therefore they should pay more?  Or is it merely based on the\r\n\r\nissue of cost for service?  Does it cost that much more to  roll\r\n\r\nout  a  cable to a landed property home compared to a HDB  flat,\r\n\r\nprivate condominiums and so on?  I would like to ask whether  it\r\n\r\nis  true indeed that there was a Government grant to SCV to wire\r\n\r\nabout  7,000  HDB blocks but no grant for private  flats  and  I\r\n\r\npresume no grants for landed properties.  This was a point which\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned during last year's debate.  And if this is indeed\r\n\r\ntrue, what is the size of the grant and why is it this grant was\r\n\r\nnot granted across the board to all households, and why only  to\r\n\r\nHDB flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the take-up rate for cable television as at end\r\n\r\nJanuary 1999 was 18.5%.  After having made the entire nation\r\n\r\ncable ready, it would be a pity if only one in five homes were\r\n\r\nactually hooked up and it will be worthwhile to find out why the\r\n\r\nother four homes have not subscribed up to this point.  The aim\r\n\r\nshould be a 100% take-up rate either by cable or ADSL in the\r\n\r\nnear future.  Then, only then will Singapore ONE become a\r\n\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Chew Heng Ching spoke of the competition\r\n\r\nposed  by  SCV  and the foreign broadcasters  to  our  local  TV\r\n\r\nstations.   I  notice that Mr Low Thia Khiang took  a  diferring\r\n\r\nposition.   Our  local  broadcasters are  keenly  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetition.  In fact, we saw it coming, which was why we forced\r\n\r\nthe  corporatisation of SBC, preparing it for  long-term  future\r\n\r\nprivatisation.   We  knew  we  have  to  compete  in  a   fierce\r\n\r\nenvironment.   So  TCS  and  STV  12  gave  emphasis  to   local\r\n\r\nprogramming and I am glad to report to this House that  so  far,\r\n\r\nChannels  5,  8  and Prime 12 have been able to  maintain  their\r\n\r\ndominant  anchor  positions in the minds of Singaporeans.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are cabled up tell me that even  though  they\r\n\r\nhave  30  or 40 channels, somehow they still find most attracted\r\n\r\nto  our  English, Chinese, Malay programming, and  to  a  lesser\r\n\r\nextent,  our Indian programming.  I think that is a  good  sign.\r\n\r\nThey  are,  by  no  means, there yet.  They  have  got  to  keep\r\n\r\nplugging  away  and  make sure that they maintain  those  anchor\r\n\r\npositions  because  that is crucial to the preservation  of  our\r\n\r\nidentity as Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Malay and Tamil broadcastings clash and\r\n\r\ncompete  for prime time on Prime 12.  And because of this,  MITA\r\n\r\nhas decided that by the end of this year, we will separate Malay\r\n\r\nprogramming out to a separate channel.   STV 12 will  set  up  a\r\n\r\nseparate Malay channel so that Malay and Indian programming will\r\n\r\nno longer have to compete for prime slots as they now do.  Malay\r\n\r\nprogramming will remain on Prime 12, and its hours will increase\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n36.5  hours  per week to 43.5 hours.  We would then move  Indian\r\n\r\nprogramming to a new channel which will enjoy an additional  5.5\r\n\r\nhours  per  week of prime time.  This will go some  way  towards\r\n\r\nanswering some of Mr Rai's concerns.  As to whether we can  pump\r\n\r\nmore  public monies, which are licence fees plus the  15%  grant\r\n\r\nfrom  the Finance Ministry to Indian programming, I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  can justify it because this is really a zero sum game.  More\r\n\r\nmoney   for  Indian  programming  means  less  money  for  Malay\r\n\r\nprogramming   or   Chinese  programming   and   already   Indian\r\n\r\nprogramming on television and radio receives a disaproportionate\r\n\r\nshare of public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our TV stations have also gone into new multimedia\r\n\r\nplatforms like Internet and exploring the early introduction  of\r\n\r\ndigital  television.   Their  websites  are  very  popular   and\r\n\r\naccessed by Singaporeans and foreigners all over the world.  TCS\r\n\r\nand  STV  12  are committed to recruiting the best  broadcasting\r\n\r\nprofessionals  from  around the world.   Our  TV  networks  will\r\n\r\ncontinue with these strategies to remain competitive.  Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Media,  which  is  a  holding  company,  is   now\r\n\r\nreviewing its organisational structure to see how it can  better\r\n\r\nposition   our   TV  stations  for  an  even  more   competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Mr Chew Heng Ching, on the concerns which Mr\r\n\r\nLow said should not exist, I agree with Mr Chew that we must  be\r\n\r\nwatchful  that  the proliferation of foreign channels  does  not\r\n\r\nprevent  us from developing our own identity.  When we  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  way  the foreign channels have become part of the  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics in Malaysia and Indonesia, I think we should worry  for\r\n\r\nourselves.   If  we are not careful, foreign broadcasters,  like\r\n\r\nforeign  newspapers, can undermine some of our social and  other\r\n\r\npolicies,  for  example, our advertising  standards,  our  anti-smoking campaign and even our censorship norms.  A few may  even\r\n\r\nbe  tempted  to  interfere  in  Singapore's  domestic  politics,\r\n\r\nespecially before a general election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have always insisted on the Government's right of\r\n\r\nreply for newspapers and broadcasters which target Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  a media and broadcasting hub and we are  marketing\r\n\r\nourselves  to  be  such  a  hub,  and  in  recent  years,   many\r\n\r\ninternational  broadcasters have located  here.   Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  impose  minimal  conditions  on  transmissions  out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  because it is not for us to impose our  standards  on\r\n\r\nother people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for transmissions which are relayed to Singapore\r\n\r\nhouseholds, such as those channels which are now carried by SCV,\r\n\r\nand  later  by many other service providers as well,  we  should\r\n\r\nrequire  of  them  the  same standards as  we  impose  on  local\r\n\r\nbroadcasters.   For example, if you cannot advertise  cigarettes\r\n\r\non Channel 5 and 8, you should not be allowed to do so either on\r\n\r\na  foreign  channel carried by SCV or on Magix.   Those  foreign\r\n\r\nchannels  which have few local viewers should not  interest  us.\r\n\r\nThus, SBA takes little notice of the occasional nude scenes that\r\n\r\nyou find on French Channel 5 which is on SCV.  But channels with\r\n\r\nsignificant  local  audiences must be  put  on  the  same  level\r\n\r\nplaying field and, during election time, the rule of campaigning\r\n\r\nmust  apply to these channels as they apply to TCS and  STV  12.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  some  candidates may be  tempted  to  lobby  foreign\r\n\r\nchannels or even to buy air-time from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory framework for local broadcasters is, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not static.  With digitisation and the availability  of\r\n\r\nbandwidth, we have to adjust our position all the time, which we\r\n\r\nhave  done.   We have to flow with the tide in order  to  retain\r\n\r\nsome  freedom  for  ourselves.  We have to  maintain  a  certain\r\n\r\ndegree  of  autonomy and find our own separate identity  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, which we must if we are to remain competitive and  be  of\r\n\r\nservice  to  others.  Some people think that IT will  eventually\r\n\r\nmake all of us Americans one day.  I doubt it.  Yes, others also\r\n\r\nface  the  same  challenge, like the French,  the  Germans,  the\r\n\r\nJapanese and the Chinese.  But they are determined they will  be\r\n\r\nthemselves and retain their own separate identities and I  think\r\n\r\nwe should do so too.  But we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly do so by skilfully moving with the technology, not by being\r\n\r\nreactionary.   And  those Asian countries  which  cling  to  old\r\n\r\npositions  rigidly will be undermined and will be  swept  aside.\r\n\r\nBut we have got to play this game in a smarter way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan today and Mr Low Thia Khiang and many\r\n\r\nothers during the MND debate asked many questions about SCV  and\r\n\r\nwhy  is  it HDB flat owners are cabled up for free while  others\r\n\r\nhave  to pay some money.  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked why it was  SCV\r\n\r\nand  not  the Government who laid our cable network.  She  asked\r\n\r\nwhat  aspects  of SCV SBA regulates and how much  subsidies  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  laying the cable network.  She also asked  whether\r\n\r\nthere  will  be an alternative provider to SCV.  She also  asked\r\n\r\nwhy  SCV imposes different connection charges for HDB flats  and\r\n\r\nprivate property owners.  Because of the great interest shown in\r\n\r\nthis House at this Budget debate on SCV, I would like to make  a\r\n\r\ndetailed clarification of the issues raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Government agreed to let SCV lay an advanced\r\n\r\nisland-wide cable network by 1st January 2000, in return  for  a\r\n\r\nlimited 7-year monopoly on cable TV which will end in June 2002.\r\n\r\nThis  network is an important national infrastructure that could\r\n\r\nbe  used  not  only  for  cable  TV  but  also  for  interactive\r\n\r\nmultimedia services.  Because of technological and market risks,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  decided  that Singapore's  interests  are  best\r\n\r\nserved  by  having the project commercially driven.  Because  we\r\n\r\nwill not know how the technologies will change, how the policies\r\n\r\nwill  change, what new trends and new products will come to  be,\r\n\r\nit was better from the start to make it a commercial undertaking\r\n\r\nthan to develop it as a national infrastructure project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative of managing it as public infrastructure\r\n\r\nwould  have  made  it much less responsive to technological  and\r\n\r\nmarket  changes.  So, a private company was chosen  to  lay  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and provide services on a commercial basis.   The\r\n\r\nshareholders are SIM, SPH, Singapore Technologies and Media  One\r\n\r\nInternational, which is the third largest cable operator in  the\r\n\r\nUS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA regulates SCV on its cable roll-out plan, programming\r\n\r\nstandards, customer service and inter-connection issues but  not\r\n\r\nthe details of SCV subscription rates and cabling charges, which\r\n\r\nare quite complex.  While SCV has been given exclusive franchise\r\n\r\nin the provision of subscription TV, this exclusivity is limited\r\n\r\nboth  in  scope  and  in duration.  Let me  explain.   As  a  TV\r\n\r\ndistributor,  SCV faces strong competition from the  terrestrial\r\n\r\nchannels  provided by the SIM group of companies.  SBA  requires\r\n\r\nit  to carry most of the terrestrial channels for free, which is\r\n\r\nan  unusual  practice in the cable TV business.   SBA  has  also\r\n\r\nallowed  SingTel  to offer video on demand and  other  broadband\r\n\r\nservices  like  Magix.  SCV's monopoly position is  therefore  a\r\n\r\nlimited  one.   SCV's exclusive franchise is  for  7  years,  in\r\n\r\nexchange for which it is required to wire up the entire  island,\r\n\r\nregardless of take-up by Singaporeans.  In some countries,  such\r\n\r\nas  in  the  US,  cable operators may be given up  to  15  years\r\n\r\nexclusive franchise for cabling up households above the  ground.\r\n\r\nSCV  is  required to lay all cables underground which makes  the\r\n\r\nundertaking much more costly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is aware from the very outset that its financial outlay will\r\n\r\nbe  considerable while its monopoly position is short.  It knows\r\n\r\nthat  when its franchise ends in June 2002, the Government  will\r\n\r\nbe  allowing  other  subscription TV services,  both  wired  and\r\n\r\nwireless,  including satellite, to operate here.  SCV  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot  be  complacent and its strategy is therefore to  attract\r\n\r\nsubscribers for the long term.  Only if there are many long-term\r\n\r\nsubscribers can SCV hope to recover its investment  and  make  a\r\n\r\ndecent  return  on  shareholders' capital.  SCV  must  therefore\r\n\r\ncharge  cable  TV in a way which could win it a  large  base  of\r\n\r\nloyal long-term customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of cabling varies with the dwelling type. Hence, HDB\r\n\r\nflats are cheaper to cable up than private highrise which are in\r\n\r\nturn  cheaper  than  landed properties.  For landed  properties,\r\n\r\nagain it varies, whether it is a terrace or bungalow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSCV's cost of cabling up all HDB flats amounted to $242 million.\r\n\r\nThey  receive $60 million from HDB, being the amount  HDB  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay itself had it continued maintaining and  upgrading\r\n\r\nits  existing central antenna system in HDB estates. This  comes\r\n\r\nwith the flat, and HDB has an obligation to provide and maintain\r\n\r\nit  and  upgrade  it from time to time when new channels  become\r\n\r\navailable.  What HDB has done is to pass this buck to SCV and to\r\n\r\npay  SCV  the  amount it calculates it has to pay anyway  if  it\r\n\r\nundertook the responsibility for itself.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither HDB nor the Government subsidises SCV for cabling\r\n\r\nthe  estates.   SCV decided that the difference of $182  million\r\n\r\nwas  worth  incurring  because of the advantage  the  large  HDB\r\n\r\ncustomer  base would give it over future competitors  after  its\r\n\r\nmonopoly ends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condominium dwellers pay a rate of $150 for the first cable\r\n\r\npoint  or  $240  for the first two cable points.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\nexternal wiring amounting to some $25 million is absorbed  fully\r\n\r\nby SCV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the cabling of landed properties, SCV decided to divide them\r\n\r\ninto  two groups.  There are some 55,000 units, mostly terraces,\r\n\r\nsemi-detached houses and small bungalows, which are  located  in\r\n\r\nor  near mixed neighbourhoods, and they are near the main  cable\r\n\r\ntap off points, so that they are easier to wire up.  SCV's cost,\r\n\r\non  average, of cabling each of these homes, regardless of take-up,  is  about $2,300.  This means that if one out of two  homes\r\n\r\nsubscribes  to SCV, the cost of laying the cable per  subscriber\r\n\r\nis  $4,600,  compared  to  the  $2,300  which  SCV  charges  per\r\n\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of some 5,000 bungalows located in low-density areas further away from the main cable tap off points.\r\n\r\nThe  cost  of cabling such homes on average is $8,000 per  unit,\r\n\r\nagain  regardless of the take-up.  And if one in  two  bungalows\r\n\r\nsubscribes,  the  cost to cable each bungalow subscriber  is  in\r\n\r\nfact $16,000, because you have to go a long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway  to reach one home.  But in order to make it more attractive\r\n\r\nfor these households to subscribe, SCV decided to charge each of\r\n\r\nthese households about $6,000 in 2- or 3-year instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to SCV of cabling up all landed properties is $177\r\n\r\nmillion.  Hence, at a 50% take-up rate, SCV would have  to  bear\r\n\r\nsome  $97  million  in  cabling costs for landed  properties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  therefore  completely  untrue  that  landed\r\n\r\nproperty owners are subsidising condominium or HDB flat  owners.\r\n\r\nSCV has decided to absorb a higher loss per household for landed\r\n\r\nproperties as it believes that the take-up rate will  be  higher\r\n\r\namong  such households.  And this in fact has been borne out  by\r\n\r\ntheir  experience.   According to SCV, the  actual  subscription\r\n\r\nrate  is about 18% for HDB homes, less for 2- and 3-rooms,  more\r\n\r\nfor  4-  and 5-rooms and Executive flats; 35% for private  high-rise  homes and about 40% for landed estates.  This is  actually\r\n\r\nan  encouraging figure, given that our cable TV service  started\r\n\r\nonly  in  1995.  As a comparison, Hong Kong, which  started  its\r\n\r\ncable service  in 1993 has a take-up rate of 24%.  In the US, it\r\n\r\ntook 50 years to reach a 70% take-up rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not have been desirable for SBA to regulate the prices\r\n\r\ncharged  by  SCV.   Too  many factors were  involved,  too  many\r\n\r\nassumptions would have to be made.  SBA could at best  have  set\r\n\r\nceiling rates based on infrastructural cost recovery, but  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  explained,  SCV's  charges are well below  infrastructural\r\n\r\ncost recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September this year, SCV would have cabled up every home in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For  landed property, this means  a  cable  to  the\r\n\r\ncurbside.   SCV would then position itself to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe broadband network SCV has laid, which is a valuable asset to\r\n\r\nSCV.  Hence,  in  addition to subscription TV,  SCV  is  working\r\n\r\ntowards  the  commercial launch this year of a  high-speed  data\r\n\r\nservice  on cable modems, sometime at the end of this year.   It\r\n\r\nis  also  working  towards the provision of  broadband  services\r\n\r\nincluding integrated Internet telephony, video e-mail and video\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconferencing,  and all these will help to make Singapore  an  IT\r\n\r\nhub  in this part of the world.  This is from the Government and\r\n\r\nthe public perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From SCV's perspective, however, it is still not clear at all\r\n\r\nwhether or not it will make money.  When it negotiated the terms\r\n\r\nof  the  deal with the Government, Internet was not  yet  a  big\r\n\r\nfactor.   Now  it is, and all the calculations would  have  been\r\n\r\nquite different had they known of Internet coming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, all kinds of digital services provided by\r\n\r\ndifferent companies will be in fierce competition, and SCV  will\r\n\r\nbe one of many such competitors.  I would also like to assure Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang that even after Singapore has been  wired  up,\r\n\r\nfree-to-air broadcast will continue because many of  us  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  move,  in  trains, cars, buses.  There will  be  wristwatch\r\n\r\ntelevision sets or we may be in a boat.  We may be in  Johor  or\r\n\r\nBatam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin welcomed the launch of Channel News Asia, but\r\n\r\nmentioned   the reception problem faced by some of his residents\r\n\r\nin  Toa  Payoh East.  The vast majority of Singapore  homes  are\r\n\r\nconnected  to the cable network and can already receive  Channel\r\n\r\nNews  Asia  on  Channel 6.  There are, however,  about  800  HDB\r\n\r\nblocks which are unable to get Channel News Asia for up to three\r\n\r\nmonths,  because they are either at the tail-end of  cabling  or\r\n\r\nundergoing  HDB upgrading works.  SCV and HDB are  working  very\r\n\r\nhard  to  complete all the necessary work as soon  as  possible.\r\n\r\nTCS  is  also  working with the management of private  high-rise\r\n\r\nhomes on facilitating reception of Channel News Asia.  Residents\r\n\r\nof  landed  homes can seek assistance from TCS if they encounter\r\n\r\ndifficulties in receiving the new channel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also asked whether CNA intends to go regional. CNA hopes\r\n\r\nto  go  up  on  satellite within a year if there is  a  regional\r\n\r\nmarket,   which  I  think  there  should  be.    The   Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Foundation is also interested in folding  all  or\r\n\r\npart of Singapore international TV into Channel News Asia if  it\r\n\r\ngoes regional.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for setting up a similar channel in Mandarin, TCS will\r\n\r\nconsider it at a later stage if the commercial case for  such  a\r\n\r\nchannel   is  strong.   Channel  News  Asia  does  not   receive\r\n\r\nadditional funding from SBA for establishing this news  service.\r\n\r\nSo it is a commercial undertaking by TCS and the Government will\r\n\r\nnot bail it out if it turns out to be a failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about the plan to establish the Malay Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre at Kampong Glam.  I have on a number of occasions in this\r\n\r\nHouse mentioned that the Government would like to see the Istana\r\n\r\nat  Kampong Glam converted into a Malay Heritage Centre.  In May\r\n\r\n1993  during  the Budget debate, I informed the  House  that  Mr\r\n\r\nRidzwan  Dzafir was chairing a working group to look into  this.\r\n\r\nThe  working  group  subsequently made its  recommendations  and\r\n\r\nsince  then,  we  have had discussions with  various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.   And I am glad to now announce to the House  that  we\r\n\r\nare  able  to  take  concrete  steps towards  establishing  this\r\n\r\nCentre.   It  has taken us some time but it has been  worth  the\r\n\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will soon establish a Foundation to develop the Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage  Centre.   We  will  invite  leaders  from  the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  and others who are able to contribute to  take  part.\r\n\r\nMr  Ridzwan Dzafir has kindly agreed to be the Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nFoundation, and I do not think that we could have found a better\r\n\r\nman  for  the job.  He is a Boyanese himself.  He told  me  once\r\n\r\nthat the island where his ancestors came from, Pulau Bawaen,  in\r\n\r\nthe Java Sea, has a little kampong called Sangapura, named after\r\n\r\nSingapore, because of the large number of Boyanese who  migrated\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundation should aim to deepen our awareness of the history\r\n\r\nand culture of the Malays, and this heritage belongs not only to\r\n\r\nthe  Malay community but to all Singaporeans, to all of us.   In\r\n\r\nthis  effort, we should take a wider view of the history of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  the region and how the Malay community in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas come to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will provide two buildings in Kampong Glam for\r\n\r\nthe  Foundation to house the Centre, the Istana Kampong Glam  as\r\n\r\nwell as the building next to it, which is known as the Bendahara\r\n\r\nHouse.   The Government has just gazetted Bendahara House  today\r\n\r\nfor  acquisition for this purpose.  The Istana Kampong Glam,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, is State property, and has been so since  1897.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  will  first  restore  and  conserve  these  two\r\n\r\nhistoric buildings.  MITA will bear the renovation costs.  After\r\n\r\nrestoration  in  about 2-3 years' time, the  buildings  will  be\r\n\r\nhanded over to the Foundation to run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have announced to this House some years ago, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant  of  up  to  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the  establishment of a Heritage Centre  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund.  The Foundation will be encouraged to generate revenue  of\r\n\r\nits  own  and  to raise funds from corporate sponsors  and  from\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Support  for  the  Foundation  from   the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity will be crucial to its success.  And we hope that this\r\n\r\nCentre, when it is completed, will be a vibrant place which will\r\n\r\nengage  Singaporeans and show the diversity of our  heritage  to\r\n\r\nthe  world.  It should become one of our cultural anchor points,\r\n\r\nand it should also bring back life and activity to Kampong Glam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the Centre should reflect the history of\r\n\r\nKampong Glam. Being the seat of Malay royalty, it existed before\r\n\r\nRaffles  arrived.  After 1819, the Malay community in  Singapore\r\n\r\ngrew  rapidly  and  included  Arabs,  Indians,  Indian  Muslims,\r\n\r\nJavanese,  Buginese, Banjaris, Boyanese and others.  And  indeed\r\n\r\nthe  sense of a mixed community with diverse heritage  is  still\r\n\r\nevident  in  Kampong  Glam today, names  like  Arab  Street  and\r\n\r\nBussorah  Street. Separate sections in Kampong Glam accommodated\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups  like  Kampong Melaka, Kampong  Java,  Kampong\r\n\r\nBugis.   Till  today,  some of our best  Padang  restaurants  by\r\n\r\nMinang people are still to be found there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also Chinese stone masons and ironmongers,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  making Kampong Glam a truly cosmopolitan  district\r\n\r\nwith  its  own  distinct character.  And nearby  is  the  Sultan\r\n\r\nMosque,  which was planned for by Raffles, and it is interesting\r\n\r\nthat  till  today, the trustees of the Mosque must  include  two\r\n\r\nNorth Indians, two South Indians, two Malays, two Javanese,  two\r\n\r\nBuginese  and  two Arabs.  So very early, the community  decided\r\n\r\nthat it must ensure wide representation.  The Centre that we are\r\n\r\nestablishing should somehow capture that old spirit, and through\r\n\r\nthat  old  spirit,  continue  to link  the  Malay  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to all four corners of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Glam is to the Malay Muslim community in Singapore what\r\n\r\nChinatown is to the Chinese community.  Just as many Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  trace part of their ancestry back to  Chinatown,\r\n\r\nmany Malay Muslims in Singapore can trace part of their ancestry\r\n\r\nback  to  Kampong  Glam.  Recently, there was a  bit  of  public\r\n\r\ncommotion  over STB's plan to redevelop Chinatown.   It  created\r\n\r\nsome  inconveniences  to STB, but it was  a  very  good  debate,\r\n\r\nbecause it showed that Singaporeans have strong emotional  bonds\r\n\r\nto  the  land, and are concerned about what for them  is  sacred\r\n\r\nground  should be treated.   In fact, if Singaporeans had showed\r\n\r\nno  interest to the way Chinatown was being redeveloped, then we\r\n\r\nshould  worry,  because it would then mean that we  are  just  a\r\n\r\nhotel for Singaporeans, and Singaporeans are themselves rootless\r\n\r\ncitizens with no sense of where they come from and who they are.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  hope that the establishment of the Malay Heritage Centre\r\n\r\nat  the old Istana will anchor the living heritage of the  Malay\r\n\r\nMuslim community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Ho Tat Kin have urged MITA to give\r\n\r\nmore  money  to the arts, or to maintain the level  of  funding,\r\n\r\nbecause of the economic downturn.  I was very worried last  year\r\n\r\nthat  funding would dry up from the private sector, and some  of\r\n\r\nour  arts  groups would suffer great pain.  But, in  fact,  even\r\n\r\nthough companies could afford less, many made a great effort  to\r\n\r\nmaintain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  level  of  funding.  Every year, I write  letters  to  many\r\n\r\ncorporations  in  Singapore, begging for money  to  support  the\r\n\r\nannual festivals.  Usually, whenever they can, whether in  money\r\n\r\nor in kind, they would make the effort.  What this shows is that\r\n\r\nthe  support for the arts in Singapore is no longer only by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment but by a wide section of a community.  But  what  the\r\n\r\nNational Arts Council should do is to broaden this base further,\r\n\r\nand  bring the arts to all housing estates, so that the arts are\r\n\r\nalso  local and indigenous in character, and in the process also\r\n\r\nwiden the sponsorship base, the support base.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore asked the National Arts Council to seek out\r\n\r\nsmaller  donors and smaller sponsors, and which  is  why  I  was\r\n\r\ndelighted  by the proposal made by Mr Seng Han Thong and  others\r\n\r\nthat  we  should make the effort to win over local  businessmen.\r\n\r\nChinese  operas,  for a long time, back to colonial  days,  were\r\n\r\nsupported by local temples, clan associations, small businessmen\r\n\r\nand,  of course, seventh moon groups, which is why it is at  the\r\n\r\nseventh  moon  that  the most Chinese operas have  traditionally\r\n\r\nbeen shown.  So we should now find a way to build upon this fine\r\n\r\ntradition  in the HDB setting; modernise it,  build upon  it  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  seventh moon groups, our local businessmen, our  clan\r\n\r\nassociations, will continue to support the arts in  its  various\r\n\r\nforms.   But  to do that, we must reciprocate and give  national\r\n\r\nrecognition.  So the National Arts Council is now working out  a\r\n\r\nsystem of award for community sponsors and donors who give money\r\n\r\nto  the arts.  Right now, arts patrons have to give a minimum of\r\n\r\n$50,000  in  any one year.  That is a little bit  too  much  for\r\n\r\ncommunity  supporters.  We need maybe a new category  of  awards\r\n\r\nfor  our  community leaders so that every year  those  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  and  those who have made big bids at  seventh  moon\r\n\r\nauctions can then dress up and receive proper awards from  maybe\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the National Arts Council or the  Minister.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this is a very good idea.  I thank Mr Seng Han Thong  for\r\n\r\nit.   We will certainly work towards implementing it in the near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang said that the works of Pan Shou and other\r\n\r\nartists  should  be displayed in our museums and public  places.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  point also raised by Mr Peh Chin Hua.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nalways possible to have these works on permanent display because\r\n\r\nnowadays,  and  this  is  a worldwide trend,  museums  are  like\r\n\r\nshopping  centres.  Each visit should be a different experience.\r\n\r\nWhen  you  enter  the  main  hall, the  main  hall  should  look\r\n\r\ndifferent after a few months.  It should not be like in the  old\r\n\r\ndays  when  years after, people asked, \"Did you  see  the  whale\r\n\r\nbones  up  in the ceiling?\"  The artifacts were as permanent  as\r\n\r\nthey could be.  We do not have many square metres of good museum\r\n\r\nspaces.   So  we  have  got to keep grabbing  the  attention  of\r\n\r\naudiences  so  that they will come back again and  again.   They\r\n\r\npass  by,  they  have  got a bit of spare time,  it  is  raining\r\n\r\noutside,  they say, \"Let us go in and take a look.  Maybe  there\r\n\r\nis  something  on, something different.\"  This is  the  way  our\r\n\r\nmuseums  will  have  to  be,  using  multi-media,  using  modern\r\n\r\nmarketing  techniques in order to stay attractive  and  to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant.  So it is not easy for us to have a permanent display.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we have the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo, yes, I\r\n\r\nam  sure there will be a permanent space for these things.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  to  do  it  in  a judicious  way  without  boring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  or at the same time showing respect to  those  who\r\n\r\nhave made very important contributions to the local arts scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the proposal that we should try and rotate our exhibits\r\n\r\naround  to  the different Ministries and statutory boards  is  a\r\n\r\ngood one.  In fact, this has already been done.  The museums run\r\n\r\nan  arts bank and they rent out the exhibits, to MITA, to MTI or\r\n\r\nto  some statutory boards, in return for which they curate, they\r\n\r\ndo  the  wordings, they come and change the exhibits once  every\r\n\r\nyear  or two for a fee.  If private corporations are interested,\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  sure  the museums would be able  to  work  out  an\r\n\r\nattractive deal and an attractive package for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan Shou was not only a calligrapher. He was also a great\r\n\r\npoet.  It is important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat some of his poems are remembered by young Singaporeans.  So\r\n\r\nthe  National  Arts  Council is working on a collection  of  his\r\n\r\nbetter  poems  which  will be in the long Chinese  form  and  in\r\n\r\njianbizi  with hanyu pinyin, with word by word translations,  so\r\n\r\nthat  if you are a secondary school student, or if you are  like\r\n\r\nme, trying to appreciate his poems, you do not have to take up a\r\n\r\ndictionary and check the meaning of words.  Then it becomes  too\r\n\r\nmuch  of  an  effort.  You sit down, you will be able  to  read,\r\n\r\nlearn  and  enjoy  the meaning and the spirit of  the  poem,  in\r\n\r\neither  English or Chinese.  This is something which  should  be\r\n\r\ndone this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai urged MITA to preserve buildings and to\r\n\r\nhave more plaques for historically important buildings.  This is\r\n\r\nan  on-going  programme.  What the Heritage Board together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Heritage Society tries to do, every year, is to  mark  more\r\n\r\nsites in Singapore so that Singapore is an island littered  with\r\n\r\nmemories,  our  finger  prints and  the  finger  prints  of  our\r\n\r\nancestors all over.  A park is not just a park.  A park was also\r\n\r\nthe  setting for some important events in the past.  Then  every\r\n\r\nplace   becomes  an  interesting  place,  otherwise   we   build\r\n\r\nsomething,  we  clear it, we build something  else,  we  are  no\r\n\r\nbetter than a theme park or a hotel.  If we keep on doing  that,\r\n\r\nwithout  leaving  behind memories, without planting  our  roots,\r\n\r\nSingapore will never become a home for Singaporeans.  This is  a\r\n\r\nwork of generations.  Every year we must do some and I thank  Mr\r\n\r\nRai for his excellent suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, what we do for Singaporeans we are proud to show to\r\n\r\ntourists.   If we can make some money for the tourism  industry,\r\n\r\nthat  is  wonderful.  Which is why the Singapore  Tourism  Board\r\n\r\nsupports  many  heritage projects.  In many countries,  heritage\r\n\r\ntourism  is  important.  You read a brochure, it  says,  \"Second\r\n\r\nWorld War fortification, the Percival Headquarters for Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia, come take a look.\"  A tourist may be attracted to spend an\r\n\r\nadditional  half-a-day  or  a  day  in  order  to  explore   the\r\n\r\nfortification.    That  is  good  business   for   hotels,   for\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,   for   restaurants,  for  businessmen   who   sell\r\n\r\nsouvenirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng gave a very thoughtful contribution on\r\n\r\nthe  relationship between culture and entrepreneurship.  He  was\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy with the fact that sometimes we look down  on  our\r\n\r\nown  values, that anything associated with Confucianism must  be\r\n\r\nbad.   We  have many western friends who also tell  us  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  inherited  bad values and bad habits from  our  own  past,\r\n\r\nwhich we should shed quickly, and perhaps become more like them.\r\n\r\nThat  is not a very historical view of things.  Of course, there\r\n\r\nwere  things  in our Confucianist past for Chinese  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwhich  held us back, like the treatment of women, foot  binding,\r\n\r\nthe emplacement of businessmen at the bottom of the social totem\r\n\r\npole.  All that kept back the development of enterprise and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a free business spirit.  But there  were  other\r\n\r\naspects  of our ancestral culture which are valuable to  us  and\r\n\r\nwhich  account for a lot of the success of Singapore today,  our\r\n\r\nhigh   savings  rate,  our  emphasis,  almost  obsession,   with\r\n\r\neducation,  strong  family unit, hard  work,  thrift,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nvalues  which  we cling on even more dearly in a crisis.   Those\r\n\r\nthings we should not lightly weaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang talked about how Chinese and Indian groups\r\n\r\nperform  differently in different settings.  There is a cultural\r\n\r\nimpulse  which is a potential and in certain political settings,\r\n\r\nthe  potential flowers, blooms, like in Silicon Valley, like  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  like  in  Taiwan,  like  in  Singapore.   In  other\r\n\r\nsettings, like under socialism in India, or communism in  China,\r\n\r\nit  was  suppressed.  So before the war, Shanghai, when  it  was\r\n\r\nmostly  foreign  concessions, was the greatest city  in  all  of\r\n\r\nAsia.   Under  communism, it became gray and dark.  With  reform\r\n\r\nand  opening  up, it is blossoming again.  This shows  that  the\r\n\r\nunderlying cultural potential was always there, which is  why  I\r\n\r\nam  not  particularly concerned that we have no  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit  in  Singapore.   It is in our  history,  it  is  in  our\r\n\r\nculture,  it is in our blood.  But what we must do is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat    our   rules   and   regulations   better   enable   this\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  spirit  to  come forth  in  the  new  high-tech\r\n\r\nknowledge economic setting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is, of course, what the Technopreneurship 21 Committee  is\r\n\r\nabout,  and  about which I spoke a bit this morning  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate on MTI.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Satellite dishes require  line\r\n\r\nof  sight, which means you cannot have it if you live in a high-rise  apartment  block.   If you have one  satellite  dish,  you\r\n\r\naccess one satellite, you may not get all the channels that  you\r\n\r\nwant.  Furthermore, even after you have got the satellite  dish,\r\n\r\nyou  have still to cable it to your home.  So it is not  as   if\r\n\r\nsatellite represents a cheap alternative.  It is far better  for\r\n\r\nus,  economically speaking, to see the whole of Singapore as one\r\n\r\nlarge  condominium satellite with big satellite  dishes  pulling\r\n\r\ndown  channels  from  all over the world  and  then  feeding  it\r\n\r\nthrough a cable system and through wireless systems to different\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  office blocks, schools and so  on.   This  was  the\r\n\r\nmodel that we adopted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we allow the free use of satellite one day? We\r\n\r\nalready  allow it for banks and companies.  We have  decided  to\r\n\r\nhold back on households in order to buy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nourselves more time for local programming to take root.

Of course, a cable system, if there is  a  national\r\n\r\nemergency,  or if there is an SAF mobilisation, is  very  useful\r\n\r\nfor these purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> On the\r\n\r\nmillennium  celebrations, I think Mr Chew  is  right  in  saying\r\n\r\nthat,  strictly speaking, the new millennium is not in the  Year\r\n\r\n2000,  but  in  the  Year 2001.  Even a person  like  Arthur  C.\r\n\r\nClarke,  the  famous science fiction writer, feels  so  strongly\r\n\r\nabout people calling next year a new millennium that he issued a\r\n\r\npublic  statement  to correct it because the Gregorian  calendar\r\n\r\nstarts  with Year 1 and not Year 0.  The 21st century  does  not\r\n\r\nactually  begin until 1st January 2001.  Nonetheless,  the  year\r\n\r\n2000  has a profound psychological effect on many of us and  our\r\n\r\nsense  of  time.  Most countries have indicated that they  would\r\n\r\ncelebrate the millennium. Do we intend to do so?  Yes.  Together\r\n\r\nwith  the rest of the world, Singapore will welcome the new year\r\n\r\nwith a host of events.  MITA is coordinating these events, which\r\n\r\nare organised by both public and private sectors.  Starting this\r\n\r\nmonth, they will span 18 months.  These events will mostly  ride\r\n\r\non  existing programmes such as the Arts Festival, the  National\r\n\r\nDay Parade and the usual year-end light-ups and countdown shows.\r\n\r\nThe incremental expenditure should not be significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong will launch the Singapore Millennium 2000\r\n\r\nLogo  on  20th  March 1999 together with Singapore's  Millennium\r\n\r\nwebsite.  The logo will serve as a visual unifier for the  whole\r\n\r\nrange  of nation wide celebrations, with its accompanying slogan\r\n\r\n\"A  Shared  Heritage,  A  Common Vision\".   Some  of  the  other\r\n\r\nactivities include commemorative markers, such as time  capsule,\r\n\r\nsculpture  and a Millennium clock.  Millennium coins and  stamps\r\n\r\nand a new series of currency notes will also be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissued.   A  number of countdown shows at various parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland  are also being planned.  These bashes will set the  mood\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  to  ring in the new century  as  one  people.\r\n\r\nDetails  of the festivities have been announced and reported  in\r\n\r\nboth local and foreign media.  Time magazine, Sir, for instance,\r\n\r\ncarried a positive report on our proposed festivities.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe report [indicating] that appeared in the Time magazine.  And\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute them  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers?  [Copies of report distributed to hon. Members.]   More\r\n\r\ninformation will be found in the Millennium website and released\r\n\r\nto the media in the course of the year.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the promotion of film industry, Mr Chew Heng Ching and\r\n\r\nMr  Shriniwas Rai spoke of promising prospects of the local film\r\n\r\nindustry and called for more incentives to help film makers.  Mr\r\n\r\nPeh  Chin Hua said that TCS should produce more local films  and\r\n\r\nshow them in cinemas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the success of Money No Enough last year, things are\r\n\r\nlooking  good  for our local film industry.  Liang  Po  Po  made\r\n\r\nquite  a  successful debut recently, and it is reported that  12\r\n\r\nother films will be released this year.  Incentives such as  the\r\n\r\nPioneer  Incentive  Scheme  and the  Development  and  Expansion\r\n\r\nIncentive,  which allow tax holiday of 5% to 10%, or  a  reduced\r\n\r\ntax rate, have been offered.  A few companies were awarded these\r\n\r\nincentives  in the early 1990s but there were not  enough  films\r\n\r\nbeing made then.  Today, there is greater optimism.  People  are\r\n\r\nseeking  for  new  ideas, looking for new locations,  trying  to\r\n\r\nangle into the new growing industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, the Singapore Film Commission has set up\r\n\r\ncommittees to help film makers.  A Funding Committee will invest\r\n\r\nup  to $1 million on four feature films and $200,000 on 40 short\r\n\r\nfilms  every  year.  It recently awarded some  $300,000  to  two\r\n\r\nlocal  film-makers, quite a big amount for  our  standard.   The\r\n\r\nFilm Commission will also support the development of good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscripts.   Noted script doctors have been invited to run  script\r\n\r\nseminars  and script laboratories in Singapore to encourage  the\r\n\r\ngrowth or the production of better script writers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Facilitation Committee will help film-makers by making it\r\n\r\neasier  for  them  to obtain permits for location  shooting  and\r\n\r\nother  necessary  requirements  from  Government  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  This  Committee will also help run courses  to  educate\r\n\r\nfilm-makers  on  the legal and business aspects of  film-making.\r\n\r\nThey  are  also  looking  to  develop  and  widen  the  pool  of\r\n\r\ntechnicians, such as lighting and camera people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai said that he was impressed by what he saw and what\r\n\r\nthe Australians are doing.  In actual fact, we have sent a study\r\n\r\ngroup to places outside Singapore, including Australia.  So  the\r\n\r\nFilm  Commission,  from the experience of the visits  that  were\r\n\r\nmade,  will  work with the Economic Development  Board  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant agencies to help the industry such as in the setting up\r\n\r\nof  post-production  facilities  and  granting  of  further  tax\r\n\r\nincentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that world-wide, film-making is a risky\r\n\r\nbusiness  as no one can predict whether a film will  succeed  or\r\n\r\nfail  at  the  box  office.  But I am hopeful that  with  proper\r\n\r\nplanning  and  encouragement, Singapore can  become  a  regional\r\n\r\ncentre for the film industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Peh's comment on TCS' film-making\r\n\r\nventure, we welcome the move.  TCS' Raintree company, which  has\r\n\r\nwidely advertised in our local TV, has produced its first  movie\r\n\r\nLiang  Po  Po, which was a success at the box office.  There  is\r\n\r\ncertainly synergy between the TV and film industries,  not  just\r\n\r\nin  terms of the common pool of talent and actors that they  all\r\n\r\nshare,  but  also  in terms of the supporting industries.   TCS'\r\n\r\nmove will therefore result in a more vibrant media scene.  MITA,\r\n\r\nof course, will continue giving its support wherever it can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Red Lion National icon, Dr Toh See Kiat feels that there\r\n\r\nis a need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulate  the use of the Lion icon, which is our national  icon.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Lion symbol, introduced in 1986, has been  widely\r\n\r\npublicised,  used and accepted as our national  symbol.   It  is\r\n\r\nincluded in MITA's National Symbols kit where guidelines on  its\r\n\r\nuse are given.  The symbol is already protected under Rule 14 of\r\n\r\nour Trade Marks Rules and internationally under Article 6 of the\r\n\r\nParis Convention.  Only Government organisations are allowed  to\r\n\r\nuse  the symbol.  Other organisations wishing to use the  symbol\r\n\r\nmust  seek MITA's permission.  We are constantly looking at ways\r\n\r\nto  promote its usage in keeping with its image as our  national\r\n\r\nsymbol.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, I want to talk on dialect broadcasting.\r\n\r\nWith  news  being broadcast in dialect, our senior citizens  are\r\n\r\nnow  kept  well  informed  of local international  developments.\r\n\r\nWhat  is more important is that the senior citizens are able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand Government policies from news which they can hear for\r\n\r\nthemselves   rather  than  having  to  listen  to  third   party\r\n\r\ntranslations, which very often are not the exact.  Dialect  news\r\n\r\nbroadcast  has  been well received.  Currently, with  cable  TV,\r\n\r\nthere is sufficient bandwidth to provide more dialect programmes\r\n\r\nfor old people.  MITA could encourage more dialect programmes to\r\n\r\nbe  broadcast, especially in the day time, for senior  citizens,\r\n\r\nas  it  is  the time when their children are at work and  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  need entertainment.  Dialect opera and classic  movies\r\n\r\nwill be welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current widespread use of Mandarin among the younger\r\n\r\ngeneration, the problem of dialect diluting Mandarin will be non-existent.  I hope the Minister can consider this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I go on to digital broadcasting. To position at the\r\n\r\nforefront  of  technology,  we  are  committed  to  embrace  new\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  continue to improve all forms of  services  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  This is the same for broadcasting.  Digital audio\r\n\r\nbroadcast (DBA) is the latest buzzword in the radio industry and\r\n\r\nhas been labelled the sound of the future offering interference-free, CD quality sound, graphic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npictures  and  text  information in addition to  audio  signals.\r\n\r\nThis  means useful information like traffic and weather reports,\r\n\r\nheadline news, including leisure and financial information,  can\r\n\r\nbe transmitted via DBA for listeners' benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA has announced Singapore's commitment to implement digital\r\n\r\nradio  and  digital TV.  These are key technologies  which  will\r\n\r\npropel  the  local broadcasting industry into the  digital  age.\r\n\r\nThis   will  give  consumers  more  programming  choices,  offer\r\n\r\nnewsreels  for broadcast and enhance Singapore's position  as  a\r\n\r\nbroadcasting hub.  Digital audio broadcast has been launched  on\r\n\r\na limited scale.  I believe we have offered Asia's first digital\r\n\r\naudio broadcast service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what is the result of this launch and\r\n\r\nwhen will the full launch be implemented?  I would also like  to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister the results of the digital television test  to\r\n\r\nstudy the three technical standards currently available.  Has  a\r\n\r\nconclusion  been reached as to which standard is  most  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore?   When  will digital television  be  rolled  out\r\n\r\neventually and how long will it be before analogue TV is  phased\r\n\r\nout totally?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the importance of Internet has been\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Government for some time now.  And I am  proud\r\n\r\nto  say that Singapore is widely recognised by the international\r\n\r\ncommunity as being at the forefront of developing an intelligent\r\n\r\nisland,  with  the  various initiatives such  as  Singapore  One\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our current approach to tackling the Internet problem is a\r\n\r\nmulti-agency  one.   We have progressed thus  far  with  various\r\n\r\ninitiatives  by  the universities to promote  the  teaching  and\r\n\r\nusage  of  Internet, Ministry of Education on  the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nInternet  among students in schools, EDB working  with  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  promote  e-commerce and  to  develop  web-related\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  NCB  on  developing an Internet  culture,  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Broadcasting Authority on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulation of Internet, and so on.  Like it or not, Internet has\r\n\r\nbecome  part and parcel of our life, be it at work, at home,  or\r\n\r\nin  dealing  with  the  Government.  This  current  multi-agency\r\n\r\napproach to tackling the Internet problem may not be a good one.\r\n\r\nI  feel a need for an overall body to coordinate the regulation,\r\n\r\npromotion,  development, teaching and the usage of  Internet  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This will help ensure that our limited resources are\r\n\r\nnot duplicated and that there is a more coordinated approach  to\r\n\r\nachieve  Internet  development, instead of just  leaving  it  to\r\n\r\nindividual agencies to chart up individual road maps  which  may\r\n\r\nnot have the same benefits as a more systematic coordinated plan\r\n\r\nin place for the whole country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister for Finance had two days ago\r\n\r\nannounced  the  possibility of forming an IT  coordinating  body\r\n\r\ncomprising NCB, TAS and SBA.  I would like to propose that  this\r\n\r\nbody  take  on the task of promoting, regulating and  developing\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  industry.  I would venture to suggest  that  this\r\n\r\nbody comes under the purview of MITA, the Ministry in charge  of\r\n\r\ninformation.  I would like the Minister's comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, since I entered this House in 1997, I\r\n\r\nhave  been calling for the establishment of a Ministry  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the multifarious aspects of information technology  policy\r\n\r\nplanning and development in Singapore.  Recently I was fortified\r\n\r\nin  my  stand by the discovery that the outgoing Chief Executive\r\n\r\nof  the National Computer Board, Mr Stephen Yeo, shared my view.\r\n\r\nI  was equally encouraged by Mrs Yu-Foo's call in this House  on\r\n\r\nMonday  for a Ministry of IT Power.  I am thus no longer a  lone\r\n\r\nvoice  in  the  wilderness.  To top it  all,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance's reply to her was the most encouraging piece of news  I\r\n\r\nhave  had  this  year.  Yes, even though the Government  is  not\r\n\r\nconvinced that a Ministry for IT (by whatever name it is called)\r\n\r\nis  needed,  it has acknowledged that some streamlining  of  the\r\n\r\nregulatory agencies is possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties of pigeon-holing different aspects of IT\r\n\r\npolicy to different agencies and Ministries is exemplified\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  my  recent call in this House for the regulation of Internet\r\n\r\nRelay  Chat  facilities.  I had been alarmed to  hear  that  two\r\n\r\ngirls had been raped and/or molested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to say that when I asked the question on the\r\n\r\nInternet  Relay  Chat facilities, I had asked for  clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  at  least two Ministries.  Actually I had even thought  of\r\n\r\nfiling a Question for the third Ministry because this had to  do\r\n\r\nwith communication infrastructure.  I do remember that last year\r\n\r\nwhen  the APEC Ministers discussed electronic commerce, we  were\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan,  who  is  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications, even though electronic commerce is more an issue\r\n\r\nwhich is governed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and  the\r\n\r\nNational Computer Board which is an agency under MTI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, even though I do disagree somewhat with the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reply  earlier in this House  that  IRCs  cannot  be\r\n\r\nregulated, I think more education can be given to get parents to\r\n\r\nknow  that uncontrolled Internet use by their children can  lead\r\n\r\nto  problems and they must actually not use the excuse that they\r\n\r\nknow nothing about Internet and ignore what the children do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also suggest that perhaps we have this special service\r\n\r\nwhich currently is only operated by SingNet but we can open  it,\r\n\r\nmaybe  even  on  a mandatory basis, to all the Internet  Service\r\n\r\nProviders, and this Family Safe Internet Service would not  only\r\n\r\nscreen  off pornography for children but also other things  like\r\n\r\nInternet  Relay Chat facilities that parents can switch  off  if\r\n\r\nthey do not consider it wholesome for their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all technology, the Internet can be used for good as well\r\n\r\nas  for  bad.  We need to avoid what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has called\r\n\r\n\"kiasu\" regulation yesterday in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

That  we\r\n\r\nwill do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital audio broadcasting, it is already available. The\r\n\r\ntrade launch has been done, and the commercial launch should  be\r\n\r\nin  July  this  year.

I do not think MITA will be a good place to locate  such\r\n\r\nan   agency,   because  regulating  the  technical  aspects   of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication and information technology is a big job  which\r\n\r\nis best given to a technical Ministry rather than to MITA.  MITA\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be interested in social and cultural  content,\r\n\r\nboth  its regulation and its promotion, in conformance with  our\r\n\r\npolicies on censorship, language or whatever.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
