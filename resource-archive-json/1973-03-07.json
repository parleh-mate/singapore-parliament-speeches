The   Board   was\r\n\r\nestablished   on   1st  March,  1957,   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Light Dues Ordinance,  1957,  and\r\n\r\nis responsible for the provision and maintenance of\r\n\r\nmarine navigational aids. The Board, which consists\r\n\r\nof  a  Chairman  and eight members,  operates  five\r\n\r\nlighthouses,  and some Ill beacons and  buoys.  The\r\n\r\noperation,    maintenance   and   improvement    of\r\n\r\nnavigational aids for the safe navigation of  ships\r\n\r\nin  Singapore waters is clearly a port function and\r\n\r\nshould  logically come under the ambit of the  Port\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   Authority  (PSA)   which   has   a\r\n\r\nHydrographic  Department dealing  with  surveys  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  waters. The Hydrographic Department,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with the Port Master's  Department  of\r\n\r\nthe PSA, determines the location and recommends the\r\n\r\ntype  of  navigational aids to be established.

The operational functions  of  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Department include the licensing of harbour\r\n\r\ncraft,   port   clearance,  the  dissemination   of\r\n\r\nnavigational  information  and  the   recovery   of\r\n\r\nwrecks.   These   functions  should   properly   be\r\n\r\nexercised by the Port of Singapore Authority  (PSA)\r\n\r\nwhose  Port  Master is responsible for the  seaward\r\n\r\ncontrol of the harbour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nharbour   safety,   tug  services,   berthing   and\r\n\r\npiloting,  as well as the supervision and direction\r\n\r\nof ships and shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime objective of this Bill is to rationalise\r\n\r\nthe  distribution of maritime functions between the\r\n\r\nMarine  Department and the PSA. The  Bill  proposes\r\n\r\nthe  transfer  of  the following functions  of  the\r\n\r\nMarine Department to the PSA:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i) Licensing of harbour craft (Clause 12(a))</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA to have jurisdiction over the licensing of\r\n\r\nharbour  craft  which operate  solely  within  port\r\n\r\nlimits.  Harbour craft are operated by certificated\r\n\r\nsteersmen   and  the  examination  and   issue   of\r\n\r\ncertificates  to  steersmen would then  become  the\r\n\r\nPSA's responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Port entry and clearance (Clause 12 (c))</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since control of shipping in port is the PSA's\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  it  is  only  logical  that   this\r\n\r\nfunction  is also exercised by the PSA.  This  will\r\n\r\nalso    simplify   the   collection   of   shipping\r\n\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii)  Dissemination  of  navigational  information (Clause 3 (b) paragraph (e))</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the Marine Department issues notices to\r\n\r\nmariners  while the Port Master issues  notices  to\r\n\r\nships in the harbour. Since the PSA will take  over\r\n\r\nthe  provision and maintenance of navigational aids\r\n\r\nand  is also responsible for hydrographic work, the\r\n\r\ndissemination  of  navigational information  should\r\n\r\nproperly also be a function of the PSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iv) Recovery of wrecks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Director of Marine is officially the\r\n\r\nreceiver  of  wrecks,  actual  wreck  recovery   is\r\n\r\nundertaken by the PSA or by private firms since the\r\n\r\nMarine  Department has no salvage facilities.  This\r\n\r\nfunction should be the responsibility of the PSA as\r\n\r\nit relates to harbour safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA will also take over from the Singapore\r\n\r\nLight  Dues Board the responsibility for  provision\r\n\r\nand maintenance of navigational aids for the safe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnavigation of ships in Singapore waters  (clause  3\r\n\r\n(b) paragraph (d)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of these functions which deal with\r\n\r\nshipping  activities  within  the  port,  from  the\r\n\r\nMarine Department to the PSA, is a logical move and\r\n\r\nis  indeed necessary as a consequence of the growth\r\n\r\nof  shipping in our port. When these functions  are\r\n\r\ntransferred to the PSA, the Marine Department  will\r\n\r\nbe   able  to  concentrate  on  specialised  marine\r\n\r\nmatters so that Singapore's maritime interests  are\r\n\r\neffectively advanced. This will enable us  to  take\r\n\r\ngreater  advantage of our strategic location  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor  shipping  and trade centre.  The  Department\r\n\r\nwould be able to exert more efforts to enhance  the\r\n\r\nattractiveness of the Singapore Registry  of  Ships\r\n\r\nby  providing  more efficient service  to  the  800\r\n\r\nships,  totalling some 1.7 million gross registered\r\n\r\ntons, at present flying the Singapore flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to make other amendments\r\n\r\nto  the  Port of Singapore Authority Act, generally\r\n\r\nto  tighten  control of activities  and  operations\r\n\r\nwithin  port waters. The Bill will enable the  Port\r\n\r\nto  effectively  supervise the users  of  the  seas\r\n\r\naround Singapore to ensure that they do not pollute\r\n\r\nthe  seas  or rivers or cause navigational  hazards\r\n\r\n(clause 13). The PSA will also be empowered to levy\r\n\r\nrates  for  removal  of  oil  pollution  and  other\r\n\r\nservices,  and  to  levy  dues,  including  garbage\r\n\r\nremoval  dues. Existing sections dealing with  dues\r\n\r\nand  rates  are  replaced with  more  comprehensive\r\n\r\nprovisions to enable the PSA to charge proper  dues\r\n\r\nand rates (clause 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Schedule to the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority  Act  is  also  amended  to  reduce   the\r\n\r\nmembership of the PSA from 14 to 9 and to make  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  office  more flexible  (clause  18).  A\r\n\r\ncompact  Board  will  be  able  to  discharge   its\r\n\r\nfunctions   more   effectively  and  expeditiously.\r\n\r\nPresent  members will continue to serve until  they\r\n\r\ncomplete their terms of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the PSA will achieve the basic\r\n\r\nobjective of this reorganisation exercise which  is\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neliminate wastage of manpower and resources, and to\r\n\r\nensure  greater efficiency and better co-ordination\r\n\r\nof personnel dealing with related shipping matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The\r\n\r\npurpose  is to ensure that ships especially tankers\r\n\r\nwhich have suffered casualty may not be allowed  to\r\n\r\ncome in if there is risk of massive oil pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Department staff, who are required to\r\n\r\nbe  transferred  to the service of  the  PSA  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this  exercise, will be transferred  on\r\n\r\nterms  as near as may be to those they had  enjoyed\r\n\r\nimmediately prior to their transfer (clause 45).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that all these changes will enhance\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of the Port.

This  Bill,  now\r\n\r\nbefore   the  House,  seeks  to  provide  for   the\r\n\r\nlicensing, control and supervision of creches so as\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the education, health, safety  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  young children who are  sent  to  such\r\n\r\ncreches are adequately taken care of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent enquiries made by the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  revealed  that  a  number  of   private\r\n\r\ncreches are operating in residential areas.  A  few\r\n\r\nof   these  creches  offer  day-care  service   for\r\n\r\npreschool  children, and in addition some  of  them\r\n\r\noffer   residential  care  for  infants  and  young\r\n\r\nchildren.   Some  of  these  private  creches   are\r\n\r\noperated by untrained or unqualified staff. Most of\r\n\r\nthese  creches  charge considerably high  fees  for\r\n\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for day-care facilities for children is\r\n\r\nexpected to increase in view of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) greater job opportunities for women, arising\r\n\r\nfrom    rapid   industrialisation   and    economic\r\n\r\nexpansion, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the shortage of \"baby amahs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith  the trend towards smaller family units living\r\n\r\nin  compact high-rise flats where other members  of\r\n\r\ntheir  extended family are not so readily available\r\n\r\nto  render  them any assistance, those families  in\r\n\r\nwhich  both  the husband and wife have to  be  away\r\n\r\nfrom  their homes to work elsewhere in the day will\r\n\r\nhave  to  rely more and more on child-care services\r\n\r\nfrom  outside the home.

In fact, one leading industrial firm has\r\n\r\nalready  approached  the Social Welfare  Department\r\n\r\nfor advice and assistance to set up a creche in its\r\n\r\npremises for children of its female employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the expected increase in the number of\r\n\r\nprivate  creches,  there should be  some  means  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling  and  supervising  these  creches.   At\r\n\r\npresent,   there   is   no   Government   authority\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   the  licensing,   control   and\r\n\r\nsupervision  of private creches, nor is  there  any\r\n\r\nlegislation   on  the  matter.  It   is   therefore\r\n\r\nessential    that   appropriate   legislation    be\r\n\r\nintroduced   as  soon  as  possible,  setting   out\r\n\r\nappropriate  standards  for the  establishment  and\r\n\r\noperation  of creches, to ensure that the interests\r\n\r\nof   the  children  attending  these  creches   are\r\n\r\nadequately  safeguarded. It is  also  necessary  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the public is not exploited by  creche\r\n\r\noperators  through the inadequacies or  neglect  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the operators or through the collection\r\n\r\nof excessively high fees. On the other hand, laying\r\n\r\ndown the standards and rules for establishment  and\r\n\r\noperation of a creche will facilitate and help  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  or  any  individual  to  plan  and\r\n\r\noperate any proposed creche establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these reasons, my Ministry has proposed\r\n\r\nthe  enactment of this legislation.  The  views  of\r\n\r\nconcerned  Government  Departments,  including  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of  Health, Education and  Labour,  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department and  the  Singapore  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade, have been sought and incorporated  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.

Members\r\n\r\nwill note that under the Bill a \"creche\" is defined\r\n\r\nas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"any premises where children under the age of six\r\n\r\nyears  are received, whether for reward or not,  to\r\n\r\nbe looked after during the whole or part of the day\r\n\r\nor  night  but does not include nursing  homes  and\r\n\r\nmaternity homes as defined in the Nursing Homes and\r\n\r\nMaternity  Homes  Registration  Act  and  preschool\r\n\r\ninstitutions  registered  with  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A main provision in the Bill is to make it an\r\n\r\noffence  for any person to operate a creche without\r\n\r\na  licence,  thus disallowing any sub-standard  and\r\n\r\nimproper  creches  to  be  established.  The   Bill\r\n\r\nprovides,  inter  alia, for the  appointment  of  a\r\n\r\nLicensing Officer and Assistant Licensing Officers,\r\n\r\nthe  manner of the application for the licence, the\r\n\r\nduration  of  the  licence and  the  inspection  of\r\n\r\ncreche  premises.  In  addition,  it  empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make  regulations to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\npurposes and provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing number of creches being\r\n\r\nestablished or to he established and to protect the\r\n\r\ninterests of the young children who will be sent to\r\n\r\nsuch  creches,  there is a pressing need  to  enact\r\n\r\nthis  legislation in order to license, control  and\r\n\r\nsupervise establishment of creches on the one hand,\r\n\r\nand to provide some guidelines for creche operators\r\n\r\nto follow by, on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  listened  with  interest to  the  commendable\r\n\r\nobjectives  of this Bill, now being read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime  by the Parliamentary Secretary.

Basically, this is another example  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  good  measures in looking  after  our\r\n\r\nyoung citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Social Welfare Department has already\r\n\r\nbeen  running some creches for the care of children\r\n\r\nof  working women, most of them are situated in the\r\n\r\ncity areas. Children of working women living in the\r\n\r\nkampungs are therefore not being looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the process of rapid industrialisation, we\r\n\r\nneed  more  and more creches because many factories\r\n\r\nneed   more  female  workers.  Married  women   are\r\n\r\ntherefore encouraged to come out of the kitchen  to\r\n\r\njoin the production team so as to take part in  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme.  This   is   not   to\r\n\r\nencourage them to rebel against their husbands, but\r\n\r\nto  enhance  their  social and  economic  position.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  this will help to increase our  national\r\n\r\nproduction  and economic progress. Therefore,  this\r\n\r\nis a wise measure on the part of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most housewives are faced with the problem of\r\n\r\ncaring  for  their children in their  absence,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  also  the difficulty  of  getting  \"baby\r\n\r\namahs\".  Similarly, many women who are occupied  in\r\n\r\nother fields of work, including teachers, also need\r\n\r\nto  put their children in creches so that they  can\r\n\r\ndevote  more time to their work. Therefore, on  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  this  Bill,  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider setting up more creches  in\r\n\r\nmore  areas, particularly in industrial and private\r\n\r\nresidential  areas, including Jurong and  Sembawang\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  because this will help  housewives\r\n\r\nto  join in the industrialisation programme, and to\r\n\r\nreduce the dependence on \"baby amahs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, what the Parliamentary Secretary  had\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now,  relating to the establishment  of\r\n\r\nmore creches, is very good. I give my whole support\r\n\r\nto this Bill. But on the one hand, he has said that\r\n\r\nhe wants better facilities in these creches, and on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand  he has said that the  expenditure\r\n\r\nshould  not  be too high. We cannot have  both,  of\r\n\r\ncourse.  If  we  can achieve one objective,  it  is\r\n\r\nalready  good enough. So I hope that when the  Bill\r\n\r\nis  put  into  effect,  the  Government  would  not\r\n\r\ninterfere with those private creches whose fees are\r\n\r\nhigh   but   they   are  able  to  provide   better\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the need for\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of more creches to be run by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  arisen because not all  industries\r\n\r\ncan  afford to run creches of their own. I  welcome\r\n\r\nthis  Bill because the intention is to set up  more\r\n\r\ncreches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the complaints that are normally raised are\r\n\r\nthat  the creches close at a time when the  mothers\r\n\r\nare  still  at  work.  Sir,  even  the  newspapers'\r\n\r\ncomplaints mention that they close at 5.00 p.m. or 5.30  p.m.\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  drawing  up the regulations  for  these\r\n\r\ncreches  is  for the Ministry of Social Affairs  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the possibility of extending their  hours\r\n\r\nor  of  specifying various periods of  service,  so\r\n\r\nthat  working mothers who leave their  children  in\r\n\r\nthe creche early may come to collect their children\r\n\r\nearly.  And those mothers who work in the afternoon\r\n\r\ncan  similarly  call in the afternoon  and  collect\r\n\r\ntheir  children  late  in  the  evening.  If   such\r\n\r\narrangements can be made, it will certainly help  a\r\n\r\nlot  of working mothers. After all, the policy  now\r\n\r\nis to encourage our women to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\nquestion  is one of clarification.

I can say that we have 11 creches now.  This\r\n\r\nyear we are planning to build two more creches, one\r\n\r\nat  Toa  Payoh and the other at Kallang  Basin.  In\r\n\r\nother  areas,  for instance, Jurong  Town,  Katong,\r\n\r\nQueens-town, Woodlands, if there is a need, we will\r\n\r\nof course set up more creches. So if the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has any need for more creches, he can put\r\n\r\nin his proposal to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned about certain\r\n\r\nprivate  creches charging, expensive fees.  We  can\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  are not exercising any control  over\r\n\r\nthese  high  charges, because it  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nsupply and demand. So if parents want to send their\r\n\r\nchildren to such creches, it is their own business.\r\n\r\nIf  the  charges of these private creches  are  too\r\n\r\nhigh,  while  the Government's creches  charge  too\r\n\r\ncheaply, perhaps these private creches will have to\r\n\r\nclose down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has said that the\r\n\r\nopening  hours of the creches are rather short,  so\r\n\r\nthat  certain mothers find it inconvenient  because\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go  back  to fetch their  children  the\r\n\r\ncreches  are already closed. Perhaps we can suggest\r\n\r\na 24-hour service in which the staff work in shifts\r\n\r\nso  that  working mothers can fetch their  children\r\n\r\nfrom these creches at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng asked whether the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"creche\" includes kindergartens. This\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of age.

This\r\n\r\nspeech appears in the Hansard, Volume 30, cols.  461-7.\r\n\r\nI  do not need to repeat at any great  length\r\n\r\nwhat  was said at that time for neither the reasons\r\n\r\nfor,   nor   the   background  of,   the   proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation  have changed. The need,  however,  for\r\n\r\nsuch  legislation  being  made  operative  has,  if\r\n\r\nanything, become more pressing with the passing  of\r\n\r\ntime.  We  are  continually being made  aware  from\r\n\r\nhappenings in the market that investors need to  be\r\n\r\nprotected,  so  far as is possible  to  do  so,  by\r\n\r\nlegislative    intervention    from    unscrupulous\r\n\r\nmanipulation  and  share  rigging  on   the   Stock\r\n\r\nExchange. These are matters which stockbrokers with\r\n\r\nthe best will in the world as a body are unable  or\r\n\r\nnot  agreeable to control voluntarily. Needless  to\r\n\r\nsay, statutory provisions on these matters will not\r\n\r\nprovide the universal panacea. The Government  will\r\n\r\nstill  look  to  the  Stock Exchange  for  its  co-operation  in  exposing dishonesty and malpractices\r\n\r\nin  share  trading. In this and in  other  ways  we\r\n\r\nanticipate that the Stock Exchange will justify the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in relying upon self-regulation\r\n\r\non  the  Stock  Exchange rather than  imposing  the\r\n\r\nstrict  forms  of control implicit in  a  statutory\r\n\r\nbody  similar to the Securities Exchange Commission\r\n\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier speech to which I have referred, I\r\n\r\nreminded Members that Singapore and Malaysia  enjoy\r\n\r\na  common  Stock Exchange which over the years  has\r\n\r\nexisted  to the undoubted economic benefit of  both\r\n\r\ncountries. I went on to say that Members  would  be\r\n\r\nreassured  to  learn that it was the  intention  of\r\n\r\nboth  Governments that this common  Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nshould continue in existence,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand to enable this to be done it was essential that\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia should have a uniform\r\n\r\napproach in legislation dealing with the securities\r\n\r\nindustry and share trading. To this end,\r\n\r\nconsultations have taken place between us and the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government, and I am most pleased to\r\n\r\nrecord that these consultations have come to a\r\n\r\nhappy and fruitful conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that Malaysia introduced a\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Bill into their Parliament  on\r\n\r\nthe 22nd January, 1973. This Bill has been modelled\r\n\r\non our earlier Securities Industry Act, but it also\r\n\r\ncontains important additional provisions which were\r\n\r\nagreed  to  by the two Governments and  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  incorporated  in  the  present  consolidating\r\n\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I last spoke to Members on this subject, I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to  record  that  the  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nExchange   has  implemented  new  rules  to   limit\r\n\r\nexcessive speculation. Nevertheless, careful  watch\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  be  maintained  to  ensure  that  a\r\n\r\nresurgence  of  market  euphoria  does  not   carry\r\n\r\nspeculation    beyond   reasonable    bounds.    If\r\n\r\nspeculation  becomes excessive,  or  if  for  other\r\n\r\nreasons  the market becomes or is likely to  become\r\n\r\ndisorderly or unhealthy, appropriate corrective and\r\n\r\nremedial action will be called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in bringing our earlier Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Act into operation was due to the  desire\r\n\r\nto   reach   full  agreement  with  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment on this uniform approach. As things have\r\n\r\nturned  out, the delay has been fortuitous  for  it\r\n\r\nhas  given  us  an  opportunity to propose  further\r\n\r\nmeasures  with regard to regulation of  dealers  in\r\n\r\nsecurities and share trading in the context of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  booming  share market.  These,  like  the\r\n\r\nearlier  provisions, are designed  to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of investors to the extent that  this  is\r\n\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Bill corresponds very closely with\r\n\r\nthe Bill now before Members. We decided to\r\n\r\nintroduce a consolidating measure on this subject\r\n\r\nrather than an amending Bill including the\r\n\r\nadditional provisions I have mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  it  was considered important that references\r\n\r\nto  Parts  and sections in our legislation  should,\r\n\r\nfor the convenience of the financial public and the\r\n\r\nadministrators of the legislation, correspond  with\r\n\r\nthe  same  Parts  and  sections  in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nlegislation.  The  new proposals  that  distinguish\r\n\r\nthis Bill from the earlier Act are mainly concerned-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) with the keeping of records by dealers,\r\n\r\ninvestment  advisers and their representatives  and\r\n\r\nemployees of stockbrokers and financial journalists\r\n\r\nto show their interest in securities (Part V);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) with the conduct of securities business (Part VI);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) with the expansion of the provisions dealing\r\n\r\nwith  unlawful or dishonest forms of share  trading (Part X).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement describes in sufficient\r\n\r\ndetail  what this Bill seeks to achieve and I  need\r\n\r\nnot   deal  with  the  provisions  in  any  detail.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think it would be useful if I  repeated\r\n\r\nwhat  was said on the Second Reading of the earlier\r\n\r\nlegislation with regard to the objects and scope of\r\n\r\nthis proposed legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill covers the whole of the securities\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore, I would like to  reiterate\r\n\r\nthat   the   Bill  does  not  attempt  to   prevent\r\n\r\nspeculation as such. Some speculation attends every\r\n\r\nanticipation or expectation of short or  long  term\r\n\r\nprice trends which induces trading activity on  the\r\n\r\nExchange.   It  is  and  always  must  remain   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the individual investor to decide\r\n\r\nas   to   the   advisability  of   any   particular\r\n\r\ninvestment.  What  the Bill  actually  does  is  to\r\n\r\nattempt to see that the stock market operates in  a\r\n\r\nfair and open way and that people do not manipulate\r\n\r\nthe  market by illegal means for their own  profit.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill,  together with the new rules  that  have\r\n\r\nrecently  been  passed  by  members  of  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange, will, it is considered, go a long way  to\r\n\r\nachieve these objectives. However, I would like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  again that the Bill does not merely  pay\r\n\r\nlip-service to, but acknowledges, the principle  of\r\n\r\nself-regulation  of the Exchange by  the  Committee\r\n\r\nand is not intended to interfere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the day-to-day control by the Committee\r\n\r\nof  normal share trading on the Exchange, nor  with\r\n\r\nthe traditional form, of control that the Committee\r\n\r\nexercises  over members of the Exchange  except  on\r\n\r\nsuch  matters  as  the  licensing  of  dealers   in\r\n\r\nsecurities,  the  reduction to  statutory  form  of\r\n\r\nexisting  Stock Exchange Rules with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  brokers'  trust  funds   and   the\r\n\r\nfidelity fund, together with the keeping of records\r\n\r\nand  the conduct of securities business to which  I\r\n\r\nhave referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, for the first time in Singapore,\r\n\r\nproposes to license dealers in securities and their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and investment advisers  and  their\r\n\r\nemployees who are engaged in negotiating investment\r\n\r\nin  securities.  The  Government  believes  that  a\r\n\r\nsystem  of  control  by  licensing  of  dealers  in\r\n\r\nsecurities  is necessary at this time and  this  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so as regards dealers  in  securities\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  stockbrokers. For while stockbrokers\r\n\r\nhave  always  been  subject to certain  traditional\r\n\r\nforms  of  control  by  the stock  exchange,  other\r\n\r\ndealers  have not been subject to any real form  of\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The provisions in the Bill should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  only persons of good character and reputation\r\n\r\nand in a sound financial position will be permitted\r\n\r\nto  be licensed as dealers in securities under  the\r\n\r\nAct.  Licensed  dealers will be  required  to  keep\r\n\r\ntrust accounts and have them audited. This will not\r\n\r\nprove  too  burdensome to stockbrokers,  for  under\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange  Rules they have been  required  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  trust  accounts. Again, licensed  dealers\r\n\r\nwho  are not stockbrokers will be required to enter\r\n\r\ninto  a fidelity bond. The reason for this is  that\r\n\r\nthe fidelity fund provisions in the Bill apply only\r\n\r\nto  stockbrokers  who  are  members  of  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange. With regard to the latter, they will find\r\n\r\nlittle that is unusual about those provisions,  for\r\n\r\nunder  the existing Stock Exchange Rules a Fidelity\r\n\r\nGuarantee  Fund  was created to compensate  persons\r\n\r\nwho  suffer  loss  by  reason  of  the  default  of\r\n\r\nmembers.  The  provisions  in  the  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nmerely give statutory force to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishment of such a fund. The amount of capital\r\n\r\nin  the  existing fund will form the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nfund established under this Bill. The existing fund\r\n\r\nwill  be merged with the new fund established under\r\n\r\nthis Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant feature of the Bill is to be\r\n\r\nfound in Part IX where new offences are created  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  market dealings.  The  first  offence\r\n\r\nrelates  to  false trading and markets; the  second\r\n\r\noffence  to  market rigging activities;  the  third\r\n\r\noffence  to  inducing  the  sale  or  purchase   of\r\n\r\nsecurities   by   the   dissemination   of    false\r\n\r\ninformation; the fourth offence which is drafted in\r\n\r\nthe  widest possible terms to deal with inter  alia\r\n\r\ninsider  trading  by officers of a  company,  their\r\n\r\nlegal  and financial advisers and even by any other\r\n\r\nperson  who  may acquire confidential  information.\r\n\r\nThis  provision  together with  the  more  specific\r\n\r\nprovision  in  section 132A of  the  Companies  Act\r\n\r\nshould  provide  an adequate framework  to  proceed\r\n\r\nagainst  insiders.  The latter  offence,  like  the\r\n\r\nother  offences,  carries  a  maximum  penalty   of\r\n\r\n$30,000 or five years' imprisonment or to both.  It\r\n\r\nmay  not often be necessary for prosecutions to  be\r\n\r\nlaunched  under these sections, as  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates similar provisions have been used with great\r\n\r\neffect to inhibit those wrongful practices which do\r\n\r\nso much to destroy a true market in securities. The\r\n\r\nGovernment believes, and I must repeat, that it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that Parliament should clearly state  its\r\n\r\nabhorrence of such practices, which already  appear\r\n\r\nto  have become widespread in the market, and  that\r\n\r\nevery  effort should be and will be made  to  stamp\r\n\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of insider trading, I should also\r\n\r\nadd  that  in a new Companies (Amendment) Bill  the\r\n\r\nexisting  section  l32A  dealing  with  trading  by\r\n\r\nofficers of a company in their company shares  will\r\n\r\nbe considerably expanded and tightened up. Not only\r\n\r\nwill  power he sought to enable the Stock  Exchange\r\n\r\nto  conduct  a full enquiry into these matters  but\r\n\r\nalso  regulations will be made designed to restrict\r\n\r\nthe dealings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   officers  of  companies,  members   of   their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  their legal and financial  advisers,  in\r\n\r\nthe   shares  of  their  companies  during  certain\r\n\r\nperiods  of the financial year of the company  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  or  are  likely to be in  possession  of\r\n\r\nconfidential   information  likely,  if   generally\r\n\r\nknown,  to  affect  the prices of  their  company's\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the recently established Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry Council will, amongst its other functions,\r\n\r\nbe  operating as a watchdog in market trading  and,\r\n\r\nwith  the  active co-operation oc the Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe  Stock  Exchange, it is anticipated that  steps\r\n\r\nwill  be taken to punish and publicly expose  those\r\n\r\npersons who indulge in insider trading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government's views on insider\r\n\r\ntrading  and  other  dishonest  and  unfair   share\r\n\r\ntrading   practices  coincide  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's views, and provisions on most, if  not\r\n\r\nall,  of  these  matters appear  in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nSecurities Industry Bill in much the same  form  as\r\n\r\nin the Bill now before Members. It is expected that\r\n\r\nfurther  meetings  with  representatives   of   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government will shortly  take  place  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss matters of common interest relating to  the\r\n\r\nwhole  field of the securities industry and,  inter\r\n\r\nalia,  to  decide what further measures  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken to ensure that the stock market is maintained\r\n\r\nin a fair and healthy state. In this connection,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to draw the attention of Members to  the\r\n\r\nwide  powers conferred upon the Minister, in clause\r\n\r\n95 of the Bill, to regulate the stock market. Some,\r\n\r\nif  not  all, of these regulatory powers appear  in\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I make my\r\n\r\nobservation  on  the Securities  Industry  Bill,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  make  a  proposal  concerning  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of investment advisers and  stock  and\r\n\r\nshare journalists to declare their interests before\r\n\r\nthey can comment on the stock and share market. My\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposal is that all Members in this House who wish\r\n\r\nto  make  a  speech today against this Bill  should\r\n\r\nalso  declare  their interests, otherwise  it  will\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to suspicion. In this way we  would  be\r\n\r\nfair  to the investment advisers and so on.  In  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  I am concerned, I speak in support of  the\r\n\r\nBill. So whether or not I have got any shares is  a\r\n\r\nmatter inapplicable to my proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that whatever legislation is\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Government, it is always done  in\r\n\r\nthe best interests of the people. That is the first\r\n\r\nconsideration. Any proposed legislation that is  at\r\n\r\nvariance  with  the basic interests of  the  people\r\n\r\nwill  never  get  the support of the  people.  This\r\n\r\nmeans  that it will be difficult for us to  achieve\r\n\r\nour  desired  objective. The introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Bill will, I believe,  benefit\r\n\r\nthe  people in general, and the investors in stocks\r\n\r\nand shares in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is timely. As we all\r\n\r\nknow, the present boom in our economy has attracted\r\n\r\nincreasing  foreign interest in the  local  market.\r\n\r\nCoupled  with  the success of industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nrecent years, this has attracted the massive inflow\r\n\r\nof foreign capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic is regarded by foreign industrialists\r\n\r\nand investors as an ideal place for investment.  It\r\n\r\nis  against this background that our Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nhas  become  so  active and the market  heated  up.\r\n\r\nCurrent developments, however, have given rise to a\r\n\r\nmisconception among some people that they can  reap\r\n\r\nhandsome  profits just by dumping their money  into\r\n\r\nthe  share market; just like a gold mine. Actually,\r\n\r\nan  active and heated share market is not in itself\r\n\r\nan  undesirable  phenomenon, but  the  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  this sort of frenzy has been the  work  of\r\n\r\nspeculators and manipulators and not the result  of\r\n\r\nnormal development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of getting easy money in this way,\r\n\r\ninstead  of through normal hard work, has attracted\r\n\r\nmany   people  to  try  their  luck  at  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.  If the situation is allowed to continue,\r\n\r\nunchecked, it will not only weaken the will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  spirit of our people to work hard but it  will\r\n\r\nalso  impede our industrial development. Take  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  for  example.  There, the  share  market  is\r\n\r\nprobably more active and more heated than  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Professional people, and even  domestic\r\n\r\nservants,  have seen fit to abandon  their  regular\r\n\r\njobs  and  take to share speculation. As a  result,\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  industrialists have  expressed  concern\r\n\r\nover the industrial future of the colony. This  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  a good lesson for us. In order to protect\r\n\r\nour  people's interests and to encourthem  to  make\r\n\r\nbona  fide  investments, the introduction  of  this\r\n\r\nBill is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to implement this piece of legislation in\r\n\r\naccordance  with its true spirit, the  co-operation\r\n\r\nand  assistance of the responsible officials of the\r\n\r\nStock   Exchange  and  the  sharebrokers  will   be\r\n\r\nnecessary. They will play an important part in this\r\n\r\nrespect. If these people were to go their own  ways\r\n\r\nwithout  regard for the true spirit  of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthey  will  do  no good to themselves  and  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  in general. On the other hand, if they  are\r\n\r\nwilling  and  ready  to co-operate  and  assist  in\r\n\r\nensuring   the   smooth   implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, they will do a good service\r\n\r\nto  the  national economy and the interests of  the\r\n\r\npeople, including themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a global city and a prosperous society,\r\n\r\nSingapore   cannot  go  without  an  active   Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  in operation. The Stock Exchange provides\r\n\r\nthe   vital  link  in  a  prosperous  and  economic\r\n\r\nsociety.   An   economically  prosperous   country,\r\n\r\nwithout  a share market in operation, will be  just\r\n\r\nlike  a  modern  city without electrical  currents.\r\n\r\nTherefore, while the activities of the share market\r\n\r\nshould  be strictly regulated, I believe it can  be\r\n\r\nmade even more active and booming through sound and\r\n\r\nproper  administration, so that the people will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  enjoy  a  more  wholesome  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\ninvestment in stock and shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  before the House is generally considered\r\n\r\nto be an enlightened piece of legislation on a very\r\n\r\ncomplicated subject. The Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to be congratulated for this. However, for  the\r\n\r\nBill to take effect on implementation, it seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  it will be necessary for the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nprovide a staff with sufficient knowledge of market\r\n\r\noperations to assist the Minister and the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Companies  in  fulfilling  their  functions.  I\r\n\r\nshould  appreciate it if the Minister would  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  as  to what administrative arrangements\r\n\r\nare being made or will be made in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market trends in recent months have very\r\n\r\nclearly shown that there is perhaps too much  money\r\n\r\nchasing  too  few stocks. In view  of  this,  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering  what steps are being taken to  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  companies  to  go  public,  and  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  would  consider  directing  some  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-backed or Government-owned companies  to\r\n\r\ngo  public.  In  this connection  I  have  in  mind\r\n\r\ncompanies  such  as  Singapore Airlines,  Sembawang\r\n\r\nShipyard,  and  Jurong  Shipyard.  All  these   are\r\n\r\ncapital  intensive  undertakings,  with  tremendous\r\n\r\ngroup  potential. At the present juncture of  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   I  should  have  thought   that   an\r\n\r\ninjection  of  fresh capital from the  public  will\r\n\r\nhelp in their expansion programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nfact  that there is really nothing but support from\r\n\r\nthe House, I do not think there is very much for me\r\n\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the enquiry of the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu.  He  asked  whether  there  were   any\r\n\r\narrangements  made for an effective  implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill. I hasten to assure him that we  will\r\n\r\nmake  all the necessary arrangements to ensure that\r\n\r\nstaff  will  be  adequate to  deal  with  the  very\r\n\r\nessential problems of administration. I believe the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Companies will  be  moving  into  new\r\n\r\npremises  in the newly erected building behind  the\r\n\r\nCity  Hall, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  also have in that same building some of their\r\n\r\noffices dealing especially with companies. I  think\r\n\r\nthe combination should be sufficient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto allay any doubts or anxieties about our\r\n\r\nbeing serious in implementing the present\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of more companies going public,\r\n\r\nI believe I have expressed my views on this matter,\r\n\r\nin  asking  as  many companies as  possible  to  go\r\n\r\npublic.  As  far as Government-owned companies  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I  think  a  number  of  them  will  be\r\n\r\nexamining  the position after the end of the  year.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in order to enable the companies to\r\n\r\nbe  floated to prepare the accounts so that  public\r\n\r\nissue prospectuses can be prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Bras Basah requires\r\n\r\nany  answer, but I am glad to note that he  is  for\r\n\r\nthe Bill and it does not matter whether he owns any\r\n\r\nshares  or  not.  I agree with him that  an  active\r\n\r\nStock   Exchange   is   very  necessary   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In addition to the proposed New\r\n\r\nClause  which  appears in the  supplementary  Order\r\n\r\nPaper  Supplement, copies of further amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill have been handed out to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the amendments may be moved subject to the\r\n\r\nconsent  of the Speaker and the general  assent  of\r\n\r\nMembers, for notice to be dispensed with.

In  order to do this, it is  considered\r\n\r\nthat  the Registrar should have the power  to  look\r\n\r\ninto any transaction involving the purchase or sale\r\n\r\nof  securities  entered into by that person  during\r\n\r\nany  period  of 12 months preceding the application\r\n\r\nfor  a  licence or renewal of a licence.

But the way a person  has  recently\r\n\r\ncarried   on   his  business  must   be   a   vital\r\n\r\nconsideration in deciding whether he is a  fit  and\r\n\r\nproper person to be allowed to continue to carry on\r\n\r\nhis   business.  And  naturally,  there  are  other\r\n\r\nconsiderations; for example, if a person has had  a\r\n\r\nconviction  for  a criminal offence,  or  has  been\r\n\r\ndeclared a bankrupt, he would not on the face of it\r\n\r\nbe considered to he a fit and proper person to hold\r\n\r\na  licence under the Act.
