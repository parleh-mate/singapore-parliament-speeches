However, I believe\r\n\r\nthat education does not and should not begin at primary one.&nbsp; Experts in\r\n\r\nchild development believe that the most crucial period for development in\r\n\r\nlearning is the first six years of a child's life.&nbsp; Neurologists tell us\r\n\r\nthat the network of neurons or brain cells that make up the human brain\r\n\r\ndevelops and grows at a staggering rate during this early period of a child's\r\n\r\nlife.&nbsp; The more stimulation and quality input a young child receives, the\r\n\r\nmore complex and dense this network of brain cells becomes.&nbsp; When you\r\n\r\nthink about how this network forms the hardware of human intelligence, it would\r\n\r\nmake sense for us to focus much more attention on building up the capacity of\r\n\r\neach child's CPU at a time when such input has most impact.&nbsp; Some experts\r\n\r\nsay that the bulk of this growth is substantially complete by the time a child\r\n\r\nis six years old.&nbsp; So, it is during this zero-to-six-year period that\r\n\r\nchildren develop most of their neuro pathways.&nbsp; It is during this period\r\n\r\nthat the child is most eager to learn and the most open to stimulation.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt is during this period that children develop the ability to take part in\r\n\r\ntheir own learning.&nbsp; If a child receives good quality education in\r\n\r\npre-school and is given the correct environment to develop, his or her path in\r\n\r\nprimary, secondary and tertiary education could be so much more fruitful and\r\n\r\nenriching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I believe that we should encourage more of\r\n\r\nsuch participation but, in doing so, I feel that we must change our mindset and\r\n\r\nbecome more flexible in our approach to the views expressed.&nbsp; I am not\r\n\r\nadvocating that we take a flexible approach to all our rules and\r\n\r\npolicies.&nbsp; But there are some instances where flexibility can have a\r\n\r\npositive result.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 303</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The organiser\r\n\r\napproached me just before the start of the race and expressed his\r\n\r\ndisappointment at not being able to use the national flag to flag off the race\r\n\r\nor even display the national flag in the backdrop.&nbsp; Here was a chance for\r\n\r\nour little dot to shine in the eyes of the world but we missed that\r\n\r\nopportunity.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, rules and policies are obviously important.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHowever, we must realise two things: first, in the application of some rules\r\n\r\nand policies, we should learn to be more nimble and flexible; and secondly, in\r\n\r\nsome instances we must be alert enough to realise that certain rules and\r\n\r\npolicies may be outdated and not be afraid to change those rules and policies\r\n\r\nswiftly to keep up with the times.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Singapore has always been and is always going to be at\r\n\r\nthe crossroads, be it at the crossroads of Asia, changes and evolution, and now\r\n\r\nwith globalisation. As Singapore is part of a regional and global landscape,\r\n\r\nevents and developments in the region and in the world will have an impact on\r\n\r\nus. The inflow of foreign capi<p align=left>Column: 304</p>tal, technology, foreign talents, music, and\r\n\r\npopular culture has all got resonance with globalisation. We have no choice but\r\n\r\nto adapt and evolve. It is a volatile world out there. Certainly, every system\r\n\r\nmust evolve and must stay relevant with the times.&nbsp; Because only in\r\n\r\ngrowth, reform and change, paradoxically, is there security to be found.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our National Day parade slogan this year, &quot;Our\r\n\r\nGlobal city, Our Home&quot;, and the Singapore 2006 theme, \"Global City, World\r\n\r\nof Opportunities\" reflect this broad outlook that we have. In fact, in 1966 our\r\n\r\nMinister Mentor had stated: \"Societies like ours can have no fat to spare. They\r\n\r\nare either lean and healthy or they die.\"&nbsp; Indeed, he was a visionary,\r\n\r\nthinking ahead of his times.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have many of the universal requirements to\r\n\r\nbecome a global city: the amenities, the human capital, the infrastructure and\r\n\r\nnetwork as well as linkages in businesses, human interaction and\r\n\r\ncommunications. Globalisation will bring about changes and greater competition.\r\n\r\nWe cannot resist these. But we have to also partake in glocalisation, ie, local\r\n\r\nresponsiveness in a global framework where we incorporate global processes into\r\n\r\nour local settings and make global products suited to local needs and taste. As\r\n\r\nwe globalise, we must strike a balance to preserve our culture, values and also\r\n\r\nour tradition.<br>\r\n\r\nA global city will be part of and be connected to the larger global community.\r\n\r\nThis must bring about a sense of shared identity, ownership and stewardship for\r\n\r\nthe planet. The world is becoming very small and our people will cross borders\r\n\r\nas if they are crossing roads of yesteryears.&nbsp; Are we preparing them for\r\n\r\nthese crossings?<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n<i>Education<br>\r\n\r\n</i>&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we adapt to the changes, education is the common\r\n\r\ndenominator in helping society to level up. The education <p align=left>Column: 305</p>system will have to\r\n\r\nevolve and adapt to prepare our students to become global citizens. The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has been doing this gradually through implementation of\r\n\r\npolicies and also curriculum change. Singapore\u2019s model for success has an impressive\r\n\r\nemphasis on education.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any curriculum, there is always the formal, the\r\n\r\ninformal as well as the hidden curriculum. The formal curriculum is one that is\r\n\r\nwritten and found on paper and is the one which students and teachers rush to\r\n\r\ncover before the examinations. The informal curriculum is one where there is\r\n\r\nindirect learning. But, importantly, there is the hidden curriculum, which has\r\n\r\nproven to be very powerful and&nbsp;represents all the nuances, behaviour and\r\n\r\nthe non-verbal cues, etc. that are projected from teachers to students, based\r\n\r\non the interpretation and perception of the latter. It is thus very important\r\n\r\nto make teachers realise the power they have to change and influence. The\r\n\r\nprimary school teacher especially is an important and influential&nbsp; adult\r\n\r\nto the school-going child. This teacher will make the crucial difference to the\r\n\r\nchild\u2019s academic, social, emotional and psychological growth and development.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to have an understanding of pedagogy, which\r\n\r\nis the art and science of learning and teaching. They are the role models on\r\n\r\nimpressionable youths and their&nbsp; words and action can leave an indelible\r\n\r\nimpression&nbsp; on these young minds. Teachers are like \u2018step-in parents\u2019 for\r\n\r\ntheir contact time with the children at school. Besides transmission of\r\n\r\nknowledge, pupils will acquire values of compassion, responsibility, diligence,\r\n\r\nlove, courtesy and determination.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I applaud the recent move by the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto have more dedicated time and funding for teachers in terms of training,\r\n\r\neducation and upgrade <p align=left>Column: 306</p>in line with the GROW programme. For some, the suggested\r\n\r\nsabbatical sessions which they will have, it is also going to serve as a period\r\n\r\nof reflection on their teaching. Programmes such as the leaders in educational\r\n\r\nprogramme (LEP) and Leader for Leaders\u2019 programme (LLP) will certainly have a\r\n\r\nsignificant bearing on teachers' learning, self reflection, innovation and\r\n\r\nsharing. Therefore, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education to support\r\n\r\nas many teachers as possible who qualify to be enrolled in these programmes for\r\n\r\nself enhancement and development.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ability and value based education can help to bring\r\n\r\nabout students who are not only academically inclined, but also innovative,\r\n\r\ncreative and worldly in their outlook and mindset. This is in line with our\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's call to build talent which is like a whole range of mountains\r\n\r\nand not just single peaks.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I would also like to strongly suggest\r\n\r\nthe introduction of a series of non-examinable subjects which could include\r\n\r\nsimple economics, Singapore politics, history, logic, ethics, and maybe simple\r\n\r\nfinancial management for students.&nbsp; This must be done hand in hand with a\r\n\r\nreview and reduction of some of the hard-core curriculum that we have in schools.\r\n\r\nSince these are non-examinable subjects, the students would have no stress of\r\n\r\nstudying them to pass examinations and they can enjoy these subjects better and\r\n\r\ncertainly will contribute towards their adulthood as well.&nbsp; The topics\r\n\r\ncovered will have to be practical, interesting and engaging; building and\r\n\r\ninculcating nationalistic spirit and altruism, conducted in a participatory and\r\n\r\ninteractive fashion. Exposure at this tender age will help create understanding\r\n\r\nand strengthen the sense of identity and belonging to Singapore.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can also be a step in the direction towards\r\n\r\nmaking our students socially, economically and politically more aware <p align=left>Column: 307</p>and\r\n\r\nconscious, countering the many claims made recently that our youth and young\r\n\r\npeople have no interest and are very low in their awareness of issues like\r\n\r\nthese. Only when one takes ownership and pride in one\u2019s community and country\r\n\r\nwill one strive to make it better.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n<i>Volunteerism: The young, the elderly and the community support</i><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What better way to inculcate this than through\r\n\r\nvolunteerism and community involvement. The only way to understand the\r\n\r\ncontribution of time, effort and energy of volunteers, is by immersing oneself\r\n\r\nin these very similar activities. The involvement can help evolve youths as\r\n\r\nwell as young adults to have a wider perspective, a more global view. It can\r\n\r\nhelp shape personalities and character as well as make them more tolerant. As\r\n\r\nit is, the post-65 generation has always been blamed for not understanding our\r\n\r\nroots and the hardships faced by our parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Through\r\n\r\nvolunteerism, we can feel poverty, sadness, misery, desperation, fear and\r\n\r\nhunger.&nbsp; I can personally vouch for this for having done volunteer work\r\n\r\nand community service for over 20 years, including humanitarian activities\r\n\r\noverseas in countries such as&nbsp; Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,\r\n\r\nCambodia, China, Indonesia, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to learn how\r\n\r\nto empathise. We have to learn that helping others is a blessing. And we learn\r\n\r\nto also take nothing for granted, including our livelihood and security as\r\n\r\nwell.&nbsp; We can build up our \u2018heartware\".&nbsp; As we serve, it will help\r\n\r\ntrigger emotions on seeing, learning and feeling the unspoken hopes of many who\r\n\r\nare disabled, disadvantaged and in need.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can volunteerism benefit Singapore?<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteers are usually active citizens who have a role\r\n\r\nin Singapore\u2019s future. They want to be kept informed of all developments.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey will offer ideas which <p align=left>Column: 308</p>are productive, and their experiences and\r\n\r\nthoughtful consideration have gone into these. Volunteers will help implement\r\n\r\nwhat they envision and make that positive impact on society. They will\r\n\r\ncontribute towards the task of nation building.<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, for serving humanity is indeed the\r\n\r\nbest work of life and it dishes out the best lessons for man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Volunteerism will galvanise our multiracial\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding.

I spoke to the Town Council guy and he said that\r\n\r\nthat lady had been calling&nbsp;them every single day to complain of the same\r\n\r\nissue.&nbsp; Certainly, they, who were the experts, could not find the root\r\n\r\ncause.&nbsp; I did not take very long to realise that she actually was\r\n\r\ndepressed&nbsp;and was hallucinating.

In his\r\n\r\nAddendum to the Presidential Address, our Health Minister has\r\n\r\nalready&nbsp;mentioned about upgrading the mental health programme \"to make\r\n\r\nSingapore an emotionally resilient society\". Certainly, this is in line\r\n\r\nwith&nbsp;the Ministry of Health's&nbsp;eight health priorities for the future,\r\n\r\nnamely, (1)&nbsp;to build a healthy population; and (2)&nbsp;to manage diseases\r\n\r\nholistically and not episodically.&nbsp; Let me put some perspective on this. From\r\n\r\nthe IMH and the Health Promotion Board's&nbsp;survey of 2004, the prevalence of\r\n\r\ndepression&nbsp;and anxiety related disorders was 16% in our community, and the\r\n\r\nnumber is increasing everyday. However,&nbsp;only 48% of these people have\r\n\r\nsought treatment.&nbsp;The World <p align=left>Column: 311</p>Health Organisation has estimated that 15% of\r\n\r\nall premature deaths in Singapore as well as disability is related to\r\n\r\npsychological illnesses. This is an alarming number because these are people\r\n\r\nwho are dying well before their time.&nbsp;Another Ministry of Health's survey\r\n\r\nshowed that the number of children less than 18 years visiting psychiatrist at\r\n\r\nGovernment run outpatient clinics was 1,120 in 1990, and it had gone up to\r\n\r\n2,499 in the year 2000, and 50% of them are of primary school age, an alarming\r\n\r\nnumber indeed. Certainly, we need to do something about this because if we do\r\n\r\nnot, the numbers will be increasing.&nbsp;And will the pressure make them prone\r\n\r\nto depression as adults?&nbsp; The long-term consequences will depend on their\r\n\r\npsychological resilience as well as the community support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychological\r\n\r\nillnesses have been stereotyped and stigmatised. The theory that the patients\r\n\r\nare \u2018dangerously mad\u2019 must be debunked. Our mental health understanding and\r\n\r\nalso mental literacy has to be increased. That is why I am very heartened that\r\n\r\nthe Institute of Mental Health has increased its research funding from $700,000\r\n\r\nto $1.4 million this year, and this will certainly contribute\r\n\r\ntowards&nbsp;studies and trials to help many of our patients with psychological\r\n\r\nillnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In Malay</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>For\r\n\r\nvernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a\r\n\r\nhref=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061109/20061109VS_150911.pdf\">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, please give me the opportunity to speak in Malay on issues\r\n\r\nfaced by the Malay-Muslim community. The Malay-Muslim community has come a long\r\n\r\nway as compared to&nbsp;10 years ago. Many improvements have taken place. Our\r\n\r\nleaders, institutions, organisations and mosques have been very proactive and\r\n\r\nhave shown an open mindset which is progressive and constructive, whereas in\r\n\r\nyesteryears, the community may highlight their unhappiness with the Mandarin\r\n\r\nrequirement with certain companies. But now with the change in mindset, I am\r\n\r\nseeing at dialogues, Malay parents <p align=left>Column: 312</p>standing up to ask for compulsory\r\n\r\nconversational Mandarin classes in schools for their children so they will not\r\n\r\nbe left out. Well done to these parents for having that mindset. However, just\r\n\r\nas we have been the hardest hit by the economic crisis, the Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity will also face great changes with globalisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workforce will\r\n\r\nbe more competitive especially for the lower income and older workers. My\r\n\r\nadvice to them would be to strengthen their spirit and take up courses to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills and capabilities so that they will not be left behind. The\r\n\r\nGovernment and grassroot organisations will help them as much as they possibly\r\n\r\ncould in providing them with the opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fast disappearing borders in the face of\r\n\r\nglobalisation and the digital age, our youths will require support and attention\r\n\r\nto bring them away from the unhealthy impact of this influence. Within the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim community, we are still seeing significant problems such as\r\n\r\npre-marital sex, single mothers who have many children, teenage abortions,\r\n\r\ndivorces and drug addiction. Traditional and moral values are beginning to be\r\n\r\neroded by globalisation.&nbsp; Our usage of Malay Language is also getting\r\n\r\nlesser.&nbsp; There is a Malay saying which says that tradition is so important\r\n\r\nthat they would sacrifice their child as long as the tradition is protected.\r\n\r\nThis shows that tradition is very important for the Malay-Muslim community in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, every member of the community must uphold these good and\r\n\r\nprogressive values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Muslim community has progressed towards\r\n\r\nexcellence. The document \"Building an excellent Muslim community in Singapore\"\r\n\r\nwhich was issued by MUIS this year is a good effort and should be a source of\r\n\r\nreference for all of us.&nbsp; It explains Islam as a religion that promotes\r\n\r\neducation, peace and also progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 313</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madrasahs have carried out many changes.

Madrasahs are in the process of making changes and refinements to\r\n\r\ntheir curriculum so that by 2008, their primary schools would be ready for PSLE\r\n\r\nto be integrated into their CE programme. This will enable the madrasah\r\n\r\nstudents to be well versed and competent in Mathematics, Science and English\r\n\r\nLanguage.&nbsp; Madrasah Al Maarif, for example,&nbsp; is planning on starting\r\n\r\na full day school and will have new value-added subjects.

The approach taken\r\n\r\nby the Government has been two-fold.&nbsp; On the one hand, we endeavour to\r\n\r\ncreate as many job opportunities as possible by revving up growth in the\r\n\r\neconomy.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Government provides the best possible\r\n\r\neducation and skills development to equip Singaporeans with the life skills to\r\n\r\nbe employable in the marketplace.&nbsp; Lifelong learning is supposed to be\r\n\r\npart and parcel of our life, but we expect lesser spontaneity in those who are\r\n\r\nless educated.&nbsp; The Government established the Workforce Development\r\n\r\nAgency (WDA) in 2003 to champion re-training, <p align=left>Column: 316</p>re-skilling and job re-creation.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) Framework is also a\r\n\r\nwell-structured system. &nbsp;But I hope Singaporeans are aware of and\r\n\r\nunderstand the schemes well enough to take advantage of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive programmes offered by WDA as well as NTUC, we need to tackle the\r\n\r\nchallenge of employability in a more holistic way.&nbsp; Here are a few more\r\n\r\nareas we could look at.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, personal\r\n\r\ncounselling and coaching sessions will be beneficial to Singaporeans who are at\r\n\r\nrisk. Often, individuals, particularly the less educated, may not be in tune\r\n\r\nwith the structural changes to the marketplace and the options available.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey need advice and guidance on how to re-position themselves in the\r\n\r\nworkforce. &nbsp;They also need help to develop self-confidence, the motivation\r\n\r\nand communication techniques to market themselves.&nbsp; I suggest that the WDA\r\n\r\nand CDCs consider establishing well-staffed regional employment centres that\r\n\r\nnot only help in the job search but also provide personal counselling sessions\r\n\r\non employability, skill training and employment options.&nbsp; Following WDA's\r\n\r\nannouncement earlier this week to give workers more ownership and control over\r\n\r\ntraining, such services are even more necessary to guide the workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMore qualified job and training counsellors are needed.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we need to\r\n\r\nnurture the culture and mindset of lifelong learning, whether in\r\n\r\nschools,&nbsp;the community or through public education campaigns.&nbsp; We may\r\n\r\nnot see immediate results, but we should work for progressive changes in our\r\n\r\nattitudes, particularly, targeting at the less educated workforce. &nbsp;I\r\n\r\nalways find Jack Neo\u2019s movie very persuasive.&nbsp; Perhaps, he or MediaCorp\r\n\r\ncan also make a comical movie to inspire Singaporeans to make learning a way of\r\n\r\nlife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 317</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On average, each\r\n\r\nSingaporean spends about 10 to 15 of their early years to acquire formal\r\n\r\neducation and then seeks to be employed for the rest of his working life, which\r\n\r\nlasts about 40 years, until the retirement age of 62. &nbsp;With the pace of\r\n\r\nchange these days, we need to challenge this basic premise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singaporeans should be encouraged to\r\n\r\nre-educate themselves with courses at our learning institutions, besides the\r\n\r\nskills-based training offered by WDA and NTUC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all agree that\r\n\r\nlifelong learning is fast becoming a necessity.&nbsp; Hence, my third point is\r\n\r\nthat the Government could consider allowing middle-aged Singaporeans to use a\r\n\r\nsmall part of their CPF savings to pay for courses or training that would\r\n\r\nimprove their employability.&nbsp; They will be in a better position to save\r\n\r\nfor a more secure retirement if their employability is enhanced.&nbsp; This is\r\n\r\nnot against the objective of CPF.&nbsp; For example, one of my grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders in the logistics business said that they are always short of Class 4\r\n\r\nand prime-mover drivers and have had to turn to Malaysians for such\r\n\r\ndrivers.&nbsp; He suggested that more Singaporeans would come forward to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills if they can use their CPF to pay for part of the cost.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;In the case of a Class 4 licence, it can amount to about a S1,000.&nbsp; To\r\n\r\nquite a number of lower-income Singaporeans, CPF is probably their only source\r\n\r\nof savings and probably the only means they can&nbsp;pay for such skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, I would\r\n\r\nlike to be convinced that we can do more.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; The\r\n\r\nGovernment is already investing more than $100,000 per child in the form of\r\n\r\nsubsidies given to take this child from primary to tertiary education.&nbsp; At\r\n\r\nthe national level, we are spending close to 4% of our GDP or about $7 billion\r\n\r\nper annum on education, to provide them with the skills and mental capacity to\r\n\r\ntake on good employment.&nbsp; But let me ask Members of the House: how long do\r\n\r\nyou think this investment would last?&nbsp; Is there an expiry date to what we\r\n\r\nlearnt yesterday for tomorrow's application?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era of\r\n\r\nrelentless innovation and pervasive communication, new knowledge is created by\r\n\r\nthe million bytes every second.&nbsp; Graduates from some disciplines, such as\r\n\r\nelectronics and IT, know very well that the half life of their university\r\n\r\nstudies may be good for only the next two years before they become\r\n\r\nobsolete.&nbsp; Yes, half of what you learn in four years in polytechnics and\r\n\r\nuniversities can become obsolete in two years, and they get halved every two\r\n\r\nyears.&nbsp; Of course, for most of our tertiary students, by the time they\r\n\r\ngraduate from the polytechnics and universities, they would have mastered the\r\n\r\nskills of continual education and learning.&nbsp; And if they are not\r\n\r\ncomplacent, they would continue to acquire new skills on the job.&nbsp; This\r\n\r\nwould ensure their employability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What should be the order or magnitude of the budget, even though\r\n\r\na good part of it can come from the employer?&nbsp; Of course, we hope that\r\n\r\nmost of our young workers gainfully employed will receive training from\r\n\r\nemployers to update their skills.&nbsp;

With the trend of structural unemployment, white collar and\r\n\r\nblue collar workers are equally at risk.&nbsp; As we have seen in our own MPS,\r\n\r\nsome who are jobless might not be able to find jobs even after more than six\r\n\r\nmonths, and the others have to take a longer time to acquire new skills before\r\n\r\nthey can change to a different job.&nbsp;

But if we look beneath the top line, we will\r\n\r\nrealise that the re-employment rate of resident retrenched workers had hovered\r\n\r\naround 60% for the past four years.&nbsp; In other words, 40% of the displaced\r\n\r\nworkers remained unemployed after six months.&nbsp; Why are they unemployed for\r\n\r\nso long?&nbsp; Are they choosy, as some employers have vehemently\r\n\r\nclaimed?&nbsp; Or do they lack the skills needed for new jobs created?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This was a good programme because it addresses most\r\n\r\npeople's needs.

This is correct because they are\r\n\r\ngrant-based and we do not want to dish out large handouts to the extent that it\r\n\r\ndestroys the motivation to work.&nbsp; But for the squeezed middle-class, I\r\n\r\nthink we should think of some non-grant loan-based programme to help them tide\r\n\r\nthrough the difficult but transitionary time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At the same time, I would also\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Government consider setting up a one-stop service centre\r\n\r\nequivalent of&nbsp;town council to look after the needs of the residents in the\r\n\r\nprivate residential estates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the cost of living in Singapore has\r\n\r\nrisen.&nbsp; Many families have to work harder to cope with the inflated cost\r\n\r\nof living, particularly those who are in the lower-<p align=left>Column: 341</p>income group and also those\r\n\r\nwho are elderly and retrenched.&nbsp; They are now earning much less income.\r\n\r\nWhen they want to return to the workforce, they have to work longer hours, very\r\n\r\noften from 9 to 12 hours a day and six days a week. Even then, there is no\r\n\r\npromise that they will earn more income. At the same time, essential expenses\r\n\r\nsuch as utilities, public transport, etc, have all gone up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote our traffic problem as an example.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I must be fair to all the public transport operators.&nbsp; They\r\n\r\nare very cooperative.&nbsp; We raised some requests to them. Generally, they\r\n\r\nwould listen to us. Of course, I hope that they would do more. I have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully petitioned for a shuttle bus service between the Teachers Estate\r\n\r\nand Yio Chu Kang MRT for the residents of the Teachers Estate.&nbsp; I would\r\n\r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the SMRT. After operating for just three\r\n\r\nmonths, SMRT told me that they were running a loss with this route and it is\r\n\r\nvery possible that this route would be discontinued.&nbsp; Teachers Estate is\r\n\r\nsituated at a valley and many of the residents are retirees. Without this\r\n\r\nshuttle bus service, these elderly residents would have to walk 500 to 600\r\n\r\nmetres and to climb some 60 steps of the stairs to reach the nearest bus stop -\r\n\r\n500 to 600 metres and on top of that, they have to go up 60 steps of the\r\n\r\nstairs. Is this the way we want to treat all these senior citizens, these\r\n\r\nretired people, who have in their prime time contributed to our social,\r\n\r\neconomic and education fields?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the\r\n\r\nTeachers Estate, I have three other residential estates in my\r\n\r\nconstituency.&nbsp; They are Springleaf Garden, Springside and Lentor\r\n\r\nAvenue.&nbsp; The residents also have a lot of complaints about the public\r\n\r\ntransport facilities there.&nbsp; I have approached LTA, SMRT and SBS with the\r\n\r\nhope that they would take into consideration the interests of their <p align=left>Column: 342</p>commuters\r\n\r\nand residents to resolve their problems as soon as possible. Should it be\r\n\r\nnecessary to make changes to the policy, they should be carried out\r\n\r\nvigorously.&nbsp; Only then can we attract more Singaporeans to switch to\r\n\r\npublic transport.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point is on the traffic operations.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFrom the financial report, comparing the half yearly results of this year to\r\n\r\nthe same period last year, we can see that ComfortDelgro's profit has gone up\r\n\r\nby 2.4% and the SMRT, in its 2006 financial year, has made a net profit of $120\r\n\r\nmillion.&nbsp; In its financial report for 2006, the group's profit has gone up\r\n\r\nby 5.7%, accounting for $711.07 million. On the second quarter ending in June\r\n\r\nthis year, ComfortDelgro reported that SBC under the group, the profit has gone\r\n\r\nup by 3.8%, accounting for $129.9 million.&nbsp; I know that companies cannot\r\n\r\noperate like charitable organisations.&nbsp; I also know that the shareholders\r\n\r\nare asking for reasonable returns. I have also read the statements by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Transport.&nbsp; It says that the capital investment of these\r\n\r\ncompanies is very high and their returns are inferior as compared to other\r\n\r\ncompanies with similar capital investment.&nbsp; However, I feel that the fare\r\n\r\nadjustment policy needs to be improved upon. While many people are having\r\n\r\nproblems coping with the rises in the utility charges, the traffic operators\r\n\r\nare raising their fares much to the distress of the low income people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the traffic operators can claim that they\r\n\r\nhave set aside some part of their funds to help the poor families. But is that\r\n\r\nenough?&nbsp; I understand that the recently introduced $20 transport\r\n\r\nassistance vouchers have all been handed out. Many residents have complained\r\n\r\nthat they have not benefited from this scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the 2006 Census, there are some 283,400\r\n\r\nfamilies with monthly income of less than $2,000. Among them, 36,000 families\r\n\r\nearn less than $1,000 and there are 106,400 families which have no income at\r\n\r\nall.&nbsp; These two <p align=left>Column: 343</p>groups of households accounted for 14.9% of the total\r\n\r\nnumber of households in Singapore. The Government has launched many schemes to\r\n\r\nhelp the people who are in financial difficulties. These include the setting up\r\n\r\nof the ComCare Fund, the distribution of the Progress Package and to provide\r\n\r\nthe training and retraining schemes for the people. The Government wants to\r\n\r\nhelp its people so that they could cope with the cost of living. While the\r\n\r\nGovernment is extending a helping hand to these people, the traffic operators and\r\n\r\nthe utility and energy operators are sticking out their invading hands to take\r\n\r\naway some of the due benefits from the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in transport,\r\n\r\nwe all know that a new gantry point has been set up at the north side of the\r\n\r\nCTE.&nbsp; The serious traffic congestion situation is still a daily\r\n\r\noccurrence.&nbsp; This means that residents in the northern part of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave to pay more money.&nbsp; Yet, they do not seem to derive any benefit from\r\n\r\nthere, although there is a theory that says that a higher road pricing will\r\n\r\nreduce the volume of traffic. The LTA has already set up six ERP gantry points\r\n\r\nat the CTE, Braddell Road, Serangoon Road, PIE link road to the CTE and also\r\n\r\nthe exit of CTE.&nbsp; There are altogether six more gantry points.&nbsp; With\r\n\r\nso many gantry points, has there been any improvement to the traffic situation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can read from the newspapers that there were lots\r\n\r\nand lots of complaints. The <i>Straits Times</i> also carried a report on this\r\n\r\nmatter on 25th September this year.&nbsp; The fact remains that my residents who\r\n\r\nare driving will have to pay higher transport expenses. If the ERP is unable to\r\n\r\nserve its designed purpose in solving the traffic congestion problem, then why\r\n\r\nare we putting up more and more gantry points along the Central Expressway -\r\n\r\ncollect money in the morning, collect money at night?&nbsp; Although our\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion situation is relatively <p align=left>Column: 344</p>better than the other countries in\r\n\r\nour region, what we asked for is for the authorities to explore other better\r\n\r\nalternatives to better manage our traffic problems and not just keep on adding\r\n\r\nmore and more unpopular gantry points.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=2 width=\"50%\" align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</span></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>*Cols. 411-416.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>4.40 pm<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong\r\n\r\nSeng (Hong Kah)</b> <i>(In Mandarin)</i>:&nbsp;[<i>For vernacular speech,\r\n\r\nplease refer to&nbsp;<a\r\n\r\nhref=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061109/20061109VS_151336.pdf\">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the motion to thank the President by MP Mdm Halimah. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Address, the President\r\n\r\npointed out that our country is facing a new turning point.&nbsp; Today, the\r\n\r\ninternational competition is getting greater and the global situation and\r\n\r\nbusiness conditions are unpredictable.&nbsp; Therefore, our Government and\r\n\r\npeople must work together to seize the opportunities to raise the productivity\r\n\r\nof our economy.

The first example. There is a man in his 50s. He was very\r\n\r\nactive in the past. Whenever we had activities organised by RC, he would\r\n\r\nparticipate in them. He was very healthy. But there was one year that I missed\r\n\r\nhim.&nbsp; And last week, when he came, he had a cap on.&nbsp; He looked pale.\r\n\r\nI asked him what had happened to him. He removed his cap and he was bald - all\r\n\r\nhis hair had dropped off. He said, he was a cancer patient. In the last few\r\n\r\nmonths, he had already spent more than $30,000 to treat his cancer. I believe\r\n\r\nthat in future, he would have to pay even more medical bills. He told me that\r\n\r\nhe had depleted his savings and cash. The only asset he has is the four-room\r\n\r\nflat. He has considered selling his four-room flat and raised money to treat\r\n\r\nhis illness. But when he went to HDB to make enquiries, the officer told <p align=left>Column: 346</p>him\r\n\r\nthat he could sell the flat but within 30 months, he could not apply for a new\r\n\r\nflat. He told him that he should try his best to rent a flat from his contacts\r\n\r\nelsewhere. The market rental is very high.&nbsp; For people with illness, it is\r\n\r\nnot easy to rent a room. So he came to me for help. I have written in to HDB,\r\n\r\nhoping that the HDB officer, while implementing the policy, will treat these\r\n\r\npeople with compassion and help Singaporeans in need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=2 width=\"50%\" align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</span></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>*Cols. 417-420.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is\r\n\r\nthat of a Malay citizen.&nbsp; He has seven children.&nbsp; His income is about\r\n\r\n$1,000 and his take-home pay is about $800.&nbsp; And because of his financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties, he was in arrears in his monthly housing instalment to HDB, conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges to the Town Council and PUB bills.&nbsp; So I have written in for an\r\n\r\ninstalment payment plan.&nbsp; But because his debt is so high, even with the\r\n\r\ninstalment plan, he could not meet the instalment payments.&nbsp; So his water\r\n\r\nand electricity supplies were cut off.&nbsp; We applied for a special\r\n\r\n&quot;pay-as-you-use&quot; meter for him.&nbsp; But after a few months,\r\n\r\nSingapore Power Services asked him to pay by instalments again.&nbsp; So,\r\n\r\nreally, he could not do much else.&nbsp; There is one bundle of these letters\r\n\r\nfrom SP Services.&nbsp; SP Services has the policy that he has to pay 20% of\r\n\r\nhis arrears from his cashcard.&nbsp; This is a good policy to help the poor to\r\n\r\ntide over their difficulties.&nbsp; But I do not understand why SP Services\r\n\r\nofficials continue to press them to pay up the arrears.&nbsp; These poor\r\n\r\ncitizens are facing real problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span\r\n\r\nstyle='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some residents tell me\r\n\r\nthat when oil prices went up, the tariffs went up.

Next, Sir, I turn to the\r\n\r\nother values which I feel could be improved upon in Singapore.&nbsp; One of\r\n\r\nthem is to be considerate to our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Christians have\r\n\r\nit in the golden rule, which is: do unto others what you have them do unto\r\n\r\nyou.&nbsp; And this is similar to Confucius saying of &quot;do not do unto\r\n\r\nothers what you&nbsp;do not want others do unto you&quot;.&nbsp; As a simple\r\n\r\nillustration, if you do not want others to block you when you are coming out\r\n\r\nfrom the MRT train exit, then do not block others when you are trying to enter\r\n\r\nthe train.&nbsp; If you want the table at the hawker centre to be clean, then\r\n\r\ndo not leave chicken bones and used tissue on the same table.&nbsp; If every\r\n\r\nSingaporean can be a bit more considerate towards their fellow Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthen life will become more pleasant and social bonds amongst your neighbours\r\n\r\nwill become stronger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another value which\r\n\r\nI feel that we can improve upon is that of being humble.&nbsp; Many people have\r\n\r\nspoken about how elitist Singaporeans have become.&nbsp; And this is especially\r\n\r\nso because of the way we segregate those students who have done well in their\r\n\r\nacademic studies from a young age.&nbsp; In short, once you are identified as\r\n\r\nbeing a gifted student, a scholar material, you are set apart from the others\r\n\r\nand put on a fast track so that you can be groomed to excel.&nbsp; Invariably,\r\n\r\nthere is this sense that these people who <p align=left>Column: 369</p>have been earmarked to become\r\n\r\nscholars are amongst the best of the best, the so-called elite.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this same system has also created a barrier amongst those who\r\n\r\nare considered the elite and those who are not.&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann called\r\n\r\nthem &quot;farmers&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus important for\r\n\r\nus to remind those Singaporeans who have done well in their lives that we must\r\n\r\nremain humble.&nbsp; It does not matter that you have become richer.&nbsp; It\r\n\r\ndoes not matter that you have become more successful or that you have reached\r\n\r\nhigh positions in your life.&nbsp; We must not be arrogant but we must remain\r\n\r\nhumble in our outlook in life.&nbsp; Recently, Prof. Lee Wei Leng wrote an\r\n\r\nopinion piece in the newspaper in which she opined that a super elitist system\r\n\r\nmay not necessarily be good for society as a whole.&nbsp; I share her\r\n\r\nsentiments.&nbsp; In fact, I would say that if our schools produce a top\r\n\r\nstudent with many &quot;As&quot; but who lacks humility and apathy for his\r\n\r\nfellow students, then the schools would have failed in their role as an\r\n\r\neducator as they have failed in building up the students.&nbsp; A student who\r\n\r\nthinks that he has obtained a scholarship because he is super intelligent and\r\n\r\ndoes not attribute his scholarship to his parents, his friends and his teachers\r\n\r\nshould not get the scholarship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like the Government to look into how we can promote the virtue of being\r\n\r\nan encourager.&nbsp; We should constantly look for ways and means to encourage\r\n\r\nthose who have done well in any part of their lives.&nbsp; A kind word, a boost\r\n\r\nto the morale, would go a long way towards making life more pleasant for\r\n\r\neveryone.&nbsp; For those who are down, we should look for ways to tell them to\r\n\r\nkeep their chins up, that it is not the end of the world, that there is light\r\n\r\nat the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; Each time I read in the newspaper about someone\r\n\r\nwho has committed suicide, I felt terribly sad and I <p align=left>Column: 370</p>asked myself -&nbsp;if\r\n\r\nonly someone had taken the time and the effort to give some comforting words to\r\n\r\nlift up the weak, some words of encouragement to that person, to be kind to\r\n\r\nthat person, to show compassion - would it have made a difference to that\r\n\r\nperson, would it have prevented the suicide?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nlack of social graces, the lack of that amount of basic character values will\r\n\r\nnot augur well for us as a nation and for us as Singaporeans.&nbsp; We should\r\n\r\nnot allow our rush to excel in our careers,&nbsp;to become richer or to become\r\n\r\nmore influential affect these values as they will affect the social\r\n\r\ncohesion.&nbsp; The Government can set the tone in its policies and we too, as\r\n\r\nMPs, as leaders of the country,&nbsp; can make it our policy that we will\r\n\r\nstrive to be kinder, more grateful, humble, considerate, and that we will be an\r\n\r\nencourager of our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp; If we can get more and more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto adopt&nbsp; and practise these values in their daily lives, I am certain\r\n\r\nthat social cohesion will be much strengthened and we would be able to make\r\n\r\nSingapore a country that Singaporeans can be proud of and Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nlove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I ponder on the\r\n\r\ncommon threads of discussion that I had from my house-to-<p align=left>Column: 371</p>house visits, dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions, meet-the-people sessions, the key theme that keeps coming back to me\r\n\r\nis what does it mean to be Singaporeans and why is Singapore home.&nbsp; This\r\n\r\nrelates to the point that President Nathan highlighted on the need to build an\r\n\r\ninclusive society and that every citizen must contribute to our shared\r\n\r\nwell-being. To this point, I would like to touch on the Singapore identity and\r\n\r\nbelonging and what I term &quot;home&quot; and &quot;hope&quot;.&nbsp; In order\r\n\r\nto have an inclusive society and one that every citizen feels committed to\r\n\r\ncontribute for the well-being of fellow Singaporeans, there really needs to be\r\n\r\na strong sense of identity and belonging where we as citizens are not just\r\n\r\nintellectually but also emotionally engaged in policies, practices and goals of\r\n\r\nthe country.&nbsp; This Singapore identity is something, I believe, which is\r\n\r\nstill elusive, and that we as a nation are grappling with.&nbsp; There seems to\r\n\r\nbe this underlying cry for hope and, if I dare say, dream.&nbsp; And what do I\r\n\r\nmean?&nbsp; It is not that residents I meet say to me, &quot;Give me\r\n\r\nhope&quot;, or &quot;Help me make Singapore home&quot;. Rather, what I have\r\n\r\nheard is, life is hard, work hours are long, it is very competitive, cost of\r\n\r\nliving is high, the list goes on.&nbsp; These grouses are not unique to\r\n\r\nSingapore.&nbsp; But why is that Singaporeans seem to complain more about\r\n\r\nthat?&nbsp; It can be attributed in part to the size of our country and the\r\n\r\nhigh dependency on the global economy.&nbsp; But I think it goes beyond.&nbsp; There\r\n\r\nis really a continuum of Singaporean view on the subject. There are those that\r\n\r\nregard Singapore as their home and see hope for a future for themselves and\r\n\r\ntheir families, and we need to get them involved and engaged and enable them to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Singapore Dream and enable them to also continue the\r\n\r\nSingapore Dream. Then there are those who want to make Singapore home and who\r\n\r\nare looking for hope but are finding it difficult to do so.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is\r\n\r\nit because of a perception gap or communication or execution of policies?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 372</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read recently in <i>The</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Economist</i> in a special report in June this year on the inequality in\r\n\r\nAmerica and core to the American dream as cited is the hope that if you work\r\n\r\nhard,&nbsp;you can succeed, regardless of the strata of society that you are\r\n\r\nin, and that you can ride the tide and the tide of growth will lift many\r\n\r\nboats.&nbsp; However, it also cited that since year 2000, this hope however\r\n\r\nseems to be dampening as the tide seems to be lifting fewer\r\n\r\nboats.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same scenario in Singapore where although we have\r\n\r\nstrong economic growth, it seems to be benefiting a small group whilst\r\n\r\nsqueezing the large numbers in the middle and widening the gap between those at\r\n\r\nthe top and the bottom.&nbsp; The point of income distribution and the widening\r\n\r\ngap is an important one.&nbsp; But I will not be discussing it today as this\r\n\r\nhas been well elaborated by my colleagues who have spoken before me.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInstead, I would like to highlight another area which I feel needs to be\r\n\r\naddressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us will\r\n\r\nagree that Singapore, as a society, has a very high degree of efficiency and,\r\n\r\nto that end, that quest for efficiency has resulted in flawless execution and\r\n\r\nimplementation.&nbsp; In some sense, people may feel that the focus on the\r\n\r\nprocess and efficiency has led to the loss of the focus on the\r\n\r\nindividuals.&nbsp; Minister Raymond Lim, in his comments in the recent review\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Land Transport policy, made an important point, and I quote:\r\n\r\n&quot;The transport system must be planned and built to benefit people movement\r\n\r\nrather than vehicle movement.&nbsp; The two are related but not the same.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the difference is critical if we want&nbsp;a system that meets\r\n\r\nthe needs of the users.&quot;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an increasingly global\r\n\r\ncompetitive economy, one cannot argue that economic growth is fundamental to\r\n\r\nSingapore's continued success.&nbsp; We must make every <p align=left>Column: 373</p>effort to embrace the\r\n\r\nnecessary changes and continue to generate economic growth.&nbsp; But as\r\n\r\nPresident Nathan has said in his Address, Singapore is poised for success but\r\n\r\nnow stands at a turning point.&nbsp; With globalisation and as our population\r\n\r\nages, we must adapt.&nbsp; But how we respond to globalisation and address the\r\n\r\nchallenges of our ageing population will shape the future of Singapore.&nbsp; I\r\n\r\nbelieve that a subtle but important focus must be that of ensuring that we do\r\n\r\nnot forget people. Singapore is known for characteristics, such as being green,\r\n\r\nclean, efficient, disciplined, reliable, of high quality and dynamic.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile we continue to work on the branding of Singapore, as a trusted and\r\n\r\nreliable place for investment and business, making every effort to attract\r\n\r\nforeign talent, we must also continue to pay attention to our local talent and\r\n\r\nwhat Singapore branding means for us.&nbsp; This is important if we are to\r\n\r\nbuild a sense of belonging, identity and enthuse the desire to stay and to\r\n\r\nbuild Singapore's future.&nbsp; Paradoxically, the best ambassadors to attract\r\n\r\ntalent and to sell the Singapore brand are Singaporeans who have a strong\r\n\r\nidentity and pride in Singapore and are able to consistently project\r\n\r\nthat.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area of policy\r\n\r\nchange required is the need to increase our foreign talent and migration as\r\n\r\nSingapore's current population is small and replacement rates will limit our\r\n\r\nability to support economic growth for our future.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;not an\r\n\r\neasy policy change as it brings with it fears and competition and other social\r\n\r\nintegration concerns.&nbsp; How we manage this and how our citizens understand\r\n\r\nthe importance of foreign talent while addressing their fears and concerns will\r\n\r\ndetermine our future success, not only to attract foreign talent but to retain\r\n\r\nand to grow local talent.&nbsp; The question in the minds of many Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nat least those that I have met through my engagement<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>is: can I count on <p align=left>Column: 374</p>Singapore and can\r\n\r\nSingapore count on me when the moment of truth is here?<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic success is\r\n\r\nnecessary but insufficient as an ingredient for long-term identity and why\r\n\r\nSingapore is home for us.&nbsp; If economic success is the only criterion, our\r\n\r\npeople will just leave Singapore and go wherever economic opportunities present\r\n\r\nthemselves. &nbsp;I am not just referring to those physically residing in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but Singaporean overseas as well.&nbsp; What will make Singaporeans\r\n\r\nstay or come back?

I have been a member of this running group for about two years now,\r\n\r\nand it does baffle me every time I think about it, how all the members in this\r\n\r\ngroup make it a point every Sunday morning, week after week, to get up early to\r\n\r\nmeet at 6.30 in the morning to run.&nbsp; Why do we keep at it?&nbsp; Apart\r\n\r\nfrom the fact that we all do enjoy running, the very camaraderie and the\r\n\r\nsupport that the running group provides is what keeps us going.&nbsp; I must\r\n\r\nconfess that the reward of a good breakfast after that is also the other\r\n\r\nincentive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are all of\r\n\r\ndifferent&nbsp;fitness levels, age and running ability and, if I may say,\r\n\r\nshapes and sizes as well.&nbsp; We have folks that walk, others who walk and\r\n\r\nrun, and there are those who are really strong runners.&nbsp; However, our end\r\n\r\ngoal is the same - to complete the run and to reach the end\r\n\r\npoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point to note is that every person needs to do\r\n\r\nthe run himself.&nbsp; The motivation and the support of the group however\r\n\r\nprovide a key element that keeps folks running week after week and, in fact,\r\n\r\nhas helped members of the group improve on their running skills. We have folks\r\n\r\nlike me who have never run more than&nbsp;four kilometres before I joined this\r\n\r\ngroup being able to&nbsp;complete the marathon this year.&nbsp; There are\r\n\r\nothers, who barely could run the 10 kilometres, now completing the half\r\n\r\nmarathon in about two hours.&nbsp; What is interesting is that it does not stop\r\n\r\nthere.&nbsp; I have noticed that each member of the team continues to improve\r\n\r\nin&nbsp;his performance over time.

While the\r\n\r\nwhole-of-government approach is critical to addressing issues more coherently\r\n\r\nfor individuals and businesses, I feel that more can be done to ensure that we\r\n\r\ndo not forget the very people these policies are meant to support.&nbsp; I will\r\n\r\ngive you a very simple example.&nbsp; I had feedback from someone recently\r\n\r\ntrying to register her business.&nbsp; It was great that the various\r\n\r\nagencies&nbsp; provided her the ability to go online to register her\r\n\r\nbusiness.&nbsp; However, she proceeded to go online to register.&nbsp; She was\r\n\r\nprompted that she had to apply for a business licence from another agency\r\n\r\nbefore she could complete the business registration.&nbsp; She then went to the\r\n\r\nother agency's website&nbsp;to submit her application via the online business\r\n\r\nlicensing service.&nbsp; As she proceeded, she was then prompted that she\r\n\r\nneeded to provide her registration or RGB No. which was what she had originally\r\n\r\nbeen attempting to obtain.&nbsp; So you can imagine her frustration as she was\r\n\r\nnow stuck on both online applications requiring&nbsp;input from each other in\r\n\r\norder to complete her registration online.&nbsp; While I am glad to say that\r\n\r\n-&nbsp;I did ask her and she said, &quot;Yes, I set up my business.&quot;\r\n\r\n-&nbsp;it took a lot of follow-up, emails and phone calls before she got the\r\n\r\nmatter resolved.&nbsp; So a person with less perseverance would have given\r\n\r\nup.&nbsp; The whole-of-government approach would definitely have made a\r\n\r\ndifference to her in this experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 379</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So what has changed?&nbsp; The announcement\r\n\r\nactually explains why.&nbsp; It says, &quot;The changes have been made because\r\n\r\napplicants have often been puzzled when they read the fields required for the\r\n\r\napplication.&quot;&nbsp; And I applaud the agency for taking the feedback and\r\n\r\nacting on it, as they have now allowed users to skip the fields of where these\r\n\r\ngaps existed.&nbsp; So it is a good example of this one Government approach and\r\n\r\nmeeting the original intent of the online service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Interestingly, statistics have\r\n\r\nalso shown that as people age, their chances of developing some form\r\n\r\nof&nbsp;mobility problem are as high as 33%.&nbsp; By simple arithmetic, this\r\n\r\nwill work out to about 300,000 affected Singaporeans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Australians\r\n\r\nwho are in need only need to knock on one door to receive support from many\r\n\r\nother agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could adopt such a policy to provide our less\r\n\r\nprivileged fellow Singaporeans the one open door that would lead them to receiving\r\n\r\nsupport from &quot;many helping hands&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this will\r\n\r\nmean that we become more involved and responsible for the assistance provided\r\n\r\nto our people with disabilities.&nbsp; To mild this effect, we could look into\r\n\r\nencouraging more caregivers to assist the individual disabled person.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 384</p>However, we do recognise that not every person with disabilities has family\r\n\r\nmembers who are able to care and support them.&nbsp;

At this\r\n\r\npoint, I am suggesting that we, like in the United Kingdom, adopt the\r\n\r\ncaregiver's allowance.&nbsp; The caregiver's allowance is not only limited to\r\n\r\nthe family members, but anyone who is spending a reasonable amount of time to\r\n\r\nlook after the disabled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is a fair implementation as these caregivers\r\n\r\nspend time, care and money to assist the disabled individuals.&nbsp; In Osaka\r\n\r\nCity, Japan, caregivers are paid an allowance of 100,000 yen a year for providing\r\n\r\nnursing care to the elderly family members.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I believe\r\n\r\nsuch a policy could also suggest an alternative part-time work to some.&nbsp; I\r\n\r\nalso believe active participation in such community services would help to nurture\r\n\r\nand mould a better character of Singaporeans, especially the young.&nbsp; Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we need to determine the acceptable criteria to be eligible for such\r\n\r\nallowances, and the allowance need not be a hefty payout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=left>Column: 385</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also, with a ratio\r\n\r\nof 150 wheelchair-accessible buses to over 2,700 buses it owns, it will\r\n\r\nprobably take another five to 10 years before SBS Transit could provide the wheelchair-accessible\r\n\r\nfeatures in all its buses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We should consider\r\n\r\nfine-tuning our urban planning and licensing parameters to provide a conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment for such efforts to take off.
