Will the Member formally\r\n\r\nmove both amendments before he proceeds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nI accordingly move the amendments* standing in my \r\n\r\nname as shown on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put in the amendments because I am not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the Government's effort in  respect\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Health. We are familiar  with\r\n\r\nPress   reports  nowadays  about  all   sorts   of\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases and epidemics. We  have  read\r\n\r\nreports of doctors resigning from the service  and\r\n\r\npatients  not  well  looked  after  because  of  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  doctors.  There  is,  therefore,  an\r\n\r\ninsufficient number of doctors to look  after  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the poor people living in outlying areas have\r\n\r\nto go to Government clinics, they have to spend\r\n\r\nmoney on transport,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  for treatment at certain City Council clinics\r\n\r\nthey  have to pay fees. If these clinics  are  too\r\n\r\nfar  away  from  their homes,  they  have  to  see\r\n\r\nprivate doctors and the fees are a burden on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There seems to be a\r\n\r\nbreakdown in the translation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Another reason\r\n\r\nis   that  on  Sundays  and  public  holidays,  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  in  the  night, there are  insufficient\r\n\r\ndoctors  in the hospitals to go on shift  duty  to\r\n\r\nattend to serious cases like accidents, where  the\r\n\r\npatients  have  to  wait  for  a  long  time   for\r\n\r\ntreatment.  This  causes  the  situation   to   be\r\n\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few months we could not find any\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the food served to  patients  and\r\n\r\nthey, of course, cannot recover quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point we would like to clarify is this:\r\n\r\nthere  have been two outbreaks of cholera.  Is  it\r\n\r\ndue  to  water  rationing? If  it  is,  then  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  is  the  Ministry of  Health  taking  to\r\n\r\nimprove the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on dental care. This is also insufficient in\r\n\r\naided   schools.  Government  schools  are  better\r\n\r\nlooked  after  than aided schools.  Although  some\r\n\r\nstudents  from Chinese schools were  recruited  as\r\n\r\nnurses, they were actually not well trained.  What\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  the Ministry take  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation?  How many more regional  hospitals  can\r\n\r\nthe  Government set up to provide medical care for\r\n\r\nthe  people? At the moment, the provision of drugs\r\n\r\nand  medicines  and maternal care at  the  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad Hospital during the night is also inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also learn that the Cleansing Department\r\n\r\nintends to extend the hours of water rationing  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  so that there will  be  a  greater\r\n\r\nsupply  of water in other areas. This is  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of cleaning the drains. The extended  time\r\n\r\nof water supply in these areas is still not enough\r\n\r\nbecause certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarkets  in these areas cannot be cleaned  properly.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Department think of better ways  to  clean\r\n\r\nthese  markets  and  so  help improve  the  sanitary\r\n\r\nconditions generally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health is asking for an increased\r\n\r\nprovision of drugs and medicines but this  has  been\r\n\r\nturned  down by the Minister for Finance. We do  not\r\n\r\nthink  this is proper. This is not a good policy  of\r\n\r\neconomising.  Money should be spent on buying  drugs\r\n\r\nand  medicines  for the welfare of  the  people.  In\r\n\r\nseveral hospitals and clinics patients have to queue\r\n\r\nup  for registration for treatment. Can the Ministry\r\n\r\ndevise  any method of making it more convenient  for\r\n\r\nthe patients to register so that they need not waste\r\n\r\nso  much of their time queuing up before they can be\r\n\r\ntreated at these clinics?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Ministry is still unable\r\n\r\nto  look after the welfare of the hawkers. There are\r\n\r\nabout  50,000  to 60,000 hawkers in  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthey    have   formed   themselves   into   hawkers'\r\n\r\norganisations.  These organisations can  look  after\r\n\r\nthe hawkers but the Government have not been very co-operative  with  them. On the  contrary,  they  have\r\n\r\nbanned  some  of  these  organisations.  They   have\r\n\r\nadopted certain measures which are better than those\r\n\r\nof  the  Lim Yew Hock Government, but we are of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that these measures are not adequate enough.\r\n\r\nAdequate shelters and hawking space should be  given\r\n\r\nto  the hawkers, but the Government are levying high\r\n\r\nlicence fees for their stalls, and in certain places\r\n\r\nthere  is  little hawking space as these places  are\r\n\r\nvery crowded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, the Member\r\n\r\nis  making  unusually extensive  references  to  his\r\n\r\nnotes.

So in order to make a\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  have to refer to my main points  in  the\r\n\r\noutline. This is necessary in the course of making a\r\n\r\nspeech   in  order  to  be  able  to  give  a   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  picture. I  am  not  reading  from  a\r\n\r\nprepared text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the relevant Ministry of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide adequate protection  for  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  and the general public. This will help  the\r\n\r\nhawkers in their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another instance. The hawkers in Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  are not very well looked after. In  the  day-time there are hawkers' stalls at certain bus stops.\r\n\r\nAt night they do some other odd jobs. The Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  able to look after  these  hawkers.\r\n\r\nThere are several eating stalls in Geylang Serai. As\r\n\r\nfrom  last  March  they were asked  to  leave  their\r\n\r\nplaces.  But  since then they have not  been  looked\r\n\r\nafter  by  the  Government. They, therefore,  cannot\r\n\r\ncarry on their business and make a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mentioning all these matters in order to\r\n\r\npoint  out that there is inadequacy in the  services\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Health. Since the P.A.P. have now\r\n\r\ncome into office, can the Government from now on try\r\n\r\nto  do something better in order to improve the  lot\r\n\r\nof the hawkers as well as the general public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tampines has talked\r\n\r\nat great length just now.

It is a very  unlucky\r\n\r\nnumber,   Sir   - like   the  13   Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen. That is their trade mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started first by talking about the resignation\r\n\r\nof  doctors. I believe a similar question was put to\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government at Kuala Lumpur, and it  was\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister who answered to the effect  that\r\n\r\nunfortunately quite a number of doctors  spent  some\r\n\r\ntime  in  Government service and then suddenly  they\r\n\r\nappeared  to  be bitten by the money  bug  and  they\r\n\r\ndecided  to resign from Government service  arid  go\r\n\r\ninto  private practice. That unfortunately  is  also\r\n\r\nthe  situation  in Singapore. But this  shortage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors is not typical only for Singapore or for the\r\n\r\nFederation. It is worldwide. This is because  people\r\n\r\nare  now  getting more accustomed to  employing  the\r\n\r\nservices of doctors for their illnesses and ailments\r\n\r\nand there is a crying need for medical attention. It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, a world-wide shortage from which  we\r\n\r\nourselves suffer. May I, however, say that Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  consider  itself  lucky because  the  ratio  of\r\n\r\ndoctors to population is fairly good in our case. It\r\n\r\nis  one  doctor  to about 2,200 of  the  population.\r\n\r\nwhereas  I  believe in Malaya it is  one  doctor  to\r\n\r\n7,000 of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>\r\n\r\nIndonesia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think we do not get\r\n\r\nstatistics   from  the  heartland  of  our   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Assemblymen. There has  been  very  little\r\n\r\ninformation from that quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have a little over 700 qualified\r\n\r\ndoctors  in  Singapore,  of  whom  one-half  are  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service.  The  remaining  half  are   in\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractice. There have been resignations in the  past.\r\n\r\nBut  since  I assumed office as Minister for  Health\r\n\r\nfor  the  last two months, there has been  only  one\r\n\r\nresignation of a doctor who is a temporary  officer.\r\n\r\nShe  is  an  expatriate who is leaving Singapore  to\r\n\r\njoin  her husband elsewhere. So I think it is pretty\r\n\r\ndifficult  to try to remedy the shortage because  it\r\n\r\ntakes  at least six years for a doctor to go through\r\n\r\nuniversity training and an extra year as a  houseman\r\n\r\nbefore  he is permitted to practise. So I am afraid,\r\n\r\nfor  that reason, there is no solution in sight. But\r\n\r\nwe  can  remedy the situation somewhat by  making  a\r\n\r\ngreater   effort  to  recruit  and  train  auxiliary\r\n\r\nmedical personnel. By that, I mean junior staff like\r\n\r\nlaboratory    technicians,   hospital    assistants,\r\n\r\nassistant nurses, dental nurses, and so on. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  possible  to  increase the  recruitment  and\r\n\r\ntraining  of  these personnel within the  forseeable\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the second point mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tampines is this. He was referring to the hours\r\n\r\nduring  which our out-patient clinics  are  open  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  people throughout  the  State.  As\r\n\r\nstated  in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,\r\n\r\nwe  have  unfortunately  expanded  in  this  respect\r\n\r\nfaster than we were able to get doctors to man them.\r\n\r\nMay  I  read this particular paragraph of the speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara in Hansard  of  29th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1963, column 124:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The shortage in doctors is being slowly overcome,\r\n\r\nbut  the extension of Government clinics and  health\r\n\r\nfacilities  has  been  at a  higher  rate  than  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment    of    new   doctors,   Administrative\r\n\r\nefficiency and tightening of \"referrals\" from  these\r\n\r\nclinics to the hospitals are essential if the strain\r\n\r\non the medical staff is to be checked,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat the word \"strain\". It means\r\n\r\nthat  we  have less doctors and staff than we  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  have  to  man  these  clinics,  be   they\r\n\r\noutpatient  clinics  or maternal  and  child  health\r\n\r\ncentres.  I  say this and this is what  our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his  Budget  speech  on  the  28th  of\r\n\r\nNovember, 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- I refer to Hansard again col. 97 - said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The expansion in outdoor medical service brought\r\n\r\nabout  a  severe  strain  on the  available  medical\r\n\r\nstaff,  and nurses and doctors had to work long  and\r\n\r\npunishing hours to maintain the enlarged services,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a limit to human endurance. May I\r\n\r\nsay,  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  I  wish  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly to pay the highest tribute  to  those\r\n\r\nfew  but loyal and dedicated doctors and nurses  who\r\n\r\nare  serving  our  people, be they  hospitals,  out-patient  clinics  or maternal child health  centres,\r\n\r\nand  trying  to cope with the tremendous demand  for\r\n\r\nmedical  services required by our people.

(In Mandarin) I\r\n\r\ndo  not have any complaint against the doctors. What\r\n\r\nI  am complaining is that the time is very short  at\r\n\r\nthe out-patient clinics. The whole situation is as a\r\n\r\nresult of the Government's policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

He\r\n\r\nwas  complaining that doctors will not be  available\r\n\r\nfor a sufficiently long period of time to look after\r\n\r\nsick  people.  I  have explained  that  doctors  are\r\n\r\nhuman.  There are too few doctors and too few nurses\r\n\r\nto  meet  the thousands of cases that come to  them.\r\n\r\nYou  do not want the doctors and nurses to fall flat\r\n\r\nand  have  a  nervous breakdown, because then  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no doctors and nurses to look after  them.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why I say, be understanding and human  and\r\n\r\nnot  act  irresponsibly.

Mr Minister, please leave\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tampines alone. He did not ask for  a\r\n\r\nclinic  in  his  own  house.  Try  to  refrain  from\r\n\r\npersonal attacks. Please proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Very well, Sir. The third\r\n\r\npoint,  I believe, is about the conditions  in  Woodbridge  Hospital. Yes, there is overcrowding  there,\r\n\r\nand there is also a committee studying the situation\r\n\r\nin  Woodbridge Hospital. But I can assure you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  there are lots of people in this Assembly  who\r\n\r\ncould find a place in this hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point - that on Sundays, public holidays\r\n\r\nand  at  nights  there  are not  sufficient  doctors\r\n\r\navailable  - I  believe that point has  already  been\r\n\r\ncovered  when  I explained that unfortunately  there\r\n\r\nare  not  enough doctors in Singapore that Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  like to have, and therefore certain  services\r\n\r\nhave to be reduced, and doctors, nurses, attendants,\r\n\r\nclerks, hospital attendants, etc., being human, must\r\n\r\nalso  have their days of rest before they  can  look\r\n\r\nafter sick people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point - poor food in hospitals. It is\r\n\r\nquite  easy just to pick on that. Even in university\r\n\r\nhostels,  food can be considered bad. It is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple complaint. It should be put right, of course,\r\n\r\nbut  there  will always be complaints  however  much\r\n\r\neffort may be made in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to cholera. It is unfortunate that\r\n\r\nthere have been two outbreaks of cholera within  the\r\n\r\nlast  six months in Singapore, in fact, in the whole\r\n\r\nof  Malaya. But I must say that there are  perpetual\r\n\r\noutbreaks  in other countries like the heartland  of\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan   Sosialis,  be  it   Indonesia,   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  or the China mainland. I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nreasonable  to suggest that the water  shortage  and\r\n\r\nwater rationing has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  part to play in these outbreaks. But what  are\r\n\r\nwe  to  do if there is no adequate rainfall  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  to have water rationing? We can only hope that\r\n\r\nif  the Assemblymen from the Barisan Sosialis  would\r\n\r\npray  hard enough, there would be more rain for  all\r\n\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh point referred to the school health\r\n\r\nservice  and  an allegation that students  in  aided\r\n\r\nschools  are  not as well looked after as  those  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools. There are  in  all  only  seven\r\n\r\ndoctors  in the school health service to look  after\r\n\r\n416,000 pupils. I ask the Member for Tampines to  do\r\n\r\na little bit of mental arithmetic to see how and why\r\n\r\nit  is  almost impossible for those few  doctors  to\r\n\r\nlook after 400,000 pupils. The allegation that aided\r\n\r\nschools   are  being  ignored  is  entirely  untrue.\r\n\r\nBecause of the few doctors that are available,  what\r\n\r\nis  now  possible is only the examination of  school\r\n\r\npupils when they enter school at Primary I and  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  at  Primary VI, and again when  they  are\r\n\r\nabout to leave secondary school. Of course, we would\r\n\r\nlike  to be able to expand the school health service\r\n\r\nto  make  it  possible for our children  to  receive\r\n\r\nmedical  attention throughout the year. But I  think\r\n\r\nit  will take a very, very long time before we  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  the position to have adequate staff to  cope\r\n\r\nwith   the   tremendous  increase  in   our   school\r\n\r\npopulation over the last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth point, Mr Speaker, Sir, was on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  recruitment of staff like nurses  from\r\n\r\nother  than  English schools. Never, I  think,  have\r\n\r\nthere  been  attempts to recruit nurses  from  other\r\n\r\nthan  English schools in the past and we were  quite\r\n\r\nhappy. I believe, in 1960 to make the experiment  to\r\n\r\nsecond  two  teachers from a Chinese  school  and  a\r\n\r\nMalay  school  to  be attached to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  in  order  to  recruit school  leavers  from\r\n\r\nChinese and Malay schools. They received my approval\r\n\r\nand I can assure the Member for Tampines that I hope\r\n\r\nto be able to do more than what was done a few years\r\n\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that since almost everything is done\r\n\r\nin  English,  there are difficulties  in  trying  to\r\n\r\nbridge this language gap. But it is a problem which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  hope  I  will  be able to improve upon  if  given\r\n\r\nadequate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's ninth point refers to hospitals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, we\r\n\r\nhave   already  indicated  that  the  Thomson   Road\r\n\r\nHospital will become the second General Hospital  in\r\n\r\na  few  months' time. It is not possible for  me  to\r\n\r\nanticipate further than this because the speech only\r\n\r\nrefers to 1964 and the second Five-Year Plan 1965-69\r\n\r\nis now in the process of being drawn up. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tampines will be patient enough to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  the  publication of this second Five-Year  Plan\r\n\r\nwhen the question of a third and, possibly, a fourth\r\n\r\ngeneral hospital to be established in Singapore will\r\n\r\nbe revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenth point referred to the recent relaxation\r\n\r\nof  water rationing by the Public Utilities Board to\r\n\r\ncope  with  the  cholera  situation.  If  our  water\r\n\r\nsituation  improves - I think it  is  improving  now,\r\n\r\nprobably  thanks  to the prayer of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines; it is raining outside - there will not only\r\n\r\nbe a further relaxation of water rationing but maybe\r\n\r\nwater rationing will not be necessary, and then this\r\n\r\nextension of two hours from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. may be\r\n\r\nimproved. As regards timing, well, it could  be  one\r\n\r\nway  or another. I think we have to accept the  fact\r\n\r\nthat we are lucky to be able to have a relaxation in\r\n\r\nthe  water  rationing, so that there  are  two  more\r\n\r\nadditional  hours for our city cleansing workers  to\r\n\r\nclean  up  not only the drains that are choked  with\r\n\r\nrubbish  over  a long period of time,  but  also  to\r\n\r\ncleanse our markets all over Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eleventh allegation was that my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance,  has  been  very  unkind  by\r\n\r\ncutting  down  requests for drugs and  chemicals.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Tampines would be raising  this\r\n\r\nsubsequently  and  so  I shall not  anticipate  this\r\n\r\nquestion and will deal with it when the time  comes.\r\n\r\nAll  I can say is that what he said is not true. But\r\n\r\nI  will  give  him a full answer if the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines will raise it subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelfth point refers to patients queuing up\r\n\r\nfor attention. Well, if there are only a few doctors\r\n\r\nand  more patients, that is to be expected. We would\r\n\r\nlike to have more doctors, and therefore there would\r\n\r\nbe  shorter queues. But that will take a long  time.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] Yes, my colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development, says that our clinics must  be\r\n\r\nvery  popular and so they are prepared to  queue  up\r\n\r\nlike queuing up for the cinema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Have\r\n\r\nyou anything like that in Indonesia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> His thirteenth and last\r\n\r\nquestion - hawkers. He alleges that there are  50,000\r\n\r\nto   60,000   hawkers.  I  think  the  figures   are\r\n\r\nexaggerated by 50 per cent. I think there are  about\r\n\r\n40,000 hawkers in Singapore. Here again, there is  a\r\n\r\nquestion tabled by him which will come up for answer\r\n\r\ntomorrow. I shall not anticipate the question and  I\r\n\r\nshall give him the answer in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech was quite\r\n\r\nclear  at  column 124 where we came forward  with  a\r\n\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the Public Health side, the Ministry is\r\n\r\nplanning  a  reorganisation of  the  City  Cleansing\r\n\r\nservices,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I will skip a few lines and go on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and the ... huge increase in the number of\r\n\r\nhawkers, inadequate methods of supervision resulting\r\n\r\nin lack of discipline in the work force, complicated\r\n\r\nby  secret  society  elements in their  midst,  have\r\n\r\nbrought  about  an  increase in rubbish,  flies  and\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  All  this can and will  be  put  right.\r\n\r\nReorganisation can succeed once these  factors  have\r\n\r\nbeen dealt with,'\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  hawker  problem  is part  and  parcel  of  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation which the Government  will  put  into\r\n\r\noperation  and  I  think  the  best  part   of   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation is the banning of the  two  Singapore\r\n\r\nhawkers'  unions which were the front  organisations\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have been able to answer all the 13\r\n\r\nquestions put up by the Barisan Sosialis to the best\r\n\r\nof  my ability and I assure them that reorganisation\r\n\r\nis  coming. I do hope that I will get the support of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen in putting matters\r\n\r\nright for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  the  Minister in  his  reply  did  not\r\n\r\nmention  \"Communism\" or \"Communists\". This  is  very\r\n\r\nrare  indeed. But it cannot be denied that  although\r\n\r\nhe  has  given fair answers, he has also made  other\r\n\r\nallegations against us. I will say something on  the\r\n\r\nviews he has expressed and on his allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is about the shortage of doctors. The\r\n\r\nMinister has said that many doctors in Singapore  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  those  in Malaya resigned from  Government\r\n\r\nservice in order to practise privately for pecuniary\r\n\r\nreasons.  That  was his excuse for the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors. As has been admitted by the Minister,  half\r\n\r\nthe   doctors  in  Singapore  are  employed  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health. If there is still  this  large\r\n\r\nnumber of doctors employed, why did he say that more\r\n\r\ndoctors  resigned from the Government to  make  more\r\n\r\nmoney  in private practice? I would like to  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter explanation from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Health will be able to\r\n\r\nrecruit  more doctors to serve in the hospitals  and\r\n\r\nclinics.  If  the  doctors are not  satisfied  with\r\n\r\ntheir  working  conditions, the Minister  should  be\r\n\r\npatient with them and hear their views so that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  content  to remain in their  jobs.  Nobody\r\n\r\nwants  to  be  ill but if a person  falls  sick,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  will  have  to see  a  doctor.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not accommodate the  views  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  on their working conditions, then naturally\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a shortage of doctors. The  Minister\r\n\r\nalleged that many doctors resigned because they were\r\n\r\nnot satisfied with their terms of service. There are\r\n\r\nclinics as well as the Thomson Road Hospital and the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital which are under-staffed. There  is\r\n\r\nalso  a shortage of nurses. As a result of this,  an\r\n\r\nindisposed person will find it difficult to go to  a\r\n\r\nclinic  or  a hospital to see a doctor or  a  nurse.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I hope the Minister will try to  recruit\r\n\r\nmore  nurses for the various clinics and  hospitals,\r\n\r\notherwise the people might think that the nurses are\r\n\r\nunwilling  to serve them. They might not  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  are insufficient nurses. We all know  that  a\r\n\r\nsmall  number of nurses cannot look after  too  many\r\n\r\npatients.  Of  course, it is a very  good  thing  to\r\n\r\nrecruit nurses from all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  of the four streams, otherwise many school-leavers will be unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree with the Minister that\r\n\r\nwe should pray to God for more rainfall. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is raining outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Today we have to\r\n\r\npray.

The  sooner the project is  completed  the\r\n\r\nearlier  the people of Singapore will be  free  from\r\n\r\nwater  rationing due to water shortage. If it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion   of  shortage  of  funds,  it  is   really\r\n\r\nunbelievable,  as  the Government have  spent  about\r\n\r\n$100  million on T.V. alone. If they had spent  this\r\n\r\nsum of $100 million on the Johore River project,  we\r\n\r\nwould not be experiencing a water shortage today and\r\n\r\nthe incidence of disease and epidemics would be very\r\n\r\nmuch less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Sneaker, Sir, just now the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health has explained to the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  that the shortage of doctors is  riot  only\r\n\r\nconfined  to  Singapore  or,  for  that  matter,  to\r\n\r\nMalaya,  but that it is a universal problem.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  an easy matter to recruit doctors, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  They  must  be trained for a number  of  years\r\n\r\nbefore  they  can be considered as capable  doctors.\r\n\r\nThe Minister says one doctor caters for 2,000 people\r\n\r\nand  it  will take a lone time to achieve  this.  We\r\n\r\nhave  doctors in Singapore but most of  those  whose\r\n\r\nsympathies  are  with the Barisan Sosialis  resigned\r\n\r\nfrom  Government not because they wanted to go  into\r\n\r\nprivate  practice but because they wanted to  encage\r\n\r\nthemselves in political activities. I think if these\r\n\r\ndoctors  were to discharge their duties as  doctors,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  of greater benefit to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

There  is  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of $31,070. It is not right  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe money provided for drugs and chemicals because\r\n\r\nit means a reduction of drugs and chemicals, which\r\n\r\nare  very  important in the treatment of patients.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  very  important  item  and  yet   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has reduced the provision for it.

In  the  1963  Estimates   the\r\n\r\nprovision was $507,830, whereas the Estimates  for\r\n\r\n1964   show  $442,830.  Therefore,  there   is   a\r\n\r\nreduction of $65,000.

Last  year the provision  was  $155,000\r\n\r\nwhereas  this  year it is only $146.000.

The provision for last year was $22,000,\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  provision  for  this  year  is  only\r\n\r\n$20,000.

The\r\n\r\nprovision  for last year was $72,500, whereas  the\r\n\r\nestimates provided for this year are only $70,580.\r\n\r\nThis is another reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sc in the estimates for 1964 the Government have\r\n\r\nprovided more money for those items which  do  not\r\n\r\naffect  the  livelihood  of  the  people.

What I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say is this.

For 1963\r\n\r\n- there is still about a month to go - we have made  a\r\n\r\nprojection of the estimated expenditure, so  perhaps\r\n\r\nI will just quickly run through the figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the General Hospital for this year, we have a\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $723,000, but I think we  will  spend\r\n\r\nonly  $673,480.  Therefore, the  1964  provision  of\r\n\r\n$691,930  should be adequate. I think it goes  right\r\n\r\ndown  all  the hospitals in a similar way. The  only\r\n\r\none  is  Middleton Hospital where we had a provision\r\n\r\nof   $22,000  and  our  anticipated  expenditure  is\r\n\r\n$21,000   for  this  year  because  of  the  cholera\r\n\r\nepidemic  which  occurred twice, and  for  1964  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $20,000 may not be  adequate.  But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the Treasury has always been  reasonable\r\n\r\nand whenever there is a request for additional money\r\n\r\nto purchase drugs, it never says no. So I can assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tampines that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nwould be able to get adequate money to purchase  all\r\n\r\nthe  drugs  and chemicals that will be  required  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  efficient medical services. I myself  will\r\n\r\nbe  worried  if I cannot get the money.  But  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that  it has been the practice  of  the\r\n\r\nTreasury to provide the money if we can make a  case\r\n\r\nfor the purchase of drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  could see that the attitude of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth   towards  the  medical  services   is   more\r\n\r\nreasonable than that of the other Ministers.

For example, in the markets  and  in  the\r\n\r\nareas where there are a lot of hawkers, rubbish  has\r\n\r\nbeen  piled  up and has not been cleared away.  Many\r\n\r\npeople  have complained that the public toilets  are\r\n\r\ndirty.  Is the Minister for Health prepared to  take\r\n\r\nsteps to improve health and sanitary conditions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. There are many drains,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the rural areas, which, because  they\r\n\r\nare  blocked, create stagnant pools of  water.  This\r\n\r\ncondition  breeds mosquitoes. In the past, personnel\r\n\r\nfrom the Anti-Malarial Department would go round and\r\n\r\nspray  chemicals  to  kill the mosquitoes.  Has  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health taken into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nwork  that has been done by this Department? Is  he\r\n\r\nthinking of any step to resolve this situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have\r\n\r\nalready  partly dealt, with the question  of  public\r\n\r\nhealth.  In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech  it\r\n\r\nhas already been indicated that it is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintention  of the Ministry of Health to reorganise\r\n\r\nthe  City  Cleansing  Service  which,  of  course,\r\n\r\nincludes  looking after the rural areas. Singapore\r\n\r\nis  so  small now and with the integration of  the\r\n\r\nCity Council with Government, it really means that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health is now looking  after  the\r\n\r\nwhole  island State of Singapore. So the  work  of\r\n\r\nclearing  rubbish,  drains  with  stagnant  water,\r\n\r\nflies  and mosquitoes - all that has been  accepted\r\n\r\nby  the Government, and it is our intention to get\r\n\r\ndown to tackling this problem. But the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson will recognise the fact that I became  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health only two months  ago.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  last month that we had the cholera epidemic,\r\n\r\nso  it was important that I should look after  the\r\n\r\ncholera  epidemic first. There is  only  one  week\r\n\r\nmore  to  go for the mass inoculations to  be  put\r\n\r\nthrough. At present I am glad to say that  700,000\r\n\r\nof   the  people  in  Singapore  have  had   their\r\n\r\ninoculations.  Before the second mass  inoculation\r\n\r\ncholera   campaign  started,  I   held   a   Press\r\n\r\nconference but it was only reported in full in the\r\n\r\nChinese  Press,  which I am sure  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  reads. I indicated then that I  would  go\r\n\r\ninto  various  drives, e.g., the fly extermination\r\n\r\ncampaign  in  March, Why March? It is  because  it\r\n\r\ntakes time first to organise properly. Secondly, I\r\n\r\nwant  to  get the schools to participate  in  this\r\n\r\nmovement  because the half million of  our  school\r\n\r\nchildren,  if they really get interested  in  this\r\n\r\nmovement, can influence their parents; and whether\r\n\r\nthey  are in the city areas or in the rural areas,\r\n\r\nthey will be able to look after their own rubbish.\r\n\r\nUp  to a point, there will be people who would  go\r\n\r\naround to clean the drains whether in the city  or\r\n\r\nin the rural areas. So there are plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it takes time for the plans to get into\r\n\r\nmotion.  I  can  assure  him  that  once  the  fly\r\n\r\nextermination campaign gets started for one  month\r\n\r\nin  March,  then it is our intention to raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard of health education for all - not just for\r\n\r\nschool children and parents, but also for hawkers.\r\n\r\nI think all of us accept the fact that, because of\r\n\r\nthe  huge  number of hawkers in Singapore  - it  is\r\n\r\npartly because of the unemployment situation in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore that they turn to hawking as a means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood - we have in Singapore more rubbish than\r\n\r\nusual and sometimes unfortunately hawkers so  hawk\r\n\r\nthat it is not possible to clean up their pitches.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  we  will be able to get  hawkers  to  be\r\n\r\nconscious  of  the  fact that  they  are  as  much\r\n\r\nresponsible for the public health in Singapore  as\r\n\r\nother people. In fact, our Prime Minister when  he\r\n\r\noutlined  the four tasks ahead for the  Government\r\n\r\nfor  the  next five years, did indicate  that  the\r\n\r\nfourth   target  would  be  to  raise  the  social\r\n\r\nstandards  of our people. There was one  reference\r\n\r\nwhere he said - I am quoting his words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I wish to emphasise higher standards of public\r\n\r\nand social conduct. This can be brought about by a\r\n\r\nsustained process of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inevitable that with new forms of popular\r\n\r\nand  representative government, hawkers, squatters\r\n\r\nand other social problems increase. But slowly  as\r\n\r\nsocial    standards   and   civic    consciousness\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  increase,  hawkers  for  instance\r\n\r\nbegin to understand that they must stay out of the\r\n\r\nmain  traffic routes and that they must for  their\r\n\r\nown sake maintain certain standards of cleanliness\r\n\r\nand hygiene. Litter, rubbish, flies and mosquitoes\r\n\r\nare  not  only the job of the Health Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the Cleansing Department, but  the\r\n\r\nsocial responsibility of all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All - every one of us. So I can assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson that I will not spare efforts to raise\r\n\r\nthe  standard of health education for everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and when I get started I hope  I  will\r\n\r\nreceive full co-operation from our friends  across\r\n\r\nthe Floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On the public health\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, firstly, the Government should bear\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility.

On the question\r\n\r\nof  atonement,  we  will condemn  the  P.A.P. for\r\n\r\nhaving  betrayed the people. If the  P.A.P. allow\r\n\r\nthe Japanese to delay and delay on the question of\r\n\r\natonement,  I  would like to ask the  P.A.P. what\r\n\r\nsteps  they  are going to take to deal  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter?

This  sum\r\n\r\nis  actually a provision by the Government  to  help\r\n\r\ntowards  the  building  of a  memorial  to  civilian\r\n\r\nvictims  of  the Japanese Occupation. In  July  this\r\n\r\nyear,   the  Government  agreed  with  the   various\r\n\r\nChambers  of Commerce in Singapore to take  part  in\r\n\r\nactivities in various parts of Singapore to set up a\r\n\r\nmemorial. The land for this memorial was donated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  which is near the sports-field  of\r\n\r\nRaffles Institution at Beach Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the memorial is expected to amount to\r\n\r\n$750,000.

The Government proposes to contribute  an\r\n\r\namount  equal  to half the fund, i.e.  $375,000.  So\r\n\r\nthis fund has nothing to do with atonement from  the\r\n\r\nJapanese,  but  provision has  to  be  made  in  the Budget,   whether   or   not   such   atonement   is\r\n\r\nforthcoming.

And they now  talk\r\n\r\nof  their  concern in this matter! Are  they  really\r\n\r\nconcerned about this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about the blood debt. Any matter\r\n\r\nrelating to foreign countries is now in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Government. Since the subject  of  the\r\n\r\nblood  debt comes under foreign relations,  it  also\r\n\r\ncomes   within  the  jurisdiction  of  the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.   In  the  past  month,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  have been negotiating with  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  this  question  of  blood  debt  and\r\n\r\natonement.  We  are waiting for the results  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tampines also talked about peace\r\n\r\nand  war.  He  said  that they  are  a  peace-loving\r\n\r\npeople.  They were shedding crocodile tears.  It  is\r\n\r\nthey  who want war. They want to create hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Thomson said that I was war-like  in\r\n\r\nmy   attitude.  I  have  never  given  any  war-like\r\n\r\nspeeches.  What I have said is that we have  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  thousand  troops while our neighbour  has  many\r\n\r\nmore.  So  how can we go to war with our  neighbour?\r\n\r\nOur neighbour has more than 30 jet planes --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour is not talking\r\n\r\non the amendment but is talking on something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You only insist\r\n\r\non  the  right to talk.

Had\r\n\r\nthere  been  no blood debt issue, there  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  no such question of a memorial to the civilian\r\n\r\nvictims  of  the Japanese Occupation.

That night the people requested\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce\r\n\r\nto  press  home the issue of the atonement with  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Government. Three resolutions were  passed\r\n\r\nduring  the  rally. They were, first, to unite  with\r\n\r\nall   the  people  of  Sarawak,  Sabah,  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  to press for the blood debt.  Second,  if\r\n\r\nthe  question of the blood debt is not  settled,  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  a  campaign of non-co-operation  with  the\r\n\r\nJapanese.

This is their sore spot.\r\n\r\nThey  dare  not talk about it. Why is  it  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. did  not invite the Tunku to the rally?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  he speak about the rally? Why is it that  at\r\n\r\nthat  time they forgot about the Central Government?\r\n\r\nWhen the Prime Minister was invited to the rally, he\r\n\r\nwent up the platform and made a speech. At that time\r\n\r\nthey did not remember about the jurisdiction of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government. Why is it? We are of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat  these three resolutions are correct. We demand\r\n\r\nthat  the Government should implement what they have\r\n\r\nsaid.  As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister  said\r\n\r\nat  the  rally, \"No doubt we are very indignant.  We\r\n\r\nare  full  of  anger, but we are at  the  same  time\r\n\r\ncivilised  people. We must adopt civilised  methods.\r\n\r\nSince  we  have given our pledge, we must carry  out\r\n\r\nour pledge. Otherwise no people will trust us.\" That\r\n\r\nmeans  to  say,  since the Government  have  allowed\r\n\r\nJapanese nationals to come to Singapore, they should\r\n\r\nnot  ask them to leave on account of the blood debt.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister said that since he had  given  a\r\n\r\npledge,  he  must implement it. But as  regards  the\r\n\r\nthree   resolutions  which  were  approved  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, why is it that they have not implemented\r\n\r\nit  by adopting action with the Federation and North\r\n\r\nBorneo to press for the claim by initiating a non-co-operation  movement against the Japanese?  Why  have\r\n\r\nthe  Government  not  prohibited Japanese  nationals\r\n\r\nfrom coming into Singapore? This is also one of  the\r\n\r\nresolutions.  I  shall read further  another  speech\r\n\r\nmade by the Prime Minister. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Tonight's rally is totally different. The rally\r\n\r\ntonight is being held in a very solemn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\natmosphere.  The Government had considered  it  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  before  it  organised  this  rally.  This\r\n\r\ndecision  is  very  significant. After  passing  the\r\n\r\nthree resolutions at tonight's rally, it would  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the Government's attitude towards the Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment will change. Once we adopt this  resolute\r\n\r\nstand,  we  must  insist that  reasonable  agreement\r\n\r\nshould be reached. The resolution tonight calls  for\r\n\r\nnon-co-operation with the Japanese Government. After\r\n\r\nthis  resolution  has been passed, people  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks of life and the Government must adopt a non-co-operation  movement  until  we  arrive  at  a   very\r\n\r\nreasonable  settlement. This decision  is  momentous\r\n\r\nand full of significance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  has  happened to this decision?  It  has  been\r\n\r\nforgotten by the Government. We have good reason  to\r\n\r\ndoubt  that in carrying out this blood debt campaign\r\n\r\nthe   Government  were  not  motivated  by   sincere\r\n\r\nintentions.  It was not motivated by the  desire  to\r\n\r\npress for compensation for the victims and for those\r\n\r\npeople who died during the Japanese Occupation.  The\r\n\r\ncampaign  was solely directed at gaining votes  from\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 27th August, it was reported in the Sin\r\n\r\nChew  Jit  Poh  that  a spokesman  of  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nForeign  Ministry said that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhad no status to resume negotiations on the question\r\n\r\nof  a  blood  debt and that the Japanese  Government\r\n\r\nwould  not  agree  to  the  big  sum  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government. But it  said  that  it  would\r\n\r\nagree  to  a certain gesture of atonement. When  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, visited Japan  in\r\n\r\nMay  last  year,  the  Japanese Government  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government had agreed that  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  build a park in  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ngesture of atonement for the war-time victims.  Have\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government denied that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwent  to  Japan  in May last year and  that  it  was\r\n\r\nagreed  that the Japanese Government should build  a\r\n\r\npark in Singapore as a gesture of atonement? That is\r\n\r\nwhat   the   P.A.P.  Government  want.  The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment are only contented with building  a  park\r\n\r\nand a memorial. They are forgetting the question  of\r\n\r\nthe   blood  debt  and  are  trying  to  shift   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility on to the Central Government.  It  is\r\n\r\neasy  to do this because the P.A.P. Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  that  all along. The P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhave seen fit to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblame   the   Barisan  Sosialis  for  the  so-called\r\n\r\ndisturbance  at  the rally. What evidence  can  they\r\n\r\nproduce to prove it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall give you a news item in the newspapers to indicate our stand and our attitude on this issue. We have made a statement that we fully support the claim for a blood debt. This statement was published on the 25th August in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. This statement says that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhad  written  to  the  Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce\r\n\r\nexplaining  the attitude of the Barisan Sosialis  to\r\n\r\nthe  question  of the blood debt. It says  that,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, we fully support the demand of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore for compensation for those victims who\r\n\r\nwere  murdered by the Japanese Military  during  the\r\n\r\nSecond World War. The letter also expressed its wish\r\n\r\nthat  the rally would be a success. This letter  was\r\n\r\npublished  on the day the mass rally was  held.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis attitude is very clear.  We  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the demand for compensation. But the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  order  to  monopolise the whole issue  tried  to\r\n\r\ncreate  tension  before the rally. They  spread  the\r\n\r\nrumour  that  some  people might sabotage  the  mass\r\n\r\nrally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done when the people were going to attend\r\n\r\nthe rally. At the same time, the Government issued a\r\n\r\nstatement.  There  is  no need  to  read  the  whole\r\n\r\nstatement because it will be a waste of time. I will\r\n\r\nonly  read  the  caption  which  says  \"The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  only  opposed Malaysia and was  trying  to\r\n\r\ncreate  trouble at the intended rally.\"  Before  the\r\n\r\nrally was held, the Government was spreading rumours\r\n\r\nthat  the  Barisan Sosialis was trying to wreck  the\r\n\r\nrally. Now, when people have not done anything,  how\r\n\r\ncan  you say that they have the intention to do  so?\r\n\r\nHow could the Government accuse the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nof  trying  to  wreck  the mass rally?  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  some  of  the unions  understood  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  intention, and therefore we exposed  them.\r\n\r\nIn  their  anger, they said we wanted to  wreck  the\r\n\r\nrally.  We exposed the fact that the P.A.P. did  not\r\n\r\nhave the real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintention  to  press  for  the  claim  against   the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Government.  What  they  wanted  was  only\r\n\r\npolitical   capital.   [Interruption]   The   Member\r\n\r\nopposite  can only indulge in abusing other  people.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  challenge them to produce evidence  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  we had intended to wreck the rally.  But\r\n\r\nthey  could  not do so. When they were bitten,  they\r\n\r\nwailed like a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir, we are sincere in our hope. We sincerely hope that not only should the Government provide $375,000 to build this memorial, but we also hope that they should not shirk their responsibility because they are in power and they have forgotten all their pledges and promises. They\r\n\r\nshould open fresh negotiations with the Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and start anew. They should spare no effort\r\n\r\nto achieve the goal in conjunction with the Chambers\r\n\r\nof  Commerce.  We  feel that  if  we  can  get  this\r\n\r\ncompensation, it will do a lot of good to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. At the same time, it will do good  to\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government. At least the P.A.P. can make\r\n\r\nuse  of  this money on education and not use it  for\r\n\r\ntheir own party purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, one thing\r\n\r\nabout the Barisan is that we know not only what they\r\n\r\nthink, but we know what they think before they think\r\n\r\nit. You will notice, Sir, that the amendment relates\r\n\r\nto  a  memorial  to  the  civilian  victims  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Occupation. But we were  quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  were not going to talk on this, but that  they\r\n\r\nwere  going to bring up another question  about  the\r\n\r\nblood  debt.  You can see, Sir, the  gentleman  from\r\n\r\nThomson  brought newspapers not to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nquestion --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young:</b> It is a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- but another question which is\r\n\r\nwithin  the  purview  of the Central  Government.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand a leader of their Party is now  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. But he has not got the guts to bring  it  up\r\n\r\nthere but these gentlemen bring it up here. Why? Why\r\n\r\ndoes their leader, who has not been in this Assembly\r\n\r\nfor the last one week, not bring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup the question in Kuala Lumpur? Because he knows if\r\n\r\nhe  brings  it up there, he will be in more  serious\r\n\r\ntrouble than these gentlemen would be by bringing it\r\n\r\nup  here. But this question has been brought up, and\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr Deputy Speaker, have allowed them to  deal\r\n\r\nnot  only with the question of the memorial  to  the\r\n\r\ncivilian victims - to which incidentally, may I  say,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Government are contributing $375,000;  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will contribute their share - but\r\n\r\nalso with the question of blood debt. But let it  be\r\n\r\nunderstood   that  by  the  time  the  memorial   is\r\n\r\nestablished, I am quite sure it would be a  memorial\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  our  people who were  killed  by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese, but also the victims of their friends, our\r\n\r\npeople  who  will  be killed by their  friends  when\r\n\r\nconfrontation starts. So it also becomes a  memorial\r\n\r\nto  the victims who are going to be killed by  their\r\n\r\nfriends. I hope, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis will\r\n\r\ncontribute  generously towards this  memorial  as  a\r\n\r\nmemorial which will be to the victims of traitors in\r\n\r\nour country. --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

They are not interested  in\r\n\r\ncompensation  for the poor victims of the  Japanese.\r\n\r\nFor  years the Communist Party has been here. It  is\r\n\r\nnow  operating  through the Barisan  Sosialis.  They\r\n\r\nnever  brought up this question. The  war  ended  in\r\n\r\n1945.  The  question came up in 1962. What  was  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Communist Party doing then? Why did they not\r\n\r\nbring  it up? Why did the Barisan Sosialis not bring\r\n\r\nit  up?  But they know any opportunity for mischief,\r\n\r\nany opportunity that will work up public feelings,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  opportunity  to create  disturbance  and\r\n\r\nriots the Communists are there, just like rats in  a\r\n\r\nrubbish  heap.  The Communists are always  around  a\r\n\r\nrubbish heap. That is why they are bringing up  this\r\n\r\nquestion,  not  because they are interested  in  the\r\n\r\nsufferings   of   the  victims   of   the   Japanese\r\n\r\nOccupation.   For  15  years  they  had   not   been\r\n\r\ninterested. But just before last year, when somebody\r\n\r\nelse  brought it up, these gentlemen, just like rats\r\n\r\ngathering  around a rubbish heap, were  there.  When\r\n\r\nthe  blood debt question came up - in fact, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  remind them, since they have brought it  up  here\r\n\r\nMr  Ng  Aik Huan told them to shut up. He  did  not\r\n\r\nwant their help. He did not want their assistance in\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat to them the advice given to them by one\r\n\r\nof  the leaders of the Chambers of Commerce who  are\r\n\r\ntrying to collect money. They said, \"For God's sake,\r\n\r\nplease  shut  up.  By the time you have  fought  the\r\n\r\ncause,  the cause is lost.\" So, therefore, they  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to get any thanks by poking their  noses\r\n\r\ninto  a  business in which I am quite sure they  are\r\n\r\nnot  really  interested. They are not interested  in\r\n\r\nthe  people who died during the Japanese Occupation.\r\n\r\nNor are they interested in the hundreds of thousands\r\n\r\nof  our people whom the Communists bumped off during\r\n\r\nthe  emergency.  I  am  quite  sure  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  even  if they read tomorrow  the  speech\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the Member for Thomson, are not going  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that he is really spending sleepless nights,\r\n\r\nshedding  tears in his room because of the thousands\r\n\r\nof people who had been killed before he was born.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  how old he is, Sir. But these  people\r\n\r\nwere  killed and I am quite sure neither  today  nor\r\n\r\ntomorrow nor since he was born, has he been shedding\r\n\r\ntears over the Japanese victims. But let me say this\r\n\r\nas far as the memorial is concerned. It is clear the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  quite prepared to do  its  share  by\r\n\r\ncontributing half the cost. The Chambers of Commerce\r\n\r\nwill get money to complete the project. There is one\r\n\r\nthing  about  the Barisan Sosialis.  Their  line  is\r\n\r\nthis. Not only here, Sir, but earlier in the debate.\r\n\r\nWe do the thinking. We are going to build the Tebrau\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks.  They  say,  \"Oh  good.  But  please  do   it\r\n\r\nquicker.\" We are going to put a hospital. They  say,\r\n\r\n\"Please put up more hospitals.\" We are going to have\r\n\r\nmore  doctors.  They say, \"Please  have  still  more\r\n\r\ndoctors.\"  All  they  do is to sit  there  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Please  have more of everything.\" If they  want  to\r\n\r\nget a little bit of free publicity by saying, \"Well,\r\n\r\nyou  know...\"  I  am sure, Sir, there  is  a  famous\r\n\r\nsaying  about  the cock which always  boasted,  \"You\r\n\r\nknow,  I am very powerful because every day  when  I\r\n\r\ncrow the sun rises.\" That is what they are trying to\r\n\r\ndo.  We  will do our job. This Budget is no fun.  We\r\n\r\nhave thought it out and we will do what is possible,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  practical, regardless of what the  Barisan\r\n\r\nsay. So let them crow. But whether they crow or  not\r\n\r\nthe sun will rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So similarly, Sir, as regards the memorial, we do\r\n\r\nnot  need  their  advice, their exhortations,  their\r\n\r\ndenunciations to say what we should do,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  already  decided to do  it.  The  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce have decided. They do not want their  help.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, they spurned their help. They said,  \"Shut\r\n\r\nup,   please.   Do  not  bring  this   question   up\r\n\r\nyourselves. We will do it.\" But they are  coming  in\r\n\r\npurely because they know confrontation is here, \"How\r\n\r\ncan we start trouble? A few more riots; something to\r\n\r\nwork  up  public  feelings. Maybe a riot  over  this\r\n\r\nblood debt issue. Maybe we could work up some riots.\r\n\r\nProbably the Japanese firms in Jurong, steel  mills,\r\n\r\nlet  us go and burn them up.\" That is what they want\r\n\r\n- riots,  trouble - just like school  kids.  Any  time\r\n\r\nthey  want to have trouble - and I notice one  thing.\r\n\r\nSir; any time there is going to be trouble, anything\r\n\r\ninvolving  violence, the leaders of the Barisan  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  front. A couple of months ago,  a  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman  led demonstrators. Mr Chan Sun Wing operated\r\n\r\nthe  whole  show  from the safety of this  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThey allowed pregnant women to risk their lives  and\r\n\r\nlimbs.  Fortunately, Sir, there cannot  be  pregnant\r\n\r\nmen, so I am quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure  these  people are not going to be in  trouble.\r\n\r\nBut  these Barisan people, the Communists, let  them\r\n\r\nrealise  this. The days are over when they can  fool\r\n\r\nthe  people. They know what the Communists stand for\r\n\r\nand  what the Barisan stand for. They know they  are\r\n\r\nout  for  mischief. They know they  want  to  create\r\n\r\ntrouble,  chaos, violence in this country  and  they\r\n\r\nknow  today,  after the last three or four  days  of\r\n\r\ndebate,  that these gentlemen are out for even  more\r\n\r\nserious trouble, to create more serious consequences\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore by playing around with foreign powers\r\n\r\nwho  have made it quite clear that they are  out  to\r\n\r\ndestroy this country. Because of that, they want  to\r\n\r\ncreate  this  atmosphere  of  tension.  Nothing  has\r\n\r\nhappened, Sir. They have made speeches for the  last\r\n\r\nfour  days. I am told, Sir, that even, the newspaper\r\n\r\nreaders  are  getting fed up of reading  these  long\r\n\r\nchunks.

As the Minister  for  Labour  has\r\n\r\nindicated,  their attitude is like  that  of  a  cat\r\n\r\nwhich  is moaning for a mouse. What they are  really\r\n\r\ninterested  in is to find some issue with  which  to\r\n\r\nwork  up the feelings of the people and create  some\r\n\r\ntension,   especially  in  view  of  the  particular\r\n\r\npolitical objective that they have at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that as far as both\r\n\r\nthe   blood   debt  and  the  memorial  issues   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  leave  them to the Government which  have  been\r\n\r\npursuing  them fairly effectively, consistently  and\r\n\r\nsincerely for quite some time.

On this matter, the Government has said  that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis created a lot of trouble during\r\n\r\nthe  mass  rally.  They have also alleged  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and their trade  unions  tried  to\r\n\r\nwreck  the rally. Who were actually responsible  for\r\n\r\ndisturbing  the order of the rally? I would  say  it\r\n\r\nwas the P.A.P. who were afraid of the success of the\r\n\r\nrally.  If the rally had been successful, the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  would have wanted the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  the  matter  of the blood  debt  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Japan, because this is a matter  which\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore cannot forget.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nfact,  because of the Japanese atrocities that  were\r\n\r\ncommitted  here  in the last war.  The  people  here\r\n\r\ndemanded retribution for the atrocities committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. indulged in white terror to frighten\r\n\r\nthe  people away and they tried to make use  of  the\r\n\r\nrally  for  their own purposes. They have  therefore\r\n\r\nshifted the blame for the disturbances that occurred\r\n\r\nduring  the  rally on to the Barisan Sosialis.  This\r\n\r\nhas always been the practice of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what happened at the rally? 120.000 people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  passed  a  resolution  to  ask  Japan  to\r\n\r\ncompensate  for  the blood debt.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour has just now said that this is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter   within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  know that in certain fields the  powers\r\n\r\nhave  been  handed  over to the Central  Government.\r\n\r\nThen  why  are  the P.A.P.

W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have had occasion yesterday and\r\n\r\ntoday to ask Members to refrain from making personal\r\n\r\nremarks.  The Parliamentary Secretary just mentioned\r\n\r\nCharlie  Chaplin and before he goes  on  further,  I\r\n\r\nmust stop him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot  alleging  that any Member of the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nlike  Charlie  Chaplin.  I  am  merely  saying  that\r\n\r\nCharlie Chaplin has ways which are humorous  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  tickled  by  the  way  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition have put their case to this House. If  we\r\n\r\nstudy  carefully the speeches of the Members of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition on this subject, there are two  or  three\r\n\r\nmain  points they have dwelt on. They have tried  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  main part, to replace the part played  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers  of  Commerce  of  Singapore,  because\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  above  18  years  of  age  can  be\r\n\r\nsensitive   about  the  atrocities   and   cruelties\r\n\r\ncommitted  by  the Japanese during the  three  years\r\n\r\nthey  occupied this country. The people who suffered\r\n\r\nunder the Japanese are now advanced in age and  they\r\n\r\nfully  supported  the  Government  during  the  last\r\n\r\nelection. But those youths who are below the age  of\r\n\r\neighteen  and who concern themselves only  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of Chinese education want to remind  their\r\n\r\nelders  of  the  atrocities of  the  Japanese.  This\r\n\r\nmatter  is  brought  up again while  we  are  facing\r\n\r\nconfrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not even four months now since the rally took place on 25th August. A mother needs nine months before she can give birth to a baby. A baby that is only conceived in four months is still-born. So it is too early for the Opposition Members to challenge the Government on the action to be\r\n\r\ntaken  by them. They bring up this question so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Malaysia will be faced with worse\r\n\r\nproblems  in  the midst of confrontation.  They  are\r\n\r\nmerely  instigating us to arouse  people's  feelings\r\n\r\nand  to worsen the effects of confrontation on  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  If  I remember correctly, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines has challenged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government to say what they have done.  We  are\r\n\r\nagainst  not only the Japanese who were our enemies,\r\n\r\nbut  we are more against all those who wish to bring\r\n\r\nsuffering to the people. These are our real enemies,\r\n\r\neven  if  they are Communists. It is their  ideology\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  against. We know their tactics.  They\r\n\r\nwill  use any possible opportunity to advance  their\r\n\r\ncause,  to bring about the downfall of our  economy.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  ruses they employ to aggravate  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier the Member for Thomson talked about the Prime Minister during the rally and one clear point which strikes me is that we should not be foolhardy in whatever we do. If we retaliate in a foolhardy manner, it will bring about our own ruin. We must negotiate and continue to negotiate\r\n\r\nuntil fruitful results are achieved. The way they go\r\n\r\nabout  it is to aggravate the confrontation. We  and\r\n\r\nthe  four Chambers of Commerce are together  in  our\r\n\r\nefforts to forward the same demand. We can read this\r\n\r\nfrom the papers and the matter of blood debt is  now\r\n\r\nin  the  hands  of  the Central  Government.  As  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Culture, has  said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  we can foresee what the Barisan intend to  say\r\n\r\nor  do.  They are merely trying to make use of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to aggravate matters. I see these people\r\n\r\nas  true  patriots  who hate atrocities!  If  it  is\r\n\r\nwithin  my  means,  I  would  ask  the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  to  put  up their statues  there  as  true\r\n\r\npatriots.  The  matter is now in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nChambers of Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They bring up this question in order to confuse\r\n\r\nthe  people. Are they truly the people who love this\r\n\r\ncountry?  We are now facing confrontation  and  they\r\n\r\nrequest   the  Government  to  bring  about  another\r\n\r\nconfrontation  with Japan. Is this true  patriotism?\r\n\r\nThe  loyalty  of  any  patriot is  towards  his  own\r\n\r\ncountry  and  for  the welfare of  his  country.  We\r\n\r\nshould adjust ourselves to different situations. We\r\n\r\nmust  be  loyal  to  the country  of  which  we  are\r\n\r\ncitizens. The Opposition claim that they are sincere\r\n\r\nin their opposition.

We have been playing music  to\r\n\r\ncows  who never appreciate good music! We have  been\r\n\r\nexplaining again and again, and they still  fail  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already said that the amount of $375,000\r\n\r\nhas  nothing  to do with the blood  debt.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ncontribution  from the Government side  towards  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  the memorial. Whether  blood  debt  is\r\n\r\nforthcoming or not this amount has to be  shouldered\r\n\r\nby  the  Government. They now say that we are trying\r\n\r\nto  make use of the public funds thus causing people\r\n\r\nto  forget about the blood debt. From their talk, we\r\n\r\ncan  see that they fail completely to understand the\r\n\r\nproblem  and the present situation. As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, we are using this fund for the construction of\r\n\r\nthe  memorial,  but before the negotiations  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of atonement are finalised, we just do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  much  we are going to  get,  but  we  can\r\n\r\npromise  them that whenever the money  is  paid,  we\r\n\r\nshall  make use of it for social uses. They  can  go\r\n\r\nand   ask   the   Chambers   of   Commerce   whether\r\n\r\nnegotiations are now under way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  a matter of fact, this question of atonement has\r\n\r\nbeen  raised by the Chambers of Commerce and not  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government  in  the  first  place,   but   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  assisting in the  matter.  So  they\r\n\r\ncannot say the Government are fully responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe matter. They are talking nonsense all along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the leaders of the Chambers of\r\n\r\nCommerce  in  carrying  out this  work  will  surely\r\n\r\nachieve something finally, and we believe that  they\r\n\r\nare  capable  of  achieving something  and  even  in\r\n\r\npersuading  and  getting the Central  Government  to\r\n\r\nsolve  this matter as early as possible. We  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  leaders of the Chambers of  Commerce  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of settling this matter to the satisfaction\r\n\r\nof  everybody, particularly those relatives  of  the\r\n\r\nvictims during the Japanese Occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Paya Lebar has said\r\n\r\nsomething to the effect that the Prime Minister  was\r\n\r\nnot  welcomed  at  the  mass rally  because  he  was\r\n\r\ntalking something different and not in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  of the meeting. But I want to  ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether  they  knew  that  the  Prime  Minister  was\r\n\r\ninvited by the sponsors of the rally to speak at the\r\n\r\nrally.  I  want to ask them whether they  know  that\r\n\r\nsome members of the Barisan Sosialis attempted to go\r\n\r\nup  to  the stage to speak, but were stopped by  the\r\n\r\nsponsors. Actually they wished very much to go up to\r\n\r\nthe  stage  to  speak, but they were not  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity.  So they say that the grapes  are  sour\r\n\r\nand   that   the  Prime  Minister  was  talking   on\r\n\r\nirrelevant matters at the rally and that was why the\r\n\r\ncrowd booed him down. This is just like saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  grapes  are sour. This kind of talk is  totally\r\n\r\nirrational and meaningless. They also say there  was\r\n\r\nnothing wrong in attending the mass rally. It is not\r\n\r\na  crime to attend this mass rally. I say there  was\r\n\r\nnothing wrong at all. In fact, it was the Government\r\n\r\nwho  assisted in the organisation of the rally. They\r\n\r\ngave radio and television facilities to the sponsors\r\n\r\nto enable them to appeal to the people to attend the\r\n\r\nrally.  In  fact, the Government also provided  free\r\n\r\nbus  rides to the people. Now, these are the  grapes\r\n\r\nwe  gave  to the people. But because they could  not\r\n\r\nenjoy them, they say they are sour. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas work supposed to be done by the sponsors, and we\r\n\r\nwere  helping them on the other side. Now  the  work\r\n\r\nhas  been  taken over by the Central Government  and\r\n\r\nthe Chambers of Commerce. Of course, we will get  in\r\n\r\ntouch with the Central Government with regard to the\r\n\r\nnegotiations to be initiated. All that  we  did  and\r\n\r\nwere required to do was to help in the rally and  in\r\n\r\nits  organisation. We said that we had sent  members\r\n\r\nof  the  Work Brigade to paste posters and  to  make\r\n\r\nappeals  to  members  of the public  to  attend  the\r\n\r\nrally.  Now,  have they done anything to  this  end?\r\n\r\nHave  they  helped in getting more people to  attend\r\n\r\nthe  rally? We helped in all ways in order to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the mass rally would actually and truly reflect\r\n\r\nthe  will and wishes of the people. But instead  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis tried to sabotage the rally.  They\r\n\r\ncarted loads of workers and other Barisan members to\r\n\r\nboo down the Prime Minister at the rally. Because we\r\n\r\nknew  what they were going to do, what they were  up\r\n\r\nto,  we had some police and some members of the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade to maintain order there. They put up posters\r\n\r\nwith  anti-Malaysia slogans and other slogans having\r\n\r\nanti-merger meaning. We were all there to talk about\r\n\r\nthe  blood  debt and the atrocities of the Japanese,\r\n\r\nbut  they  were  there  to talk  about  their  anti-Malaysia and anti-merger sentiments. It is they  who\r\n\r\nbrought  irrelevant and extraneous  matters  to  the\r\n\r\nmass rally, and not we. [Laughter] What is there  to\r\n\r\nlaugh  at? I do not have to consult anybody  in  the\r\n\r\nuse  of Chinese idioms. I know what idiom I am using\r\n\r\nand I know its meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

So\r\n\r\nif anybody can make use of this matter for political\r\n\r\npurposes,  he  will  do  it.

Mr  Ng  Aik\r\n\r\nHuan  told them that they were not welcome. If  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  know more, they can go and see  him.

There was no need for  us  to  register\r\n\r\nourselves.

Why\r\n\r\nshould  there  be such a memorial? This  is  because\r\n\r\nduring the Second World War the Japanese murdered  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  civilians here. In the past few months  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore have pressed for  compensation\r\n\r\nfor this blood debt, and after some time of struggle\r\n\r\n- this struggle is a popular struggle - the Government\r\n\r\nhave  also  pressed  for the  claim.  As  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers, we have the right and the responsibility to\r\n\r\ncontribute our bit, and the reason why we raise this\r\n\r\nquestion  is  to urge the Government  to  fight  for\r\n\r\ncompensation, But the explanation of the Minister is\r\n\r\nnot  satisfactory and has caused me much  doubt.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government say that they want to press for  the\r\n\r\nclaim, there will not be such a heated debate today,\r\n\r\nbut  they seem not to be interested in fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe compensation. Instead, they make use of this  to\r\n\r\nfurther their political ends.

This\r\n\r\nreminds  me  that  many Members  have  in  the  past\r\n\r\ncondemned the Japanese atrocities and the Government\r\n\r\npro-Japanese  attitude.  I  have  merely  given   an\r\n\r\naccount  of what took place in the past. I  seem  to\r\n\r\nremember  that Mr Marshall raised a question  about\r\n\r\nthe   Japanese  advertising  tower.  He   said   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  something to  hide  about  it.  The\r\n\r\nengineer  originally did not permit this  particular\r\n\r\nfirm  to  put  up  the advertising  tower,  but  his\r\n\r\ndecision was overruled by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an oil refinery beside the Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nPower Station which is owned by Japanese.

We are merely  voicing\r\n\r\nthe feelings of the relatives of the victims. We are\r\n\r\nnot  trying to play politics in this matter. We  did\r\n\r\nnot, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  have  said, attempt to speak at the  rally.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  mass  following and among us  many  of  our\r\n\r\nrelatives  were  also victims of the  Japanese.  The\r\n\r\nbrother  of Miss Fung Yin Ching was also  killed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese. So the question of the blood debt has\r\n\r\ntouched  us  very  much. Why should  you  create  an\r\n\r\natmosphere   of  terror,  spreading   rumours,   and\r\n\r\nmobilising  the police and military to  terrify  the\r\n\r\npeople? You were trying to intimidate the people and\r\n\r\nprevent  them from attending the rally. I urge  them\r\n\r\nto  go and attend the rally in spite of Government's\r\n\r\nattempt  to  intimidate  them.  It  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wanted  to use this  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and the Left-wing  organisations.\r\n\r\nThe  rally  on  that  night was properly  organised.\r\n\r\nThere was no trouble. The Chairman of the rally also\r\n\r\nspoke  highly  of  the rally.

I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  blood  debt  will create another  confrontation\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and  Japan.  We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunist   Barisan  always  take  the  opportunity,\r\n\r\nwhenever  they  can, to exploit  the  situation.  If\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches are to be published  in  the  papers\r\n\r\ntomorrow. I think the Internal Security forces  will\r\n\r\nreinforce   their  police  to  guard  the   Japanese\r\n\r\nEmbassy.

I want to ask Members across the Floor whether\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  teach the highest authority  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  organisation, that is, the Chinese  Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce, the way how to insist on the  Japanese\r\n\r\npaying  the  blood debt. I think they  are  old  and\r\n\r\nexperienced enough to deal with this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with the mass rally, all the\r\n\r\nheckling, and how the Prime Minister was booed  when\r\n\r\nhe  stood up to speak. As I have said just  now,  at\r\n\r\nevery opportunity the Communists try to exploit  and\r\n\r\nto  intimidate. They tried to boo the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nat  the  mass  rally, but when the  spotlights  were\r\n\r\ndirected at them, this group of white\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshirts  and blue trousers - well organised  Communist\r\n\r\npuppets   - disappeared.

They have talked eloquently and at  length.\r\n\r\nThey  were  describing how the people  had  suffered\r\n\r\nduring  the Japanese Occupation. To sum  up,  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  political talk. The Member for Jalan Kayu  has\r\n\r\nsaid just now, because the Government are pro-Japan,\r\n\r\ntherefore they are now not trying to press the claim\r\n\r\nfor   blood  debt.  I  feel  that  today  the  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple  is to be on good and friendly terms  with\r\n\r\npeople  all over the world. Pressing for blood  debt\r\n\r\nis  another matter. It does not mean that because we\r\n\r\nwant  to press for blood debt, we should not  be  on\r\n\r\nfriendly  terms with others. This matter  cannot  be\r\n\r\nresolved   just  by  shouting  slogans   or   making\r\n\r\naccusations  or attacking others. We should  try  to\r\n\r\nresolve the matter reasonably and in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Barisan Members opposite us.\r\n\r\nThey  have just admitted that the claim for  payment\r\n\r\nof blood debt is a matter that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerns all the people of Singapore.

It will only enable foreign countries to  see\r\n\r\nthat  among  us there are traitors. The  mass  rally\r\n\r\norganised  by the Chambers of Commerce  and  various\r\n\r\nother   civic   organisations  was   destroyed   and\r\n\r\nsabotaged  by such people as those sitting opposite.\r\n\r\nCan  they  deny  this? All their  eloquent  talk  is\r\n\r\nnothing   but  propaganda.  There  is   nothing   of\r\n\r\nsubstance. They should not think that by their  talk\r\n\r\nthey  can  deceive the people.

Members  of  seven \r\n\r\ntrade  unions  have been arrested and  trade  unions \r\n\r\nhave   been  banned.  The  Ministry  is  not   truly \r\n\r\nconcerned with the welfare of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now there was mention of the blood debt issue\r\n\r\nand the mass rally organised in conjunction with it.\r\n\r\nCertain  trade union members attended the rally  and\r\n\r\nit  resulted in their being arrested and  the  seven\r\n\r\nunions  being banned. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment have cancelled the registration of  these\r\n\r\nseven trade unions. On what grounds? I would like to\r\n\r\ngive  the  reasons for their action in deregistering\r\n\r\nthe  seven trade unions. This action of the Ministry\r\n\r\nwas  carried out only two days after the blood  debt\r\n\r\nmass  rally,  when the Secretary of  State  for  the\r\n\r\nColonies, Mr Duncan Sandys, all of a sudden arrived\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  There seemed to be  some  connection\r\n\r\nbetween  the  banning of the trade  unions  and  his\r\n\r\narrival.  The  Registrar of Trade  Unions  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement saying that certain trade unions which had\r\n\r\ntaken  part  in the rally organised by  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce on the 25th of  August,  1963,\r\n\r\nacted incompatibly with the rules and regulations of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  had  carried  out  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nactivities.  On  account of this, the  seven  unions\r\n\r\nwere  banned. Now, this is very ridiculous.  And  it\r\n\r\nalso  goes  to  show how the P.A.P. Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen using this pretext to deal with workers who are\r\n\r\nnow  in  favour of the P.A.P. and who do not support\r\n\r\nP.A.P. policies. All those trade unions which do not\r\n\r\nsupport the policies of the P.A.P. are banned.  This\r\n\r\nis  very  clear to all. That is the way  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  treat trade unions and the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe workers. This is the only achievement the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment can claim in its labour policy.  How  can\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. claim credit for their services  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  when in fact they are serving the  interest\r\n\r\nof foreign capitalists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers had gone on strike because of asking for\r\n\r\nbetter working conditions and better wages, yet  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the  case of the Naval  Base  strike\r\n\r\nturned round and said that that strike was illegal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  so they stepped in. Mr Speaker, during the few\r\n\r\ndays  of the strike, why did the Ministry of  Labour\r\n\r\nnot  tell the Naval Base Union that their strike was\r\n\r\nnot  legal? Why should the Registrar wait for  about\r\n\r\none  month? He mobilised police and troops to  break\r\n\r\nup  the strike. For one month all the workers of the\r\n\r\nNaval Base Workers Union had been solidly behind the\r\n\r\nstrike.  When  the P.A.P. Government  saw  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were very strong in their concerted action,\r\n\r\nthey  resorted  to action to break  up  the  strike,\r\n\r\ncalling  it  an  illegal strike. Even  the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Devan Nair, had sometime ago  said  that\r\n\r\nthe strike was justifiable and that it was a genuine\r\n\r\ntrade dispute. In the end the P.A.P., in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith the authorities of the Naval Base, broke up the\r\n\r\nstrike. It shows that the P.A.P. Government had been\r\n\r\nconsorting with the British imperialists to break up\r\n\r\nthe  Naval Base strike. The workers there will never\r\n\r\nforget  the P.A.P.'s collaboration with the  foreign\r\n\r\nimperialists. I would also go further and  show  how\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. broke up the strike of the  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nUnion.  The P.A.P. used Singapore police and Federal\r\n\r\npolice to beat up striking workers in order to break\r\n\r\nup  the strike. Singapore has autonomy in labour. In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the Naval Base workers'  strike,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, with the abetment of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment, broke up the strike. Are the workers not\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel  of  the people  of  Singapore?  I\r\n\r\nremember  that the Prime Minister said sometime  ago\r\n\r\nthat certain powers will have to be in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe Central Government, but in respect of labour and\r\n\r\neducation Singapore still has its autonomy. Where is\r\n\r\nthe  autonomy  in labour if the Federal  police  are\r\n\r\nused  to  break up the Naval Base strike?  When  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government can send troops to break  up  the\r\n\r\nstrike,  so-called autonomy in labour  is  really  a\r\n\r\nhumbug. The police, maintained by our public  funds,\r\n\r\nhave  been  used to help foreign powers and  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests  and  to help the Federal police  to  come\r\n\r\nhere and break up the strike against the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. What kind of labour autonomy is  this?\r\n\r\nIs it not humbug?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Besar always mentions the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  matter is entirely within the jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  because  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  labour, so that there is  no  need  to\r\n\r\nshift  the  blame on to the Central Government.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jalan Besar dares to  talk  in  such  a\r\n\r\ntrend. I hope he will not interfere further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me again come back to the Naval Base\r\n\r\nworkers' strike. The police have been maintained  by\r\n\r\nus  and  we have also contributed to the maintenance\r\n\r\nof  the  police in the Federation, and yet they  are\r\n\r\nbeing  used  to  help foreigners,  to  help  foreign\r\n\r\npowers  to  maintain  their  interests  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers. This is not wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch upon the general strike on the\r\n\r\n8th  and 9th of October. How did it happen?  I  will\r\n\r\ngive  details  as to how it all arose.  On  the  8th\r\n\r\nOctober the general strike called for resulted  from\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  barbarous action  in  cancelling  the\r\n\r\nregistration of trade unions of workers  which  look\r\n\r\nafter    their    interest.   Totally   disregarding\r\n\r\neverything,  the P.A.P. Government  took  action  to\r\n\r\ncancel the registration of these trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these trade unions and the workers belonging\r\n\r\nto  them,  for  the sake of their organisations  and\r\n\r\nalso  in  order  that  their  future  interests  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  might  be looked after, had  come  out  to\r\n\r\nprotest against the unreasonable and barbaric action\r\n\r\nof  de-registration. They had called for  a  general\r\n\r\nstrike  also  on account of their rights  and  their\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the Singapore Government deal with this\r\n\r\ngeneral strike? It adopted the tactic of breaking up\r\n\r\nthe  general  strike by alleging that  it  had  been\r\n\r\ninstigated  by the Communists. But the workers  knew\r\n\r\nvery  clearly.  How  could  they  allow  their   own\r\n\r\norganisations to be broken up? Of course, they would\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  let the Government ban their  unions.\r\n\r\nThese workers are intelligent people. They would not\r\n\r\nallow  the  Government to do such  things.  Had  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  taken action in banning  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  arresting the workers, they  would  not\r\n\r\nhave taken such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction,  and  there would not have been any  general\r\n\r\nstrike.  This is another instance to show  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have been using the police to break  up  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  strike of the workers.  And  the  police\r\n\r\nhave  resorted  to  atrocities  in  heating  up  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  There were four women workers in Lorong  3\r\n\r\nwho  were beaten up. This is in the records  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Department. You cannot deny it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Education has alleged\r\n\r\nthat  their  strike was illegal. Does he  mean  that\r\n\r\nonly when the workers supported the interests of the\r\n\r\nforeign  imperialists and capitalists and  supported\r\n\r\nthe authority of the Naval Base, would the strike be\r\n\r\nlegal? [Interruption] I remind the Government  Backbenchers not to interfere. I would urge them to talk\r\n\r\nreasonably.   On   the  8th  and  9th   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfantastically made use of the police to break up the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  strike of the workers. This has  left  a\r\n\r\nvery  deep impression on the minds of the people  as\r\n\r\nto the nature and the true colours of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the P.A.P.'s labour policies\r\n\r\nin  regard to workers. Firstly, what the P.A.P. want\r\n\r\nto  do is that all those trade unions which are  not\r\n\r\nunder  the  control of the P.A.P. will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nbanned. That is the first thing the P.A.P. would  do\r\n\r\nin  its labour policy. All non-P.A.P. unions will be\r\n\r\ndissolved. Secondly, through the Government's rights\r\n\r\nand  powers,  the P.A.P. are recruiting stooges  and\r\n\r\nlackeys  to  create trouble and to  control  certain\r\n\r\nunions  in order to take them over. In this way  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. and  the Singapore Manual  and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers  Union were created. From this  we  can  see\r\n\r\nwhat  the  P.A.P. have been doing in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nlabour and treatment of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to make is that in the\r\n\r\nfield of social welfare, the welfare of the workers,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government have always been on the  side\r\n\r\nof  foreign  capitalists. The P.A.P. have  construed\r\n\r\nany  trade  dispute by trade unions not under  their\r\n\r\ncontrol  to  be Communist-inspired. The  Naval  Base\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union strike is a very glaring example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Minister   for  Labour  has  told   us   that \r\n\r\nlegislation will be introduced in  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis House to amend the Trade Unions Ordinance and\r\n\r\nwe will definitely oppose its passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Do  not  behave like the P.A.P. which  are\r\n\r\nalways  arrogant. Do not try to push matters to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government on the face of it  and  secretly\r\n\r\ntry to jeopardise the interests of the workers. This\r\n\r\nis very ungentlemanly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from the general strike on the 8th\r\n\r\nand  9th  of  October, one can see that the  workers \r\n\r\nwent on strike to safeguard their own interests  and \r\n\r\nto  safeguard and defend their own unions. There  is \r\n\r\nno  smoke  without fire. If there is no fire,  there \r\n\r\nwill  not be any smoke. If there had been no  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbanning the unions, there would not have been such a\r\n\r\nstrike. This is very clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government have done something against\r\n\r\ntheir  interests.  So the workers should  not  allow\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  be  slaughtered  in  any   way   the\r\n\r\nslaughterer pleases. The workers have their  brains.\r\n\r\nThey   will   never  allow  themselves   and   their\r\n\r\norganisations to be jeopardised. They  must  have  a\r\n\r\nreaction  towards Government actions. They  are  not\r\n\r\nlike  the P.A.P. which are always running away  from\r\n\r\nfacts.  So the workers stood up in defence of  their\r\n\r\norganisation and they struggled for their interests.\r\n\r\nBut  the Government, thinking that these unions were\r\n\r\nnot under the P.A.P. control and were not likely  to\r\n\r\nbe led by the nose by the P.A.P., resorted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  various ways and means of dealing with them, and\r\n\r\nso  they  found  the solution in Communism,  dubbing\r\n\r\nthese organisations as Communist and ban them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many representatives and\r\n\r\nleaders  of the trade unions in Singapore  who  were \r\n\r\narrested  after having been called Communists.  This \r\n\r\nis  a fact known to everybody. And so we oppose  and \r\n\r\nprotest  very strongly against all the actions  that \r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have taken against the workers and their\r\n\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am tabling this amendment. I move it\r\n\r\nin  order  to  air  my views on these  matters.  The\r\n\r\nactions  of  the P.A.P. will always  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people. The people will never  forget\r\n\r\ntheir  pro-colonial actions which are at the expense\r\n\r\nof  the  workers.  They  will  always  remember  the\r\n\r\nbarbaric  and  repressive actions which  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntook  against the workers, indeed, the workers  will\r\n\r\nnever forgive the P.A.P. for behaving in this manner\r\n\r\nand bringing about greater misery among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  just now the Member for  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nsaid  that the P.A.P. Government used the police  to\r\n\r\nbreak  up  strikes  and  so on.  We  know  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union  were\r\n\r\nsometimes involved with the police in their strikes.\r\n\r\nWe  know that before Malaysia took place, the police\r\n\r\nwere  under the control of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\nBut   today  the  control  has  gone  over  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Now, at that time, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nalso  saw  that  each  time a Minister  passed,  the\r\n\r\npolice  saluted them. But nowadays, sometimes  there\r\n\r\nis  no  salute from the police. This is clear  proof - even if Charlie Chaplin were here, Mr Speaker,  he\r\n\r\nwould  know  this  - of a clear-cut policy  that  the\r\n\r\npolice are under the control of the Federation.

There is no\r\n\r\nneed  for me to mention their names. Members of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Committee  of  the  National  Trade   Union\r\n\r\nCongress are not all members of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.

Let us have  no\r\n\r\nrepetition of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Sir, I mean the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar.  We  have not always agreed, and  that  is  a\r\n\r\nfact. We can prove it. We have criticised the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  whenever it is wrong. But I  have  never\r\n\r\nseen a Barisan union - when I say a Barisan union.  I\r\n\r\nmean   the  affiliates  of  the  ex-S.A.T.U. union\r\n\r\n- criticising  the Barisan Sosialis,  even  in  their\r\n\r\nlast political strike of two days. Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. cannot  criticise  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are birds of the same  feather.  They\r\n\r\nknow  what  it  means.  Out  of  the  11  candidates\r\n\r\nselected   by  the  National  Trade  Union  Congress\r\n\r\nstanding for election in the last general elections,\r\n\r\nnine  were  elected.  I do not  think  the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nunions  can  boast  of that. Surely  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who voted these nine trade union  leaders\r\n\r\ninto the Assembly know what they have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  if  the  S.A.T.U. unions think they  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the masses, which the N.T.U.C. now claims\r\n\r\nto  be  over 100,000, it reminds me of an old  story\r\n\r\nwhich  I  read when I was a little boy. It  is  Snow\r\n\r\nWhite  and the Seven Dwarfs. But now it looks as  if\r\n\r\nSnow  White  is missing. Even now, Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. is helping to draft out the claims  at  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Research Unit against its employers. I  want\r\n\r\nto  state  quite frankly here that the N.T.U.C.,  as\r\n\r\nhas  been  claimed by the Member for Paya Lebar,  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  P.A.P. N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C. stands for  its\r\n\r\nrights. It will criticise the Government at any time\r\n\r\nif  the  Government  is  proved  wrong,  unlike  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. which claims that it is anti-P.A.P. It  can\r\n\r\nbe anti-P.A.P. But I think, as far as the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they are pro-Communist S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the Back Benches of the Government are very fond of talking\r\n\r\nabout  people like Charlie Chaplin and the  rest  of\r\n\r\nit.  Sometimes  they refer to us as Charlie  Chaplin\r\n\r\nand  Communists. Now, if we were to indulge  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  tactics when dealing with them, then we  could\r\n\r\ncall him `the fatty Member of the House'. But we are\r\n\r\nnot  doing  it because we do not want to insult  the\r\n\r\ndignity  of the House. We just do not want  to  call\r\n\r\nhim names. This will be an insult to the dignity  of\r\n\r\nthe  House.  We are not like them. All that  he  has\r\n\r\nspoken  just  now boils down to this,  namely,  that\r\n\r\neven  workers of their unions clash with the  police\r\n\r\nat  times. Now, this shows that we are right when we\r\n\r\npointed out that before Malaysia autonomy in labour,\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. was boasting about, is meaningless.\r\n\r\nWe  pointed out long ago that the so-called autonomy\r\n\r\nin labour was but a humbug and a fraud. We have been\r\n\r\npointing  out  all along that as long  as  political\r\n\r\npower  is  in  the hands of the Central  Government,\r\n\r\nthen  the  Central Government can, in  the  name  of\r\n\r\nsecurity,  take action against all those people  who\r\n\r\nare  working  for the interest of the workers.  This\r\n\r\npoint is fully borne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout by the speech made by the Member just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to point out again that the workers have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to fight for their own interest.  In  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  they  are  entitled to take  strike  actions\r\n\r\nwhich  are  wholly legitimate. As my  colleague  has\r\n\r\npointed out, seven unions were banned because  their\r\n\r\nmembers   went  on  strike  to  defend   their   own\r\n\r\norganisations.   The   Naval   Base    strike    was\r\n\r\nprecipitated because the workers wanted to  ask  for\r\n\r\nwage  increases. That was very legitimate action  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the workers. But the P.A.P., because the\r\n\r\nunions  who  went  on strike do not  belong  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. group, made use of the legal provisions  and\r\n\r\nother  illegal means as well against  them.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, the police were used. Some members of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force even went to the extent of  assaulting\r\n\r\nthe  workers on strike. After all this,  they  would\r\n\r\nsay  \"Oh, police action is the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government, and it has got  nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  P.A.P. now.\" Who will believe  all  this\r\n\r\nnonsense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to tell you that not long ago the reason why a general strike was called by the seven now defunct trade unions was that the workers wanted to safeguard their own organisations. The next day of the strike, the P.A.P. realised that the strike was quite successful and so they said the\r\n\r\nstrike was illegal. So they went into collusion  and\r\n\r\ncollaboration  with the Central Government  to  take\r\n\r\npolice  action  against  the  workers  who  went  on\r\n\r\nstrike. In Lorong 3, Geylang, I think, there was  an\r\n\r\nincident  in  which  members  of  the  Police  Force\r\n\r\nassaulted members of the unions on strike. This took\r\n\r\nplace  in a rubber factory in Lorong 3. The  factory\r\n\r\nis  known  as the Yam Hong Rubber Factory.  All  the\r\n\r\nworkers in this factory - they number about 200 - went\r\n\r\non  strike. Because the P.A.P. Government called the\r\n\r\nstrike illegal, there were a lot of policemen around\r\n\r\nthe  place  on  the second day of  the  strike  with\r\n\r\ninstructions to disperse the workers on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think, Mr Speaker, you will appreciate that when\r\n\r\na  person or an organisation takes certain action to\r\n\r\ndefend  itself  and such action is interfered  with,\r\n\r\nthen there will be a reaction. Of course, there will\r\n\r\nbe  resistance as well. So what happened? The police\r\n\r\ntook  action to disperse the strikers. In the course\r\n\r\nof  such dispersal, some workers sustained injuries.\r\n\r\nOthers  were assaulted by the police. Some  of  them\r\n\r\nwere  even  sent to the General Hospital. These  are\r\n\r\nfacts which nobody can ever deny. If you really want\r\n\r\nto  know  these facts, you can make an investigation\r\n\r\nin  the  General Hospital. Now, this action  against\r\n\r\nthe workers -why should there be such an action?  Do\r\n\r\nyou  call the strike illegal? No, you cannot because\r\n\r\nthey  went  on  strike  in  defence  of  their   own\r\n\r\norganisation.  In the history of trade  unionism  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there are many instances of such strikes.\r\n\r\nBut  what, is  the  result in connection  with  the\r\n\r\nrecent strike? Now, because the newspapers are under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of the P.A.P. mud because  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  control over the radio as well, there  was  no\r\n\r\nnews  concerning the assault. On the other hand,  it\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that  it  was the  workers  who  were\r\n\r\nrioting,  by their surrounding the riot  squads  and\r\n\r\nthe  red  vans. Now, Mr Speaker, if you were  there\r\n\r\nand  if  you were one of the strikers, I  think  you\r\n\r\nwould  have a very strange feeling in you.  This  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what  the PAP, arc doing  and  have  done\r\n\r\nagainst  workers  and unions which  do  not  support\r\n\r\nthem,  that  is, assault them first and  smear  them\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is more vicious than this action and\r\n\r\nbehaviour? All that they dare say is Communists  and\r\n\r\npro-Communists. They say so in this  Chamber  or  in\r\n\r\ntheir air-conditioned rooms, but they will never  go\r\n\r\nout  to say this publicly. And they will never  dare\r\n\r\nsay this even in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the  Prime Minister  has  said  that there are only 300 Communists in Singapore. We  know that  this  figure  comes from  the  Prime  Minister himself.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  because  the P.A.P. are against the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nmovement --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Singapore has gone  Red;\r\n\r\neverybody in Singapore who is against the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\na  Communist.  That is their argument.  If  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  does lot support the P.A.P., then it is  Red.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  unionists do not support  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthey  must be Red. For example, students who do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the  P.A.P.'s education policy  are  called\r\n\r\nCommunists. Similarly the term \"Communist\" has  been\r\n\r\napplied to many other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ministers or Government Backbenchers cannot\r\n\r\nquote  facts  to  refute our  arguments,  then  they\r\n\r\nalways resort to calling us Communists. It is  under\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances  that progressive  trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave  been  persecuted and oppressed and banned  one\r\n\r\nafter  another.  On the other hand,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhave  the cheek to turn round and say that they  are\r\n\r\npro-labour and are working for the interests of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  But how do they go about safeguarding  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  workers?  They  liquidate  trade\r\n\r\nunions  whose  leaders  do  not  agree  with   their\r\n\r\npolicies, and then organise trade unions which  they\r\n\r\nthink will support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, they even make use of the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment against the workers and progressive trade\r\n\r\nunions which do not support them.

I want to raise two\r\n\r\npoints. Firstly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  say  that S.A.T.U. is not truly representative\r\n\r\nof  the  workers'  unions. I  am  not  a  member  of\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U., but I feel that even as a non-member I can\r\n\r\neasily   find   out  whether  S.A.T.U. is   really\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  workers.  The  question   whether\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. is  truly representative  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nshould  not  be decided by those who oppose  it.  It\r\n\r\nshould be decided by members of unions belonging  to\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U.  Here is a fact - the two-day strike  action\r\n\r\nconducted by S.A.T.U. was a success. If S.A.T.U. did\r\n\r\nnot   represent  the  workers,  then  whom  did   it\r\n\r\nrepresent?  It is because it represents the  workers\r\n\r\nthat  the strike action was successful. That is  why\r\n\r\nthe  Government  said  that the  strike  action  was\r\n\r\nillegal so that they could ban the unions and arrest\r\n\r\ntheir leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears to me that\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition are beating  about  the\r\n\r\nbush.  They harp on the subject again and  again  as\r\n\r\nthough they alone have the liberty to speak in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. They are merely beating about the bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think the hon. Member is\r\n\r\nbeating about the bush. If he did, he was being  led\r\n\r\nthere by continual interruptions from the Government\r\n\r\nside.  If  Government Members were to  hear  him  in\r\n\r\nsilence, I think he will make a much better job than\r\n\r\nwhat he is doing now. Please proceed. Mr Young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  I  am trying to co-operate with  you,  but\r\n\r\nBackbenchers on the Government side are not  willing\r\n\r\nto co-operate with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that S.A.T.U. is not representative of\r\n\r\nthe  workers, there is no need for the P.A.P. to use\r\n\r\ntheir  State  organ to declare that S.A.T.U. is  an\r\n\r\nillegal  organisation.  Moreover,  if  it   is   not\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the workers, then it  will  die  a\r\n\r\nnatural death. Why should the Government ban it? Why\r\n\r\nnot  leave  it  alone? It is because the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nafraid  of  S.A.T.U.  It  is  because  S.A.T.U. is\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the workers. If S.A.T.U. continues\r\n\r\nto exist, the N.T.U.C. will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   able   to  expand  and  recruit  new   members.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  saw fit to ban  S.A.T.U.  This  is\r\n\r\ncommon sense. Nobody will believe that P.A.P. banned\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. because it is not representing the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, is the N.T.U.C. a P.A.P. union?\r\n\r\nNobody  believes that the N.TU.C. is  not  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunion.   Why  should  the  P.A.P. want  to   create\r\n\r\nfavourable conditions so as to allow the N.T.U.C. to\r\n\r\nexpand and to take over the members of unions  which\r\n\r\nhave  been banned by the Government? Why should  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. be  so concerned about the N.T.U.C.?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause the N.T.U.C. is the life-blood of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWithout  it, the P.A.P.'s deception of the so-called\r\n\r\ndemocratic   trade  union  movement  will   not   he\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the many struggles that followed, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave   created  opportunities  and  all   sorts   of\r\n\r\nconditions  to allow the N.T.U.C. to expand  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  other unions. As they are  selfish  and\r\n\r\nthey have a total disregard for justice, we dare not\r\n\r\nbelieve that the N.T.U.C. is not a P.A.P. union.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  so-called P.A.P.'s  pro-labour  policy\r\n\r\nwill  one day be exposed. There will come a day when\r\n\r\nthe  N.T.U.C. members will clearly see  through  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s pro-labour policy and will then see through\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it appears to me that the Barisan Sosialis  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  champion the cause of the  workers,  but\r\n\r\nactually they are betraying them. It is they who are\r\n\r\nresponsible for instigating the people to go against\r\n\r\nthe  law.  The simple reason is that they  want  the\r\n\r\npolice  to take action against the workers  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can blame the Government. This is a betrayal of\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Member speak a little away\r\n\r\nfrom the microphone? Do not speak too close to it. I\r\n\r\ncannot follow the translation because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis voice is too loud.

On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  they  are truly traitors. They  instigate\r\n\r\nthe workers to go against the law so that the police\r\n\r\nwill  take action and thereafter they can blame  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  They  are the people who  are  actually\r\n\r\nbehind all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the labour policy of the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ngood.  If  we  compare the labour  policy  that  was\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the Government of Tun Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nwith  that of the P.A.P., the labour situation under\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is healthier. Because the anti-national\r\n\r\nelements have broken away from the P.A.P., there  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  split among the workers. This is proof  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Members are not sincere in working  for\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers. They use the  workers\r\n\r\nfor  their  own  political  ends,  as  in  the  last\r\n\r\nelections   when  they  used  them  to  oppose   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  is  sheer  exploitation  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also instigated the workers to go against the\r\n\r\nGovernment in order to help Indonesia in its  policy\r\n\r\nof  confrontation.  We  can  see  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have carried out orders from the P.K.I. in\r\n\r\norder  to  wreck our country and Malaysia.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Barisan Sosialis want. They are against the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers and they are merely out  to\r\n\r\nfurther the interests of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member who spoke just now praised the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nlabour policy and compared it with the labour policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Lim Yew Hock Government. He said  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s labour policy is better. I think this trend\r\n\r\nof  talk has been used by the Prime Minister, and it\r\n\r\ntherefore does not do the hon. Member any credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to repeat what I have said just now.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Members  have said  that  S.A.T.U. and\r\n\r\ncertain  trade unions were banned because  they  had\r\n\r\nbeen  carrying out Communist activities  detrimental\r\n\r\nto the security of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState. But we can clearly see through this argument.\r\n\r\nUnder  what  circumstances were these  trade  unions\r\n\r\nbanned?  I  believe you can conclude that the  seven\r\n\r\ntrade   unions  were  banned  merely  because  their\r\n\r\nmembers  had  attended the mass rally in  connection\r\n\r\nwith  the blood debt. On the day following the  mass\r\n\r\nrally, these unions were given notice to explain why\r\n\r\nthey  should not be de-registered. Of course, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  to  explain. The Government  should\r\n\r\ngive reasons why these unions had to be banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister of Singapore and Tun Abdul\r\n\r\nRazak  had a secret meeting which resulted in  their \r\n\r\ntaking repressive action against the workers and the \r\n\r\ntrade unions. It is not because these unions did not \r\n\r\nreceive the support of the workers, or that they had \r\n\r\ncarried  out  illegal acts, or that  they  had  done\r\n\r\nanything  detrimental to the security of the  State.\r\n\r\nBut all this is deceitful talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have seen clearly what the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have done during all these years.  When  the\r\n\r\nworkers went on strike, the P.A.P. Government helped\r\n\r\nforeign  interests to break the strike. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  said that this is a matter  that  comes\r\n\r\nwithin  the  jurisdiction of the Central Government.\r\n\r\nLet  me  ask  him: where is our autonomy in  labour?\r\n\r\nThat  is  the basic question. Therefore,  we  should\r\n\r\nknow  the circumstances under which the trade unions\r\n\r\nwere  banned. The P.A.P. wanted all the trade unions\r\n\r\nto  come under their control and all the workers  to\r\n\r\ngo  over  to their side. In wanting to do  so,  they\r\n\r\ntook action to ban the trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person dares to criticise the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  kow-tow to them, he will be sacked.  If\r\n\r\nanybody  dares to criticise the Government, he  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely be arrested. Mr Speaker, there are  many\r\n\r\nmembers and representatives of the trade unions  who\r\n\r\nare  in  Changi  Prison and Outram Prison.  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\nofficials  were also detained in gaol. How  can  you\r\n\r\nblame  the Central Government? Were it not  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. sellout,  would the Central Government  have\r\n\r\ndared to take such action against the workers? It is\r\n\r\nonly  because  the  Lee  Kuan  Yew  Government  have\r\n\r\ncollaborated  with  the  imperialists  and  colonial\r\n\r\npower together\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  reactionary Central Government  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  interest and welfare have been suppressed.\r\n\r\nIf  the  workers go on strike, the P.A.P. say  that\r\n\r\nthey are Communists, and they arrest them under such\r\n\r\na  pretext. Where is the justification for that? The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour has said that Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\ncountry  which is enjoying the rule of law. If  that\r\n\r\nis  so,  why  should such action  be  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment? How is it that there are so many workers\r\n\r\nin  gaol? The Minister has also said that because of\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  law existing here, we have  not  been\r\n\r\narrested  and put in gaol and that we are given  the\r\n\r\nchance  to  speak here. I would ask this  then:  Why\r\n\r\nwere   the  workers  not  brought  to  Court?  Those\r\n\r\narrested were not brought to Court to be tried,  but\r\n\r\nthey  were sent to gaol. All those unions which  did\r\n\r\nnot  support  the  Government were banned.  And  all\r\n\r\nthose  members of the unions which did  not  support\r\n\r\nthe  Government  were arrested.  If  the  Government\r\n\r\naccuse  us  of  being Communists, then  they  should\r\n\r\nbring  us to Court. This is a challenge to  them.  I\r\n\r\nchallenge them to take action against us in Court if\r\n\r\nthey want to brand us as Communists. We are speaking\r\n\r\non  behalf of the people. We are representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  We  will still continue  our  struggle\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism and imperialism. We are not like\r\n\r\nthose people who hide under the table in the face of\r\n\r\nimperialist suppression. I would, therefore,  advise\r\n\r\nthe Government not to raise this Communist bogey.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  if the Minister for Culture  were  to\r\n\r\nrefrain  from the use of the term \"Communist bogey\",\r\n\r\nhe would not have any further argument to refute us.\r\n\r\nWe  have heard him for the last few years using  the\r\n\r\nword  \"Communist\", \"Communist\". To sum up,  all  his\r\n\r\narguments  are nothing but taking the anti-Communist\r\n\r\nline.  If he is a Minister worth his salt,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould  not have done such things. He is doing  this\r\n\r\nin  the hope of getting a medal from America as  one\r\n\r\nwho   is  an  anti-Communist  hero!  But  he  should\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the people know where justice  lies\r\n\r\nand who is right and who is wrong. [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Labour is right in  saying  that the judgment lies in the  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhands of the workers and the people.

In spite of what the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has said, the P.A.P. Government  have\r\n\r\ndone  things in a cleverer way than did Tun Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock.  It  has  taken  action against  the  workers'\r\n\r\norganisations.  Soon  after  their  victory  in  the\r\n\r\nelections,  the  P.A.P. took  action  against  many\r\n\r\nunions.  They have taken action against the workers.\r\n\r\nIs  this not the same action which the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nregime  and  the colonial masters took  against  the\r\n\r\nworkers?  We  have  experienced such  actions  being\r\n\r\ntaken  before. Now we are seeing such actions  being\r\n\r\nrepeated.  We  are  against the  P.A.P. today.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  are against the P.A.P. today. They are  the\r\n\r\nsame  workers  who  were against the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nregime.  They  are  also the same workers  who  were\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Japanese atrocities and  the  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters. They are the same workers. Now we  can  see\r\n\r\nwhether  the  P.A.P. are really  fighting  for  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the workers. I believe  that  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers are not supporting the S.A.T.U. group,  then\r\n\r\nI  think  they will allow the unions to continue  in\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the 2nd of February, various trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  have  been arrested. Before  the  elections\r\n\r\nmany  of them were arrested and after the elections,\r\n\r\nanother  hatch of leaders were arrested. Responsible\r\n\r\nofficials  of the trade unions have been nabbed.  In\r\n\r\nthe  end, the trade unions are left without leaders.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Government go on to smear them --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Again the hon.

The\r\n\r\nissue  was brought up. The S.A.T.U. union was banned\r\n\r\nbecause it was involved in treacherous activities in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorneo.  They  were banned because of that.  Because\r\n\r\nthey were preparing to involve Singapore in an armed\r\n\r\nrevolt and that has been admitted by none other than Mr Lim Shee Ping. He said in this statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In practice Communist activities in Malaya defeat\r\n\r\nthe very causes which they claim to champion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Mr Lim Shee Ping. And he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I deplore the recent violence in Brunei and\r\n\r\nSarawak   which  causes  unnecessary  suffering   to\r\n\r\ninnocent people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Lim Shee Ping was closely associated with\r\n\r\nthe  S.A.T.U. unions, is this not an admission  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis and the  pro-Communist  trade\r\n\r\nunionists were preparing to involve Singapore in the\r\n\r\narmed  violence in Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak?  That\r\n\r\nis why they were banned. Not because they were trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  but  because  they  were  preparing   to\r\n\r\ninvolve the workers of Singapore in the armed revolt\r\n\r\nin Brunei and Sarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, Mr Woodhull said openly that he was\r\n\r\nin   charge  of  unions  which  were  controlled  by\r\n\r\nCommunists. And I quote, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In pursuing my political and trade union\r\n\r\nactivities [and he was adviser to a great number  of\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions]  it is true  to  say  that  I  was\r\n\r\nindifferent as to whether Communists were associated\r\n\r\nwith  me.
