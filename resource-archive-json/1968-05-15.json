I would, however, like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on what the Member for Sembawang has said in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  He has criticised the administrative\r\n\r\nprocedures  of the Immigration Department,  saying\r\n\r\nthat  they  cause  delay. If my memory  serves  me\r\n\r\nright, I recall that the Member for Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\n-  he  is now the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance - raised a question relating\r\n\r\nto  immigration  when the House was  debating  the 1968  Budget.  Now  the Member  for  Sembawang  is\r\n\r\nraising  the same issue. So I will fry  some  cold\r\n\r\nrice for him to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, the Immigration Department has\r\n\r\nalready taken measures to improve the services for\r\n\r\ntourists  so  as  to facilitate their  entry  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. Tourists, therefore, need not  have  to\r\n\r\ngo  through cumbersome procedures before they  can\r\n\r\nvisit  Singapore for a few days, because they  can\r\n\r\nobtain visas quite easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourists from Indonesia stopping over in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will have things made easier for  them.\r\n\r\nOn  arrival at our airport, passengers with  valid\r\n\r\npassports are issued with visas for two months  so\r\n\r\nthat   they   may  enjoy  their  trip  here.   The\r\n\r\nImmigration Department is doing all this  to  make\r\n\r\nthings  easy  for the tourists. This will  promote\r\n\r\ntourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tourists coming by ship, we have also\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  enable  them  to  come  here  more\r\n\r\neasily. Some people who stay in Sembawang and  who\r\n\r\nfind  it  too far to go to the Immigration  Office\r\n\r\nmight have asked the Member for Sembawang to raise\r\n\r\nthis matter in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the start\r\n\r\nof my speech. I would like to invite the attention\r\n\r\nof  all  hon.  Members  to  a  Government  Gazette\r\n\r\nSubsidiary Legislation Supplement published on the\r\n\r\n10th of May and numbered 35 of 1968. At pages  285\r\n\r\nto 296 thereof are set out the responsibilities of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and other Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only change in the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment is in respect of the Registry  of  Co-operative Societies which has been transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Social Affairs. Money Lenders and\r\n\r\nPawnbrokers  have  also been  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Social Affairs. They were  previously\r\n\r\nwith the Ministry of Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies and the Registry of Business Names have\r\n\r\nalso left Law for the Ministry of Finance. But the\r\n\r\nmajor  change, as far as the Ministry  of  Law  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  is the transfer of the Port  Authority\r\n\r\nto  the Ministry of Communications, as it is  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the Port and the Department of Marine should\r\n\r\nappropriately  come under the same  Ministry.  The\r\n\r\nproblems of the reorganisation of the Dockyard and\r\n\r\nthe containerisation complex at the Eastern Lagoon\r\n\r\nare  now  put  on  the  lap of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board, which was formerly\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry of the Deputy Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nis  now back in the Ministry of Law, and questions\r\n\r\nin  this  House  with regard  to  gas,  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity should now be directed to me. However,\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  to  be able to report that  frequent\r\n\r\nblackouts are a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthing  of  the past in Singapore and  that  it  is\r\n\r\nunlikely that we will have water rationing in  the\r\n\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is significant that the\r\n\r\nconsumption of water in Singapore has now exceeded\r\n\r\nthe 100-million gallon mark. We are consuming over\r\n\r\n100  million gallons of water a day. But  we  have\r\n\r\nnew  schemes  and  we  have  had  new  schemes  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the  water  supply.  Members   may   be\r\n\r\ninterested  to know that when water rationing  had\r\n\r\nto be imposed in the year 1963, Singapore only con\r\n\r\nsumed  about 65 million gallons a day.  Today  the\r\n\r\nconsumption has increased by more than 35  million\r\n\r\ngallons per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to speak both on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLaw  and  National  Development.  As  far  as  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law is concerned, I shall start  first\r\n\r\nwith  the laws of Singapore and give the  House  a\r\n\r\nshort  resume  of  events as they  might  help  in\r\n\r\nsetting out the present position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1963, Singapore had its own\r\n\r\nConstitution,  and  laws  made  up  of  Ordinances\r\n\r\npassed  by  the  Legislature, such  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Common  Law and certain English  Statutes\r\n\r\nthat  were made applicable to Singapore before  we\r\n\r\njoined  the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  were part of the Federation, on account of the\r\n\r\ndistribution of legislative subjects  between  the\r\n\r\nCentral   and  the  State  Legislatures,   certain\r\n\r\nexisting laws that came within the purview of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government were repealed and at the  same\r\n\r\ntime   laws   were  extended  in   the   name   of\r\n\r\n\"uniformity\"  to  Singapore  even  in  regard   to\r\n\r\nmatters   where  the  ipsissima   verba   of   the\r\n\r\nlegislation was in no way different, as  evidenced\r\n\r\nin  the Trustees Ordinance, or where the substance\r\n\r\nwas identical, as in the Internal Security Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a spate of subsidiary legislation made\r\n\r\nby   the   Central  Government  and  extended   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  some  of which were again  substituted\r\n\r\nfor  those  which were already in  existence.  The\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers (or the State Advocate-General's  Chambers as it then was) had been  hard\r\n\r\nput to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeeping  abreast with the changes of  these  laws,\r\n\r\nespecially  in certain instances where  copies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Ordinances that had been extended  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   in   place   of   existing   Singapore\r\n\r\nlegislation  had not been made available  even  to\r\n\r\ndepartments of state that were concerned with  the\r\n\r\nadministration of these Ordinances. Such  was  the\r\n\r\nstate of the laws that when banishment proceedings\r\n\r\nwere   taken   under  the  Federation   Banishment\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which, except for one or two procedural\r\n\r\nrequirements,  were  exactly  the  same   as   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Ordinance,  the first  of  these  cases\r\n\r\nactually resulted in the banishee succeeding on  a\r\n\r\nwrit  of  habeas  corpus. The police,  not  having\r\n\r\ncopies  of the Federation Ordinance, had proceeded\r\n\r\nunder  the  repealed provisions of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and, in doing so, had failed to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  certain  peremptory procedural  requirements\r\n\r\nthat were in the Federation Ordinance but were not\r\n\r\nin the State legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as if to add to the confusion, on the 9th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1965,  came the separation  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom the rest of Malaysia. Although the Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement  had  provided for the  continuation  of\r\n\r\nlaws  then existing until such time when they were\r\n\r\nchanged  by  Parliament in  Singapore,  this  only\r\n\r\nadded  to  the difficulties which both  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession   and   those   concerned   with    the\r\n\r\nadministration   of  justice  in  Singapore   were\r\n\r\nalready faced with. The work of unscrambling  laws\r\n\r\nthat had been extended to Singapore by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment then began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had then in 1965, as we do have now, such\r\n\r\nportions  of  the  Federal  laws  that  had   been\r\n\r\nextended  to Singapore existing side by side  with\r\n\r\nSingapore statutes that had been left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn  some cases, the extension of these laws by the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government in relation to  Singapore  had\r\n\r\nreversed the Singapore Government's policies,  as,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  the  Public Authorities  Protection\r\n\r\nOrdinance  of the Federation of Malaya.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad,  before it joined Malaysia, removed from  its\r\n\r\nstatute books a similar Ordinance giving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe public authorities the privileged position  of\r\n\r\nbeing protected from civil litigation for acts  of\r\n\r\nnegligence if these suits were not brought  within\r\n\r\nthe  period  of  one year of the cause  of  action\r\n\r\narising.  Accordingly, when  we  separated  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent  Republic from the rest  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance had likewise to be removed in order\r\n\r\nthat  we  could  return  to  the  status  quo.  In\r\n\r\nDecember   1965,   the   Republic   of   Singapore\r\n\r\nIndependence  Act  was  passed  with   retroactive\r\n\r\noperation   to  the  9th  August  of  that   year.\r\n\r\nSingapore then became a Republic with effect  from\r\n\r\nthe  9th  day of August, 1965. But we had perforce\r\n\r\nto  continue  with the Singapore Constitution  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  Order  in  Council  dated  the  16th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1963, a Constitution drafted and  meant\r\n\r\nfor the State of Singapore as a component part  of\r\n\r\nthe larger Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution as it then was had obvious\r\n\r\nlacunae. Accordingly, all these provisions dealing\r\n\r\nwith   such   subjects  as  had  been  exclusively\r\n\r\nassigned to the Federal Legislature that had to be\r\n\r\nadopted    with   such   amendments   that    were\r\n\r\nincompatible  with  Singapore  as  an  independent\r\n\r\nRepublic  had to be so amended as to  accord  with\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional changes that had come to pass.\r\n\r\nThe  Independence  Act of 1965,  as  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nknow,   accordingly  adopted  as   part   of   our\r\n\r\nConstitution    the   whole   of    the    Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution,  save  in regard  to  those  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  had been provided for in the original State\r\n\r\nConstitution.   Consequent   upon   our   becoming\r\n\r\nindependent,  no less than 25 Acts  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwere  passed during the remaining months of  1965.\r\n\r\nIn  1966,  a total of 57 Acts were passed  and  in\r\n\r\n1967  another 43 Acts were passed. Many  of  these\r\n\r\nActs  were far-reaching in their effects upon  the\r\n\r\nlife and economy of the nation. Little wonder that\r\n\r\nmembers  of the legal profession themselves  found\r\n\r\nit  hard to keep abreast with these changes,  some\r\n\r\nof  which were necessitated by the very change  in\r\n\r\nour  constitutional progress towards independence.\r\n\r\nIn   order  to  make  this  task  easier  for  the\r\n\r\nprofession   and  for  those  charged   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of administering the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw,  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  reprinted\r\n\r\nsome  of  the more important Ordinances which  had\r\n\r\nbeen  subject to such amendment. No less than some\r\n\r\n30  of our laws have been thus brought up to date,\r\n\r\nincluding the State Constitution itself. At  about\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  a  Law Revision  Commission  was\r\n\r\nappointed, charged with the task of rewriting  the\r\n\r\nlaws and bringing them up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, the last time die laws of\r\n\r\nSingapore were subject to such a revision was some\r\n\r\n15 years ago; the task then took no less than five\r\n\r\nyears to complete. Special mention may perhaps  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  the Legal Profession Act which now  sets\r\n\r\nout  the basis of legal education and of admission\r\n\r\nto  the Bar in Singapore. The disciplinary control\r\n\r\nof  members of the profession had been left almost\r\n\r\nentirely   to   the  Society  of   Advocates   and\r\n\r\nSolicitors.  Even  this Act has  been  subject  to\r\n\r\namendments and will be in the course of this  year\r\n\r\nsubject  to  further amendments at the request  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught up with the more momentous changes which\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  brought about and which  had  claimed\r\n\r\npriority over other changes, our courts have  been\r\n\r\nleft  to carry on within the legal framework  that\r\n\r\nhad  been  laid  down when we  were  part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaysia - hence the  existence  of\r\n\r\nprocedures   and  terms  that  now  would   appear\r\n\r\nsomewhat  anachronistic.  The  existence  of   the\r\n\r\nFederal  Court  in Singapore is a  clear  example.\r\n\r\nThough in practice the Federal Court, which is the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal in Singapore, is presided over  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Justice with two other Judges  of  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court in Singapore, and the practice since we\r\n\r\nseceded  from the Federation of Malaysia has  been\r\n\r\nthat  only  Singapore Judges sit  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nCourt  in  Singapore, the strict legal basis  from\r\n\r\nwhich  the Court draws its jurisdiction and powers\r\n\r\nis  still  the  Federal Courts of Judicature  Act.\r\n\r\nSteps,  however,  are now being taken  to  correct\r\n\r\nthis anomalous situation in the law. Right at this\r\n\r\nmoment,  a  change in the system of the courts  is\r\n\r\nbeing   thought  out  and  legislation  is   being\r\n\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  will be interested to know  that  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwill soon be introduced to provide for a Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal  in  place  of the Federal  Court  so  that\r\n\r\nstrict law may accord with practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may or should remember that towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1966 the Report of the Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission   headed  by  the  Chief  Justice   was\r\n\r\npresented to this House. I then told the House  in\r\n\r\na  Ministerial  statement that the Government  had\r\n\r\naccepted  the  Report in principle  and  would  be\r\n\r\nintroducing a draft Constitution embodying most of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the Commission,  save  in\r\n\r\nregard  to one or two matters such as the creation\r\n\r\nof  the Ombudsman, the idea behind the creation of\r\n\r\nwhich  would be fully subscribed to but which  we,\r\n\r\nhowever,   regard  as  somewhat  premature.   This\r\n\r\nimportant  epoch-making charter will be introduced\r\n\r\nin the course of the next few months and certainly\r\n\r\nat  the  very latest by the end of this  year.  In\r\n\r\norder  that the views of as wide a section of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore as possible may be canvassed,\r\n\r\nthe  Draft  Constitution will be  sent  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  In the making of our Constitution,  it\r\n\r\nis  indeed the desire of the Government to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore should be given every\r\n\r\nopportunity to air their views so that it  may  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the people have given unto  themselves\r\n\r\nthese  guiding  principles of social  justice  and\r\n\r\nequality amongst men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now propose to deal with\r\n\r\nother  departments of the Ministry of  Law  -  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office and the Registry of Deeds.  The  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition   Act  was  passed  by  the   previous\r\n\r\nParliament on the 26th of October, 1966, and  came\r\n\r\ninto operation on the 17th of June last year.  The\r\n\r\nmajor innovation in the Act is that an appeal by a\r\n\r\nperson  aggrieved by an award of the Collector  of\r\n\r\nLand Revenue, which previously used to lie to  the\r\n\r\nHigh   Court,  now  lies  to  the  Appeals   Board\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  a Commissioner of  Appeals,  or  a\r\n\r\nDeputy  Commissioner  of Appeals,  either  sitting\r\n\r\nalone or with two assessors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the quantum of the  award  appealed\r\n\r\nagainst.  Before this Act came into  operation,  a\r\n\r\ntotal of 261 appeals or objections had been lodged\r\n\r\nand  were  awaiting disposal. This number  covered\r\n\r\nobjections going back to acquisitions carried  out\r\n\r\nin  1953  and  to accumulations from 1964  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  the  suspension  imposed  on  the  Collector\r\n\r\nprecluding him from referring appeals to the  High\r\n\r\nCourt under the provisions of the Land Acquisition\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Ordinance. 1964, which came into force\r\n\r\non  the  11th  June, 1964. After the  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation of the Land Acquisition Act, a total  of\r\n\r\n97 old appeals were brought forward for disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Board was formally constituted and\r\n\r\ntwo  Judges  of  the  High  Court  were  appointed\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Appeals on 17th June,  1967,  and\r\n\r\non  the  same  date,  12  persons  were  appointed\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the panel as provided for under  Part\r\n\r\nIII  of  the  Act.  Since its  constitution,  five\r\n\r\nappeal  cases  were  dealt with  by  it.  Of  this\r\n\r\nnumber,  the  Board in four cases awarded  against\r\n\r\nthe  Collector, requiring the payment of a sum  of\r\n\r\nabout   half   a  million  dollars   by   way   of\r\n\r\nsupplementary  awards. The Board  awarded  against\r\n\r\nthe  appellant  in  one  case.  Three  cases  were\r\n\r\nwithdrawn and six were settled out of Court  since\r\n\r\nthe  coming  into force of the new  Act.  Some  22\r\n\r\ncases are likely to be settled out of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a tremendous amount of research and work is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the proper preparation of  an  appeal\r\n\r\ncase for presentation to the Appeals Board. Delays\r\n\r\nmay  occur  when, in the midst of such preparatory\r\n\r\nwork, appellants make overtures for settlement out\r\n\r\nof  Court, or the Collector, on completion  of  an\r\n\r\nappeal case, considers that the difference  is  so\r\n\r\nmarginal  that the appellant may wish to  consider\r\n\r\nsettlement out of Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to introduce certain amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  Act  with  a  view to incorporating  into  it\r\n\r\ncertain   provisions  of  the  former  legislation\r\n\r\nrelating to the recovery of costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Commissioners of the Appeals Board has\r\n\r\nsince retired and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration is being given to the possibility of\r\n\r\nappointing  a  permanent  Commissioner  with   the\r\n\r\nrequisite status of a High Court Judge. This will,\r\n\r\nof  course,  be dependent on a number of  factors,\r\n\r\nnot  least  of all the availability of a  suitable\r\n\r\nperson with the requisite qualification and  know-how.  It is desirable also to consider steps which\r\n\r\nwill  alleviate the position caused by the  recent\r\n\r\nand the pending retirement of High Court Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Land Titles Strata Act of\r\n\r\n1967  was  first introduced in its  Bill  form  in\r\n\r\n1966.  The  Act  mainly deals with  the  issue  of\r\n\r\ncertificates  of titles to flats,  the  management\r\n\r\nand  maintenance of such flats and common services\r\n\r\nrelating  thereto by a Management  Corporation  of\r\n\r\nwhich  all the flat owners are members.  This  Act\r\n\r\nwas  passed  in  1967 and brought  into  operation\r\n\r\ntoday. It requires every housing developer of  any\r\n\r\nnew  development  of flats to lodge  in  a  strata\r\n\r\ntitle plan showing the location of the sub-divided\r\n\r\nbuilding comprising the flats sold or to  be  sold\r\n\r\nto  the  members  of  the  public,  and  also  the\r\n\r\napproximate dimensions of each flat and the common\r\n\r\nproperty,  including the staircases  and  passages\r\n\r\nand  any  ground or floor space. The  share  units\r\n\r\nwhich  each owner of the flat is entitled to  must\r\n\r\nbe also shown on such plan. Each owner of the flat\r\n\r\nwill  under the Act be entitled to a share in  the\r\n\r\nland  on which the sub-divided building comprising\r\n\r\nthe  flats  is erected proportionate to his  share\r\n\r\nunit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no provision under the common law\r\n\r\nfor  the vesting of titles in the land should  the\r\n\r\nsub-divided building become seriously  damaged  or\r\n\r\ndemolished.  There  are  provisions  in  the   Act\r\n\r\ngoverning    damaged   or   destroyed   subdivided\r\n\r\nbuildings.  Owners of all flats dealt  under  this\r\n\r\nAct    should,   therefore,   benefit   from   its\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easements which would necessarily be created for\r\n\r\nflats  and the transfer or lease of flats such  as\r\n\r\neasements of support or shelter and protection and\r\n\r\neasement for passage of water, drainage and  other\r\n\r\nservices are spelt out in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct. This will leave no doubt in the minds of  the\r\n\r\nowners of flats of their rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of the Act, the purchaser\r\n\r\nmay  be granted a freehold title to a flat and not\r\n\r\nonly  a  leasehold title as under the common  law.\r\n\r\nProposed  mortgages would also be in a far  better\r\n\r\nposition with special provisions being set out  in\r\n\r\ncases  where sub-divided buildings are damaged  or\r\n\r\ndestroyed. It is hoped that longer-term loans will\r\n\r\nbe  available  to intending purchasers  of  flats.\r\n\r\nThus    indirectly   flat   ownership   is   being\r\n\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof National Development which is, as Members know,\r\n\r\nmainly  concerned with housing. Sir,  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Board has had considerable success\r\n\r\nin  implementing the public housing policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Yet far from resting on its  laurels,\r\n\r\nthe  Board has been looking into various ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  of  improving  the  amenities  in  existing\r\n\r\nhousing   estates  and  the  layout,  design   and\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  new  housing  estates.  For  one\r\n\r\nthing,  with  the  success of the  home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme,  the demand is for better types of housing\r\n\r\nthough  still at low cost to be designed for  sale\r\n\r\nto  those  of  our citizens wishing to  own  their\r\n\r\nhomes.  In line with Government's policy  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  the cleanest and the greenest  city  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia, there is every need for increased\r\n\r\nefforts  to  beautify the many housing estates  by\r\n\r\ntasteful  landscaping and the better  planting  of\r\n\r\ntrees,  shrubs and flowers in the open areas.  The\r\n\r\nexperience  gained in designing and  planning  the\r\n\r\nearlier  housing  estates will contribute  towards\r\n\r\nthe improvement of layouts of new housing estates,\r\n\r\nand  our  architects and planners will  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the fact that notwithstanding  low-cost housing our tenants will eventually be owning\r\n\r\nmore and more cars. Thus traffic circulation is of\r\n\r\nimportance and generous provisions may have to  be\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  new towns for community activities,\r\n\r\nchildren's   playgrounds  and  other  recreational\r\n\r\namenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board does not think\r\n\r\nin  terms of its immediate programme which is well\r\n\r\nin  hand.  In addition to providing the  planning,\r\n\r\nsupervision, construction and management  and  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of existing and new housing  estates,\r\n\r\nit  must do the spade work and investigations  for\r\n\r\nthe  next  two  5-year periods. For instance,  the\r\n\r\nBoard   is   now   planning  the   lay-out,   land\r\n\r\nacquisition  and  clearance for  the  new  housing\r\n\r\nestates  to be built in Telok Blangah in  1970  to\r\n\r\n1975 and also looking into the development of  new\r\n\r\ntowns  likely  to be constructed after  1975.  All\r\n\r\nthis   planning  and  investigation  will  be   in\r\n\r\naddition  to  its  present  work  in  constructing\r\n\r\npublic  housing in Jurong. Toa Payoh,  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nTiong   Bahru,  Alexandra,  Kallang   Basin,   St.\r\n\r\nMichael's  Estate, MacPherson and other areas.  In\r\n\r\nplanning and executing projects of this magnitude,\r\n\r\nit is necessary for me to remind hon. Members that\r\n\r\nin  the  process  of  land  acquisition,  squatter\r\n\r\nclearance,  resettlement, earth-works, road  works\r\n\r\nand   other   civil  construction  work,   certain\r\n\r\ninconvenience and disturbance must be caused to  a\r\n\r\ncertain number of people. But bearing in mind that\r\n\r\nhundreds  and  thousands of people are  likely  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  these operations, it is  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nvery low price to pay, but even so the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board has been instructed to  exercise\r\n\r\nevery   care   and  consideration  and,   wherever\r\n\r\npossible, to cause the minimum of inconvenience to\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Coast reclamation project is one case in\r\n\r\npoint.  Members  may  recall that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould have decided with some savings to adopt  the\r\n\r\nconventional  method of earth moving  which  would\r\n\r\nresult  in  hundreds of lorries shuttling  up  and\r\n\r\ndown  carrying full loads of earth some  of  which\r\n\r\nwould  spill  over on to our roads,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  stirring  up  considerable  dust  nuisance,\r\n\r\ncausing traffic congestion and frustration, not to\r\n\r\nmention  creating a noise nuisance to disturb  the\r\n\r\npopulation for many years. Instead, the Government\r\n\r\ndecided on the most sophisticated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmethod  of  earth moving, involving  huge  bucket-wheel  excavators  and  more  than  six  miles  of\r\n\r\nconveyor belts to excavate and transport the earth\r\n\r\nnoiselessly,  with  little dust nuisance,  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  or  other inconvenience being  caused.\r\n\r\nYet,  in  spite of all these efforts, because  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  have to be completed  according  to  a\r\n\r\nrigid  time schedule and the work has to go  on  a\r\n\r\nthree-shift basis, there have been some complaints\r\n\r\nby residents around the Bedok area that the bucket-wheel  excavators were disturbing them from  their\r\n\r\nsleep, even though such excavators made less noise\r\n\r\nthan ordinary bulldozers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the design of public housing, the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  has  been  investigating   and\r\n\r\nexperimenting with new forms of tower blocks which\r\n\r\nwould  provide a new appearance and better privacy\r\n\r\nfor  the  tenants.  If costs permit,  these  tower\r\n\r\nblocks  will  have the ground floor free  for  the\r\n\r\nrecreation  of  tenants and  their  children.  The\r\n\r\nfirst of these new blocks of housing accommodation\r\n\r\nwill  be  constructed in the next few  months  and\r\n\r\nwill be ready for occupation or sale in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to urban renewal. On\r\n\r\nthis subject, the Government has already completed\r\n\r\nthe  first  blocks  of  urban  renewal  flats   in\r\n\r\nCrawford  N.  1 and Outram Road S.  1  areas.  The\r\n\r\nconstruction of urban renewal projects will go  on\r\n\r\nwith  greater vigour. New projects will be carried\r\n\r\nout  within  the  centre of the  city  which  will\r\n\r\nindicate  to  the  private  sector  the  line   of\r\n\r\nthinking  that has been adopted by the  Government\r\n\r\nin its urban renewal policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new projects will involve a departure from\r\n\r\nthe  traditional  way of building  row  houses  or\r\n\r\nshophouses  with  16  to  20  feet  frontage.  The\r\n\r\nthinking is to concentrate on heavy investment  on\r\n\r\nproperly planned and comprehensive development for\r\n\r\nthe   construction  of  shopping  complexes   with\r\n\r\nliterally  hundreds  of arcaded  shops  under  one\r\n\r\nroof,  with pedestrian malls for easier  shopping,\r\n\r\nand  with  easy parking facilities at basement  or\r\n\r\nground  level. This will improve the amenities  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncity  centre,   provide   much   more   pleasant\r\n\r\nsurroundings     for     pedestrians,      greater\r\n\r\nmanoeuvrability for traffic, and increase  parking\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  motorists. The  Government  would\r\n\r\nvery  much  like  to  see this  type  of  thinking\r\n\r\npermeating  into  the  private  sector  so   that,\r\n\r\ninstead of thinking in terms of redeveloping  just\r\n\r\ntwo  or three shophouses, private investors  would\r\n\r\njoin  forces  and  go  into much  bigger  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes within the city. These are the  portents\r\n\r\nfor  the future and it is hoped that with the  co-operation   of   the  private  sector,   we   will\r\n\r\neventually be able, not only to change the skyline\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  but  also  to  improve  pedestrian\r\n\r\nshopping amenities and, in the process, change the\r\n\r\nolder  areas of the city by replacing the existing\r\n\r\ntwo- and three-row houses and shophouses with high\r\n\r\nrise  prestige  buildings  incorporating  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  expected for the  central  area  of  a\r\n\r\nmodern city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may go back to the East\r\n\r\nCoast  reclamation, Members may be  interested  to\r\n\r\nknow that the work of reclaiming land from the sea\r\n\r\nfrom Bedok to the Singapore Swimming Club will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in the middle of next year. The progress\r\n\r\nhas been very satisfactory and the work is well in\r\n\r\nadvance  of  schedule. The amount of earth  washed\r\n\r\naway  by the sea has also been less than expected.\r\n\r\nThe  second stage will be the reclamation from the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Swimming Club right up to  the  end  of\r\n\r\nTanjong Rhu. This will mean the transportation  by\r\n\r\nconveyor-belt of some three million cubic yards of\r\n\r\nearth.  This additional work is expected  to  take\r\n\r\nfive  or  six months, so that by the end of  1969,\r\n\r\nthe  whole stretch of the shore from Bedok to  the\r\n\r\nend of Tanjong Rhu will be reclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much investigation work has also been done with\r\n\r\nregard  to the next phase of the reclamation  work\r\n\r\nwhich  involves the filling up of  the  sea  along\r\n\r\nNicoll  Highway and the Esplanade. Some 200  acres\r\n\r\nof  land can be reclaimed from this portion of the\r\n\r\nsea  using earth from the Telok Blangah and Siglap\r\n\r\nareas.  The difficulty here is that the  conveyor-belt system cannot be used because the route\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncuts   into   the  road  network  of  the   city.\r\n\r\nConventional methods may have to be adopted, which\r\n\r\nmeans   the   process  will  be  slow   and   much\r\n\r\ninconvenience  will  result.  The  engineers   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff of the Housing Board are  looking\r\n\r\ninto   various  alternatives  to  carry  out  this\r\n\r\nproject  which  will cost about $20  million.  One\r\n\r\nsolution  that has been suggested is to work  only\r\n\r\nat nights when the roads will not be so heavy with\r\n\r\ntraffic.  Another alternative is to use boats  and\r\n\r\nbarges,  but  this will result in double  handling\r\n\r\nand higher costs. Whatever the difficulties, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to implement this project, if more  land\r\n\r\nis  to  be  reclaimed  and  the  proposed  coastal\r\n\r\nhighway is to be completed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the participation of the private\r\n\r\nsector in our urban renewal efforts, I am happy to\r\n\r\nsay  that the sites along the \"Golden Mile\", which\r\n\r\nmet  with little response when the first 14  sites\r\n\r\nwere made available by public tender in the middle\r\n\r\nof  1967, have now aroused the interest of various\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and  hoteliers.  In  line  with   this\r\n\r\npolicy,   my   Ministry  has  drawn   up   special\r\n\r\nprocedures  to expedite the granting  of  planning\r\n\r\napproval  and  to  waive  development  charges  in\r\n\r\nrespect of good class tourist hotels. Briefly, the\r\n\r\nnew  procedure  involves the  elimination  of  the\r\n\r\ncumbersome  and unwieldy process of rezoning.  For\r\n\r\nthe next three years whilst this new procedure  is\r\n\r\nin  operation, special consideration will be given\r\n\r\nto  applications for the development of good class\r\n\r\ntourist hotels. No development charge for rezoning\r\n\r\nor  change  of use will be levied in any  approved\r\n\r\nhotel project. But in order to ensure that genuine\r\n\r\ndevelopment  commences at an  early  date  and  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  the  speculative type of  development,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will require  the  payment  of  a\r\n\r\nrefundable  deposit  in  respect  of  every  hotel\r\n\r\napplication.  The progress of every hotel  project\r\n\r\nwill  be reviewed every six months so that if  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  work  is  in  compliance  with   the\r\n\r\nconditions  in  the  planning approval,  then  the\r\n\r\ndeposit will be completely refunded at the end  of\r\n\r\n12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry hopes that the private sector will take\r\n\r\nfull advantage of this new procedure during the next three\r\n\r\nyears in order to enable the present hotel shortage to be\r\n\r\novercome. Hon. Members will be interested to know that as at\r\n\r\n30th, April, 1968, there were 23 tourist class hotels with\r\n\r\n1,694 rooms in Singapore. Planning approval has been granted\r\n\r\nfor the development of 28 other hotel projects involving\r\n\r\neither new construction, alterations or amendments to\r\n\r\nexisting buildings. All these approvals, if implemented,\r\n\r\nwill result in a further 6,000 rooms or more, but some of\r\n\r\nthem are clearly speculative in nature and the developers\r\n\r\nperhaps have no intention whatsoever of  implementing the\r\n\r\nprojects. But with the new procedures that have been\r\n\r\nintroduced, speculation will be drastically reduced and in\r\n\r\nthe next few years or so, it is hoped that Singapore will be\r\n\r\nable to meet the demands of all tourists for better class\r\n\r\nhotels. Of the 28 projects approved, only four new hotels\r\n\r\n(the Mandarin, the Hilton and Ming Court in Orchard Road and\r\n\r\nthe Lion City Hotel in Tanjong Katong) are under\r\n\r\nconstruction and on their completion will add a further\r\n\r\n1,431 rooms to meet tourist demands. Another seven extension\r\n\r\nor conversion projects are also being actively pursued which\r\n\r\non completion will produce another 1,500 rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now go on to the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. Over the last few years, there has been\r\n\r\nconsiderable activity in the construction of public roads,\r\n\r\ndrainage and sewerage extensions. All these are necessary to\r\n\r\nkeep pace with other construction and development. Not only\r\n\r\nwill existing roads be widen and road junctions or\r\n\r\nintersections grade separated, multi-level traffic\r\n\r\ninterchanges and flyovers be provided, but there will also\r\n\r\nbe new highways to be constructed to ensure a smoother flow\r\n\r\nof traffic. Sewage works will be carried out to provide\r\n\r\nmodern sanitation to many suburban areas. Flood alleviation\r\n\r\nschemes will be implemented to relieve some of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworst areas of the island from being flooded every time a\r\n\r\nheavy shower coincides with a high tide. Here again hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will appreciate that in all these public works which\r\n\r\nentail land acquisition, resettlement, squatter clearance,\r\n\r\nthe digging up of roads and considerable amount of earth-\r\n\r\nworks, much inconvenience to the public and disruption of\r\n\r\ntraffic must be caused. It is expected that many people will\r\n\r\nexpress their grievances. There will be many complaints and\r\n\r\nso will may of those affected by resettlement grumble about\r\n\r\nthe inadequacy of our compensation schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but the normal difficulties any public\r\n\r\nauthority will have to face in a period of very rapid\r\n\r\nconstruction and development. It will be too much to expect\r\n\r\nthat no person will be dissatisfied when hundreds of\r\n\r\nfamilies are required to move away from places where they\r\n\r\nhave been living for many many years. But one only has to\r\n\r\nlook into the records of the Resettlement Department to see\r\n\r\nhow many families have been resettled satisfactorily. In the\r\n\r\nmajority to resettlement cases, there has been best\r\n\r\nimprovement in their standards of accommodation, whilst many\r\n\r\nhave found new jobs and benefited from the changed\r\n\r\nsurroundings. These are sufficient evidence and indications\r\n\r\nfor us to conclude that the minor inconvenience that is\r\n\r\ncaused, far from being something that should cause us\r\n\r\nconcern, would rather in the long term be recognised as the\r\n\r\nchange that brought about the improvement in the livelihood\r\n\r\nof the families who have previously been used to living in\r\n\r\nthe slums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I will deal with\r\n\r\ncomprehensive city planning. Notwithstanding all the\r\n\r\nhousing, reclamation, urban renewal and public work projects\r\n\r\nthat I have mentioned, the Government must think further\r\n\r\nahead in terms of the more efficient use of our very limited\r\n\r\nland resources, of  the greater efficiency of our public\r\n\r\nroads network, and of the more economical utilisation of our\r\n\r\nscarce financial resources. To achieve all these, a better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand more flexible comprehensive planning concept must be\r\n\r\ndevised which can result in the creation of a city with all\r\n\r\nthe amenities one would expect of a highly civilised centre\r\n\r\nwith more efficient control of private development to\r\n\r\nprovide the necessary improvements and extensions to cater\r\n\r\nfor a population of three to four million before the end of\r\n\r\nthe century. I say three to four million advisedly, because\r\n\r\neven now the population projection provided in the early\r\n\r\n1960s when the rate of increase was above four per cent is\r\n\r\nbeing lowered to near 2.3 per cent. Hence, instead of having\r\n\r\na population of four million in 1990, we may probably only\r\n\r\nreach 3\u00bc million. This is indeed heartening because more\r\n\r\ntime will be available for us to plan for a better city to\r\n\r\ncater for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State and City Planning Committee, which has been\r\n\r\nset up with the assistance of the United Nations Special\r\n\r\nFund will be looking into this long-term problem of city\r\n\r\nplanning and will probably come up with some solutions for\r\n\r\nbetter land use and development control and for more\r\n\r\nrealistic planning concepts for the development of the\r\n\r\nfuture of our city. It is also entrusted with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of doing studies, surveys and projections\r\n\r\nwhich will provide for comprehensive development of our\r\n\r\ntraffic and communications network to ensure that we will be\r\n\r\nable to  keep abreast of our traffic problems. As the city\r\n\r\nhas been built up over the last 150 years and some areas\r\n\r\nwould not be so easily amenable to drastic change, the need\r\n\r\nfor some form of mass transportation to enable a large\r\n\r\nnumber of  workers to get to town as quickly and\r\n\r\neconomically as possible cannot be over-looked. This will\r\n\r\nmean expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars on a\r\n\r\nsystem of either surface railways, mono-rails or underground\r\n\r\nrailways or some form of rapid transportation to shuttle\r\n\r\nlarge numbers of people from the places of their residence\r\n\r\nto their places of work. Sir, all these are problems that we\r\n\r\nwill have to face and study in greater detail in the years\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my Minister has\r\n\r\nasked me to speak on the services rendered by my Ministry.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of question on Primary Production services\r\n\r\nhave been raised, particularly by Members of Parliament from\r\n\r\nrural constituencies. I am happy that they are concerned\r\n\r\nwith the work of the Primary Production Department as the\r\n\r\ndepartment is responsible for agriculture and fisheries\r\n\r\ndevelopment and provides services to farmers and fishermen\r\n\r\nin the rural areas.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, in referring to that part of\r\n\r\nthe President's Speech concerning the continued provision of\r\n\r\nservices and advice to farmers in order to increase\r\n\r\nproduction and to reduce cost, stated that he would like to\r\n\r\nknow how this was to be done. But he immediately followed\r\n\r\nthis question by enumerating a number of measures which, in\r\n\r\neffect, answered his own question!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some criticism have also been made by Members against\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department. While there is still much\r\n\r\nwork to be done, there is always room for improvement. The\r\n\r\nrecord of work since the inception of the department in 1960\r\n\r\nand the services it provides to the farming communities as\r\n\r\nwell as the role it plays in helping the farmers to solve\r\n\r\ntheir problems are familiar to many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to indulge in enumerating the\r\n\r\nachievements of the department, but it is well known to the\r\n\r\nfarming communities, and I have no doubt also to Members of\r\n\r\nParliament from rural constituencies, that the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has established in recent years 11\r\n\r\nagricultural stations and centres in the rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas   to   provide  services  such  as   poultry\r\n\r\ninoculation,  treatment  of  livestock,  ploughing\r\n\r\nservice,  sale  of veterinary drugs,  insecticides\r\n\r\nand  fertilisers, stud-boar service and artificial\r\n\r\ninsemination  of  pigs, distribution  of  improved\r\n\r\nbreeds  of  piglings and chicks to farmers,  plant\r\n\r\nprotection  service,  training  of  farm   youths,\r\n\r\nconducting talks with groups of farmers  in  their\r\n\r\nvillages,   publication  of  a   monthly   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Bulletin and booklets and pamphlets  to\r\n\r\ndisseminate information, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the change of circumstances since Singapore\r\n\r\nbecame   independent,  our  aim  is   to   further\r\n\r\nintensify  and diversify agricultural  development\r\n\r\nwithin  the  limited land areas which are  at  our\r\n\r\ndisposal  as well as to develop rapidly  off-shore\r\n\r\nand  deep-sea  fishing.  The  development  of  the\r\n\r\nagriculture and fisheries sectors is necessary  to\r\n\r\ngenerate employment for the large numbers of young\r\n\r\npeople coming into the employment market each year\r\n\r\nto supplement the Government's effort in providing\r\n\r\njobs  through industrialisation. Such  development\r\n\r\nis  also necessary for the economic well-being  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Our effort in agriculture and fisheries\r\n\r\ndevelopment will be in four directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we shall provide training for our youths\r\n\r\nin  intensive  agriculture,  horticulture,  animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry  and  fisheries to equip them  with  the\r\n\r\nskill in these fields of economic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we shall introduce new methods and\r\n\r\nscientific techniques in intensive agriculture and\r\n\r\nfisheries,    including   the    development    of\r\n\r\nagricultural and fisheries processing  industries.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also carry out research in these fields.\r\n\r\nWith advanced and modern techniques of production,\r\n\r\nour  farmers  and  fishermen should  produce  more\r\n\r\nefficiently and turn out agricultural produce of a\r\n\r\nhigh  quality.  This  will enable  us  to  compete\r\n\r\neffectively in markets outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we shall induce capital investment into\r\n\r\nthe  agriculture  and fisheries  sectors  so  that\r\n\r\nagriculture and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfisheries    in   Singapore   can   be   gradually\r\n\r\ntransformed  from  their  present-day  subsistence\r\n\r\nform  of  farming  and fishing, into  economically\r\n\r\nviable and profitable enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we shall develop and cultivate oversea\r\n\r\nmarkets   for   our  agricultural  and   fisheries\r\n\r\nproducts to increase our export earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these aims, a number of projects have\r\n\r\nalready  been  implemented and  others  are  being\r\n\r\nplanned.  Among the projects recently implemented,\r\n\r\na   $9  million  Pig  and  Poultry  Research  and.\r\n\r\nTraining   Institute  in  Sembawang  with   United\r\n\r\nNations  assistance  is being  established  and  a\r\n\r\nFishing  Training School costing $8 million,  also\r\n\r\nwith United Nations assistance, is being built. We\r\n\r\nhave  constructed a Veterinary Laboratory  costing\r\n\r\n$250,000  to improve animal health and to  produce\r\n\r\nvaccines  for preventive inoculation in  order  to\r\n\r\nminimise  losses from livestock diseases.  We  are\r\n\r\nimplementing an intensive farm improvement  scheme\r\n\r\nto  encourage orchid production for export and  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate   into   the   production   of   other\r\n\r\nhorticultural   products.  A  Regional   Fisheries\r\n\r\nResearch  Department  under  the  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nFisheries  Development Centre to  explore  fishing\r\n\r\ngrounds  in  this  region and a  Fishing  Port  at\r\n\r\nJurong  to stimulate fisheries development are  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of being established. We will improve\r\n\r\nthe Van Kleef Aquarium and will carry out training\r\n\r\nand  research  in aquarium fish  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nencourage  increased production  of  tropical  and\r\n\r\naquarium fish for export to oversea countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking into financial loan schemes for\r\n\r\nagriculture  and fisheries projects and  examining\r\n\r\nvarious  incentives  to attract  participation  of\r\n\r\nprivate  capital  in these fields.  We  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  bring the producers and  exporters  of\r\n\r\nagricultural  produce together so that  supply  to\r\n\r\noversea markets can be maintained, quality can  be\r\n\r\nguaranteed and prices can be competitive. We  have\r\n\r\nconstructed   a   modern   Abattoir   and   Animal\r\n\r\nQuarantine Station at Jurong so that livestock is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   only   sold   on-the-hoof  to   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  but  can also be exported  to  markets\r\n\r\nfurther afield after canning or processing. We are\r\n\r\nmaking a feasibility study of the different  forms\r\n\r\nof  factory  farming and the adoption  of  flatted\r\n\r\nfarms for livestock production in order to achieve\r\n\r\nthe maximum economy of land use in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New measures and new methods always involve\r\n\r\nchanges, and changes are not universally liked  by\r\n\r\npeople,  particularly those with vested  interest.\r\n\r\nWe  have encountered considerable resistance  from\r\n\r\nfish  merchants  against the Jurong  Fish  Market.\r\n\r\nAfter  more  than a year of effort in  persuasion,\r\n\r\nexplanation  and  discussion, the  fish  merchants\r\n\r\nhave   now  finally  agreed  to  move  to  Jurong.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,   there   is  considerable   resistance\r\n\r\nagainst  the  new abattoir. There  are  three  old\r\n\r\nabattoirs  in  Singapore; the sheep  abattoir  and\r\n\r\ncattle  abattoir in Jalan Besar and a pig abattoir\r\n\r\nin  French Road. In these abattoirs there has been\r\n\r\na  great  deal of malpractice and corruption.  The\r\n\r\nhygienic  standards  as well as  the  slaughtering\r\n\r\nmethod  are  not  acceptable  to  many  countries.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  our canned meat and processed  meat\r\n\r\ncannot   be   exported.  The  new   abattoir   was\r\n\r\nconstructed  with the objectives of improving  the\r\n\r\nslaughtering  facilities,  raising  the   hygienic\r\n\r\nstandards    and   eliminating   corruption    and\r\n\r\nmalpractices  so  that  Singapore  meat   can   be\r\n\r\nexported   to   other  countries.  However,   many\r\n\r\nbutchers do not like it. Voices have been  raised,\r\n\r\ncomplaints  have been made and rumours  have  been\r\n\r\nspread about the new abattoir. Unfortunately, some\r\n\r\nmisinformed  persons,  including  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong,   take   up  their  cause  without   first\r\n\r\nexamining  the  issues involved.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong  complained that the new abattoir  was  not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  Singapore  and  that  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nslaughter  is  much slower than that  of  the  old\r\n\r\nabattoir.  I  wonder  if he has  visited  the  new\r\n\r\nabattoir  and the old one to see for  himself  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  working conditions! He is well  advised\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  visit to these places if  he  has  not\r\n\r\nalready done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the design and construction\r\n\r\nof  the new abattoir, which cost $5.8 million, are\r\n\r\nbased on modern technology and up-to-date concept.\r\n\r\nThe  same  type  of abattoir has been  in  use  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  the  U.S.A.,  Russia,  Japan  and  China.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  while the sheep and cattle sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  new abattoir are now operating smoothly,  the\r\n\r\npig section has not been started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machinery has been undergoing testing and\r\n\r\nnewly-recruited workers are undergoing training. I\r\n\r\ndo  not know from where the Member for Jurong  got\r\n\r\nhis idea that the new abattoir is inefficient even\r\n\r\nbefore  it  is put into full operation. Basically,\r\n\r\nit is simply a question of whether we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept new ideas and adopt new technology,  or\r\n\r\ncan  we  afford to stick to out-of-date  practices\r\n\r\nand stagnate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that when a new system is being\r\n\r\noperated and new machinery is being used, teething\r\n\r\ntroubles are inevitable. Like the running-in of  a\r\n\r\nnew car, a little time is required to get used  to\r\n\r\nthe  steering  wheel  or the  new  gadget  on  the\r\n\r\ndashboard.  The seat must be adjusted or  a  screw\r\n\r\ntightened. We welcome constructive suggestions and\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  discuss with anybody  any  real\r\n\r\nproblem and genuine grievances so that together we\r\n\r\ncan  work out solutions to the satisfaction of all\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have raised the question of\r\n\r\nsafeguarding our fishermen against piracy. This is\r\n\r\nnot   a   unique  problem  for  Singapore.  Piracy\r\n\r\nfrequently   occurs  in  the   waters   of   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  I have no doubt that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  are\r\n\r\ndoing  what they can to deal with this problem  to\r\n\r\nprotect Singapore's interest. Apart from the  fact\r\n\r\nthat there is less fish to be caught in near shore\r\n\r\nwaters  around  Singapore,  small  fishing   craft\r\n\r\noperating  in  these  waters  are  easy  prey  for\r\n\r\npirates.  My  Ministry  is  working  towards   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of bigger and faster fishing  vessels\r\n\r\nwhich could go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  out  to  sea  to  fish  in  international\r\n\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of prices for agricultural produce\r\n\r\nreally  depends  on supply and demand.  There  are\r\n\r\ndifferent and complex forces operating in  a  free\r\n\r\nmarket.  It would be unwise for the Government  to\r\n\r\ninterfere in a free marketing system unless  there\r\n\r\nis  evidence  of dumping. I do not know  what  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong had in mind when he raised  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  Singapore, being a  small  island,  has\r\n\r\neasy communication between the rural areas and the\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  the  city, and the producers  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas know the prevailing market prices  of\r\n\r\nagricultural  produce in the city.  Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  buyers or collectors  of  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce  is  large and compete very  keenly  among\r\n\r\nthemselves. Under these circumstances, it  is  not\r\n\r\nas easy for the middlemen to exploit the producers\r\n\r\nas  in  a situation where there are only very  few\r\n\r\ncollectors  of  agricultural  produce  in  remote,\r\n\r\nisolated  rural  districts. If a producer  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the prices, it is not  beyond  his\r\n\r\nability  to send his agricultural produce  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket  and  sell it himself. This,  in  fact,  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  Singapore. The producers  may  also\r\n\r\nform themselves into co-operatives or associations\r\n\r\nto  deal with their marketing problems. But, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  there  must  be co-operation  among  the\r\n\r\nproducers   themselves.   They   must   take   the\r\n\r\ninitiative and my Ministry will be very  happy  to\r\n\r\nhelp  any group of people who is willing  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, sports today is not merely recreation. It  is\r\n\r\ntoo  important for us to treat it as  such.  In  a\r\n\r\nway,  the sports arena has become another  testing\r\n\r\nground  for rival countries to try to score  \"one-up\"  against one another. For supremacy in  sports\r\n\r\nis  indication of potential power in other spheres\r\n\r\ntoo.  This is borne out by the fact that  the  two\r\n\r\nsuperpowers of the world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  also the leading nations in sports. It is not\r\n\r\na coincidence, to be sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just why is sports so important that we should\r\n\r\nhave a separate division in the Ministry of Social\r\n\r\nAffairs to look after it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is one of the best ways of\r\n\r\ninculcating  intrinsic values such as  initiative,\r\n\r\nperseverance, agility, endurance, courage and team-spirit in our younger generation. We want all  our\r\n\r\nyouths  to  possess  these  qualities  which   are\r\n\r\nessential  for  our national survival.  To  ensure\r\n\r\nthis,  all activities in sports should be properly\r\n\r\nco-ordinated and guided, and hence the setting  up\r\n\r\nof the Sports Division is the first pre-requisite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also realise that sports can play a\r\n\r\nuseful  role in uniformed organisations,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe Armed Forces, the Police, the Vigilante Corps,\r\n\r\nas  well  as the multifarious voluntary  uniformed\r\n\r\nyouth movements, if it is properly introduced, not\r\n\r\njust  as a recreation, but as a basic part of  the\r\n\r\ntraining programme. For the training of all  these\r\n\r\nyoung people, the various games serve to diversify\r\n\r\nthe pattern of training within the units. Although\r\n\r\nuniformity  is an essential feature  in  uniformed\r\n\r\norganisations,  the  introduction   of   different\r\n\r\nsports  does  help to give the joy of variety  and\r\n\r\nshow  these young people that there is also  scope\r\n\r\nfor   individual  differences  apart  from   group\r\n\r\nsimilarities.  This does not, however,  mean  that\r\n\r\nindividual  interests should supersede  the  group\r\n\r\ninterests,  but rather that the former  should  be\r\n\r\nused for the promotion of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, sports can help to inculcate a sense of\r\n\r\ndedication   and  loyalty  to  the   nation.   The\r\n\r\nsportsman is taught to be dedicated and  loyal  to\r\n\r\nhis  team.  This  is  his first  lesson.  When  he\r\n\r\nrepresents  the national team, his dedication  and\r\n\r\nloyalty   is   therefore   to   the   nation.   As\r\n\r\nrepresenting the nation is the highest honour  any\r\n\r\nsportsman can hope for, he will be constantly  and\r\n\r\nconsciously  striving  for this  rare  honour  and\r\n\r\nglory. Hence, the process of training and striving\r\n\r\nfor  a  higher  plane  of achievement  is  also  a\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of dedication and  loyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, sports provide training in leadership.\r\n\r\nAs  a nation whose survival depends on the quality\r\n\r\nof  her  people, we need to have leaders  who  can\r\n\r\norganise,  think  and inspire others  to  give  of\r\n\r\ntheir best. It is my belief that such leaders  can\r\n\r\nbe  trained  and produced in the field of  sports,\r\n\r\nespecially  if they are directly involved  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration  and  organisation  of  any  sports\r\n\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to make is that, through\r\n\r\nsports,  we  can help to build a united  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  transcends  the  religious,  language   and\r\n\r\ncommunal barriers. It is our declared intention to\r\n\r\nharness  this important aspect of sports. We  have\r\n\r\nin  the  past  expressed our disavowal  of  sports\r\n\r\nclubs  organised  solely on a clannish  or  racial\r\n\r\nbasis. We appreciate the need for a certain amount\r\n\r\nof   exclusiveness  in  a  club,  but   let   this\r\n\r\nexclusiveness  be  not  on  clannish   or   racial\r\n\r\ngrounds.   The  constitutions  of  the  registered\r\n\r\nsports bodies do not provide for exclusiveness and\r\n\r\nhence  the  policy of many clubs  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nmembership and membership drive should be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is too much confinement\r\n\r\nof  certain  sports to certain  racial  groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is even apparent in the  different\r\n\r\ngames  played in the schools of different language\r\n\r\nstreams.  For example, the Chinese school students\r\n\r\nexcel  in  basketball, the Malay schools in  sepak\r\n\r\nraga and the Tamil students in cricket and hockey.\r\n\r\nThis  tendency of \"preferential confinement\"  must\r\n\r\nbe  stopped  if  we are to produce  a  homogeneous\r\n\r\ngeneration   as  regards  outlook,  interest   and\r\n\r\nidentity.  Apart from this, integration of  sports\r\n\r\nactivities  among  the  different  races  of   our\r\n\r\nsociety also ensures that talent in every game can\r\n\r\nbe  easily  spotted, for one can never be  certain\r\n\r\nthat  a  Malay cannot be a good basketball player,\r\n\r\nor a Chinese a good sepak raga player.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to touch on our image in the\r\n\r\nfield  of  international sports. Frankly speaking,\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  yet found a place  on  the  map  of\r\n\r\ninternational sports, and we are very  far  behind\r\n\r\nin the scene of Asian sports. However, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  compare  favourably  with  our  neighbours  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, as our success in the recent  SEAP\r\n\r\ngames testifies. This is a good start anyway for a\r\n\r\nsmall  and newly independent nation. Here, I  must\r\n\r\nmention that our success in the SEAP games was due\r\n\r\nto  the  timely  formation of the National  Sports\r\n\r\nControl  Board, which has already won praise  from\r\n\r\nall quarters, both at home and abroad. By adhering\r\n\r\nstrictly  to  the  policy of  sending  only  those\r\n\r\nathletes  who  have reached the  minimum  standard\r\n\r\nrequirements  for international meets,  the  Board\r\n\r\nhas  been able to ensure a degree of success which\r\n\r\nis  in proportion to the size of the contingent as\r\n\r\nwell as the amount of money expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned earlier that the sports arena\r\n\r\nhas  become the focal point of all nations.  Hence\r\n\r\nwe should also try to build up a good image in the\r\n\r\narena  of  international sports, for  our  friends\r\n\r\nabroad measure us as a nation by the behaviour and\r\n\r\nconduct of our sports representatives. It is clear\r\n\r\nthat few people would like to trade with a country\r\n\r\nwhich  produces  ill-mannered sportsmen.  However,\r\n\r\nour policy on international sports should be based\r\n\r\non  quality  and  integrity rather than  quantity.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also  cheaper and within  the  financial\r\n\r\nresources of a small nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, 1 should like to stress that\r\n\r\norganised  sports  is indeed very  expensive.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing all it can to help  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  sports in the Republic.  The  Sports\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the Ministry of Social  Affairs  has\r\n\r\nhelped to raise very substantial amounts of  money\r\n\r\nto  send  national  teams  abroad  to  compete  in\r\n\r\ninternational  meets.  Professional  coaches  have\r\n\r\nalso been employed to help raise the standards  of\r\n\r\nsoccer,  basketball  and badminton.  More  coaches\r\n\r\nwill  be  brought  in  for other  games  as  well.\r\n\r\nHowever, with its enormous commitments to defence,\r\n\r\neducation, health and social welfare, there  is  a\r\n\r\nlimit  to  which the Government can  help.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  imperative that the help and assistance\r\n\r\nthat sports-lovers, philanthropists and commercial\r\n\r\nfirms have been giving for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe promotion of sports in the Republic should  be\r\n\r\nfurther  increased. For it is only through all-out\r\n\r\nsupport  from all fronts that we can ever hope  to\r\n\r\nput Singapore on the map of international sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nhas  asked  about public assistance given  by  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department and has suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe  rates  of assistance be raised. Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill surely realise that since the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  Government came to power in June 1959,  the\r\n\r\nrates  of  public assistance have  been  increased\r\n\r\ntwice.  The  first increase was in September  1959\r\n\r\nwhen the rate paid to the head of a household  was\r\n\r\nincreased  from $15 to $16 a month  and  the  wife\r\n\r\nfrom  $8  to $10 a month. The second increase  was\r\n\r\nmade  in  January  1962 when the  rate  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance was increased further from $16 to $21 a\r\n\r\nmonth.  The  present public assistance  rates  for\r\n\r\nfamilies eligible under this plan are as follows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                            Per month\r\n\r\n                                            \r\n\r\n         Head of household                     $21\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n         Wife                                  $10\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n         Every dependant above\r\n\r\n           the age of 16 years                  $8\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n         Every dependant under\r\n\r\n           the age of 16 years                  $5\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As these rates are the highest in this part of the\r\n\r\nworld, there is no intention to increase these\r\n\r\nrates any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By increasing the public assistance rates, which\r\n\r\nis  not  in  the interest of taxpayers, recipients\r\n\r\nwill   be  encouraged  to  rely  forever  on  this\r\n\r\nassistance.  This will defeat the purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nassistance  which  is aimed at  giving  relief  to\r\n\r\nthose who are unemployed, and with dependants,  to\r\n\r\novercome  their difficulties for a limited  period\r\n\r\nonly  until they secure employment. Last year  the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaid  out  $7.6 million for public assistance  and\r\n\r\nT.B, relief. This is slightly more than  half  of\r\n\r\nthe  amount allocated, which is $14 million  under\r\n\r\nthe   estimates   for  departmental   expenditure.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  any  increase in the rates  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  will  bring about an increase  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance votes and this will leave  less\r\n\r\nmoney  to  be  spent on other responsibilities  in\r\n\r\nwelfare services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that public assistance recipients will\r\n\r\nnot rely permanently on this assistance, a special\r\n\r\nteam  was formed in April 1964 with the object  of\r\n\r\ncarrying out investigations from time to time  and\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  financial  position  of   families\r\n\r\nreceiving assistance. As a result of work  carried\r\n\r\nout  by  this special team and the improvement  in\r\n\r\nour   social  conditions  and  economic   position\r\n\r\nbrought  about by Government's long-term planning,\r\n\r\nthe  number of recipients of public assistance has\r\n\r\nconsiderably  been reduced from  28,800  in  April\r\n\r\n1964 to 17,000 only in April 1968. The amount paid\r\n\r\nfor  public  assistance has  also  decreased  from\r\n\r\n$962,000 in April 1964 to $492,000 in April 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also referred to training\r\n\r\nallowances received by dependants of recipients of\r\n\r\npublic assistance who are serving in the national\r\n\r\nservice. A dependant of a recipient of public\r\n\r\nassistance is allowed to keep his training\r\n\r\nallowance, up to an amount of $25. Any amount in\r\n\r\nexcess of this will be considered when public\r\n\r\nassistance to his head of household is reviewed.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is appropriate that if a dependant is in\r\n\r\nreceipt of a military training allowance, he will\r\n\r\nnot be eligible for a dependant allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the representative for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru, I would like to express my full support for\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's motion thanking the President\r\n\r\nfor  his speech delivered in this House on the 6th\r\n\r\nof  May.  The President's policy statement clearly\r\n\r\npoints out that the Government will have to  adopt\r\n\r\neffective measures to meet the problems that  will\r\n\r\narise in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  situation  in the next five  years.  We  have\r\n\r\nreason   to  believe  that  with  its  experience,\r\n\r\nachievements and capacity to resolve  problems  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  nine  years,  the  present  Government,\r\n\r\ntogether with all the Members of Parliament,  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  find ways and means to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nthree  objectives as outlined in  the  President's\r\n\r\nSpeech, and we are confident that it will overcome\r\n\r\nall difficulties and challenges. The first and the\r\n\r\nsecond  objectives relate to defence and  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   Members  of  Parliament   have   already\r\n\r\nexpressed their views on them. So I will now touch\r\n\r\non the third objective, namely, the enhancement of\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness of the problems that  will\r\n\r\ncome upon us in the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the political situation in our\r\n\r\ncountry   has  been  changing.  Before  1954,   we\r\n\r\nexperienced  a  period of colonial administration.\r\n\r\nIn  1959,  Singapore  achieved a  self-independent\r\n\r\nstatus  and later on it joined Malaysia. In  1965,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was separated from Malaysia and  became\r\n\r\nan  independent  Republic.  These  were  political\r\n\r\nchanges  in  our history and, in the same  period,\r\n\r\nthere were changes too on the international scene.\r\n\r\nWe,  as  citizens  of Singapore,  should  pay  the\r\n\r\nclosest  attention to these changes as there  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  changes in this region in three to  five\r\n\r\nyears'  time. No one can be sure of whether  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  any drastic changes around us  going  to\r\n\r\ntake  place.  So in the coming crucial  years,  we\r\n\r\nmust  avail  ourselves  of  every  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nensure  our independence and survival. This  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  should  perceive.  In  particular,  those\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  who  are in charge  of  executing\r\n\r\nGovernment policies, should pay more attention  at\r\n\r\nall  times  to the actual spirit of the Ordinances\r\n\r\nand  Acts.  It is in that spirit that they  should\r\n\r\nfaithfully carry out the policies laid down.  They\r\n\r\nshould  also  discard  their  rigid  and  dogmatic\r\n\r\nattitude   in   their   work.   Otherwise    their\r\n\r\ninflexibility   will   usually   give   rise    to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding   of  their  disregard   of   the\r\n\r\npurposes  and actual spirit of the Ordinances  and\r\n\r\nActs.  Unnecessary explanation will have time  and\r\n\r\nagain to be repeated. In this way, efficiency in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  administration  of the Ordinances  and  Acts\r\n\r\nwill be affected and the purposes may not be fully\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for instance, early this year,\r\n\r\nthe   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee   of   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  made a request to the  General  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  to  install a post-box  in  Jalan  Membina\r\n\r\nHousing  Estate, which was recently  developed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board. In view of the\r\n\r\nfact that there are now about 20,000 residents  in\r\n\r\nthis area, the installation of a post-box was very\r\n\r\nnecessary. But the request was turned down on  the\r\n\r\nground  that  no  new post-box should  be  set  up\r\n\r\nwithin  a radius of one mile from any branch  post\r\n\r\noffice.  In  the old neighbouring housing  estate,\r\n\r\nthere is a branch post office and a post-box.  But\r\n\r\nI  would like to point out that there is no direct\r\n\r\ncommunication  with this housing  estate.  So  the\r\n\r\nbranch  post  office is not of  much  use  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents of Jalan Membina. At the request of  the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committee, I went  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Post  Office  and,  after  studying   the\r\n\r\nproblem  with  the  officer  concerned,   it   was\r\n\r\nrealised  that the problem could easily be  solved\r\n\r\nby  removing  one pillar post-box  from  Henderson\r\n\r\nRoad to the entrance to Jalan Membina without  any\r\n\r\ncost,  because  the pillar post-box  in  Henderson\r\n\r\nRoad  was  not  being used very much  -  about  20\r\n\r\nletters  a day were thrown into it. When this  was\r\n\r\ndone,  it  benefited the people  living  in  Jalan\r\n\r\nMembina  and  also in Bukit Ho  Swee.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ntrivial  matter but it goes to show  that  if  the\r\n\r\nofficer concerned had given further thought to it,\r\n\r\nmuch time and trouble would have been saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention another incident.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the eviction of a tenant of  a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flat. The Members for Jurong and Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nquoted  the case of a coffee-shop owner  in  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru who committed suicide by jumping down from a\r\n\r\nmulti-storeyed  flat. They spoke in  a  forthright\r\n\r\nmanner  and  with a sense of justice. However,  we\r\n\r\nknow  from  the Press that the housing authorities\r\n\r\nare  giving sympathetic consideration to this case\r\n\r\nand I hope that there will be a reasonable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolution.  Therefore, I will not dwell further  on\r\n\r\nthis  case.  But 1 would like to quote  a  similar\r\n\r\ncase of an old lady occupying a Housing Board flat\r\n\r\nwho  was  asked  to  vacate because  a  number  of\r\n\r\nteenagers were found playing mahjong in her  flat.\r\n\r\nShe  went  to  the  Housing Board authorities  and\r\n\r\npleaded  for  another chance.  She  threatened  to\r\n\r\ncommit  suicide  by  jumping down  from  a  multi-storeyed flat if her plea was not heeded. But  she\r\n\r\nwas met by a very rigid and harsh officer - though\r\n\r\na  good  officer - who was not moved by her tears.\r\n\r\nHe told her, \"It is no business of mine whether or\r\n\r\nnot you jump down from your flat, but you have  to\r\n\r\nquit?'  Sir, I agree in principle with the  strict\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  against  flats  being  used   for\r\n\r\nillegal purposes, but eviction is the most  severe\r\n\r\nmeasure that can be taken by the Housing Board. If\r\n\r\nthe  premises  are used as gambling  dens  or  for\r\n\r\nother ignominious or illegal purposes, eviction is\r\n\r\njustified.  But,  Sir, those youngsters  who  were\r\n\r\nfound  playing  mahjong are the old neighbours  of\r\n\r\nthe  old lady. They were playing mahjong just  for\r\n\r\nthe  fun  of it. This old lady who was accused  of\r\n\r\nallowing  her premises to be used by a  number  of\r\n\r\nyoungsters for mahjong, it was found that she  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  even  a  proper mahjong  table  in  her\r\n\r\npremises.  This  would  show  that  she   had   no\r\n\r\nintention of turning her premises into a  gambling\r\n\r\nden.  The  playing of mahjong in a  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat  should be regarded as a very minor  offence.\r\n\r\nSo we should have compassion on this old lady, who\r\n\r\ncommitted   the  first  offence.  The  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned did not even give her another chance  or\r\n\r\na  first  warning. Was it not very harsh treatment\r\n\r\nof the old lady who was asked to remove?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the illustrations given, we can see what\r\n\r\nsort  of  attitude civil servants have. They  lack\r\n\r\npatience to look into and study complaints by  the\r\n\r\npublic.  They should be more aware of the problems\r\n\r\nlying  ahead of our nation. They should  also  re-examine  the  attitude that they have  adopted  in\r\n\r\ntheir  work and towards members of the public.  If\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstick foolishly to their daily routine, they  will\r\n\r\nfail  in  their responsibilities and in trying  to\r\n\r\nsolve the national problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of defence, my\r\n\r\nview  is that, in addition to giving our nationals\r\n\r\nmilitary training and teaching them how to  handle\r\n\r\nmilitary  equipment, we should teach  them  to  be\r\n\r\npatriotic, particularly as Singapore has  attained\r\n\r\nits  independence only not long ago.  We  can  see\r\n\r\nvery  clearly,  from history - even  recently,  in\r\n\r\nfact  - that in the struggle for survival,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot so much the military equipment that matters as\r\n\r\nthe ideological training - given to the people. In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  I  feel that we should  teach  our\r\n\r\npeople to be patriotic. This will spur them on  to\r\n\r\nmake personal sacrifices in the national interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in  addition to instruction  given  in\r\n\r\nmilitary training and teaching our soldiers how to\r\n\r\nuse  their  weapons, we should teach  them  to  be\r\n\r\npatriotic so that they will be able to  put  up  a\r\n\r\nbetter performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to make the people\r\n\r\nmore  aware  of  the problems that will  face  our\r\n\r\nnation  in  the next few years, our  teachers  too\r\n\r\nmust  be  made  conscious of  these  problems.  We\r\n\r\ndescribe  teachers as engineers of the  soul,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  a very apt description of the importance\r\n\r\nof  the  role  they play. So it is necessary  that\r\n\r\nthey  should be conscious of the problems that  we\r\n\r\nare  now facing, because they are charged with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of educating our younger generation\r\n\r\nwho will provide our future leadership. Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  students should be given proper  guidance  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  a  sense  of  patriotism  and  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  The  teachers  should  strive  for\r\n\r\nimprovement  all the time in order  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nqualitative aspects of our education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a saying, \"What is\r\n\r\ndyed black will be black and what is dyed red will\r\n\r\nbe  red.\" So the kind of young people we will have\r\n\r\nin  future  will depend on the sort  of  education\r\n\r\nthat  we  now give them. At the present moment  we\r\n\r\nare  stepping  up  extra-mural activities  in  the\r\n\r\nschools, but the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  spent on them by the teachers is inadequate.\r\n\r\nI  hope  our  teachers will devote more  time  and\r\n\r\nenergy to their students' extramural activities so\r\n\r\nas  to produce a robust and rugged society in  our\r\n\r\nnext generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to inculcate a spirit\r\n\r\nof national consciousness in the students, we have\r\n\r\nmilitary  and police training in the cadet  corps.\r\n\r\nWe  should not have quantity alone. We should also\r\n\r\nhave  quality  in  our  training.  We  should   be\r\n\r\nconcerned not so much with the form but  with  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of  the  training we are  giving  to  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  In my view, our youth must realise  the\r\n\r\nimportance of national consciousness. It  is  only\r\n\r\nwith the spur of patriotism that our children will\r\n\r\nbe able to build a robust and rugged society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Ministry of Culture has a great\r\n\r\npart to play in the field of public education. For\r\n\r\nexample, the contents of the television and  radio\r\n\r\nbroadcasts   must   be   imbued   with    national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  The publications in  our  National\r\n\r\nLibrary  and  the exhibits in the National  Museum\r\n\r\nshould also have items which will inspire national\r\n\r\nconsciousness and patriotism. It is only when  our\r\n\r\npeople  have the feeling of patriotism  that  they\r\n\r\nwill be able to solve all problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have also noted that only ten per\r\n\r\ncent  of the school population per year reach  the\r\n\r\nmatriculation level, and of this figure only about\r\n\r\nfive per cent are admitted to the universities  or\r\n\r\nother   institutions  of  higher  learning.  These\r\n\r\nundergraduates   are  in  a  somewhat   privileged\r\n\r\nposition.   They  receive  special  training   and\r\n\r\neducation.  Naturally after  they  have  graduated\r\n\r\nthey  should be able to serve their country better\r\n\r\nby  solving  our national problems and  overcoming\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  and  making a concerted  effort  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a more prosperous multi-racial society.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has said in moving the motion,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  what it is today  because  we  have\r\n\r\nabove average intelligence, diligence, skill, know-how and expertise. Undoubtedly, our graduates have\r\n\r\nthe  honour of being in possession of such  talent\r\n\r\nand expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  from what we can see at the present juncture,\r\n\r\nthere  are certain disappointing features  amongst\r\n\r\nour graduates. Some of them are still living in an\r\n\r\nivory  tower.  They are least concerned  with  our\r\n\r\nnational affairs. Today if we try to get graduates\r\n\r\nwho  are really interested in our national affairs\r\n\r\nand  are dedicated to our country, I am afraid the\r\n\r\nnumber will not be very great. In fact, we can see\r\n\r\nvery  few  graduates  serving  on  the  management\r\n\r\ncommittees  of the various community  centres  and\r\n\r\nthe Citizens' Consultative Committees. In my view,\r\n\r\nwhile we are reorganising our secondary education,\r\n\r\nwe   should   also   consider   reorganising   our\r\n\r\nuniversities. We should then be able to produce  a\r\n\r\ngeneration   of  graduates  who   are   not   only\r\n\r\nspecialists  in their field, but are  also  imbued\r\n\r\nwith   a  sense  of  national  consciousness   and\r\n\r\npatriotism  so  that  they would  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndedicate themselves to society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish now to touch on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  adult  education.  At  the   present\r\n\r\nmoment,  the Adult Education Board is running  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  classes, the language classes  and  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  evening classes. All these classes  are\r\n\r\nbiased towards academic subjects. Now that we  are\r\n\r\nindustrialising  and  are  trying   to   introduce\r\n\r\ntechnical  subjects into our education system,  we\r\n\r\nsee that the work of the Adult Education Board  is\r\n\r\nnot  adequate  in  this  respect.  The  Board   is\r\n\r\nfinanced by public funds and the students  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  are either young workers or people who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to get places in schools. In my view,  the\r\n\r\nadult   education   classes  should   teach   more\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  vocational subjects than  academic\r\n\r\nsubjects.  In this way the graduates of the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board will be able to play their part in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. In the day-time they  have  got\r\n\r\ntheir  own  jobs.  Two  or  three  years  ago,   I\r\n\r\nunderstood that these part-time teachers would  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by full-time teachers. But I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhy  this has not been done. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be  denied that the Adult Education  Board\r\n\r\nhas made outstanding achievements in the field  of\r\n\r\nadult education. But in order to consolidate  what\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved and to fall in with the  change  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  education,  the Adult  Education  Board\r\n\r\nmust have its own staff of teachers. This will not\r\n\r\nonly help to promote the growth of adult education\r\n\r\nbut  it  will  also help to solve our unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last week when the Member for\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat  spoke in this House, he advocated  the\r\n\r\nabolition  of communal schools and the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Chai Chee yesterday also voiced the  same\r\n\r\nopinion  in support. I fully agree with what  that\r\n\r\nthey have said. In order to create a society and a\r\n\r\nnation which transcends all racial differences, we\r\n\r\nmust  make a start in this respect in the schools.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do not agree when they say that there  are\r\n\r\ncommunal  schools in our Republic. At present  the\r\n\r\nschools,  in  whatever stream  they  are,  do  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate   against  any  student   on   racial\r\n\r\ngrounds.  It is possible for a Tamil to  go  to  a\r\n\r\nChinese  school to study and for a Chinese student\r\n\r\nto  go to a Malay school to study. However,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot deny that in the Republic parents tend to send\r\n\r\ntheir  children  to the schools  where  their  own\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  is  being used as  the  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction. This is mainly due to the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe policy of second language teaching has got  to\r\n\r\nbe  more practical and its implementation has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  adequate.  That  is why  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying to improve the standard of teaching of  the\r\n\r\nsecond language in all schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the President's Speech various\r\n\r\neffective  measures  have  been  clearly  outlined\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government will adopt to put the second\r\n\r\nlanguage to maximum use as a medium of instruction\r\n\r\nin  our schools. This is to enable our students to\r\n\r\nbecome  bilingual  so  that they  will  have  more\r\n\r\nopportunities    for   further    education    and\r\n\r\nemployment.  It is only through the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nbilingualism  in our schools that it  is  possible\r\n\r\nfor  the  students  to  break  down  the  language\r\n\r\nbarrier  and  thus be able to mix together,  study\r\n\r\ntogether and live together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, let us strengthen our administrative\r\n\r\narm  and  achieve the great objective  of  nation-building. According to the speech delivered by the\r\n\r\nPresident,  it is obvious that the Government  has\r\n\r\nadopted various measures to deal effectively  with\r\n\r\nthe  problems that are confronting us. I now fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  motion  in the  name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I deal with one or two\r\n\r\naspects  of the policy of my Ministry as  outlined\r\n\r\nin  the  Addendum  to the President's  Speech  and\r\n\r\nelaborate on them and perhaps reply to some points\r\n\r\nraised by some hon. Members in this debate, I wish\r\n\r\nto  speak  on  the  present cholera  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I am sure hon. Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nwill be keen to hear me on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four cholera-free years, a single case of\r\n\r\ncholera was discovered on the 17th of April, 1968,\r\n\r\nin  a 66-year old male Chinese who lives at Lorong\r\n\r\n3,  Geylang. Hon. Members will remember  that  the\r\n\r\n17th of April, 1968, is only a day after I assumed\r\n\r\noffice   as   Minister   for   Health.   To    the\r\n\r\nsuperstitious minded, this may be an  omen  or  an\r\n\r\naugury  perhaps  ill  or good,  depending  on  the\r\n\r\nstars,  of  the things to come during my  term  of\r\n\r\noffice  as Minister for Health. Perhaps  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  who is  an  expert  in  these\r\n\r\nmatters, can tell us what the stars foretell.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for myself and my Ministry, we  look\r\n\r\nat  this in the light of cold logic as a challenge\r\n\r\nthat  lies ahead of us to wrestle out a successful\r\n\r\nsolution  not only of making Singapore  clean  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  maintain  it as such.  Dirt,  flies  and\r\n\r\nmosquitoes are all too evident and we do not  need\r\n\r\nhon. Members or members of the public to remind us\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although to date there are four\r\n\r\ncases  of  cholera, I wish to assure hon.  Members\r\n\r\nthat there is no cause for alarm. The position  is\r\n\r\nunder  control. My officials tell  me  that  after\r\n\r\nstudying  the pattern of the outbreak, an epidemic\r\n\r\nspread of the disease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  most  unlikely. However, to ensure that  this\r\n\r\ndoes  not  occur at all, stringent  measures  have\r\n\r\nalready been taken in and around the places  where\r\n\r\nthe four cases have occurred. Of course, for these\r\n\r\nmeasures  to be effective we need the maximum  co-operation of the members of the public who live in\r\n\r\neach  such  area. In this respect hon. Members  in\r\n\r\nwhose constituencies these areas happen to be  can\r\n\r\ndo  a  lot to set the lead. The residents in these\r\n\r\nareas  need to be advised that there is  no  cause\r\n\r\nfor alarm so long as they scrupulously observe the\r\n\r\nsimple  rules  of hygiene of washing  their  hands\r\n\r\nbefore  they  handle any eatables,  boiling  water\r\n\r\nbefore they drink it, washing any cut fruit  which\r\n\r\nhad been left exposed before eating it and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now give hon. Members\r\n\r\nsome facts concerning the outbreak. The four cases\r\n\r\nof cholera have occurred in four different places.\r\n\r\nThey are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case occurred on 17-4-68 to a 66-year\r\n\r\nold  odd  job  wood-worker  living  at  Lorong  3,\r\n\r\nGeylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second case on 4-5-68 to a 39-year old store-keeper with the Port of Singapore Authority living\r\n\r\nat Jalan Minggu (Thomson Road Estate).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third case on 6-5-68 to a 9-year old school\r\n\r\nboy living at Peng Ghee Road, Kampong Chai Chee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth case on 7-5-68 to a 68-year old car\r\n\r\nwasher living at Verdun Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All patients have recovered. The pattern of the\r\n\r\noutbreak   has  similarities  with  the   previous\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  1963 - 1964. There was  initially  a\r\n\r\nlatent  period between the first case  before  the\r\n\r\nothers occurred. All were isolated cases: no  link\r\n\r\nwas discovered between any one of the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bacterial strain of the present outbreak is El\r\n\r\nTor Inaba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common feature is the attack on the old and\r\n\r\ninsanitary living conditions of the patients.  But\r\n\r\nthe  small number of cases and the lack of a  link\r\n\r\nbetween cases rule out water-borne infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed,  it  is  unlikely that the  disease  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  into  any  proportions  because  of   our\r\n\r\nextensive   safe   water  supply.   The   sporadic\r\n\r\noccurrence without a detectable pattern  indicates\r\n\r\nthe transmission by carriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is fortunate that the outbreaks will not\r\n\r\nbe   of  epidemic  proportions  the  presence   of\r\n\r\ncarriers  (none detected in the present  outbreak)\r\n\r\nmeans  that  small outbreaks of the  disease  will\r\n\r\noccur  sporadically indicating the endemic  state.\r\n\r\nEradication  in  the  circumstances  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also stress the important fact that\r\n\r\nSingapore is an open international port. Every day\r\n\r\nthousands  of people come in and out of  Singapore\r\n\r\nnot  only from the surrounding areas but also from\r\n\r\nevery nook and corner of the world. I am told that\r\n\r\nanother great port, the port of Rotterdam, has its\r\n\r\noccasional outbreaks of cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Singapore, as hon. Members know, is\r\n\r\nan  extremely attractive and desirable  place  for\r\n\r\npeople  of  the surrounding economically depressed\r\n\r\nareas to come to and, if possible, to settle  down\r\n\r\nin. Our immigration authorities have been hard put\r\n\r\nto  it to deal with the ever-increasing number  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants into Singapore. I am told  that\r\n\r\nin  recent months some 300 illegal immigrants  had\r\n\r\nto  be deported back to the place where they  came\r\n\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Fair\r\n\r\nenough!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> But what about the unknown\r\n\r\nnumber who have managed to slip in undetected?  We\r\n\r\ncan therefore expect quite a number of carriers of\r\n\r\nthe cholera bacteria to have come into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant authorities in my Ministry have been\r\n\r\nkeeping a strict check on the international health\r\n\r\ncertificates  of every traveller that  comes  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But whom we have no control  over  are\r\n\r\nthe  illegal  immigrants that have  been  slipping\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore.  However, I assure  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nthat  strict vigilance will be maintained. In  the\r\n\r\nlong term, eradication of the disease can only be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved  if the people are scrupulously clean  in\r\n\r\ntheir  habits  and the standard of  sanitation  is\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure a question which is uppermost in the\r\n\r\nminds  of  hon.  Members is the question  of  mass\r\n\r\ninoculation  of the whole population of  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  measure of control, and whether my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be  launching  such  a  mass  campaign.   My\r\n\r\nofficials   and  I  have  considered   this   very\r\n\r\ncarefully  and we have decided that the  situation\r\n\r\nat the moment does not warrant such a measure. The\r\n\r\nreasons for our decision are as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, although inoculation is one of the\r\n\r\nmeasures of control, it is of minor importance  in\r\n\r\nendemic outbreaks. The present outbreak is a small\r\n\r\none  and  represents an endemic  situation  rather\r\n\r\nthan a build-up towards an epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the vaccination confers at best\r\n\r\nimmunity of short duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the cost for the inoculation of our two\r\n\r\nmillion population will be high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, such a mass inoculation campaign will\r\n\r\nrequire   the   turning  of  all  our   outpatient\r\n\r\ndispensaries and maternal and child health centres\r\n\r\ninto  vaccination centres, and this  will  involve\r\n\r\nnot  only the posting of additional staff to these\r\n\r\ncentres   but  also  the  curtailment  of  routine\r\n\r\nmedical  services  in  these  centres  during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the campaign, which will take at  least\r\n\r\none to two months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there are complications following\r\n\r\nvaccination.  The serious one is  serum  jaundice.\r\n\r\nEven  at  a  very small rate of incidence  in  the\r\n\r\nmass,  the total number who will succumb  to  this\r\n\r\ninfection would be significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation will be carefully watched.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, may I assure hon. Members  that  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   is   ready  to  launch  such   a   mass\r\n\r\ninoculation campaign in the unlikely event of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  meriting it. We have at the  moment  in\r\n\r\nstock  nearly  one million doses  of  anti-cholera\r\n\r\nvaccine  and this can be easily increased  by  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing some more if we so require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, vaccination to date has been offered\r\n\r\nonly because it is required for travellers outside\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  For this purpose, the  vaccination\r\n\r\ncentre  at  North Canal Road has been enlarged  to\r\n\r\ndeaf with the additional persons attending at  the\r\n\r\ncentre.  The Airport Centre deals with  passengers\r\n\r\nleaving  Singapore who might have  missed  getting\r\n\r\nvaccination certificates before take-off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the third case the Director of Medical\r\n\r\nServices,  Malaysia, indicated that more stringent\r\n\r\nmeasures might be taken for travellers across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.   The   Malaysian   health   authorities\r\n\r\nvaccinate   every  person  coming  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nunless  they  have valid vaccination certificates.\r\n\r\nThis  has  imposed a strain on their services  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  running short of supplies and they  had\r\n\r\nindicated   that  they  might  either  turn   back\r\n\r\ntravellers     arriving    without     vaccination\r\n\r\ncertificates  or quarantine them on  arrival.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason a third centre was opened  at  Kranji\r\n\r\nMaternal   and  Child  Health  Centre  (l3\u00bd   m.s.\r\n\r\nWoodlands just south of the Causeway). The  number\r\n\r\nof  attendances  at this centre  is  small,  which\r\n\r\nprobably indicates that the majority of travellers\r\n\r\nhave   already   been   vaccinated   and   possess\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not proposed, however, to set up a centre\r\n\r\nat  the  railway station. From experience  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  outbreak, railway travellers came just about\r\n\r\ntime  for  boarding the train and expected  to  be\r\n\r\nvaccinated. Since everybody had the same idea, the\r\n\r\nrush  created unruly scenes. Passengers travelling\r\n\r\nby train should, therefore, take their vaccination\r\n\r\nfrom  the  North Canal Road centre  in  good  time\r\n\r\nbefore travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to elaborate on\r\n\r\none or two aspects of the policy of my Ministry as\r\n\r\noutlined   in  the  Addendum  to  the  President's\r\n\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, with this outbreak of cholera,\r\n\r\nthe  environmental aspect of health has become the\r\n\r\nmore  pressing  problem.  It  is  a  very  complex\r\n\r\nproblem   particularly  because  the  people   are\r\n\r\ninvolved. To tackle this problem successfully,  an\r\n\r\naggressive   and  concerted  planned   effort   is\r\n\r\nnecessary. The plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust involve the mass participation of the public.\r\n\r\nIt  is  true that our cleansing services and Anti-Mosquito  Unit  need  further re-organisation  for\r\n\r\nbetter   efficiency  and  discipline.  All   these\r\n\r\nefforts,  however, can come to naught  if  certain\r\n\r\nsections of the public continue with the  old  bad\r\n\r\nhabits  of  indiscriminate throwing of litter  and\r\n\r\nrubbish and allowing their little children to  use\r\n\r\nour public drains as a place for the evacuation of\r\n\r\ntheir   bowels  while  others  continue  to  breed\r\n\r\nmosquitoes in discarded empty receptacles  in  the\r\n\r\ncompounds  of their houses. Therefore, along  with\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation of our public health  services\r\n\r\nto lick it into shape, it is necessary at the same\r\n\r\ntime  to  launch  a mass nation-wide  campaign  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the civic-mindedness of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  keep  Singapore  clean.  This  will\r\n\r\ninvolve   the   participation  of   thousands   of\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers who will be trained before  they\r\n\r\ngo  out  and exhort members of the public  not  to\r\n\r\nthrow  litter  and so on. In this  mass  campaign,\r\n\r\nwhich will have to be worked out very carefully, I\r\n\r\nshall  require not only the sympathetic  but  also\r\n\r\nthe active co-operation of hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only after this mass health education\r\n\r\ncampaign  that the new laws will be enforced  with\r\n\r\nvigour  to  deal firmly but fairly with the  small\r\n\r\npercentage   of   incorrigible   litter-bugs   and\r\n\r\npersistent  breeders  of disease-bearing  insects,\r\n\r\nlike mosquitoes and flies. These new laws are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  very carefully drafted, loopholes are being\r\n\r\nplugged in order to make for effective enforcement\r\n\r\nagainst the wrongdoer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cleansing side which is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  my  Ministry,  a  new roster  system  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to allow the cleansing, the collection\r\n\r\nand  disposal of rubbish to be done all  the  year\r\n\r\nround irrespective of Sundays and public holidays.\r\n\r\nA sustained effort with this two-pronged attack on\r\n\r\nthis  extremely difficult problem  should  see  us\r\n\r\nthrough to a cleaner and healthier Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other priority problem is the problem of\r\n\r\ndental health in Singapore. The poor dental health\r\n\r\nof our population was brought into focus when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  recruits of our national servicemen underwent\r\n\r\ndental examination. These young adults between the\r\n\r\nages of 18 and 21 years did not enjoy the benefits\r\n\r\nof   fluoridation  of  our  water  supplies  which\r\n\r\nstarted  in 1958. They had received little  or  no\r\n\r\ndental  attention from the school  dental  service\r\n\r\nwhile  they  were in the primary schools,  and  no\r\n\r\ndental  treatment other than extraction of decayed\r\n\r\nor  aching teeth during their adolescent years  in\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. Most of them do not visit their\r\n\r\ndentists   regularly  mainly  because   of   their\r\n\r\nignorance of dental hygiene. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  important  that our young population  maintain\r\n\r\ngood  dental  health because lack  of  good  sound\r\n\r\nteeth  can  greatly  handicap the  building  of  a\r\n\r\nrobust constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, to tackle the problem, my Ministry\r\n\r\nplaces  more emphasis on preventive measures,  not\r\n\r\nonly because they are financially less costly, but\r\n\r\nbecause they are based on the sound principle that\r\n\r\n\"Prevention is better than cure\". The first  thing\r\n\r\nthat we shall do will be to launch a Dental Health\r\n\r\nEducation   Programme.  This  will   be   directed\r\n\r\nparticularly  at  the  school  children.  A   more\r\n\r\nspecific  and active action plan must be  devised.\r\n\r\nFor  example, there should be compulsory  brushing\r\n\r\nof  teeth by school children as part of the school\r\n\r\ncurriculum after their physical training  classes.\r\n\r\nThis  brings me to mind a remark made by the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Katong who quite cynically said that it\r\n\r\nis  all very well to urge school children to brush\r\n\r\ntheir teeth -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong will agree with me that he did say that\r\n\r\nit  is  all  very well to urge school children  to\r\n\r\nbrush  their  teeth,  but what  about  those  poor\r\n\r\nchildren  who  do  not possess  a  toothbrush?  My\r\n\r\nanswer  to this is quite simple. Surely the parent\r\n\r\nof  every school-going child can afford to  buy  a\r\n\r\ntoothbrush in the same way as he can afford to buy\r\n\r\na pair of shoes, which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore expensive. I understand that toothbrushes, if\r\n\r\nbought  in  bulk, might be obtained  for  only  10\r\n\r\ncents  each, which hon. Members know is the  price\r\n\r\nof only a glass of ice-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, whatever preventive measures are\r\n\r\nundertaken,  there will remain a large  proportion\r\n\r\nof  the  population who missed  being  exposed  to\r\n\r\ndental  health  propaganda. For  these  people,  a\r\n\r\ndental  care service will be provided. The  dental\r\n\r\ncare  services  will  be expanded  as  rapidly  as\r\n\r\nresources are available. Priority will, of course,\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  the further establishment  of  more\r\n\r\ndental clinics for school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to deal with some of the points\r\n\r\nraised  by  hon.  Members in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to what the Member for Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nsaid in his usual picturesque manner and with some\r\n\r\nvehemence?  He did say some unkind things  of  the\r\n\r\nactions so far taken by the Hawkers Department  of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry.  He also suggested that  the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry should construct more markets and hawkers\r\n\r\nstalls  before they begin to resite  hawkers.  The\r\n\r\nHawkers Department of my Ministry has always  done\r\n\r\nits  best to provide alternative sites for hawkers\r\n\r\nwhen  clearing them, if such sites are  available.\r\n\r\nBut  as  hon. Members very well know, in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday,  such  vacant plots of  land  suitable  for\r\n\r\nhawker  resiting in the crowded areas of Singapore\r\n\r\nare  quite  difficult to come by. My  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ndoing  its  best to tackle the hawker  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, which hon.

The sacred and trojan task\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Government in  its  present  term  of\r\n\r\noffice  is  not  only to win the support  and  co-operation  of  the  people in a common  effort  to\r\n\r\nsurmount   the  difficult  defence  and   economic\r\n\r\nproblems  that  will  arise as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\npending  British withdrawal, but also to lead  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore towards a national  identity\r\n\r\nwhich is Singapore's own in form and content,  and\r\n\r\nto move from a society of migrant people to a deep-rooted  society, with a feeling of  attachment  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  a  sense  of  national  pride  and\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the difficult years ahead, while our\r\n\r\nattention will be focused on the problems and  our\r\n\r\nminds  will be diverted towards finding  solutions\r\n\r\nto  the problems, we must never lose sight of  our\r\n\r\nnational   perspective  and,  in  our  eager   and\r\n\r\naggressive  approach to solve our  problems,  find\r\n\r\ntemporary   solutions  that  would  create   other\r\n\r\nproblems for ourselves. While I would say that the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government  as  outlined  in  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech  and the  Addendum  to  it  is\r\n\r\npositive  and imaginative, and inspires confidence\r\n\r\nand sparks off a radiant ray of hope in our people\r\n\r\nin  the  crucial years ahead, I must, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  point  out  that certain  features  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy as outlined require re-thinking and care in\r\n\r\ntheir  implementation. I refer to  those  features\r\n\r\npertaining  to  the introduction of  comprehensive\r\n\r\nlabour  legislation  and to  the  changes  in  the\r\n\r\neducational system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's introduction of the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill,  the fears of labour  have  been\r\n\r\nadequately expressed by my N.T.U.C, colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber. Any mention of the fears of  labour\r\n\r\non  my  part would be mere repetition. However,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to add that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  recognise that for Singapore to prosper it must\r\n\r\nencourage  and generate greater economic  activity\r\n\r\nto sustain and to improve our industrial growth. I\r\n\r\nalso  recognise  that to do this capital  must  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to remain in and flow into  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis is only possible if the investment climate in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is more favourable than that  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries. In other words, there must be political\r\n\r\nstability,  a  good communications  system,  hard-working and efficient labour, an export market for\r\n\r\ngoods  that  can compete in terms of  quality  and\r\n\r\nprice with goods of other countries, and a host of\r\n\r\nother factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers in Singapore will respond to the new\r\n\r\nchallenges   ahead  by  giving  of   their   best,\r\n\r\nespecially when they are made to feel that at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  their efforts and sacrifices, the  nation\r\n\r\nsurvives  and prospers and they will  be  given  a\r\n\r\nshare  of  the prosperity, ownership of homes  and\r\n\r\nthe  enjoyment of social facilities, such as  free\r\n\r\neducation, health and all the amenities  of  life.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is for all these that workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nare expected to co-operate with the Government  to\r\n\r\nensure our survival and prosperity, then they will\r\n\r\nnot  be  found wanting in their co-operation.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Government must always bear in mind that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have  legitimate fears that the  proposed\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill may have features that could  lead\r\n\r\nto management abusing them. Government must ensure\r\n\r\nthat  this  does not happen. It will be  good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore   if   a  situation  can   arise   where\r\n\r\nmanagement  and labour can co-operate  for  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit. Government must ensure that nothing  that\r\n\r\nit   will   do,   especially  in  new  legislation\r\n\r\naffecting labour, will harm the long-term interest\r\n\r\nof  labour. This is only possible if the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nis consulted on all matters affecting labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the changes in the education system in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I commend the Government for setting up\r\n\r\na  Cabinet Committee to supervise the planning and\r\n\r\nco-ordination of technical and vocational training\r\n\r\non a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational   basis  with  the  object  of   avoiding\r\n\r\nduplication of effort and ensuring that  technical\r\n\r\nand vocational training would be keyed to manpower\r\n\r\nneeds and employment opportunities. Not to set  up\r\n\r\nthis   committee  would  be  to  miss  the   first\r\n\r\nessential   step   in   the   massive   structural\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of the educational structure.  The\r\n\r\nEducation  Minister  in  his  speech  earlier  has\r\n\r\nmentioned that machinery has been set up to  swing\r\n\r\ninto   technical   education.  The   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Education  has  also\r\n\r\nmentioned that a crash programme will be  launched\r\n\r\nto  train craft teachers. My question is, has care\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  before all this is launched?  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat great care will be taken in the drawing up of\r\n\r\nthe   curriculum  as  well  as  the  training   of\r\n\r\nteachers. We must not produce, at the end  of  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  and vocational training,  human  robots\r\n\r\nwho  will  merely man our industries  efficiently,\r\n\r\nbut  we must also produce citizens who are capable\r\n\r\nof  feeling and understanding concepts and  values\r\n\r\nlike  democracy and loyalty to Singapore  and  who\r\n\r\nare  culturally equipped to be able to spend their\r\n\r\nleisure  hours usefully. There must not  be  over-emphasis  on  the  technical aspect  of  education\r\n\r\nwithout  also the balance of the subjects  on  the\r\n\r\nhumanities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum, under \"Ministry of Education\"\r\n\r\nsection (b) , mention is made of a concerted effort\r\n\r\nto  produce  effectively bilingual school-leavers.\r\n\r\nThis  is  laudable and goes to show that  language\r\n\r\nteaching  cannot  be isolated by itself  but  must\r\n\r\nform an integral part of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section (c) it is mentioned that there will\r\n\r\nbe  \"increasing emphasis on quality at all  levels\r\n\r\nof  education to make up shortcomings in the  past\r\n\r\nnecessitated   by   the  unprecedented   rate   of\r\n\r\nexpansion in the school system to provide a  place\r\n\r\nfor every child. Now that this quantitative target\r\n\r\nhas  been  achieved, attention will be  turned  to\r\n\r\nqualitative   improvement  in   such   fields   as\r\n\r\ncurriculum  reform, textbooks and  teaching  aids,\r\n\r\nteaching techniques,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteacher  training  and re-training,  examinations,\r\n\r\nhealth  education,  physical  education,  art  and\r\n\r\nmusic,  and  all forms of extramural  activities.\"\r\n\r\nAll these, Mr Speaker, Sir, sound pious hopes  to\r\n\r\nme. In order to have curriculum reform, changes in\r\n\r\ntextbooks, improvement in the quality of  teaching\r\n\r\nand   so  forth,  careful  research  and  adequate\r\n\r\npersonnel  are required. I hope that we will  have\r\n\r\nthe experts. We will spend enough time on research\r\n\r\nbefore  changes  are made on these very  important\r\n\r\naspects of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that teachers at\r\n\r\npresent  teaching adult education in night classes\r\n\r\nare depriving the unemployed of job opportunities.\r\n\r\nI  want  to  state here that it  is  not  easy  to\r\n\r\nreplace these teachers in night classes with those\r\n\r\nwho   are   unemployed.  The  standard  of   adult\r\n\r\neducation has got to be maintained. Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthese teachers are to be replaced, then some  care\r\n\r\nmust  be  taken  to  ensure  that  those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed will be adequately trained to take over\r\n\r\nthe night classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  first say what subjects I am not going to  talk\r\n\r\nabout?  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do  not\r\n\r\nintend  to  say  anything  at  all  about  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  because, judging by the  debates  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  practically  every Member  appears  to  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the trend of our foreign  policy.\r\n\r\nFor  those  who  are  nevertheless  interested  in\r\n\r\nknowing what our foreign policy is, I suggest that\r\n\r\nthey  read the Addendum to the President's Speech.\r\n\r\nNor  do I, as Minister for Labour, intend to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  specific points raised by certain  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in  connection with the  proposed  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation. I understand it was a bit  unfair  on\r\n\r\nthe  Members because they were discussing  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  they  had not seen. But the Bill  has  been\r\n\r\npresented today for First Reading. When  it  comes\r\n\r\nup   for  Second  Reading,  there  will  be  ample\r\n\r\nopportunities for hon. Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  discuss  it at greater length and  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail.  What  I  would like to  do  today  is  to\r\n\r\nindicate  the  wider  context  against  which  the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Bill   and  all  other   Governmental\r\n\r\nmeasures  and national policies should be studied,\r\n\r\nbecause  without these broader terms of reference,\r\n\r\nI  think  we will be in danger of looking  at  the\r\n\r\ntrees and missing the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in Singapore are fortunate in that\r\n\r\nindependence has come to us long after most of the\r\n\r\ncountries in Asia and Africa had achieved  theirs.\r\n\r\nWe achieved our independence less than three years\r\n\r\nago,  though the decolonisation process  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on  for some two decades. The advantage  we\r\n\r\nget of being latecomers to independence is that we\r\n\r\ncan  learn  from the mistakes and achievements  of\r\n\r\nour seniors - particularly their mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not decrying independence or sneering at the\r\n\r\nmisfortunes of comparatively older nations, but it\r\n\r\nis   a  fact  that  independence,  going  by   the\r\n\r\nexperience  of the last 20 years, has not  ushered\r\n\r\nin  the brave new world nationalists had hoped for\r\n\r\nand  had  promised  to  do when  they  fought  for\r\n\r\nindependence. In many newly-independent  countries\r\n\r\nwithin the region and outside, hope has given  way\r\n\r\nto  despair.  The sense of dedication and  purpose\r\n\r\nwhich  characterised nationalist leadership before\r\n\r\nindependence   has  given  way  to  venality   and\r\n\r\naimlessness. Tribal wars and racial and  religious\r\n\r\npersecutions  of  their  own  people  are   marked\r\n\r\nfeatures  in the lives of many new nations.  Riots\r\n\r\nand  violence  are endemic. And almost  everywhere\r\n\r\ntheir economics are in process of disintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the picture is not all one of\r\n\r\nunrelieved bleakness and failures. There have been\r\n\r\na  number of achievements in different fields, but\r\n\r\nthe  overall picture is one of disappointments and\r\n\r\neven  disillusionment. I do not want to infer from\r\n\r\nthis  that the struggles for independence  were  a\r\n\r\nghastly  mistake. The new nations  were  right  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  independence because no foreign  ruler\r\n\r\ncan really promote the welfare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the people. Nor do I think that the nationalist\r\n\r\nleaders  who  led  their  countries  into  freedom\r\n\r\nlacked  patriotism, courage or even  the  will  to\r\n\r\nsucceed. If they did not have these qualities they\r\n\r\ncould  not  have become successful  and  respected\r\n\r\nnationalist  leaders  or endured  the  ordeal  and\r\n\r\nrisks involved in the struggle for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If many of these countries have made a mess of\r\n\r\nindependence, it is largely because,  though  they\r\n\r\nknew  how to fight for freedom, they did not  know\r\n\r\nhow  to  consolidate it. This is one of the bitter\r\n\r\nlessons  to  be  learned from the post-independent\r\n\r\nhistory  of  new  nations. And we  are  among  the\r\n\r\nnewest of new nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it would be helpful for us in Singapore\r\n\r\nif I listed out some of the major errors which are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  dismal  state  many  newly-independent  nations find themselves in.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  very  pleasant exercise but  necessary  if\r\n\r\nSingapore is not to find itself in the blind alley\r\n\r\nsome countries have wandered into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal errors was the belief, or\r\n\r\nrather  the pathetic fallacy, that all the  evils,\r\n\r\nmiseries  and  frustrations we  experienced  under\r\n\r\ncolonialism  derived  wholly  from  the  fact   of\r\n\r\nimperial  rule. During the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nthe     propaganda    line    was    simple    and\r\n\r\nstraightforward.   Why   were   we    economically\r\n\r\nbackward?  The answer was because of  colonialism.\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause of poverty, slums, disease  and\r\n\r\nunemployment? The answer was colonialism. Why were\r\n\r\nthere  racial and religious conflicts? The  answer\r\n\r\nwas  because of colonialism. Every frustration and\r\n\r\nevery  shortcoming, we believed, was  attributable\r\n\r\nto   colonialism.  Even  today,  long  after   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists   have   faded   from   the    scene,\r\n\r\nnationalist leaders, if they cannot find the right\r\n\r\nanswer   or  dare  not  give  the  right   answer,\r\n\r\ninvariably blame it on colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is an element of truth in the answer.\r\n\r\nIn   so   far   as   a  colonial   power   assumed\r\n\r\nresponsibility or forced themselves on us for  our\r\n\r\nwelfare and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress, it had to be held accountable in so  far\r\n\r\nas it failed to promote the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect,  there is  some  truth  in  the\r\n\r\nanswer. But it is not the whole truth. Imperialism\r\n\r\nor  colonialism  was only one of the  many  causes\r\n\r\nresponsible for our backwardness. Perhaps it was a\r\n\r\ngood  and  necessary  strategy  during  the  anti-colonial  phase  of our struggle  for  nationalist\r\n\r\nleaders  to  concentrate only  on  the  evils  and\r\n\r\nshortcomings of colonialism. Because that was  the\r\n\r\nonly  way we could mobilise the people to struggle\r\n\r\nagainst colonialism. Any strategist will tell  you\r\n\r\nthat in a fight you should concentrate on only one\r\n\r\nenemy - the principal enemy. At that time, it  was\r\n\r\nthe  colonial power which was our principal  enemy\r\n\r\nbecause it was the enemy we wanted to get rid  of.\r\n\r\nThat was the strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, after independence the\r\n\r\nnationalist  leaders and many of  their  followers\r\n\r\ngot  caught  in the coils of their own propaganda.\r\n\r\nThey  believed  and  persuaded  their  people   to\r\n\r\nbelieve that now that colonialism was out  of  the\r\n\r\nway,   all   their  problems  would  automatically\r\n\r\nvanish.  Colonialism  was  responsible  for  their\r\n\r\npoverty,  misery and frustration. Colonialism  had\r\n\r\nnow  been  eliminated. The real  source  of  their\r\n\r\ntroubles  had  been  eliminated.  Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nargued,   there  should  ipso  facto   be   peace,\r\n\r\nprosperity  and brotherhood all round. The  people\r\n\r\nexpected that they could now enjoy all the  things\r\n\r\nthat  the richer colonial nations had enjoyed  but\r\n\r\nwhich they had deliberately denied to us. So  they\r\n\r\nreally  believed that colonialism was  responsible\r\n\r\nfor all our evils. And now everybody expected that\r\n\r\nit should be just the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first few years after independence - generally from my calculations it is about 10\r\n\r\nyears  after  independence - it looked  as  though\r\n\r\nthis   theory   was  right,  that   progress   and\r\n\r\nprosperity  could  come  about  automatically.  We\r\n\r\nappeared  to be having, with little or no  effort,\r\n\r\nall the things that the advanced nations have.  We\r\n\r\nmade   democratic  constitutions  equal   to   and\r\n\r\nsometimes even better than any to be found in  the\r\n\r\nadvanced countries. We erected magnificent Parliaments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  were  even  better  and   more\r\n\r\nexpensive  than  any  to be  found  in  Europe  or\r\n\r\nAmerica.  We  put  up  magnificent  administrative\r\n\r\nbuildings  and set up bureaucratic machines  which\r\n\r\nwere  equal  to any in the advanced countries,  if\r\n\r\nnot in performance, at least in numbers. We put up\r\n\r\nmagnificent  monuments  to commemorate  real,  but\r\n\r\nvery often imaginary, heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went still further and adopted the styles of\r\n\r\nliving   and  consumption  of  the  most  affluent\r\n\r\ncountries. True, this was made possible for only a\r\n\r\ntiny  minority of peoples of the new  rulers,  but\r\n\r\nthis  was very often justified on the grounds that\r\n\r\nall great advances must have small beginnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also adopted social welfare legislation, trade\r\n\r\nunion  laws  and the more pleasant  and  expensive\r\n\r\nfeatures  of well-developed countries even  though\r\n\r\nwe  lacked  the  highly  developed  economics  and\r\n\r\norganisations that made these things  possible  in\r\n\r\nadvanced countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first phase - the first few years of\r\n\r\nindependence  - when it looked as if  the  theory,\r\n\r\n\"Get  rid  of  colonialism and we move  to  peace,\r\n\r\nprosperity and happiness,\" was right. But we  know\r\n\r\nnow,  20  years after, that within  a  few  years,\r\n\r\nthings  turned  sour. The system of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  was  hastily  dismantled  in  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  newly-independent  nations  on   the\r\n\r\nground  that it did not suit the national  genius.\r\n\r\nInstead  we  had  one-man  saviours  and  military\r\n\r\ndictators.  Trade  unions  discovered  that  under\r\n\r\nconditions   of  growing  poverty   and   economic\r\n\r\ndisintegration, workers were prepared to work  for\r\n\r\na  mere pittance, whatever workers' charters might\r\n\r\nprescribe.

In many of these\r\n\r\ncountries,  even  the  few  factories  that   were\r\n\r\nerected  fell  into  disuse and  decay.  The  vast\r\n\r\nbureaucratic machines -symbols of modernisation  - hampered  rather than assisted the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  A number of them eventually  became\r\n\r\nmachines for organised graft and petty oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, many leaders in newly-independent\r\n\r\ncountries   refused  to  accept  the   fact   that\r\n\r\ncolonialism  was  not the only factor  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  their backwardness. They dared not  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople  the  unpleasant truth  that  the  road  to\r\n\r\neconomic growth and modernisation is one  of  hard\r\n\r\nwork, sacrifice and dedication, because during the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial    struggle,    they    had    said,\r\n\r\n\"Independence   means   peace,   prosperity    and\r\n\r\nprogress.\"  Therefore, they  dared  not  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople, \"Now that you have got independence,  only\r\n\r\nhard work, sacrifice and dedication can put you on\r\n\r\nthe  road  to  happiness.\" When  things  got  more\r\n\r\ndifficult and more desperate, some of the  leaders\r\n\r\ntried  to assuage the growing resentment of  their\r\n\r\npeople  by  claiming that though  colonialism  had\r\n\r\nbeen got rid of, the source of their troubles  has\r\n\r\nnow been traced to a new menace - neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\nAnd   until   very  recently,  even   though   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists had retired to temperate climates and\r\n\r\nthe  countries  concerned had been  recognised  as\r\n\r\nindependent  and free nations and given  seats  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations,  the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\nwas,  nevertheless, persisted in  for  many  years\r\n\r\nafter  that.  Or some of them tried  to  shore  up\r\n\r\ntheir crumbling economic edifice by making regular\r\n\r\npilgrimages  to European and American capitals  in\r\n\r\nsearch of loans, grants or anything that might  be\r\n\r\ngoing free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never occurred to them - though this thought\r\n\r\nis  now  fortunately dawning on the new  breed  of\r\n\r\nleaders emerging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Asia  and Africa and who I think will  be  the\r\n\r\nfuture leaders of Asia and Africa - that the cause\r\n\r\nfor  their failures and disappointments might  lie\r\n\r\nnearer  home  in the illusions and fallacies  they\r\n\r\nbred  during  the  anti-colonial  phase  of  their\r\n\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the unpleasant facts we in Singapore must\r\n\r\nface   is  that  economic  growth  and  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  cannot  be  achieved  on  the  cheap.\r\n\r\nIndustrial  development requires at  all  times  a\r\n\r\nsustained   effort,  a  willingness  to   mobilise\r\n\r\nsavings,  a  readiness to take risks, a propensity\r\n\r\nfor innovation, a passionate vision of the future,\r\n\r\na  willingness  to  make the  painful  adjustments\r\n\r\nrequired  by modernisation and, most important  of\r\n\r\nall,  a readiness on the part of the people  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  to  postpone immediate rewards for  greater\r\n\r\ngains  in the future. This is the premise on which\r\n\r\nwe  can  build  genuine  economic  and  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment. If we do not accept this  proposition\r\n\r\nas  true, then I think we are wasting time; we are\r\n\r\nfooling the people when we talk of economic growth\r\n\r\nand  industrial  development. We must  accept  the\r\n\r\nfundamental belief that if we want economic growth\r\n\r\nand industrial development, we must be prepared to\r\n\r\npay the difficult and heavy price that it demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not prepared to pay this price, if we\r\n\r\nare  not prepared to accept this as a basis of our\r\n\r\nfuture  policy, then there will be  little  or  no\r\n\r\neconomic   development.   The   present   leaders,\r\n\r\nespecially we in Parliament, can, if we like, fool\r\n\r\nthe  people,  as some leaders in newly-independent\r\n\r\ncountries  have done, into believing that  we  can\r\n\r\nbring  them  prosperity without tears and  effort.\r\n\r\nAnd if we did, then in five or ten years, we would\r\n\r\ngo  the  way of many independent countries -  into\r\n\r\nbankruptcy and despair. Only in Singapore, we have\r\n\r\nnot  got  the escape hatch that many countries  in\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia have. We have not got vast  scrub-lands  and  lush jungles to which the dispossessed\r\n\r\nand impoverished can flee to scratch some sort  of\r\n\r\nliving, either by hunting or growing bananas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand tapioca. Economic collapse or stagnation for a\r\n\r\ndensely  populated,  nonagricultural  and   highly\r\n\r\ncommercialised  island like Singapore  means  mass\r\n\r\nstarvation. The Prime Minister has said repeatedly\r\n\r\nthat  in one square mile we sustain something like\r\n\r\n7,000 people. If our commerce and industry come to\r\n\r\na  halt, the only way 7,000 people can survive  is\r\n\r\nby eating one another! We cannot grow anything, we\r\n\r\ncannot   plant   vegetables,   we   cannot   start\r\n\r\nagriculture. There are about 7,000 people  in  one\r\n\r\nsquare  mile. So for us the price of  collapse  is\r\n\r\ntotal  disaster.  Our  commercial  and  industrial\r\n\r\neconomy  is such that, like a cyclist, we have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  moving  in order not to fall  off.  We  must\r\n\r\nalways be on the move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the time has now come for us - employers,\r\n\r\nworkers  and the people in general - to develop  a\r\n\r\nnew  outlook. The old slogans, the old  cries  and\r\n\r\nthe  old  attitudes of 20 years  ago  have  become\r\n\r\nirrelevant to the times as they are today  and  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to face totally different problems  in\r\n\r\nthe  future. Therefore, we have to develop  a  new\r\n\r\noutlook, a new philosophy to meet the challenge of\r\n\r\nthe  new times. For want of a better name, I  will\r\n\r\ncall   it   the   philosophy  of  development   as\r\n\r\ncontrasted with the current outlook which  can  be\r\n\r\ndescribed as the philosophy of consumption  -  the\r\n\r\noutlook  of  the ant which builds  or  the  locust\r\n\r\nwhich  consumes.  It was perhaps  inevitable  that\r\n\r\nunder  colonialism we should have developed  to  a\r\n\r\nhigh   degree  a  consumption  mentality   without\r\n\r\nrealising  that in a healthy economy the  capacity\r\n\r\nto  consume  should be related to the capacity  to\r\n\r\nproduce, because when the colonials were in charge\r\n\r\nof  Singapore they never talked about development,\r\n\r\nfor   their   own   interest   and   exploitation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  for us the concept of development  has\r\n\r\nnever  occurred. The only thing we could think  of\r\n\r\nto  make life worth while was to ask -\"What can we\r\n\r\nconsume? How much can we consume?\" And that became\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of life. So under colonial  rule  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  workers  and  trade  unionists   were\r\n\r\ndirected  towards one objective - to  redistribute\r\n\r\nwealth (for that is a way of consuming) by way of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher wages and better conditions of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of employers was to extract the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of profits in the shortest possible  time\r\n\r\nand  use  these profits to consume more  and  make\r\n\r\nmore  profits. This was the basis of our  economic\r\n\r\nactivity. Consume - whether as workers, whether as\r\n\r\nemployers, whether as professional men, whether as\r\n\r\ncivil  servants. We earned more to buy more, built\r\n\r\nbigger  houses,  bought bigger cars.  We  observed\r\n\r\nstandards   of  life  which  were   set   by   the\r\n\r\nexpatriates who came here on the basis  that  they\r\n\r\nwere in exile, that they should make as much money\r\n\r\nas  they  normally would in half the time if  they\r\n\r\nwere   in  Europe,  and  go  back.  So  once   the\r\n\r\nexpatriates retired or were Malayanised,  the  new\r\n\r\nelite  stepped  in, not only into the  office  but\r\n\r\nalso  into the standard of life and style of  life\r\n\r\nthat the departing expatriates had set for them  - the  same  pay, the same size of house,  the  same\r\n\r\nsize of limousine - not knowing that that kind  of\r\n\r\nlife  was not related to our own economy.  It  was\r\n\r\nnot related to what we could produce what we could\r\n\r\nmaintain. It was set by expatriates who felt  that\r\n\r\nthey had come to this country as a punishment and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they needed extra for their effort. But\r\n\r\nwe  nevertheless continue to get this compensatory\r\n\r\npay that was reserved for exiled expatriates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that we are independent and are on our\r\n\r\nown,   this  kind  of  approach,  the  consumption\r\n\r\npsychology,  is  a  sure  and  certain   road   to\r\n\r\ndisaster. At least in the crucial years ahead  the\r\n\r\nmajor  objective to which all other issues  should\r\n\r\nbe  subordinated is this: it is not redistribution\r\n\r\nof  wealth but the creation of wealth that  should\r\n\r\nbe  our  major and relentless concern. This  is  a\r\n\r\nconcept  which has never occurred to us and  which\r\n\r\nhas never entered either into the minds of workers\r\n\r\nor  employers. Anything that hampers  and  retards\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of wealth must be checked,  however\r\n\r\nunpopular and however painful this may be. But the\r\n\r\nhard facts of economic life leave us with no other\r\n\r\nchoice. You cannot evade these hard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacts. The cost of evading them, as many countries\r\n\r\nhave  discovered,  is certain  disaster.  This  is\r\n\r\nobvious,   if   you   keep  on  distributing   and\r\n\r\nredistributing  the same amount  of  wealth  among\r\n\r\nmore  and  more people - because in Singapore  the\r\n\r\npopulation  is increasing at a rapid rate  -  what\r\n\r\nyou  get is not a more prosperous people but  more\r\n\r\nand more poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of redistribution becomes real and\r\n\r\nmeaningful  only after you have created sufficient\r\n\r\nwealth,  additional  wealth.  Then  redistribution\r\n\r\nmakes  for a genuine increase in living standards.\r\n\r\nRaising  wages  and maintaining welfare  standards\r\n\r\nunrelated  to  the  level of economic  development\r\n\r\nresults in spurious prosperity. When wages  go  up\r\n\r\nin  a  poor  country, as it has often  been  done,\r\n\r\nprices go up and the worker is precisely where  he\r\n\r\nwas  before. It is no use trying to ward this  off\r\n\r\nby  price  controls.  Experience  has  shown  that\r\n\r\nattempts    at   price   controls   under    these\r\n\r\ncircumstances in developing countries have  merely\r\n\r\npaved  the  way  for more corruption  and  rampant\r\n\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only practical way of raising living\r\n\r\nstandards and bringing about genuine prosperity is\r\n\r\nby  creating  more  and more  wealth.  This  means\r\n\r\nproducing more and consuming less than we produce.\r\n\r\nWe  must  save enough to invest in more factories,\r\n\r\nmore enterprises to produce more wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the affluent and advanced countries of today,\r\n\r\nwhether  Communist  or non-Communist,  had  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  a  long  period of  heart-breaking  toil,\r\n\r\ndiscipline   and  sacrifice  -  and   very   often\r\n\r\nunimaginable   horrors   associated    with    the\r\n\r\nindustrial revolution in Europe - before they made\r\n\r\nthe  grade. Sometimes we forget that every country\r\n\r\nwhich   is   advanced,  every  country  which   is\r\n\r\nprosperous  today,  paid a  heavy  price.  It  was\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  exploitation,  injustice,   child\r\n\r\nlabour,  long hours of work. I would  advise  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to read the history of modernisation  and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Europe, in the Soviet  Union,\r\n\r\nin America and in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  would  then begin to realise  what  a  heavy\r\n\r\nprice,  an  almost intolerable price, people  have\r\n\r\nhad to pay for modernisation and advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These countries which are now judged as affluent,\r\n\r\nas  advanced, were lucky in that they embarked  on\r\n\r\nmodernisation  and  industrialisation  when  there\r\n\r\nwere   no   trade   unions  and   no   Parliament.\r\n\r\nModernisation  in  most  of  these  countries  was\r\n\r\npushed  through by dictators, autocratic  monarchs\r\n\r\nor  elites who were not dependent on popular vote.\r\n\r\nSo they could extract the price for modernisation,\r\n\r\nsometimes  an  inhuman  price  for  modernisation,\r\n\r\nknowing full well that there were no trade  unions\r\n\r\nor  Parliament  to call them to  account.  In  the\r\n\r\nSoviet  Union, if you were to read its history  in\r\n\r\nthe  early days of industrialisation, two  million\r\n\r\nwere  deliberately left to starve to  death.  That\r\n\r\nwas   the  price  that  even  a  workers'  country\r\n\r\ndemanded, that workers must pay for modernisation.\r\n\r\nIn  China  more recently, there was a  case  where\r\n\r\nthree  and a half million people were deliberately\r\n\r\nallowed  to starve to death because there  was  no\r\n\r\nchoice.  That  was the only way that  China  could\r\n\r\nmake  the  advance that she had made  so  quickly,\r\n\r\nespecially in the fields of industrialisation  and\r\n\r\nmodernisation of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in Singapore have to proceed with our\r\n\r\nmodernisation and industrialisation at a time when\r\n\r\nwe   have  well-developed  trade  unions   and   a\r\n\r\ndemocratically   elected  Parliament.   We   must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   undertake  the  difficult   task   of\r\n\r\nbringing about industrialisation and modernisation\r\n\r\nwith  popular support. This is our problem. For  a\r\n\r\nsmall  island we have to force the pace not  under\r\n\r\nconditions  where we have not got to bother  about\r\n\r\ntrade  unions or Parliament, but where we have  to\r\n\r\nbother about both. And maybe this is a good  thing\r\n\r\nbecause then we may be able to avoid some  of  the\r\n\r\nunnecessary  injustices, hardships and brutalities\r\n\r\nthat     accompanied     industrialisation     and\r\n\r\nmodernisation in some of the now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries.  But we  cannot  do  this  if\r\n\r\npolitical   leaders,  trade  union   leaders   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs are not themselves inspired  by  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  of development. They must  be  passion\r\n\r\nately  convinced  of  the  need  for  development.\r\n\r\nBelief in this must permeate their being and their\r\n\r\nthinking.  It  must become a part of their  being,\r\n\r\npart  of  their way of life. The need for economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  or  development must become an  insatiable\r\n\r\nhunger  -if you like, a religion. If you read  the\r\n\r\nhistory   of  industrialisation  in  Europe,   for\r\n\r\nexample, in Britain, especially during the Puritan\r\n\r\nand Victorian era, work became a religion. To save\r\n\r\nwas to glorify God. That was the Protestant ethic.\r\n\r\nTo live frugally, to practise thrift, to work hard\r\n\r\n-   that   was   the  belief  that  inspired   the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,    the    entrepreneurs,    the\r\n\r\ncapitalists in Europe and most of Western  Europe.\r\n\r\nIf  we want to develop a meaningful philosophy  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment, then we must bring to this  task  the\r\n\r\nsame measure of courage, dedication and discipline\r\n\r\nthat we brought to the anti-colonial struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the other fears and doubts that the\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders might have in regard  to  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Employment Bill, I would  urge  them  to\r\n\r\nconsider  seriously what it is that they  want  in\r\n\r\nterms   of   priority.  Do  they   want   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  economic  growth,  whatever  the\r\n\r\ncost?  If you read the Bill, however, it does  not\r\n\r\nput up the cost so high as to make it intolerable.\r\n\r\nBut  do  you  say,  \"Whatever the  cost,  we  want\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.\"? In a way, Sir, trade  unionism\r\n\r\nand  parliamentary democracy for us  have  been  a\r\n\r\ndistortion of history. As I have said earlier,  in\r\n\r\nEurope industrialisation came first and out of the\r\n\r\nstruggle   parliamentary   democracy   and   trade\r\n\r\nunionism  grew  naturally.  So,  as  the   economy\r\n\r\ndeveloped, trade unions also developed and  became\r\n\r\nmore  mature  and  more  powerful.  But  here  the\r\n\r\nhistory is just the reverse. We get Parliament and\r\n\r\ntrade  unions first. And then we start on economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and industrialisation. There has  been\r\n\r\na reversal, a distortion of history, not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessarily a bad thing provided trade  unionists,\r\n\r\nemployers  and  political leaders understand  that\r\n\r\nthere has been a distortion which we must correct.\r\n\r\nAnd  therefore  they must come to the  problem  of\r\n\r\nindustrial and economic development with  a  sense\r\n\r\nof  understanding and responsibility of what it is\r\n\r\nthat is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, since we have to do this in a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  way  with the consent and  support  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and employers, we must develop  this\r\n\r\nalmost religious fervour for development. They  do\r\n\r\nit  in  the Communist countries. They make work  a\r\n\r\nreligion.  Stakonovite - a people's  worker.  They\r\n\r\nglorify work. If you are in China, or in Russia in\r\n\r\nthe early days, any worker who said, \"Why should I\r\n\r\nwork  52  hours?  Why  not 50  hours?\",  would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  a  heretic. If you want  to  make  the\r\n\r\ngrade,  if you show that only by working 52  hours\r\n\r\nyou  can catch up with the West, the Germans,  the\r\n\r\nimperialists, then you work 52 hours. So you get a\r\n\r\nStakonovite coming and proving that a man can work\r\n\r\n55 hours, and he becomes a hero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only when leaders develop this philosophy\r\n\r\nand  fervour that they can transmit some of  their\r\n\r\nfervour  to  the people and make them  work-minded\r\n\r\nand   development-minded.  Only  then,  when   the\r\n\r\nleaders  show this, will the people willingly  put\r\n\r\nup  with  the difficulties and hardships necessary\r\n\r\nto complete the task of modernisation and economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. But if the leaders are weak, if  they\r\n\r\nhave   no  faith  in  the  necessity  of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the imperative need  for  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, if they are cowardly, if they  choose\r\n\r\nthe  easy way out, then Singapore goes the way  of\r\n\r\nmany other new nations. But if they are courageous\r\n\r\nand  determined, then I think that ten  to  twenty\r\n\r\nyears from now, those who come after us will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, in the hour of need Singapore did  not\r\n\r\nlack  real leaders.
