This  estimate  includes  both  capital  and\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure. However, as the  plans  for\r\n\r\nthe  defence  services of Singapore are  now  under\r\n\r\nrevision,  this estimate must also be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nsubject  to  revision. It will not be  possible  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  new estimate until the revised plans  have\r\n\r\nbeen finalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to contributions to Commonwealth\r\n\r\ndefence, the Contribution to Imperial\r\n\r\nDefence   Ordinance  (Chapter  64  of  the  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition) prescribes that an annual contribution  of\r\n\r\n$4  million  will be made to imperial defence  from\r\n\r\nthe funds of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.\r\n\r\nAfter  the war, when the Settlements of Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca  became part of the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nliability for this contribution was apportioned and\r\n\r\nSingapore's  share became $2,628,000. It  was  then\r\n\r\nagreed  with  Her  Majesty's Government  that  this\r\n\r\ncontribution   might   be   devoted   to    meeting\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the Royal Malayan Navy and  special\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  the Malayan Royal Naval  Volunteer\r\n\r\nReserve.   In  the  early  years  after  the   war,\r\n\r\nexpenditure on these forces did not come up to  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of the defence contribution and the balances\r\n\r\nwere held in the Royal Malayan Navy Fund for use in\r\n\r\nfuture  when expenditure on the Royal Malayan  Navy\r\n\r\nand  the  Malayan  Royal  Naval  Volunteer  Reserve\r\n\r\nincreased. This expenditure has increased  and  the\r\n\r\nFund has slowly been run down until now in 1956  it\r\n\r\nis exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I had hoped\r\n\r\nby   the  question  to  elicit  an  indication   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy towards defence forces for  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years, but we have been given  what,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  is available now on the papers before us.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  such  a  warning was given by the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary in the Official Report, Vol. 1,  No.  19,\r\n\r\ndated  21st November, 1955, at col. 1063  where  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that he was not going to be accused of crying\r\n\r\nwolf  once more and that we were going to be  faced\r\n\r\n\"with the hard reality of actual deficits\". Now  we\r\n\r\nare coming to the end of 1956 and we know the exact\r\n\r\nposition, and the position is that we still have  a\r\n\r\nsurplus.  Invariably there is always a  surplus  in\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of collection of taxes. This  fact  is\r\n\r\nknown  by everybody almost every year and in effect\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary admits it. On page 1 of his\r\n\r\nBudget speech he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In all, it seems likely that revenue collections\r\n\r\nwill amount to about $217 million compared with the\r\n\r\nestimate of $215 million.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, the Financial Secretary admits\r\n\r\nthat the estimate for tax collection is always low,\r\n\r\nwhereas the estimate for expenditure will always be\r\n\r\nhigher than it should be. Why is it so? I think  it\r\n\r\nis  just  to  create the impression that additional\r\n\r\ntaxation is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 2 of his Budget speech in the second paragraph, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...that the working for 1956 will show a small surplus, possibly of the order of $2 or $3 million.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an admission by the Financial Secretary himself, Sir, and it is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on page 5, in the fourth paragraph, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...actual expenditure has in the past in variably\r\n\r\nfallen  short of the estimate. It is  likely  that\r\n\r\nthis will occur again in 1957.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again on page 6 the same tune is played, and\r\n\r\nhere he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...it is possible that actual expenditure will\r\n\r\nfall considerably short of the estimate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Budget speech the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nhas   drawn   our  attention  to  the   fact   that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will not be as high as  has  been  put\r\n\r\nforward in the Estimates. It is significant that he\r\n\r\nhas  drawn our attention to it more than once and,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  supposed to be an  expert  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject,  we  must  believe that  expenditure  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely fall short of the estimate as  presented\r\n\r\nby  the  Government. Now here we have a case  where\r\n\r\nevery year you are going to have the collection  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  more  than  the actual expenditure  which,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the estimate put out, will  be  less\r\n\r\nthan  what is presented to us, and in the end there\r\n\r\nwill  always be a surplus. This has been  going  on\r\n\r\nthrough  the  years. Every year we  have  had  this\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs, and this leads us  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nquestion whether there is any necessity at all  for\r\n\r\nfurther taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, with all the warnings by the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary that the future is  bleak,  we\r\n\r\nmust   tighten  our  belts,  we  must   pay   more,\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  mounting and all  that,  all  this\r\n\r\ntends  to  give the impression to hon.  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House as well as to the public at large  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  in real need of further taxation when,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  from  all that has been said,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity at all. Perhaps it is just the  way  with\r\n\r\neverybody, just like boys between the ages of 8 and\r\n\r\n10,  that it is a habit to hoard some money. It  is\r\n\r\njust  an instinct with Government, I think, to want\r\n\r\nto  feel the money in its pocket and jingle it  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Now, I have the money and if I want to spend\r\n\r\nit  on anything extravagant, I can do it. There  is\r\n\r\nno  need  to  cut my coat according to  the  cloth.\r\n\r\nThere  is no need to think of saving on this little\r\n\r\nitem  or that. The public will pay whenever we  tax\r\n\r\nthem, because the power is in our hands. So long as\r\n\r\nwe  have  money, well, it is public money, although\r\n\r\nwe  may have contributed a little to it in the  way\r\n\r\nof  income  tax.  So let us spend  it,  let  us  be\r\n\r\ngenerous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  it.\" If that is the case, Sir, I think it  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely wrong. We are here as guardians  of  the\r\n\r\npeople's money. We have to spend it wisely. We must\r\n\r\nthink  of  every cent that has to be spent.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  it is other people's money, the public's\r\n\r\nmoney,  that we should exercise even more  care  in\r\n\r\nspending it or even in wanting it. I cite  you  one\r\n\r\ncase,  Sir.  The Government promised  us  something\r\n\r\nlast  year during the debate on the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Appropriation Bill, but I am still looking\r\n\r\nforward  to  that promise being kept. I refer  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  to  the same Official Report that  I  have\r\n\r\njust quoted from, this time at col. 1010, where the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister   (he  is  now  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill),  in  reply to a  question  by  my  hon.\r\n\r\nFriend  the Member for Tiong Bahru on the  question\r\n\r\nof  the  personal emoluments of the civil  service,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am far from complacent about the expenditures\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. We have been seven  months  in\r\n\r\noffice, Sir, and this sort of axing is not done  in\r\n\r\na day. I certainly intend to pursue methods which I\r\n\r\nhave  in  mind for greater reduction in expenditure\r\n\r\nin the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, was a promise by the then Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   to   look  into  the   matter   of   the\r\n\r\nexpenditures  of  the Government.  Today,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nstill  have, with the exception of one Member,  the\r\n\r\nsame   people  sitting  on  the  Government   Front\r\n\r\nBenches, and I expect that, because it is a  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Coalition Government, it will carry out  the\r\n\r\nsame promises that it has made to the people, and I\r\n\r\nhope  that regarding this matter it will carry  out\r\n\r\nits  promise. According to the Budget,  however,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the increase is in the region of $98 million\r\n\r\nto  $113  million. That is a big jump for  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments.  I think the Government in this  matter\r\n\r\ndid  try and tell the public, \"We will try our best\r\n\r\nand streamline the Government. We have, in fact, an\r\n\r\nOrganisation Committee to streamline everything, to\r\n\r\nadvise  us  on methods, to advise us  on  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  of  giving a more efficient service  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  and at a lesser cost.\" Yet, with all  these\r\n\r\nmethods    and   streamlining   experts,    nothing\r\n\r\nsubstantial has been produced. In fact, if we  draw\r\n\r\na  graph on a matter of expenditure of this nature,\r\n\r\nwe will find that it goes on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-I  will  say Y is equal to MX plus C, which  is  a\r\n\r\nstraight  line graph, showing that it is  going  up\r\n\r\nall the time. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us consider again whether Government\r\n\r\nactually needs all this extra money by taxation for\r\n\r\nnext  year's Budget. During the Second  Reading  we\r\n\r\nheard  from the Financial Secretary that the relief\r\n\r\nfor  income  tax  will be lowered  from  $3,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,500 for a single individual, and that this is  a\r\n\r\n\"must\". Sir, I have received news again through the\r\n\r\nPress that the Government has waived that reduction\r\n\r\nand  has  restored  the floor  for  income  tax  to\r\n\r\n$3,000.  This  is  really  commendable - that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can still take heed of public opinion. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  quarrel  with granting  relief  to  people\r\n\r\npaying  income tax, but one thing which strikes  me\r\n\r\nis  this.  Here you have a government  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  that we need more money. We must raise  our\r\n\r\nmoney  by income tax and by more tax. We must raise\r\n\r\nmoney  by  taxing  cigarettes, by taxing  on  other\r\n\r\nvices  like  sweepstakes and so on.  We  must  have\r\n\r\ndirect  taxation.  We must have indirect  taxation.\r\n\r\nAll these are \"musts\". And after the Government has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  all  these are \"musts\",  we  find  that\r\n\r\nsuddenly,  because there is pressure from  outside,\r\n\r\nit  is  going to be unpopular, people are going  to\r\n\r\nthrow mud at the Government more than is necessary,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  says, \"Oh  no,  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nreplace  that $500 tax relief. No, we do  not  need\r\n\r\nthat much money from taxation of that kind. We  can\r\n\r\nmake up for that. We can still spend our money  and\r\n\r\nnot  feel  the shortage.\" Let me put the case  this\r\n\r\nway. If the Government needs money and collects  it\r\n\r\nby that sort of taxation, and then it withdraws the\r\n\r\nproposal  to impose that kind of taxation,  then  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that every time it wants to impose a tax on\r\n\r\nsomething  and  enough  opposition  is  whipped  up\r\n\r\nagainst  it,  I am sure the Government  will  in  a\r\n\r\nsimilar way withdraw and say, \"We will withdraw the\r\n\r\ntaxation - \".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

So we have\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of  affair going on  every  time.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  says it is going to tax something  and\r\n\r\nthat  it is a \"must\", but when it comes up against\r\n\r\nopposition,  it  withdraws.  So  its  \"musts\"  are\r\n\r\nactually  elastic ones and not like  an  unbending\r\n\r\nmetal  rod. You cannot twist it, nor can you  bend\r\n\r\nit.  In  fact,  I  think  there  is  no  necessity\r\n\r\nwhatsoever for any taxation. There is no need  for\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation. You can spend the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  derived from the old tax and that  will  be\r\n\r\nmore than sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at the proposed taxation\r\n\r\nprogramme of the Government. The first item on the\r\n\r\nlist  is  income  tax. I would like  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the Government to its old  election\r\n\r\npledge -  that it will only tax those who are  most\r\n\r\nable  to  bear the burden. It is a very good  idea\r\n\r\nbut  the point is how to carry it out in practice.\r\n\r\nTheory  is one thing, practice is another. If  you\r\n\r\nsay one thing is good and then you do not practise\r\n\r\nit,  then  what will people think about  you?  Not\r\n\r\nmuch, I am afraid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He is talking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am talking! In the matter\r\n\r\nof  taxation  there are two ways.  One  is  direct\r\n\r\ntaxation,  by  way  of income tax.  The  other  is\r\n\r\nindirect taxation. If we have direct taxation, and\r\n\r\nincome tax, then we really put the burden on those\r\n\r\nwho  can best bear it, because in income tax those\r\n\r\nwho  earn  more will pay more and those  who  earn\r\n\r\nless  will  pay less. I think that is the  fairest\r\n\r\nway   of  taxation.  In  the  matter  of  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxation,   you  find  so  many  people   in   the\r\n\r\nstreets - whether  they are rich or poor - indulge  in\r\n\r\ntheir  little vices and their bad habits  with  no\r\n\r\ndistinction,  and, in fact, many of  the  rich  do\r\n\r\nnot.  So,  if  any money is to be drawn  from  the\r\n\r\npublic,  the  rich man will pay his little  share,\r\n\r\nprobably in the ratio of one in half a million.  I\r\n\r\nam  talking of adults. I do not know, but  it  may\r\n\r\nextend  to  young people, and that will even  make\r\n\r\nthe  share  of  a rich man less. On this  type  of\r\n\r\ntaxation you tax not only on the bad habits of the\r\n\r\npeople,  such  as smoking, gambling and  drinking,\r\n\r\nbut I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  afraid  that it will also touch on  the  daily\r\n\r\nnecessities of everybody. I will come to that soon\r\n\r\nenough. So if the Government is going to carry out\r\n\r\nits policy and say that tax is going to be imposed\r\n\r\non  those who can best afford it, it must not have\r\n\r\ndirect   taxation  and  then  indirect   taxation.\r\n\r\nIndirect  taxation must be reduced to the absolute\r\n\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> No schools, no teachers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Do not worry about that.

On  a  matter\r\n\r\nlike  this,  it  is just like a  firm  engaging  a\r\n\r\nmanager. The manager will say, \"We will spend this\r\n\r\nand  we  will  spend that and we will  gather  our\r\n\r\nincome  this way and that way.\" But if at the  end\r\n\r\nof the financial year it is found that the manager\r\n\r\nis  not going to make his ends meet, not only will\r\n\r\nthe  shop  have  to  close down  but  the  manager\r\n\r\nhimself will get the sack. He will be very glad to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the tax programme of the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Government if he gets unemployed! Let us\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  the first item of  taxation - income\r\n\r\ntax.  The Government is now proposing to  do  away\r\n\r\nwith  the  lowering of that $500  relief,  but  it\r\n\r\nstill  intends to do away with the three per  cent\r\n\r\nand  the  four per cent and change these rates  to\r\n\r\nfive  per  cent.  Sir,  in  this  connection   the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary stated that a programme  like\r\n\r\nthis  would  bring in an income  of  roughly  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  is  a  small  sum,  but   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes away that $500, as it intends  to\r\n\r\ndo,  and only changes the rates of three per  cent\r\n\r\nand  four per cent to five per cent, then the only\r\n\r\npeople  who  will be affected will be the  present\r\n\r\nincome  taxpayers - only  19,000  persons.  It   can\r\n\r\neasily be calculated that each person is going  to\r\n\r\npay the Government roughly -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.

In fact, the people  who  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taxed now - the 19,000 people - are paying quite\r\n\r\na large percentage of the revenue of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What we need is a more\r\n\r\nefficient Income Tax Department to bring  in  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  not yet been taxed but are  within  that\r\n\r\ntaxable  range. As far as income tax is  concerned,\r\n\r\nSir, I know that we only grant relief to the income\r\n\r\ntaxpayer,  his  wife  and  his  children.  Let   us\r\n\r\nremember that we are living in the East and in  the\r\n\r\nEast the set-up of the family is entirely different\r\n\r\nfrom that in the West. In the East the parents  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  as an integral part of the  family,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the most important part of the family.  When\r\n\r\nthe  children grow up and after they have  obtained\r\n\r\ntheir  education and are able to earn their living,\r\n\r\nthey  will, by custom and tradition, support  their\r\n\r\nparents. In fact, it is their duty to do so.  This,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  one of the best attributes of  those  who\r\n\r\nlive in the East. The family ties are strong. So we\r\n\r\nhave  here the case of the taxpayer supporting  his\r\n\r\nparents, instead of the father running along to the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department and saying, \"Sir, I  have\r\n\r\nno job and my son is not supporting me. I must live\r\n\r\non  the  public dole.\" The public dole is  $15  per\r\n\r\nperson.  If you calculate the number of old parents\r\n\r\nwho  depend  on  the dole, you will find  that  the\r\n\r\nmoney  given  out comes up to a very sizeable  sum.\r\n\r\nThat sum of money should have come from Government,\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  saved  for  the  Government.  Why  is  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure   saved?  Because   of   this   Chinese\r\n\r\ntradition,  that  the son who is  able  to  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving  should  support his  parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this House, Sir, have declared ourselves to be staunch\r\n\r\nsupporters  of  the cultures of the East.  We  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  support  Chinese  culture,  Indian\r\n\r\nculture  and so on, but we must prove that  we  are\r\n\r\nreally supporting it by implementing measures which\r\n\r\nwill convince the public at large that we recognise\r\n\r\nthat  fact  and that we will do it. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  had  troubles with the Chinese school students\r\n\r\nwho said, \"You are destroying Chinese culture\", and\r\n\r\nthey told the Chief Minister, \"Chinese culture says\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  hsueh  hsi\" and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation said, \"You must respect the teachers  and\r\n\r\nhonour   your   parents.\"  Here,   then,   is   the\r\n\r\nopportunity for the Government to ram home the fact\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore that it  is  going  to\r\n\r\nuphold Chinese culture and it is going to amend its\r\n\r\nlaws  in  accordance with the way of  life  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the East. If you are talking about  the\r\n\r\nWest,  then  you  may object to  my  talking  about\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  East. But let us also  talk  about\r\n\r\nEngland.  Let  us  talk about  America.  These  are\r\n\r\ncountries that the Government likes. In America and\r\n\r\nin  England you still have relief for parents,  and\r\n\r\nif  you  look it up, you will find that in  special\r\n\r\ncases  they give allowances to such people. So  why\r\n\r\ncannot  we  in  Singapore do that? If  we  do  that\r\n\r\nfaster  and  quicker, it will  be  better  for  us. [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the 3 per cent and 4 per cent rates of\r\n\r\ntaxation  again,  Sir,  it  is  contrary   to   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  the  Labour Front.  The  burden  of\r\n\r\ntaxation will not be on those who are more able  to\r\n\r\nbear  it,  but  it  will be on everybody  who  pays\r\n\r\nincome  tax;  in  other words, everybody  must  pay\r\n\r\nadditional tax. Whether it is $15, or $10,  or  $2,\r\n\r\nor  $1,  it  is  still taxation. If the  Government\r\n\r\nobtains  $1 by income tax, $5 by taxing cigarettes,\r\n\r\n$10  by taxing petrol, and so much by another  kind\r\n\r\nof  taxation,  you will find that the  poor  worker\r\n\r\nwill have to pay, not just $5 or $10, but much more\r\n\r\nthan you think they do.

If you compare  the  value  of\r\n\r\nmoney  in 1940 with what it is now, you will  find,\r\n\r\nin  all probability, that the value of money now is\r\n\r\nonly one-fifth of what it was in 1940.

The barrage has\r\n\r\nstarted from the opposite Benches, Sir, and  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  right  that they should receive  a  salvo  in\r\n\r\nreply!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking about the poor income-tax\r\n\r\npayer. We tax on $3,000, but if you think about its\r\n\r\nvalue as compared to 1940 or so, it will roughly be\r\n\r\n$600 and that will work out to $50 a month, and $50\r\n\r\na  month  even  in 1940, Sir, would  not  ensure  a\r\n\r\nperson a good standard of living. This person  will\r\n\r\nnot  have sufficient for his needs and, because  of\r\n\r\nthe  set-up in the East, it is not only his parents\r\n\r\nthat  he  must feed and look after, but once  in  a\r\n\r\nwhile  one  or two unemployed relatives  will  come\r\n\r\nrunning  to him for a little financial help - it  may\r\n\r\nbe $5 or $10 - and sometimes these unfortunate people\r\n\r\nmay  have  to  be  given shelter and  lodging,  and\r\n\r\nfurther  he  may  unwillingly have  to  take  in  a\r\n\r\nhelping  hand. My contention, then, is that  income\r\n\r\ntax relief should not only be restored as it is now\r\n\r\nto  $3,000,  but  also include further  relief  for\r\n\r\nparents.  Everybody recognises that it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  children to honour their parents. It is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Commandments in the Bible. So it is  with  the\r\n\r\nMuslims   and  the  Indians,  too.   It   is   with\r\n\r\neverybody's  belief. Let us show them that  we  are\r\n\r\ndifferent from the West where parents can  be  left\r\n\r\nout after they have brought us up. The old folks go\r\n\r\nto  old-age  homes. They get government dole.  They\r\n\r\nget  old-age pensions. As an illustration,  I  know\r\n\r\nthat the following case can happen in England. If I\r\n\r\nam  a friend of the son and I want to go to another\r\n\r\nplace  where the son's father is staying,  the  son\r\n\r\nwill send his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfather  a  cheque, say, of \u00a35 and he will  ask  his\r\n\r\nfather to entertain me on his account. The son will\r\n\r\nthen tell the father to send him back the bill  for\r\n\r\nentertainment  expenses and also to send  back  the\r\n\r\nbalance  if  there is any remaining. I  have  known\r\n\r\ncases like this personally, but in our Chinese set-up,  it is not like this. My father's friend is  my\r\n\r\nfriend  and  my friend is also my father's  friend,\r\n\r\nand  if my father has not enough money to entertain\r\n\r\nhis friend, it is my duty to give it to him. And if\r\n\r\nI cannot afford it but my father can, he will do it\r\n\r\nfor  me.  When my father brought me up, he gave  me\r\n\r\neverything that I had and now it is only  a  return\r\n\r\nof his generosity. Nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, the Financial Secretary telling us\r\n\r\nthat  in the United Kingdom people are being  taxed\r\n\r\nmuch  more - 7\u00bd per cent at the minimum. He  says  we\r\n\r\nhave  lower  taxation here and we still grumble.  I\r\n\r\nwill not grumble, Sir, if we follow it even in  the\r\n\r\nhigher  ranges  of income. But I am  not  going  to\r\n\r\nfollow little bits here and little bits there  just\r\n\r\nto  suit the purpose of the Government. No, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the tax on tobacco. Oh, tobacco is\r\n\r\nnot  essential! If you do not smoke cigarettes, you\r\n\r\nwill  not starve and you will not die! Yes, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  his views. So we increase the  tax  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  So the poor man in the  street,  after\r\n\r\nhearing of the increased tax on cigarettes  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  will  make a resolution  and  say,  \"I\r\n\r\nshall  not smoke from today on.\" Other people  will\r\n\r\nmake  the resolution, \"Whereas in the past  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  smoking ten cigarettes a day.

I am not prepared to quarrel  with\r\n\r\nhigher  taxation on cigarettes, not like the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  Government can carry on taxing  cigarettes.  I\r\n\r\nwill  not also say that I am going to criticise  it\r\n\r\nseverely,  but  there is one aspect of  the  matter\r\n\r\nwhich I think the Government should know and should\r\n\r\nstudy very carefully, and it is this. The poor  man\r\n\r\nwill  now  have  to pay more for his  tobacco.  His\r\n\r\nsource of income is only from his employer; and  if\r\n\r\nhe  has to pay more, it means he will have less for\r\n\r\nhis family; and if he is going to have less for the\r\n\r\nfamily, he is not going to be contented. He is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to sit down and say, \"Well, son, we are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have  fish  today.  Let  us  have  dried\r\n\r\nprawns.\" So, somehow or other, he will have to take\r\n\r\nit  out  from  his  employer. The  consequences  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  taxation, so that the poor people  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay more, will be that they will have  to\r\n\r\ndemand  higher  wages; and if  they  demand  higher\r\n\r\nwages,   then  there  will  be  higher   costs   of\r\n\r\nproduction and sooner or later you may not be  able\r\n\r\nto  compete with manufactures from other countries.\r\n\r\nSupport your local industry when probably you  will\r\n\r\nbe  manufacturing just sufficient  for  your  local\r\n\r\nconsumption  and  will not be able  to  export - that\r\n\r\nwill be a sorry state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the tax on driving licences,\r\n\r\nSir. It  is  again a very small  sum.  Who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  an extra $3 a year? It works out to exactly\r\n\r\n25  cents a month, so said the Financial Secretary.\r\n\r\nAn  extra few dollars for petrol; another extra few\r\n\r\ndollars  for  tobacco; and with the  spiralling  of\r\n\r\nprices and inflation and so on, again it hurts  the\r\n\r\nworkers.

But  I affirm that the increase  of  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  fees  is  a  taxation which  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\ngetting money not from those who can afford it  but\r\n\r\nfrom  the  general masses. It will hurt them  to  a\r\n\r\ngreater or lesser degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we heard that there would be an\r\n\r\nincrease  of only five cents per gallon on  petrol.\r\n\r\nThat  would not hurt. Five cents would not  matter.\r\n\r\nEverybody could afford to pay an extra five  cents.\r\n\r\nThen  this year we are told that there will  be  an\r\n\r\nincrease of seven cents per gallon on petrol.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  find it very tiring to hear that whatever  other\r\n\r\npeople  do,  we  must do. Whether it  is  right  or\r\n\r\nwrong, let us do it. Why? Because somebody else has\r\n\r\ndone  it.  Sir, my argument is this: last year  the\r\n\r\nincrease  on  petrol was five cents a gallon;  this\r\n\r\nyear  it  is seven cents; next year it  may  be  20\r\n\r\ncents; another year it may be 40 cents; and  so  on\r\n\r\nwe  keep on adding, and each time we are told it is\r\n\r\nonly  a small increase. Sir, as an example, let  us\r\n\r\ntake  a  piece of cake. If we keep, on cutting  off\r\n\r\nsmall  pieces,  there must come a time  when  there\r\n\r\nwill be no more cake left. If the tax on petrol  is\r\n\r\nincreased,  but  we  have a good  transport  system\r\n\r\nwhereby everybody can get a bus easily, then I will\r\n\r\nnot quarrel with that, but our transport system  is\r\n\r\nhorrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Hear, hear!

Now that\r\n\r\nis  the  state of affairs prevailing. There  is  no\r\n\r\ngood   transport  system.  Therefore,  small   cars\r\n\r\ncosting  $3,000 or $4,000 each, with a  consumption\r\n\r\nof  50 miles a gallon or so, are an essential  part\r\n\r\nof  the  transport  system, and although  they  are\r\n\r\nprivate transport in that they carry the owners  or\r\n\r\nthe  owners'  friends, still  they  assist  in  the\r\n\r\ntransport system. Sir, if these small private  cars\r\n\r\nwere   to  break  down  and  thereby  prevent   the\r\n\r\ntransport of children to school, imagine the  chaos\r\n\r\nthat  would take place. I think it did happen once.\r\n\r\nEven with the use of lorries, how many hours do you\r\n\r\nthink  it  will take to bring the children  to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  their  schools?  Sir, the  increased  tax  on\r\n\r\npetrol  will definitely affect transport.  In  this\r\n\r\ncase,  it will, of course, affect the middle  class\r\n\r\nof  people,  those who own small cars for  a  small\r\n\r\nfamily.  But  to  those who are in  the  very  high\r\n\r\nincome group, whether petrol is going to cost $2 or\r\n\r\n$3  or  $5  or  $10  a gallon, it does  not  matter\r\n\r\nbecause money comes in easily and they have  enough\r\n\r\nto  eat, to entertain their friends and also enough\r\n\r\nto spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there is the tax on gin and rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Of  course,\r\n\r\nif we tax more from this bracket of people, then we\r\n\r\nneed to tax less from the higher income group.

Whether that car is going to  cost  you\r\n\r\n$3,000  or $7,000 or $10,000 or $20,000, it is  ten\r\n\r\nper  cent tax. I do not quarrel with that. I do not\r\n\r\nsay that car tax is wrong. In fact, I think car tax\r\n\r\nis  quite  right, but I just want you to  think  in\r\n\r\nthis  fashion.  We have many people  who  are  just\r\n\r\nearning  an  income of $400 or $500  a  month,  and\r\n\r\nbecause of the present transport difficulties, they\r\n\r\nsave up to buy a car. I ask you, Sir, how long will\r\n\r\nit  take  a  middle-class wage-earner  to  save  up\r\n\r\n$4,000 to buy a car? It takes a lot of time. If the\r\n\r\ntax  is  increased another ten per cent,  it  means\r\n\r\nanother  ten  per  cent of the time  to  save  that\r\n\r\nmoney. What is about to be within his reach is  now\r\n\r\na  little  further away. Let us  then  see  how  it\r\n\r\naffects  the  people  who are  going  to  buy  cars\r\n\r\ncosting  $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000. They will  go\r\n\r\nto  the salesroom and tell the manager to show them\r\n\r\nthe  best cars. \"$11,000? Oh, just send me the  car\r\n\r\nand  I will sign a cheque for it.\" There is no such\r\n\r\nneed  for saving. The money is there ready. Whether\r\n\r\nthe  increased tax is ten per cent or  fifteen  per\r\n\r\ncent,  it does not affect them very much. It  would\r\n\r\nhave  been saner and more acceptable to the  public\r\n\r\nif such taxation were done on a sliding scale, like\r\n\r\nthat  of income tax. You put a tax of five per cent\r\n\r\non  a  car costing. $4,000 c.i.f.; ten per cent  on\r\n\r\none that costs $6,000 or $7,000 c.i.f.; 15 per cent\r\n\r\non  one that costs $8,000 or so; and 25 per cent or\r\n\r\n30  per  cent  on one ranging between  $10,000  and\r\n\r\n$20,000 c.i.f. Taxation on such a scale would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  fairer  and more acceptable;  something  that\r\n\r\nwould  go along with Government's declared  policy.\r\n\r\nHow often must I remind them of their policy, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cap it all, Sir, the Government say that they\r\n\r\nmust  have luxury tax.

Needless  to\r\n\r\nsay,   over  40  per  cent  will  go  to   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments, and we are still looking forward to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  streamline  its  service  with  its\r\n\r\nmethods advisers and all sorts of advisers in order\r\n\r\nto   have  increased  efficiency  at  lesser  cost.\r\n\r\nFurther,  a  lot  of money will go  into  what  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary has said  at  page  2  of  his\r\n\r\nBudget  speech - change  of  ideas  and  plans.   The\r\n\r\nrelevant part reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In some cases, sites have proved more unstable\r\n\r\nthan  was  originally thought and extensive  piling\r\n\r\nand  preparation has been required.

Everytime there is a\r\n\r\nchange  of plans, there is an additional unforeseen\r\n\r\nexpenditure. If Government cannot make up its mind,\r\n\r\nthen  I say that it is government inefficiency  and\r\n\r\ngovernment shortsightedness. When Government wishes\r\n\r\nto build a hospital, it visualises one that will be\r\n\r\ngrand   and   beautiful  and  equipped  with   air-\r\n\r\nconditioning  plants, rest rooms  for  doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses, and rooms for V.I.P. visitors who might  be\r\n\r\ngoing round the hospital; and so we have a hospital\r\n\r\nbuilt at a cost of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring  previous debates I have pointed out to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that a hospital is built  primarily  to\r\n\r\nheal  people,  and if you build cheap hospitals  on\r\n\r\nthe  model of the old Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  they\r\n\r\nwill  still cure, they will still heal people,  and\r\n\r\npeople will still flock to them to be treated. This\r\n\r\nis  the  case where, if you build a cheap hospital,\r\n\r\nit   will  not  give  the  particular  V.I.P. the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  declaring it  open  in  a  flowery\r\n\r\nspeech. Other reasons have been given. One is  that\r\n\r\nspace  is  limited  and  therefore  we  must  build\r\n\r\nupwards. I tell you, Sir, there is plenty of  space\r\n\r\nand  land.  There is still cheap land going  around\r\n\r\nand  Government can acquire it if it  acts  quickly\r\n\r\nenough,  and will not be short-sighted  until  the\r\n\r\nprice  has gone up further. Of course, we now  have\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Acquisition  Ordinance  to  protect  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  since  we  have   that   measure,\r\n\r\nGovernment  should exercise it and save  the  money\r\n\r\nthat  is contributed by the public. The Government,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  say it again, should try and make  up  its\r\n\r\nmind  on everything, so that there need not be  any\r\n\r\nchange of plans or any change of ideas. I say  this\r\n\r\nbecause  Government expects the  people  with  whom\r\n\r\nthey are dealing not to change their plans and  not\r\n\r\nto  change  their  ideas. If a certain  institution\r\n\r\ncomes  along  to  the  Government  and  submits  an\r\n\r\nestimate  of  a  plan  it has  in  mind  and  tells\r\n\r\nGovernment  that it wishes the plan to  be  carried\r\n\r\nout  in  a certain fashion and asks for a grant  of\r\n\r\n$10,000,  the Government, after studying  the  plan\r\n\r\nand  changing  it and slashing the  estimate,  will\r\n\r\nsay, \"All right, the plan is now acceptable and  we\r\n\r\nwill  give you $8,000.\" But in the case of  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public, they cannot however  change  their\r\n\r\nplans  and change their ideas, because if they  do,\r\n\r\nthen  those  plans  will go through  only  after  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  ten  more years. Of course,  being  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it has the privilege of being  able  to\r\n\r\nchange  its  plans  and its ideas  whenever  it  is\r\n\r\nsuitable. But I say to Government, try and  set  an\r\n\r\nexample to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further money, Sir, is going to be poured into\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust in the  matter  of\r\n\r\nloans, and some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  loans,  we have been told,  Sir,  will  be\r\n\r\nchanged  in that reference to them will not  appear\r\n\r\nin  the Estimates.

He will be able  to\r\n\r\nbuild  them  without  having  to  have  a  planning\r\n\r\noffice, a manager, and a big car park, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAll these are additions that contribute to the high\r\n\r\ncost of S.I.T. buildings. Do away with all that. Do\r\n\r\nnot  make  the organisation too top heavy  and  the\r\n\r\nstage  will be reached where the S.I.T. can  build\r\n\r\nhouses  that are comparable with those produced  by\r\n\r\nprivate builders. This is not just criticism,  Sir.\r\n\r\nI am pointing out facts. If the Government is wise,\r\n\r\nit  should  take note of such facts and investigate\r\n\r\nthem. Only then will it be justified in putting  up\r\n\r\nloans and spending more of the people's money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the assessment that is levied on\r\n\r\npeople who own houses. Middle-class people do  find\r\n\r\nit  difficult to build their own houses. They  have\r\n\r\nno  money,  so  they  go along to  the  co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  and ask for a loan to buy a house.  They\r\n\r\nthen  move  into  their house which  is  mortgaged.\r\n\r\nThere  is a housing shortage and Government  should\r\n\r\nencourage people to own their own houses. If it  is\r\n\r\nto  do this, it must offer some sort of inducement.\r\n\r\nSir, I will talk about Serangoon Garden Estate.  In\r\n\r\nthat  place  they are going to raise  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nassessment to round about $750. I know  of  a  case\r\n\r\nwhere the rent is assessed at $250 a month, and  20\r\n\r\nper  cent of that is $50 a month assessment.  If  a\r\n\r\nperson who owns such a house is going to pay $50 on\r\n\r\nassessment  alone,  then I think  he  would  rather\r\n\r\nprefer to live in a cubicle, and let the Government\r\n\r\nsolve  its  own housing problem. But  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nGovernment will not be able to solve it because its\r\n\r\ncosts  will  be  too  high.  I  believe  that   the\r\n\r\nassessment  rate  for people who own  and  live  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  houses should be as low as possible.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Government, in reply to this,  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"We  are  not  levying such  heavy  taxes  on\r\n\r\neverybody, but we are only levying them  on  people\r\n\r\nwho  rent  out their houses.\" But I say, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  tax that Government levies even on people  who\r\n\r\nlive in their own houses is still too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh.  This  is one way, and a very  good  way,  of\r\n\r\ndiscouraging people from owning houses and one  way\r\n\r\nof justifying how Government can spend more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look into another big item in the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Although it is important to know  where\r\n\r\nthe  money  has gone to, I think the more important\r\n\r\nthing is where the money should go into but did not\r\n\r\nget  into  the Estimates. We are now going  to  see\r\n\r\nwhere the Government has omitted the very important\r\n\r\nthings. On page 5, paragraph 2 of his Budget speech\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It will be noted that no provision is made for\r\n\r\nthe cost of Malayanisation ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  thought  that  Malayanisation  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  point in the government  programme.  Why\r\n\r\nhas it not got into the Estimates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Read further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Are we to believe, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no Malayanisation? Are we  going  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that the speed is going to be slowed  down?\r\n\r\nOf  course,  there was a rumour - but it was  only  a\r\n\r\nrumour - that  $20 million was going to be  spent  on\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, but so long as I do not see  it  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget, then I know that the idea is still  in\r\n\r\nthe  formulation stage, and if it is in this stage,\r\n\r\nthe  Government, we know, has already shown us that\r\n\r\nit  is  always  able to change its  plans  and  its\r\n\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at another item: no provision for\r\n\r\nthe nationalisation of transport. Last year we were\r\n\r\ntreated to a very good debate on transport and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications and Works stated  that\r\n\r\nit  was  socialist policy to nationalise transport,\r\n\r\nbut  in  order  to  do it, we  must  not  move  too\r\n\r\nquickly.  Of course, there has been another  change\r\n\r\nof  plans  and ideas by the Labour Front  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment.    \"Yes,    socialism    believes    in\r\n\r\nnationalisation of transport, but for us we can  be\r\n\r\nslow about it, we cannot take it too seriously when\r\n\r\nit comes to practice. Let us go slow on that.\" This\r\n\r\nyear when the Minister for Communications and Works\r\n\r\nspent some of the public's money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  took a trip to the United Kingdom to study the\r\n\r\ntransport  system of London, that gave me  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  encouragement and I said, \"Soon  we  will\r\n\r\nhave a transport system comparable with the best in\r\n\r\nthe  world.\" Of course, when we have that hope,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have figures to support that hope. So I  look\r\n\r\nthrough the Budget Estimates from the beginning  to\r\n\r\nthe end, searching diligently under every head, but\r\n\r\nI  find  no  provision for the  nationalisation  of\r\n\r\ntransport.  When,  Sir,  will  nationalisation   of\r\n\r\ntransport come into being? Is there going to  be  a\r\n\r\ndelay? I suppose it will be implemented when we -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Have you read the White Paper?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> White Paper or no White\r\n\r\nPaper, Sir, the most important thing is whether  it\r\n\r\ngets into this Budget. If it does not get into  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  it is still in the realm of ideas.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot even going to be a bit realistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision, Sir, which has been\r\n\r\nleft  out, probably after serious thought, and that\r\n\r\nis:  by next year we shall have in Singapore a  few\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils and a City Council with  a  mayor\r\n\r\nfreely  elected. I put it to you, Sir,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nstep  forward  in  our constitutional  development.\r\n\r\nThis is the right direction where we should go.  We\r\n\r\nshould first establish our local councils and  then\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able to tell the world  that  we  can\r\n\r\nmanage our own local affairs. Give us the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and we will be able to manage it as well.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is no provision in this Budget. Are\r\n\r\nwe  going to have our local councils or are we not?\r\n\r\nIt  looks  as though we are not going to  have  our\r\n\r\nlocal  councils.  It  looks  as  though  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  whose life the Government has  prolonged,\r\n\r\nfirst, for one year -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> To our regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - and then for two years, is\r\n\r\nnow going to prolong it for another year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> To our greater regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We will talk about that, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen we come to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate  on  that  Bill and then the Government  can\r\n\r\nhave  its  say. But whatever it is, I protest  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  provision made for local  government\r\n\r\nexpenditures.  We still have the old  Rural  Board.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a case of the greatest importance  and\r\n\r\nit  does  point out that in all probability  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government is occupied with  something\r\n\r\nelse - what  it  is, I do not know,  maybe  something\r\n\r\nairy - and has forgotten the most important thing.  I\r\n\r\nsay, if this is the case, it is inefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look again, Sir, into another item. It is\r\n\r\none  that  has  been  provided  but  insufficiently\r\n\r\nprovided.  I  am looking through only  one  or  two\r\n\r\nitems,  I am not looking through the whole  lot.  I\r\n\r\njust  pick them out at random. Probably by scrutiny\r\n\r\nI  can  pick out more. I am now on education. There\r\n\r\nis   a  disparity  in  the  treatment  afforded  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools  and  that  offered  to   aided\r\n\r\nschools.  Where  Government schools are  concerned,\r\n\r\neverything is being paid for. In the case of  aided\r\n\r\nschools,  there is a scheme whereby it is a  dollar\r\n\r\nfor  a dollar contribution. Here then, Sir, we have\r\n\r\ntwo  categories of schools - Government  schools  and\r\n\r\naided schools. Regarding aided schools, the parents\r\n\r\nof  the students, who have already been taxed, must\r\n\r\nbe  further taxed by contributions to the  schools,\r\n\r\nso  that  they  can progress. As for  the  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff,  I will not say much about them and  I  will\r\n\r\ndeclare my interest, because I am a teacher myself!\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, we have the Government schools\r\n\r\nwhere  everything  necessary  is  provided  for  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There  is  a  scheme  of  service  for\r\n\r\neverybody  and  so they are all  happy.  I  do  not\r\n\r\ngrudge  that. But what I am thinking  of  is  this:\r\n\r\ncontrol  comes from right at the top.  Palmer  Road\r\n\r\ncontrols  every school. One directive  from  Palmer\r\n\r\nRoad  and all schools will obey that directive.  It\r\n\r\nlooks to me as if there is too much centralisation.\r\n\r\nIt  looks  to  me as if the Government schools  are\r\n\r\ngoing to train students who will probably behave in\r\n\r\nexactly the same way if a certain external stimulus\r\n\r\nis  applied; but as my hon. Friend the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works has once said,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  living in a democracy and we do  not  want\r\n\r\neverybody to be thinking in the same vein. Each one\r\n\r\nmust  have his own will. I think the time has  come\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to adopt an education  policy  which\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  too  centralised, that  each  school\r\n\r\nshould  be governed by a Board of Governors - whether\r\n\r\nit  is Government, or Government-aided - and all  the\r\n\r\nschools are under one central organisation. I would\r\n\r\nask the Government not to be afraid of this because\r\n\r\nwe  already  have an example in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  and  if we do that, it will  be  one  step\r\n\r\nforward towards democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I heard the Hon. the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nmention  just  now  the  Chinese  High  School.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, that has been a pet subject for quite  some\r\n\r\ntime  for  many Members in this House. Some  people\r\n\r\ntake a great liking to it, while others do not. But\r\n\r\nlet  me  explain to the Government, Sir - I  am  only\r\n\r\ntrying  to  be helpful - the attitude of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool  students, and if the Government will listen\r\n\r\ncarefully  to  what  I have  to  say,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nbenefited and probably we will not have  any  more\r\n\r\nrioting.  The  Government has  announced  that  all\r\n\r\nschools  will be treated alike. All Chinese schools\r\n\r\nwill be given full grant in aid. Yes, Sir, that  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a  very good step forward. That  is  indeed\r\n\r\ncommendable;  but so far as I can gather  from  the\r\n\r\nschools, from the students, from the teachers,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Press, they do not know  the  conditions\r\n\r\nattached  to such grants in aid. I told  them  that\r\n\r\nthe  grant in aid system would be the same  as  for\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools, but they said that they  had  not\r\n\r\nbeen officially notified. \"We just do not know what\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  is,\" they told me. Will the Government\r\n\r\nnot tell the Chinese people, \"If you have grant  in\r\n\r\naid,  these  are the conditions.\"? Put them  up  in\r\n\r\nblack  and white and I think that will dispel their\r\n\r\nfears. That is my first comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is on the question of salary\r\n\r\nschemes for these Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps I should remind hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that  this is the Second  Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nAppropriation  Bill  and  the  debate   should   be\r\n\r\nconfined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the general principles of Government policy and\r\n\r\nadministration as indicated by the Bill.  What  the\r\n\r\nhon.

But I am glad, Sir, of your guidance  and\r\n\r\nI shall romp along faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of education, Sir, there is another\r\n\r\nmissing item - that of secondary schools. We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave enough secondary schools, and if Government is\r\n\r\ngoing  to produce more technicians and more  people\r\n\r\nwho  will  come and help do the work that Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds, then the answer lies only in the creation of\r\n\r\nmore  secondary schools. It will at least help  the\r\n\r\nstudents to feel a bit safer when they are in  Std. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on education, Sir, we have a paragraph\r\n\r\nin  His  Excellency the Governor's Address  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that the Government will assist the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. How, and in what form will it come?  Is\r\n\r\nit  in  money?  Is  it  in the matter  of  securing\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  so on? We have not heard  anything\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the Estimates or in the  Address.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  public has the right to know  what  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Government is on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the most important section of my\r\n\r\nqueries,  Sir,  and that concerns the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry. On page 3  of  his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  the Financial Secretary has treated  us  to\r\n\r\nthe idea that the Government has thought about \"the\r\n\r\nexpanding economy of Singapore\". On page  11  there\r\n\r\nis  also  a reference to Singapore being  \"a  great\r\n\r\ncommunications  and  trading  centre\",  with   \"its\r\n\r\nmanufacturing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities\".  But,  Sir,  although  the  Government\r\n\r\ntalks about the expanding economy of Singapore, yet\r\n\r\nthe policy that has been adopted so far is one that\r\n\r\nis not going to make the trade and industry of this\r\n\r\ncountry   expand   but  contract.   The   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary, on the one hand, tries to point  out  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  that  the financial  position  of  the\r\n\r\ncolony  is  sound  and  that  occurs  a  number  of\r\n\r\ntimes - on pages 3, 7, 10 - but I will not quote  them.\r\n\r\nTo  say  it  so many times I think he is trying  to\r\n\r\nconvince  himself.  I  hope  it  is  true,  because\r\n\r\nanything that is true need be said only once. Then,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, he says that  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  bleak and that we must  expect  more\r\n\r\ntaxation, and taxation will climb up and up and up.\r\n\r\nThis,  I  think, is contrary to the principles  and\r\n\r\nthe  policy  laid down by the Ministry of  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  which is trying to  say  to  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors,  \"Do  not  be afraid.  Come  right  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  you  will make  huge  profits.  The\r\n\r\nfuture  is  bright. Everything is going to  be  all\r\n\r\nright. We are not going to increase company tax. We\r\n\r\nare  going  to  assist small-scale industries.\"  In\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  one most important thing  that  has\r\n\r\nalways  been in my mind is that whatever  Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufactures   cannot   be   competitive   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation. I am now made to understand that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  tax barrier set up at Johore Bahru and  that\r\n\r\nanything, whether it is manufactured in Hongkong or\r\n\r\nGreat Britain or Australia or Singapore, if it ever\r\n\r\ngets through that barrier, must pay tax. And if  it\r\n\r\nmust  pay  tax,  it  will  mean  higher  costs   to\r\n\r\nconsumers  in  the Federation. It  will  mean  that\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   concerns   will   not   remain   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is natural that they will  remove  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur and sooner or later, Sir,  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen? Will Singapore be a great industrial colony\r\n\r\nlike  Hongkong or will it be reduced to just a port\r\n\r\nof  call and a communications centre? If nothing is\r\n\r\ndone in this direction, then I share the opinion of\r\n\r\nthe   Financial  Secretary  that  the   future   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be bleak. We must create conditions\r\n\r\nthat  will be bright for investment. We must create\r\n\r\nstable conditions and a sense of security, and then\r\n\r\ninvestors  will  come to Singapore.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter of tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  super  tax or non-resident tax that will  chase\r\n\r\npeople away. Sir, the Government will admit that it\r\n\r\nhas  invested the money of Singapore in the  London\r\n\r\nmarket,  and I have been told times without  number\r\n\r\nthat London is about the most heavily taxed country\r\n\r\nin  the  world  and yet we have our money  invested\r\n\r\nthere,  as  if we must not do this and we  must  do\r\n\r\nthat.  What are required to attract investment  are\r\n\r\nstable  conditions, no fluctuations in  the  market\r\n\r\nand no rapid wage rises (because the cost of living\r\n\r\nis  not  rising rapidly). There must be a sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity.  If  we  do not have money  upsets,  then\r\n\r\ninvestors  will  come. There  is,  of  course,  one\r\n\r\nheartening bit of news which I must not leave  out,\r\n\r\nand that is, the Government thinks that it is going\r\n\r\nto  assist small-scale industries by voting the sum\r\n\r\nof  $1 million. We want to know what the Government\r\n\r\nis  going  to do with that $1 million.  How  is  it\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be handled? How will the people affected\r\n\r\nbe  benefited? Will the loans out of  that  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  be firmly controlled and yet elastic  enough\r\n\r\nso that they will be paid back? For this, the plans\r\n\r\nshould be made public. People will wish to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more comment about commerce and industry. The\r\n\r\nGovernment, I feel, should take the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nhave discussions with the Federation Government  to\r\n\r\nsee  that goods manufactured in Singapore  are  not\r\n\r\nsubjected to tax, and if that is not possible, then\r\n\r\nthere  must  at least be some sort of  Commonwealth\r\n\r\npreferential rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

All this taxation must  be\r\n\r\nremoved. But, on the other hand, he shouts  at  the\r\n\r\ntop  of  his voice that we must have all the social\r\n\r\nservices increased. But where do we find the money?\r\n\r\nProbably  the  hon. Member is talking  through  his\r\n\r\nhat!\"  But  I  have  this  to  say,  Sir. In   the\r\n\r\nmanagement of money, the most important thing is to\r\n\r\ncut  down  unnecessary  expenditure.  I  will  just\r\n\r\nmention  one item - it will be good enough. There  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be a large P.W.D. building coming up.  It\r\n\r\nwill cost a few million dollars, say, in the region\r\n\r\nof  $7 million, and the Government is going to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  architect 7\u00bd per cent on that. Work that  out\r\n\r\nand  see  how much that 7\u00bd per cent comes to.  Why\r\n\r\ncannot Government table a Bill which will lay  down\r\n\r\na  sliding  scale  of fees for architects?  If  you\r\n\r\nbuild  a house for $1,000, you get $75. But if  you\r\n\r\nbuild  a  house  for 1,000 times that  $1,000,  you\r\n\r\nshould not get $75 times 1,000; and if the building\r\n\r\nis  going to cost $7 million, and working it out on\r\n\r\nthis  percentage, I think it is a bit too  much  to\r\n\r\nask  people to pay. If, however, you can engage  an\r\n\r\narchitect  to work on a salary scale  of  $1,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth flat, you will probably have him working  for\r\n\r\nquite  a  number  of  years,  in  fact.  Now  after\r\n\r\ndisposing   of   this   expenditure,    which    is\r\n\r\nunnecessary,     I     will     mention     another\r\n\r\nitem - inefficiency in gathering  taxes  on  the  old\r\n\r\nbasis. I understand there are departments which say\r\n\r\nthey cannot collect all the taxes they are supposed\r\n\r\nto  collect. They report that such and such an area\r\n\r\nhas still so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  years of arrears of taxes to be collected.  I\r\n\r\nam referring to the Land Office. Here we have over-expenditure  and inefficiency in collecting  taxes,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that there is a lack of money  and\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  is  being asked to  approve  a  new\r\n\r\ntaxation  scheme. I say all this is not  necessary,\r\n\r\nand, of course, it is ridiculous to tell me that in\r\n\r\nSingapore  there  are only 19,000  people  who  are\r\n\r\npaying  tax. There must be many more. Step  up  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of that department and then we will come\r\n\r\nto  the  stage where we can manage our own  affairs\r\n\r\nwithout unduly increasing taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.52 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  a debate which promises to be of  mammoth\r\n\r\nlength, I will endeavour to be brief. Although  the\r\n\r\nBudget   introduced  by  the  Hon. the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  one  of  the most  stringent  in  my\r\n\r\nexperience, I personally doubt that the outlook  is\r\n\r\nquite  as  gloomy  as  he suggests.  The  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary in his speech said that there is always a\r\n\r\ntendency to estimate revenue conservatively, and he\r\n\r\nmight well have added to over-estimate expenditure.\r\n\r\nThis  point  has been elaborated by the Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  who  also pointed out  that  year  after\r\n\r\nyear,  when  it  comes to the  final  balance,  the\r\n\r\nactual position is far better than anticipated. But\r\n\r\nI  think  there  might  be a danger  here  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly and the public as a whole falling into the\r\n\r\nerror  of  thinking  that  additional  taxation  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary and that Government's fiscal policy  is\r\n\r\nultra-conservative.  The Member for  Serangoon,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,   did  not  mention  that  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary had pointed out that under-expenditure is\r\n\r\nfrequently  deferred  expenditure  and   that   the\r\n\r\ncolony's  development plans are estimated  to  cost\r\n\r\n$310  million over the next six years. He said that\r\n\r\nthe  graph  of expenditure is rising in a  straight\r\n\r\nline  through the origin, but he omitted to mention\r\n\r\nthat  the graph of revenue is unfortunately rapidly\r\n\r\nlevelling  out. On practically every  page  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates we read \"increase due to so and so\",  and\r\n\r\nit seems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto me, Sir, that the chances of the word \"decrease\"\r\n\r\nbeing   substituted   for  \"increase\"   in   future\r\n\r\nestimates are practically zero. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe   colony's   position  is,  as  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  said on three occasions,  sound.  I\r\n\r\nwould go further. I would say that a situation that\r\n\r\nreveals net liquid assets of $130 million is a most\r\n\r\nsatisfactory state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heartily welcome the changes in accounting\r\n\r\nmethods   described  by  the  Hon. the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary in his speech, especially the removal  of\r\n\r\nthe  long-term unrealizable loans from  the  Assets\r\n\r\nside  of  the  Statement of Assets and Liabilities,\r\n\r\nand the reduction of the General Revenue Balance to\r\n\r\n$70  million following the transfer of the  balance\r\n\r\nof the colony's liquid resources to a reconstituted\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. I think that will be regarded  by\r\n\r\nall accountants and business men as a very sensible\r\n\r\nway  of drawing up the colony's Statement of Assets\r\n\r\nand Liabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also greatly interested, Sir, as I presume\r\n\r\nall hon. Members were, in the Financial Secretary's\r\n\r\nremarks  on  the conclusions reached by Sir  Sydney\r\n\r\nCaine  in  his  assessment of the  colony's  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment  requirements, which, financially,  are\r\n\r\nof  a magnitude that is truly staggering. Yet,  Sir\r\n\r\nSydney Caine considers that the funds can be raised\r\n\r\nprovided  that certain conditions be  met.  Of  the\r\n\r\nfour  suggested means essential to  the  growth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the most difficult of attainment, to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Sir,  is  the fourth item mentioned  by  Sir\r\n\r\nSydney Caine. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Local capital resources are mobilised to the\r\n\r\nfull,  a  suitable  climate and  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ninvestment are created, and the general  public  is\r\n\r\nmade  to  realise  the  necessity  of  saving   and\r\n\r\ninvestment in Government loans in order  to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe services which it wants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this can be done, Sir, but it certainly\r\n\r\ninvolves  a more realistic attitude by the  general\r\n\r\npublic to these matters than we have hitherto seen,\r\n\r\nand  their co-operation is essential if \"a  suitable\r\n\r\nclimate   and  opportunities  for  investment   and\r\n\r\nsaving\" are to be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Hon. the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce   and  Industry  prior  to  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary's speech on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppropriation  Bill is particularly  apposite,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  he has said has been warmly welcomed  by  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community of Singapore. It is also  vital,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the general public should  be  made  to\r\n\r\nrealise  the  necessity for saving and  investment,\r\n\r\nand  particularly in Government loans; and  here  I\r\n\r\nhope  we  shall  see some change of heart,  because\r\n\r\nonly  by a change of heart can this be realised.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  that Government can  offer  further\r\n\r\nfinancial  inducements  in order  that  the  public\r\n\r\nshould be attracted to investment in local loans. I\r\n\r\nshould also like to mention, Sir, that when  I  say\r\n\r\n\"the general public\", I mean the general public.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not,  for instance, mean banks who,  when  they\r\n\r\ntake  up large blocks of colony loans and municipal\r\n\r\nloans  at  the  time  they are  issued,  are  doing\r\n\r\nnothing to solve the problems of inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to refer to the first of\r\n\r\nSir Sydney Caine's recommendations, namely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government revenue is increased by stages over\r\n\r\nthe  next three years, including 1957, to yield  at\r\n\r\nleast  an  additional  $50 million  by  1959,  thus\r\n\r\nallowing  a  more  substantial  contribution   from\r\n\r\nrevenue to development than is made at present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is indeed a formidable task and will certainly\r\n\r\ninvolve  the  belt  tightening that  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  referred  to in his  speech,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering  if the untapped potential  to  which  he\r\n\r\nreferred   is  as  great  as  has  been  suggested.\r\n\r\nNevertheless - and I say this as an Independent and I\r\n\r\nam not making this a Party speech - in devising means\r\n\r\nby which revenue can be increased by $20 million in 1957, I think Government is to be congratulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, to comment briefly on some of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  measures for increased taxation.  It\r\n\r\nwould  not  be seemly for me to state  that  nobody\r\n\r\nwould  suffer hardship by a reduction  in  personal\r\n\r\nrelief  from  $3,000 to $2,500, but I  should  have\r\n\r\nthought  that,  in  view  of  the  fact  that   the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary said the average amount  to  be\r\n\r\npaid would be a dollar per head per mensem no  one\r\n\r\nwould suffer extreme hardship as has been suggested\r\n\r\nin  the  Press.  I  should really  have  been  more\r\n\r\ninterested,  Sir,  to  find  out  whether,  as  the\r\n\r\nFinancial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary himself suggested, the collection of such\r\n\r\na  small  tax  was  economically  justifiable.  The\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the higher bracket are rational  and\r\n\r\nindeed  overdue, and will not have  the  effect  of\r\n\r\ncausing those affected too much in the way of  belt\r\n\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaving company tax where it is, Government\r\n\r\nhas  shown,  I think, a full understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  situation and the need for encouragement  of\r\n\r\nforeign   investment.   In   my   speech   on   the\r\n\r\nAppropriation Bill in this Assembly  last  year,  I\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...it is only natural that one should feel\r\n\r\nrelieved  that  the  Budget  proposals  contain  no\r\n\r\nprovision for increase of income tax, but  that  is\r\n\r\nmerely  a brief respite, as the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nhas been at pains to make clear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan Yew), whom I regret to see is not in the House\r\n\r\nat the moment, came to speak, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the Hon. Mr Sutherland...could not conceal his\r\n\r\nrelief that he was not made to pay what was his due\r\n\r\nand fair share of the taxation of this country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well,  that  is nonsense. Sir, I am  happy  to  say\r\n\r\nthat,  as  far  as  I  am  concerned,  I  am  in  a\r\n\r\nsufficiently  low  bracket as to  be  comparatively\r\n\r\nunaffected by the proposed increase; but  then,  as\r\n\r\nnow, I was really talking about company tax, and  I\r\n\r\nmight  add  that the corporation that I serve  pays\r\n\r\nthe  42\u00bd  per cent, which the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nmentioned,  on its income in Singapore,  as  it  is\r\n\r\nincorporated in the United Kingdom. So,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthere is no question that my remarks are influenced\r\n\r\nby any personal feelings of relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, too, I said in this Assembly that I\r\n\r\nsaw  no  reason why cigarettes should have  escaped\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation, and I personally am glad  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has had the courage  to  raise  the\r\n\r\ntaxes on tobacco and is able thus to anticipate  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of revenue of $9\u00bd million from this,  in\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, very legitimate source of taxation. It\r\n\r\nneed  not  be feared that the anticipated  increase\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  realised.  The  fantastic  taxes  on\r\n\r\ntobacco  in  the United Kingdom have had absolutely\r\n\r\nno effect on the habits of smokers who usually only\r\n\r\nrenounce the habit following a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoronary  thrombosis  or a solemn  warning  by  the\r\n\r\ndoctor that they give it up or else...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad, Sir, that gin too was pulled into the\r\n\r\nnet.  I  am  also on record as having expressed  my\r\n\r\nviews  on  that  last year. In this  connection,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to read one paragraph from the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary's speech which is full of humour as  well\r\n\r\nas gin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the rates of duty on other liquors were\r\n\r\nraised  in  November of last year, no  action  was\r\n\r\ntaken  in respect of rum and gin. There has been  a\r\n\r\ntendency  for the consumption of gin in  particular\r\n\r\nto  decrease  over the previous year  or  two.  The\r\n\r\ntaste  for  gin is fairly specialised. In Singapore\r\n\r\nat  least  it  is  not a potential  substitute  for\r\n\r\nwhisky  or  brandy.  There appeared  to  be  little\r\n\r\ndanger  of any marked switch from whisky or  brandy\r\n\r\nto  gin  as a result of the difference in rates  of\r\n\r\nduty.  On  the  other hand, there  was  a  possible\r\n\r\ndanger - although  not  a  very  grave  one - that  an\r\n\r\nincrease in duty might result in a further decrease\r\n\r\nin consumption of gin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows, Sir, or should know, that whisky\r\n\r\nis  an aristocrat and gin a parvenu, and if such an\r\n\r\nanalogy  is  unacceptable to a Socialist government\r\n\r\nor  to the Royal Navy, I cannot help it; but I hope\r\n\r\nthat  any further taxation on these two life-savers\r\n\r\nwill be levied without any discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in driving licence fees and the\r\n\r\nadditional tax on petrol are unlikely to cause  any\r\n\r\ngreat  hardship, and the raising of the stamp  duty\r\n\r\non  cheques  is  a  comparatively painless  way  of\r\n\r\nraising another $300,000. I was interested to  hear\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon suggest that it  did  not\r\n\r\nmatter to the tuan besar who sat in the back of his\r\n\r\ncar, but the poor syce had to pay his $3 additional\r\n\r\nlicensing   fee.   I  should  have   thought   that\r\n\r\npractically  every tuan besar paid the  licence  of\r\n\r\nhis syce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ten per cent initial registration fee on all\r\n\r\nmotor-cars  registered  for  the  first   time   in\r\n\r\nSingapore - well, Sir, that certainly does bring cars\r\n\r\nof  Commonwealth  registration virtually  into  the\r\n\r\npetroleum-liquor-tobacco class and I have no  doubt\r\n\r\nit will affect the lower middle income group, but I\r\n\r\nthink it is a blow which they will just be able  to\r\n\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  this  is  a  good  Budget.  Certainly  it\r\n\r\nfollows the principle, as far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  direct  taxation is concerned, of  putting  the\r\n\r\nburden on the shoulders of those best able to  bear\r\n\r\nit.

I would like to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  consider  today  to  be  a  good  day  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy and for socialist principles. I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment may well be congratulated, Sir,  on  the\r\n\r\ncourage,  wisdom and the spirit of democracy  which\r\n\r\nit  has shown in listening to the reasonable appeal\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of  Singapore  and  restoring  the\r\n\r\npersonal  allowance on income tax and the  duty  on\r\n\r\nlocally manufactured cigarettes, both of which  hit\r\n\r\nthe small man, in their original form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a suggestion that the\r\n\r\nGovernment conceded these two matters because of  a\r\n\r\nthreat to its existence arising from a split in the\r\n\r\nLabour Front. I should like to say that this  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplete and malicious falsehood The Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nthrough  its  Central Committee and the secretaries\r\n\r\nof  the branches at special meetings convened, made\r\n\r\nit  clear  to the Government that if the Government\r\n\r\ncould not make concessions because of the need  for\r\n\r\nco-operation with the Federation, the Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nboth  in  the  Assembly and outside  the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nwould  continue to give its unswerving  loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Sir, the Labour Front  believe  in\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  cooperation with the Federation  on\r\n\r\neconomic  matters, and co-operation  does  not  mean\r\n\r\ngetting our own way all the time. It means give and\r\n\r\ntake; and if sometimes the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nto sacrifice their own way in order to maintain the\r\n\r\nspirit of co-operation with the Federation,  we  of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  people  of Singapore  will  accept  such\r\n\r\nsacrifice  with good grace.

We say to  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister,  \"Well done! By these  concessions\r\n\r\nwhich  you  have  made  in  co-operation  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation, you have been able to meet  the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the  people and have infused new  life  in  our\r\n\r\nconcept of democracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of family allowance on\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  the  leader of the Liberal-Socialists\r\n\r\nmade much of the Asian approach as though that were\r\n\r\nhis  personal baby and his exclusive property.  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front has always solidly stood  behind  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  wish of the people of Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\napproach to personal allowance on income tax should\r\n\r\nbe  an  Asian approach and not a European approach.\r\n\r\nBut surely, Sir, the House must by now be conscious\r\n\r\nof  the manifold submerged difficulties in the  way\r\n\r\nof  income  tax modifications, and I do  say,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we should be fair to the Government and  give\r\n\r\nit the time necessary to meet these difficulties in\r\n\r\nits honest efforts to meet the wishes of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one who expects to be affected, I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  increased  tax on higher incomes,  and  I  say\r\n\r\nthis, Sir: there is plenty of room for expansion in\r\n\r\nrespect of taxation on excessive incomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of company tax, I have studied\r\n\r\nthe reasons given by the Financial Secretary and  I\r\n\r\nmust  say I am not satisfied. I concede, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nspecial inducement must be given to foreign capital\r\n\r\nin   order  to  encourage  its  activity  in   this\r\n\r\nterritory;  but  only  foreign  capital  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  which  is making a  reasonable  profit.\r\n\r\nWhen  foreign  capital skins our  people  and  when\r\n\r\nforeign capital makes excessive profits, then  that\r\n\r\nis no longer a healthy contribution to our economic\r\n\r\nlife. Tomorrow,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, I hope to receive from the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\ninformation  in answer to a question on  the  Order\r\n\r\nPaper  as  to  the  number of companies  which  are\r\n\r\nmaking  more  than  ten per cent  profit  on  their\r\n\r\ncapital,  and I think this House will be in  for  a\r\n\r\nreal shock. I say to the Financial Secretary, as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen,  I  regret that he has  not  seen  fit  to\r\n\r\nindicate to us the results of his researches on the\r\n\r\npossibility of an excess profits tax, and I do urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to consider the introduction of  an\r\n\r\nexcess profits tax at an early date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the tax on motor vehicles. It is a step\r\n\r\nin  the right direction, although I must confess  I\r\n\r\nfind  myself  in  considerable  sympathy  with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon when  he  says,  \"How  about\r\n\r\nhigher  taxes for more expensive cars?\" I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  the  Financial Secretary  will  welcome  that\r\n\r\nsuggestion  and that it will have the consideration\r\n\r\nit  merits.  I would like to say, Sir,  that  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  question  of revenue and  the  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples  affecting this tax, if the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment is not adequate for its responsibilities\r\n\r\nin  obtaining payments of income tax due, then this\r\n\r\ntax at least will, in indirect fashion, get some of\r\n\r\nthe money of which this country is being cheated. I\r\n\r\nwelcome the tax for one special reason, Sir. It can\r\n\r\nhave a salutary effect if the buyer is made to  pay\r\n\r\nthis ten per cent tax on landed cost direct to  the\r\n\r\nTreasury.  He  will then know how  little  his  car\r\n\r\ncosts and how much profit the motor-car monopoly  is\r\n\r\nmaking.  I  ask  the Government to  make  stringent\r\n\r\nregulations  for payment of this tax by  the  buyer\r\n\r\nand  by  no  other person. I think the  defenceless\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore should know the extent to which\r\n\r\nthey are being skinned by this car combine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point about this tax to which\r\n\r\nI  think I would like to draw the attention of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.   The   Government  quite  rightly   exclude\r\n\r\nomnibuses from the tax, because they are  a  public\r\n\r\nservice.   I   do  not  know  whether  taxis   were\r\n\r\nunintentionally omitted, but it seems to  me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  taxis are a public service and, in so far  as\r\n\r\nmy  information goes, taxi owners are neither  rich\r\n\r\nnor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo they make excessive profits, and I would ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider excluding taxis  and  cars\r\n\r\nwhich are intended to be used as taxis for a period\r\n\r\nexceeding three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say that I warmly welcome\r\n\r\nthe action of the Government in leaving the tax  on\r\n\r\nlocally   manufactured  cigarettes   untouched.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the Member for Serangoon must have  either\r\n\r\nignored the Government Gazette which indicated that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  had  reduced  or  had  waived  its\r\n\r\nintended increase of taxation on that item, or else\r\n\r\nperhaps  he  does not quite follow the language  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazettes. I would not blame  him.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  position  now  truly is  this:  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary, in moving the Second Reading, said  that\r\n\r\nthose  who  cannot afford the cigarettes can  smoke\r\n\r\ncheaper  cigarettes.  As  the  proposal  originally\r\n\r\nstood, there were no cheaper cigarettes. The prices\r\n\r\nof  all  cigarettes were increased, but  today  the\r\n\r\nlocally manufactured cigarettes remain at the  same\r\n\r\nprice  as before and they will be far cheaper  than\r\n\r\nthe  imported cigarettes. Therefore, the  poor  man\r\n\r\nand  the  lower income group can continue to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  friendliness of tobacco without having to make\r\n\r\nany sacrifices and, in addition, Sir, we are giving\r\n\r\na  real direct impetus to local industry. I welcome\r\n\r\nthe increase of tax on imported cigarettes and pipe\r\n\r\ntobacco.   Those   who  will  not   support   local\r\n\r\nindustries,  Sir, should be made to  pay  more  for\r\n\r\ntheir imported cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional tax on petrol has been made much\r\n\r\nof  by the Member for Serangoon. It is his duty  as\r\n\r\nleader  of the majority Party of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nlabour  himself  in  seeking  to  find  grounds  of\r\n\r\ndiscontent and he finds them in the tax on  petrol.\r\n\r\nSir, that tax should not harm anybody at all. I say\r\n\r\n\"should not\", but, in fact, I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon that in one instance of which I have\r\n\r\nheard,  it has been made the excuse by unscrupulous\r\n\r\ncapital to exploit the poor. I understand that  the\r\n\r\nowners  of lorries which carry vegetables to market\r\n\r\nhave  increased their charges from 30 cents a picul\r\n\r\nto  40  cents  a picul. Sir, a lorry,  I  am  told,\r\n\r\ncarries 96 piculs on two voyages for one gallon. So\r\n\r\nthey receive $9.60 extra for every seven cents they\r\n\r\npay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Government. And they blame the Government!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, Sir, I am not at all\r\n\r\nsatisfied or happy about the expenditure on defence\r\n\r\nservices.  I welcome the expenditure on  the  local\r\n\r\nforces.  I  would  like  to  hear  when  our  first\r\n\r\nbattalion will be operative. I would also  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether there is being prepared a plan for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  battalion. But I would  like  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  this  House to that  extraordinarily\r\n\r\nexpensive toy, the Royal Malayan Navy. It has  been\r\n\r\nfreely admitted, Sir, that this organisation is  in\r\n\r\nno  way  related to or utilised for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and it is costing a fantastic packet.  I\r\n\r\nhad  hoped, Sir, that the Financial Secretary would\r\n\r\nhave taken advantage of the question which I put to\r\n\r\nhim, and indicated the policy of Government for the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years  in connection  with  these  very\r\n\r\nexpensive  items on our income. I shall  raise  the\r\n\r\nmatter  again under the appropriate heading in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply and I trust  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  will  be  in a position  to  give  us  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  understanding of this expenditure  to\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are committed of $15 million,  allegedly\r\n\r\nfor  four  mine-sweepers, and more than $4  million\r\n\r\nannually recurrent expenditure on the Royal Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I come to the Legal Aid and Advice\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Let me say, as a citizen and a Member of\r\n\r\nthis  House, how deeply I regret to see that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  provision whatsoever for the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the law of this country for five and  a  half\r\n\r\nmonths. It is right that the people of this country\r\n\r\nshould  obey  the law. It is also the duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  apply the law. The  Legal  Aid  and\r\n\r\nAdvice  Ordinance  is  a truly  socialist  measure,\r\n\r\nwelcomed on all sides in this, at that time, not so\r\n\r\nvery  friendly House. There was not one  dissenting\r\n\r\nvoice. It was welcomed by the entire population. It\r\n\r\nwas  moved by the Hon. the Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock), and, in moving  it,  he\r\n\r\nquoted that cynical remark -\"The Courts of law, like\r\n\r\nthe  Ritz  Hotel,  are open to the  rich  and  poor\r\n\r\nalike!\" Where is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange?  Has  there been any change that  in  these\r\n\r\nfive  and  a  half months nothing but  a  desultory\r\n\r\nconversation or two have taken place to  apply  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of this country, approved fully by this  House\r\n\r\nand  by  the people? The bogey of the Bar Committee\r\n\r\nhas  been put up. I say \"bogey\", Sir, because I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it  is  fair to the  Bar  Committee  to\r\n\r\nsuggest    that   it   seeks   to   obstruct    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this very necessary  measure  for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people of Singapore.  What  the\r\n\r\nBar  Committee is interested in are regulations  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the relation of members of the  Bar  to\r\n\r\nthe  department when they are employed. But the Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee  has never said, \"You cannot establish  a\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Legal Aid and Advice. You  must  not\r\n\r\nappoint  a  Director.  You  must  not  appoint   an\r\n\r\nAssistant Director. You must not have an office.\" I\r\n\r\nam deeply perturbed by the seeming loss of interest\r\n\r\nof  the  Government in this very necessary  measure\r\n\r\nfor  the welfare of the people of Singapore  and  I\r\n\r\nshall revert to it under its appropriate heading in\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also must say, Sir, that I note with regret the\r\n\r\nlack  of  provision for a dynamic approach  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem of enhancing the economic position  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  this  territory,  and  the  absence  of\r\n\r\nprovision for acquiring kampongs and providing  for\r\n\r\ntheir  rehabilitation. A great deal of good can  be\r\n\r\ndone  in that direction at far less cost than  four\r\n\r\nuseless toy minesweepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other subject on which I would\r\n\r\nlike to touch. I do it with some diffidence. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  a change in accountancy  methods\r\n\r\nproposed    by   the   Financial   Secretary    and\r\n\r\nenthusiastically  supported by  a  banker  of  some\r\n\r\nexperience. I therefore tread with some  diffidence\r\n\r\nin  this territory, and I admit quite frankly  that\r\n\r\nall  that  I know of accountancy I learned  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Y.M.C.A. School of Commerce! But  I  must\r\n\r\nsay, Sir, that it goes contrary to the concepts  of\r\n\r\nhonest  book-keeping  that we  should  spirit  away\r\n\r\nmortgages  from the balance sheet, that  we  should\r\n\r\ntreat loans with security, loans on building, loans\r\n\r\non land, as current expenditure. Sir, all of us not\r\n\r\nonly in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  but outside it have the highest respect  for\r\n\r\nthe  absolute integrity of the Financial Secretary,\r\n\r\nbut I would ask whether, in fact, there is any real\r\n\r\nneed  for  it. He suggests that it is necessary  in\r\n\r\nthe name of tidiness. Sir, I do not care how untidy\r\n\r\nit is if I can see my money. I would rather not see\r\n\r\nit  spirited away. Sir, if the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nwants  to  play the magician, I would  ask  him  to\r\n\r\nproduce  rabbits out of his hat and  not  make  our\r\n\r\nmoney  disappear through his hat! I do like to  see\r\n\r\nwhere  my  money  is,  and if it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nseparate liquid from illiquid assets, Sir,  let  us\r\n\r\nauthorise  him  to put, in inch-high  letters,  the\r\n\r\nword  \"Illiquid\" on the assets side of the  balance\r\n\r\nsheet;  but do not spirit away our loans which  are\r\n\r\nvaluable, which can be transferred and sold,  which\r\n\r\nhave  monetary value. Do not let us  hide  them  in\r\n\r\nsome  corner  of these highly complicated  accounts\r\n\r\nwhich  really, let us confess, very few of  us  can\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Sir, my attitude toward  all  this  is\r\n\r\nmerely a feeling of discomfort, but if it is really\r\n\r\nconsidered necessary, I will go along with it;  but\r\n\r\nI  would plead that in that event, at the bottom of\r\n\r\nthe  balance sheet, away in a corner if  necessary,\r\n\r\nwe  should have a note that we have illiquid assets\r\n\r\nof  $126  million - and it is not a sum to be sneezed\r\n\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to join Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland - for   once!   - in   congratulating   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in all sincerity on a Budget which today\r\n\r\nis in a form of which we can be proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The Government is ostensibly a\r\n\r\nSocialist  Government. We heard  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nSocialism   during  those  happy  days   when   the\r\n\r\ngentlemen opposite were wooing the voters but  that\r\n\r\nwas  a  long time ago, Sir. Since then,  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  successfully  brainwashed by  their  colonial\r\n\r\nbackseat drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget, Sir, is proof that the Labour Front\r\n\r\nhas  been  purged of all Socialist deviations.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  is  this  Budget purged  of  every  tinge  of\r\n\r\nSocialism  but  it  is  utterly  shameless  in  its\r\n\r\nconcern  for great business and colonial interests.\r\n\r\nWith  the  Labour Front Government as a front,  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  backseat drivers had tried  to  soak  the\r\n\r\npoor  while  leaving  the rich  untouched.  I  said\r\n\r\n\"tried\",  Sir,  because since the announcements  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget,  there  has been  some  panicky  back-\r\n\r\ntracking.  It  may  be  because  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Government was particularly impressed  by\r\n\r\nthe    Liberal-Socialists.   Even   the    Liberal-\r\n\r\nSocialists, Sir, felt that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget was an attempt to balance the budget at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the lower income workers.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could have told the backseat drivers  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  Budget  which looked like  a  Socialist\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Who were the backseat drivers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Ask yourself. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  the blunder over the lower income groups  has\r\n\r\nbeen  put  right  does  not make  this  Budget  any\r\n\r\nbetter.  In  fact, the protests over the  injustice\r\n\r\ndone  to  the  low  wage  earner  have  only  drawn\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that this is still  a  Budget\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  aid  and  comfort  big  business  and\r\n\r\ncolonial interests. This is certainly not a  Budget\r\n\r\nexpected  of a Party which claims to be  Socialist,\r\n\r\nNationalist or champion of the Welfare  State.  The\r\n\r\nonly  kind of welfare that this Budget will further\r\n\r\nis  capitalist  welfare  and,  in  particular,  the\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget was designed to meet a specific\r\n\r\nproblem  and  that  was  the  $37  million  deficit\r\n\r\nexpected in 1957. This deficit was to be met by the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  income  tax  by  lowering  the  basic\r\n\r\npersonal  allowance which would have hit  hard  the\r\n\r\nlower income group but the higher income group  was\r\n\r\nlet  off very lightly, indeed so lightly that  even\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialists  felt  happy  and  jubilant\r\n\r\nenough to take up the cudgels on behalf of the poor\r\n\r\nwage earner. For a Socialist Government, Sir, - and I\r\n\r\nhope I am not unduly embarrassing the Government by\r\n\r\nassuming  that  it still believes in  its  election\r\n\r\npledges - taxation  is  one  way  of  bringing  about\r\n\r\ngreater  equality of income and Malaya is a country\r\n\r\nwhere  inequality of income prevails. This was  the\r\n\r\nnecessary outcome of a colonial economy. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen no proper survey of distribution of income but\r\n\r\na  survey of urban incomes and housing made not  so\r\n\r\nlong ago suggests that the gap between the rich and\r\n\r\npoor  is considerable. A colonial government  could,\r\n\r\nof  course,  afford  to maintain  this  inequality.\r\n\r\nPeople  do not expect anything better of a colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment but people do expect something better of\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front Coalition Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more glaring instance of partiality to\r\n\r\nvested interests in the Budget was that company tax\r\n\r\nwas  left  untouched.  This  leniency  came  as   a\r\n\r\npleasant surprise to the big companies who had been\r\n\r\nexpecting  increased rates. A few days  before  the\r\n\r\ntax  rates were disclosed, the Straits Times in its\r\n\r\neditorial of November 6 speculated on how  the  $37\r\n\r\nmillion deficit would be met. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The two Malayan Governments are agreed that\r\n\r\nincome  tax rates should be raised, and it must  be\r\n\r\nassumed that the company rate will be increased  as\r\n\r\nwell as the top brackets of individual income tax.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Straits Times is no Socialist paper. It assumed\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour  Front Coalition  Government  was\r\n\r\nSocialist. The Straits Times was wrong for once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point to be considered is how the money\r\n\r\nobtained   by  taxation  is  going  to  be   spent.\r\n\r\nGovernment can spend its money on expanding welfare\r\n\r\nservices like education, hospitals, and so  on,  or\r\n\r\nby  lavish  expenditure on itself. One  reason  why\r\n\r\npeople  are  resentful of taxation is because  they\r\n\r\nare  convinced  that  most of  the  money  goes  on\r\n\r\nconspicuous  consumption by the  bureaucracy.  They\r\n\r\nread  about sumptuous houses for senior members  of\r\n\r\nthe   bureaucracy;  they  read  about  expatriation\r\n\r\nallowances;   they  read  about  the   $5   million\r\n\r\nPolytechnic suddenly costing $11,500,000. When  the\r\n\r\nGovernment builds schools or hospitals, the cost of\r\n\r\nbuildings suggests that they are made not of bricks\r\n\r\nbut   of  marble.  Is  it  any  surprise  that  our\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  is  one  of  the  most  expensive   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to our income? In fact, the ordinary  man\r\n\r\nis keenly aware that he gets relatively little from\r\n\r\nthe Government by way of services in return for the\r\n\r\nlarge  sum of money he spends on the upkeep of  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  on  emoluments, expatriation  pay  and\r\n\r\ntravelling allowances. That was to be expected of a\r\n\r\ncolonial government whose main function was to have\r\n\r\njust a Government to make this country a profitable\r\n\r\ndollar earner. An alien bureaucracy saw no harm  in\r\n\r\nmaking it an expensive bureaucracy as well but that\r\n\r\nis  not good enough for an elected government which\r\n\r\nmust set its standards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  living in relation to economic conditions here.\r\n\r\nThis  Budget,  unfortunately, is no different  from\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  Budget of the  past.  It  keeps  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy happy; it keeps the colonial  investors\r\n\r\nhappy. It is also based on the assumption that this\r\n\r\ncountry must be firmly tied to the apron string  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and that it can, for the  time  being,\r\n\r\nforget all about Socialist principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  supporting  the Member for Serangoon  (Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChoon  Mong) that year in and year out we are faced\r\n\r\nwith  a  Budget  of imaginative figures  showing  a\r\n\r\ndeficit,  I  will draw hon. Members'  attention  to\r\n\r\npages 9 and 13 of the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 9 is the summary of revenue collected\r\n\r\nfrom 1946 to 1955 and on page 13 is the summary  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred from 1946 to 1955.  Comparing\r\n\r\nthe  figures on these two sheets, I find that every\r\n\r\nyear  there is a surplus instead of a deficit  with\r\n\r\nthe exception of 1954. That is why I say that these\r\n\r\nare  really  imaginative figures - just pure  figures\r\n\r\nand no facts at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we were presented with a deficit of\r\n\r\n$15.2  million  in  the Budget and  it  was  really\r\n\r\nsurprising  to  hear  from the Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  in  his speech that we are expecting  on\r\n\r\nactual  working  figures a surplus  of  between  $2\r\n\r\nmillion and $3 million. Is it not contradictory  to\r\n\r\npresent  a  Budget with a deficit of $15.2  million\r\n\r\nwhen, instead of that actual deficit, there will be\r\n\r\na surplus of $2 million to $3 million? We are again\r\n\r\ngiven  a  Budget with a deficit of $37 million  and\r\n\r\nwith  revotes  it amounts to about $39  million.  I\r\n\r\nwill  quote,  Sir,  what  the  Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary had to say about this deficit on  page  5\r\n\r\nof his speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The position therefore is that, against an\r\n\r\nestimate  of revenue of $217 million,  we  have  an\r\n\r\nestimate of expenditure of $254 million, and we are\r\n\r\nfaced with an estimated deficit of $37 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if the position is quite as\r\n\r\nserious as would appear from these figures. As hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware, ever' allowing for  unforeseen\r\n\r\ncalls on public funds which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave arisen during the course of the year - some  of\r\n\r\nthem substantial - actual expenditure has in the past\r\n\r\ninvariably  fallen  short of the  estimate.  It  is\r\n\r\nlikely that this will occur again in 1957.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>From  what I make out of these paragraphs, it would\r\n\r\nappear  that  there is going to be a surplus  again\r\n\r\nfor  1957.  Then why, Sir, put us in a position  so\r\n\r\nthat we will have to approve a deficit Budget every\r\n\r\nyear?  Is  this  an excuse for the Government  that\r\n\r\nthere is no alternative but to increase taxation in\r\n\r\norder  to cover this deficit? If not, then why  not\r\n\r\nbe more realistic and tell us the actual figures of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget? We are placed in such a position  year\r\n\r\nafter  year by the Government telling us  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is on the verge of bankruptcy  and  that\r\n\r\nunless  we  find some ways and means  to  find  the\r\n\r\nmoney  we may have to go bankrupt. I think that  if\r\n\r\nwe  are faced year after year with a deficit figure\r\n\r\nwhich shows the sorrowful state or affairs of this\r\n\r\nisland,  there  is no use for us  sitting  here  to\r\n\r\napprove  Budgets unless the picture is put  clearly\r\n\r\nbefore  us.  I would have expected that the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Coalition Government would  give  us  actual\r\n\r\nfacts rather than mislead us. By misleading us,  we\r\n\r\nget nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now apart from these imaginative figures, there\r\n\r\nare also indications of extravagance in the Budget.\r\n\r\nI  would  refer  to page 33 of the Draft  Estimates\r\n\r\nunder Head 2, item 10 (1)  \"City Services\". You will\r\n\r\nfind  that  the cost of City Services for  Criminal\r\n\r\nDistrict  and  Magistrates' Courts  is  $27,600  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to $3,600 for this year. As I go  down  I\r\n\r\nfind that the reason given is \"Increase due to air-conditioning  of  the  Courts\".  The  increase   of\r\n\r\n$24,000  a  year works out to $2,000  a  month  for\r\n\r\nelectricity  alone and I wonder how  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary got this figure. I am sure that\r\n\r\nthe  eight Courts will not be able to consume about\r\n\r\n12,000  units  a  month,  which  is  a  substantial\r\n\r\nfigure.  The maximum that I could get is  1,000  or\r\n\r\n2,000  units a month but I wonder how  he  got  the\r\n\r\nfigure of 12,000 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer next to page 53 of the Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates  under  Head  8,  item  12  \"Telephones\".\r\n\r\n$12,000 is provided for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Secretary's  Ministry  for  telephones\r\n\r\nalone!

The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  (Mr  Marshall)  said  \"Not\r\n\r\nenough!\" I agree that it is not enough for some  of\r\n\r\nthem  but look at \"Grant to Young Women's Christian\r\n\r\nAssociation, $125,000\". Why forget the Young  Men's\r\n\r\nChristian Association and why give it to the  women\r\n\r\nonly?  It  is  surprising that no Member  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is a woman and, although all the  Members\r\n\r\nhere  belong to the male sex, we are not  providing\r\n\r\nmoney  for  the Young Men's Christian  Association!\r\n\r\nAnd  again  there  is the Chinese  Christian  Young\r\n\r\nMen's Association. If they come to us, are we going\r\n\r\nto  grant them such funds, Sir? I think we have  to\r\n\r\nbe more careful about all this money, and the total\r\n\r\nfor   all   these   grants  is  $768,480 - just   for\r\n\r\nCharitable  Allowances alone, Sir!  This  figure  I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned does  not include family planning at\r\n\r\nall  because  it comes under \"Treasury\"  and  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  grant.  So apart from this  figure,  you\r\n\r\nwill  realise  that  there  are  grants  for  other\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the question of taxation, Sir. As\r\n\r\na  matter  of  fact, taxation may be good  for  the\r\n\r\nState  but we must at times think of the  poor.  On\r\n\r\nthe question of income tax, I am very glad that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has realised its folly and is  going  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe reduction of the $500 personal relief. But I am\r\n\r\nnot  at  all  happy  about  that  yet  because  the\r\n\r\npercentage of income tax that is going to be levied\r\n\r\non  the poorer classes is to be increased. Why  not\r\n\r\nincrease  on  the higher level rather than  on  the\r\n\r\nlower  level?  The Member for Cairnhill  said  this\r\n\r\nmorning  that the Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\nis  fully aware that income tax is to be framed  on\r\n\r\nthe  Asian way of life. I am rather surprised  that\r\n\r\nthe  present Ordinance is framed or copied from the\r\n\r\nWestern way of life. It is entirely different:  how\r\n\r\nan  Asian lives and how a Westerner lives.  In  the\r\n\r\nWestern way of life, as soon as a son gets married,\r\n\r\nthe  relationship with his parents is just cut off.\r\n\r\nHe goes on his own -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - and has a separate family.\r\n\r\nHe  is not considered a member of the family of the\r\n\r\nfather.  He  is  considered a  separate  family  by\r\n\r\nhimself  and  he  has  no more relations  with  nor\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to the parents who  have  brought\r\n\r\nhim  up to the age to get married. But in the Asian\r\n\r\nway  of  life, Sir, we look after our  parents  far\r\n\r\nmore  than our wives. To a Westerner, a wife  comes\r\n\r\nfirst.  Everywhere the wife goes, the husband  must\r\n\r\nfollow  and  respect  her wishes  and  parents  are\r\n\r\nignored,  but  to an Asian, Sir, the  parents  come\r\n\r\nfirst,   the  wife  comes  second,  and  then   the\r\n\r\nchildren.  Unless you have your parents,  you  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  existing in this world. So you  must  help\r\n\r\nyour  parents. The Income Tax Ordinance  should  be\r\n\r\nframed  in such a way as to suit the Asian  way  of\r\n\r\nlife. Now if you have parents who cannot earn money\r\n\r\nor  make a living, and apart from aged parents, you\r\n\r\nhave  your  younger brothers and  sisters  who  are\r\n\r\ndependent on their parents, who is then to  support\r\n\r\nthem?  Is  it not your responsibility as a  son  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  a  brother to the other  members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily to support the whole family?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the reduction of $500 from the\r\n\r\npersonal  relief, as it stands today, the allowance\r\n\r\nof $3,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  inadequate  to meet the cost  of  living  of  a\r\n\r\nworker.   The   $3,000  provided   as   relief   is\r\n\r\ninsufficient for a worker to exist, and  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  $3,000 to $2,500 is really cutting his throat.\r\n\r\nI   would  have  expected  that  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, as Labourites or  Socialists\r\n\r\nwho care more for the workers, would have increased\r\n\r\nthat  amount to $5,000 because, unless you  have  a\r\n\r\nrelief of $5,000, it is impossible to live. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  married person, add another $3,000  as\r\n\r\nrelief, making $8,000 relief. It was fortunate that\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister went to Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nand  got  the  Chief Minister of the Federation  to\r\n\r\nhave  this  withdrawn,  or else  I  am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nworkers  will never be able to exist  at  all,  and\r\n\r\nonly the Ministers will live then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I heard this morning is from one of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  on  the  Government  Benches,  that\r\n\r\nworkers should not possess cars or cannot afford to\r\n\r\nhave  cars. I wonder why? Is it that Ministers only\r\n\r\ncan have motor cars -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> They say that they are working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - and workers cannot have\r\n\r\nmotor cars? Is it in the difference of cars that we\r\n\r\npossess? A Minister can have a $20,000 car, but for\r\n\r\na  worker,  I think he can have a $2,000 or  $3,000\r\n\r\nmotor car - a small car - and the car itself  is  not  a\r\n\r\nluxury. Every time the question of a car comes  up,\r\n\r\nit  is  said, \"Oh, it is a luxury. A worker  should\r\n\r\nnot have it.\" But, Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  realise  that  owning  a  car   is   more\r\n\r\neconomical  than  travelling in  public  transport?\r\n\r\nJust take an instance, Sir: an ordinary worker  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  travel 20 miles a day, and if  he  is  to\r\n\r\ntravel those 20 miles by taxi, which costs 40 cents\r\n\r\nper  mile, it will come to $8 a day. Can  a  worker\r\n\r\nafford $8 a day for transport alone? But if he  has\r\n\r\na  small  car  with a consumption  of  50  miles  a\r\n\r\ngallon, as the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon\r\n\r\nMong)  said, it will cost him less than  a  dollar,\r\n\r\nwhich is ten per cent of the actual expenditure  on\r\n\r\ntransport. Is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit not a necessity? He has to go to work, he has to\r\n\r\ncome home from work, he has to send his children to\r\n\r\nschool, he has to send his wife to the market -  and\r\n\r\nall  those  20 miles just for ten per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nactual  money  that he has got to spend  on  public\r\n\r\ntransport. Why should the workers not have cars? It\r\n\r\nis  absurd!  I am sure that quite a number  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers   on  the  opposite  Benches  were  workers\r\n\r\nbefore.  Today  they  are Ministers  and  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters. Oh, then they can have a car!  But  some\r\n\r\nof  them  were  workers before and  they  had  cars\r\n\r\nbefore they came into this Assembly House. Why  did\r\n\r\nthey  have  cars then? Why not follow the principle\r\n\r\nof  having  no cars at all? I hope, Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will realise this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cigarettes, smoking is not a\r\n\r\nvice nor is it a luxury. It is a habit. I would say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a necessity as well as a  habit,  and\r\n\r\nbecause it is a habit, you cannot get out of it. As\r\n\r\na  necessity then, you must have it, but as a habit\r\n\r\nit is just as bad because it is essential. You must\r\n\r\nsmoke. As a non-smoker myself, I do not care if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  increases the tax  on  cigarettes,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  about  the people who smoke? It is  not  just\r\n\r\nbecause I do not smoke that I will not bother about\r\n\r\nthe  increase of tax on cigarettes. A few cents  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes, a few cents on petrol, a few  cents  on\r\n\r\nthis and a few cents on that a day will not make  a\r\n\r\nfew  cents.  It  will amount to a few  dollars  and\r\n\r\napart  from  those few dollars, the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing to tax again on those few dollars. How can  a\r\n\r\nworker exist? It is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hope that the Government will be more\r\n\r\ncareful  in  presenting the Budget figures  and  in\r\n\r\nproposing  to  increase taxation. I would  not  say\r\n\r\nthat I am against all taxation, but I say, \"Be more\r\n\r\nreasonable and realistic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nconsidering   the  Estimates  for  1957   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's taxation policy, one must be guided by\r\n\r\na  certain number of basic criteria. First of  all,\r\n\r\nnothing must be done to endanger the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition of Singapore as one of the greatest  trade\r\n\r\nand communication centres in the world because,  if\r\n\r\nwe  lose that position, we condemn ourselves  to  a\r\n\r\nslow and painful death. Secondly, the standards  of\r\n\r\nadministration  must be maintained at  the  highest\r\n\r\npitch  of  efficiency because, unless the  services\r\n\r\nprovided by the Government departments in charge of\r\n\r\ntrade and communications are of the best standard,\r\n\r\ncommercial concerns and the world's travellers will\r\n\r\ngo  elsewhere. Thirdly, Singapore must engender  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of confidence and stability which  has,\r\n\r\nin  fact, been considerably shaken during the  last\r\n\r\n18  months. Fourthly, if extra taxation  is  to  be\r\n\r\njustified,  it  must be applied to productive  ends\r\n\r\nwhich  create  employment as  well  as  to  finance\r\n\r\nsocial  services and,  fifthly,  taxation   which\r\n\r\nencourages the inflationary spiral of wages chasing\r\n\r\nprices  and which reduces the purchasing  power  of\r\n\r\npeople  defeats its own ends. Lastly,  and  here  I\r\n\r\ncome  back to the first point because of  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  maintaining Singapore's position as  a trade\r\n\r\nand    communication   centre,   a   much    closer\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and relationship must be  cultivated\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation Government, and I congratulate\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Minister on what he has done  in\r\n\r\nrecent weeks in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far then do the Estimates and the proposed\r\n\r\nincreased  taxes square with the criteria  which  I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned? Let me first turn to the Luxury Tax\r\n\r\nBill  which has been laid before this House.  This,\r\n\r\nat  first  sight, seems to be a reckless plunge  by\r\n\r\nthe Government into a new taxation policy which may\r\n\r\nwell  be  disastrous for this country. Any taxation\r\n\r\nwhich destroys or endangers Singapore's status as a\r\n\r\nfree port and further weakens our entrepot position\r\n\r\nwill  be  suicidal and I am by no  means  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill will avert this danger. Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  go into great details on  this  Bill\r\n\r\ntoday in view of the fact that it can be debated on\r\n\r\nthe Second Reading tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the Government's second thoughts\r\n\r\non  Personal Allowances. It is true that this wise\r\n\r\ndecision  means that several thousand  people  will\r\n\r\nnow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nescape  this income tax, and it is also  true  that\r\n\r\nall income tax payers will benefit to a greater  or\r\n\r\nlesser  degree, but what must not be  forgotten  is\r\n\r\nthat  the rate at the bottom of the scale is  still\r\n\r\nto be raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent and this\r\n\r\nwill mean hardship for an unfortunate minority.  We\r\n\r\nhave  just  emerged from a period  of  strikes  for\r\n\r\nbetter conditions, of negotiations between employer\r\n\r\nand  employee  for  higher  wages,  of  legislation\r\n\r\nlaying down a better deal for the working man,  and\r\n\r\nshortly the clerks and shop assistants, and now the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been on the point of stepping in and\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"We  are entitled to a share of  what  you\r\n\r\nhave  won.\" Could anything be better calculated  to\r\n\r\nupset   confidence  and  to  make   the   task   of\r\n\r\nresponsible trade union leaders more difficult? The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front in its manifesto promised the  people\r\n\r\nof  this  country  the right to  economic  security\r\n\r\nincluding  State  support for the  aged,  sick  and\r\n\r\nunemployed.  They  have not so  far  provided  that\r\n\r\nsupport  in  their one and a half years in  office,\r\n\r\nand  I  do not altogether blame them for that,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are not still happy about is the increase\r\n\r\nin  tax on this lower income group, that is to say,\r\n\r\non  those  who  are  carrying  proportionately  the\r\n\r\nlargest  burden in making contributions from  their\r\n\r\nown   small  salaries  to  their  aged,  sick   and\r\n\r\nunemployed relatives. Not only is there  no  relief\r\n\r\nfor those under obligation by long custom to assist\r\n\r\ntheir parents but there is an increase in the rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the changes which have been made which\r\n\r\nwe naturally welcome, we ask this Government to let\r\n\r\nus  know the following figures during the course of\r\n\r\nthis  debate:  firstly, the  expected  decrease  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  resulting from the decision to  leave  the\r\n\r\nPersonal  Allowances unchanged and,  secondly,  the\r\n\r\nexpected  increase in revenue to  be  derived  from\r\n\r\nraising the rate from three to five per cent in the\r\n\r\nnew  circumstances. I doubt very much  whether  the\r\n\r\nlatter is really worth collecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has surprised me is the fact that the\r\n\r\nestimate  of  revenue from income tax  in  1957  is\r\n\r\nexactly  the same as in 1956, namely, $65  million,\r\n\r\nleaving  aside  the $4 or $5 million  which  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraise through the new increases. Now the House will\r\n\r\nremember  that in March of this year, we  gave  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  very  wide powers so that  \"the  battle\r\n\r\nagainst tax evaders could be effectively waged\", to\r\n\r\nuse the Hon. the Financial Secretary's own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall), speaking\r\n\r\nin  full  responsibility as the Chief  Minister  at\r\n\r\nthat time, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I think it is generally recognised that the\r\n\r\ncountry  is  not getting even 50 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nincome tax to which it is entitled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we have added to our staff three experts from\r\n\r\nthe   British  Board  of  Inland  Revenue  in   the\r\n\r\ndetection of evaders. They are there now  and  they\r\n\r\nare  set for this campaign to get back some of  the\r\n\r\ndreadful loss which we have suffered....\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if  these three gentlemen had  been  set  for\r\n\r\ntheir  campaign after being armed with  new  powers\r\n\r\napproved  by  this  House,  then  we  would  expect\r\n\r\nresults  by 1957. We do not expect them to  recover\r\n\r\nthe 50 per cent which the hon. Member said existed\r\n\r\nbut we would expect them to increase the income tax\r\n\r\nreturns  by an appreciable extent. Sir, I  consider\r\n\r\nthat  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary owes  us  a\r\n\r\nvery  full  explanation as to why the  wide  powers\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Government had not been justified  by\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point about income tax is this. About\r\n\r\n$2,300,000 was the amount of tax realised  in  1955\r\n\r\nfrom  roughly  1,800 non-resident  individuals.  On\r\n\r\nwhat is this tax assessed? Is it assessed only  on\r\n\r\ndividends  paid  by limited companies  or  does  it\r\n\r\ninclude  income  from  rents  and,  more  important\r\n\r\nstill,  from  dividends from private companies  or\r\n\r\npartnerships? I should like to know whether we  are\r\n\r\ncollecting  all  that  we should  from  non-resident\r\n\r\nindividuals who are taking money from this  country\r\n\r\nand putting nothing back into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the imposition of the tax on the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  cars as far as  a  small  car  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  does  not  have  our  support.  If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had taken active and energetic steps  to\r\n\r\nre-organise   the  public  transport   system   for\r\n\r\nefficient islandwide services, such a tax could be\r\n\r\nunderstood. But the only thing that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas done towards carrying out its election promises\r\n\r\nis to set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  a Bus Licensing Authority which spends its time\r\n\r\nturning  down  bus routes and thus encouraging  the\r\n\r\npirate taxi or expecting people to walk. I have  no\r\n\r\nobjection  to  the expensive car  being  taxed  and\r\n\r\ntaxed  even  more  heavily than is proposed.  There\r\n\r\nseems  to  be no justification for large limousines\r\n\r\nwhich  take  up far too much space on  our  crowded\r\n\r\nroads  and  in the public car parks, and which  are\r\n\r\nnot  really necessary for getting about from  place\r\n\r\nto place in the limited mileage of this island, but\r\n\r\nI   have   every  objection  to  putting  a   small\r\n\r\ninexpensive car even a dollar further  out  of  the\r\n\r\nreach of a man who wants to buy it. Such a car  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  necessary precaution for the family  man\r\n\r\nwhen the public transport system is inefficient and\r\n\r\nwhen  it  breaks down through strikes  unexpectedly\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three  times a year. It is  not  merely  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  getting oneself to work but of  getting\r\n\r\none's  children to school and a small cheap car  is\r\n\r\nthe  most economical way of doing this. This  would\r\n\r\nalso  help  the taxi-driver of whom the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill made mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am well aware that the retort from\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Members opposite will be that you  cannot\r\n\r\nhave social services unless you pay for them and to\r\n\r\npay   for  them,  you  must  get  more  money  from\r\n\r\ntaxation. But you can also get the money  you  want\r\n\r\nby  economies in expenditure and by more efficiency\r\n\r\nin  the  collection of revenue and I would like  in\r\n\r\nthis respect to make a few practical suggestions. I\r\n\r\nhave  already  referred  to  the  failure  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to combat tax evasion and I now refer to\r\n\r\nwhat I can only call the scandal of the failure  of\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Office  to collect rents  on  Government\r\n\r\nproperties and of the failure of the Rural Board to\r\n\r\ncollect  rates. With your permission, Sir,  let  me\r\n\r\nquote from the Report of the Director of Audit  for\r\n\r\nthe year 1955, paragraph 22 (iii) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Class IV: Rents on Government Property.- Arrears\r\n\r\nof  Quit  Rents  amounted  to  $116,174  at  31st\r\n\r\nDecember,   1955,  and  arrears  of   Rents   for\r\n\r\nReverted  Houses to $104,623. Both these  amounts\r\n\r\nare  somewhat greater than the amounts at the end\r\n\r\nof the previous year...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  it  might be thought that these  are  arrears\r\n\r\nwhich can be collected in due\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse  but I beg to doubt it. Paragraph 20 on  the\r\n\r\nsame subject reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...None of the control accounts could be balanced\r\n\r\nat   31st  December,  1955,  and  a  recent   audit\r\n\r\nexamination of the records was abandoned  owing  to\r\n\r\ndifficulty in tracing the entries...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Turning  to  paragraph 22 (v)  headed  \"Rural  Board\r\n\r\nRevenue\", we read this cryptic entry:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As in previous years no return has been rendered\r\n\r\nto  show the arrears of rates which are known to be\r\n\r\nconsiderable...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Here  is obviously a considerable loss in the Rural\r\n\r\nBoard   revenue  and  an  unknown  loss  which   by\r\n\r\nimplication  amounts to hundreds  of  thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars.  Had the revenue been properly  collected,\r\n\r\nthe  Government would have been able to reduce  the\r\n\r\ngrant to the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as extravagance is concerned, Sir, I will\r\n\r\ncontent myself with a few major items. The first is\r\n\r\nthe Paya Lebar Terminal Building which is estimated\r\n\r\nto  cost no less than $7,150,000. Now while I agree\r\n\r\nthat   a  first-class  building  is  necessary   if\r\n\r\nSingapore  is to develop as a great air centre  and\r\n\r\nwhile I agree that the present Terminal Building is\r\n\r\nnot ideal, this does seem to me planning on far too\r\n\r\ngrandiose a scale. I believe that the plans include\r\n\r\nthe building of a hotel. Why spend public money and\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D.'s  time  on  a project  that  could  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  private  enterprise,  and  is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  any case, so sure  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  remain a night-stopping place with the faster\r\n\r\nair  services of the future? It seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nthis  figure  of over $7 million needs considerable\r\n\r\nexplanation and examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another large item is for the new District\r\n\r\nHospital  regarding  which we  fail  to  understand\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy.  Last year,  we  queried  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  $3,200,000 for this hospital.  We  were\r\n\r\nassured that there was no extravagance. This  year,\r\n\r\nwe  are  asked to approve the figure of  $6,500,000\r\n\r\nfor   the  same  hospital.  Quite  apart  from  the\r\n\r\ndoubling of the estimate, the Ministry has  delayed\r\n\r\na  year  in  under-taking this project.  Prices  of\r\n\r\nsteel and other building materials have now gone up\r\n\r\nby  15  to  20 per cent and the delay has cost  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer hundreds of thousands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  dollars. Why has the figure of $3,200,000 which\r\n\r\nwas adequate a year ago become inadequate today? If\r\n\r\nyou  must  spend  $6\u00bd million, why  not  build  two\r\n\r\nhospitals in two places and serve more people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third large item, Sir, is $5 million to be\r\n\r\nspent  on new Government Offices. What is  it  all\r\n\r\nfor?  Does this not imply another vast increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost of administration? We are being asked  to\r\n\r\napprove  the commencement of work on three projects\r\n\r\namounting  to  nearly $20 million.  Unless  we  are\r\n\r\ngiven satisfactory explanations regarding the  need\r\n\r\nfor  this  expenditure and the manner in which  the\r\n\r\nestimates were made, we have every right not merely\r\n\r\nto  vote  against these items individually  but  to\r\n\r\nvote against this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now turn to another aspect of Government\r\n\r\npolicy. Millions of dollars are to be spent on  our\r\n\r\neducation  and  health services. We do  not  grudge\r\n\r\nthis if the money is spent carefully and wisely and\r\n\r\nevery  dollar  is accounted for, but much  of  this\r\n\r\nmoney   will  nevertheless  be  wasted  if,  having\r\n\r\nproduced  well-educated and  healthy  citizens,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  provide  them with employment.  Money  must\r\n\r\nalso  be provided for productive purposes. While  I\r\n\r\nam  glad to see that extra money is being given  to\r\n\r\nour  veterinary  services  to  expand,  which  will\r\n\r\nassist  in the development of local pig and poultry\r\n\r\nindustries, I deplore the fact that there is little\r\n\r\nmoney  being allotted to fisheries. The  Government\r\n\r\nspends  less than $700,000 a year on the Department\r\n\r\nof Fisheries and no fund whatever has been allotted\r\n\r\nin the Development Estimates to this most important\r\n\r\nindustry. I shall have more to say on this  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish now to refer to the progress to be made in\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of our new Singapore  Battalion.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) told  this\r\n\r\nHouse last April when he was still Chief Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is now a concerted effort being made to\r\n\r\nproduce  an operational battalion by April 1957.  I\r\n\r\nam told that it can be done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  regret  to say, Sir, that, at that time,  I  was\r\n\r\nsceptical as to whether it could be done but now  I\r\n\r\nam sceptical as to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether the Government intends to do it even by the\r\n\r\nend  of 1957. The only items of expenditure on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Battalion as I can find in the  Estimate\r\n\r\nare $1 million for pay and allowance, 1 million for\r\n\r\nequipment and $\u00bd million for administration. I do\r\n\r\nnot believe that you can equip and train an officer\r\n\r\nand  pay a battalion of 800 men on $2 million and  I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to  know  what  the  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  in this matter. What is  absolutely\r\n\r\nclear is that there has been no concerted effort and\r\n\r\nthat  there has been a change in policy  since  the\r\n\r\nMarshall  Government was in power. In any case,  it\r\n\r\nis  clear  from the recent riots, and as I  pointed\r\n\r\nout in this House last April, that on battalion  is\r\n\r\nnot enough if we are to look after our own internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point: I have searched the Estimates in\r\n\r\nvain  for  details  of the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\naccount  in  which sums amounting to  millions  per\r\n\r\nmonth  must be accumulated. How are these  millions\r\n\r\ninvested? What returns are being obtained on  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  and to what use are they being  put  to\r\n\r\nimprove our financial position? I hope the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary will explain how these  funds\r\n\r\nare invested and the Government's intentions for the\r\n\r\nutilisation of these funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I must return to the Government's\r\n\r\ntaxation policy. It is an old axiom but a very true\r\n\r\none  that it is better to sell two articles  at  75\r\n\r\ncents each than one article at a dollar. It is  all\r\n\r\nthe  more  true  of the small close  community  of\r\n\r\ntraders  which comprises this island of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  live  or  die by trade: not only  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade with our neighbours, but also the trade which\r\n\r\nwe  practise  on ourselves. If we are to  live  and\r\n\r\nprosper,  we  must not forget that axiom.  We  must\r\n\r\nincrease  the  purchasing power of the  people;  we\r\n\r\nmust sell more goods more cheaply. The greater  the\r\n\r\nflow  of trade, not only the more revenue will flow\r\n\r\ninto the Government coffers but the higher will  be\r\n\r\nthe  general standard of living and the less  money\r\n\r\nwill  be used for social services because the lower\r\n\r\nincome groups will be able, to some extent, to look\r\n\r\nafter themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am prepared to agree that income tax\r\n\r\ncould  be raised still further than is contemplated\r\n\r\non   the  highest  income  brackets  without  undue\r\n\r\nhardship  to  the  individual,  nevertheless,   the\r\n\r\nproper principle is not so much to attempt to bring\r\n\r\nthe  rich man down to the level of the poor man  as\r\n\r\nto  raise the income and standard of living of  the\r\n\r\npoor closer to that of the rich.

I wish to inform this House that it\r\n\r\nis  high time for us to realise that, if we want to\r\n\r\nfight  for  political independence,  we  must  also\r\n\r\nfight  for  ideological independence. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nsupport  the Member for Queenstown in pressing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider the possibility of  amending\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax  Ordinance so  that  the  personal\r\n\r\nrelief allowance must include the parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, up to now we have heard a number of speeches\r\n\r\ndelivered by both sides. It is not surprising  that\r\n\r\none  side  attacks the Government Budget  as  being\r\n\r\ncolonial, imaginative or impractical. Sir, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  no  Member on the Government side has  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  it  is ideally socialistic in  that  the\r\n\r\nallocation of expenditure for the main services  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  namely,  Education  and  Health,  will\r\n\r\namount to 40 per cent of the total revenue. I think\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  point  that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\nto  take  such steps for a Socialist State as  they\r\n\r\nhave  promised us. But, unfortunately, many of  our\r\n\r\nMembers feel that they must play at party politics,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a bad habit in this House, and therefore\r\n\r\nwhen  they say something, they always remember that\r\n\r\nthey  belong to such and such a Party and that they\r\n\r\nmust  stand  for  the Party and  that  stand  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  stand. Therefore, in this debate,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that we, and by \"we\" I include the Strangers'\r\n\r\nGallery, are not surprised at so much rubbish being\r\n\r\ntalked about. Some Members boast and say, \"That  is\r\n\r\nmy Party stand. I am the man with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical stand and that is my stand.\" Sir, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  high time that this is checked.  The  issue\r\n\r\nthat  is  facing us in this House  is  not  one  of\r\n\r\nsocialist, capitalist or progressive ideas  but  an\r\n\r\nindependent movement, and unity of strength must be\r\n\r\nshown.  So  why  waste our time and  our  lungs  on\r\n\r\nreflecting whether or not to believe that charge by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)\r\n\r\nthat this is a colonial Budget? It is true that  on\r\n\r\nour  memorandum  letterheads, you can  see  printed\r\n\r\n\"Colony  of Singapore\". We are still the Colony  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. So why do we not face the fact  that  we\r\n\r\nare  now  in the transitional period from a  colony\r\n\r\nmoving towards an independent State? Therefore when\r\n\r\nwe  study the Budget and go through a debate on it,\r\n\r\nwe  must  face  the fact that we are not  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith our colony status and that we are now fighting\r\n\r\ntowards  an independent State. That Budget produced\r\n\r\nby  the  elected Ministers under colonial influence\r\n\r\ncan  provide 40 per cent of the revenue for welfare\r\n\r\nservices is, I think, unreasonable; especially when\r\n\r\nwe  compare the draft estimates of expenditure  for 1957 and 1956 - the $254 million for 1957 as compared\r\n\r\nwith  the $231 million for 1956 - and find that there\r\n\r\nis  an  increase  of  $23 million.  From  this  $23\r\n\r\nmillion, we find $11 million has been provided  for\r\n\r\nthe  improvement of the education system  and  $2.7\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the  improvement of the  medical  and\r\n\r\nhealth  services. So, based on this figure, if  one\r\n\r\nwants  to  demand more schools, more hospital  beds\r\n\r\nand  a  joyride over the Merdeka Bridge, is it  any\r\n\r\nwonder  that  one  might find the  Bridge  suddenly\r\n\r\nrising  over the Kallang River? To have  all  these\r\n\r\nthings, you have to have solid money. What we  must\r\n\r\nconsider    is    that   we   are   the    people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and that we should  give  a  clear\r\n\r\npicture   of  the  current  state  of  affairs   in\r\n\r\nSingapore to our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fact that multi-lingualism has\r\n\r\nnot yet been introduced into this House, I wish  to\r\n\r\nquote  an  old Chinese saying, and a few  Ministers\r\n\r\nmay  understand  it. It is a very  simple  economic\r\n\r\ntheory  that  has  existed for  many  thousands  of\r\n\r\nyears.  The  saying is Chi liu kai kung.  It  means\r\n\r\nthat we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  try  to  open  up more streams  so  that  the\r\n\r\noutflow of water can be restricted. In other words,\r\n\r\nwe must make more money and spend less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when faced with increases for social\r\n\r\nservices,   Government  usually   says,   \"Increase\r\n\r\ntaxation.\"   Unfortunately,   the   Labour    Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government will make a great mistake  if\r\n\r\nthey  reduce the personal allowance from $3,000  to\r\n\r\n$2,500  because  it  will affect the  contributions\r\n\r\nwhich  people can really afford making towards  the\r\n\r\nrevenue   of   this  country.  I   am   sure   that\r\n\r\nGovernment's  failure to increase company  tax  was\r\n\r\nmerely  based on the statement of certain  business\r\n\r\nand financial experts who say, \"If you increase the\r\n\r\ncompany  tax,  you  will  stop  attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  or local investment.\" Sir, I am sure  that\r\n\r\nis wrong. A few days back I had a chance to talk to\r\n\r\nthe  only banker who is a nominated Member in  this\r\n\r\nHouse (Mr Sutherland). I asked him to confirm  how\r\n\r\nmuch  local  capital surplus is available  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. He gave me an estimate - not official - of at\r\n\r\nleast $100 million which is lying idle in the local\r\n\r\nbanks  of  Singapore and the Federation. I  said  I\r\n\r\nwondered why the Government could not find ways and\r\n\r\nmeans  of  encouraging all this  local  capital  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  this country and the answer  from  this\r\n\r\nbanker which surprised me was, \"No, unless you  can\r\n\r\nchange  the  people's minds. Even Government  bonds\r\n\r\nhave had a weak response.\" So I think the Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  bear  in  mind the fact  that  we  have  no\r\n\r\nshortage of local capital and that there is no need\r\n\r\nfor us to try to induce foreign investments. We can\r\n\r\nafford to stand on our own and the only thing  that\r\n\r\nwe  should do is to bring our economy in line  with\r\n\r\npolitical  stability. You can secure  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical stability even if the company tax goes up\r\n\r\nto 50 per cent. Maybe I am wrong but I do not think\r\n\r\nso,  judging  from  how  the  Ford  Motor  Company,\r\n\r\ndespite  the heavy taxation in the United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\ninsisted  on  opening  their branch  and  factories\r\n\r\nthere, and how the Austin Motor Works also tried to\r\n\r\nopen  a  factory  or offices in the  United  States\r\n\r\ndespite the heavy company tax in that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular  country.  Therefore,  based   on   this\r\n\r\ntheory, I think that the elected Government  should\r\n\r\nnot be misled into thinking that, by increasing the\r\n\r\ncompany tax, we would merely stop local investment.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not true. The reason why the market  is  so\r\n\r\ndull  and  investors are scared is not due  to  the\r\n\r\nhigh  company tax but because of our political  and\r\n\r\neconomic   instability.  Therefore  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould   go  all  out  to  increase  our   national\r\n\r\nenterprises  and engage in the development  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I wonder why we cannot develop our\r\n\r\nfishing industry. I met an economic expert  from  a\r\n\r\nforeign country and he said he wondered why such an\r\n\r\nisland  like Singapore is still importing fish.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  it  was a terrible mistake for the Government\r\n\r\nnot  to train the fishing industry in the best  and\r\n\r\nmost ideal methods. I wish to point this out to the\r\n\r\nelected Government, that we must not only think  of\r\n\r\ngetting more money from taxation directly,  but  we\r\n\r\nmust  also think of indirectly promoting trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce by encouraging our national enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to speak on the means of economising\r\n\r\non   expenditure.  We  can  try  to  cut  down   on\r\n\r\nunnecessary   expenditure,   for   example   family\r\n\r\nplanning   and   certain  donations   to   imperial\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  and  we must take  note  of  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant   point:   that   every   year   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments  are increasing. Look at  the  following\r\n\r\nfigures.   This   year  personal  emoluments   have\r\n\r\nincreased  by $15 million. The figure for  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments for 1956 was $98 million, and  for  1957\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  spend about $113 million. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthis  is due to the yearly increments, but I  think\r\n\r\nwe  can  still  have the opportunity  of  examining\r\n\r\nwhether there is any surplus service which  is  not\r\n\r\nrequired in any department and try to save as  much\r\n\r\nas we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While touching on development projects for health\r\n\r\nand  education, I wish to point out to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  that  we  require more  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nclinics,  but  we  do  not require  such  luxurious\r\n\r\nhospitals as the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. It is too\r\n\r\nexpensive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  we  poor Singaporeans to enjoy. We  want  more\r\n\r\nhospital  beds  and we want more clinics  scattered\r\n\r\naround the rural areas, but definitely we must  not\r\n\r\nbe  too  taken  up  with our  luxuries  by  wanting\r\n\r\neverything  first-class  in  the  world - first-class\r\n\r\nhospitals, X-ray equipment, and everything of  the\r\n\r\nbest. Our wants must be based on our pocket and our\r\n\r\nnational  revenue.  We  do not  have  rich  natural\r\n\r\nresources like other countries. We have to rely  on\r\n\r\ntrade  and  commerce. A businessman's  income - I  am\r\n\r\nsure many Members will know - is always uncertain.  I\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to  say  that  in  drafting\r\n\r\nBudgets  in  the future any expenditure  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  from  the most economic  and  practical\r\n\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spend many, many millions of dollars for\r\n\r\nfurther development of schools, but I want to point\r\n\r\nout  that  we want more schools rather  than  multi-storeyed  schools,  and to  spend  at  least  about\r\n\r\n$200,000  to  build a school. We face a politically\r\n\r\ncritical   situation   now.  The   improvement   of\r\n\r\neducation is very essential, especially the Chinese\r\n\r\neducation system. We have to spend a lot  of  money\r\n\r\non  the  development of education. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education can give me an answer as\r\n\r\nto  how many of the proposed schools to be built in\r\n\r\nthe  coming year are going to be Chinese or  Malay.\r\n\r\nIf  the policy is based on the old system that  all\r\n\r\nschools  envisaged  to  be built  will  be  English\r\n\r\nschools, then I am sure it will lack the support of\r\n\r\nall  circles.  Sir,  I want to point  out  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  try  to  build  more schools  economically,\r\n\r\nscattered  around the rural areas. I  have  visited\r\n\r\none  which  was built by the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck) and I have  been  given  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  one class-room costing roughly  $3,000.\r\n\r\nThis school is called the Tai Teow School and it is\r\n\r\nlocated in Lorong Tai Seng. To my taste, it is most\r\n\r\nsuitable  as  a primary school for the rural  areas\r\n\r\nwhich are in much need of such schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government can take the advice of the\r\n\r\nold  Chinese  saying to open up  more  streams  and\r\n\r\nthereby restrict\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe outflow of water, then I am sure everybody will\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Member started  off  with  the\r\n\r\ncontention   that  actual  experience   has   shown\r\n\r\ninvariably that surpluses occur in tax collections.\r\n\r\nMay  I point out to him, Sir, that if he refers  to\r\n\r\nthe  figures  of the 1956 Estimates, he  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  the  income tax collection estimate for  1956\r\n\r\nwas $65 million but the revised estimate is now $60\r\n\r\nmillion? There is already a deficit of $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Inefficiency!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Sir, he wants the Government  to\r\n\r\ncut  its  financial  Estimates extremely  fine.  He\r\n\r\nwants us to go to a dangerous level. He wants us to\r\n\r\nshow  exactly how much we will be able to spend  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming year and not to increase taxes  because\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  that  we  will  be  able  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nincreased   expenditure  resulting  from  increased\r\n\r\nsocial  services which we are pledged to carry  out\r\n\r\nas a Socialist Government. But, Sir, may I draw his\r\n\r\nattention  to the fact that, even after  all  these\r\n\r\nincreased  taxes as proposed by my hon. Friend  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary, they will only rope in another\r\n\r\n$20  million, leaving still a deficit of about  $17\r\n\r\nmillion; and that the margin of $17 million should\r\n\r\nprobably  be  covered  by increased  collection  in\r\n\r\ntaxes  over  what is anticipated, and by  a  lesser\r\n\r\namount being spent under various Heads, though they\r\n\r\nneed not necessarily be savings but they can always\r\n\r\nbe  votes that are not expended this year and which\r\n\r\nhave  to he revoted next year? But that $17 million\r\n\r\nis   a  margin  for  that  purpose,  otherwise  the\r\n\r\ntaxation proposals could have been more drastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to plead for the\r\n\r\npoor  workers who will be affected by the  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  price  of cigarettes due to the  increased\r\n\r\nduty  on  cigarettes, and so on. But he  failed  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  point that if the poor people could  not\r\n\r\nafford  the  extra  five  cents  on  a  packet   of\r\n\r\ncigarettes, they could switch on to smoking locally-made   cigarettes  on  which  the  Government   now\r\n\r\nproposes that the tax should not be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan (Kampong Kapor):</b> Change of cigarettes will affect the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

But the worker has\r\n\r\nthe chance of smoking cheaper cigarettes now if  he\r\n\r\ngoes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand smokes locally-manufactured cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member went on to say that the\r\n\r\nGovernment changes its plans very often - I think  he\r\n\r\nwas  referring to the District Hospital  which  was\r\n\r\nproposed to be built at Kallang and which is now to\r\n\r\nbe  built at Tanah Merah. The hon. Member would, of\r\n\r\ncourse, prefer that the Government should stick  by\r\n\r\nwhat it has said even if it realises that a mistake\r\n\r\nhas  been  made. Does he prefer that the Government\r\n\r\nact that way? But he might come round and then tell\r\n\r\nGovernment, \"You made a mistake. You realised  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a mistake. Why did you not change  your\r\n\r\nplan?\" Of course, he would change according to  the\r\n\r\nscene at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on with a lot of talk about the high\r\n\r\nrents that the S.I.T. charges the poor dwellers who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford them. I, Sir, was one who had always\r\n\r\nbeen  against  these high rents of the  S.I.T. but\r\n\r\nthen  whom  did I come up against, Sir? I  came  up\r\n\r\nagainst  Members  of his Party in  the  S.I.T. who\r\n\r\njustified  these high rents and when  I asked  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. authorities, \"Why do you charge $400 or $450\r\n\r\nfor  a  shop?\", they answered, \"We have  to  get  a\r\n\r\nprofit  out of the shops in order to subsidise  the\r\n\r\ndwelling houses.\" That is the excuse they  gave  to\r\n\r\nme. But I suggest, Sir, that he can more profitably\r\n\r\ntalk  with certain Members of his Party who are  on\r\n\r\nthe Board of the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Government controls it.

We have, Sir, raised this matter\r\n\r\nvery  often with the Federation Government  but  so\r\n\r\nfar there has been no agreement reached and I think\r\n\r\nthat  I warned this House a month or two back  that\r\n\r\neconomics   in  the  present-day  world   in   many\r\n\r\ncountries  are dictated by politics. They  are  not\r\n\r\npurely dictated by economic reasoning but they  are\r\n\r\ndictated by political reasoning and therefore, Sir,\r\n\r\nI think that the solution is not one of an economic\r\n\r\napproach but rather of a political approach. If  we\r\n\r\ncan  once get the political situation clarified and\r\n\r\nsettled, we might find that this difficulty will be\r\n\r\ndone   away   with.   Sir,  the   Liberal-Socialist\r\n\r\nParty - some  members of which belonged  to  the  Progressive  Party - have not done anything in the  past\r\n\r\nto   help   this  situation  towards  a   political\r\n\r\nsettlement.  In fact, some of them  have  made  the\r\n\r\nsituation worse and I quote, Sir - memories are short\r\n\r\nsometimes   but  sometimes  every  thing   is   not\r\n\r\nforgotten - from  the  Singapore  Standard  of   18th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1951:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\">\"'UNITY' CALL-COLONY INDIGNANT. `WHAT?

My contention is this,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  still  firmly believe that the solution  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic   problem  between  the   Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a political one and not  an  economic\r\n\r\none.  That holds true for many other countries with\r\n\r\nwhom  we  are  doing  trade.  But  I  will  not  be\r\n\r\nsurprised, Sir, that if this sort of tariff barrier\r\n\r\ndoes persist, some of our factories will have to go\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation  and we cannot  help  that;  no\r\n\r\ngovernment in Singapore can help that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member did talk on trade and that the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Government   should   create    stable\r\n\r\nconditions  and a sense of security.  Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing all that we can to attract foreign capital to\r\n\r\nset  up  industries. I outlined at the last sitting\r\n\r\nof  this  House  the programme that Government  had\r\n\r\nplanned  for  the  expansion and  encouragement  of\r\n\r\nindustries. Beyond that, I think it is  a  question\r\n\r\nof  political  stability as the Member  for  Changi\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim Cher Kheng) has pointed out and as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  at  the last sitting. The events of the  last\r\n\r\nmonth's  riots  and the events that  have  gone  on\r\n\r\nbefore  during the last one and a half  years,  not\r\n\r\nonly the so-called political agitation but also the\r\n\r\nso-called  trade  union agitation  led  by  certain\r\n\r\npeople with political motives, have done great harm\r\n\r\nto Singapore's good name and to the confidence that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  otherwise have  enjoyed  by  many\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the question of the Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotions Board. What will the Government do  with\r\n\r\nthe  $1  million?  How will it be controlled?  What\r\n\r\nwill  be the policy? Will it be flexible or  rigid?\r\n\r\nWhy does not the Government announce the scheme? If\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member has a little bit of patience,  the\r\n\r\nBill  will be coming before the House very shortly.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now in draft form and, with a few finishing\r\n\r\ntouches,  it  should be ready very shortly.  But  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  this, Sir, that it will be  a  statutory\r\n\r\nBoard, and the Board will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  funds  allocated  to  it.  It  will   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for giving out the loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng) who asked, \"Why not\r\n\r\ntell us the real position? Why tell us that you are\r\n\r\nfinancially  sound and yet tax us more  and  more?\"\r\n\r\nSir,  no  matter how far we can produce a Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  who may be a wizard or who  may  have  a\r\n\r\ngift of seeing into the future, no human being  can\r\n\r\ntell  what  the future will exactly  be  like  and,\r\n\r\nnormally,   estimates  are  prepared   on   certain\r\n\r\nbackground  performances and  expectations  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Sir,  you cannot expect any government  or\r\n\r\nany Financial Secretary to do better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown claimed that the House\r\n\r\nwas  told  that we were on the verge of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThat  is  not so, Sir. At no stage was  this  House\r\n\r\ntold  that  we were on the verge of bankruptcy.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Hon. the Financial Secretary  gave  an\r\n\r\nassurance in his speech that the financial position\r\n\r\nwas sound. There is no question of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a long lament on giving grants to\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations.  Sir,  some   of   these\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations do a lot of good  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  and save Government a lot of money  by  the\r\n\r\namount  of relief work that they do which otherwise\r\n\r\nwould  fall on the shoulders of Government and  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer because of direct grants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to the tax on petrol and the\r\n\r\nincreased  registration fee for cars. He said  that\r\n\r\nif  a  worker travelled by taxi, it would  be  very\r\n\r\nexpensive and that he would have to pay about $8 on\r\n\r\ntaxi  fares.  Have hon. Members ever heard  of  any\r\n\r\ncountry in which a worker travels by taxi? I do not\r\n\r\nknow what the definition of \"worker\" is now in  the\r\n\r\nminds   of  the  Opposition  Members  but,  as   is\r\n\r\nrecognised even in this Colony, our Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nOrdinance  provides a limit of $200 a month  income\r\n\r\nbeyond  which  a  worker is made to contribute.  It\r\n\r\nrecognises the fact then that with an income of  up\r\n\r\nto  $200 a month a man is supposed to come into the\r\n\r\nvery low income group. The S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso - on which the Liberal-Socialist Party had a lot\r\n\r\nto  say - put  a  limit of $200 for the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup  to qualify for the very cheap rental houses.\r\n\r\nSir,  it is generally recognised that a person with\r\n\r\nan income of up to $200 a month is taken as one who\r\n\r\nis  in  a  low income group. Beyond that, it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) said\r\n\r\nthat we should develop fisheries. We are doing  so,\r\n\r\nSir,  but  to develop fisheries, it does take  time\r\n\r\nand  it  is not as easy as just casting a  net  and\r\n\r\ngetting  a ton of fish out of the water.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nphased  programme which takes a number of years  to\r\n\r\nproduce  results.  We  have  the  Fishery  Research\r\n\r\nStation here which is not only for Singapore but is\r\n\r\na regional Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Where are the results?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I will come to that. That\r\n\r\nstation,   Sir,  has  a  long-term  programme   for\r\n\r\nresearch  and,  so  far, I think  it  has  been  in\r\n\r\nexistence  for  four years. It has done  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nresearch   but  it  has  not  shown  any  immediate\r\n\r\nresults.  I am now directing my attention  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  station  should change its programme  to  one\r\n\r\nthat  will  show a more immediate result  and  that\r\n\r\nmatter  is receiving attention but beyond that  the\r\n\r\ngranting of three licences for joint fisheries with\r\n\r\nthe Japanese should bring in more fish. I think the\r\n\r\nJapanese  fishing-boats will be coming in in December\r\n\r\nunder those three licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, after all the lament by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) over driving licence\r\n\r\nfees,  and so on, I think he has not taken heed  of\r\n\r\nwhat  happened  in  the City Council  at  the  last\r\n\r\nBudget meeting. The leader of the Liberal-Socialist\r\n\r\nParty  at  the  last  Budget meeting  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil declared that there is no poor man and that\r\n\r\neven  a market stall-holder is a capitalist.  Then,\r\n\r\nSir,  in the City Council, they raised the hawkers'\r\n\r\nlicence  fees from $1 per year to $12 at first  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently to $48 per year -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

They are poor men but the hawker  is  not;\r\n\r\nhe is a capitalist and he can afford to pay from $1\r\n\r\nup to $48 a year. That is their logic, not ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the luxury tax, Sir, it is an\r\n\r\nequitable  tax.  It  is a tax  that  any  Socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment would be happy to introduce.  It  is  in\r\n\r\nline  with Socialistic principles. It is a tax that\r\n\r\nwill hit the man who can afford to pay. If a person\r\n\r\nis  rich  and can afford luxuries, let him pay  for\r\n\r\nthem. On the grouses that the Opposition have  made\r\n\r\nnot  to  tax the poor, I do not see why they should\r\n\r\nhave  a grouse on the Luxury Tax Bill because  this\r\n\r\ntax  is  designed and aimed at the rich and not  at\r\n\r\nthe poor. But one deserving argument was raised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tanglin (Mr John  Ede)  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen  that  the  free  port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is not endangered as a result of this tax\r\n\r\nand  I think the Hon. the Financial Secretary  will\r\n\r\nbe  glad  to  assure him that before  any  item  is\r\n\r\nplaced as coming within the orbit of the Luxury Tax\r\n\r\nBill,  we  will examine it very carefully  and  see\r\n\r\nwhat  effects  it will have on the entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nEvery  care will be taken to see that the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  does  not  suffer as a result  of  any  item\r\n\r\ncoming into the Luxury Tax Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is very alarming that our expenditure should go\r\n\r\nup  sky-high year by year. When we look at page  13\r\n\r\nof  the Estimates which shows the expenditure  from\r\n\r\nApril  1946 to 1955, the period between April  1946\r\n\r\nand  1947 was generally the reoccupation period but\r\n\r\nafter  that period, the expenditure rose  from  $74\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1948 to $197 million in 1955  and  the\r\n\r\npresent estimated expenditure for 1957 is shown  as\r\n\r\n$254  million. At this rate, the Colony  is  surely\r\n\r\ndrifting to bankruptcy. I do emphasise that this is\r\n\r\nso  and  the reason is this. This is a small island\r\n\r\nof  about  224  square  miles,  part  of  which  is\r\n\r\noccupied by the Services. It has no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural   resources   of  its   own,   unlike   the\r\n\r\nFederation. The only resource is its entrepot trade\r\n\r\nand  if  the  principle of the  free  trade  policy\r\n\r\nmaintained  up  till  now is jeopardised,  I  think\r\n\r\nSingapore will be nothing but a strategic island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our revenues have been derived so far from\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  tobacco,  alcohol,  petrol  and  through\r\n\r\nincome tax. With the exception of income tax, other\r\n\r\ntaxes  are  going  up  and  up,  which  is  causing\r\n\r\nhardship to all, especially the poor. Now may I ask\r\n\r\nsome  questions,  Sir, and  I  hope  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary  will reply.  Where  does  the\r\n\r\nmoney  from  the  revenue go to? Am  I  correct  in\r\n\r\nsaying  that 55 to 60 per cent of the revenue  goes\r\n\r\ntowards administration costs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, Singapore is a very small\r\n\r\nisland.  In  the  pre-war days,  we  had  one  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Singapore  and  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nToday we have a Governor, the Chief Minister, eight\r\n\r\nMinisters and four Assistant Ministers. Do we  need\r\n\r\nso  many  people  when  this island  was  governed,\r\n\r\nthough   in   the   colonial  way,   by   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries who are still in the administration and\r\n\r\ndrawing  the same salaries? This has added  to  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  the  Colony - their  high  salaries,\r\n\r\nallowances, entertainment allowances,  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSir, when a country is going to achieve its freedom\r\n\r\nthe  people  of the country willingly  should  come\r\n\r\nforward to serve the country and accept service  at\r\n\r\nthe lowest salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> They take what they can get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is not so in every place\r\n\r\nand  as  we are well advanced, we can come  forward\r\n\r\nand  show  our patriotism. Of course, I  must  give\r\n\r\ncredit  to  two or three Members on the  Government\r\n\r\nside  who  had much more income than what they  now\r\n\r\nearn.  There is no doubt about it; they  have  made\r\n\r\nsacrifices. But for what is it after all? They  are\r\n\r\nholding positions of honour and they must serve the\r\n\r\ncountry but if they feel that they cannot sacrifice\r\n\r\ntheir former lucrative jobs then they can carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  with  those  jobs and not accept their  present\r\n\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said before, what is the use of doing\r\n\r\naway  with  expatriates when  you  cannot  get  the\r\n\r\nadministration costs reduced? They have to run  two\r\n\r\nhomes,  educate their children abroad, and  so  on,\r\n\r\nwhich is not so with our local people. I do not say\r\n\r\nthat  they should not live comfortably.  I  do  say\r\n\r\nthat they should and they must have a decent income\r\n\r\nbut  this  must be according to the needs  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and not England or even India  or  Ceylon;\r\n\r\nexpatriates come from many places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Luxury Tax Bill - whatever name you may\r\n\r\ncall it - means more or less a duty on imported goods\r\n\r\nand  it  will  be a departure from the  free  trade\r\n\r\npolicy. I will dwell on this subject when this Bill\r\n\r\ncomes up, possibly tomorrow, for Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the higher the taxation, the more wages will\r\n\r\nhave to be paid and the cost of production will  go\r\n\r\nup.  We have no hinterland to serve. If there is  a\r\n\r\nhinterland, you have to pay duties like  any  other\r\n\r\ncountry; I am not criticising the Federation.  They\r\n\r\nhave their own policies. But what will a factory in\r\n\r\nSingapore do if the cost of its manufactured  goods\r\n\r\nis  put up making them uncompetitive in price  with\r\n\r\nimported  goods? Johore is only 16 miles from  here\r\n\r\nand  you  can set up a factory there. What is  then\r\n\r\nthe remedy for us? The only remedy is to bring down\r\n\r\nthe cost of living, cut down expenditure and expend\r\n\r\nwhat you can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, details on the various Heads will be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  at the Committee stage but I would  like\r\n\r\nto  touch  on  the Department of Broadcasting.  The\r\n\r\nmotion  of Malayanisation moved by me in  1952  was\r\n\r\npassed  and  the Department still remains  full  of\r\n\r\nexpatriates.      I      understand - subject      to\r\n\r\ncorrection - that there is only one local man  acting\r\n\r\nin  an  executive post. That can also be  discussed\r\n\r\nlater. Why should the Department of Broadcasting be\r\n\r\na  Government  department? Why  should  it  not  be\r\n\r\ncommercialised or why should it not be changed to a\r\n\r\ncorporation  and made to run on a profitable  basis\r\n\r\nas it is done in other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries?  The  argument from the Government  side\r\n\r\nhas  been that Government should have some  control\r\n\r\nover  this  department. Of course, any  corporation\r\n\r\ncan be controlled by making a condition: Government\r\n\r\ncan  appoint  a nominee on the Board. This  can  be\r\n\r\neasily done. As far as propaganda is concerned, any\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  power  would  like  to  have   such\r\n\r\nmachinery but at whose cost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no provision has been made for the abolition\r\n\r\nterms  of expatriates. How many millions of dollars\r\n\r\nwill  be required? There is also no provision  made\r\n\r\nfor the nationalisation of transport. I hope it can\r\n\r\nbe  pointed out to me whether a provision has  been\r\n\r\nmade and, if so, how much? We will require at least\r\n\r\nfour  or five battalions and how much provision  is\r\n\r\nmade  for  them? Where is this money to come  from?\r\n\r\nHigher  taxation?  At what rate and  on  what?  The\r\n\r\nmoney is not going to fall down from heaven, is  it\r\n\r\nthe   intention  of  the  Government  to   mortgage\r\n\r\nSingapore  even before merdeka comes?  Certainly  I\r\n\r\nwould not like that to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, remarks have been made about contributions\r\n\r\nto  various  charitable organisations.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nState  without  an official religion  as  has  been\r\n\r\nquoted  today and I will dwell on this  subject  at\r\n\r\nthe Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress has been laid on the import of\r\n\r\nforeign  capital. If a man pays a dollar per  share\r\n\r\nas  investment he takes away 15 to 200 per cent  in\r\n\r\ndividends yet that $1 still remains even  after  he\r\n\r\nhas, benefited so much!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, alcohol can easily be taxed more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I will personally be affected, I have\r\n\r\nno  objection  to  a little higher  companies  tax.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong in that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone said that the Labour Front is a Socialist\r\n\r\nParty.  I  hope  the Labour Front  understands  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of Socialism. If they understand,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthey  practise  it.  I was told  that  some  peopie\r\n\r\nshould    only   smoke   locally-made   cigarettes.\r\n\r\nSocialism mean that everyone should have  an  equal\r\n\r\nchance to enjoy everything created in this world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  not  to have two different levels in life  for\r\n\r\npoor  and rich people but here I see that with  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front, Socialism is something different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would suggest to the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe   Financial  Secretary,  whose  task  is   very\r\n\r\ndifficult,  to  try and reduce expenditure  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  items and that if he does so,  there  will\r\n\r\nnot  be a deficit but possibly a surplus and  there\r\n\r\nmay be no need for higher taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, it is rather a\r\n\r\nthin House and I do not propose to take up too much\r\n\r\ntime,  but  there are a few points I think  I  must\r\n\r\nmake. I want to deal with certain matters of policy\r\n\r\nin  my Ministry but I think I ought to deal, first,\r\n\r\nwith  a certain economic aspect of the whole Budget\r\n\r\nand  the  whole Singapore situation. We  have  been\r\n\r\nhaving  a  lot  of very interesting comments  about\r\n\r\ndetails in the Estimates: whether you make a  grant\r\n\r\nto  the  Automobile Association, and so  on - I  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  word about that - but what we have  not  had\r\n\r\nreally,   as  I  can  see,  is  anybody  from   the\r\n\r\nOpposition attempting to give an overall picture of\r\n\r\nthe future economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary did quote\r\n\r\nfrom Sir Sydney Caine's memorandum some very useful\r\n\r\npoints  which  have  not been  touched  on  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition and, on the contrary, the general  theme\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition may be summarised in the remarks\r\n\r\nof  the leader of the Liberal-Socialist Party  who,\r\n\r\napart  from saying that the Government was creating\r\n\r\nan  impression that taxation was necessary and then\r\n\r\nsaying   that  there  was  no  need  for  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation,  finally said that all  additional  taxes\r\n\r\nwere  unnecessary  and that the  Government  should\r\n\r\ndrop  each  and every one of them. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) said  the  same,  I\r\n\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I stand up with some timidity, but unashamed,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  as  an advocate of  higher  taxation\r\n\r\nbecause  this  country of Singapore must  get  more\r\n\r\ncapital  investment.  We need therefore  to  create\r\n\r\nsavings  and form capital on a national scale.  The\r\n\r\nneed arises from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact that in Singapore one and one do not make two,\r\n\r\nbut  one and one make 3.9, that is, if one and  one\r\n\r\nare a man and a woman, the average household is 3.9\r\n\r\npeople, if  you  like  to transform  that  into  a\r\n\r\ndemographic projection, it means that you  have  an\r\n\r\nannual increase of four per cent in your population\r\n\r\nand  that  this  is perhaps the highest  population\r\n\r\nincrease  in the world. It beats Puerto Rico.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  population  is  an  increase  in\r\n\r\ndependants  rather than an increase  in  productive\r\n\r\nworkers.  You  can take a look at the  1955  Annual\r\n\r\nReport  which  gives  you a nice  tabulated  figure\r\n\r\ndiagram   showing  the  population   structure   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  its  enormous  mass  of   infants,\r\n\r\ntapering up to the workers and at the very top, the\r\n\r\nold.  By  a little simple arithmetic and guesswork,\r\n\r\nyou  can  project  that forward,  without  being  a\r\n\r\nmathematician, into a reasonable guess as  to  what\r\n\r\nthe  future population will be. We may have another\r\n\r\nquarter of a million people on this island  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years but of that quarter of a  million,\r\n\r\nonly  50,000 or 60,000 will be an addition  to  the\r\n\r\nworking  force  and the rest - about 200,000  or  so,\r\n\r\ngive or take a few thousands - will be an addition to\r\n\r\nthe  dependants,  the children and  the  aged.  The\r\n\r\neffect  of  that - if you like to  break  it  down - is\r\n\r\nroughly that one worker in Singapore has to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the needs not only of himself but also of  two\r\n\r\ndependants; and as the population goes  five,  ten,\r\n\r\nfifteen, twenty years forward, that situation  will\r\n\r\ngo  on  and the number of dependants will  increase\r\n\r\nrelatively  to  the  number  of  workers.  In   the\r\n\r\nlifetime  of  this Assembly - some  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and not the body as a whole - we  may  have\r\n\r\nthree million persons trying to live on this island\r\n\r\nand that will be very largely a consuming and not a\r\n\r\nproducing population. If you increase the number of\r\n\r\npeople  who  are eating out of the rice  bowl,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  then the amount that each one  gets  will\r\n\r\ndecrease. The only answer to this increasing number\r\n\r\nof  dependants in this increasing population is  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  rice  bowl bigger; in  other  words,  to\r\n\r\nincrease  our  total national production,  and  you\r\n\r\ncannot  increase total national production  without\r\n\r\ninvesting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapital  in  the  equipment  which  you  need   for\r\n\r\nproduction. If we go on as we are, we are condemned\r\n\r\nto  a  fall in the standard of living and no  pious\r\n\r\nhopes  and  no suggestion that we do  not  tax  the\r\n\r\ndrivers  of  motor  cars  are  going  to  make  any\r\n\r\ndifference to that. There will not be enough to  go\r\n\r\nround unless we invest very considerably. If we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to improve the standard of living,  we  must\r\n\r\ninvest  at  a  still higher rate, for  productivity\r\n\r\ndepends  partly on equipment and partly  on  skill,\r\n\r\nand  both  these are matters in which you  have  to\r\n\r\nhave  investment  on a national scale  if  you  are\r\n\r\ngoing to meet national needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this idea of investment in mind, the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  put  in, as the first item in its  four-year\r\n\r\nprogramme, a detailed survey of the national wealth\r\n\r\nin  order that planning could go forward. I am  not\r\n\r\nproposing, Mr Speaker, to take up the time of this\r\n\r\nHouse  with  a  lot of arguments  about  the  gross\r\n\r\nnational  product,  the net  national  income,  the\r\n\r\nratio  of investment to production, and the  annual\r\n\r\nnet  capital  formation, but we can,  I  think,  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the simple statement that  we  have\r\n\r\ngot to have a very large investment and that it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be very difficult to get enough capital to\r\n\r\ninvest.  I hope it will not be too long before  far\r\n\r\nmore  competent persons than myself in the economic\r\n\r\nadvisory  unit do produce something  which  can  be\r\n\r\nmade public so that the brains of this Assembly can\r\n\r\nreally  study  this  problem of getting  sufficient\r\n\r\ncapital  investment over the next few years.  I  am\r\n\r\ncontent, Sir, to say that we must invest and I have\r\n\r\njust  remarked  that investment means,  of  course,\r\n\r\n- one   Member   of   this  Assembly   referred   to\r\n\r\n\"investing\"  in  gambling -  in  things  which   are\r\n\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also assess priorities within our\r\n\r\ninvestment  programme  so  as  to  get   the   most\r\n\r\nproductive  use of the capital. Certain  items  are\r\n\r\nobvious.   If   we   are   going   to    keep    up\r\n\r\ntechnologically,   we  must  have   education   and\r\n\r\nschools.  If  we  are going to  have  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nnumber  of  hours of work per worker  in  a  year's\r\n\r\nwork,  we  have to keep the people fit and healthy;\r\n\r\nwe  have to have health services. As housing  is  a\r\n\r\nbasic preventive health measure, we have to provide\r\n\r\nas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfar  as  we can decent standards of housing.  Those\r\n\r\nare not to be thought of as welfare services in the\r\n\r\nsense that you pity people and say, \"Of course,  he\r\n\r\nhas  not got an education.\" They are vital  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic  future of the country. It is very  proper\r\n\r\nand right that they should be regarded as \"welfare\"\r\n\r\nin  the sense that they do provide for welfare  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  charitable needs based  on  pitying\r\n\r\npeople. They are vital because you need the  people\r\n\r\nto  build the country and you have to have  a  fit,\r\n\r\nhealthy, trained and skilled population to meet our\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another field of investment covers the services\r\n\r\nprovided  publicly for communications,  for  trade,\r\n\r\ncommerce  and  industry;  our  sea  port,  airport,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,  postal,  water  supply,  power\r\n\r\nstations,  drainage  and  all  the  rest  of  these\r\n\r\nobvious things. The points I have mentioned so  far\r\n\r\nhave been traditionally left in the field of public\r\n\r\ninvestment. They come out in the Estimates  and  in\r\n\r\nthe Development programme and you can see what they\r\n\r\nare, but they only account for 50 or 60 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  total  capital  investment  in  a  place  like\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Most  of the studies of  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nthing  are  related to other types of  economy  but\r\n\r\ncommerce and industry are traditionally left to the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  of investments. How  far  that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary, I do not know. It appears to  me  to  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  at present that a considerable  area  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy should be left to the private  sector,\r\n\r\nbut  there is already continuous pressure  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly from the Opposition for the Government  to\r\n\r\nstart   interfering  with  commerce  and  industry,\r\n\r\nassisting  them,  subsidising  them,  strengthening\r\n\r\nthem and providing them with funds, and so on,  and\r\n\r\nI  think  that is probably not only a right  policy\r\n\r\nfrom  the socialist point of view but also a  neces\r\n\r\nsary policy from any practical point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if we are going to get this capital for\r\n\r\ninvestment, we have to ask, \"Where?\" We can  either\r\n\r\nget it from our own resources or we can get it from\r\n\r\noverseas.  If we are not going to have heavy  rates\r\n\r\nof taxation, increasingly heavy rates, then we have\r\n\r\ngot  to  go overseas for that money. We can  go  to\r\n\r\nGreat Britain or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  ask, \"Will you give us a  grant?  In\r\n\r\nother  words, give us a handout. We have  no  money\r\n\r\nand we need money. Give us foreign exchange so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  import  the  equipment  we  want  for  our\r\n\r\nfactories or communication centres, or whatever  it\r\n\r\nis.\"  We  may or we may not get the grants we  need\r\n\r\nbut  we shall be competing for them against a great\r\n\r\nmany  other under-developed countries many of which\r\n\r\nmay  well  appear  to be more fruitful  fields  for\r\n\r\ninvestment. It is the same with loans. Whether they\r\n\r\nare  low  interest or whether they bear the  normal\r\n\r\neconomic interest, there again, we can try and  get\r\n\r\nthem  but  we have to compete with a lot  of  other\r\n\r\npeople who are looking for them as well. If  we  go\r\n\r\nto  the  British  Government or go  to  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  and  try to get money out of  them,  there\r\n\r\nwill be a queue of other people and we have to take\r\n\r\nour  place in the queue. We will take what  we  can\r\n\r\nget and when we get it, it may not be a \"no-strings\r\n\r\nattached\" grant or loan. It may well have some sort\r\n\r\nof  strings attached. We can also try to get  money\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas  by raising loans  in  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncommercial  loan market or, of course, we  may  get\r\n\r\nmoney by tempting the investor to come here and set\r\n\r\nup  his  factory and put his personal money or  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  money  into  development  here.  In  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  brevity, I will  not  read  from  the\r\n\r\nremarks of Professor Paish, Professor of Economics,\r\n\r\nLondon  University,  (with  special  reference   to\r\n\r\nBusiness Statistics, I think). Anyhow, he is a  man\r\n\r\nof  some  weight in the economic world.  He  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  going to be exceedingly  hard  for  a\r\n\r\ncountry  like Singapore to get any money  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate investment field, whether by raising a loan\r\n\r\nor  by  getting direct investment, and  he  remarks\r\n\r\nthat the further the country advances towards self-\r\n\r\ngovernment - that  is,  a hitherto  dependent  Colony\r\n\r\nadvances  towards self-government - the  smaller  the\r\n\r\nchances  of  getting  any money  from  the  private\r\n\r\ninvestor. I do not know if we need to take quite so\r\n\r\ndismal  a  view  as  Professor  Paish  takes,   but\r\n\r\ncertainly   we   have  got  to  reckon   that   our\r\n\r\nexpectations of capital from overseas are going to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimited  and it is right, to some extent,  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  desire to limit them because if you  depend\r\n\r\nfor  your  finance on overseas borrowing,  you  are\r\n\r\nmortgaging your country to the people who have lent\r\n\r\nyou  money. It has a colonial aspect, an aspect  of\r\n\r\neconomic subjection which is not very desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, therefore, that it is necessary and\r\n\r\nimportant, if we are going to have merdeka, for  it\r\n\r\nto  be economic as well as political merdeka; if it\r\n\r\nis  going to be fruitful and prosperous, we  should\r\n\r\nraise  our  own  money in Singapore  from  our  own\r\n\r\nresources.  It means devoting more of the  national\r\n\r\nincome  to  investment and less to consumption.  In\r\n\r\nthe  U.S.S.R., I believe that investment  has  been\r\n\r\nrunning  since  1928 at about 25 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\ngross national income. The U.S.A. runs at about  15\r\n\r\nper  cent. Here I would not like to say. I am  told\r\n\r\nthat  it may be 10 or 12 per cent and that  if  our\r\n\r\npopulation can be stabilised, we may be able to get\r\n\r\nby  on  our  present rates of replacing depreciated\r\n\r\ncapital  and  providing new  capital  for  expanded\r\n\r\ndevelopment; but with our population expanding,  we\r\n\r\ncannot hope to provide for them unless we very much\r\n\r\nincrease  or  perhaps double our  present  rate  of\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remark, in passing, that when we come to\r\n\r\nthe  stirring  debate on family planning,  which  I\r\n\r\nexpect  will be an annual feature, I hope that  the\r\n\r\nanti-family planners will take note of  my  remarks\r\n\r\nabout  population and investment  and  will  refute\r\n\r\nthem in order to justify their opposition to family\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to have savings in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nmust get them in one of three ways. You can let the\r\n\r\ncapitalist  make  profits at  the  expense  of  his\r\n\r\nworkers and then, in his own judgment, he puts  the\r\n\r\nprofits  into  new investments where he  thinks  he\r\n\r\nwill  make  further profits. Or the Government  may\r\n\r\ntax  his profits and income and luxury consumption,\r\n\r\nand  the Government may put its tax money into  new\r\n\r\ninvestments. Or the third way is that the  ordinary\r\n\r\nman  may be thrifty and consumes less than he might\r\n\r\nin  order to invest. I cannot see any other way  of\r\n\r\ngetting money from our own resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we say, \"We must tax the rich. Do not tax the\r\n\r\npoor  but tax the rich\", it means nothing. All  you\r\n\r\nmean  is  that  you are using the  rich  as  a  tax\r\n\r\ncollector for you. Instead of paying out the  money\r\n\r\nin  wages to his workers, he accumulates it for you\r\n\r\nand  you take it from him; he remains unpopular and\r\n\r\nthe Government hides behind his back. Well, that is\r\n\r\nfair  enough. In a transitional stage,  that  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary process. You cannot abolish the fact of a\r\n\r\ncapitalist organisation at once. You can  only  tax\r\n\r\nand  gradually  transform  it.  But  you  have   to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  if  you  are  going  to  use   the\r\n\r\ncapitalist to collect your revenue for you and then\r\n\r\nyou  tax him; or if he is organising the profitable\r\n\r\nenterprises   for  you  and  then   this   Assembly\r\n\r\nlegislates itself into a position of having a claim\r\n\r\nto  a large or small part of his profits; then  you\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  leave enough to keep him interested.\r\n\r\nYou can tax him as high as you can provided he does\r\n\r\nnot  say, \"Well, I am not going to bother with this\r\n\r\nwork for you anymore. I am not getting enough pay.\r\n\r\nI  will  pack  up. I will sell the company  and  go\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\" But he will when he does not  think  he\r\n\r\nis getting enough. We do not want to bring industry\r\n\r\nto  a  standstill by an excessive tax  on  profits.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have,  in effect, been doing  since  this\r\n\r\nGovernment came into office is to ensure by  policy\r\n\r\nand  by  legislation that a greater portion of  the\r\n\r\nnational  income is distributed to the  workers  in\r\n\r\nthe form of wages. That is the effect of the Labour\r\n\r\nBill,   and   the   Clerks  and   Shop   Assistants\r\n\r\nlegislation. It is also a general result of the way\r\n\r\nthings  have  been  going. As you  distribute  that\r\n\r\nproportion  of the national income in  wages,  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou increase the amount which will definitely go to\r\n\r\nconsumption  and which will not go  to  investment.\r\n\r\nNow   that  policy  of  distributing  more  of  the\r\n\r\nnational  income was a right and necessary  policy.\r\n\r\nTwo  or three years ago, one person in four of  the\r\n\r\npopulation was living on less than a dollar a  day,\r\n\r\nor  a family of four on less than a hundred dollars\r\n\r\na month. That redistribution of national income was\r\n\r\nnecessary to lift part of the burden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  intolerable poverty which had been  imposed  on\r\n\r\nthat  very large part of the population in the past\r\n\r\nbut    redistribution   through   wages   is   very\r\n\r\ninequitable. Two men work on the same standard  job\r\n\r\nand receive the same standard rate of pay; one is a\r\n\r\nbachelor  and  the  other has  a  household  of  11\r\n\r\npeople. They have the same pay and if you treat  it\r\n\r\nas  a  matter  of contribution to production,  that\r\n\r\nstandard rate of pay is fair enough. If you look at\r\n\r\nit  from  the point of view of necessity, obviously\r\n\r\nthe  man  who has 11 people to provide for  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  get enough, and a bachelor will probably\r\n\r\nhave too much. If we are going to get nearer to  an\r\n\r\nequitable  distribution of the national income,  in\r\n\r\nmy  view,  we have to supplement wage increases  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand by social security schemes and on the\r\n\r\nother hand by improved taxation techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that where a man has a lot of\r\n\r\ndependants, you have to make some provision for him\r\n\r\nso  that  the dependants are looked after. A  great\r\n\r\ndeal  is  said  about the Asians maintaining  their\r\n\r\nparents;  as  far as I know, so do  the  people  in\r\n\r\nEngland whose parents are in need and any person in\r\n\r\nthe world will maintain his parents if they are  in\r\n\r\nneed.  It is perfectly true that in the absence  of\r\n\r\nsocial security, the people in Singapore do have to\r\n\r\ncarry  a  great many more dependants and much  more\r\n\r\nburden  than they would if we could get the  social\r\n\r\nsecurity  structure  in; but where  a  man  has  no\r\n\r\ndependants - I think I am right in saying that  about\r\n\r\nten per cent of the working population in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  no  dependants - and he sends his money  perhaps\r\n\r\noverseas  to  Europe and China, you ought  to  take\r\n\r\nanother look at it. It is all very well if a man is\r\n\r\na  Malayan living here and makes his home here:  by\r\n\r\nall means, let him support his dependants here, but\r\n\r\nif  he  is  just a bird of passage whose  heart  is\r\n\r\nelsewhere, why should he export our wealth  to  his\r\n\r\nmother country? However, that is another issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we do need to construct our taxation\r\n\r\nsystem  so  as  to  bring the real distribution  of\r\n\r\nwealth  nearer to equity and nearer to  sanity.  We\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  got  to accept the principle of differentials\r\n\r\nand  that you cannot equalise all incomes. You will\r\n\r\nnot get the people to do the work unless there is a\r\n\r\nhigher rate of pay for an engineer than for a clerk\r\n\r\nand  if  you  make the rates of pay the  same,  the\r\n\r\npeople will say, \"We are not going to bother to  be\r\n\r\nengineers;   we  may  as  well  be   clerks   since\r\n\r\neverything is easy.\" You have further got to accept\r\n\r\nthat an experienced engineer is worth more than  an\r\n\r\ninexperienced one. The aim is not to extinguish the\r\n\r\ndifferentials  but to make sure that  nobody  falls\r\n\r\nbelow a minimum standard of living. But if you once\r\n\r\naccept  the  principle of differentials in  income,\r\n\r\nyou  have  to  accept  also  that  there  will   be\r\n\r\ndifferentials in the burden of taxation in one  way\r\n\r\nor another. It is only a matter of the distribution\r\n\r\nof  the  national income: how much can each  person\r\n\r\nget  out  of  it - whether you  give  him  a  hundred\r\n\r\ndollars and then tax him ten dollars or whether you\r\n\r\ngive  him  ninety dollars and do not take  any  tax\r\n\r\nfrom  him?  It is really a book entry,  but  if  we\r\n\r\ncannot get the money by voluntary savings, which is\r\n\r\nmore comfortable or less painful, and if it has got\r\n\r\nto  be taken, it must be taken in tax. We must  get\r\n\r\nit somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made these remarks, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause I felt, to a considerable extent, that  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Opposition were  launching  their\r\n\r\nattack  in the wrong direction. They were grumbling\r\n\r\nabout  the fact that it is not easy to say  whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to have a deficit  or  not  on  the\r\n\r\nEstimates because you cannot perhaps clear  a  site\r\n\r\nand therefore you cannot build a large hospital  or\r\n\r\na school - that kind of problem. I think that is fair\r\n\r\nenough  but I think that they would have been  more\r\n\r\nconstructive if they had approached us on the other\r\n\r\naspect,  and  said that we were not spending  money\r\n\r\nfast  enough -  not throwing money  away - because  we\r\n\r\nwere  not  getting enough capital  investment  into\r\n\r\nthis  country in the public sector. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  they can sustain that attack because  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  as  good  a  job  as could  be  done  in  my\r\n\r\njudgment; but at least it would have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen the right line of attack for them to take, and\r\n\r\nnot  to  go  round and say that all  proposals  for\r\n\r\nfurther  taxation  are  nonsensical.  It  shows   a\r\n\r\ncomplete lack of appreciation of the situation. You\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  look ahead if you are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nseriously running a country in this world today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, with relief, I abandon my\r\n\r\nnotes   on  economic  problems,  which  I  am   not\r\n\r\nparticularly fitted to deal with, and will turn  to\r\n\r\nsome  other aspects. Perhaps I might take, firstly,\r\n\r\nthe newspaper report by the well known Mr Tan Lark\r\n\r\nSye.  This is a translation or a summary and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know that it necessarily represents him rightly\r\n\r\nor not; but this is what is given in the summary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Local banks and other savings organisations are\r\n\r\nkeeping  deposits  from local people  totalling  at\r\n\r\nleast  $300 to $500 million, if not $1,000 million.\r\n\r\nBy  investing $1 million in a factory at least  300\r\n\r\npersons   will   have  employment.  Local   capital\r\n\r\ntherefore is sufficient to run hundreds of or  even\r\n\r\none thousand factories. But why don't they invest?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  answer, of course, is that if they have  their\r\n\r\ncapital   in   a   savings  bank   or   a   savings\r\n\r\norganisation, it is invested because that  is  what\r\n\r\nthe  bank exists for. I am sure that Mr Sutherland\r\n\r\ndoes  not  lock up all the dollar holdings  in  his\r\n\r\nbank.  The  whole purpose of a bank is to  canalise\r\n\r\nsavings  and  to  invest them. But the  point  that\r\n\r\nprobably Mr Tan Lark Sye was approaching but could\r\n\r\nnot  grasp is that you have in this country a  very\r\n\r\nlarge volume of hoarding, partly by the people  who\r\n\r\nbuy these gold bangles - I forget which Member of the\r\n\r\nOpposition referred to the difficulty of  the  poor\r\n\r\nworker  who wants to buy a bangle. I should  advise\r\n\r\nhim  not to buy it: I should advise him to  make  a\r\n\r\npost   office  savings  or  some  other   form   of\r\n\r\ninvestment  because  the gold bangle  will  not  be\r\n\r\nproductive of goods and quite possibly it  will  be\r\n\r\nstolen.  If  he  invests his money  and  gets  some\r\n\r\ninterest  on it, he will contribute to the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  country. That is one thing which could  be\r\n\r\ndone  and  I think that what Members of this  House\r\n\r\nwho  can  persuade anybody should do is to get  the\r\n\r\npeople to mobilise their hoardings and put them  to\r\n\r\nwork. Apart from the jewellery and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  sort of thing, there are also people who keep\r\n\r\ndollar notes, and quite large sums locked up  in  a\r\n\r\ntin  box  in a cubicle. These sometimes get  stolen\r\n\r\nand  go back into circulation. From a social  point\r\n\r\nof  view, that is a very good thing but, of course,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  very good for the person hoarding  the\r\n\r\nmoney.  If  the  people  would  get  their  hoarded\r\n\r\nsavings into circulation, we would get on faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I pass on to some of the attacks made on the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon\r\n\r\nMong)  pictured  the Government as saying  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  no need to try and save, that the people will\r\n\r\nfind  the money for us and that we do not  have  to\r\n\r\neconomise  and  he suggested that we were  building\r\n\r\nlavishly  and  wasting  our  money  on  \"frightful\"\r\n\r\nstructures and that kind of thing. We had the  same\r\n\r\nsort  of line from the Member for Sembawang  (Inche\r\n\r\nAhmad  Bin  Ibrahim) - as usual the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty   follows   the  general  Liberal   Socialist\r\n\r\nline - who suggested that our schools cost as much as\r\n\r\nif  they  were  built  of marble.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nPonggol-Tampenis  (Mr Goh Chew Chua)  referred  to\r\n\r\nthe prodigality of our Government's spending. Well,\r\n\r\nI am not going to deal with that in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a lot of points put down for reducing by\r\n\r\nten  dollars for this or that. No doubt,  we  shall\r\n\r\nget these details in the Committee of Supply. But I\r\n\r\nam  going  to make a few general remarks about  the\r\n\r\ncost of Government buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I do welcome attempts by the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  show us where we are  building  too\r\n\r\nlavishly,  if  we are, in fact, doing  so.  We  are\r\n\r\nextremely  conscious of the need  for  economy  and\r\n\r\nausterity  and  we  have  set  up  special  working\r\n\r\nparties on schools and medical buildings to try and\r\n\r\nget  the cost down. We have given increased  powers\r\n\r\nand  extended  the Public Works Standing  Committee\r\n\r\nfor  the  same  purpose and  we  have  set  up  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory Panel on Public Buildings, again  for  the\r\n\r\nsame   purpose,   and  we  have  included   on   it\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of private architects. So  we  have\r\n\r\ntried  to provide a structure to produce economical\r\n\r\nand efficient building. If we are not succeeding, I\r\n\r\nshall be glad to know, so that we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  our  buildings  still more economical;  but  I\r\n\r\ncannot  accept, unless good reasons  can  be  given\r\n\r\nwhich  have  never been given yet,  the  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat we are squandering money on buildings made  of\r\n\r\nmarble  and all that sort of thing. It is just  not\r\n\r\nso,  as  far  as  I can judge. It is  difficult  to\r\n\r\ncompare the Public Works Department buildings  with\r\n\r\nthe  sort  of  buildings that are done  by  private\r\n\r\nenterprise.  There  is only one authority  you  can\r\n\r\ncompare  with, and that is the S.I.T. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. and the Public Works Department do very much\r\n\r\nthe same work. As far as costs go, those two public\r\n\r\norganisations  do match up very closely,  which  is\r\n\r\nsignificant; but when you try and compare our costs\r\n\r\nwith  the  private sector, it turns  out  to  be  a\r\n\r\nmatter of etiquette for architects and builders not\r\n\r\nto disclose for public comparison what the costs of\r\n\r\ntheir plans are. So I have not got reliable figures\r\n\r\nand  am not able to say, \"Well, here is a plan  for\r\n\r\n25 flats built by private enterprise and here is  a\r\n\r\nplan for 25 flats built by the P.W.D. Let us have a\r\n\r\nlook  at  them and see what the different items  in\r\n\r\nthe  specification were, see what the costing  was,\r\n\r\nsee  what  the tenders were and see what the  final\r\n\r\nbuilding  cost  was.\" Apparently,  you  cannot  get\r\n\r\nthese  figures,  but if Members of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwere to feel that those figures ought to be brought\r\n\r\nout,  I  suggest  that  they  take  it  up  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  Committee. Mr Speaker will be directing\r\n\r\nthem  and they will have the function of suggesting\r\n\r\nwhere economies can be made consistent with policy.\r\n\r\nI  think  it might be a very useful thing  if  they\r\n\r\ncould   get  some  experts  in  and,  without   any\r\n\r\npartiality, try to get a genuine assessment of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding industry, because the building industry is\r\n\r\nhaving  a  rather difficult time now and, in  fact,\r\n\r\ncontractors  are tending to drop out  of  business.\r\n\r\nOne  or two have gone bankrupt; tenders are falling\r\n\r\noff and prices are rising. It might be a good thing\r\n\r\nto have a look at the causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy therefore to make effective\r\n\r\ncomparisons with the private sector but we can make\r\n\r\ncomparisons   with   primary   schools   in   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  We  have  now got our  standard  three-storeyed primary school down to a cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  $350 per pupil. That takes in the playing field\r\n\r\nand  ancillary  services as well as a  big  school.\r\n\r\nThat  is the average cost, of course, as one school\r\n\r\ncan  be  more  costly to construct because  of  the\r\n\r\nsite.  On the old plan, the cost was $430 per pupil\r\n\r\nand  in  that  saving of $80 we have  absorbed  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  increase in prices. That is the figure  at\r\n\r\npresent:  $350  per pupil for the  school  complete\r\n\r\nwith  its  playing field and all services.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, for the rather low average type  of\r\n\r\nprimary school, the cost is $1,190 per pupil, which\r\n\r\nis  approximately three times more.  Similarly,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, our secondary schools work out  at  $704\r\n\r\nper  pupil whilst, in the United Kingdom, they come\r\n\r\nout  at  $2,394.  The  United Kingdom  builds  very\r\n\r\nlavishly.  Somewhere here I have a  letter  from  a\r\n\r\nfriend  which came this morning. It has nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo  with building cost, but it mentions that  small\r\n\r\nchildren go direct to their own cloakroom from  the\r\n\r\nclassroom. They have pegs put up at the height of a\r\n\r\nchild;  the  water closets have special  seats  and\r\n\r\ntheir  hand-basins are special low  ones  with  hot\r\n\r\nwater  laid on; each child has his own towel marked\r\n\r\nwith  his own symbols - cat or dog or flower, and  so\r\n\r\non.  The  classroom  has the cloakroom  next  door.\r\n\r\nWell,  that is a lovely school but we cannot afford\r\n\r\nit  in  Singapore  and they do build  at  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard in Britain, and provide more amenities. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we do not have to provide heating and  our\r\n\r\nwages costs form a smaller part of total costs than\r\n\r\nthey  do  in the United Kingdom; but, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nit is very creditable indeed that our school prices\r\n\r\nshould be relatively so low and if hon. Members can\r\n\r\nshow  us  any  way  of getting  them  down  further\r\n\r\nwithout  improper  sacrifices of quality,  I  shall\r\n\r\npersonally  be  highly delighted. I  might  mention\r\n\r\nprefabricated aluminium schools made in the  U.S.A.\r\n\r\nor  in  the  U.K., and sold in South  Africa - or  in\r\n\r\nBritain   for   that   matter.  A   single-storeyed\r\n\r\nprefabricated aluminium school costs more than  the\r\n\r\nsingle three-storey P.W.D. standard schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Deliberately left here -->Hon. Members heard talk about medical costs as\r\n\r\nwell.  They are not so easy to compare. It  is  not\r\n\r\neasy  to  control either, for that matter,  because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoctor will say, \"You must have this. If not, it is\r\n\r\nnot  healthy.\"  It is difficult  to  argue  with  a\r\n\r\ndoctor  but  I can give you one set of  figures  on\r\n\r\nthis.  The probationer nurses hostel was originally\r\n\r\nentered, I think, at $880,000 and when the detailed\r\n\r\ndesigning  was  done,  that  brought  it  down   to\r\n\r\n$770,000  and  the  actual cost  achieved  (through\r\n\r\neconomy in finishes primarily) was $680,000,  which\r\n\r\nwas a saving of $90,000. Well, that is the sort  of\r\n\r\napproach  which  I  have been  trying  to  make  to\r\n\r\nbuildings - to  try  and get the cost  down,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould  not bring the cost down, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  the extent that we put up the maintenance cost.\r\n\r\nYou can put in very cheap bricks in the wall but if\r\n\r\nthey  are too cheap, perhaps they will crumble away\r\n\r\nand  fall  down. I have seen bricks which  you  can\r\n\r\npick  up and crumble in your fingers as though they\r\n\r\nwere a piece of earth and I saw them going into the\r\n\r\nwalls   of  a  building.  The  building  is   still\r\n\r\nstanding. I do not know how long it will stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw attention to the P.W.D. Report of\r\n\r\n1955  which  shows the capital value of  Government\r\n\r\nbuildings   as   nearly  $221   million   and   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance costs, expressed as a percentage of the\r\n\r\ncapital  value, for permanent buildings is .99  per\r\n\r\ncent,  for semi-permanent buildings 1.79 per  cent,\r\n\r\nand  for  temporary buildings 3.79 per cent.  Those\r\n\r\nare  low maintenance costs, I think; but if you  do\r\n\r\nnot  keep  your standards high, you will  get  very\r\n\r\nheavy  maintenance costs as soon as  the  buildings\r\n\r\ncease  to be new and get some hard wear. That  will\r\n\r\nrun    up    your   recurrent   expenditure    very\r\n\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to remark that\r\n\r\nwe  had some very warm and emphatic praise for  the\r\n\r\nprivate builders from the Member for Serangoon (Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Choon Mong) and I welcome the efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate   builders.  They  are  building   a   very\r\n\r\nsignificant section of the housing accommodation in\r\n\r\nSingapore but I cannot agree that the standards  to\r\n\r\nwhich   they   build  are  fully   acceptable   for\r\n\r\nGovernment buildings. I will not disclose the  name\r\n\r\nof the complainant here but it is an association of\r\n\r\nresidents  in  one  of the building  estates.  They\r\n\r\nwrote  to  me early in September. They addressed  a\r\n\r\nletter  to the agency which is running their estate\r\n\r\nand building it and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  not had a reply yet from the agency  to\r\n\r\ntheir  complaints  and  now they  write  again  two\r\n\r\nmonths later to bring up the same matter again.

Paragraph\r\n\r\n10 of it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is of course of the utmost importance to the\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  persons  who  will  be  affected\r\n\r\ndirectly  or indirectly by the Government's  policy\r\n\r\nof  unifying the passenger transport system that as\r\n\r\nclear an indication as possible should be given  of\r\n\r\nthe  target  dates for the various  stages  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of that policy. It is expected  that\r\n\r\nthe  adviser  will  require  a  year  in  which  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  his  reports  and that  consideration  of\r\n\r\nthese and preparations for putting them into effect\r\n\r\nwill  require a further six months. The  assumption\r\n\r\nby  a  unified  undertaking of  responsibility  for\r\n\r\noperating  any bus services will not  therefore  be\r\n\r\npossible before the middle of 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think it is fair enough for the\r\n\r\nOpposition to say, \"Too late\", but it is  not  fair\r\n\r\nfor  them to say, \"You should have put for the 1957\r\n\r\nEstimates  what is going to be spent in 1958.\"  Nor\r\n\r\ndo  I think it is well advised of them to say,  \"We\r\n\r\nwill  put  down in public the figure we propose  to\r\n\r\npay  before  we  have  completed  the  process   of\r\n\r\nnegotiation.\"  Either it will be too  high  and  we\r\n\r\nshall be throwing away our money or it will be  too\r\n\r\nlow  and  we  shall  be  accused  of  cheating  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  However, the Opposition have  brought\r\n\r\nit upon themselves. They must do their homework and\r\n\r\nthat is all I can say about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a few other points as quickly as I\r\n\r\ncan.  We  had  a  question  about  the  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nTerminal Building's cost being high and whether  it\r\n\r\nincludes  a hotel or does not include a  hotel.  It\r\n\r\nwill   include  necessarily  a  few  bedrooms   for\r\n\r\nemergencies for sick people brought from planes  or\r\n\r\ncases  like  that.  You  may  have  somebody  whose\r\n\r\npassport is not valid or a person who has  been  in\r\n\r\ncontact   with   a  suspect  may  need   a   health\r\n\r\ncertificate and he may have to be kept  within  the\r\n\r\nsanitary cordon. You have to keep him there and you\r\n\r\nhave to provide a few overnight rooms for that sort\r\n\r\nof special accommodation; but nothing in the nature\r\n\r\nof  a  hotel  is contemplated. I would remark  that\r\n\r\nalthough   the  cost  of  the  permanent   Terminal\r\n\r\nBuilding is considerable, the revenue even  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  temporary building is good. It is  running\r\n\r\nat  about  33 per cent of the all-in cost  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Civil  Aviation  headquarters  for   the\r\n\r\nairport  and  for the Regional Air Traffic  Control\r\n\r\nCentre.  If you take the direct cost of the airport\r\n\r\nonly, it is running at about 80 per cent revenue as\r\n\r\ncompared  to cost and that is within 18  months  of\r\n\r\nits opening. In other parts of the world, the ratio\r\n\r\nof  the cost to revenue ranges from 10 per cent  to\r\n\r\n36  per cent so that though we are not right up  at\r\n\r\nthe  top,  we are very near the top for  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld. The concentration of figures is about 30 per\r\n\r\ncent.  That  is the median point, I think,  in  the\r\n\r\nline; we are above the median point. I hope that we\r\n\r\nshall  improve on those figures and I would  remark\r\n\r\nthat in the trip to Britain which I had to take  in\r\n\r\nan aeroplane - which I regard as a most uncomfortable\r\n\r\nway  of travelling, if I may say so - I thought  that\r\n\r\nthe  airports through which I had to pass - when  you\r\n\r\nget  down  for two hours or an hour and a  half  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  longer  in going in and out  of  them - were\r\n\r\ndepressing places. I am sure that it is worth while\r\n\r\nto  have  a  really good airport in Singapore.  You\r\n\r\nwill  get  people staying overnight bringing  money\r\n\r\ninto  the  place  and you will get your  air  lines\r\n\r\ncoming   here   instead  of  going  to  alternative\r\n\r\nairports  because  it  is an attractive  place.  We\r\n\r\nought to make things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattractive for the passengers so that I think  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a good case for giving Singapore a really\r\n\r\ngood  airport,  partly because you  will  get  more\r\n\r\nrevenue out of it and partly because it will be  an\r\n\r\nattraction to the travelling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had a number of references to personal\r\n\r\nemoluments: suggestions that we ought  to  cut  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service - I  am not quite sure  whether  these\r\n\r\nadvocates of economy wanted to cut the salaries  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  or to reduce the number  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants. I doubt if they seriously think that they\r\n\r\ncould  do either unless they want to get a  general\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  a  cut in the  life  of  the  whole\r\n\r\neconomy.  But I would like to stress that,  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  of  the  Ministry  for  which   I   am\r\n\r\nresponsible,   we  are  providing   essential   and\r\n\r\nexpanding services for Singapore and I hope that we\r\n\r\nshall  not have any nonsense about cutting personal\r\n\r\nemoluments in things like the postal services where\r\n\r\nthe mail handled increased from 57 million items in\r\n\r\n1949 to 92 million items this year. We are not  far\r\n\r\noff from having doubled the number of items handled\r\n\r\nin  the course of the year but we are very far from\r\n\r\nhaving doubled the staff and, in the same way,  the\r\n\r\nsavings  bank which is handled by the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nhas  also, I think, about doubled the number of its\r\n\r\nsubscribers. These postal services are, of  course,\r\n\r\nshowing  their usual satisfactory rates of  profit,\r\n\r\nand  for the Telecommunications Department as well,\r\n\r\nthe  revenue is expanding on the basis of providing\r\n\r\nservices  which  are needed by the people  of  this\r\n\r\ncity. Both the Press and commerce and industry need\r\n\r\nthese   services.   They   get   them   from    the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Department  and  they  pay  for\r\n\r\nthem.  The  revenue which was under $5  million  in 1956 is expected to approach $6 million in 1957. In 1953,  it was just over $3 million. The revenue  of\r\n\r\nthe Telecommunications Department is expanding very\r\n\r\nsignificantly  in  relation  to  the  services   it\r\n\r\nperforms, which are valued and wanted by the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  In  the Civil Aviation  Department,\r\n\r\nagain, I find our passenger traffic has expanded by\r\n\r\nabout  25 per cent since the new airport was opened\r\n\r\nand, compared with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnormal  world  average expansion of about  15  per\r\n\r\ncent per annum in passengers, we are well ahead of\r\n\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I might mention very briefly.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall) expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  about taxi-owners having to pay  the  new\r\n\r\nregistration   fee  on  their   taxis.   He   will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that the details of this  impost  were\r\n\r\nworked out whilst I was away but we are having  it\r\n\r\nlooked  into in the Ministry. The machinery  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  complex between the Finance  Ministry,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, and the Registrar of Vehicles and  there\r\n\r\nare  other  hands  that have to go  into  the  pie\r\n\r\nbefore we can work out the recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there are one or two points  raised\r\n\r\nby  the Opposition concerning my Ministry to which\r\n\r\nI think I should reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon this morning drew the\r\n\r\nattention  of  this Assembly to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nrents  of Trust houses. He says that in Boon  Keng\r\n\r\nRoad, the S.I.T. houses are being let out at  $110\r\n\r\neach  a  month, whereas the same type of  premises\r\n\r\nbuilt  by private enterprise are being let out  at\r\n\r\n$75 each per month. The fact is that there are  no\r\n\r\nS.I.T. houses which are being let out at $110, but\r\n\r\nthey  are rented out at two rates - at $89  and  $99\r\n\r\nrespectively, but inclusive of services the  rents\r\n\r\nare  $96  and  $105  respectively.  The  rents  of\r\n\r\npostwar  houses  can  and  do  differ  since  they\r\n\r\nreflect the year in which they were built and  the\r\n\r\nbuilding costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then come to the question of car shelters for\r\n\r\nS.I.T. officers. Here again, I am afraid that  the\r\n\r\nMember  was  wrong  because car shelters  for  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. were  meant for the employees employed  by\r\n\r\nthe    Singapore   Improvement   Trust   and   are\r\n\r\napportioned  between both the European  and  Asian\r\n\r\nstaff  and between both junior and senior officers\r\n\r\non  a  basis of first come, first served. So there\r\n\r\nis  no  question of discrimination. In  any  case,\r\n\r\nthis is a legacy from the Progressive Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which was raised by two\r\n\r\nMembers   of  the  Opposition:  the  question   of\r\n\r\ncollection  of  arrears  of  rents  on   Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation  Licences due to the gross inefficiency\r\n\r\nof  the Rural Board and the Land Office. It is not\r\n\r\nan  evil  of  this Government since it  came  into\r\n\r\nbeing.  There  have  been  arrears  of  rents   on\r\n\r\nTemporary Occupation Licences from prewar days and\r\n\r\nit  is an evil which the Rural Board and the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice are trying to eradicate. It is not easy  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problems of arrears of  rents  due  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  on Temporary Occupation  Licences,  as\r\n\r\nany landlord in Singapore can tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, the year 1957\r\n\r\nwill  be  yet  another stage in the  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial development of Singapore in the history  of\r\n\r\nthe  elected Government. Sir, the experience which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  gained during  the  past  18\r\n\r\nmonths  has been well used in the planning of  the 1957  Estimates.  Being the  Member  for  a  rural\r\n\r\nconstituency, Sir, I believe that these  Estimates\r\n\r\nshow  a  brighter future for the rural population.\r\n\r\nThere  are  very  many items  like  bus  shelters,\r\n\r\nfootpaths, roads in resettlements, the development\r\n\r\nof  playing  fields,  public markets,  standpipes,\r\n\r\netc.,  which  are all included in the  Budget  for 1957. I feel that, with the implementation of  all\r\n\r\nthese  services  in  1957, the rural  people  will\r\n\r\nreally feel that the money allotted to these works\r\n\r\nis  well  spent. Although this may not be adequate\r\n\r\nto  meet  their  requirements, I feel,  with  some\r\n\r\njustification, that a great many more improvements\r\n\r\nwill  be taking place in 1957 than in 1956.  There\r\n\r\nwill be some other matters which might affect  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of the rural population and I\r\n\r\nam   sure  the  Government  will  look  into  them\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one question raised about the salaries\r\n\r\npaid  to  the staff of the Government, Sir,  by  a\r\n\r\nMember of the Opposition. I feel sure that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for anybody to reduce the existing\r\n\r\nsalaries  in  order  to show  a  decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member of the Opposition, Sir, also referred\r\n\r\nto Ministers who own cars, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe said that only Ministers were allowed to possess\r\n\r\ncars. He also said that a certain Minister had told\r\n\r\nhim that if he was not a Member of the Assembly, he\r\n\r\nwould not be able to possess a car. Sir, I wish  to\r\n\r\nanswer  this Member by saying that a car  is  being\r\n\r\nused by me not as a luxury, but just as a means  of\r\n\r\nexpediting my work as a Member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also feel that there is justification for\r\n\r\nallotting    adequate    money    for    charitable\r\n\r\norganisations. A Member of the Opposition said that\r\n\r\nall  these  contributions were not very  essential.\r\n\r\nSir, I have seen many projects which have been paid\r\n\r\nfor   by   the   public  through  these   voluntary\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations. In Singapore, too,  these\r\n\r\norganisations  play a great part in helping  people\r\n\r\nby  various  means. I feel that  it  is  right  and\r\n\r\nproper  for any government to give adequate aid  to\r\n\r\nvoluntary charitable organisations which would help\r\n\r\npeople to a very large extent generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that these Estimates will go a long\r\n\r\nway towards the provision of more amenities for the\r\n\r\npeople in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have replied to almost all the questions\r\n\r\nraised by the Members of the Opposition. There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, one matter which I would like to speak on,\r\n\r\nand that is about the Income Tax Ordinance. As hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   know,   the  Income  Tax   Ordinance   is\r\n\r\nadministered  on  a  pan-Malayan  basis,  and   any\r\n\r\nproposed changes in the rates of tax must have  the\r\n\r\nagreement  of  both Governments. In view  of  this,\r\n\r\nthere  have been prior discussions between the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments  and  it  was after such  consultations\r\n\r\nthat a compromise was reached, and both Governments\r\n\r\nsubmitted  the  proposed changes simultaneously  to\r\n\r\ntheir two Legislatures on 7th November. Since then,\r\n\r\nstrong  opposition has been expressed in the Press,\r\n\r\nand  also  in  letters to the  Government  by  many\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public, including  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress, to the proposed reduction in\r\n\r\nthe  personal  allowance  from  $3,000  to  $2,500.\r\n\r\nCriticism was also expressed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate  in the Federation  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this strong opposition served to confirm the\r\n\r\nview  that this Government had that such a proposed\r\n\r\nreduction would not meet with general approval, but\r\n\r\nbefore  this  proposal could be withdrawn,  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  this Government to reach  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  our Federation friends. I therefore  flew  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  on  the morning of  Wednesday,  14th\r\n\r\nNovember,  and had discussions with the  Federation\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. The Federation\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council, Sir, had however  passed  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading of the Appropriation Bill  on  13th\r\n\r\nNovember, and I was therefore confronted with  this\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  My friend Tunku Abdul  Rahman  lent  a\r\n\r\nvery sympathetic and understanding ear to the views\r\n\r\nwhich  I  expressed to him. I explained  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  felt  that it should  not  impose  this\r\n\r\nproposed  reduction against such strong  opposition\r\n\r\nbut  that  if his Government should feel  that,  as\r\n\r\ntheir  Appropriation Bill had  already  passed  its\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading, it should therefore not  make  any\r\n\r\nchanges.  I said that this Government was  prepared\r\n\r\nto stand by the compromise reached with them. Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman told me that he would have to consult\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues and that he would give his  support\r\n\r\nto   my   representations.  The  result  of   these\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  Sir, is now known  to  hon.  Members.\r\n\r\nOnce  again,  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  has  shown  his\r\n\r\nfriendly  attitude to Singapore and my  colleagues.\r\n\r\nand  I  greatly appreciate this. In the short space\r\n\r\nof   less   than  one  month, he  has  given   two\r\n\r\noutstanding  instances of his great friendship  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and we look forward to a happier  and  a\r\n\r\ncloser   relationship  with  our  friends  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate\r\n\r\nhas  been  long  and very interesting  and  I  find\r\n\r\nmyself in the happy position of having had most  of\r\n\r\nthe  questions asked by the Opposition answered for\r\n\r\nme  by  my  colleagues. I may  perhaps  be  allowed\r\n\r\nhowever  to  deal  with one or two  which  I  think\r\n\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, one or two Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  have questioned the need for  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation.  The argument is based on the fact  that,\r\n\r\nin  the  past, estimated deficits have been  turned\r\n\r\ninto  surpluses  and, indeed,  the  estimate  of  a\r\n\r\ndeficit which I myself made last year has, in fact,\r\n\r\nbeen  turned  into a very small surplus.  I  would,\r\n\r\nhowever,  draw attention to the fact that,  whereas\r\n\r\nin  the past, surpluses have been very substantial,\r\n\r\nthe  surplus  in 1956 has been reduced  to  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall amount indeed. I would also draw attention to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that estimated expenditure is now  higher\r\n\r\nthan  it  has ever been before. All this  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure will have to be met sooner or later.  I\r\n\r\ndo  think,  however, on the basis of experience  of\r\n\r\nprevious  years, that there  will  be  savings  on\r\n\r\npersonal emoluments and there may perhaps be  small\r\n\r\nsavings  on  Other Charges Annually  Recurrent  and\r\n\r\nthere  certainly will be a small number of  revotes\r\n\r\nin  Other  Charges  Special Expenditure.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I think that something of the  order\r\n\r\nof  $17 to $18 million of the estimated deficit  of\r\n\r\n$37  million  will be underspent  but  there  will\r\n\r\nremain  the hard core of something of the order  of\r\n\r\n$18 million to be met by increased taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members have stressed the necessity for\r\n\r\neconomies   in  Government  expenditure.   I   must\r\n\r\nemphasise that it is the intention of Government to\r\n\r\npractise stringent economy and to effect savings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwherever  they can be made. This process  has  been\r\n\r\nstarted  and  is continuing. The greatest  possible\r\n\r\ncontrol   was   exercised  at  the  time   of   the\r\n\r\npreparation  of the Budget, and the expenditure  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments  has  been  reduced  to   a\r\n\r\nminimum. I think hon. Members will have noted  from\r\n\r\nthe  Schedules which have been presented this  year\r\n\r\nthat  the  amount of applications for supplementary\r\n\r\nvotes has been very considerably reduced this  year\r\n\r\nby  comparison with other years. Hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nalso  note  in the Estimates that in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nOther  Charges Annually Recurrent, apart  from  the\r\n\r\nvery  substantial  increase  in  education  and  in\r\n\r\npensions, the increase in the estimated expenditure\r\n\r\nof other departments is comparatively small. Again,\r\n\r\nSpecial Expenditure has been drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention has been drawn by Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  the  fact that personal  emoluments\r\n\r\nhave  increased by $13 million in the coming  year.\r\n\r\nThis is not surprising, Sir. The medical and health\r\n\r\nand  education services are expanding very  rapidly\r\n\r\nindeed  and, as will be seen from the list  of  new\r\n\r\nappointments   given   in  the   memorandum   which\r\n\r\naccompanied the Estimates, over 70 per cent of  the\r\n\r\nnew  appointments are in the Medical  or  Education\r\n\r\nDepartments.  In the case of all other departments,\r\n\r\nnew  posts have been reduced to an absolute minimum\r\n\r\nand  have only been allowed where they are required\r\n\r\nfor  the efficient discharge of Government business\r\n\r\nor  where  they  will  result  in  an  increase  of\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention has also been drawn to the very high\r\n\r\npercentage which personal emoluments bear to  other\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure. I myself do not  find  this\r\n\r\nvery  surprising. Government does provide  services\r\n\r\nfor the public and services can only be provided by\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to taxation, Sir, my colleague the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has explained the circumstances  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  personal reliefs were restored  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious  level. I will not touch upon  the  matter\r\n\r\nfurther  except to say that - I speak as an official\r\n\r\nrather  than  as  a Minister - at the  present  time,\r\n\r\n19,000 people in Singapore out of a total of 1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion pay income tax and this position cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to  last for very long. More people  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  made  subject  to  tax  and  personal\r\n\r\nallowances will have to be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members on the other side of the House  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that the raising of the rate of  tax  on\r\n\r\nthe  first  two slabs of taxable income will  cause\r\n\r\nhardship: in short, that the raising of the rate of\r\n\r\ntax  from  three  per cent on  the  first  slab  of\r\n\r\ntaxable  income, and four per cent  on  the  second\r\n\r\nslab  to  five per cent will cause hardship.  This,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  cannot believe, and I should like to  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to  quote figures  to  show  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  tax resulting from these changes.  I\r\n\r\nspeak now, Sir, of chargeable income, that is,  the\r\n\r\namount of income which is subject to tax after  all\r\n\r\nallowances  have been subtracted. On  a  chargeable\r\n\r\nincome of $200, the old rate of tax was $6 and  the\r\n\r\nnew  rate  of tax is $10. Therefore, an  individual\r\n\r\nwho has an income of $3,200 will pay $10 instead of\r\n\r\n$6. On a chargeable income of $500, the old rate of\r\n\r\ntax  was $15, and the new rate of tax will be  $25.\r\n\r\nOn a chargeable income of $700, the old rate of tax\r\n\r\nwas  $23  and  the new rate of tax  is  $35.  On  a\r\n\r\nchargeable income of $1,000, the old rate  of  tax\r\n\r\nwas $35 and the new rate of tax is $50. Thereafter,\r\n\r\nright up the scale, the result of these changes  of\r\n\r\nrates  on the first two slabs of taxable income  is\r\n\r\n$15.  I  cannot  believe that these increases  will\r\n\r\ncause hardship to anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) asked what the\r\n\r\nyield  from this particular change in the  rate  of\r\n\r\ntax  would  be. I regret that I have  not  got  the\r\n\r\nfigures with me but, speaking from memory, I  think\r\n\r\nit  will  be of the order of $250,000 but  that  is\r\n\r\nsubject  to  correction. It  has  been  asked  what\r\n\r\njustification there was for imposing this  rate  of\r\n\r\ntax  which might cause hardship when the yield  was\r\n\r\nso low. I did draw attention in my Budget speech to\r\n\r\nthe fact that the low rate of tax at the bottom  of\r\n\r\nthe scale was perhaps uneconomic. This increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  rate may render it economic. I think that  the\r\n\r\namendments to the rates of tax on the higher groups\r\n\r\nof chargeable income have the general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  House and I agree  that,  without\r\n\r\ncausing  hardship, these rates could very  well  be\r\n\r\nincreased,  and I hope that both Governments  will,\r\n\r\nin the future, see their way to increase the rates.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, in all fairness to the taxpayers\r\n\r\nin  the  higher income groups, I should  point  out\r\n\r\nthat on the basis of 1955 figures, 19,000 taxpayers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore paid $22 million worth of tax.  There\r\n\r\nare,  out  of these 19,000 taxpayers, approximately\r\n\r\n1,200  people who have chargeable income of $30,000\r\n\r\nor  more,  that is, six per cent of all  taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThis six per cent paid almost $16 million or 68 per\r\n\r\ncent of the tax coming from individuals. So I think\r\n\r\nhon. Members will agree that, while the rate of tax\r\n\r\non   these   incomes  might  be  increased,   these\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  do  already  make  a  not  unsubstantial\r\n\r\ncontribution to the welfare of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to company tax, as my friend and\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Chief Minister said, it  is  a  pan-Malayan matter and the desirability or otherwise of\r\n\r\nincreasing the rate of company tax was discussed at\r\n\r\ngreat  length with our colleagues in Kuala  Lumpur,\r\n\r\nand  the  Members of both Governments came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that it would be inappropriate  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time to increase the rate of company  tax.\r\n\r\nThe  reason for this decision I gave in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall)\r\n\r\nasked  whether the question of excess  profits  tax\r\n\r\nhad  been considered and I can assure him that this\r\n\r\nquestion  and  other  similar  proposals  such   as\r\n\r\nsurtax, were considered but it was decided that  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be appropriate at the present  time  to\r\n\r\nimpose such taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing to the question of tobacco, hon. Members\r\n\r\nare  now aware that the rate of tax on what I  call\r\n\r\nthe   Rhodesian  type  tobacco  imported  for   the\r\n\r\nmanufacture  of  local machine made cigarettes  has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced to pre-Budget levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also draw the attention of hon. Members\r\n\r\nto  the  fact  that, as a result of representations\r\n\r\nfrom   the   local  manufacturers  of  cigars   and\r\n\r\ncheroots, the rate of tax on leaf tobacco  will  be\r\n\r\nrestored in the near future to pre-Budget levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and colleague the Chief Minister has\r\n\r\nexplained that we did consider the question of  tax\r\n\r\non  a  sliding scale on motorcars but  in  the  end\r\n\r\ndecided that a flat rate would be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that there are many further points\r\n\r\nthat  I  should touch on, Sir. The question of  the\r\n\r\nluxury  tax  will be debated fully  in  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Bill tomorrow. I would however  like\r\n\r\nto take this opportunity to say that the Government\r\n\r\nis fully seized of the necessity for preserving the\r\n\r\nentrepot   trade  and  doing  nothing  which   will\r\n\r\njeopardise  that  trade  and,  at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\njeopardise the prosperity of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) suggested that,\r\n\r\nbefore we increase rates of income tax, it would be\r\n\r\nbetter to stop evasion of tax at present rates.  He\r\n\r\nquestioned whether the team of investigators  which\r\n\r\nhad  been  built up had achieved the objects  which\r\n\r\nwere  intended.  The  question of  examination  and\r\n\r\ninvestigation of evasion started seriously  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of 1954 and I am sure hon. Members will  be\r\n\r\ngratified  to  know  that the  investigation  team,\r\n\r\nstarting off as one man with subordinate assistants\r\n\r\nand increasing in 1955 to two men and this year  to\r\n\r\nthree   men,   has  achieved  the   collection   of\r\n\r\napproximately $5 million worth of tax  which  would\r\n\r\notherwise have been lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend the Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall)\r\n\r\nquestioned  the desirability of charging  long-term\r\n\r\nloans  to the Singapore Improvement Trust and other\r\n\r\nbodies  to expenditure. The reasons why we  propose\r\n\r\nto  follow  this  course were given  in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech and I do not think that I need repeat  them.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members,  of course, are aware that  although\r\n\r\nthese  loans  are withdrawn from the  Statement  of\r\n\r\nAssets  and Liabilities, they appear in Appendix  F\r\n\r\nof   the   Estimates.  The  Member  for   Cairnhill\r\n\r\nsuggested,  however, that a note might be  made  at\r\n\r\nthe foot of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities\r\n\r\ndrawing attention to the fact that these loans were\r\n\r\nshown in another place in the Estimates and I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that that was my original intention. I  regret\r\n\r\nthat this note was not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  in the copy of the draft Estimates now before\r\n\r\nyou but it will be made in the final copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) asked certain\r\n\r\nquestions  about the Central Provident Fund  and  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  he  direct  his  enquiries  to   the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Provident Fund Board. The Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board  is  a statutory corporation  which  is\r\n\r\nentirely  independent of Government.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  however,  I  must say  that  the  Board  has\r\n\r\ncontributed largely to local loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member, Sir, I think it was the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong), made reference  to\r\n\r\nrenting S.I.T. flats at $100 a month. I should like\r\n\r\nto make it clear that out of the 11,000 flats owned\r\n\r\nby the S.I.T., approximately 300 bear rents of over\r\n\r\n$90.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, concludes the remarks that I wish to\r\n\r\nmake  on  today's debate and I now beg to move  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Division.
