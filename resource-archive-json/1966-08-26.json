However, it\r\n\r\nis  the  common  practice that foreign  titles  and\r\n\r\ndecorations can be used at any function given by or\r\n\r\nin the country of origin. And in any case, I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve that those Singapore citizens with any self-respect, while they cherish the honour bestowed  on\r\n\r\nthem  by  past colonial governments or  by  foreign\r\n\r\ngovernments,  will  want to distinguish  themselves\r\n\r\nfrom  the rest of the people of Singapore by  being\r\n\r\npublicly referred to by their title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>1967 PRIMARY I CLASSES IN KAMPONG KEMBANGAN</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Up  till\r\n\r\nthe  end of July, there have been 7 dismissals  and\r\n\r\nanother   22   are  the  subject  of   disciplinary\r\n\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other important reorganisation steps which have\r\n\r\nbeen taken, so far, are as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In October 1965, recruitment of an auxiliary\r\n\r\npublic  cleansing force known as the Emergency\r\n\r\nCleansing Corps was started. This is a uniformed\r\n\r\nand  disciplined task force, and the basis  of\r\n\r\nrecruitment is from two sources, namely, the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade and from the thousands of our unemployed\r\n\r\ncitizens,  now  in receipt of  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Emergency Cleansing Corps\r\n\r\ntoday  is  624 and this is being stepped  up,\r\n\r\nwithout  limit at present, to  keep  up  with\r\n\r\nrequirements  of reorganisation  for  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient   public   cleansing   service   in\r\n\r\nSingapore than is available at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In May this year, overtime work (at 1\u00bd\r\n\r\nrates)  during  weekdays was stopped,  unless\r\n\r\nat   the  request  of  the  Public  Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment.

It\r\n\r\nshould be brought home to the knowledge of this\r\n\r\nHouse that, as a rule, the amount of refuse cleared\r\n\r\non Sundays and public holidays\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(after  paying  double and treble  rates)  is\r\n\r\nless  than  what is cleared during  a  normal\r\n\r\nweekday!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It is also necessary for me now to reveal\r\n\r\ncertain  startling facts why public cleansing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore    needs    wholesale    reorganisation\r\n\r\ninvolving   even  its  pattern  of  work   before\r\n\r\ncontemplating any expansion of work force:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Out of 184,431 assessed buildings in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there are only 48,345 dust-bins or 26\r\n\r\nper cent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Out of a daily collection of over 600 tons of\r\n\r\nrefuse, an estimated 245 tons or 40 per cent is\r\n\r\nremoved by direct collection from household dust-bins, and this involves 230 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) There is therefore an estimated 60\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  refuse  which  has  to  be\r\n\r\nlaboriously  swept up  by  hand,  dug  up\r\n\r\nfrom  drains,  put into  hand-carts,  and\r\n\r\nthen  pushed  to  and placed  into  large\r\n\r\npublic   dust-bins  at   over   500   bin\r\n\r\ncentres, by nearly 2,000 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of this refuse, not collected from dust-bins, is largely due to certain irresponsible\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  public,  including  hawkers  and\r\n\r\nhouseholders, who indiscriminately throw refuse  on\r\n\r\nto  roads  and into drains or any vacant  piece  of\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised pattern of work on re-organisation\r\n\r\nwill include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A gradual switch-over to one or more\r\n\r\ndirect   collection  and   less   of   street\r\n\r\ncleansing.

In 1964, out  of  an\r\n\r\napproved  establishment of 453 doctors, there  were\r\n\r\n97  --  almost 100 -- vacancies, but as at 31st  July\r\n\r\nthis  year,  the position is 461 on approved  establishment  with  37  vacancies  or  a  60  per  cent\r\n\r\nimprovement over that of 1\u00bd years ago. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nit  is confidently expected that all vacancies  are\r\n\r\nlikely to be filled by 1967 next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the steps taken to improve the situation,\r\n\r\nother  than  a review of salaries which  is  to  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  the  Salaries  Commission  now   in\r\n\r\nsession, we have already reorganised the pattern of\r\n\r\nwork  for  doctors in service, in order  to  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir  work-load as much as possible and  generally\r\n\r\nto improve their conditions of work, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) In August 1964, the Outpatient Dispensary in\r\n\r\nOutram Road General Hospital was closed  down\r\n\r\nand  the outpatient service decentralised to 26 Outpatient Dispensaries with simultaneous\r\n\r\nintroduction of a token charge  of  50  cents\r\n\r\nper  attendance. This firm move  has  brought\r\n\r\nabout  an  improved service  for  the  public\r\n\r\nbecause  waiting  time has  been  drastically\r\n\r\ncut  down as malingerers were weeded out  and\r\n\r\ndoctors  can now spend more time  with  their\r\n\r\npatients.   This   is   reflected   in    the\r\n\r\nsignificant    drop   in    attendances    at\r\n\r\nGovernment Outpatient Dispensaries  from  the\r\n\r\npeak  figure  of 2.7 million in 1963  to  2.1\r\n\r\nmillion in 1965 (last year).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In December 1964, a nominal charge of $10\r\n\r\nfor  'C'  class  patients was  introduced  in\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Maternity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHospital  in  an  endeavour  to  cut  down  the\r\n\r\nexcessive number of deliveries at this  grossly\r\n\r\nover-worked hospital and instead to  popularise\r\n\r\nthe  free domiciliary midwifery service.  Added\r\n\r\nto  this was the launching of a massive  5-year\r\n\r\nfamily    planning   campaign    through    the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the  Family   Planning   and\r\n\r\nPopulation Board in January this year with  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of reducing our present  birth  rate\r\n\r\nof  29  per thousand by one-half. I am  pleased\r\n\r\nto  state  that  there are  strong  indications\r\n\r\nthat   our  womenfolk  are  responding   whole-heartedly towards family planning in  order  to\r\n\r\nhave  smaller yet happier families. During  the\r\n\r\nlast  seven  months, over 19,000  mothers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given family planning assistance  by  the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning and Population Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We have also adopted a liberal policy towards\r\n\r\nemployment  of  doctors  with  so-called   non-registrable  degrees  as  far  as  the   United\r\n\r\nKingdom  General Medical Council is  concerned,\r\n\r\nso   long  as  there  exists  a  large  vacancy\r\n\r\nsituation  on  our doctor establishment  as  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is shown by the number of such doctors now in service:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                   Appointed prior to June 1959           1\r\n\r\n                   Appointed between  June 1959           \r\n\r\n                     and September 1963                   3 \r\n\r\n                   Appointed between October 1963         \r\n\r\n                     and present                          8\r\n\r\n                                                         --\r\n\r\n                                      Total              12\r\n\r\n                                                         ==   \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEGOTIATIONS ON COMMON CURRENCY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Request for statement)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  if  he will make a statement on  (a)  what\r\n\r\ntranspired   in  the  negotiations  on   a   common\r\n\r\ncurrency; (b) why no agreement was reached  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of those negotiations; and (c) the position\r\n\r\nof currency in Singapore after the 12th June, 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will be\r\n\r\nmaking a statement later on to the House which will\r\n\r\nanswer  all  the queries raised by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Alternatively,  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia could establish a joint Central Bank. Both\r\n\r\nthese   proposals  were  not  acceptable   to   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, we agreed that the officials\r\n\r\nshould  meet to find another formula for  a  common\r\n\r\ncurrency and banking system. It was then decided to\r\n\r\nask for technical assistance from the International\r\n\r\nMonetary   Fund.  And  at  the  request   of   both\r\n\r\ncountries, the I.M.F. sent a preliminary mission to\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia in December last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission reported on 1st March, 1966, and\r\n\r\nnoted  correctly  Singapore's major  pre-occupation\r\n\r\nfor  the  safety  of the foreign exchange  reserves\r\n\r\nbacking the currency. This is further emphasised by\r\n\r\nmy  letter  of 21st March, 1966, addressed  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernor of Bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara, Malaysia, in which I stated, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government wishes to be assured\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  event  of subsequent  withdrawal  by\r\n\r\neither  party from the proposed currency agreement,\r\n\r\nit should have immediate access to its share of the\r\n\r\ncurrency reserve.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it was also suggested in the same letter that\r\n\r\nanother  I.M.F. team be called to provide technical\r\n\r\nexpertise.

The  first,  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is clear from the rest of the arguments put\r\n\r\nforward by the Singapore Minister for Finance  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government is concerned chiefly with\r\n\r\n(a)  the  need to maintain its sovereign rights  in\r\n\r\nany  proposals for future currency arrangements and\r\n\r\n(b)  the  need  to safeguard its interests  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of foreign exchange reserves and the manner\r\n\r\nin  which these reserves are utilised. This concern\r\n\r\nis  of  course  justified and any  fears  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government may have on serious  breaches\r\n\r\nof  its  sovereignty or the deprivation of a  major\r\n\r\npart  of  Singapore's  external  assets  should  be\r\n\r\ndispelled entirely.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  second quotation from this memorandum  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of reserves is - I quote again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Government is probably justified\r\n\r\nin  claiming that the arrangements proposed by Bank\r\n\r\nNegara  on the control and management of the Bank's\r\n\r\nforeign exchange reserves are unsatisfactory  since\r\n\r\nthese do not provide for a \"hard core\" of assets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich would always belong to Singapore and to which\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  would  have  immediate\r\n\r\naccess   in  the  event  of  withdrawal  from   the\r\n\r\nagreement   by  either  party.  Bank   Negara   has\r\n\r\ntherefore  reviewed that aspect  of  its  proposals\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  control and  management  of  its\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  reserves and  has  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that it would be desirable to  separate\r\n\r\nthe respective reserves of the two countries at the\r\n\r\noutset of the proposed arrangements.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the Malaysians\r\n\r\ntook  cognisance of our concern over the safety  of\r\n\r\nour currency assets. Once it has been accepted that\r\n\r\nthe agreement should guarantee both Governments  of\r\n\r\ntheir  ownership, management, control and immediate\r\n\r\naccess  to  their respective assets at  all  times,\r\n\r\nformal  negotiations  began  in  earnest  with  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  another team of two officials  from\r\n\r\nthe  I.M.F.  In  all, Sir, 11 formal meetings  were\r\n\r\nheld  between the 10th of June and the 5th of July,\r\n\r\n1966,  chaired  by  the  Governor  of  Bank  Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia, Tan Sri Ismail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like here to pay tribute to all those who\r\n\r\ntook  part in the meetings, including the officials\r\n\r\nof  the I.M.F., for the intense work they put  into\r\n\r\ntheir  difficult  task to find a  formula  for  two\r\n\r\nindependent  countries to co-operate  on  a  common\r\n\r\ncurrency and banking system. Proposals and counter-proposals   were   made.  Many  difficulties   were\r\n\r\nencountered  and  overcome,  but  even  after   the\r\n\r\neleventh  meeting held on 5th July, which  happened\r\n\r\nto  be  the  last of the series, there  were  still\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to  how the ownership of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nassets were to be resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was indicated by a letter from the Governor\r\n\r\nof  Bank Negara Malaysia dated 11th July, 1966,  to\r\n\r\nthe   Permanent  Secretary  (Economic   Development\r\n\r\nDivision)  who was leading the Singapore  team.  In\r\n\r\nit, he wanted clarification as to how the piece  of\r\n\r\nland  in Singapore, which is at present in the name\r\n\r\nof  Bank Negara Malaysia, can be transferred to the\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank of Malaysia, Singapore.  He  proposed\r\n\r\nthat while the value of this land would be credited\r\n\r\nto  the  account of the Central Bank  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore, the title should remain in the  name  of\r\n\r\nBank Negara Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication of this formula was far-reaching.\r\n\r\nFor  if  we were to agree to this, it follows  that\r\n\r\nall our currency assets would have to be vested  in\r\n\r\nBank  Negara Malaysia and that this statutory  body\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  Malaysian  Government  would   be\r\n\r\nappointing  itself  the  trustee  of  our  currency\r\n\r\nreserves and assets. In other words, Sir, we  would\r\n\r\nhave to hand over legal ownership of all our assets\r\n\r\nto  a  bank  which was a statutory body of  another\r\n\r\ncountry and entirely subject to its legislation and\r\n\r\ncontrol.  This does not give us the guarantee  over\r\n\r\nthe  ownership and immediate access to  our  assets\r\n\r\nand foreign exchange reserves on the basis of which\r\n\r\nwe  began  negotiations. We must  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntitle   to  Singapore's  assets,  be  it  land   or\r\n\r\nsecurities, should be vested in Singapore,  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way that the title to the currency assets  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are  vested  in  themselves  Bank  Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Since  the  Central  Bank  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  has  no  legal  entity,  in  reply  we\r\n\r\nproposed that both our assets should be placed with\r\n\r\nthe  I.M.F. or the Bank of England  or  any  other\r\n\r\nthird party mutually acceptable as both our trustee\r\n\r\nor,  alternatively, that the Deputy  Governor  for\r\n\r\nSingapore should be incorporated into a corporation\r\n\r\nsole and all currency assets of Singapore could  be\r\n\r\nvested in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government have always agreed that\r\n\r\nour assets must belong to us and that they can have\r\n\r\nno  claims on them. The deposit with a third  party\r\n\r\nlike  the I.M.F. or the incorporation of the Deputy\r\n\r\nGovernor  as a corporation sole to hold the  assets\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that no future government in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nif  it  decides  to  give  orders  to  Bank  Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia contrary to the letter and spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nagreement between Singapore and Malaysia,  will  be\r\n\r\nin a position to jeopardise Singapore's assets. The\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government, however, could not agree that\r\n\r\nthe   assets  be  placed  in  a  third  party   and\r\n\r\nconsidered  that incorporating the Deputy  Governor\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  as  a corporation  sole  meant  the\r\n\r\ncreation of two Central Banks. We cannot agree, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with this interpretation. Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers have  advised  us  that\r\n\r\nthis  will,  in  no  way, prejudice  what  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  agreed  to,  and  that  is,  Bank   Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia should have only one legal entity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me to report, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nall  the  obvious advantages of a common  currency,\r\n\r\naffirmed  and  reaffirmed by  the  Governments  and\r\n\r\npeople  on both sides of the Causeway, have  to  be\r\n\r\nthrown  away  because our proposals  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nassets with the I.M.F. or the Bank of England or in\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Deputy Governor as a corporation\r\n\r\nsole  were  all  not acceptable and  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   no   time  to   consider   other\r\n\r\nalternatives because their printers in London  were\r\n\r\npressing  them to decide on the printing  of  their\r\n\r\nnew notes immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Speaker, I would now like to comment on\r\n\r\nthe  few points highlighted by Press reports of the\r\n\r\nreplies  to  questions by the Minister of  Finance,\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  raised in the Malaysian  Parliament.  It\r\n\r\nwas stated that the draft agreement has been agreed\r\n\r\nto  by  officials of the two countries. I will  now\r\n\r\nquote from minutes of the meeting of officials held\r\n\r\non 26th June, 1966, made by Bank Negara Malaysia:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore representatives pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  clauses which had been agreed to at  the  past\r\n\r\nseven meetings at the official level should not  be\r\n\r\nregarded as final and irreversible. They maintained\r\n\r\nthat the officials of both Governments reserved the\r\n\r\nright  to review and change the draft Agreement  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  way  necessary  in  the  light   of   the\r\n\r\nAgreement as a whole.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will  now further quote from the minutes of  the\r\n\r\neleventh  and last meeting held on 5th July,  1966,\r\n\r\nalso  recorded by Bank Negara Malaysia with  regard\r\n\r\nto  the  position  of  the working  drafts  of  the\r\n\r\nofficials:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It was noted that both the Malaysian and\r\n\r\nSingapore Governments reserved the right to  decide\r\n\r\nin  the final analysis, whether this Clause or  any\r\n\r\nother clauses should be included in the Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>* * *</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Sri Ismail suggested that these final drafts\r\n\r\nshould be transmitted to the respective Governments\r\n\r\nfor consideration. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews  and reactions of both the Governments  would\r\n\r\nbe discussed at the next meeting.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drafts are working drafts, subject to further\r\n\r\nclarification by both sides when any  point  is  in\r\n\r\ndoubt. Nowhere was it stated that the working draft\r\n\r\nis the final draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be interested to hear the I.M.F.'s\r\n\r\nadvice  on  the  negotiations. The  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  I.M.F. mission  in  his  remarks  on   the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of the negotiations  stated  that  as\r\n\r\ntechnicians,  the  two I.M.F. officials  found  the\r\n\r\nBank   Negara's  revised  proposal   as   generally\r\n\r\nworkable and sound. However, it was emphasised that\r\n\r\nthere was the need for the two Governments to  join\r\n\r\nissue  on  fundamental matters  which  have  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved during the course of the negotiations.  He\r\n\r\ndescribed  the I.M.F.'s role as that of  an  honest\r\n\r\nbroker  and at no stage did it make any attempt  to\r\n\r\ngive  policy  advice  to  either  Government.   The\r\n\r\nI.M.F., Sir, never recommended acceptance of the so-called final working draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, what are Singapore's plans\r\n\r\nfor  the  future,  if  no  agreement  on  a  common\r\n\r\ncurrency  can  be reached? I think it is  important\r\n\r\nfor  all of us to understand the present system  on\r\n\r\nwhich  our currency is based. I shall then  explain\r\n\r\nwhy it is vital for Singapore's economy to continue\r\n\r\nwith  the Currency Board arrangements with 100  per\r\n\r\ncent backing in foreign exchange reserves for every\r\n\r\ndollar we issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present currency system is based on what is\r\n\r\ncalled  the sterling exchange standard. This  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  holder of a currency note has  a  right,\r\n\r\nguaranteed  under  the  law,  to  exchange  it  for\r\n\r\nequivalent value in sterling. To ensure  that  this\r\n\r\nlegal  right of the currency holder can  always  be\r\n\r\neffectively  met,  the Board  of  Commissioners  of\r\n\r\nCurrency  is required under the law, to maintain  a\r\n\r\n100 per cent backing of the note issue in sterling.\r\n\r\nThis  means  that for every dollar in  circulation,\r\n\r\nthere  is 2s. 4d, worth of assets held by the Crown\r\n\r\nAgents   in  London  on  behalf  of  the   Currency\r\n\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This right of automatic convertibility of the\r\n\r\ndollar into sterling and through sterling to  other\r\n\r\ncurrencies  of the world is important. So  long  as\r\n\r\nsterling (or other overseas) assets are not less in\r\n\r\nvalue  than  the  total value of note  circulation,\r\n\r\nautomatic convertibility is guaranteed both in  law\r\n\r\nand in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has three important consequences on\r\n\r\nthe  economy. First, it allows foreign trade to  be\r\n\r\nconducted    without   exchange    control.    From\r\n\r\nSingapore's  point of view as an  entrepot  trading\r\n\r\ncentre,  the  absence  of exchange  control  is  an\r\n\r\nessential feature of our monetary system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of the automatic sterling\r\n\r\nexchange  standard  is  that  balance  of  payments\r\n\r\nequilibrium  is  achieved  through  variations   in\r\n\r\nincomes.  For instance, if imports for  consumption\r\n\r\nexceed earnings from exports and services, this  is\r\n\r\nadjusted automatically by the reduction of  incomes\r\n\r\nworking through the economy and reducing imports in\r\n\r\nsubsequent  periods. As people's incomes  contract,\r\n\r\nthey buy less and with reduced expenditure, imports\r\n\r\nalso go down. Similarly, when earnings from exports\r\n\r\nand  services  exceed imports in any given  period,\r\n\r\nthe  tendency is for increasing incomes to lead  to\r\n\r\nincreasing   expenditure  and  thus  to  increasing\r\n\r\nimports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that, apart from overseas\r\n\r\nloans  and grants, the Government must balance  its\r\n\r\nbudget,  both its recurrent and capital development\r\n\r\nprojects.  Total  Government  expenditure  must  be\r\n\r\nbalanced  by Government revenue and borrowing  from\r\n\r\nthe  public.  Where the Government  has  set  aside\r\n\r\nreserves,  say, in the Development or other  Funds,\r\n\r\nthese  reserves  can be run down but  in  the  long\r\n\r\nterm, income must balance expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not always the case in other countries.\r\n\r\nLeaving   aside  loans  and  grants  from  overseas\r\n\r\ncountries,  governments can borrow from  their  own\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank. This is a euphemism for printing  of\r\n\r\ncurrency notes by the Central Bank and handing them\r\n\r\nover  to the government to spend. Such Central Bank\r\n\r\nloans   to  the  government  are  sometimes  called\r\n\r\n\"credit creation\". It is the result\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  deficit financing, i.e., when government spends\r\n\r\nmore  than what it can collect in the form of taxes\r\n\r\nor  borrow from the money market. \"Credit creation\"\r\n\r\nin  this  sense  usually leads  to  more  money  in\r\n\r\ncirculation  chasing the same amount of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices leading to rising prices or inflation.  In\r\n\r\nits  acute  form,  it leads to a  collapse  of  the\r\n\r\nexchange   currency,  as  has  happened   in   some\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial result of government borrowing from\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Bank  (printing  new  currency  notes\r\n\r\nagainst  loan  scripts  signed  by  a  government's\r\n\r\nfinance minister) is that the money income  of  the\r\n\r\nnation is increased by the amount of the additional\r\n\r\nnotes.  As  people  spend this  additional  income,\r\n\r\nprices  begin  to  rise. Where part  of  the  money\r\n\r\nincome  is  spent on imports, then  there  will  be\r\n\r\npressure   on   the   country's  foreign   exchange\r\n\r\nreserves.  For  unless exports keep pace  with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in imports, the foreign exchange reserves\r\n\r\nwill   fall,   if   expenditure  on   imports   for\r\n\r\nconsumption  continues  to  exceed  earnings   from\r\n\r\nexports, it will be necessary for the government to\r\n\r\nration the use of foreign exchange. The holder of a\r\n\r\ncurrency  note  then loses his right  to  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion  on  demand  into foreign  currency.  He\r\n\r\napplies  for  permission to buy foreign currencies.\r\n\r\nThis is known as \"exchange control\". Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, exchange control has had  to  be\r\n\r\nimposed in almost all the under-developed countries\r\n\r\nwhich  have  emerged into independence since  World\r\n\r\nWar II and which have established their own Central\r\n\r\nBanks.  For  our trading economy it  is  imperative\r\n\r\nthat  our  money must remain convertible to  enable\r\n\r\nour traders to import almost anything from anywhere\r\n\r\neither for resale or for our own consumption. There\r\n\r\nis  no  rationing  of foreign exchange.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nthis  makes  trading much easier and  is  of  great\r\n\r\nadvantage to our entrepot economy. We must continue\r\n\r\nthis practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this system\r\n\r\nwas established by the colonial administration. The\r\n\r\nCurrency  Board system is not necessarily defective\r\n\r\njust because a colonial administration used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit. Many newly independent countries have gone  on\r\n\r\nto  the central banking system because the Currency\r\n\r\nBoard  system  prevented them from  spending  money\r\n\r\nthey  were not earning, as no notes could be issued\r\n\r\nwithout 100 per cent backing in reserves. In  fact,\r\n\r\nif  we  look  at  the  matter dispassionately,  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Board system has contributed substantially\r\n\r\nto  the  financial stability of the present dollar.\r\n\r\nUnder  the Currency Board system it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  a country to spend a dollar more than it earns\r\n\r\nabroad.  As  a trading community, Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to have a currency that is less than  this.\r\n\r\nIf  our  word  is to be as good as our  bond,  then\r\n\r\nSingapore's  currency must always remain  a  freely\r\n\r\nconvertible  one,  that is  a  hard  currency.  We,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  propose to continue with  the  Currency\r\n\r\nBoard system. In other words, Sir, the new currency\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore will issue from June next year will\r\n\r\nat  all  times be backed 100 per cent  by  gold  or\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  assets, and  will  remain  fully\r\n\r\nconvertible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will begin its currency board issue on\r\n\r\na  sound  financial basis. Compared to the  end  of\r\n\r\n1965,   official  reserves,  not  counting  foreign\r\n\r\nassets  held  by commercial banks and  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  stand at over $1,021 million. This  is  10\r\n\r\nper  cent  above the level of official reserves  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  last  year. This amount  of  official\r\n\r\nreserves  is  adequate to finance retained  imports\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore for 10 months. This liquid position\r\n\r\ncompares  favourably with the most solvent  nations\r\n\r\nof  the  world.  Another  strong  feature  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's external debt position at the level  of\r\n\r\nonly $58 million is one of the lowest in the world.\r\n\r\nThis  amount of external debt represents  only  0.5\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  current account earnings  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term outlook is equally sound. Soon\r\n\r\nafter  the  separation of Singapore from  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank  sent  a  mission  to  assess  the\r\n\r\neconomic  and  financial position of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nthe  estimation  of  the World  Bank,  the  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange gap over the next five years until 1970\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  amount to only $350 million. This gap can  be\r\n\r\neasily met. Prospects are good that the Bank itself\r\n\r\nwill  be prepared to lend Singapore about one-third\r\n\r\nof  the  foreign exchange requirements.  The  World\r\n\r\nBank has already agreed to lend $45 million to  the\r\n\r\nPort of Singapore Authority. Another one-third  can\r\n\r\nbe  made  available  through  bilateral  commercial\r\n\r\ncredits. A loan to finance the construction of  the\r\n\r\nnew Jurong Power Station has been negotiated with a\r\n\r\nJapanese   supplier.   The  remaining   amount   is\r\n\r\ntherefore a relatively minor sum which can  be  met\r\n\r\nby  Singapore itself. But even if Singapore borrows\r\n\r\nthe  entire shortfall of about $350 million in  the\r\n\r\nnext  five years to finance a development programme\r\n\r\nestimated  at  $1,750 million,  the  external  debt\r\n\r\nservice  will amount to only slightly more  than  2\r\n\r\nper  cent of estimated current account earnings  in\r\n\r\n1970, the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years domestic exports have been\r\n\r\nrising.  For  the annual period ending  June  1966,\r\n\r\ndomestic exports amounted to $1,090 million, or  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  24 per cent over the same  period  in\r\n\r\n1965.  The volume of trade for the 12 months ending\r\n\r\nJune  1966  showed an increase of $569 million,  or\r\n\r\njust  over 9 per cent over the corresponding period\r\n\r\nof  the  previous  year. Bank loans  and  advances,\r\n\r\nalways  good economic indicators, rose from  $1,011\r\n\r\nmillion  at  the end of June last year  to  $1,054\r\n\r\nmillion at the end of June this year, reflecting an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  4.3  per cent. Revenue  from  liquor,\r\n\r\ntobacco and petroleum, the major sources of  public\r\n\r\nfinance,  have  also increased by about  12.24  per\r\n\r\ncent this year. Finally, Singapore's gross domestic\r\n\r\nproduct  in  1965  is estimated at $3,023  million,\r\n\r\nwhich is an increase of $213 million, or 8 per cent\r\n\r\nover the 1964 output. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, means\r\n\r\nthat  the per capital national income of Singapore,\r\n\r\nafter  stagnating in 1964, is again  on  an  upward\r\n\r\ntrend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indicators reflect an expanding economy at\r\n\r\na  good rate of growth which can be maintained  and\r\n\r\neven accelerated, given international confidence in\r\n\r\nour  currency and economy, prudent use of resources\r\n\r\nand hard work on our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration, the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided to continue with a currency board which can\r\n\r\nissue notes only with full 100 per cent backing  in\r\n\r\nreserves.  We have decided to abjure  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncomforts  of  Central Banking finance which  offers\r\n\r\nflexibility  and  temporary  relief  for  financial\r\n\r\nstringency   but  which  often  leads  to   chronic\r\n\r\nmonetary difficulties. No developing country has as\r\n\r\nyet demonstrated that it can successfully engage in\r\n\r\nCentral    Bank    credit   creation.    Calamitous\r\n\r\nconsequences  have  invariably  followed   when   a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  country indulges in borrowing  currency\r\n\r\nnotes  printed by its Central Bank. For  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhose  economy  is  open and faces  competition  at\r\n\r\nevery  point from the rest of the world,  the  most\r\n\r\nrigorous  monetary policies have  to  be  followed.\r\n\r\nThis  calls  for the tightest economic  and  social\r\n\r\ndiscipline  from the people of Singapore.  The  100\r\n\r\nper  cent  backed currency system that we  will  be\r\n\r\noperating means that if Singapore wishes  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore, then we must first earn more. Productivity of\r\n\r\nlabour,  efficiency of management and the  strength\r\n\r\nof   our   economic  infrastructure  have   to   be\r\n\r\nmaintained and improved continuously. There  is  no\r\n\r\nalternative for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the luxury of maintaining\r\n\r\ntemporary full employment in an election year, with\r\n\r\nwhich   some   governments  have   pampered   their\r\n\r\npopulation by following inflationary policies,  low\r\n\r\ninterest rates and easy credits in order to  expand\r\n\r\nconsumption  and expand employment and  temporarily\r\n\r\nexpand  imports at the risk of running  down  their\r\n\r\nforeign exchange reserves, is not one which will be\r\n\r\nopen  to  the Singapore Government. Whether  it  is\r\n\r\nelection  year, or any other year, if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfall  in  the dollars we earn either by  production\r\n\r\nand sale of our goods and services, or by brokerage\r\n\r\non  trade,  then  the  amount of  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nearned  will  immediately go down,  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  available for expenditure will also go down,\r\n\r\ndemands  on  goods and services will  go  down  and\r\n\r\nunemployment must go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rigorous regime but we must accept this\r\n\r\naustere   and   severe  system  of  adjusting   our\r\n\r\nconsumption to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearnings at all times if we are to maintain our pre-eminence  as a great trading centre.

But\r\n\r\nwhether it will be much more than this will  depend\r\n\r\nupon  the  redemption of the old currency when  the\r\n\r\nnew currency comes out.

The  two\r\n\r\nofficials had met and had worked out different ways\r\n\r\nin which each country can have control over its own\r\n\r\nreserves. The disagreement is over the question  of\r\n\r\nownership of the reserves. The crux of the  problem\r\n\r\nis  the suggestion made by Bank Negara Malaysia  as\r\n\r\nto  how we can transfer our property to Bank Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in Singapore, since Bank Negara  Malaysia\r\n\r\nin Singapore has no legal entity. At the same time,\r\n\r\nit  also  suggested that the value of the  property\r\n\r\ncould  be  credited to the account of  Bank  Negara\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  Singapore,  while  the  title  should\r\n\r\nremain with Bank Negara Malaysia, and we were asked\r\n\r\nto  transfer  ownership of all our assets  to  Bank\r\n\r\nNegara  Malaysia.

Can the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance assure the House of the value  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   dollar  since  Singapore  has   limited\r\n\r\nnatural resources?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I say that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are always out to do a disservice\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  us but to the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHence  this  white lie which they  put  up  -  that\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore has got no natural resources, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar will be weaker than the Malaysian\r\n\r\ndollar.  That  is utter rot and utter nonsense.  We\r\n\r\nhave   seen   many  countries  with  rich   natural\r\n\r\nresources.  But what happens to their currency?  It\r\n\r\nis  just  like \"banana notes\" - I need not  mention\r\n\r\nthe country. But here we are going on a hundred per\r\n\r\ncent  backed  currency which means that  no  matter\r\n\r\nwhat happens, even if we are burnt down,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  we  are  looted and all that,  our  assets  are\r\n\r\noutside.

If\r\n\r\nyou  have a backing of $100 million, and you  print\r\n\r\n$1,000  million, then obviously the  value  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrency goes down. It is a simple thing, like  the\r\n\r\nrunning  of  a  household. If you are earning  less\r\n\r\nthan  what you spend, then, of course, you get into\r\n\r\ndifficulties. As for Singapore, we will never allow\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister of Singapore to take the easy\r\n\r\nway  out;  that is, whenever he cannot balance  his\r\n\r\nbudget,  he goes to the Central Bank and  says,  \"I\r\n\r\ngive  you  an  I.O.U.,\" and the Central  Bank  just\r\n\r\nchurns out notes! No, I do not think that is a good\r\n\r\nway. And we have seen many new developing countries\r\n\r\nwhere  that is done. It is a very simple  thing  to\r\n\r\ndo.  It  becomes  habit forming and,  in  the  end,\r\n\r\nnothing  is  left. You will have notes  which  cost\r\n\r\nmore  than what it costs to print. We are not going\r\n\r\nin for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement  just now. I would like  to  ask  him  to\r\n\r\nclarify  a  step further in order to enable  us  to\r\n\r\nknow  when  or whether we can have our own  Central\r\n\r\nBank,  like that of Malaysia, so that it can  issue\r\n\r\nits  own currency and need not have to depend on  a\r\n\r\nCurrency Board created under a colonial regime,  as\r\n\r\nin  the  past. I would also like to ask him whether\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary for us to have a Central Bank  to\r\n\r\nissue  currency and, at the same time, to  preserve\r\n\r\nthe  value  of our currency against any fluctuation\r\n\r\nor other influences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no\r\n\r\nreason why we should have one. Our feeling is this:\r\n\r\nlooking around us we have seen that Central Banking\r\n\r\nfinancing in developing countries is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprelude   to  an  easy  way  out  of  a   difficult\r\n\r\nsituation,  and  it has led to disaster.  One  must\r\n\r\nfirst  understand what is the objective of  setting\r\n\r\nup  a  Central Bank; whether it is for prestige  so\r\n\r\nthat you can go to an international conference  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Look, I have got a Central Bank and this  is\r\n\r\nthe Governor of my Central Bank.\" Or do you want it\r\n\r\nto  serve a useful purpose? A Central Bank, as  far\r\n\r\nas  I understand it, can only be effective if there\r\n\r\nis  what  you call a highly developed money market.\r\n\r\nAnd  I,  for  one,  feel that  in  most  developing\r\n\r\ncountries  there  is not a highly  developed  money\r\n\r\nmarket;  there  is  an absence of  a  money  market\r\n\r\nentirely. Central Banks are set up, first, probably\r\n\r\nfor prestige, and second, for the flexibility which\r\n\r\nallows Finance Ministers to juggle with expenditure\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  engaged in deficit  financing.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  where we really have to work  hard  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  ourselves, we must not be put  to  this\r\n\r\ntemptation - for me or any future Finance Minister.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as far as we are concerned, I think  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of banking and the control of watching over\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange can be supervised by other  means\r\n\r\nthan  a  Central  Bank. One of the  most  important\r\n\r\nfunctions  of a Central Bank in a highly  developed\r\n\r\ncountry  is  to  influence  the  amount  of   money\r\n\r\navailable   through  what  we  call   open   market\r\n\r\noperations. In most of the developing countries, it\r\n\r\nis  not possible to do that simply because there is\r\n\r\nno  money market. So for our purpose I do not think\r\n\r\nit  would  be  advisable to set up a Central  Bank.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  that  is  our thought at  the  moment  and\r\n\r\nunless and until some -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is a final thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The Prime Minister, having\r\n\r\nlistened to what a Finance Minister could  do  with\r\n\r\nthe flexibility of a Central Bank, has put his foot\r\n\r\ndown and says, \"This is our final resolve.

In  the interests of the nation,  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary that the  minority  who  cause\r\n\r\ndamage should be dealt with severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill are simple and\r\n\r\nstraightforward.  Clause  2  of  the  Bill  defines\r\n\r\n\"private property\", \"public property\", and \"act  of\r\n\r\nvandalism\". An act of vandalism includes  stealing,\r\n\r\ndestroying or damaging any public property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides that not only a person who\r\n\r\ncommits  the  act  of vandalism but  also  one  who\r\n\r\nattempts  or  causes any such act to  be  committed\r\n\r\nshall  be  guilty of the offence. Persons  who  are\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  the offence of vandalism  shall,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  fine or imprisonment,  be  liable  to\r\n\r\ncaning.  Sir,  during the Committee  stage  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  I shall introduce amendments for increasing\r\n\r\nthe  penalty  of  fine  and  imprisonment  and  for\r\n\r\nspecifying  the  minimum  and  maximum  number   of\r\n\r\nstrokes  of the cane. Exemption from the punishment\r\n\r\nof  caning is granted to all women and men who  are\r\n\r\nmore  than 50 years of age and those who have  been\r\n\r\nsentenced to death. Clause 3 also provides that the\r\n\r\npunishment of caning shall not be imposed on  first\r\n\r\nconviction  in  the  case of an  act  of  vandalism\r\n\r\ninvolving writing, drawing, painting, etc, with  a\r\n\r\ndelible  substance such as crayon, chalk or  pencil\r\n\r\nand  not with an indelible substance such as  paint\r\n\r\nor tar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that the written authority or\r\n\r\nthe written consent as the case may be required for\r\n\r\na  person to put up posters, etc, shall be produced\r\n\r\non  demand to any member of the Police, the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary, the Auxiliary Police or any member of\r\n\r\nthe Naval, Military or Air Force of Singapore or of\r\n\r\nthose  lawfully present in Singapore. A person  who\r\n\r\nfails,  refuses or neglects to produce such written\r\n\r\nauthority  shall  be guilty of an  offence  and  is\r\n\r\nliable to a fine not exceeding $500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the seizure of posters,\r\n\r\nplacards, bunting, etc, to serve as exhibits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 the offence is made seizable and non-bailable. This means that any person may arrest one\r\n\r\nwho  engages  in an act of vandalism and  hand  him\r\n\r\nover to the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of the Bill is the fact that\r\n\r\nnot  only  the  person or persons who  actually  do\r\n\r\nthese  acts  will be punished but  also  those  who\r\n\r\ncause  such acts to be done. It is common knowledge\r\n\r\nto Members that anti-national elements use children\r\n\r\nand other young persons to smear and mar public and\r\n\r\nprivate  property. These young people  may  not  be\r\n\r\nexpected to understand their acts and they could be\r\n\r\ndisciplined  by  their elders giving  them  a  good\r\n\r\nspanking.  However, the person actually responsible\r\n\r\nfor  these acts has hitherto got away with it. This\r\n\r\nBill now gives the power to use the rod effectively\r\n\r\non  those  who  are  really  behind  such  acts  of\r\n\r\nvandalism.   Indeed  the  punishment  which   would\r\n\r\nnormally be meted out to children can now be  meted\r\n\r\nout  to  the adult delinquents actually responsible\r\n\r\nfor wanton acts of vandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state at this stage that two new\r\n\r\nclauses to the Bill will be proposed by me  at  the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage of the House. I shall give  reasons\r\n\r\nfor these new clauses at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons for the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this Bill  are  quite  clear  and\r\n\r\nanyone  who loves his country and who loves to  see\r\n\r\nit  clean and tidy will not oppose this Bill  which\r\n\r\nis  to  provide exemplary punishment  for  acts  of\r\n\r\nvandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nHouse will accept the reasons given by the Minister\r\n\r\nof   State   of   Defence  for  the  necessity   of\r\n\r\nintroducing this Bill. However, looking at the Bill\r\n\r\nas  a  whole and especially at the amendments  that\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  is  going  to  introduce  for   the\r\n\r\npunishment of acts of vandalism as defined  in  the\r\n\r\nBill, I have the impression that the Government  is\r\n\r\ntaking  the view that severity of punishment  is  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent. Mr Speaker, Sir, severity of punishment\r\n\r\nmay  not, in fact, necessarily be a deterrent.  The\r\n\r\nway to deter any crime, I submit, is to impress  on\r\n\r\nthe wrong-doer the certainty of his being found out\r\n\r\nif he commits one. Also I have the impression  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  as  far as acts  of  vandalism  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  that  is, excluding  the  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements,  this  Bill  could  only  be  an  interim\r\n\r\nmeasure, because, as I see it, vandalism cannot  be\r\n\r\nrooted out by the introduction of a Bill with  very\r\n\r\nsevere  punishment. It can only be  rooted  out  by\r\n\r\neducating our young to respect public property  and\r\n\r\nto  have  a  sense of pride in the public amenities\r\n\r\nprovided  by  society.  Also  there  appear  to  be\r\n\r\ncertain inconsistencies in the law if this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  and  I  wonder whether the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider  amending  the  law regarding  punishment.\r\n\r\nHere  in this Bill it says that an act of vandalism\r\n\r\n- if the amendments go through - is punishable by a\r\n\r\nfine of not exceeding $2,000, or imprisonment of  a\r\n\r\nterm  not exceeding three years, and also mandatory\r\n\r\ncaning  except  in certain circumstances.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Minor Offences Ordinance, section 11 of  which\r\n\r\nhas not been -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, if you are addressing\r\n\r\nyourself to specific provisions as you are  now,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Committee stage would be the  more\r\n\r\nappropriate  place to address your  remarks.  Could\r\n\r\nyou  try to speak now on the broad policies of  the\r\n\r\nBill rather than on narrow specific details?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. But these\r\n\r\nspecific details, in fact, concern the broad policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill,  because it does mean that,  broadly\r\n\r\nspeaking, the punishment provided in this Bill,  as\r\n\r\nI  view  it,  is  far too severe  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting   provisions   of   the   Minor   Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  section 11 (1) of which  has  not  been\r\n\r\namended. May I, Mr Speaker, quote from section 11?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`11 - (1) Any person who commits any of the\r\n\r\nfollowing  offences shall be liable to a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding fifty dollars:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) without authority in the case of public\r\n\r\nproperty, or without the consent of the  owner\r\n\r\nor  occupier in the case of private  property,\r\n\r\naffixes   or   causes  to   be   affixed   any\r\n\r\nadvertisement, bill or notice,  or  any  paper\r\n\r\nagainst  or upon any building, wall or  fence,\r\n\r\nor  writes  upon, defaces or  marks  any  such\r\n\r\nbuilding, wall or fence with chalk or paint or\r\n\r\nin any other way;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This person would then be punished with only a fine\r\n\r\non conviction of $50. Whereas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  the law-enforcing authorities should charge the\r\n\r\nsame person for the same offence under the new  Act\r\n\r\nto  be passed, he would be punished with a fine  of\r\n\r\nnot less than $2,000 or imprisonment of three years\r\n\r\nwith  mandatory caning. I am just bringing up these\r\n\r\nprovisions for the consideration of the Government.\r\n\r\nPossibly  the Government may wish to amend  section\r\n\r\n11  (1)  of the Minor Offences Ordinance so  as  to\r\n\r\nbring  it  into line with the policy  of  deterrent\r\n\r\nagainst offenders who commit acts of vandalism.  As\r\n\r\nI  said,  Mr Speaker, on the whole, we  appreciate\r\n\r\nthe reasons for the introduction of this Bill and I\r\n\r\non balance support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.38p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to explain to the House what we are seeking to\r\n\r\ndo  by  making this departure from what  is  normal\r\n\r\ncriminal  law legislation. One of the  problems  we\r\n\r\nface    in   running   the   British   system    of\r\n\r\nadministration of justice is that the law is  often\r\n\r\nbeing  administered, particularly in recent  years,\r\n\r\nby  legally trained magistrates who do not have the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the wider background of the  problems\r\n\r\nof  the  society and of administering that society.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  that  by  the time the  offender  of  a\r\n\r\nparticularly  vicious  social  misdemeanour,   like\r\n\r\ntaking a pot of paint and going to every bus  stand\r\n\r\nand  chalking  up anti-American or anti-British  or\r\n\r\npro-Vietcong slogans, is apprehended and brought to\r\n\r\ncourt,   from  the  vicious  petty  slogan-shouting\r\n\r\nhooligan  that  he is outside, he converts  himself\r\n\r\ninto  a  meek, humble breadwinner of a large family\r\n\r\nwho  was doing no more than just giving vent to his\r\n\r\npolitical  exuberance.  And  he  gets  off  with  a\r\n\r\ncaution and sometimes a light fine. The net  result\r\n\r\nis    that   this   particularly   vicious   social\r\n\r\nmisdemeanour  is not capable of being checked,  let\r\n\r\nalone  stopped. It is difficult enough to apprehend\r\n\r\nthese  offenders. Under the section  in  the  Minor\r\n\r\nOffences  Ordinance which we have to operate,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  non-seizable offence. So if you  are  not  a\r\n\r\npolice officer, or even if you are a member of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps, you will be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  brave man to go and apprehend such a culprit.\r\n\r\nI  do not think it is possible for us to go back to\r\n\r\nthe  old  British  practice where  people  who  are\r\n\r\nadministrators,  having  served  a  term   in   the\r\n\r\nbusiness of running the government, then do a spell\r\n\r\nof  two or more years on the Bench, and so there is\r\n\r\na  constant flow of fairly matter-of-fact gentlemen\r\n\r\nwho  understand  the mechanics of  how  the  system\r\n\r\nworks and know the other side of the coin, not just\r\n\r\nwhat happens in the courtroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes a clear distinction between what\r\n\r\nis  considered  a  lesser offence, something  which\r\n\r\njust  dirties up the wall - which is delible -  and\r\n\r\nwhere  you  deliberately seek to mess up the  place\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time with red paint, which is a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  substance to eradicate, on bus  shelters\r\n\r\nand  public  buildings. Large  sums  of  money  are\r\n\r\nexpended  in  order to remove the  unsightly  scars\r\n\r\nwhich they leave behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the problem has been complicated by the\r\n\r\nease  of  access to public property which,  in  the\r\n\r\nnature  of things, is difficult to prevent.  Thefts\r\n\r\nof  fountain  heads  made of copper,  copper  tubes\r\n\r\noutside Housing and Development Board premises used\r\n\r\nfor  boilers  and other things - and copper  is  in\r\n\r\nshort  supply because of the transportation problem\r\n\r\nof  Rhodesian  and Zambian copper - and  thefts  of\r\n\r\nvaluable  parts  of non-ferrous metals  have  taken\r\n\r\nplace,  to  be sold for a fraction of their  actual\r\n\r\ncost.  I do not think we can allow this to  go  on,\r\n\r\nand  I  know  how strongly the profession  and  the\r\n\r\npenologists  are  against caning.  But  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which, unfortunately, I think, understands\r\n\r\nonly  two things - the incentive and the deterrent.\r\n\r\nWe  intend  to use both, the carrot and the  stick.\r\n\r\nThe  carrot  is good citizenship. It is a  seizable\r\n\r\noffence  to do any of these acts of vandalism,  and\r\n\r\nany  member of the Vigilante Corps, any  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  public, can apprehend. A reward will be  given\r\n\r\nin  order  that these culprits will be  apprehended\r\n\r\nand these crimes will stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a fine will not deter the type\r\n\r\nof  criminal  we  are  facing  here.  He  is  quite\r\n\r\nprepared to go to gaol,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  defaced  public buildings with  red  paint.\r\n\r\nFlaunting the values of his ideology, he  is  quite\r\n\r\nprepared  to  make a martyr of himself  and  go  to\r\n\r\ngaol.  He  will  not  pay  the  fine  and  make   a\r\n\r\ndemonstration of his martyrdom. But if he knows  he\r\n\r\nis  going to get three of the best, I think he will\r\n\r\nlose  a great deal of enthusiasm, because there  is\r\n\r\nlittle  glory  attached to the  rather  humiliating\r\n\r\nexperience of having to be caned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I am\r\n\r\nquite sure that this is going to solve our problem,\r\n\r\nbut  I am convinced that if we are not prepared  to\r\n\r\ninnovate,  if  we are just to stick to  old  formal\r\n\r\nchannels  of legislation or old forms and modes  of\r\n\r\nsocial  control,  then these are  areas  of  public\r\n\r\nbehaviour  over which society will have no  control\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  I hope that there will  never  be  any\r\n\r\ncause,  once these provisions are known,  for  them\r\n\r\never to be invoked. But I feel reasonably confident\r\n\r\nthat  if the offenders are apprehended - as I think\r\n\r\nthey   can   be  apprehended;  these  are  seizable\r\n\r\noffences  and  there  are  enough  people  in   the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps and public-spirited members of  the\r\n\r\nordinary public - and an example is made of a  few,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will not have the discomfiture of finding\r\n\r\nthe electric power supply failing, because somebody\r\n\r\nrisks blowing up a whole transformer substation for\r\n\r\na  few  dollars' worth of public property which  is\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently guarded. If this is understood  -\r\n\r\nand they have a tendency to understand very quickly\r\n\r\nonce  the  word gets around -I am quite  sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a healthier respect for  community\r\n\r\nproperty. This happens all over the world.  But  in\r\n\r\nevery society, values are different, and ours is  a\r\n\r\nnew and young one. We could take the other point of\r\n\r\nview - the Government could be purely negative  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well, in that case, we should not have  this\r\n\r\ncommunity  property. We should not have  fountains.\r\n\r\nWe  should not have these parks. We should not have\r\n\r\nthese  amenities,  because they are  likely  to  be\r\n\r\ndestroyed, mutilated and losses will be  heavy.\"  I\r\n\r\nthink that is a defeatist attitude. By and large, I\r\n\r\nwould say that the majority of the people are  law-\r\n\r\nabiding and respect community property, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand if we can check the misbehaviour of this\r\n\r\nminority,  then  we can move into wider  fields  of\r\n\r\npublic  amenities  with  greater  confidence  that,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the  expenditure will not be  wasted,  and,\r\n\r\nsecond,  the maintenance will be what the  planners\r\n\r\nestimate it to be and not what we subsequently find\r\n\r\nourselves carrying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope eventually that the remarks I have made\r\n\r\nhere in this House will also be heeded not only  by\r\n\r\nthe offenders but also by those who participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  administration of justice. I  have  a  feeling\r\n\r\nthat often in the younger ranks of the service, the\r\n\r\nadministration  of justice is believed  to  be  the\r\n\r\napplication of the law. It is because they  believe\r\n\r\nthat, that we are forced to take these measures.  I\r\n\r\nthink  a wider grasp that administration of justice\r\n\r\nmeans  the application of the letter of the law  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  spirit  that society is  able  to  protect\r\n\r\nitself, is fundamental. If we are able to implement\r\n\r\nthese  provisions with efficacy in  the  first  few\r\n\r\nmonths,  I am quite sure that this will be  a  dead\r\n\r\nletter in our statute book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill  have observed that this Bill seeks to provide\r\n\r\nexemplary punishment for acts of vandalism and that\r\n\r\nsuch punishment is to include caning which is to be\r\n\r\nmade mandatory on conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, it must be conceded that present-day penological trends are against the infliction\r\n\r\nof caning as a punishment and that legal opinion is\r\n\r\nin  general  against  the  imposition  of  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment  in  cases  not  involving  violence  or\r\n\r\nbrutality.    We   are,   however,   unfortunately,\r\n\r\nconfronted  with a situation which has  to  be  met\r\n\r\nwith  boldly  and must take effective  measures  to\r\n\r\ncurb,  indeed  eradicate, completely  irresponsible\r\n\r\nacts  of  hooliganism. Parts of fountains built  at\r\n\r\nconsiderable expense to beautify the city have been\r\n\r\ndestroyed  or stolen, thus completely or  partially\r\n\r\nimmobilising them and making it necessary  to  post\r\n\r\npolicemen in the vicinity of fountains. Yet  others\r\n\r\nsteal  vital  parts from electric switch-boxes  and\r\n\r\nsubstations, supremely indifferent to the attendant\r\n\r\nrisk of fire and loss of life and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty. Other acts of vandalism include  painting\r\n\r\nslogans  on bus shelters, telephone booths, bridges\r\n\r\nand  walls, affixing posters and banners on  public\r\n\r\nand   private   property,  thus   defacing   public\r\n\r\nproperty.  Apart from defacement of such  property,\r\n\r\nsuch  slogans often are not of a nature  calculated\r\n\r\nto  keep the peace. There are yet others who scrawl\r\n\r\non  walls  or deface or destroy property for  sheer\r\n\r\ndevilment or mischief. However, Members will, I  am\r\n\r\nsure, agree that it is imperative to make provision\r\n\r\nin the law for deterrent punishment which this Bill\r\n\r\nnow before the House seeks to do. I need hardly say\r\n\r\nthat  the  existing  punishment provided  for  such\r\n\r\noffences  is, as the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  has\r\n\r\npointed out, a fine not exceeding $50, and  has  in\r\n\r\nthe  present context proved to be wholly inadequate\r\n\r\nas a deterrent measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides that where any person steals,\r\n\r\ndestroys or damages any public property, or without\r\n\r\nthe written consent of the owner or occupier in the\r\n\r\ncase   of   private  property  or  without  written\r\n\r\nauthority in the case of public property, paints or\r\n\r\nmarks  any  public or private property, or  affixes\r\n\r\nany poster or placard or any bunting or banner with\r\n\r\nany  slogan or caricature on, in or from  any  such\r\n\r\nproperty, or attempts to do the same or causes  the\r\n\r\nsame to be damaged, he is to be caned on conviction\r\n\r\nin addition to being fined or imprisoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to move amendments to the Bill in\r\n\r\nCommittee whereby the number of strokes insofar  as\r\n\r\ncaning  is  concerned is to be  specified  and  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of imprisonment increased. But we will  say\r\n\r\nmore  about  that in Committee. The  punishment  of\r\n\r\ncaning  has  been  introduced advisedly  and  after\r\n\r\nconsiderable thought. It has been found in practice\r\n\r\nthat  while  many  convicted  persons  will  accept\r\n\r\nwithout  demur  a  heavy fine  or  even  a  lengthy\r\n\r\nsentence  of imprisonment, they tend to  view  with\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  alarm and despondency  any  sentence\r\n\r\nwhich  requires the infliction of caning. This  is,\r\n\r\nof  course, typical of the mentality of  the  bully\r\n\r\nand   the  coward  and  of  those  who  choose   to\r\n\r\nperpetrate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  offences under cover of darkness, which  is,\r\n\r\nin fact, the case with the majority of acts of this\r\n\r\nsort.  Caning  has accordingly been made  mandatory\r\n\r\nupon conviction and the Court is required to impose\r\n\r\nsuch  a sentence, though their acceptance prohibits\r\n\r\nthe   infliction  of  corporal  punishment   on   a\r\n\r\nteenager,   and  the  Court  is  given  a   further\r\n\r\ndiscretion not to impose corporal punishment  where\r\n\r\nthe  prisoner is more than 50 years of  age.  These\r\n\r\nprohibitions have been inserted in order  that  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  rules governing the infliction of corporal\r\n\r\npunishment   now  to  be  found  in  the   Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code are not contradictory. Caning  will\r\n\r\nalso not be imposed on a first conviction where the\r\n\r\nact  of vandalism comprises drawing or marking with\r\n\r\npen,   pencil,  crayon,  chalk  or  other   delible\r\n\r\nsubstance but not with an indelible substance  such\r\n\r\nas paint. Neither will a person be caned on a first\r\n\r\nconviction  for affixing or displaying  posters  or\r\n\r\nhanging  or suspending banners as it would only  be\r\n\r\nfair  to  equate  both  these  offences  with   the\r\n\r\npunishment for delible writing since posters can be\r\n\r\ntorn off easily enough and banners taken down.  All\r\n\r\nthese  detailed provisions are deemed necessary  in\r\n\r\norder  that  this  new legislation may  effectively\r\n\r\nachieve its object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the amendments to the Bill which it is\r\n\r\nproposed  to move in Committee are the introduction\r\n\r\nof   two   important  clauses:  one   relating   to\r\n\r\npresumptions in the law of evidence and  the  other\r\n\r\nto  second-hand  dealers who receive  stolen  State\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by a two-pronged move, one,\r\n\r\ndealing as severely as possible with the malefactor\r\n\r\nwho  is  the  actual  perpetrator  of  the  act  of\r\n\r\nvandalism and, secondly, by cutting off his  avenue\r\n\r\nfor  the  sale  of  such property  as  well  as  by\r\n\r\ncancelling  the  licences  of  second-hand  dealers\r\n\r\nconvicted  of  receiving such stolen  property,  we\r\n\r\nhope  to remove this blot on the fair name  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Attracted  by\r\n\r\nSingapore's   excellent  distribution   facilities,\r\n\r\ncommercial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconnections  and  other ancillary  services,  these\r\n\r\ncountries  are  expected to  utilise  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for selling their goods in this  part  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A free trade zone for Singapore to replace her\r\n\r\nfree  port  status was recommended by a World  Bank\r\n\r\nMission in July 1963, when the Telok Ayer Basin was\r\n\r\nsuggested as the site for entrepot goods discharged\r\n\r\nby  lighter and other small craft. During Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  site  was initially developed and  legislation\r\n\r\ndrafted so as to declare the Basin and the port for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of establishing the first  free  trade\r\n\r\nzone in Singapore. In the zone trading and entrepot\r\n\r\nactivities  would  be entirely  free  from  customs\r\n\r\ncontrol. Upon separation, the draft legislation was\r\n\r\nrevised  yet  again to suit the changed  short-term\r\n\r\nconditions,  but not to lose sight of  the  longer-term interests of this region as a whole. The views\r\n\r\nof   representatives  of  the  four   Chambers   of\r\n\r\nCommerce,  as  well as the Singapore Manufacturer's\r\n\r\nAssociation,    on    the   desirable    permissive\r\n\r\nlegislation  for  the establishment  of  such  free\r\n\r\ntrade zones have been solicited during the drafting\r\n\r\nof    the   permissive   legislation   now   before\r\n\r\nParliament, and it is considered that for the large\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade of Singapore, specially  designated\r\n\r\nfree trade zones in addition to licensed and bonded\r\n\r\nwarehouses  with  drawback facilities  provide  the\r\n\r\nbest solution. From within such zones, the entrepot\r\n\r\nand  transit  trades can be conducted  without  the\r\n\r\npayment of any tariffs and with the minimal customs\r\n\r\ncontrol.   In  the  principal  customs   territory,\r\n\r\nadditional  Government licensed factory  warehouses\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to be utilised for the  storage  of\r\n\r\ndutiable goods, particularly high-duty goods as  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the contents of the Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nto elaborate on the more salient clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 allows for the designation of any\r\n\r\nareas in Singapore as free trade zones and for  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the authority  to  administer  and\r\n\r\noperate such zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 defines the operations which will be\r\n\r\npermitted within a free trade zone.

Provision  is  also   made   for   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of duty-free shops to operate  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  outside  any free trade zone, and  for  their\r\n\r\nregulation and control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the more important clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill changes the definitions\r\n\r\nof  \"dutiable goods\", \"export\", \"import\",  \"goods\",\r\n\r\n\"value\"   and  introduces  three  new  definitions:\r\n\r\n\"customs   territory\",  \"free   trade   zone\"   and\r\n\r\n\"tourist\",  to accord with the replacement  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  free  port status by a principal  customs\r\n\r\nterritory and a free trade zone or zones.  \"import\"\r\n\r\nno   longer  means  the  bringing  of  goods   into\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  into \"customs territory\"  from  any\r\n\r\nplace outside, including any free trade zone. Goods\r\n\r\ngenuinely in transit are not included as such goods\r\n\r\nwill  be  within  any free trade zone  and  outside\r\n\r\ncustoms  control.

The term \"value\" is amended to\r\n\r\nspecify  equitably that customs duties and  charges\r\n\r\nincurred on wharf handling, storage, removal and so\r\n\r\non,  incurred in a free trade zone are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded. To ensure that the sale of dutiable goods\r\n\r\nin  duty-free shops is made to bona fide  tourists,\r\n\r\n\"tourist\"  is defined to mean any person, including\r\n\r\npersons  in transit, whose entry into Singapore  is\r\n\r\ndependent  upon the presentation of a  passport  or\r\n\r\nother  travel document, and whose stay in Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes not exceed six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for customs and\r\n\r\nexcise  duties  to be levied on any goods  imported\r\n\r\ninto  the  \"customs  territory\"  which  refers   to\r\n\r\nSingapore and her territorial waters, but  excludes\r\n\r\nany  free  trade zone.

Firstly,  by\r\n\r\njoining the Asian Development Bank, Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave an additional source of loans open to it.  The\r\n\r\nAsian Development Bank has an authorised capital of\r\n\r\n$1,000  million. Its paid-up capital will be US$100\r\n\r\nmillion  in  the  first year of its operations  and\r\n\r\nthis  amount will rise up to US$500 million by  the\r\n\r\nfifth  year. In addition to its share capital,  the\r\n\r\nBank  can  also  raise loans from  major  financial\r\n\r\nmarkets  to  supplement  its  own  funds  for  loan\r\n\r\noperations.  Also,  if approved  by  the  Board  of\r\n\r\nGovernors of the Bank, the Bank can participate  in\r\n\r\nequity. This may turn out to be a useful source  of\r\n\r\nfunds  for  some  of Singapore's future  industrial\r\n\r\nprojects.  Secondly,  participation  in  the   Bank\r\n\r\nassociates Singapore with other Asian countries  in\r\n\r\nthe field of regional co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 31 signatories to the Asian Development\r\n\r\nBank  Agreement of which 19 are regional  countries\r\n\r\nand 12 are non-regional countries. Subscriptions to\r\n\r\nthe  share capital of the Bank by various countries\r\n\r\nare  in  accordance  with financial  resources  and\r\n\r\ncommitments  of  the  various countries  concerned.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  subscription  to  the  Bank  is   US$5\r\n\r\nmillion,  half of which will be paid in five  equal\r\n\r\nannual  instalments of US$500,000 each.  Each  such\r\n\r\ninstalment  is  divided  equally  into  convertible\r\n\r\ncurrency  and local currency. For each of the  five\r\n\r\nyears, therefore, Singapore will be required to pay\r\n\r\nUS$250,000  in convertible currency and  US$250,000\r\n\r\nin local currency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable Singapore to ratify the Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank Agreement, it is  necessary  that\r\n\r\nappropriate    legislation   be    enacted.    Upon\r\n\r\nratification  of  the  Agreement,  Singapore   will\r\n\r\nbecome one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  original members of the Asian  Development\r\n\r\nBank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation therefore authorises the\r\n\r\nPresident   to  appoint  someone  to  deposit   the\r\n\r\nInstrument  of  Ratification  with  the  Secretary-General of the United Nations. Clause 4 of the Bill\r\n\r\nenables  the  Singapore Government to subscribe  to\r\n\r\nthe  original  authorised capital of the  Bank.  It\r\n\r\nalso  provides that should the Bank in future  find\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to increase its original  authorised\r\n\r\ncapital,  Singapore  is able to  subscribe  towards\r\n\r\nsuch  an  increase provided that such  subscription\r\n\r\ndoes   not   exceed   US$5   million.   Singapore's\r\n\r\nsubscription to the Bank shall be charged,  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance,  to  the  Consolidated  Fund.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment however may raise loans for the purposes\r\n\r\nof  providing  any  sums required  for  making  any\r\n\r\npayments to the Bank. Also, in lieu of payments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  in local currencies, the Government  can\r\n\r\nalso  create  and  issue to the Bank  non-interest-bearing   and   non-negotiable   notes   or   other\r\n\r\nobligations.  The  Bill also seeks  to  give  legal\r\n\r\neffect  to  the provisions of Chapter VIII  of  the\r\n\r\nAgreement  which provides for the granting  to  the\r\n\r\nBank and its officers and employees certain status,\r\n\r\nexemptions  and  privileges. These  privileges  are\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  those  granted to other  international\r\n\r\ninstitutions,   for   example,  the   International\r\n\r\nMonetary  Fund  and  the  International  Bank   for\r\n\r\nReconstruction  and Development of which  Singapore\r\n\r\nis also a member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.14p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Bill.  The reasons  outlined  by  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to join the Asian Development  Bank\r\n\r\nare  cogent enough. By becoming a member, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to take advantage of not  only  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  facilities of the Bank, but  also  other\r\n\r\ntechnical  facilities. Looking  through  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I  see  that clause 9  (1)  provides  for\r\n\r\ncertain provisions of the Agreement of the Bank  to\r\n\r\nhave the force of law in Singapore. And turning  to\r\n\r\nparagraph 2 of Article 56\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  published in the Schedule of the Bill, it would\r\n\r\nappear that employees of the Bank, irrespective  of\r\n\r\ntheir  status,  would  have facilities  offered  to\r\n\r\nthem,  amongst  which facilities is  the  exemption\r\n\r\nfrom  income tax. Now, most countries in the  world\r\n\r\nalways reserve the right to themselves to tax their\r\n\r\nown  nationals  and I see no reason  why  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  be  an exception; that is, I see no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  Singapore should give up the right to tax  its\r\n\r\nnationals simply because they are employees of  the\r\n\r\nBank.  I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Finance will give this House an\r\n\r\nundertaking  that employees of the Bank,  at  least\r\n\r\nthe clerical staff, will not get exemption from the\r\n\r\ntax laws of Singapore.

Singapore ceased to be  part\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  on  the  9th  of  August,  1965.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately, a number of writs of our High  Court\r\n\r\nwere  still  issued in the name  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong instead of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nor,  after  the  21st  day of December,  1965,  the\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Courts have now decided that such writs are\r\n\r\nnull and void as they were issued in the name of  a\r\n\r\nforeign  sovereign.

He\r\n\r\ndealt  at length with the views of the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement on these practices and also touched on the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  work of  a  recurring  nature\r\n\r\nnormally  done by direct employees and those  which\r\n\r\nwere  thought  to  be  more  efficiently  done   by\r\n\r\ncontract  schemes,  for example, building  projects\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. He also drew the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the concern among workers  over  the\r\n\r\nnumber    of    vacancies   in   the    daily-rated\r\n\r\nestablishment which remained unfilled  due  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of this practice of using contract  labour.\r\n\r\nMy  colleague,  the Member for Telok Blangah,  then\r\n\r\nmade it clear to the House that workers led by  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. could not condone this practice and  urged\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take positive steps to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, far from there being any improvement\r\n\r\nin  this situation, what do we find? I am told that\r\n\r\nthis  tendency  is increasing day  by  day  in  all\r\n\r\ndirections.  I  hear that more  and  more  work  in\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments,  which   was   previously\r\n\r\nundertaken   by   directly  recruited   daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers, is being farmed out to contractors. At one\r\n\r\ntime,  we found such work as grass-cutting only  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of contractors but today we notice  the\r\n\r\ntendency  is  spreading to use contract  labour  so\r\n\r\nthat even minor road repairs and similar work of  a\r\n\r\nrecurring   nature   is   being   farmed   out   to\r\n\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can almost anticipate, if the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  is  here, he will come and  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  use contract labour for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nefficiency and also for economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons.  And I also will expect him  to  say  that\r\n\r\nmost   daily-rated  workers,  if   not   all,   are\r\n\r\nmalingerers. He will add that there is  a  definite\r\n\r\nattempt  to  reduce daily output and to  accumulate\r\n\r\nwork  over  the  week, in order that  work  may  be\r\n\r\nobtained on a Sunday, when double pay is paid. I am\r\n\r\nsure the question of triple pay will be highlighted\r\n\r\nas  the evil of the daily-rated system, even though\r\n\r\nvery  few  people realise that there  are  only  11\r\n\r\npublic  holidays  in  a year in  which  daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkmen can enjoy such benefits, and then only when\r\n\r\nthe employer calls them up for work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a representative of a responsible trade\r\n\r\nunion movement, I do not for a moment wish to  deny\r\n\r\nthat, in a work force of ten thousand men, many  of\r\n\r\nwhom are probably earning a subsistence wage, there\r\n\r\nare some malingerers. This is the inevitable result\r\n\r\nthe  world over if labour is underpaid. I will  not\r\n\r\ndeny  either that there may be instances of  output\r\n\r\nbeing  below  expected standards.  However,  I  ask\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House to recognise that only  part\r\n\r\nof  the blame can be laid at the door of labour.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  problem is bound  up  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  supervision; and to the  extent  that\r\n\r\nthese  malpractices occur, I say  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  the failure of management.  Given  the\r\n\r\nright  supervision and the right management, I  can\r\n\r\nsee no reason why malingerers cannot be brought  to\r\n\r\nbook and restrictive practices removed with the co-operation of the workers and their trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point I wish to ask Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  to appreciate is that the large majority  of\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers  in  the  public  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are not engaged in work which is  easily\r\n\r\nmeasurable  in  terms of output. For  example:  how\r\n\r\ndoes  one  decide on the appropriate  output  of  a\r\n\r\ncleansing labourer working in Tanglin area? On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, how can one compare this with the  work\r\n\r\nrequired  in one of the new housing estates,  where\r\n\r\none has to take into account not only the space  to\r\n\r\nbe  cleaned at ground level, but also the number of\r\n\r\nfloors  above, and the number of people who  reside\r\n\r\nthere, all of whom constantly contribute towards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  quantity of litter and refuse that has  to  be\r\n\r\nremoved? What in fact is the measure to be accepted\r\n\r\nin  cases where large numbers of stationary hawkers\r\n\r\nare   involved,  or  where  well-to-do  second-hand\r\n\r\ndealers choose to dump their scrap metal and  other\r\n\r\nrefuse  on  the  roadside? I ask  the  experts  who\r\n\r\nadvise our Ministers to define and make public  the\r\n\r\nnorms  of  cleansing workers in the public  utility\r\n\r\nservices. Sir, I ask Members of this House to  bear\r\n\r\nthese  points  in  mind before  making  general  or\r\n\r\nsweeping  statements  concerning  malingering   and\r\n\r\nrestrictive  practices in the public  services.  My\r\n\r\ncolleagues  from  the  trade  union  movement   are\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the simple solution suggested  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  by  Treasury  and  Health  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials that contract labour should be used is no\r\n\r\nreal  answer.  We  are convinced that  this  is  an\r\n\r\nenormously  complex  problem  for  management   and\r\n\r\nlabour  to  solve  together  and  one  which  calls\r\n\r\nimmediately   for  an  objective   study   of   the\r\n\r\nsupervisory  system of daily-rated  workers  and  a\r\n\r\nsearch for fair and equitable remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already voiced my fear that some\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House will suggest that  contract\r\n\r\nlabour  is the only answer and I would not  be  the\r\n\r\nleast  surprised if someone even went so far as  to\r\n\r\nspell  out some of the glowing virtues of  contract\r\n\r\nlabour. Of late it has become so fashionable to say\r\n\r\nsuch  things  that  hardly any day  passes  without\r\n\r\nsomeone  extolling  the virtue of  contract  labour\r\n\r\nwithout considering its real implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not for a moment deny the fact that\r\n\r\ncontract labour is cheap in a short-sighted sort of\r\n\r\nway.  I  admit  that  all over the  world  contract\r\n\r\nlabour  is cheaper to the employer only than direct\r\n\r\nlabour.  The final cost to the community,  however,\r\n\r\nis  vastly different and vastly greater. What we in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  movement,  who  believe  in  the\r\n\r\ndignity   of   human  labour,  consider  profoundly\r\n\r\nobjectionable in contract labour is the price which\r\n\r\nworkers  pay in such employment. The man who  bears\r\n\r\nthe evil of the system and is called upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  subsidise the real costs is not the  contractor\r\n\r\nbut the labourer, who by force of circumstances  is\r\n\r\nobliged to accept such an employment. To those  who\r\n\r\nchoose to observe the scene around them, I will ask\r\n\r\nthem  to recall for a moment those workmen and even\r\n\r\nyoung girls who can be seen sweating from seven  in\r\n\r\nthe  morning to seven at night every day, in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the existence of the Labour Ordinance. Whatever\r\n\r\nothers may say, it is well known that any complaint\r\n\r\nover  long hours by such contract workers will mean\r\n\r\nthe  end  of even the casual work they now possess.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding    the    Workmen's    Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  we see many such men and  women  taking\r\n\r\nundue  risks without even the barest of safeguards.\r\n\r\nWhen  they suffer illness, which they often do,  on\r\n\r\nwhom  do  they  depend? Of course,  the  Government\r\n\r\noutdoor  clinic is available to them,  not  at  the\r\n\r\nemployer's  expense  but  at  the  Government's.  I\r\n\r\nmention this simply to demonstrate that much of the\r\n\r\nburden that Government shoulders in the case of its\r\n\r\nown  direct  workers, is also borne as a  concealed\r\n\r\nadded  cost  by  society, when contract  labour  is\r\n\r\nemployed.  When  I  think of the  conditions  under\r\n\r\nwhich contract labour toils - and look at the  many\r\n\r\nmodern  buildings, including our own multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nhouses,  in  which we regularly take pride,  I  say\r\n\r\nthey stand out really as monuments to the sweat and\r\n\r\ntoil of contract labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I stress is not merely a figment of my\r\n\r\nimagination.  It is a fact. The evils  of  contract\r\n\r\nlabour  are recognised throughout the world and  no\r\n\r\nless   a   body   than  the  International   Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation, of which Singapore is a  member,  has\r\n\r\ncried   aloud   against  its  evil  practices.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Labour,  who  recently\r\n\r\nattended the I.L.O. General Assembly, must be aware\r\n\r\nof   the   importance  that  is   placed   on   the\r\n\r\ndecasualisation   of  labour   by   the   civilised\r\n\r\ncountries  of  the world. Lest what is  decided  in\r\n\r\nGeneva  be considered remote and inappropriate  for\r\n\r\nour developing society, let us cite an endeavour in\r\n\r\nour  very  midst,  to  show  that  we  are  equally\r\n\r\nconcerned in such matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask Members of this House to recall the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry into contract  labour  which\r\n\r\nthis  Government set up soon after it came to power\r\n\r\nin  1959.  The  Commission vigorously  decried  the\r\n\r\nevils   of   contract  labour  in   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nspecifically   drew  attention  to  the   following\r\n\r\nfeatures emphasising:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the irregularity of employment;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the insecurity of payment of wages and often\r\n\r\nunderpayment   in  relation  to   established\r\n\r\nindustrial wage pattern;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the evasion of benefits under the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the absence of hospital benefits;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the evasion of Provident Fund contributions; and\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the inadequate provision of safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst accidents and hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding this\r\n\r\nindictment, there appears to be a growing  tendency\r\n\r\nin  our  Government departments to utilise contract\r\n\r\nlabour.  I  would cite as examples the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw  and  National Development. Very  unfortunately\r\n\r\nthe  present  Minister is not  the  person  who  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for that, but nevertheless  it  is  now\r\n\r\nhis portfolio. So he has got to carry the baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.W.D. Workshop Section - repairs of rubbish\r\n\r\npails, cleansing carts, welding of nightsoil pails,\r\n\r\nbuckets, refuse bins and repairs of tools  used  by\r\n\r\ndaily-rated workmen - all this work which has  been\r\n\r\nnormally  done  by the daily-rated workers  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing farmed out to the contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance is the Marine Workshop, such as\r\n\r\nthe  building  of seawalls, buoys and signal  light\r\n\r\nposts  in the sea. In the rural sector, the cutting\r\n\r\nof   grass.  All  this  has  been  given   to   the\r\n\r\ncontractors.  Sir, there are so  many  examples  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  using contract labour  to  replace  the\r\n\r\nregular work force, but I do not like to go on  and\r\n\r\non.  But  I  would  ask the Minister  for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational   Development   to   study   the   present\r\n\r\nsituation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nwhich is a grave injustice not only to the existing\r\n\r\norganised  workers but also to those who are  being\r\n\r\nexploited by the contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have felt myself compelled today, Sir, to make\r\n\r\nthese  comments because my colleagues and I in  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. have observed a disquieting and increasing\r\n\r\ntendency  on  the  part  of some  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  suggest that the  solution  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems  today  here in Singapore  is  to  discard\r\n\r\nthose ideals in which we have believed for so  long\r\n\r\nbecause of the compulsions of our new situation. We\r\n\r\nfind  ourselves  the  more  puzzled  because  these\r\n\r\nutterances  in  support of contract labour  are  so\r\n\r\ncompletely at variance with the precepts and ideals\r\n\r\nas  we know them of the Prime Minister. I refer  to\r\n\r\nhis recommendations in the case of the 9,000 daily-rated  workers in the Port of Singapore  Authority,\r\n\r\nwhere  for  many  years  the workers  struggled  to\r\n\r\nremove the contract labour system and its attendant\r\n\r\nmalpractices.  Members of this  House  will  recall\r\n\r\nthat following the decasualisation of labour in the\r\n\r\nPort of Singapore Authority, there continued to  be\r\n\r\nserious allegations of malingering, accumulation of\r\n\r\nwork,  and improper overtime practices. There  were\r\n\r\nalso  allegations  of  other types  of  restrictive\r\n\r\npractices.  One  would  have  expected   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would be tempted to return to  contract\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that the trade union is\r\n\r\njealous of the Port of Singapore Authority workers.\r\n\r\nThey  have  removed  the malpractices  of  contract\r\n\r\nlabour and they still have malpractices of overtime\r\n\r\nand  all  that.  I am not asking the Government  to\r\n\r\nintroduce,  but  I am only quoting as  an  example,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am  afraid  that the  newspapers  might\r\n\r\nmisquote  me  tomorrow and say that the  Secretary-General  of the N.T.U.C. also prefers to  introduce\r\n\r\ncontract   labour  into  the  Port   of   Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.  The hours of work of the  workmen  were\r\n\r\nstreamlined. They introduced a shift system with an\r\n\r\nelement  of  shift allowances. They also introduced\r\n\r\nimproved  incentive  bonuses  in  order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nfaster  working  of  cargoes.  These  are  improved\r\n\r\nmeasures to replace malingering and so on, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  are  not doing  in  their  various\r\n\r\ndepartments. To crown it all, bonuses were paid  on\r\n\r\nthe  instructions  of  the  Prime  Minister  on  an\r\n\r\ninstalment  basis. Today users of the  Port  praise\r\n\r\nits efficiency. Surely, Sir, it is difficult for us\r\n\r\nwho  belong to the trade union movement to  believe\r\n\r\nafter this glowing example in the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority  that  the Minister for  Finance  and  my\r\n\r\nother colleagues sincerely mean what they say  when\r\n\r\nthey speak of contract labour. What happened in the\r\n\r\nPort Authority was, in fact, an objective appraisal\r\n\r\nof  the  problem and an objective solution,  worked\r\n\r\nout  in conjunction with the National Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress   representing  the  workers.  From   this\r\n\r\nexample, Sir, the workers of Singapore cannot,  for\r\n\r\na  moment,  believe  that the suggestions  now  put\r\n\r\nforward  and being implemented in the case  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  daily-rated employees are anything  but  an\r\n\r\nintellectual aberration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of a Government dedicated to the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  a more just and equal  society,  I\r\n\r\ncall  upon  my colleagues to discontinue advocating\r\n\r\nthis  practice  of contract labour - unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Finance  is  not  here  -  and\r\n\r\nrecognise clearly the problem affecting the  daily-rated  workers  in  Singapore which  is  simply  to\r\n\r\nsecure a living wage for a proper day's work. I ask\r\n\r\nthem  that,  just  as  in  the  case  of  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority,  they  demonstrate  their  sincerity  by\r\n\r\nentering   into  discussions  with   the   N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nimmediately to find equitable and lasting solutions\r\n\r\nto our current problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to consider with open minds an\r\n\r\nentirely new system if this is finally shown to  us\r\n\r\nto  be  necessary for the long-term  viability  and\r\n\r\nsurvival of Singapore as a nation.

I thought then  that\r\n\r\nmy   predecessor  in  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  who is now the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nhad  satisfactorily replied to the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah. However, though the Member for Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nputs  most of the blame on my predecessor,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  he  says  that  I  am  not  completely\r\n\r\nblameless.  But  he has spoken  well  of  the  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority and perhaps he has forgotten that I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in charge of the Port Authority from the  1st\r\n\r\nof  November, 1964. I remember that from the moment\r\n\r\nI  was  in  charge, we had to introduce a temporary\r\n\r\nsystem  of contract labour in the Port, and it  was\r\n\r\nfor  good reason too. The reason was this.  In  the\r\n\r\nPort  we  had, and we still have, peak periods.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a normal labour force which can look after  a\r\n\r\ncertain number of ships coming in every month,  but\r\n\r\nthe  number of ships coming into Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  same every month. There are peak periods  when\r\n\r\nmore ships come in and the normal number of workmen\r\n\r\ncannot satisfactorily unload all the goods from the\r\n\r\nships. That was the reason why contract labour  was\r\n\r\ntaken  on as a temporary measure. But the immediate\r\n\r\nresult  of bringing in contract labour was that  we\r\n\r\nmet with protests from the union. At the same time,\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of the workers of the new union went\r\n\r\nup.  However, we settled that matter satisfactorily\r\n\r\nwhen we agreed to stop using contract labour within\r\n\r\nthree  months. We looked for a device  and  it  was\r\n\r\nthis.  We formed a temporary labour pool consisting\r\n\r\nof  about  600 or 700 labourers who reported  every\r\n\r\nday.  If  they had no work, they would  be  paid  a\r\n\r\ndollar a day, and if there was work for them,  they\r\n\r\nwould  be paid the regular wage. At the moment,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  casual labour pool of about  700  workmen.\r\n\r\nThey   are   temporary,  but  whenever  there   are\r\n\r\nvacancies in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent  establishment, these temporary labourers\r\n\r\nbecome  permanent. But this temporary  labour  pool\r\n\r\nmeets the situation during peak periods. There,  we\r\n\r\nhad  a  good excuse to use contract labour and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, we found a method or device whereby\r\n\r\nwe got rid of contract labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah says that there has\r\n\r\nbeen no improvement for over two years. Now perhaps\r\n\r\nI  should  tell him why contract labour has  to  be\r\n\r\nused  sometimes, though, as a general  policy,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  against it. At  the  same  time,  I\r\n\r\nshould point out to him the advantages sometimes of\r\n\r\ncontract  labour.  Sometimes existing  departmental\r\n\r\nlabour  and  resources are unable  to  tackle  some\r\n\r\nmaintenance  work  efficiently  and  speedily   due\r\n\r\neither  to the size of the work or to the need  for\r\n\r\nspecialised   skills   ----   for   instance,   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  intricate and expensive  equipment\r\n\r\nlike  pumps in sewerage pumping stations and sewage\r\n\r\ndisposal    plants,   renovation   of    Government\r\n\r\nbuildings, major face-lifting, etc. One outstanding\r\n\r\nexample  is the case of repairs to Anderson  Bridge\r\n\r\nwhere  welding  work  had to  be  done  by  skilled\r\n\r\ncontract  labour as the departmental labour  lacked\r\n\r\nsuch  skill.  Experience  has  shown  that  it   is\r\n\r\nsometimes more economical, efficient and speedy  to\r\n\r\nemploy  contract  labour. Departmental  work  costs\r\n\r\nmore because of fixed hours of work and often over-time  allowances must be paid for work  done  after\r\n\r\nnormal   hours   or   on   public   holidays,   and\r\n\r\ndepartmental transport must be provided. Again, the\r\n\r\nrate of absenteeism among departmental employees is\r\n\r\nquite  high  and,  in  some  cases,  has  adversely\r\n\r\naffected  work  at the site. For example,  where  a\r\n\r\nplant  operator  or a driver is absent,  then  that\r\n\r\nparticular plant will be left idle, unless there is\r\n\r\na standby operator easily available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should cite to the House just one\r\n\r\nexample,  comparing the costs for work carried  out\r\n\r\nby   departmental  labour  with  contract   labour.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House must  know  very  well  the\r\n\r\nbungalows  \"Brighton\"  and \"Hove\"  at  Changi.  The\r\n\r\nrepairs  of the seawall carried out by departmental\r\n\r\nlabour consisted of plastering the seawall 150 feet\r\n\r\nlong by 6 feet high and the breakdown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  costs  was  as  follows:  wages,  $685.80;\r\n\r\ncement, $81; sand, $15; and transport, $50 -  total\r\n\r\ncost $831.80. This worked Out at an average cost of\r\n\r\n$5.56  per  foot  run.  This  was  carried  out  by\r\n\r\ndepartmental labour. The repairs of the seawall  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Kling Police Station were carried  out  by\r\n\r\ncontract  labour. The repair work was  similar  and\r\n\r\nthe  wall  was  of  the same height.  The  cost  of\r\n\r\nplastering  520  feet long of seawall  was  $2,340,\r\n\r\nwhich  worked out at an average of $4.50  per  foot\r\n\r\nrun,  which is about $1 less per foot run and about\r\n\r\n20  per  cent  less  than  the  foot  run  done  by\r\n\r\ndepartmental labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has referred to grass\r\n\r\ncutting   by  the  Public  Works  Department.   The\r\n\r\nposition here is that prior to 1960 the P.W.D. was\r\n\r\nresponsible  for grass cutting in the  rural  areas\r\n\r\nand  employed departmental labour, whereas the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  was  responsible for grass cutting  within\r\n\r\nthe  City and the City Council farmed out the  work\r\n\r\nto  contractors. This means that for  most  of  the\r\n\r\ntime  P.W.D. labourers will be  riding  on  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nlorries  going  from one place to  another  cutting\r\n\r\ngrass  in  various  parts of  the  rural  areas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is not difficult to imagine that most\r\n\r\nof  the  time departmental labour will be spent  in\r\n\r\nassembling,  mustering, and transporting  labourers\r\n\r\nfrom  the  mustering points to where the grass  is,\r\n\r\nworking  for  a  short period, and then  collecting\r\n\r\nthem   again  to  transport  them  back  to   their\r\n\r\nquarters. Is it little wonder, Sir, that  the  cost\r\n\r\nof  grass  cutting by departmental  labour  on  the\r\n\r\naverage  works  out  at $25 per  acre,  whereas  by\r\n\r\ncontract the cost is less than $16 per acre?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also referred to\r\n\r\nseawalls  and  signal light posts in the  area.  In\r\n\r\nthis   connection,  minor  works   connected   with\r\n\r\nrepairs, maintenance and repainting of these  items\r\n\r\nare  done by departmental labour. Only major  works\r\n\r\nof  construction or major repairs are given out  to\r\n\r\ncontractors. In 1964, however, buoys, signal  posts\r\n\r\nand  beacons  were taken over by  the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMarine,  and  departmental labour  in  the  P.W.D.,\r\n\r\nwhich should have gone over to the Marine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment,  would have been employed  to  continue\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  minor repairs  work.  The  P.W.D.\r\n\r\ndaily-rated   labour,  however,   refused   to   be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Marine Department,  and  all  of\r\n\r\nthem are being retained in the Marine Branch of the\r\n\r\nP.W.D.  It  is  true that in most of  these  marine\r\n\r\nrepair  works, the time when such work  has  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  will be dictated by the tide. Now, our daily-rated  labourers work fixed hours and none of  them\r\n\r\nwill  wait for the time or the tide. The Union,  in\r\n\r\nfact, has refused to accept the P.W.D.'s suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  working hours will be amended or  revised  to\r\n\r\nsuit  the  conditions of the tide. Hence,  contract\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also referred to\r\n\r\ncarts  for  rubbish and nightsoil bins  as  coming\r\n\r\nunder  the  P.W.D. I am afraid this does  not  come\r\n\r\nunder  my jurisdiction. It comes under that of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health who, I believe, is waiting  to\r\n\r\nsay something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has quoted from the\r\n\r\nReport of the Commission of Inquiry into the System\r\n\r\nof  Contract Labour in Singapore. This was a report\r\n\r\nwhich  came out in 1960. It did point out the evils\r\n\r\nof  contract labour as has been recited by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  but  it  also spoke of the  advantages  of\r\n\r\ncontract labour, and I quote paragraph 50  at  page\r\n\r\n13:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The system of contractor labour appears to have\r\n\r\ncertain advantages:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) division of labour;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) decentralisation of functions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) control of cost.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These advantages may be more general with\r\n\r\ntechnical   labour,   technical   contractors   and\r\n\r\nspecialised  principals, than  in  the  case  where\r\n\r\nunskilled and semi-skilled manual labour is in use.\r\n\r\nIt  is true, in fact, that elsewhere, overseas  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  there  are segments of  labour  employed\r\n\r\nunder   a   contractor  system.  They  are   always\r\n\r\ntechnical  segments  highly organised  associations\r\n\r\nand/or  trade unions, highly paid, and  covered  by\r\n\r\nthoroughly    policed   and   very   wide    labour\r\n\r\nlegislation. This is the case for instance  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  none  of these countries, however, is unskilled\r\n\r\nlabour  employed under a contractor system  in  any\r\n\r\nway similar to that in operation in Singapore.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this Report did not say that all contract\r\n\r\nlabour   should   be   got   rid   of.   It    made\r\n\r\nrecommendations for the removal of contract  labour\r\n\r\nin certain trades, but not in all. For instance, at\r\n\r\npage 73:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Commission arrived at the conclusion that in\r\n\r\nneither the building and construction industry, nor\r\n\r\nin  the  electrical  and plumbing  trades,  was  it\r\n\r\npossible to suggest changes from contractor  labour\r\n\r\nsystem  to  direct labour employment. We  were  all\r\n\r\nagreed, however, that a number of safeguards  could\r\n\r\nbe  introduced to bring the terms of employment  of\r\n\r\nthis  segment  of  labour in  line  with  those  of\r\n\r\ndirectly employed personnel.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind this House, Sir, that some of the\r\n\r\nMembers  of this Commission were people  like  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee Suan and Woodhull - purported champions of the\r\n\r\nlabour  class. But even they did not say, \"Get  rid\r\n\r\nof all contract labour,\" but only in some trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I end up, Sir, by saying that we as a\r\n\r\nGovernment  would like, if it is possible,  to  get\r\n\r\nrid of all contract labour. We realise the evils of\r\n\r\nthe  system as pointed out by the Member  for  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah, but sometimes it is not possible to do  away\r\n\r\nwith  contract  labour. In the Port  Authority,  an\r\n\r\nexample  which  I have mentioned, we discussed  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and  managed to find a solution  which  was\r\n\r\nacceptable to the Union. As a result, I am glad  to\r\n\r\nsay  that even the Member for Bras Basah has agreed\r\n\r\nthat the Port is working efficiently, and that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  happy with the bonus system  and  the\r\n\r\nshift system. If the National Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nhas any suggestions whereby contract labour can  be\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  permanent  labour  in  any   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartments that come under my jurisdiction, I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him that I will give his suggestions  every\r\n\r\nconsideration. But we may come up against obstacles\r\n\r\nlike  the tide, for instance. It is no use  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Get departmental labour.\" We will get departmental\r\n\r\nlabour  provided the particular labourer is willing\r\n\r\nto  work  at  12  midnight. So on that  basis,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I think I should end now and give  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Health, a little  time\r\n\r\nto say what he wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the hon.

I  understand  there   was   a\r\n\r\ncontract not within the last two years but as  long\r\n\r\nago  as  1959 - seven years ago, and rather out  of\r\n\r\ndate I should say -and the contract was let out for\r\n\r\n3,000  nightsoil pails at the rate of  $3.57  each;\r\n\r\nand  that ever since 1960 such work has been  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  through  departmental labour. I  would  like,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, to say that I regret that the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Bras Basah has made a general statement\r\n\r\nwhich  is not true. And if it is true, that  it  is\r\n\r\nseven  years  behind  time. [Interruption]  I  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  that, Sir, when I am in a position  to\r\n\r\nanswer  specific complaints. But if it is a general\r\n\r\nstatement, I am afraid I am just being drawn into a\r\n\r\ndiscussion on other topics. Sir, I welcome the hon.\r\n\r\nMember putting forward specific complaints to which\r\n\r\nI will then give him my answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, unfortunately, in his long speech, he\r\n\r\nbrought  in  topics like, \"How is  it  possible  to\r\n\r\nassess  the output of a cleansing worker,  say,  in\r\n\r\nTanglin, as compared with a cleansing worker  in  a\r\n\r\nnew  housing  estate  or at hawker  congregations?\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I have indicated earlier on that part of  the\r\n\r\nplan  for  reorganisation of the  public  cleansing\r\n\r\nservice  will  be to start a new system  whereby  a\r\n\r\nrefuse vehicle will have a work force of, say, four\r\n\r\nworkers  including the driver, who  will  be  given\r\n\r\nwhat is called a norm. Naturally the norm will be a\r\n\r\nlittle  different in a congested area from  a  norm\r\n\r\nfor  a  residential area, and a norm  for  a  rural\r\n\r\narea. That will have to be determined. It will  not\r\n\r\nbe  infallible.  And there will, therefore,  be  an\r\n\r\nallotted beat, shall we say, allocated to a team of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  plus  the vehicle with a  daily  quota  of\r\n\r\ndustbins to be collected. It may be 1,000,  it  may\r\n\r\nbe 1,500, or it may just be 500. And I have already\r\n\r\nindicated  that  we  will  not  insist  that   this\r\n\r\nparticular task force work from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. If\r\n\r\nthey  are  efficient enough and be able to complete\r\n\r\ntheir  duties  by 12 o'clock - one  hour  ahead  of\r\n\r\nknocking-off  time - we are going to  start  a  new\r\n\r\nprecedent and say that they can check out  and  not\r\n\r\ntry  to  linger and dilly-dally, park their  refuse\r\n\r\nvehicles  under a shade and spend a long time  over\r\n\r\ncoffee,  or park their refuse vehicles in front  of\r\n\r\njunk shops and bargain over how much they could get\r\n\r\nfor  old  bottles and old tins. What  we  want  our\r\n\r\ncleansing   workers  to  do  is  to  be  reasonably\r\n\r\nefficient  and productive and to do their  allotted\r\n\r\nshare  of  work,  clear and dump the  rubbish,  and\r\n\r\nclean  up and go home. What they do after  that  is\r\n\r\ntheir  business. That is why we want  to  introduce\r\n\r\nnot  just one shift duty but two shift duties. They\r\n\r\nknow  exactly what they are supposed to do. If they\r\n\r\nhave  done  their job, off they go. They get  their\r\n\r\npay  and off they go. And it will be possible  then\r\n\r\nto pin responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. Member for Bras Basah that\r\n\r\nlack  of supervision has been responsible for  what\r\n\r\nhas  gone  wrong.  That is why, in  winding  up  my\r\n\r\nrather  long  reply to the hon.  Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\ntoday over the public cleansing service, I shall be\r\n\r\ninviting  officials not only of the  Public  Daily-Rated  Cleansing  Workers'  Union  but  also   that\r\n\r\nsection  of A.U.P.E., the monthly-rated supervisory\r\n\r\nstaff,  for  a discussion on this matter.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are both jointly responsible for an efficient\r\n\r\nservice.  So I shall be cracking the whip not  only\r\n\r\nat the daily-rated workers but also at the monthly-rated  to do their share of work and try to produce\r\n\r\nsomething  that  is  more like a  public  cleansing\r\n\r\nservice for a city of ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to hear, too in the very early\r\n\r\npart  of  the  speech by the hon.

If the Public Cleansing Department requires the\r\n\r\ncleansing  workers to turn up for work  on  Sundays\r\n\r\nand  on  public  holidays - and may I  repeat  that\r\n\r\nthere  are 52 Sundays and 11 public holidays  in  a\r\n\r\nyear, making a total of 63 days - because it wishes\r\n\r\ncertain  work  to  be  done on Sundays  and  public\r\n\r\nholidays, and it says, \"Yes, we want 300 workers or\r\n\r\n500  workers,\" then it will pay this overtime.  But\r\n\r\nnot where the whole force turn up on the 52 Sundays\r\n\r\nand  the  11 public holidays and clear less  refuse\r\n\r\nthan  they  do under normal working conditions  and\r\n\r\nabsent  themselves on Mondays and on days following\r\n\r\npublic  holidays.
