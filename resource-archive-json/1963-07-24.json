The liquidators  of  two\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies - one from  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nother  from  Malaya  - however, have  already  begun\r\n\r\npaying  out claims to policy holders, and  payments\r\n\r\nare   now  almost  completed.

The\r\n\r\nbetter  our seamen are trained, the more employment\r\n\r\nopportunities there are for them. Therefore,  since\r\n\r\nthe Government has provided such facilities and  at\r\n\r\nsuch  expense,  it is only fair that  the  trainees\r\n\r\nshould  be expected, as a matter of dedication,  to\r\n\r\npay for their own food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, in deserving cases, the Seafarers' Welfare\r\n\r\nBoard  will consider subsidising them with  a  food\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the opportunity to become trainees\r\n\r\nwill  be open to all those who have passed  out  of\r\n\r\nschool,  yes, of course, as far as practicable,  it\r\n\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding question number four, I have mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now  that guarantee of employment depends  on\r\n\r\nhow  successful this scheme is.

At\r\n\r\nthe   moment,  seafarers  are  grouped  in  various\r\n\r\ndivisions  - the engine-room is mostly Chinese,  the\r\n\r\ncatering  department  is  for  Chinese,  and  other\r\n\r\ncategories are for Malays. So if this is the  case,\r\n\r\nI  believe  this  is  not very healthy.  Could  the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned give a definite clarification\r\n\r\nin  this  House in regard to the matter so that  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  clearly understood and no problems  will\r\n\r\narise from that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this point\r\n\r\nlies mainly with the employers.

In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, there are other factors which influence\r\n\r\nemployers to make such a decision. For instance, if\r\n\r\nthey have Chinese and Malays or other nationalities\r\n\r\nin  one  department,  then  they  have  to  provide\r\n\r\ncatering  facilities. From the  point  of  view  of\r\n\r\nconvenience and economy, they will have  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  they would like to have an entire  section\r\n\r\nof their crew of one nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nit  is international practice that seamen who  drop\r\n\r\nin  at  any  port will be registered at that  port.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in following the custom we also register\r\n\r\nall  seamen  who  leave their ships  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is the practice here to register  only\r\n\r\nnew  entrants who are Singapore citizens. Those who\r\n\r\nare  registered  for the first  time  must  possess\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship. But it is equally  true,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Kampong Kembangan says,  that  our\r\n\r\nRegistry  does contain names of seamen  from  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the world.

The present Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to introduce an amendment to that Bill which\r\n\r\nwas debated and forced through only last month, and\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  introduced  on  a  Certificate   of\r\n\r\nUrgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us take our minds back to the debate on\r\n\r\nthe 15th of June. My\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member for Farrer  Park,  was  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Opposition Member to open our  guns  on  the\r\n\r\ndictatorial   P.A.P.  Government.   I   seek   your\r\n\r\nindulgence, Sir, and the indulgence of hon. Members\r\n\r\nto  quote  two paragraphs of his speech  which  are\r\n\r\nvery relevant to the matter now before the House. I\r\n\r\nquote from the Official Report of the debate of the\r\n\r\n15th  June [Unrevised Transcript, page 31- Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol.  20,  No. 11, cols. 1356-7]. This is what  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich  I  wish  to  bring to the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge of this Bill and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law. Under this Ordinance, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the whole of the registration process must  be\r\n\r\ncompleted within the year of registration. What the\r\n\r\nMinister  wants  to do now, what  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nasking  the  House to do rather, is to  extend  the\r\n\r\ntime  to the 30th June in order to enable the  1962\r\n\r\nregisters to be completed. I understand that  steps\r\n\r\nhave already been taken by the Registration Officer\r\n\r\nsome time towards the end of February this year  to\r\n\r\nstart the compilation of the 1962 registers. To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  all  those  steps\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has now taken are ultra vires, null  and\r\n\r\nvoid,  of  no legal effect, so that all the  claims\r\n\r\nand  objections which have been registered, all the\r\n\r\ntentative  registers which he has put up  (Lists  A\r\n\r\nand B) are all illegal and have no effect. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  present  position. All that  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nasking  the House to do is to extend the  time  for\r\n\r\nthe    certification   of   the   registers.    The\r\n\r\ncertification of the registers on the steps  taken,\r\n\r\nto  my  mind,  will be an illegality;  without  the\r\n\r\nsanction of the law. I do not see how, even if this\r\n\r\nAssembly  passes the Bill in the way it is  framed,\r\n\r\nany  certification resulting from the steps already\r\n\r\nhaving  been taken by the Registration Officer  can\r\n\r\nmake these registers valid. Thai is my view which I\r\n\r\nput forward to this House. In spite of this, if the\r\n\r\nMinister  carried this Bill through, it could  well\r\n\r\nbe  that  somebody would contest  the  validity  of\r\n\r\nthese registers, and any elections which were  held\r\n\r\non  the  1962 registers might all be null and  void\r\n\r\nand have no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister whether he has taken the\r\n\r\nadvice of the State Advocate-General on the present\r\n\r\nposition on this specific proposition - that  steps\r\n\r\nalready  having been taken to compile the registers\r\n\r\n(which  stops  are illegal at the moment)  and  the\r\n\r\nBill  drafted in the way that it is without further\r\n\r\nprovisions  which  would cover  the  illegal  steps\r\n\r\nalready  taken by the Registration Officer, whether\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  would, in fact, enable a  proper  valid\r\n\r\nlegal register for 1962 to be completed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also spoke at this sitting, and I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  quote from the same Official  Report  the\r\n\r\nrelevant part of which deals with this legal point.\r\n\r\nThat is at page 38 [Hansard, cols. 1368-9]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Do not press on with something that might turn\r\n\r\nout  to  be a legal problem, as pointed out by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park. Let us say we have the  by-election in Sembawang based on these 1962 electoral\r\n\r\nregisters.  What  is to prevent any  candidate  who\r\n\r\nlost  in the by-election to file a petition on  the\r\n\r\nground  that  the  1962  electoral  registers   are\r\n\r\nillegal and not in accordance with the law? I would\r\n\r\nurge upon the Government to reconsider its stand on\r\n\r\nthis issue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law was silent on this very\r\n\r\nimportant  legal point although we had expected  to\r\n\r\nhear gems of wisdom from him. But the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs replied and that is at page 38 of  the\r\n\r\nunrevised transcript [Hansard, col. 1369]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a temporary provisions\r\n\r\nBill seeking the Assembly's approval to extend  the\r\n\r\ntime   for   the  revision  of  the  registers   of\r\n\r\nelections,  which  should have  been  completed  in\r\n\r\n1962. This Bill was drafted and vetted by the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General,  and so far as  I  can  see,  the\r\n\r\nlegal aspect of it would have been taken care of by\r\n\r\nthe State Advocate-General's Department.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cautioned the Government. We urged it to\r\n\r\nreconsider  its  stand in the light  of  the  legal\r\n\r\npoint  raised  by us. If it had been  a  democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment giving due weight to reasons advanced by\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, if it had not been an arrogant and\r\n\r\na  dictatorial  Government, surely, Sir,  it  could\r\n\r\nhave  deferred the Committee stage of the Bill  for\r\n\r\njust  a  few  hours in order to give the Government\r\n\r\ntime  to consult the State Advocate-General on this\r\n\r\nvery valid legal point raised by the Opposition. If\r\n\r\nthis  step  had been taken, as it should have  been\r\n\r\ntaken, then this amending Bill would not have  been\r\n\r\nnecessary.  All our cautioning, all our  urging  on\r\n\r\nthe  good sense of the Government, was just brushed\r\n\r\naside  by  the dictatorial P.A.P. Government  whose\r\n\r\nleaders  consider  themselves to be  cleverer  than\r\n\r\nanybody else. The whole Opposition fought them.  We\r\n\r\nlost.  But  we were not dismayed. We knew  we  were\r\n\r\nright and we would be proved right. We lost. But we\r\n\r\nwere  aroused and would fight again and  again  and\r\n\r\nagain until we delivered a knock-out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblow  on  a dictatorial Government that sets  party\r\n\r\ninterests  above  the interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before the House is a complete\r\n\r\nadmission that we were right, and with right on our\r\n\r\nside  we  will renew our opposition and  will  vote\r\n\r\nagainst the Bill as we did last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  no  consolation to us to say that  we  were\r\n\r\nright.  No, Sir. All of us have been saying  for  a\r\n\r\nlong,  long time that the P.A.P. has been  arrogant\r\n\r\nand dictatorial. It is only now that the S.P.A. has\r\n\r\nchimed what we have been saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I only want the Member to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  we  who  sit  in  front  are  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Alliance, and not S.P.A. or the  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  one  united force, we will knock  out  the    \r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> S.P.A., Singapore Alliance,\r\n\r\nLabour  Party, or whatnot - they have been  changing\r\n\r\nnames for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House, from what we can see,\r\n\r\nis  important from a very different aspect.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant not in the way that the leader of the new\r\n\r\nAlliance  has stated - the arrogant and dictatorial\r\n\r\nways  of the P.A.P. It is more important than that.\r\n\r\nIt  is important in that this is an example of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. always doing anything and everything to turn\r\n\r\nsomething  illegal into something  legal.  Anything\r\n\r\nwhich is wrong is turned into right. Anything which\r\n\r\nis white is turned into black, and a traitor into a\r\n\r\nso-called hero. This is exact proof of what we have\r\n\r\nbeen saying all along. Now that the P.A.P. realises\r\n\r\nthat  it has done wrong, it is trying to \"legalise\"\r\n\r\nthat  wrong. But does the legalising of that  wrong\r\n\r\nmake it right? However many legal phrases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  uses  to right this wrong afterwards,  a  wrong\r\n\r\nstill remains a wrong.

But, as usual, the Government\r\n\r\nsteam-rollers through everything that it  wants  to\r\n\r\npush  through.  This is an abuse of  power  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. We have seen this for quite some  time.\r\n\r\nAs  it is, parliamentary democracy in Singapore has\r\n\r\nfallen into great disrepute.

Mr Speaker, Sir, as a  matter\r\n\r\nof   fact,  I  would  refer  the  Member  to   this\r\n\r\nparticular clause that we propose to introduce into\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.

Those are the people who have been selling\r\n\r\nout  the rights of the people of Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\ntime  that  they, who want to give  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  working in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  should wake up. This Bill, as far  as  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore are concerned,  is  merely  a\r\n\r\nrepetition  of  what  they have  known  all  along,\r\n\r\nnamely P.A.P. deceit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important significance of this Bill as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the Bill which was passed on  15th  June,\r\n\r\n1963, lies in the fact that it allows the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nexclude  a  large number of voters from the  coming\r\n\r\nelections  and  possibly from the  1964  elections.\r\n\r\nWhether  the Government holds the general elections\r\n\r\nimmediately after the elections to the 15 seats  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central Parliament or next year, it  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the intention of the Government is to exclude\r\n\r\na   large  number  of  voters  from  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters. The electoral registers for 1962 will be\r\n\r\nused  for  the elections this time, and unless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment changes this and has the 1963  Electoral\r\n\r\nRegisters ready for 1964, according to law, it will\r\n\r\nbe  using the 1962 Electoral Registers for the 1964\r\n\r\ngeneral elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, Sir, round about 60,000 babies are\r\n\r\nborn,  and only about 10,000 people die.  So  there\r\n\r\nshould be an addition of at least 50,000 people  to\r\n\r\nthe electoral registers every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already pointed out that the 1962\r\n\r\nElectoral Registers have less voters than the  1961\r\n\r\nelectoral  registers. We asked  the  Minister  many\r\n\r\nquestions, but somehow or other, he fought  shy  of\r\n\r\nanswering  any  one of them. We must remember  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill serves, in effect, to exclude  from  the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers a large number of young men and\r\n\r\nwomen  who  the  P.A.P. know will be against  them.\r\n\r\nThat is the meaning of this Bill. We will oppose it\r\n\r\nright  through  all its stages, and  we  hope  that\r\n\r\nconsequent on the criticisms that we bring up,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not try to shut out the huge number\r\n\r\nof  voters  who should, by right, have a chance  to\r\n\r\nvote.

But they were convinced they were  right,\r\n\r\nand  with  their  normal  arrogance  and  in  their\r\n\r\ntraditional manner, they proceeded with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why have they suddenly changed their minds?\r\n\r\nThere has been no representation since the Bill was\r\n\r\npassed.  It is not because of the doubts that  were\r\n\r\nexpressed  on the day that they forced through  the\r\n\r\nmeasure,  hut it is because they have learnt  since\r\n\r\nthen  that in fact the Opposition advice is correct\r\n\r\nand  the  conduct  of  the Executive  in  purported\r\n\r\npursuance  of the Ordinance was illegal.  But  have\r\n\r\nthey  the courage and the decency to admit it?

He tells  you\r\n\r\nthat  the Member of the Barisan Sosialis who  spoke\r\n\r\non  this  measure erred in saying that this  clause\r\n\r\nvalidates  all criminal acts because it  says  \"all\r\n\r\nacts in pursance of the purposes of the revision of\r\n\r\nsuch registers\". Well, Mr Speaker, I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat if the Minister were to consult those who read\r\n\r\nthe  law  without P.A.P. spectacles, he would  find\r\n\r\nthat  in  fact a person can, in purported pursuance\r\n\r\nof  the  revision of the registers, commit criminal\r\n\r\nacts  and that the Registration Officer could,  for\r\n\r\nexample - not that I say he does - conspire with the\r\n\r\nMinister  or  other  political  Parties   for   the\r\n\r\npurposes   of  criminally  refusing  or   admitting\r\n\r\npersons  who would be entitled to be registered  or\r\n\r\nwho  are  not entitled to be registered.  We  could\r\n\r\nhave,  for  example,  5,000  members  of  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade   registered   in   every   one   of    our\r\n\r\nconstituencies in purported pursuance of the powers\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of the revision of such registers.\r\n\r\nThis clause, Mr Speaker, does not deal merely with\r\n\r\nacts  that  are done bona fide. It deals  with  all\r\n\r\nacts - criminal and legitimate. I say that that  is\r\n\r\nyet  another  approach, that they  should  seek  an\r\n\r\namendment  is  right,  since there  has  been  this\r\n\r\npassage  of time and acts have been performed.  But\r\n\r\nthe spirit in which it is sought and the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich the amendment is placed before this House,  I\r\n\r\nsay to you, Mr Speaker, are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave read the Explanatory Statement provided by the\r\n\r\nGovernment in support of this Bill. On page  2,  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... this Bill seeks to remove any doubt that may\r\n\r\nexist as to the validity of acts done ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  Explanatory  Statement,  I  take  it,  is   a\r\n\r\nstatement  being  put  out  by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the  whole House to agree to  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nNormally, the speech by the Minister in conduct  of\r\n\r\nany particular Bill will be in the spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Explanatory Statement. Whereas listening to\r\n\r\nthe Minister's speech, he most definitely said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was satisfied  that  the  Bill  as\r\n\r\npassed by the House was sufficient for the purposes\r\n\r\nfor which it was intended, if that is the stand  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  then I think it would  have  been\r\n\r\ncompletely logical if the Government had refused to\r\n\r\nbring  in  this amending Bill. The reason given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  was  that he wished  to  accommodate\r\n\r\ncertain  Opposition views, although he himself  was\r\n\r\nnot  convinced of those views but that in order  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  those  views  even  though  they   are\r\n\r\nincorrect  this amending Bill has been  introduced.\r\n\r\nNow  really,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask you,  in  all\r\n\r\nseriousness,  should  the  Minister  in  his  right\r\n\r\nsenses   get  up  in  this  House  and  say.   \"The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not convinced that certain  sections\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition are correct,\" and yet waste  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  the  House by bringing in a useless  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  in  his view is a useless Bill? Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  quite frankly, so far as we on this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House are concerned, if the Minister does,  in\r\n\r\nfact, think that this does not add one iota to  the\r\n\r\nlegality of the previous Bill that has been passed,\r\n\r\nlet  him  withdraw  this Bill. I challenge  him  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second point I wish to raise is a matter which I think has been touched upon by the Member for Anson. As the clause is phrased, it could cover two aspects of all acts taken by the Registration Officer. One set of acts taken by the Registrar are procedural steps which result in the\r\n\r\nregisters being compiled and certified. The  second\r\n\r\nset of acts taken by the Registrar is in the nature\r\n\r\nof  a  quasi-judicial  inquiry  which  affects  the\r\n\r\nrights of the citizen. Now it could be that the way\r\n\r\nthis clause is worded it could affect the rights of\r\n\r\nan  individual on the question of his  name  having\r\n\r\nbeen  left  out  from  the  register.  If  this  is\r\n\r\nintended as a covering act for all those acts which\r\n\r\ndeprive  the citizen of his basic electoral rights,\r\n\r\nthen I think this clause as phrased here should  be\r\n\r\nobjected  to.  But if it is merely  a  question  of\r\n\r\nsaying that all acts taken by the Registrar with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview to producing the registers after 31st December\r\n\r\nshall  be  deemed  to have been taken  before  31st\r\n\r\nDecember,  there  is some point  in  this  amending\r\n\r\nBill. But if it is to validate the rejection of  an\r\n\r\napplication  to  have a name put on  the  register,\r\n\r\nthen this clause should be objected to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  on  the  compilation  of  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  for  1962,  today  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nintroduced  another Bill for the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  validate the actions of the Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer  before  or  after  the  passing   of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition has always been against this method. We oppose such actions because, as I have said on previous Bills, we want a House which practises parliamentary democracy. I hope the Government will introduce Bills into this House in a fair way. The practice is to inform the\r\n\r\nOpposition  according  to parliamentary  democracy.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  do not expect it to be carried  out  that\r\n\r\nfar,   but   the  Government  should  not  suddenly\r\n\r\nintroduce Bills in this Assembly and give no chance\r\n\r\nto the Opposition to consider them. If we study the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement,  it  is  clear   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to play down the allegation  that\r\n\r\nit is acting unfairly and illegally in carrying out\r\n\r\nits  objectives.  In this way,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nobstructing  us from finding out what it  wants  to\r\n\r\ncarry out and so bringing their actions before  the\r\n\r\ncourt.  This is one of the things we are not  happy\r\n\r\nabout.  If we live in a free country where  we  can\r\n\r\npractise  democracy, there must  be  the  right  to\r\n\r\nbring  a matter to court. This should be encouraged\r\n\r\nbecause    it   will   not   only   smoothen    our\r\n\r\nadministration, but it will also give an  assurance\r\n\r\nto  the people that they can practise their rights.\r\n\r\nIf the Government takes the opportunity to legalise\r\n\r\nthe wrong that it has done, this will be bad for  a\r\n\r\nhealthy country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Explanatory Statement - I will read this in English.

At  the   end   of   this\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement, there is a  sentence  which\r\n\r\nsays that this Bill seeks to remove any doubt which\r\n\r\nmay  exist as to the validity of acts done  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer for the purposes  of  revising\r\n\r\nthe registers in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Mr Speaker, we have heard doubts\r\n\r\nand  rumours that the Government is carrying out  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  transfer their voters and supporters.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an act which they are trying to cover  up\r\n\r\nthrough  this  Bill, and which later on  we  cannot\r\n\r\ntake  to court. Lately we have heard over the radio\r\n\r\nand television that the Prime Minister made visits.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not questioned, Mr Speaker,  because  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Government has all the  facilities,\r\n\r\nall  the  machinery,  in  their  hands.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself has challenged the workers in  the\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board and made them frightened -  \"We  are\r\n\r\nnot stupid,\" and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, it is quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  we  are  near  election  time  because\r\n\r\neverybody  has been making a lot of fuss over  what\r\n\r\nis  a very simple issue. The last time I think  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, in particular, the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, indicated that they had  some  doubts\r\n\r\nabout  the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Ordinance.  They\r\n\r\nexpressed  some  doubts  that  if  elections   were\r\n\r\ncarried  out,  somebody could  invalidate  all  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Ordinance. The  Government  was\r\n\r\ncertain,  hut  what we are doing, in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentations made, is that we are making it more\r\n\r\ncertain that the provisions of the Ordinance  would\r\n\r\nnot be questioned later on in the courts of law.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a lawyer, Sir, but I understand that  most\r\n\r\nlawyers flourish because provisions of the law  are\r\n\r\nnever  a  hundred per cent certain.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nsomebody has indicated some kind of loophole in the\r\n\r\nlaw,  then  it  is  our duty to  bring  forward  an\r\n\r\namendment  to ensure that that loophole is  closed.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is what this amendment seeks to  do.  For\r\n\r\nall  I  know,  Sir, if the S.P.A. or  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nshould  win  the next election, then  it  is  quite\r\n\r\npossible that somebody may query the whole validity\r\n\r\nof  the  elections, bring it before a court of  law\r\n\r\nand  invalidate the whole process. To that  extent,\r\n\r\nthis  amendment would ensure that if the S.P.A. or\r\n\r\nthe Barisan should win the next election, the whole\r\n\r\nprocess is not invalidated because of a loophole in\r\n\r\nthe  law.  Therefore, probably it is quite possible\r\n\r\nthat  the  Barisan have decided that they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing to win the next election, so, \"Let us make  a\r\n\r\nfuss  about  this little amendment.\" So I  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir, that there is no question of the P.A.P. or the\r\n\r\nGovernment  trying to pull a fast  one.  This  Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not favour either the P.A.P. or the Barisan or\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. It ensures that the Ordinance  is  more\r\n\r\nfoolproof than it is at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T.

If  it\r\n\r\nis  certain, I do not see what can prevent it  from\r\n\r\nwithdrawing this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister tries to suggest that out of\r\n\r\nkindness  to  the Barisan and the  S.P.A.,  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan or the S.P.A. should win, the P.A.P. do not\r\n\r\nwant  someone  to  go to court and  invalidate  the\r\n\r\nelections.  And  out  of  kindness  they  want   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill. Surely,  Sir,  we  know  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. well, and the people know the P.A.P. well.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not going to do anything out of kindness - out  of anything - for any Opposition group, be  it\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing  S.P.A. or the Barisan  or  anybody\r\n\r\nelse  for that matter.

What it seeks to do is  to  legalise\r\n\r\ncriminal  acts. Sir, we know that its intention  is\r\n\r\nto legalise illegal criminal acts which can be done\r\n\r\nby  a  few  civil servants because  they  would  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  do them on instruction from the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nSir,  the conduct of the Government in the past  is\r\n\r\nample  proof that it will not hesitate to stoop  to\r\n\r\nany indecent level. By any standard, the Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is a legal rigging, because they  passed\r\n\r\nthe  Bill here. It was adopted, made into law  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it has legal backing. But,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nwhat  happened was rigging. I do not think any  man\r\n\r\nwho  chooses to be honest can stand up and say with\r\n\r\na clear conscience that the results of the national\r\n\r\nreferendum reflected the will and the desire of the\r\n\r\npeople. Sir, having judged them by their manner  of\r\n\r\nconducting  the National Referendum and by  various\r\n\r\nother  acts,  they  are  capable  of  rigging   the\r\n\r\nelections.

Why\r\n\r\ncannot  we  let  the Bill go through  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nparliamentary procedure of three separate Readings?\r\n\r\nThe  fact that the Government have seen fit to rush\r\n\r\na  Bill like this through the unusual procedure  of\r\n\r\nthree Readings shows that, to them, it has become a\r\n\r\nvital  issue. The public must not be given a chance\r\n\r\nto  know that this is being discussed in the House.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  would  like  to ask the  Government  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  Why do they consider Bills  relating  to\r\n\r\nelections  as being so urgent at this  stage?  They\r\n\r\nhave seen fit to postpone the Sembawang by-election\r\n\r\nfor  nearly  a  year.  Their reason  was  that  the\r\n\r\nelectoral registers were not quite ready and  there\r\n\r\nmust  be time for revision and so on. And now,  all\r\n\r\nof  a  sudden, all Bills relating to elections must\r\n\r\nbe  rushed through. They know the reason why.  They\r\n\r\nsought  to conceal the reason, Sir. They have  gone\r\n\r\nahead electioneering in an improper manner, without\r\n\r\ngiving the other Parties knowledge that an election\r\n\r\nis   pending;  using  public  funds  and  all   the\r\n\r\npropaganda  machinery  under  the  control  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  we consider improper.  If  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  they have logic and reason  and  any\r\n\r\nsense  of fair play, how could they, without giving\r\n\r\ndue notice to the runners, summon their own runners\r\n\r\nahead,  get them on the mark, get set and fire  the\r\n\r\npistol? That is what they are trying to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Party in power dare not follow the rules of\r\n\r\nthe game, they are setting a bad example for future\r\n\r\ngovernments.  Parliamentary  democracy   will   not\r\n\r\nsucceed  if the rules are easily pushed aside  just\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is to the advantage of  the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower so to do.

To try to do that is to show that they\r\n\r\nare  trying  to do things in their own way  and  to\r\n\r\ncatch the Opposition and the public by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another issue was mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson, and that is this clause where the words \"all\r\n\r\nacts\"  practically validate or legalise  any  wrong\r\n\r\nacts  of  the Registration Officer. It is a serious\r\n\r\nmatter.   \"All   acts\"  - very  comprehensive.   The\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer surely is a human being liable\r\n\r\nto  err. But under this Bill, if passed, he becomes\r\n\r\nsomebody  who cannot err, or if he errs,  then  his\r\n\r\nerrors  must become legal and right. Sir, it  is  a\r\n\r\nbig  issue to give all that power to a man,  unless\r\n\r\nthe  idea,  the  aim,  of the  Government  is  that\r\n\r\nthrough  this particular gentleman, they  can  from\r\n\r\ntheir   bag  of  tricks,  which  have  been   quite\r\n\r\nplentiful,  produce something which they  can  push\r\n\r\nthrough  this gentleman and mislead the electorate.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am afraid this Bill involves quite  a  big\r\n\r\nissue  and  a  dangerous issue which  we  dare  not\r\n\r\naccept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 15th June, page 39 in the typescript, the\r\n\r\nsixth  paragraph  [unrevised transcript]  (Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol.  20, No. 11, col. 1370), the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As for the revision of the 1963 pre-electoral\r\n\r\nregisters, I wish to inform the House that work has\r\n\r\nalready  been set in motion. In fact,  revision  of\r\n\r\nthe 1963 registers is being carried out now ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the revision of the 1963 registers is\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out now, why should there  be  this\r\n\r\nunholy  haste where everything, including  mistakes\r\n\r\nmade  in the 1962 registers, is legalised?  Sir, I\r\n\r\nventure  the reason; that after giving  the  public\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that  there  will  be  no  Federal\r\n\r\nelections  until  one year after Malaysia  Day,  as\r\n\r\ndiscussed   between   them   and   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, without the Opposition being consulted,\r\n\r\nthey  suddenly decided it is to their advantage  to\r\n\r\nstart  the football match, not at the regular  time\r\n\r\nof  five  o'clock, but at their own  time,  at  one\r\n\r\no'clock, while the others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  having lunch. That, to them, is fair play. So,\r\n\r\nall of a sudden, thinking that that is the best way\r\n\r\nto  catch  the Opposition by surprise and  have  an\r\n\r\nunfair  advantage  in  the  elections,  they   have\r\n\r\ndecided, \"Well, we let the Prime Minister go  round\r\n\r\non   his   fashion  parade.  Do  not  say   it   is\r\n\r\nelectioneering. No, say he is on his  State  visit.\r\n\r\nThen  when we have covered enough ground,  we  rush\r\n\r\nthrough  all  these Bills.\" Sir, if  what  we  have\r\n\r\nsurmised is not true, well, the Party in power  can\r\n\r\neasily do the right thing. Withdraw this Bill,  let\r\n\r\nus have the 1963 registers prepared; let us have an\r\n\r\nelection   based  on  registers  which  cannot   be\r\n\r\nregarded as being cooked; let us not have this Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  will validate and legalise all acts  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand\r\n\r\nhow   the  Opposition  can  lead  themselves   into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that  we  are being arrogant  and  being\r\n\r\ndictatorial  because we introduce this Bill  before\r\n\r\nthe  House. A point of legal difficulty was pointed\r\n\r\nout to us in the course of the debate the last time\r\n\r\nthe  Bill was before this House. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  might  be some substance in  that  point  of\r\n\r\nlegal difficulty or there might be nothing in it at\r\n\r\nall.  The  constitutional course open to  us  would\r\n\r\nhave  been to adjourn the Third Reading of the Bill\r\n\r\nand  look into the matter further at that time,  or\r\n\r\nintroduce this new Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also been accused of rushing through this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency. Now, this Bill provides that a new clause should be added to the previous Bill, a clause of only eight lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the revision of the electoral registers for 1962 should have been completed on or before the 15th of September, 1962. This was not done for a variety of reasons which the Minister for Home Affairs has already explained to the House at the last sitting. The Singapore Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly     Elections    (Temporary    Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1963, extended the date of completion of\r\n\r\nthe  1962 electoral registers to the 30th of  June,\r\n\r\n1963. The issue is whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding the extension of the  date  of  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of the 1962 registers, there  would  be\r\n\r\nlegal  validity  for  the  procedural  work  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  the preparation  of  the  revised\r\n\r\nregisters  for  1962  outside of  the  time  limits\r\n\r\nprescribed  by sections 10 (1)  and 15  (1)   of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  53). There it is provided,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that every year work on the preparation of the\r\n\r\nrevised  registers should begin sometime after  the\r\n\r\n1st  of  February and be completed by the  15th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember of that same year. Surely it is  not  our\r\n\r\nintention  to ask the House to give legal  validity\r\n\r\nto criminal acts done by anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General is satisfied that the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance passed at the last sitting of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly is sufficient in law to validate  the\r\n\r\nwork  of the Registration Officer in preparing  the\r\n\r\nrevised  registers for 1962 outside the  limits  of\r\n\r\ntime  prescribed by sections 10 (1)  and 15  (1)   of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Legislative  Assembly   Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 53). But to make doubly sure, we\r\n\r\nhave  included  this new validity  section  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance ex abundante cautela.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis   is   the   P.A.P. system  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  When  moving the  Second  Reading,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs explained the reasons for\r\n\r\nthis Bill. He said that the amending Bill passed on\r\n\r\n15th June this year was sufficient for the purpose,\r\n\r\nbut in order to clear the doubts of the Opposition,\r\n\r\nit  was  necessary to table this  Bill  to  further\r\n\r\namend the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th June, when the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  tabled the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections (Temporary Provisions) Bill, the Assembly\r\n\r\nspent  some  three hours debating this undemocratic\r\n\r\nBill. At that time we pointed out to the Government\r\n\r\nthat the amendment was a great departure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the system of parliamentary democracy. We said\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the intention of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nlegalise their illegal acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Minister introduces another Bill, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  (Amendment)  Bill,  only   after   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  discovered  that   the   previous\r\n\r\namending  Bill  was insufficient for  a  particular\r\n\r\npurpose,  that  is to say, although they  tried  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  their  illegal  acts  previously,   those\r\n\r\nillegal  acts  are still illegal  and  they  remain\r\n\r\nillegal.  That  is  why  it is  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister to introduce this Bill to further legalise\r\n\r\nthose  illegal acts. That is to say, on  15th  June\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government \"killed\" 500,000 voters. But\r\n\r\nthey  were  unable to \"kill\" all of them,  although\r\n\r\nthey  \"killed\"  some. So they  are  now  trying  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  their act of \"murdering\" these voters  in\r\n\r\nthis House today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few moments ago, in reply to my question No. 8 on the Order Paper, the Minister said that the 1962 Electoral Registers have about 45,000 new voters. But in reply to my question No. 9, he said that those new electors would have their names entered in the 1963 Electoral Registers, and\r\n\r\nhe  finally  pointed  out that the  1963  Electoral\r\n\r\nRegisters would be completed before 1st March  next\r\n\r\nyear. This accounts for the intention of this  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House. It explains why the  Government\r\n\r\nare  unable to answer the question with  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe number of persons who are actually entitled  to\r\n\r\nvote.  They  know that through this Bill  the  1963\r\n\r\nElectoral Registers will not be ready and therefore\r\n\r\nthe  people will not be able to vote. But  this  is\r\n\r\nquite  different from what the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nhas said - that this Bill is introduced to look after\r\n\r\nthe interests of the Barisan Sosialis or the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nand  to prevent anybody from going to court to  get\r\n\r\nan order that the election is illegal. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  first time that we  have  heard  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture saying such  kind  words  to\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition. As a matter of fact,  it\r\n\r\nis  the intention and purpose of the Government  to\r\n\r\nlegalise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  this  Assembly all their undemocratic  and\r\n\r\ndictatorial acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the revision of electoral registers is not difficult in so far as printing is concerned. If the Minister finds it impossible to complete the 1963 Electoral Registers because of a shortage of staff or because of financial difficulties or for some other reason, then the simple thing for him to do is to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance to put in a Supplementary Estimate with\r\n\r\nwhich   to   recruit  additional  staff  for   this\r\n\r\nparticular purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have seen the Government spending thousands and thousands of dollars on expanding television programmes and the Army. If the Elections Office has not got enough money, then I believe the Government can easily put before the Assembly a Supplementary Estimate, and this will not endanger the financial position of Singapore to\r\n\r\nany  substantial extent. I am certain that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to put in a Supplementary Estimate,\r\n\r\nas  I have suggested, then Members on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  would  fully  support  it  without  any\r\n\r\nopposition.  So one can very clearly see  that  the\r\n\r\nmotive  of the Government in introducing this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  not  that they are incapable of completing  the\r\n\r\nregisters in time but because they want to preserve\r\n\r\ntheir political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that all Bills relating to elections are introduced by the Government for the purpose of ensuring their own political life. They say that the previous amending Bill was good. Of course, it is good to the P.A.P., but to the people of Singapore it is bad. It is undemocratic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the 1962 Electoral Registers were only completed at the beginning of this month, and were put up for inspection by the public only recently. Many people who voted at the National Referendum discovered that their names do not appear in the latest Electoral Registers. In the eyes of the P.A.P. Government, these people would\r\n\r\ncourageously come forward in the next elections and\r\n\r\nvote   against   the  candidates  of   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately their names\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not appear in the 1962 Electoral Registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> No. (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nall  these  things that I have said  are  based  on\r\n\r\nfacts.  I am not making allegations that cannot  be\r\n\r\nsubstantiated. Mr Speaker, we can see very clearly\r\n\r\nthat  if  the P.A.P. did not introduce the amending\r\n\r\nBill on 15th June, they would have to complete  the\r\n\r\nElectoral Registers within the time limit  set  out\r\n\r\nin  the  Ordinance, and I believe that those people\r\n\r\nwhom  I  have  mentioned just now would  then  have\r\n\r\ntheir names entered in the Register. But because of\r\n\r\nthat  amending Bill, these people do not have their\r\n\r\nnames entered in the latest Electoral Registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whatever the People's Action Party do, and whatever Bills they bring before the House, they only show clearly that they are undemocratic and dictatorial. They have shown their true colours. Their legislation is PAP, legislation, which is oppressive and suppressive and is not aimed at promoting the interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this amending\r\n\r\nBill  is  not  designed to deprive anybody  of  his\r\n\r\nelectoral  rights,  as feared  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park. It is just to validate all procedural\r\n\r\nsteps  taken by the Registration Officer to compile\r\n\r\nthe  1962 Registers. The Bill was drawn up  by  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General's Chambers and approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  State  Advocate-General  himself.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nOpposition Members will agree that the S.A.G. will\r\n\r\nbe  the  last  person to approve any Bill  that  is\r\n\r\nspecifically designed to cover any criminal act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has alleged that the Bill could conveniently leave out the names of any prospective candidates of the Barisan Sosialis. The Registers have been compiled and certified last month, and I do not see how any names could have been left out of the Registers\r\n\r\nnow. I can assure the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember   for  Thomson  that  the  Government   took\r\n\r\nexceptional care to ensure that the names of the 14\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Assemblymen are in the Registers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has alleged just now\r\n\r\nthat   many  people  who  voted  at  the   National\r\n\r\nReferendum  have found that their  names  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  included in the 1962 Registers. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I tried to elucidate this information from him\r\n\r\njust  now, but he refused to give way. There  is  a\r\n\r\nClaims  and Objections period during which  persons\r\n\r\nwho  voted at the National Referendum and who found\r\n\r\nthat their names were not included in the Registers\r\n\r\ncould  file claims to have their names restored  in\r\n\r\nthe  Registers. Unless the Member for Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\ncan  give  details or particulars of these  persons\r\n\r\nwhom he has alleged were deliberately excluded from\r\n\r\nthe  Registers by the Registration Officer, then  I\r\n\r\nthink it is quite proper for me to call him a liar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Inasfar as the Government's position is concerned, we are satisfied that the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Ordinance, 1963, is sufficient for  the\r\n\r\npurpose.  However, because doubts have been  raised\r\n\r\nby the Opposition Members as to the legality of the\r\n\r\nprocedural acts taken by the Registration  Officer,\r\n\r\nthis  amendment is introduced today. The  amendment\r\n\r\nhas   been  introduced  at  the  instance  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members. If now the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nafter  having first cast doubts on the legality  of\r\n\r\nthe   1962   Registers,  are  unhappy  about   this\r\n\r\namendment, then I wish to withdraw this Bill and in\r\n\r\nthis respect I wish to seek your guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> At the moment, the House is seized of\r\n\r\na  motion, that is, the motion that the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.

Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to introduce into Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the English Inheritance  (Family\r\n\r\nProvision)  Act of 1938. As this Bill  will  change\r\n\r\nthe  existing law and will affect the  right  of  a\r\n\r\nperson to will away his property as he likes, it is\r\n\r\nproposed to refer it to a Select Committee so  that\r\n\r\nfull consideration can be given to its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the former English law did provide for family\r\n\r\nprovision  in giving the wife a right to dower,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  which if the wife survived her  husband\r\n\r\nshe  became  entitled to an estate for  life  in  a\r\n\r\nthird  of all her husband's freeholds of which  she\r\n\r\nhas been seized at any time during the marriage. As\r\n\r\nthis  right  to the wife attached even  though  the\r\n\r\nhusband alienated the land, it gave rise to a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of practical inconvenience and was eventually\r\n\r\nabolished  by  the  Dower Act of 1833.  After  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  nothing to stop a man (or a woman  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  her separate property), from  devising\r\n\r\nand bequeathing his whole estate to charity or to a\r\n\r\ncomplete   stranger  and  leaving  his  widow   and\r\n\r\nchildren  penniless. It was to  prevent  this  evil\r\n\r\nthat the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act of 1938\r\n\r\nwas enacted. The Act did not cast upon the testator\r\n\r\nany  positive duty to make reasonable provision for\r\n\r\nhis  dependants,  for  it would  be  impossible  to\r\n\r\nimpose any such obligation, but it provides that if\r\n\r\nhe  fails  to  do  so  the  Court  may  order  such\r\n\r\nreasonable  provision as it thinks fit to  be  made\r\n\r\nout of the estate for his dependants as defined  in\r\n\r\nthe  Act.  The Act was further amended in  1952  to\r\n\r\nextend  it  to cases of intestacy, as it  was  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the general laws of intestacy might  leave  a\r\n\r\nchild  inadequately  provided for.  The  provisions\r\n\r\nrelating to family provisions appear to have worked\r\n\r\nwell  in  England and it is proposed  to  introduce\r\n\r\nthem into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim Law contains provisions to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the position of widows and  children  in\r\n\r\ncases  of  intestacy.

Mr Rajah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are one or two points which,\r\n\r\nwith your permission, I wish to touch upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clause 3 of the Bill - that is the important\r\n\r\nclause  of  the Bill. The Bill deals with  the  net\r\n\r\nestate, the net estate being the estate less  debts\r\n\r\nand funeral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand testamentary expenses and estate duty as on the\r\n\r\ndate  of  death  of the deceased person.  Now,  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Bill is, in so far as the  family\r\n\r\nis  concerned, to protect the husband or  the  wife\r\n\r\nand  the  children. There is nothing  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich will preclude a person from assigning all his\r\n\r\nproperty away to somebody before his death. If  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Bill is social, and it wishes  to\r\n\r\nprotect the wife and child, that position could  be\r\n\r\ndefeated, it seems to me, under this Bill by a  man\r\n\r\nassigning  his  property away two days  before  his\r\n\r\ndeath,  because the property which is  affected  by\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is the net estate on the  date  of  his\r\n\r\ndeath. That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point could be this. A husband during\r\n\r\nhis lifetime might have made adequate provision for\r\n\r\nhis  wife and children and die intestate, but under\r\n\r\nthe provision of clause 3, it would appear that  .a\r\n\r\nfurther  provision would become necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nwife and the children. This is the second point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which readily occurs to my mind is\r\n\r\na  daughter who has not been married or who  is  by\r\n\r\nreason   of  some  mental  or  physical  disability\r\n\r\nincapable of maintaining herself. Supposing such  a\r\n\r\ndaughter is married and dies with her husband, what\r\n\r\nthen is the position?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are what strike me as being some of the\r\n\r\nmatters  which could arise if the Bill were  passed\r\n\r\nin its present form. I may be wrong, Sir, but these\r\n\r\nare  matters which readily arise to my mind at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I will certainly take note of what the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  as  Chairman  and  seven  Members  to   be\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the  Committee of  Selection.  -[Mr\r\n\r\nByrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  that this Bill be  proceeded  with.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund  Ordinance  so  that   the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund Board may not be restricted\r\n\r\nin  declaring a higher rate of interest than 2\u00ab per\r\n\r\ncent  per  annum to contributions of the  Fund.

The Board  is  in  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  position to declare  a  higher  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest  than  2\u00bd  per  cent  per  annum,  as  the\r\n\r\nredemption value of the Board's investments is very\r\n\r\nmuch more than its liabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nOrdinance    have    been   introduced    on    the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Central Provident Fund  Board\r\n\r\nfrom  the  experience gained in  administering  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  since it came into force  on  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will be moving that this Bill be committed to\r\n\r\na  Select  Committee after its  Second  Reading,  I\r\n\r\nshall  only  touch briefly on the  other  important\r\n\r\namendments  which this Bill seeks to  make  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 introduces a definition of the word\r\n\r\n\"employed\" and modifies the existing definitions of\r\n\r\nthe words \"employee\" and \"employer\" in section 2 of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the amendments read in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith clause 9 are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to extend the benefits of the Ordinance to\r\n\r\ncertain  classes of workers who at present  because\r\n\r\nof  their  conditions of employment do not  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to make the principal employer who may not be\r\n\r\nthe immediate employer of an employee liable to pay\r\n\r\ncontributions under the Ordinance, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to limit the application of the Ordinance in\r\n\r\nthe  case of seamen to Singapore citizens only, and\r\n\r\nto  anticipate  the  possibility  that  it  may  be\r\n\r\ndesirous  to exempt owners of vessels  who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  place  of business in Singapore  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also introduces a new definition of\r\n\r\n\"wages\"  as  the existing definition  is  extremely\r\n\r\ncumbersome   and   has  led  to   difficulties   in\r\n\r\ninterpretation.  The  proposed  amendment   defines\r\n\r\n\"wages\" simply as remuneration in money due  `to  a\r\n\r\nperson in respect of his employment as an employee.\r\n\r\nThe  effect of the amendment is, however,  modified\r\n\r\nby  paragraph (g)  of clause 5 which provides  that,\r\n\r\nfor   the   purpose  of  calculating  contributions\r\n\r\npayable  in  accordance with the  Schedule  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  any casual overtime earned by  a  time-rated employee in regular employment over and above\r\n\r\nhis usual earnings may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of employees who are not paid by time\r\n\r\nor who are not in regular employment, contributions\r\n\r\nto the Fund will be based on the total remuneration\r\n\r\nin money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 4 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  empower an inspector to  examine  or\r\n\r\nsummon  for  examination an employer  in  the  same\r\n\r\nmanner   as  an  employee  in  regard  to   matters\r\n\r\nconnected   with   the  Ordinance.

The\r\n\r\nproviso   to   the  new  subsection  modifies   the\r\n\r\namendment  to the definition of \"wages\"  which  has\r\n\r\nalready been explained in clause 2 above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 10 of the Ordinance to\r\n\r\nremove the provision under which employees over the\r\n\r\nage  of 55 may become members of the Fund by giving\r\n\r\nnotice  to the Board within one month of the coming\r\n\r\ninto force of the Ordinance that they desire to  be\r\n\r\nmembers of the Fund. As the Ordinance has now  been\r\n\r\nin force for over seven years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is no longer any need for this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill deletes section 23 which\r\n\r\nbeing  transitional  is  no  longer  required.   It\r\n\r\nintroduces a new section which will enable money to\r\n\r\nbe  transferred to the Fund from private  provident\r\n\r\nfunds.  This  is considered necessary because  many\r\n\r\nprivate  provident funds make provisions  in  their\r\n\r\nrules  for such transfers to be made, but there  is\r\n\r\nat  present no provision in the Ordinance  enabling\r\n\r\nthe transfers to be accepted by the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill repeals section 24 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   in   regard   to   return   of   excess\r\n\r\ncontributions   and  inserts  in  its   place   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Rule 15 of the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\nRules.  This  new section will give  power  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard to retain certain monies paid in error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 25 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   to   enable  the   Minister   to   make\r\n\r\nregulations to extend the benefits of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nto   workers  whose  terms  of  employment  do  not\r\n\r\nconstitute  a contract of service or apprenticeship\r\n\r\nand to provide that when an employee is employed in\r\n\r\na   specified  employment  under  the  control   or\r\n\r\nmanagement  of a principal employer or  is  engaged\r\n\r\nand  paid  by a supplier of labour, such  principal\r\n\r\nemployer or supplier of labour shall be treated  as\r\n\r\nemployer  of  the  employee  and  liable   to   pay\r\n\r\ncontributions  for  him under the  Ordinance,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the employee may have an immediate employer\r\n\r\ndirectly  in control of him. This clause  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced in order that certain classes of  casual\r\n\r\nemployees  who at present do not have contributions\r\n\r\nmade for them are benefited by the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill amends the Schedule to the\r\n\r\nOrdinance by increasing the maximum amount of wages\r\n\r\nin  respect of which contributions are not  payable\r\n\r\nfrom  $10  to  $200.  The amendment  is  considered\r\n\r\nnecessary  as  a  result of the  amendment  whereby\r\n\r\ncontributions for an employee become liable as soon\r\n\r\nas he commences employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I raise\r\n\r\na  point  which  I  feel that the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nshould pay attention to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought up this point at the last sitting and\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance did not quite catch it.  I\r\n\r\nthought then that the women were trying to get  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  both worlds, but later on, in the  C.P.A.\r\n\r\nRoom,  when  I  explained it to  him,  he  actually\r\n\r\nthought that there was gross injustice there and he\r\n\r\npromised that something would be done about  it  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation. I did bring out the fact that\r\n\r\nit  is  very  dubious whether a  married  woman  in\r\n\r\nGovernment service after 15 years is pensionable or\r\n\r\nnot,  as  this may not apply to future  generations\r\n\r\nand  future employees. But there are a great number\r\n\r\nof  married  women who were in the  service  before\r\n\r\nparity or equal pay was given to women, and who are\r\n\r\nstill  in  the service, and this affects them,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  position is dubious. After they have  served\r\n\r\nfor  15 years and they retire, they will get three-quarters  of their pension and they will  therefore\r\n\r\nnot  be eligible for provident fund. But they  will\r\n\r\nhave to wait till they are 55 years old to withdraw\r\n\r\nwhatever money they have put in. On retirement, not\r\n\r\nonly  will  they have to wait for their money,  but\r\n\r\nwhatever gratuity or money they get from Government\r\n\r\nhas  to be used to pay back what Government has put\r\n\r\ninto  their  provident  fund.  Therefore,  such   a\r\n\r\nmarried  woman  is penalised, once, for  having  to\r\n\r\nsubscribe  to the provident fund when  she  is  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  draw  out her money  later  on,  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, to pay Government's share, and then  wait\r\n\r\ntill  several years more - she retires at 45 and  she\r\n\r\nhas to wait till she is 55 - to draw out not only her\r\n\r\nmoney,  but also the money she has to pay on behalf\r\n\r\nof the Government.

As\r\n\r\ntelecommunications will be a Federal subject  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  so will the Telegraphs Ordinance become  a\r\n\r\nFederal Ordinance.

Therefore, Singapore\r\n\r\nelected  representatives to the Federal  Parliament\r\n\r\nwill,  under  normal circumstances,  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  in  the  first  and  second\r\n\r\nMalaysian Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the preambles to the Singapore (Elections\r\n\r\nto  the  Federal  House  of Representatives)  Bill,\r\n\r\n1963,  states  that  it has  been  agreed  that  15\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House of Representatives should  be\r\n\r\nelected  from Singapore in such manner  as  may  be\r\n\r\ndetermined by the Legislature of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Malaysia Bill lays down that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  15 Members from Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse of Representatives. There will, therefore, be\r\n\r\nno  nomination of the 15 Members from  amongst  the\r\n\r\npresent Members of the Legislative Assembly.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be  elections  and those elected  will  serve\r\n\r\nuntil  the  second dissolution of Parliament  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 95 (2) of the Malaysia Bill also provides\r\n\r\nthat  the  delimitation  of constituencies  by  the\r\n\r\nElections  Commission will not apply to  the  first\r\n\r\nelections    of   Members   of   the    House    of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  from Singapore. This  delimitation\r\n\r\nof  constituencies  in connection  with  the  first\r\n\r\nelections will be under the provisions of section 8\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore  Legislative Assembly  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides for the election of these 15 Members and proposes that the manner and procedure of these elections shall follow that of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance with the amendments and modifications as set out in the Schedule to the\r\n\r\nBill.  Provision  is  also  made  to  empower   the\r\n\r\nMinister    to   make   further   amendments    and\r\n\r\nmodifications  to  the Rules and  Regulations  made\r\n\r\nunder  the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which  may  appear  necessary  for   the\r\n\r\npurpose of elections under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 of the Bill provides that the Ordinance\r\n\r\nshall come into operation on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch a day as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may  by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette appoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 provides that the elections should be\r\n\r\nheld at any time after the coming into operation of\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance, as decided by the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 refers to the manner and procedure of the\r\n\r\nelections which I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that the Electoral Registers\r\n\r\nprepared  under the Legislative Assembly  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance  shall  be  conclusive  evidence   of   a\r\n\r\nperson's  entitlement to vote at the  elections  to\r\n\r\nthe  House of Representatives of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. It also provides that where any electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions for the Federal elections consist of  two\r\n\r\nor  more  electoral  divisions  for  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  elections,  the   Electoral\r\n\r\nRegisters  in respect of the two or three electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions  for  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nelections  shall  together  be  deemed  to  be  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  division  for the Federal  elections.  A\r\n\r\nfurther  provision  in  this  clause  makes  it  an\r\n\r\noffence  for  any  person to vote  at  the  Federal\r\n\r\nelections in Singapore under this Bill if he is not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  vote under the Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  Elections Ordinance. A  person  can  vote\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  electoral division in  which  he  is\r\n\r\nregistered   as  an  elector.  As  I  have   stated\r\n\r\npreviously,  the  manner  and  procedure   of   the\r\n\r\nelections   shall  follow  that  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  Elections  Ordinance   with\r\n\r\namendments  and  modifications as set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule to the Bill. In the Schedule to the  Bill,\r\n\r\na  number of amendments and modifications contained\r\n\r\nin   the  Schedule  are  consequential  changes  to\r\n\r\ndefinitions arising from the elections taking place\r\n\r\nto  the  House of Representatives of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other amendments of which\r\n\r\nnote should be taken. One of the amendments set out\r\n\r\nto  the Schedule is the modification to section  47\r\n\r\n(4)  of the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance   which  provides  for  the  mixing   and\r\n\r\ncounting of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nballot   papers  contained  in  the  ballot   boxes\r\n\r\nrelating  to a Federal electoral division  or  such\r\n\r\npart  as the Returning Officer considers expedient.\r\n\r\nThis  provision enabling the Returning  Officer  to\r\n\r\ncount  any part of the ballot papers of the Federal\r\n\r\nelectoral   division  separately  would   make   it\r\n\r\npossible  for  him to count separately  the  ballot\r\n\r\npapers   for  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions which are grouped together  to\r\n\r\nform  part  of the Federal division, although  when\r\n\r\nthe  result is declared only the total figures  for\r\n\r\nthe  electoral  division will be  announced.  Under\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement, candidates will be able to  know\r\n\r\nhow  each  component Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nelectoral   division  forming  part  of   the   new\r\n\r\nelectoral  division voted. As the House is  already\r\n\r\naware,  the Government's intention is to group  the 51   Singapore   Legislative   Assembly   electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions into groups of threes and fours  to  form\r\n\r\neach new Federal division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to section 65 (1) provides for\r\n\r\nthe increase in election expenses from $6,000 or 50\r\n\r\ncents  per  elector, whichever is  the  larger,  as\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance, to $12,000 or  50  cents  per\r\n\r\nelector,  whichever is the larger. The increase  in\r\n\r\nthe   expenses  is  due  to  the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nelectorate for the Federal electoral divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made in the amendments and\r\n\r\nmodifications to section 73A for the  inclusion  of\r\n\r\nincreased powers of search by the police  where  it\r\n\r\nis  expected that canvassing is being conducted  by\r\n\r\nany person on polling day. Where a person enters or\r\n\r\nis  seen at more than two houses or places of  work\r\n\r\nof electors in the same polling district other than\r\n\r\nhis  own house or place of work on polling day,  he\r\n\r\nis   presumed  to  have  committed  an  offence  of\r\n\r\ncanvassing, unless the contrary is proved  by  him.\r\n\r\nThese  provisions  were included  in  the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance and it is considered desirable\r\n\r\nto include them in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further provision taken from the National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Ordinance  is  in  respect  of  persons\r\n\r\ndebarred  from taking part in election  activities.\r\n\r\nUnder this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision,  it  is an offence for  any  person  who\r\n\r\nattends  a primary or secondary school as a student\r\n\r\nor  a  person against whom an order has  been  made\r\n\r\nunder   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance or secret society activities to take part\r\n\r\nin  election activities. This provision is included\r\n\r\nin the Bill by way of modification to section 73c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will note that modifications are made to\r\n\r\nsections  57  (2)   and 73 (1) . These  two  sections\r\n\r\nrelate  to  the disqualifications of  persons  from\r\n\r\nbeing  either registered as electors or Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly when convicted of corrupt\r\n\r\nor  illegal  practices. While such persons  can  be\r\n\r\nconvicted  and  sentenced for  these  offences,  it\r\n\r\nfollows that any disqualifications arising  out  of\r\n\r\nthese  convictions  should be a  matter  under  the\r\n\r\nFederal  law, since these elections are in  respect\r\n\r\nof  membership  to the House of Representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the Schedule under this Bill, section\r\n\r\n79   is   deleted,  because  it  refers   only   to\r\n\r\ndisqualifications  of  elected   Members   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment to note is with regard to\r\n\r\nsection  94 (1)  which enables the Returning Officer\r\n\r\nto  use  free  of charge as a polling  station  any\r\n\r\nschool or part thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the House is aware, I have already given notice of amendments to the Schedule. At the Committee stage, I shall give reasons in detail for these amendments, but at this stage, I need only mention that the amendments refer to the qualifications of persons to be elected as Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House of Representatives of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia, the notification to be issued by  the\r\n\r\nMinister specifying Federal electoral divisions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for purposes of elections to the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives in the Federation of Malaysia,  and\r\n\r\nprovision    for   persons   conducting    election\r\n\r\nactivities   to   be  in  possession   of   written\r\n\r\nauthorities signed by candidates or their  election\r\n\r\nagent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the time is drawing near when elections will be held for the first time in Singapore for the people to choose their 15 representatives to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representatives  in  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and  it  is  very important  that  these\r\n\r\nelections  are carried out in a smooth,  effective,\r\n\r\nimpartial and efficient manner. This Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\nachieve  that objective by adopting, in  the  main,\r\n\r\nwith  a  few modifications, the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\ntime-tested  machinery and procedure laid  down  in\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Legislative  Assembly   Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\noppose the Bill, and my reasons are -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> One, we have not yet debated the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's motion on the Malaysia  Agreement - item  10  on the Order Paper. Until this has  been\r\n\r\nadopted - if  it  is  adopted -  the  question  of  the\r\n\r\nmanner of electing 15 Members to the Federal  House\r\n\r\nof  Representatives does not arise. The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  have arranged the order of business in  its\r\n\r\nproper  sequence, and the Second  Reading  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  should  rightly come after item 10  has  been\r\n\r\ndisposed  of.  The  Opposition  would  then  be  in\r\n\r\npossession  of  the  documents  relating   to   the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement, and it would be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to debate this Bill in the light  of  the\r\n\r\ndisclosures   that   can  be  gleaned   from   such\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, the second paragraph of the Preamble to the\r\n\r\nBill reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`AND WHEREAS it has been agreed that fifteen\r\n\r\nmembers  of the House of Representatives should  be\r\n\r\nelected  from Singapore in such manner  as  may  be\r\n\r\ndetermined by the Legislature of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong:'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I repeat, Sir, \"with the concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong\". I am not a lawyer, Sir, but  it  is\r\n\r\nmy  humble view that until after Malaysia Day, that\r\n\r\nis  the  31st of August, His Majesty the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  has  no constitutional  sovereignty\r\n\r\nover  Singapore, and I respectfully submit that  he\r\n\r\nhas  therefore  no constitutional  jurisdiction  to\r\n\r\nconcur. I do not say that I am right, but this is a\r\n\r\nmatter for constitutional experts to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvise.  I  cannot  help but recall  the  mess  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  in over the Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Bill. And\r\n\r\nbecause of this glaring example of the Government's\r\n\r\nlack of consultation of legal opinion, I would  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government to inform the House whether it  has\r\n\r\nreceived  advice  as  to  whether  or  not  it   is\r\n\r\nconstitutionally right for His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong to concur with the laws of Singapore\r\n\r\nbefore Malaysia Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is that a Certificate of Urgency\r\n\r\nhas  been introduced for the Second Reading of this\r\n\r\nBill.    This   is   indeed   very   strange    and\r\n\r\nunprecedented.  The  Second Reading  of  any  Bill,\r\n\r\nunless  introduced  on  a Certificate  of  Urgency,\r\n\r\ntakes its normal course under Standing Orders,  and\r\n\r\nunder  Standing Order 71 (3)  (a), \"... no amendment\r\n\r\nshall  be  proposed unless two clear  days'  notice\r\n\r\nthereof  has  been  given.\"  The  Government   have\r\n\r\nalready  given  notice of certain amendments  which\r\n\r\nthey  propose to move. On a Certificate of Urgency,\r\n\r\nhowever,  no notice need be given of any amendment,\r\n\r\nand  the  fact that the Government has  taken  this\r\n\r\nunprecedented step is an indication to us that some\r\n\r\nsurprise  amendments  are in their  bag  of  tricks\r\n\r\nwhich they may pull out, depending on the trend  of\r\n\r\nthe debate on the Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, under Standing Order 81, because of\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of a Certificate of Urgency,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  is deprived of any move  to  refer  the\r\n\r\nBill to a Select Committee. I charge the Government\r\n\r\nfor   wanting  to  play  out  the  Opposition   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the interests of the people.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nsuch  a Certificate of Urgency for a Second Reading\r\n\r\nis  not  necessary  as the Government  has  already\r\n\r\ngiven  notice  of  certain  amendments  which   the\r\n\r\nMinister  proposes  to  move during  the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his speech just now has said\r\n\r\nthat  it is only after the first elections  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament  that the statutory  autonomous\r\n\r\nElections  Commission in Kuala Lumpur will  operate\r\n\r\nin Singapore.

But he did not  say\r\n\r\nthat  whoever gets elected now under this  proposed\r\n\r\nlaw,  will remain until after the general elections\r\n\r\nto  the second Federal House of Representatives. It\r\n\r\nis not here. And we do not trust the P.A.P. because\r\n\r\nif  the  P.A.P. just get one man in -  \"All  right,\r\n\r\nelection  overnight.\" If they get twenty men  in  - \"Tidak apa lah, go to Kuala Lumpur and say, can  we\r\n\r\nmake it three terms instead of two terms?\" That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the P.A.P. are good for - twist and turn,  and\r\n\r\ncheat  as much as possible.

We\r\n\r\nhave  enough  evidence, and we do not  believe  the\r\n\r\nword  of  the  P.A.P. until we receive  documentary\r\n\r\nproof. We remember the Prime Minister when he  came\r\n\r\nback  as  a  great hero saying, \"Ah, we  give  them\r\n\r\nloans. It has been agreed that Singapore will  send\r\n\r\n50  per cent of workmen to the Borneo territories.\"\r\n\r\nStraightaway  there  was  a  denial  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister Designate of Sabah, saying, \"There has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  no  such agreement.\" And what did  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister say? \"Ah, semua (everything) is written at\r\n\r\nthe  back of an envelope.\" My God, the fate of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore at the back of an envelope! Now\r\n\r\nwe  ask where is the Malaysia Agreement? We want to\r\n\r\nsee  the  terms agreed upon for this representation\r\n\r\nto the Central Parliament. We have not seen it, but\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Home Affairs says, \"Until  after\r\n\r\nthe  second Federal Parliament.\" We do not  believe\r\n\r\nit.

Oh no, P.A.P. style,  run  down  the\r\n\r\nOpposition as much as you can!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sinister motive behind this is apparent\r\n\r\nto  us.  Why  is the Government so anxious  and  so\r\n\r\ndesperate  to hold these elections to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nHouse   of   Representatives  when  it   has   most\r\n\r\ndictatorially withheld the by-election in Sembawang\r\n\r\nfor  one  year?  God  rest the soul  of  Ahmad  bin\r\n\r\nIbrahim  -  a good man. The Sembawang seat  is  the\r\n\r\nmost vital as the strength in this Assembly of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the Opposition is evenly  divided.\r\n\r\nThe  success  or defeat of the P.A.P. candidate  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sembawang  by-election will  mean  either  the\r\n\r\nright  of  the  P.A.P. Government  to  continue  in\r\n\r\noffice  or that it has no moral right to  cling  to\r\n\r\noffice.   Why   has  the  Government   conveniently\r\n\r\nwithheld this vital by-election for a year, and  is\r\n\r\nnow  so anxious and desperate to hold elections  to\r\n\r\nthe Federal House of Representatives, the result of\r\n\r\nwhich  will  not  mean the fall of  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  the  P.A.P. fail to get  the  majority  of\r\n\r\nseats? The motive is clear. The P.A.P. are adopting\r\n\r\nthese  tactics to test the market.

Sir, the whole idea of this Bill\r\n\r\ntoday  is to allow the Government a chance to  hold\r\n\r\nsnap  elections,  and, what is more  important,  to\r\n\r\nallow  the Government to choose safe seats for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers   - of  course,  holding   snap\r\n\r\nelections,  taking advantage of us is  nothing  new  -  the  only question is, why they are doing this  so\r\n\r\nblatantly and openly, throwing away their  mask  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,   even  their  sense   of   fair   play,\r\n\r\neverything?  They just throw aside  everything  and\r\n\r\nnow  in  their desperate situation they are holding\r\n\r\non  to  any  straw, hoping thereby  to  give  their\r\n\r\nMinisters   a  chance  to  serve  in  the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on what the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nhas referred to. He has mentioned the fact that  in\r\n\r\nthe Preamble to the Bill it says that the manner of\r\n\r\nelections to the House of Representatives must have\r\n\r\nthe concurrence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to refer to that again, but I would  like\r\n\r\nto  refer to clause 2 which says that the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can at any time hold elections, that\r\n\r\nis,   at  any  time  the  P.A.P. decides  to  hold\r\n\r\nelections. If you will notice carefully,  Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthe amendments which the Government has put forward\r\n\r\nare  to  give the P.A.P. the chance to hold a  snap\r\n\r\nelection  in  order  to  place  Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\ncompletely at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 3 (2) it says that the Minister may at\r\n\r\nany    time    make   adaptations,   modifications,\r\n\r\namendments to the forms in the First Schedule. This\r\n\r\nmust  be  linked with the new amendment in page  5,\r\n\r\nline 6, which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) No person shall conduct any election activity\r\n\r\nunless  he  is in possession of a written authority\r\n\r\nsigned by a candidate or his election agent in  the\r\n\r\nForm 22 (A) or the Form 22 (B), as the case may be,\r\n\r\nin  the  First  Schedule to  this  Ordinance.  Such\r\n\r\nauthority ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, these are the important words - \"shall  be\r\n\r\nissued only on or after the day of nomination.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24 (2) of the Singapore Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly Elections (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance\r\n\r\nreads  - it  refers, first of all, to  the  writ  of\r\n\r\nelection being issued by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nand it follows in subsection (2):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every such writ shall be in the Form 1 in the\r\n\r\nFirst  Schedule to this Ordinance and shall specify\r\n\r\nthe  date or dates hereinafter referred to  as  the\r\n\r\nday  of  nomination not being less than 9 days  nor\r\n\r\nmore than one month after the date of the writ  and\r\n\r\nthe  place  or  places  of  nomination  hereinafter\r\n\r\nreferred to as the place of nomination.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, Sir, the day of writ to the day of\r\n\r\nnomination, will take 9 days. But elections can  be\r\n\r\nheld  from the day of writ to the day of poll,  all\r\n\r\nin  21 days. In fact, this period of 21 days can be\r\n\r\nfurther  reduced  even to 18 or  19  days.  I  have\r\n\r\nworked  in the Ministry of Home Affairs and I  know\r\n\r\nexactly  what the minimum period for elections  can\r\n\r\nbe.  It means that within three weeks from the  day\r\n\r\nof writ by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara,  general elections can take  place  or  any\r\n\r\nelections  can take place. If we take away  9  days\r\n\r\nfrom  the  day  of writ to the day  of  nomination,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be only 10 days or 12 days  left,  and\r\n\r\nwithin these 10 to 12 days, those who wish to  take\r\n\r\npart  in elections  - Parties or candidates - will have\r\n\r\nto  get their election agents; print their symbols;\r\n\r\nlook  for  places for election offices.  They  will\r\n\r\nhave to do all sorts of difficult things in a short\r\n\r\ncampaign  that will last only 10 days.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  will  thus  take  full  advantage - -unfair   advantage,  according  to  the   Alliance\r\n\r\nMembers - by playing out the Opposition according  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Lim Yew Hock -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown can locate the constituency\r\n\r\ncalled \"Lim Yew Hock\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government taking advantage of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nis  no surprise to us at all. But as I have already\r\n\r\nmentioned,  the  wonder  of  it  is  that,  in  its\r\n\r\ndesperation,  it  is ready to take  off  completely\r\n\r\ntheir mask and openly try to, legally again, as  in\r\n\r\nthe Referendum Ordinance, rig the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as everybody knows, the P.A.P. is making\r\n\r\nuse  of  the office of the Prime Minister to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General of the PAP, to  conduct  an\r\n\r\nelection campaign for the P.A.P. It has the use  of\r\n\r\nthe   radio,  television,  all  the  space  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  and everytime it talks of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- how good the P.A.P. is. But, of course, we can\r\n\r\ncome  to  debate  later on what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntoday  has been doing. Everybody knows that he  has\r\n\r\nsold out the rights and interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The   P.A.P. has  also   denied   the\r\n\r\nOpposition all opportunities of direct Contact with\r\n\r\nthe  masses.  For example, Sir, we in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  applied for a permit to hold a  rally  at\r\n\r\nPulau  Saigon two weeks ago. Last week  we  applied\r\n\r\nfor  a  permit to hold a rally in Bukit  Timah,  7\u00bd\r\n\r\nmilestone.  But on both occasions the  P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ndenied\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  the  right  of assembly. Not even a  registered\r\n\r\npolitical Party has the right of assembly  and  the\r\n\r\nright  of direct contact with the masses!  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  they mean when they talk of democracy  today.\r\n\r\nWhen they give reasons, they say it is because they\r\n\r\ndo  not  have enough policemen to guard  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. The next time they change their  tune.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure there will be more changing of tunes  very\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the Government intends to do,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  quite clear that the P.A.P. today  is\r\n\r\nopenly  intimidating not only  Assemblymen  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan. Sosialis but also all trade union leaders.\r\n\r\nIt  is taking away their citizenship and intimating\r\n\r\nthat  they might be put away, arrested. We are  not\r\n\r\nafraid  of these bankrupt P.A.P. politicians trying\r\n\r\nto cling on to straws in their last desperate gasp.\r\n\r\nThe  people's verdict will prove that it is a thing\r\n\r\nwhich they cannot fight against. They may make  use\r\n\r\nof  the  State power to hinder us in our work,  but\r\n\r\nthey  will  be struck off from the political  stage\r\n\r\nanyway, anyhow, soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the amendment which the P.A.P. seeks,\r\n\r\nnamely,  to  allow them to amend, adapt and  modify\r\n\r\nthose  forms and regulations in the First Scheduler\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. seeks to allow Opposition Members start\r\n\r\nthe  election  campaign only after nomination  day.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. hopes not only to take advantage of the\r\n\r\nfact that they know already the electoral divisions\r\n\r\nand  have everything prepared for the election  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  confuse and make more and more  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  Opposition Members and candidates to fight the\r\n\r\nelections. For example, Sir, new rules  can  be  so\r\n\r\nfixed  that even election agents may have to submit\r\n\r\nten   photographs  or  something   like   that   to\r\n\r\nGovernment before they can become election  agents,\r\n\r\nor  some such ridiculous things like this. But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the main reason behind this Bill is for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to get safe seats for P.A.P. Ministers.  You\r\n\r\nwill  remember,  Sir, in the referendum,  that  the\r\n\r\ncounting of votes was done in such a haphazard  way\r\n\r\nthat opposition counting agents were in no position\r\n\r\nto  know what was really happening. Today with that\r\n\r\nexperience  in mind they are hoping to  repeat  the\r\n\r\nsame performance. They want to count the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvotes  of  the various divisions and know how  many\r\n\r\nvotes  there are for the P.A.P. in each  particular\r\n\r\ndivision.  But the Opposition Members will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to have such knowledge. The P.A.P. wants to\r\n\r\nmix up all the ballot papers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You will be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and then, of course, nobody\r\n\r\nwill  really know except the P.A.P. The P.A.P. can\r\n\r\ncount  the number of votes in such a division,  and\r\n\r\nthen  the  Prime Minister will stand in a  division\r\n\r\nthat  is \"safe\". If not safe, then, of course,  the\r\n\r\nsecond-rate  Back-benchers,  the  third-rate  Back-benchers  will stand in them. That is exactly  what\r\n\r\nis  going to happen. The Back-benchers will have no\r\n\r\nhope  of getting safe seats for themselves. If they\r\n\r\nhave  a chance of standing again, they will be just\r\n\r\nstarters.  Just starters! That is all.  Even  their\r\n\r\nFront bench Ministers will also be starters anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Where do you start?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The start is, if at any time\r\n\r\nthey  tell  us where they want to go, we will  make\r\n\r\nsure of sending suitable opponents to topple all of\r\n\r\nthem. I do not wish to waste the time of the House,\r\n\r\nSir,  but we must realise that the whole object  of\r\n\r\nthis present Bill and the amendments thereto are to\r\n\r\nallow  the P.A.P. to seek an unfair advantage  over\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Parties and to allow the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nseek safe seats for their Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think we must\r\n\r\nnot  allow what the Member for Cairnhill  has  said\r\n\r\njust  now  to go by. He unfortunately has a  little\r\n\r\nobsession and he makes great pretence that he is  a\r\n\r\nscholarly lawyer trying to interpret Ordinances  at\r\n\r\na  time  when even lawyers are very quiet.  He  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now that this Bill makes  no  sense\r\n\r\nbecause  it mentions in the Preamble that  \"WHEREAS\r\n\r\nit  has  been  agreed that fifteen members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Representatives should be  elected  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  such manner as may be determined  by\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislature  of  Singapore with the concurrence  of\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Agong.\" Surely it will occur to\r\n\r\nhim  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in this  sense\r\n\r\nrepresents the Federation Government and that  this\r\n\r\nBill  is being introduced in this Legislature  with\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  of  the Federation  Government.  He\r\n\r\nfurther  says that by moving the Second  and  Third\r\n\r\nReadings  of this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition has no opportunity to  put  forward\r\n\r\namendments to this Bill. Members will remember that\r\n\r\nthis  Singapore (Elections to the Federal House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives) Bill was introduced  at  the  last\r\n\r\nsitting  of the Legislative Assembly, and  if  they\r\n\r\nreally  have  any  intention  or  desire  to   make\r\n\r\namendments  they  could have done so.  The  trouble\r\n\r\nwith  the  Opposition is that they have adopted  an\r\n\r\nattitude  that  whatever  the  Government  does  is\r\n\r\nalways  wrong.  They showed this  attitude  only  a\r\n\r\nlittle  while  ago.  When  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  expressed his willingness to withdraw  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)    (Amendment)   Bill,   because    the\r\n\r\nOpposition did not like it, they opposed  even  his\r\n\r\nattempt  to withdraw. They did not like  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nand yet they said to the Minister for Home Affairs,\r\n\r\n\"Thou shall not withdraw.\" It is just a lot of  hot\r\n\r\nair  and dust that has been generated by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  over this Bill. In reality,  as  he\r\n\r\nmust  admit, the Opposition is really reluctant  to\r\n\r\nface  the people and allow the people to choose  15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us be quite honest about Opposition\r\n\r\nattempts  to denigrate the Government and sneer  at\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of a majority on the Government benches.\r\n\r\nThey  had many times in the past an opportunity  to\r\n\r\noutvote  the Government on any important issue.  If\r\n\r\nwe  had been defeated on any decisive Bill - on  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  for  instance  - we  would  have   had   no\r\n\r\nalternative  but  to resign. Now, the  Opposition's\r\n\r\nreluctance to face the people, of course, is  quite\r\n\r\nunderstandable.  If we go to elections  either  for\r\n\r\nthe  15 seats or for the 51 seats, the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nstand on its record of achievements during the last\r\n\r\nfour years.

And  we  had\r\n\r\ncurious replies; not direct replies to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs, but replies in the Press.  Take\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. for  instance. Their Secretary-General\r\n\r\nfirst issued a statement that Tun Lim Yew Hock  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  represent  the S.P.A. at  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting;   the  Barisan  called  for  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting;  and  the U.P.P. called for  an  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting. Since the Minister for Home Affairs had no\r\n\r\nreplies  in  respect  of  their  proposals  on  the\r\n\r\ndelineation of 15 constituencies, he therefore sent\r\n\r\nout  another  letter inviting them to an  All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> Point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In connection with\r\n\r\nthe request by the Minister for Home Affairs to the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties to send representatives,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. replied to the effect that we did not wish\r\n\r\nto participate in the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I thank the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands for the information he has  given.\r\n\r\nHe  has  been  courteous enough  to  reply  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs directly and not  through\r\n\r\nthe Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying just now, when the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs invited the Opposition to an All-Party\r\n\r\nmeeting,  the excuse they gave was that  they  were\r\n\r\ngoing to be outvoted at this All-Party meeting  and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth, because there were going to be\r\n\r\nfive  P.A.P. representatives and  four  Opposition\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.

Let us\r\n\r\ndeal with this problem seriously. Do not let us  be\r\n\r\nfatuous about the whole business. I do not think we\r\n\r\nreally  want to ram it down the Opposition  throats\r\n\r\nthat the reason why they are opposing this Bill  is\r\n\r\nthat  they  are afraid to meet the people.  We  are\r\n\r\nresponsible people; we have a job to do; we have to\r\n\r\nlay  the  basis so that the people, the electorate,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore can find 15 qualified representatives\r\n\r\nwho  can  represent them in the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd  one  of  the reasons, I may add here,  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  oppose at all cost nominations direct  from\r\n\r\nthis Assembly is that some Members in this House do\r\n\r\nnot  qualify  for elections under the Federal  law,\r\n\r\nsimply   because   they   do   not   satisfy    the\r\n\r\nqualifications which are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has mentioned just now\r\n\r\nthat  we  really ought to have debated  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill after item 10, that is,  after\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia Agreement has been dealt with in this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Up to a point, he is correct, because  I\r\n\r\nthink  one  of  the points he has  raised  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate  is  that the 15 representatives  will  only\r\n\r\nhave a life of nine months or less than a year  as,\r\n\r\naccording to the Federal Constitution, the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament must dissolve in 1964. Therefore, if  we\r\n\r\nhave elections to the Federal Assembly now, we will\r\n\r\nprobably  face a second Federal election  in  1964.\r\n\r\nBut  as  the Minister for Home Affairs has informed\r\n\r\nthe House, this is not the case. It has been agreed\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation Government that the first  15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives who will represent Singapore in the\r\n\r\nFederal   House  of  Representatives   will   leave\r\n\r\nParliament  only at the second dissolution  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Parliament. In other words, if the Federal\r\n\r\nParliament\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be dissolved in 1964 and fresh elections are\r\n\r\nheld  in the Federation of Malaya, the 15 Singapore\r\n\r\nrepresentatives will continue to retain their seats\r\n\r\nin the second Malaysia Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I add that we are honest about\r\n\r\nholding  elections to the Malaysia Parliament?  Let\r\n\r\nme  reiterate that we would still like to open  the\r\n\r\ndoor to the Opposition, and if they so desire, they\r\n\r\ncan meet to discuss the broad basis on how these 15\r\n\r\nconstituencies should be drawn up. Let  it  not  be\r\n\r\nsaid in the future by any candidate who should lose\r\n\r\nin  these elections that all this has been  rigged.\r\n\r\nThat is a point which the Member for Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nbeen  trying to ram down our throats, that we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  twisting their tails and that  we  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying to rig the elections. If he is honest  about\r\n\r\nthis, let him accept our offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, because my colleague, the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim, is not feeling well today and is  unable\r\n\r\nto  take part in the debate, I rise on behalf of my\r\n\r\nParty to say a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government have introduced the Singapore (Elections to the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. It can be clearly seen by us that this Bill is equally dictatorial and undemocratic as the National Referendum Bill. This Bill gives the P.A.P. Minister full control of\r\n\r\nthe  elections. He will have the power to formulate\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations governing elections  without\r\n\r\ncoming  to  this Assembly. Actually, in so  far  as\r\n\r\nmatters of elections are concerned, the formulation\r\n\r\nof  rules  and  regulations should  lie  with  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, because elections are very important. But\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government are now trying to make use of\r\n\r\nundemocratic means to deprive this Assembly of  the\r\n\r\nright to make rules for the elections. They want to\r\n\r\ntransfer  all such powers to the Minister  so  that\r\n\r\nundemocratic  means  can  be  resorted  to  in  the\r\n\r\nelections  to  the Federal Parliament.  We  do  not\r\n\r\ntrust  or believe that the P.A.P. will be clean  in\r\n\r\nthe coming elections to the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the provisions of the White Paper,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Federal Parliament should be\r\n\r\nelected  under  the supervision of  an  independent\r\n\r\nElections  Commission. Why is it  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  refuse  to follow this  procedure?  Why\r\n\r\nmust   they   resort   to  this  undemocratic   and\r\n\r\ndictatorial  Bill to ensure that the Minister  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  power  to regulate the  election  of  15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to the Federal Parliament?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we know that the P.A.P. are not  confident\r\n\r\nof  winning the elections. They do not want to give\r\n\r\nthe Opposition a chance of being returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the delineation of the\r\n\r\nconstituencies, the P.A.P. again are not very fair.\r\n\r\nWe  are of the opinion that each Party should  send\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to attend an All-Party  conference\r\n\r\non  this matter. Even during the regime of the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew   Hock  Government,  democratic  methods   were\r\n\r\nadopted. If the P.A.P. are sincere about this, then\r\n\r\nafter  two  or  three  meetings  of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nconference, the problem could be solved. I hope the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will pay heed to my advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the delineation of constituencies was\r\n\r\ndone  on 1st June this year even before the request\r\n\r\nwas  made  to  the various Opposition  Parties.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  cover  up  their undemocratic  ways  and\r\n\r\ntactics,  the  P.A.P. put  up  the  pretext   that\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of other political Parties would be\r\n\r\nallowed in a conference to be held to consider  the\r\n\r\ndelineation   of  the  constituencies.   Only   one\r\n\r\nrepresentative of each Party was to be allowed, and\r\n\r\nthat  would  mean  four  representatives  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.   But  the  P.A.P. would   have   five\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  Where  is  the  democracy    - five\r\n\r\nagainst  four? All this is done to cover  up  their\r\n\r\nundemocratic acts. That is why all Parties  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition refused to attend this meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far back as 1st May this year, we heard that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. had already finalised arrangements  for\r\n\r\nthe  delineation  of  the constituencies.  We  also\r\n\r\nheard  that the constituencies of Geylang East  and\r\n\r\nMountbatten would be combined into one constituency\r\n\r\nfor   the   purpose  of  election  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.    In    this    particular    combined\r\n\r\nconstituency, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency   for  the  U.M.N.O. candidate   was\r\n\r\nexcluded to ensure that the U.M.N.O. representative\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  defeated.  So  the  P.A.P. is  now\r\n\r\nresorting  to  all sorts of undemocratic  means  to\r\n\r\nensure  that they would be returned to the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now trying to make use of public funds to\r\n\r\nhold  mass  rallies  during  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nvisits  to  the constituencies. In fact,  when  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  returned  from  London,  it   was\r\n\r\nreported  that  some  20,000  people  went  to  the\r\n\r\nAirport  to welcome him. The information I received\r\n\r\nwas that the P.A.P. hired about 50 S.T.C. buses  to\r\n\r\ngo  round the rural areas to drive the residents to\r\n\r\nthe  Airport. But, in fact, some buses  were  quite\r\n\r\nempty throughout the whole night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are trying to deprive my Party of its\r\n\r\nsymbol.  I  mentioned this during the  last  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate.  I  said to the Minister for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nthat  my Party symbol was approved by the Registrar\r\n\r\nof Societies and the Registrar of Trade Unions, and\r\n\r\nhe replied that there might be a possible confusion\r\n\r\nbetween my Party symbol and other emblems.  I  then\r\n\r\nsaid that my Party symbol was a unique three-circle\r\n\r\nsymbol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party also suggested that the elections should\r\n\r\nbe    conducted   by   an   independent   Elections\r\n\r\nCommission,  but the P.A.P. were not in  favour  of\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion. After some bargaining, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwere able to reach an agreement with the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the effect that the first  elections\r\n\r\nto  the  House  of Representatives  would  be  left\r\n\r\nentirely  in  the  hands of the  P.A.P.  Who  knows\r\n\r\nwhether, before these elections are conducted,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would  not  have a  desire  to  arrest  the\r\n\r\nprospective  candidates of the Opposition  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir own chances of being returned to the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  would greatly increase?  All  this\r\n\r\nthreat of foul play and undemocratic means will not\r\n\r\nfrighten  the people. In fact, the people will  see\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. is defeated. On 31st August, 1963,\r\n\r\nwhen   the   Central  Government  takes  over   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of elections and  the  police,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  lose all control over the  police.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this behaviour of the P.A.P. is  going  to\r\n\r\nbring about their own downfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it is not my intention to speak at  length\r\n\r\non  this matter.
