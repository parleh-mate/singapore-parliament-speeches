I  explained the two reasons for the sale.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  growth  in world trade and globalisation  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  economy  has  led  to  vast  changes  in  the  banking\r\n\r\nindustry.   Corporate and individual customers now  demand  a\r\n\r\nwide  range  of sophisticated services.  Increasingly,  banks\r\n\r\nare  evolving into financial supermarkets, and are no  longer\r\n\r\njust   deposit   takers  and  lenders.   These  developments,\r\n\r\ntogether  with the opening up of financial markets worldwide,\r\n\r\nhave  led  to  a  spate of mega-mergers, as banks  merge  and\r\n\r\nconsolidate  their strengths in order to remain  competitive.\r\n\r\nSize  has  become very important in the banking  sector.   It\r\n\r\nprovides  the  leverage  for the effective  cross-selling  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  products  and harnessing of  costly  technological\r\n\r\nchanges.   It also gives the banks the ability to reach  deep\r\n\r\ninto   a  range  of  markets  that  are  increasingly   being\r\n\r\nderegulated, and to take advantage of opportunities available\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin these markets.  Bigger banks are better placed to cater to\r\n\r\nthe  discerning  modern banking customers.  This  acquisition\r\n\r\nwould  therefore place DBS in a better position to  face  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive challenges that lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the acquisition would enable POSBank to better\r\n\r\nserve   its   increasingly   sophisticated   customers    and\r\n\r\ndepositors.  To meet competition from commercial banks and to\r\n\r\nretain its customer base, POSBank had to speed up the rate at\r\n\r\nwhich  it  was  growing its range of products  and  services.\r\n\r\nHowever,  organic growth on its own would be a  slow  process\r\n\r\nand  the  best way POSBank could grow quickly was to actively\r\n\r\nseek out complementarities with other banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y2K was not a reason why the Government sold POSBank.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  POSBank  had commenced its system  review  on  Y2K\r\n\r\ncompliance  prior to the sale and had plans to be Y2K  ready.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is confident that POSBank would have been Y2K\r\n\r\nready by 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister says\r\n\r\nthat  the  divestment was to better serve POSBank's customers\r\n\r\nbut  it does not appear to be the way things have turned out.\r\n\r\nThe  question really is that at that time of the  divestment,\r\n\r\ndid  the  Government envisage that there will be severe  cut-back  of  the services of POSBank by DBS?  And secondly,  why\r\n\r\nwas  DBS allowed to close bank branches when the existing DBS\r\n\r\ncomputer  system  could  not handle POSBank's  accounts?   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  it appears to be very poor planning  that  was\r\n\r\nvery badly implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Government is in no position\r\n\r\nto tell DBSBank what it should do with the purchase.  When  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that the sale will make it better for the combined bank\r\n\r\nto   service  its  customers,  I  mean  to  serve  its   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  customers.  The bulk  of  POSBank's  customers\r\n\r\nwere   small  customers,  together  with  a  group  of  large\r\n\r\ndepositors.  This structure, it was foreseen, could not  last\r\n\r\nmuch longer because it was losing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney of its large depositors to other commercial banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the quality of the service which POSBank has been\r\n\r\nable  to  render post merger, I believe DBS Bank has  already\r\n\r\nmade  public  statements on its services.  The Member  should\r\n\r\nask  DBS  directly if more information is needed  or  put  in\r\n\r\nanother question on this particular issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, Government is appropriately\r\n\r\nrepresented at DBS Bank, especially at the board level, is it\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is a commercial bank.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   last  year,  the  Home  Team  arrested  about   16,500\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders, comprising both illegal immigrants and\r\n\r\noverstayers.  This represents a 3% decrease compared  to  the\r\n\r\n17,000  immigration offenders arrested in  1999,  and  a  28%\r\n\r\ndecrease   compared  to  the  23,000  immigration   offenders\r\n\r\narrested in 1998.  While the situation has improved over  the\r\n\r\npast  three  years, the figure last year is still 18%  higher\r\n\r\nthan  the 14,000 arrested in 1997.  The immigration offenders\r\n\r\narrested  came  from all over the region, mainly  Bangladesh,\r\n\r\nChina  and  India.   The  immigration  offender  problem   is\r\n\r\ntherefore still a serious one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for harbourers and employers, there has been an\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of arrests over the last three  years.\r\n\r\nLast   year,   590   people  were  arrested  for   harbouring\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders, compared to 306 in 1999  and  166  in\r\n\r\n1998.   572  people  were arrested for employing  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.   This  is  an  increase over  the  388  employers\r\n\r\narrested in 1999 and the 270 arrested in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 10 housing agents arrested last year for\r\n\r\nabetting to harbour immigration offenders, compared to  three\r\n\r\nin 1999 and one in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, if I\r\n\r\nheard  the  numbers  correctly, it seems that  employers  are\r\n\r\nrelatively few, 572, but the number of landlords seems to  be\r\n\r\nquite  high.  Is it not clear that people will only  overstay\r\n\r\nif  they had a job and therefore should we not do more  about\r\n\r\nthe  employers?  Secondly, the number of agents  arrested  is\r\n\r\n10.   Is  that not stunningly low compared to the number  for\r\n\r\nlandlords?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the first point on the\r\n\r\nrelativity  of  the figures, the figures are  in  fact  quite\r\n\r\nclose.   Because for last year, 590 people were arrested  for\r\n\r\nharbouring  immigration offenders whereas 572, just  slightly\r\n\r\ndown  by  18  people, were arrested for employing immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.  I agree with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Tay that we have to attack the problem on both fronts.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we have made it very clear that we treat each category\r\n\r\nof  people  with  the same approach in terms  of  enforcement\r\n\r\naction.  This has been done.  SIR, together with MOM, carries\r\n\r\nout  enforcement raids at places where immigration  offenders\r\n\r\nmay  be working or places where they are gathering.  In terms\r\n\r\nof  the  law too, they are of the same parity.  So under  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act, an employer who is prosecuted  and  charged\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  with  employing an  immigration  offender  also\r\n\r\nfaces   the   minimum  mandatory  six  months'  imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if  he engages or employs more than five immigration\r\n\r\noffenders, he also faces mandatory caning.  So there  are  no\r\n\r\ntwo  ways about it.  As I have said, concerted actions on all\r\n\r\nfronts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for agents, the current law is such that when agents\r\n\r\nare  charged, they are charged under the abetment  provision.\r\n\r\nWe  have  announced  in this House that  we  are  looking  at\r\n\r\nchanging  the law so that the agents will also have  to  face\r\n\r\nthe  same requirement of due diligence.  After all, they  may\r\n\r\nbe  the  ones who are in touch with the immigration offender.\r\n\r\nWith  the due diligence requirement of the harbourer  or  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  the agents will be subject to the same  standards.\r\n\r\nSo the low numbers are because of this fact, because they are\r\n\r\ncharged  for  abetment and for abetment  you  have  to  prove\r\n\r\nknowledge.  That is more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nrecently  it  was reported in the press that  a  few  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, including a newly-born baby, were arrested  in  a\r\n\r\nmakeshift shelter, actually a storm drain.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  of State whether such  developments,  ie,\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  going literally underground,  are  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  tougher  stance taken  by  the  Ministry  on\r\n\r\nharbourers   of   illegal   immigrants   and   whether   such\r\n\r\ndevelopments were anticipated by the authority.  Although  we\r\n\r\nunderstand the rationale for the Government's action, I would\r\n\r\nlike to know whether the Ministry has considered the hardship\r\n\r\nbefallen  such economic refugees as a result of  the  tougher\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think we should be\r\n\r\ncareful about this because it is a serious problem.  So  when\r\n\r\nwe  look at the whole situation and make it more onerous  for\r\n\r\nharbourers to harbour illegal offenders, one consequence will\r\n\r\nbe  the fact that it would be more difficult for them to find\r\n\r\naccommodation.   That actually explains  why  in  the  months\r\n\r\nafter  the  enhanced  publicity,  more  were  caught.    More\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were also reporting them.  This is  an  extreme\r\n\r\ncase  where this immigration offender was found with a child.\r\n\r\nIn  other  cases,  yes, they will have some  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nfinding  accommodation and finding employment.  But  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the law.  So that also  sends  a  deterrent\r\n\r\nmessage  to other people who will know that if they  come  in\r\n\r\nillegally, they face difficulties.  And at the same time, the\r\n\r\nfact that they have to come out from their quarters, and some\r\n\r\nwill  hide  in the forest, that will also enable the  Police,\r\n\r\ntogether with MOM and other agencies, to catch them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> I will come back to the point\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr Simon Tay that the number of employers  arrested\r\n\r\nappears very disproportionate to the number of harbourers  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants arrested.  If so, if your Ministry  agrees\r\n\r\nto  this  fact, whether tougher action will be taken  against\r\n\r\nemployers of illegal immigrants?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think it must be so\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore is porous, so immigration offenders  come.\r\n\r\nSo   the  numbers  are  large.   It  must  be  so  that  more\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders are caught than the employers  because\r\n\r\nthe  places  where  they  work in  Singapore  would  be  more\r\n\r\nlimited.  But, as I have said, the focus of the law  is  also\r\n\r\non the employers and the law is already very harsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDIA WATCH COUNCIL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Formation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S.

MITA consults the PAC\r\n\r\non publication content that may have breached our guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe  PAC  reflects the views of the public and helps MITA  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the quality of publications in Singapore.

Second,  are\r\n\r\nthe  PAC  and the Ministry actually quite satisfied with  the\r\n\r\nveracity and guidelines of good judgement and morality  shown\r\n\r\nby the new newspapers, particularly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  receives very few complaints from  the  public\r\n\r\nabout  the  newspapers.

The\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Statistics (DOS) has studied this  matter  and\r\n\r\nfound  that  GLCs  contribute just 12.9% to  our  GDP.   This\r\n\r\nrefers  to  companies  where  the  Singapore  Government  has\r\n\r\neffective  voting shares of 20% or more.  In  contrast,  MNCs\r\n\r\nplay a much bigger role, accounting for 42% of our GDP.

For  example, Singapore was ranked  8th  in  the\r\n\r\nStartup Index of the 2000 Global Competitiveness Report.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of new companies registered yearly have also been  on\r\n\r\nthe  rise, with the number registered in the 2000 up 16% from\r\n\r\nfive years earlier, and 70% compared to 1990.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to ensure that our markets\r\n\r\nremain  open and competitive, and that the playing  field  is\r\n\r\nlevel  for  all companies.  It is not Government's policy  to\r\n\r\nfavour  GLCs and, if there are valid criticisms, we will  act\r\n\r\non  them.  In fact, the Government is reviewing its rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  to  make sure that these rules  and  regulations\r\n\r\nfacilitate,  and not inhibit, private enterprise,  especially\r\n\r\nfor the New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: should we reverse-discriminate against\r\n\r\nGLCs  in Singapore in order to favour private companies?   If\r\n\r\nwe  do  this, Singapore consumers will lose out.  As long  as\r\n\r\ntheir practices are competitive, we should not force GLCs out\r\n\r\nof  the  local market.

Last year, our economy outperformed expectations\r\n\r\nand  grew  by  9.9%, a rate not exceeded  since  1994.   [The\r\n\r\neconomic growth rate in 1994 was 11.4%.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sectors enjoyed higher growth in 2000. In\r\n\r\nparticular, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade grew by\r\n\r\na  strong 15%. Financial and business services rebounded from\r\n\r\nmarginal  growth in 1999, to 4.1% and 6.6% respectively.  The\r\n\r\ncontraction of the construction sector\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued, but was less severe than that in 1999, and  showed\r\n\r\nsigns of reversal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong external demand was the cause of growth. The\r\n\r\nworld  economy is estimated to have expanded by 4.7% in 2000,\r\n\r\nthe  highest growth rate in 12 years.  In particular, the  US\r\n\r\neconomy  was  the  key  driver  behind  global  demand.   The\r\n\r\nbursting  of  the  dot-com bubble did not stop  the  US  from\r\n\r\nregistering a stellar growth of 5.0% last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics, which was a major engine for the recovery\r\n\r\nin  1999,  continued to take centre-stage  in  2000.   Global\r\n\r\nsemiconductors sales surged by a remarkable 31%, up from  19%\r\n\r\nin  1999.  This gave our manufacturing sector a strong boost,\r\n\r\nwith major downstream benefits for many other sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year 2000 was also a great year for investment\r\n\r\npromotion.  Manufacturing investment  commitments  reached  a\r\n\r\nrecord  $9.2  billion.  Many of these were in key  knowledge-intensive   industries  like  pharmaceuticals  and   high-end\r\n\r\nelectronics  that  will position us well for  future  growth.\r\n\r\nEDB  also  secured  $1.9  billion  of  commitments  in  total\r\n\r\nbusiness  spending  for  services  last  year.   Against  the\r\n\r\nuncertain  political  environment  in  Southeast   Asia   and\r\n\r\ncompetition  from  China,  the  achievements  of   EDB   were\r\n\r\nespecially remarkable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job market benefited from the strong economic growth\r\n\r\nin  2000. More than 110,000 jobs were created, far surpassing\r\n\r\nthe  40,000  in 1999. Retrenchments tailed off, falling  from\r\n\r\n14,600  in  1999  to  11,500 last year.   As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nseasonally-adjusted  unemployment  rate  fell  to   2.8%   in\r\n\r\nDecember 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strong economic performance was due not only to\r\n\r\nfortuitous  external  developments, but  also  to  our  sound\r\n\r\neconomic  policies  and the hard work of  Singaporeans.  Full\r\n\r\ncredit  should go to our workers, who have patiently  put  up\r\n\r\nwith the CPF cut. This was instrumental in retaining investor\r\n\r\nconfidence and enabling our industries to stay globally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  as  we rode out the Asian economic  crisis.  In\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the strong growth, another 4%age points  have\r\n\r\nbeen  restored to the employers' CPF contribution  rate  last\r\n\r\nmonth, bringing it to 16%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while our overall economic performance was very\r\n\r\ngood,  not all businesses benefited. Besides the construction\r\n\r\nsector,  some  industries like wood and paper  products,  and\r\n\r\nretail  segments  such as watch, jewellery and  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshops,  did  not do well. Many SMEs were not able to  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the  strong global demand.  The robust growth was  also\r\n\r\nnot  reflected in the asset markets. The STI ended 22%  lower\r\n\r\nlast  year, while the residential property price index dipped\r\n\r\n1.0%.\r\n\r\nOutlook for 2001\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot repeat the exceptional performance of 2000\r\n\r\nthis  year.  While the overall outlook for 2001 remains fair,\r\n\r\nwe must be prepared for slower growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External economic prospects have become less rosy. The\r\n\r\nUS  economy  has decelerated quite sharply in  the  past  few\r\n\r\nmonths. Poorer corporate results and weak stock markets  have\r\n\r\nbegun  to  feed through to slower consumption and investment.\r\n\r\nThe  chances of a hard landing have increased, prompting  the\r\n\r\nFederal Reserve to cut interest rates by 100 basis points  so\r\n\r\nfar  this  year.  The consensus is that the US  economy  will\r\n\r\ngrow by only 2 to 2.5% this year.  But if it turns out lower,\r\n\r\nwe will be in for harder times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese economy is expected to remain weak this\r\n\r\nyear.  In  fact, its recovery is beginning to show  signs  of\r\n\r\nstalling. Household expenditure has remained anaemic  due  to\r\n\r\njob  worries  and continuing deflation. Japanese exports  are\r\n\r\nalready slowing on the back of weaker US demand. These  could\r\n\r\nin turn dampen business investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, growth in Europe should be able to provide\r\n\r\nsome  support  for  the  slowing external  demand.   Although\r\n\r\ngrowth in Europe peaked last year, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  remain  healthy at about 3% in 2001,  underpinned  by\r\n\r\nrobust consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, global electronics demand will moderate from\r\n\r\nits  stellar  growth  of last year.  Some  industry  watchers\r\n\r\nexpect sales of semiconductors to slow significantly from the\r\n\r\nheady  31%  growth  last year to just 5-10%  this  year.  But\r\n\r\ncontinued  healthy  demand  in  segments  such  as  PCs   and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  products will provide  some  support  for\r\n\r\ngrowth in the electronics sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowdown in the US economy and electronics demand\r\n\r\nwill affect the region. While Asia has, by and large, bounced\r\n\r\nback from the crisis, it has not yet been nursed back to full\r\n\r\nhealth. Asian banking systems remain weak, and there is still\r\n\r\nmuch  restructuring to be done. In several  Asian  countries,\r\n\r\ninternal political problems add to their complications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep a close watch on the dark clouds looming\r\n\r\nin  the  horizon. But there is no ground for excessive gloom.\r\n\r\nDomestically, the composite leading index continues to  point\r\n\r\nto growth ahead.  The business expectations survey shows that\r\n\r\nfirms  in the financial services, catering and hotel segments\r\n\r\nexpect  business  to  improve in the  next  6  months.  While\r\n\r\nmanufacturers have turned cautious about growth prospects  in\r\n\r\nthe  next 6 months, the new plants coming on stream this year\r\n\r\nin  the  electronics, chemicals and life sciences  industries\r\n\r\nwill  help  to buttress growth.  The construction  sector  is\r\n\r\nalso  bottoming out and looks set to register positive growth\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the global economy is likely to become more\r\n\r\nvolatile,   we   are  well  positioned  to   ride   out   the\r\n\r\nfluctuations.   Our restructuring efforts and upgrading  over\r\n\r\nthe  years  have paid off and we now have a more  diversified\r\n\r\nand  resilient economy. We have a strong manufacturing sector\r\n\r\nand  a  good  spectrum  of  thriving services.  Our  domestic\r\n\r\nexports are fairly well spread out among the major markets of\r\n\r\nUnited  States, European Union and Asia.  Although we have  a\r\n\r\ndominant electronics sector, we are steadily building up  our\r\n\r\nchemicals cluster. Even within electronics,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere   is   strong   diversification.   Semiconductors   and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  equipment  have  emerged  as  new  growth\r\n\r\ndrivers,  as  our  production share of disk  drives  and  PCs\r\n\r\ndeclines. The external wing of our economy is firming up  and\r\n\r\nregionalisation efforts are paying off.  Income  from  abroad\r\n\r\nhas  risen  by more than 8% on average for each year  between\r\n\r\n1990  and  2000.  This  provides a  supplementary  source  of\r\n\r\nearnings for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this broad and robust economic base which has\r\n\r\nenabled   us  to  emerge  from  the  Asian  economic   crisis\r\n\r\nrelatively  unscathed. In fact, in relative  terms,  we  have\r\n\r\ncome  out of the Asian crisis stronger and are able to  start\r\n\r\nthe  new  millennium  on a solid footing.  With  this  year's\r\n\r\nbudget,  the  Government  will  continue  to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nupgrading and restructuring of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year, taking all factors into account, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry forecasts a growth of 5 to 7%.\r\n\r\nBut  if the external environment turns for the worse, it  can\r\n\r\nhave  a substantial impact on our growth, given our very open\r\n\r\neconomy.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>PART II THE FY2001 BUDGET</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move on now to the Budget for Fiscal\r\n\r\nYear 2001.\r\n\r\nFY 2000 BUDGET OUTTURN\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I do so, I would first like to recap on the\r\n\r\nFY2000  Budget  and  touch on changes  made  to  improve  the\r\n\r\npresentation of the Budget in the Budget Book.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I presented the FY2000 Budget to the House last\r\n\r\nyear,  operating revenue was estimated at $31.4  billion  and\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure at $29 billion, yielding a budget  surplus\r\n\r\nof $2.4 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, last year's GDP growth of 9.9% exceeded all\r\n\r\nexpectations. As a result, revenue growth has turned out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be much stronger. On the other hand, total expenditure is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be about $1 billion lower at $28  billion.  The\r\n\r\nlower  expenditure  is  due to reduced development  spending,\r\n\r\npartly  offset by unforeseen compensation payments to Singtel\r\n\r\nand   Starhub.  In  addition,  last  year,  Government   also\r\n\r\nannounced  several  surplus sharing measures  totalling  $1.8\r\n\r\nbillion which included the CPF Top-up, the Medishield  Scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the Elderly and contributions to the Eldercare Fund  and\r\n\r\nthe Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account all these changes, a budget surplus\r\n\r\nof  $3.5  billion is now forecast for FY2000.  However,  this\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus cannot be directly compared with the forecast\r\n\r\nmade in February last year because of several changes made to\r\n\r\nthe presentation of the FY2000 budget. I will now explain the\r\n\r\nrationale underlying these changes.\r\n\r\nCHANGES TO THE BUDGET PRESENTATION\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, I moved the Constitutional\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill to require the Government to protect at  least\r\n\r\n50%  of  the Net Investment Income (or NII) earned from  past\r\n\r\nreserves. The issue of whether or not to protect NII was  one\r\n\r\nthat the Government has carefully considered for a long time.\r\n\r\nPreviously, NII used to accrue fully to current reserves  and\r\n\r\nwas all spendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of operating revenue has since been\r\n\r\nchanged to include a new item called \"NII Contribution\". This\r\n\r\nis the portion of NII that is available for the government-of-the-day to spend. NII now also incorporates interest earnings\r\n\r\nfrom developmental loans which have been classified under the\r\n\r\nitem   \"Others\".  The  item  \"Others\"  is  consequently  much\r\n\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also reclassified expenditure on land\r\n\r\nreclamation projects. These are projects which help to  build\r\n\r\nup  the  nation's  land  bank for long-term  use.  They  were\r\n\r\npreviously  funded as development expenditure  using  current\r\n\r\nrevenues. This arrangement could be a disincentive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  future governments to take on such projects as  benefits\r\n\r\nwould only accrue in the long term. While this Government has\r\n\r\nnot  shrunk from carrying out reclamation projects, we should\r\n\r\nmake changes to address this potential problem to ensure that\r\n\r\nsuch   projects   continue  to  be   undertaken   by   future\r\n\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land reclamation should be viewed as a long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment.  From  FY 2001, expenditures on land  reclamation\r\n\r\nwill  be  funded from capital receipts from land sales.  Such\r\n\r\nexpenditures  are reflected as land-related  expenditures  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget Book.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the changes I have outlined above,\r\n\r\nrefinements   have   also   been   made   to   the   sectoral\r\n\r\nclassification of ministries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nhas  been shifted to the newly renamed \"Security and External\r\n\r\nRelations\" sector, while Ministry of National Development has\r\n\r\nbeen  transferred to the \"Social Development\"  sector.  These\r\n\r\nchanges  have been made to better reflect the main  functions\r\n\r\nof  the  two  ministries.  For the same  reason,  the  sector\r\n\r\n\"General   Services\"   has  also  been  renamed   \"Government\r\n\r\nAdministration\".\r\n\r\nENTERING THE NEW MILLENNIUM: A PLACE FOR EVERYONE\r\n\r\nObjectives of the Budget\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the FY2001 Budget proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget time is a time to take stock of the economy and\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  work in the past year.  This  year  is  an\r\n\r\nespecially  opportune time to look back and see  how  far  we\r\n\r\nhave come, as well as look forward to where we are headed for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 35 years, the Singapore economy has\r\n\r\nundergone  many changes, as we continually adjust  to  global\r\n\r\nconditions in search of sustained economic growth. Because of\r\n\r\nthe  hard work, enterprise and unity of all Singaporeans,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to seize new growth opportunities  as  they\r\n\r\npresent themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have created a resilient and prosperous economy that  has\r\n\r\nweathered many storms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the new millennium ushers in a new age in which\r\n\r\nideas,  knowledge and talent are the main drivers of  growth.\r\n\r\nIt  is an era where it is the economies that are best able to\r\n\r\ngenerate  and  attract wealth-creating ideas,  knowledge  and\r\n\r\npeople that will succeed. Therein lies great opportunity  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  -  a  country whose greatest  advantages  are  its\r\n\r\npeople,  and  its connectivity to the rest of the  world.  By\r\n\r\npositioning  ourselves  as  a  knowledge-based  economy,  and\r\n\r\nleveraging on our strengths, we can ride the waves of change,\r\n\r\nand continue to lift living standards in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as in the past, the Government and people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  must come together and make the necessary  changes\r\n\r\nto  our  economy, to ensure that Singapore remains  the  best\r\n\r\nhome for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we make these adjustments to anticipate and\r\n\r\nembrace  global  trends and changes, we must continue  to  be\r\n\r\nmindful of our local context: those who can run faster should\r\n\r\npave  the  way  for  the  rest; however,  those  who  may  be\r\n\r\nunwittingly left behind must not be left with no help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realises that realignments of our economy\r\n\r\nhave  often meant displacement of jobs, or even disappearance\r\n\r\nof industries, but for every door closed, we have opened many\r\n\r\nothers, leading to greater opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that it is not easy for workers to\r\n\r\ncontinually  learn new skills and work in a new  environment,\r\n\r\nor  for  enterprises to quickly change direction  and  pursue\r\n\r\nbusiness  prospects in new areas.  It takes a great  deal  of\r\n\r\ncourage  to  embrace  changes, and take  the  steps  to  walk\r\n\r\nthrough  new  doors  of  opportunity.  The  transition  often\r\n\r\nentails adjustments which are sometimes painful. But we  want\r\n\r\nto help. We want to lessen the hardship for those who find it\r\n\r\ndifficult to adapt to the changes.  But change we must.   And\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the  day,  we have  to  ensure  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  a  place  in  the  Singapore  of  the   new\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrusts of this year's budget are therefore: at\r\n\r\nthe  macro  level, to position Singapore for  a  new  era  of\r\n\r\ngrowth,   by  increasing  our  attractiveness  not  only   to\r\n\r\nbusinesses  as a place to invest in, but also to  individuals\r\n\r\nas  a place to live and work in.  And at the micro level,  to\r\n\r\ngive  every individual worker the wherewithal to weather this\r\n\r\ndifficult  but  necessary period of transition  to  this  new\r\n\r\nstage  of  economic  growth,  to  assist  promising  business\r\n\r\nenterprises in getting established, and to help businesses in\r\n\r\ndying trades shift out to other industries.\r\n\r\nProjected FY2001 Fiscal Position\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the FY2001 fiscal position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue for FY2001 is estimated at $34.3\r\n\r\nbillion,  including  a  $0.9 billion contribution  from  NII.\r\n\r\nOperating and development expenditures are budgeted at  $18.7\r\n\r\nbillion  and $9.4 billion respectively. Total expenditure  in\r\n\r\nFY2001  thus  comes to $28.1 billion. Special transfers  will\r\n\r\ntotal $1.9 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these projections of revenue, expenditure and\r\n\r\nspecial  transfers,  a budget surplus of  $4.4  billion  [The\r\n\r\nfigures  are  rounded to one decimal point.] is expected  for\r\n\r\nFY2001. Once again, we are in the happy position of having  a\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus. Having a surplus allows us to take  measures\r\n\r\nto  enhance our competitiveness, share with Singaporeans  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of the nation's success, and at the same time add  to\r\n\r\nour reserves.\r\n\r\nExpenditure Priorities\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest share of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  FY2001 expenditure budget goes  to  the  Social\r\n\r\nDevelopment  sector,  which  accounts  for  43.4%  of   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Education,  Health, Community  Development  and\r\n\r\nSports, Information and the Arts and Public Housing will  all\r\n\r\nget  substantial increases in their budget allocation.  These\r\n\r\nincreases are in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline with the Government's policy of educating the young, and\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  people's welfare, health,  cultural  and\r\n\r\nhousing needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector is the Security and External\r\n\r\nRelations sector. We will continue to invest heavily  in  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of our nation and in building warm ties with  other\r\n\r\ncountries. Although this sector takes up 36.6% of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure budget, it is money well spent, for without peace\r\n\r\nand  security,  we would not have secure homes  and  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Development is the third largest sector. This\r\n\r\nsector  takes  up 15.0% of the total expenditure  budget.  It\r\n\r\nrepresents   our   continued  investment  in  infrastructure,\r\n\r\ncreation   of   new  economic  activities  and  comprehensive\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Administration sector remains the\r\n\r\nsmallest  sector,  comprising 5.0% of the  total  expenditure\r\n\r\nbudget. We will continue to keep this the smallest sector  as\r\n\r\nour  policy is to keep central administration small  and  let\r\n\r\noperational ministries have the bulk of the resources.\r\n\r\nPOSITIONING SINGAPORE FOR THE NEW ERA OF GROWTH\r\n\r\nCreating a Framework to Stay Competitive\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas and entrepreneurial spirit of individuals and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are  the  foundation of our  new  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy. Innovation and enterprise will be the key drivers of\r\n\r\nthis   new   economy.  More  than  ever  before,  positioning\r\n\r\nourselves for the future can only be done in a broad  way  at\r\n\r\nthe  national  level. Ultimately, it is up to  companies  and\r\n\r\nindividuals to identify specific commercial opportunities and\r\n\r\nthreats and respond accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can and will do, however, is to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  ensure  an  environment that  is  pro-business,\r\n\r\nencourages  individual effort and the drive  for  innovation,\r\n\r\nand facilitates the blossoming\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  new ideas. At the same time, the Government will continue\r\n\r\nto  create  the  conditions to attract  and  retain  talented\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  foreigners to live in  and  contribute  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest World Competitiveness Yearbook ranking, we\r\n\r\nretained  our  overall standing as the  world's  second  most\r\n\r\ncompetitive  economy after the United States.  We  were  also\r\n\r\nranked  the  country  that  was  best-adapted  for  long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,   and  the  economy  whose   companies   and\r\n\r\nGovernment take the shortest time to adapt to changes in  the\r\n\r\neconomic cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rather than making us rest on our laurels,\r\n\r\nthese  positive showings in international rankings must  spur\r\n\r\nus  on  to  keep  up and not fall back. The global  challenge\r\n\r\ndemands  continuous effort.  Country after country is pushing\r\n\r\non,  reducing taxes to be more competitive, cutting  back  on\r\n\r\nsocial expenditure they can no longer sustain, all wishing to\r\n\r\nbuild the next Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies such as that by the Political and Economic Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy Ltd., or PERC, have pointed out that one critical\r\n\r\narea for improvement is the quality of manpower. We recognise\r\n\r\nthat  human capital will be our competitive edge for our next\r\n\r\nphase  of  economic development.  We must develop  our  human\r\n\r\ncapital pool to the fullest.\r\n\r\nEducation and Training\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for Singapore to succeed in our next phase of\r\n\r\neconomic  development, we will require a  different  type  of\r\n\r\nworkforce   -  one that is able to acquire, apply and  create\r\n\r\nknowledge in flexible and innovative ways to generate greater\r\n\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the jobs that Singapore expects to create in 10\r\n\r\nto  15  years, we require a workforce where 65% have at least\r\n\r\npost-secondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as of 1999, only 35% of our workforce have post-secondary education or higher. There is thus a risk of\r\n\r\nworkers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  structurally displaced if they do not upgrade or learn\r\n\r\nnew skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is addressing this issue through a multi-pronged approach. First, we will continue to invest heavily\r\n\r\nin education to ensure that new entrants to the workforce are\r\n\r\nwell-equipped  to meet the challenges of the new  millennium.\r\n\r\nOur  students must be equipped with the right skill sets  for\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  age,  which include creativity  and  critical\r\n\r\nreasoning  skills.  For this, the Ministry  of  Education  is\r\n\r\nallocated  a  budget  of  $6.3 billion,  the  second  largest\r\n\r\namongst all the ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will also be spending more than $30 million\r\n\r\non  the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme (or MDAS)  and\r\n\r\nother  initiatives that will help everyone in  the  workforce\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills and knowledge continuously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to promote lifelong learning, Government has set\r\n\r\nup  the  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund announced  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  last August. The Government is  contributing\r\n\r\nthe first $500 million to the fund in FY 2000. I am happy  to\r\n\r\nannounce  that  the Government will contribute  another  $500\r\n\r\nmillion to the Fund in FY2001. This will bring the Fund to $1\r\n\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will equip our workers with the skills to take on\r\n\r\nexisting  and new jobs, create new products and services  and\r\n\r\ncapture   new   markets  in  this  new  stage   of   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even as we try to maximise the potential of our\r\n\r\npeople,  we  can never produce enough to meet all the  talent\r\n\r\nneeds of our economy. We must therefore continue to draw  the\r\n\r\nbest  and  brightest  from around the world  to  our  shores.\r\n\r\nBesides  adopting  a  welcoming attitude  to  foreigners  and\r\n\r\ntalent-friendly  immigration  policies,   we   need   to   be\r\n\r\nattractive as a place to work, live and play.\r\n\r\nDeregulation  -  Priming Our Local Enterprises for the Global\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to promote a competitive domestic\r\n\r\nmarket. Competition\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbegins  at  home. Our firms cannot compete globally  if  they\r\n\r\ncannot  compete locally. Local competition will spur them  to\r\n\r\nbe   more   efficient,  creative  and  innovative.   Besides,\r\n\r\ncompetition  will  benefit consumers  by  moderating  prices,\r\n\r\nimproving services, and increasing product choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to deregulate our economy. We have\r\n\r\nopened up the telecommunications sector with a big bang.   We\r\n\r\nare  progressively liberalising the financial sector.  We are\r\n\r\ngearing  up  for  a full opening of the electricity  and  gas\r\n\r\nmarkets this year. We will refine these policies in the light\r\n\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made significant progress in the setting up of a\r\n\r\nnew  energy  market  regime since  its  announcement  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in March last year.  Amongst other measures,  for\r\n\r\nthe  electricity  industry, the system and  market  operation\r\n\r\nfunctions  will be transferred from PowerGrid to  the  Energy\r\n\r\nMarket Authority of Singapore (EMA).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail sector of the energy market will be\r\n\r\nliberalised in phases. Beginning later this year, the  market\r\n\r\nfor  large  consumers will be progressively made contestable.\r\n\r\nThe  retail  market  for the remaining one million  consumers\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  opened up after 2002 as  all  households  are\r\n\r\naffected and a detailed study will have to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas industry will be restructured in a similar way\r\n\r\nto  support  a  competitive  framework  for  the  electricity\r\n\r\nindustry.   The  ownership of the gas transportation  system,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  natural  monopoly, will be separated  from  the\r\n\r\ncontestable sectors of gas import, trading and retail.\r\n\r\nManaging the Restructuring of the Economy\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy transits into a knowledge-based economy\r\n\r\nand a new stage of economic growth, we will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromote growth sectors and high value-added industries  which\r\n\r\nwill  help  us  move up the value chain. The Government  will\r\n\r\nencourage the emergence of promising local businesses in such\r\n\r\ngrowth  sectors.   Businesses in sunset  industries  will  be\r\n\r\nhelped to move out to other more profitable sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to support R&D efforts in\r\n\r\norder  to add value to industry and move the country  towards\r\n\r\nhigher  value, knowledge-intensive economic growth.  Our  R&D\r\n\r\nefforts  have  produced positive results to date.  They  have\r\n\r\nhelped  workers in R&D companies increase the value they  add\r\n\r\nto  their  jobs, and also helped raise the share of high-tech\r\n\r\nexports  from  Singapore   -  from 52%  of  non-oil  domestic\r\n\r\nexports in 1990 to 66% in 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the amount committed by Government has\r\n\r\nmore than doubled, from $2 billion allocated for the first 5-year National Technology plan to $4 billion for the second 5-year  Plan (NSTP2000). The next phase of our R&D plan is  the\r\n\r\n$7 billion Science and Technology Plan 2005 (S&T 2005), which\r\n\r\nwill last 5 years from 2001 to 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY2001, we will spend a total of $625 million in this\r\n\r\narea to support activities and programmes that will serve  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  industry  R&D, develop R&D  manpower  capability,\r\n\r\npromote  technopreneurship, enhance knowledge  infrastructure\r\n\r\nand promote economically relevant international R&D.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote life-sciences, EDB has set up a $1 billion\r\n\r\nR&D  fund  and a $1 billion investment fund to attract  life-sciences  R&D and start-up activities. A pharmaceutical  park\r\n\r\nwill  be  developed  at  Tuas, and space  for  life  sciences\r\n\r\nfacilities will be set aside at the Buona Vista Science  Hub.\r\n\r\nManpower  capabilities for the life sciences are  also  being\r\n\r\ndeveloped through various programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the performance of local enterprises, the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Standards Board (PSB) will  help  firms  to\r\n\r\nmodernise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement, adopt IT and increase efficiency.  It will assist\r\n\r\ncompanies in restructuring and moving up the value chain,  or\r\n\r\nmoving  into  growing ones. This will help to rejuvenate  the\r\n\r\nbusiness   scene  and  allow  resources  to  be   re-deployed\r\n\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those local enterprises that are promising, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to help groom them into world-class companies.  The\r\n\r\nexisting   Economic  Development  Assistance  Scheme   (EDAS)\r\n\r\nprovides  local firms with technical assistance and training,\r\n\r\nand  helps  them  to  adopt new technologies,  amongst  other\r\n\r\ninitiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses which are not doing well or facing\r\n\r\nshrinking business prospects, we want to help them cope  with\r\n\r\nthe   change  either  by  upgrading  and  modernising   their\r\n\r\noperations, or shifting to industries with better  prospects.\r\n\r\nThe  retail sector is an area the Government has looked  into\r\n\r\nwith  relevant  public and private agencies.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board will be releasing a  10-year\r\n\r\nstrategic  plan titled Retail 21 shortly. This plan  examines\r\n\r\nthe  challenges faced by the retail sector, and sets out  new\r\n\r\nstrategies  for  growth and expansion  of  the  sector.   The\r\n\r\nobjective   of  Retail  21  is  to  double  retail  workforce\r\n\r\nproductivity by the year 2010. We look forward to hearing the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of Retail 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group of enterprises within the retail sector that\r\n\r\nneeds  particular  assistance  is  the  neighbourhood  shops,\r\n\r\nmarkets and hawker centres in HDB estates.  The Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development assured the House  yesterday  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  lend  them  a  helping  hand.  We  will  be\r\n\r\nannouncing  a  programme that includes elements of  upgrading\r\n\r\nassistance,  incentives  to  help  ease  the  retirement   of\r\n\r\noperators  who wish to do so, and re-training for alternative\r\n\r\nemployment  and trades.  The focus of the programme  is  thus\r\n\r\nnot  just  on  short  term remedies, but  also  on  long-term\r\n\r\nrestructuring for the benefit of all concerned.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development will provide more details  of  this\r\n\r\nAssistance   Programme  during  the   Committee   of   Supply\r\n\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these efforts have a common goal - to facilitate\r\n\r\nrestructuring, and help our companies move up the value chain\r\n\r\nand into growing industries.\r\n\r\nConnecting to the Global Economy\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has thrived by being plugged into the global\r\n\r\neconomic network. In fact, we have just been ranked the  most\r\n\r\nglobalised economy in the world. Last year's total  trade  of\r\n\r\n$470  billion was about 3 times the size of our GDP.  We will\r\n\r\ncontinue to strengthen our economic linkages with the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  world.   So  while Singapore remains  committed  to  the\r\n\r\nlaunch of a new multilateral trade round at WTO, we are  also\r\n\r\npursuing  deeper trade liberalisation initiatives with  like-minded  countries  through bilateral  Free  Trade  Agreements\r\n\r\n(FTAs).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first bilateral FTA with New Zealand has already\r\n\r\ngone  into operation. This year, we aim to conclude FTAs with\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Japan,  Mexico  and  the  US.   We  are  also  in\r\n\r\nexploratory  talks with Canada, India and the  European  Free\r\n\r\nTrade Association (EFTA). Through these FTAs that span across\r\n\r\nregions and continents, we hope to anchor Singapore firmly as\r\n\r\na global trading node.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, we will continue to work towards greater\r\n\r\neconomic  integration with our neighbours through  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nFree  Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), and  e-ASEAN  initiatives.  Deeper economic integration will enhance\r\n\r\nASEAN's  attractiveness as a destination for  global  foreign\r\n\r\ndirect  investments  (FDIs).  This is  particularly  crucial,\r\n\r\ngiven  the rise of China and the inevitable diversion of  FDI\r\n\r\nto Northeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting global free trade and regional economic\r\n\r\ncooperation will help Singapore to continue to do well in the\r\n\r\nglobal economy.\r\n\r\nPublic Services for the New Economy\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forward-looking Government must continuously\r\n\r\nanticipate and welcome\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange,  and  harness  the forces of  change  in  the  global\r\n\r\nenvironment.  The  Government  must  deliver  services  in  a\r\n\r\nresponsive and timely way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-government is the Public Service's response to the\r\n\r\nincreasing   pervasiveness  of  ICT  or   info-communications\r\n\r\ntechnology.  The  advent of ICT has triggered  rising  public\r\n\r\nexpectations of service standards. We are leveraging  on  ICT\r\n\r\nto  build  an  e-government for the  21st  century,  and  put\r\n\r\nGovernment  services as well as intra-government transactions\r\n\r\nonline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-government will be a major transformation in the\r\n\r\ndelivery of Government services. The Government will be  able\r\n\r\nto  provide services faster, more efficiently, and in a  more\r\n\r\nconvenient way. By the end of 2001, nearly two-thirds of  all\r\n\r\nGovernment services will be available online in some form  or\r\n\r\nother, making them accessible 24 hours a day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these will be wasted time and energy if the\r\n\r\npublic  does  not adjust to a different way  of  seeking  and\r\n\r\nreceiving the services they want. Public officers, too,  must\r\n\r\nadjust  to faster transaction speeds and the tearing down  of\r\n\r\norganisational boundaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as for other changes that are necessary for\r\n\r\nSingapore's transition into the knowledge age, the Government\r\n\r\nis the facilitator who will put into place the infrastructure\r\n\r\nto  help  Singaporeans  improve their living  standards,  but\r\n\r\nultimately  it is up to individual Singaporeans to  make  the\r\n\r\nchoice  and take the necessary steps. In this case, it  means\r\n\r\nacquainting themselves with ICT or overcoming mindsets  about\r\n\r\ntraditional  forms  of service delivery.  Only  then  can  we\r\n\r\nensure  that we get the most value out of the ICT  revolution\r\n\r\nto improve our living standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Our aim has always been\r\n\r\nto  keep business costs down wherever possible and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our corporate tax rate remains competitive.  In  recent\r\n\r\nyears,  many  developed  economies such  as  Germany,  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  Australia  and Ireland have lowered  corporate  tax\r\n\r\nrates in order to stimulate and attract investments. We  have\r\n\r\nto keep pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the New Economy, picking winners will\r\n\r\nbecome  harder. Hence, while we will continue to provide  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to  spur the growth of strategic  industries,  we\r\n\r\nwill also lower the tax rate generally so that new industries\r\n\r\ncan mushroom and thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our corporate tax rate was reduced by half a\r\n\r\npercentage point to 25.5%. This year I have decided to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  corporate tax rate by a further one percentage point  to\r\n\r\n24.5%,  to  take  effect  from YA2002.   This  will  help  us\r\n\r\nmaintain   our   tax  competitiveness  in   an   increasingly\r\n\r\nglobalised world.  It will also help lower the tax burden  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in  Singapore in the coming  year  when  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth is likely to be less robust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also recognises that small businesses are\r\n\r\nan important component of the Singapore economy. To help such\r\n\r\ncompanies, I have decided\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  introduce a tax exemption scheme that will help them grow\r\n\r\nand get established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from YA2002, three-quarters of up to the\r\n\r\nfirst  $10,000 of a company's chargeable income, and one-half\r\n\r\nof  up to the next $90,000 will be exempt from corporate tax.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining chargeable income will be taxed at  the  newly\r\n\r\nlowered rate of 24.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that many small and medium enterprises and\r\n\r\nstart-ups  will have their taxes reduced by more  than  half,\r\n\r\nfor  the same chargeable income. Based on current data, about\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  of taxable companies will be taxed at  less  than\r\n\r\nhalf  the  previous  tax rate. Companies,  most  particularly\r\n\r\nsmaller enterprises, can look forward to being able to plough\r\n\r\nmore  of  their profits back to their businesses  to  exploit\r\n\r\ngrowth opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All companies, not just the small and medium-sized ones,\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy  the  tax exemption. The benefits  passed  on  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  arising from the lower corporate  tax  rate  under\r\n\r\nthis  new tax regime are estimated to amount to $680  million\r\n\r\nannually.  This  overall lowering of  the  tax  burden  is  a\r\n\r\ndemonstration  of  the  Government's  resolve  to  keep   our\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax rate competitive globally, and our  belief  in\r\n\r\nthe importance of creating a pro-business environment that is\r\n\r\nconducive to entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption will not apply to Singapore dividends\r\n\r\nreceived by companies. Such dividends will be taxed at 24.5%.\r\n\r\nIRAS  will  release further details on how the new  corporate\r\n\r\ntax regime is to be applied.\r\n\r\nRaising Productivity  -  the CSOP scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's environment, the most successful businesses\r\n\r\nwill  be  those that are able to motivate their employees  to\r\n\r\ngreater   innovation   and   enterprise.   Performance-linked\r\n\r\ncompensation systems, such as employee stock option\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschemes, can be powerful tools to achieve this objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a special provision for start-ups, I introduced the\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme last  May  where\r\n\r\n50%  of  stock option gains is exempted from income  tax  for\r\n\r\nemployees of such companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I indicated I would introduce a separate\r\n\r\nscheme  that  would  be  available to  the  more  established\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Today, I am glad to announce the  \"Company  Stock\r\n\r\nOption\" scheme, or the CSOP scheme for short.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, income tax exemption will be granted\r\n\r\nfor up to $1 million worth of stock option gains arising from\r\n\r\nthe exercise of the employee's options over a 10-year period.\r\n\r\nOut  of the $1 million, the first $2,000 worth of gains  each\r\n\r\nyear  will be given 100% tax exemption. This makes the scheme\r\n\r\nvery attractive for the lower-paid employees. In addition,  I\r\n\r\nhave  also  decided  to exempt from income  tax  25%  of  the\r\n\r\nremaining  gains. Coupled with the absence of  capital  gains\r\n\r\ntaxes  and  our  low  personal tax  rates,  the  taxation  of\r\n\r\nemployee  stock  option  gains  in  Singapore  will  be  very\r\n\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSOP scheme will be available to all companies that\r\n\r\nmeet  certain  conditions. One key condition  that  companies\r\n\r\nhave  to  satisfy before they can qualify for the  scheme  is\r\n\r\nthat  they will have to offer the stock options to  at  least\r\n\r\nhalf  the  employees  in the company. This  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies to provide the benefits of the scheme to lower-paid\r\n\r\nworkers  as  well.  The scheme will be available  to  options\r\n\r\ngranted  with  effect  from 1st April 2001.  Details  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  can be found in Annex 1.  -  [Cols. 56-7  -   Company\r\n\r\nStock Option Scheme].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010223/20010223-HA-0730057.htm\">ANNEX 1 - COMPANY STOCK OPTION SCHEME</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExemption of Withholding Tax for Software Payments\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological advances have made the use of info-communications technology or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICT,  and consequently software, increasingly widespread.  We\r\n\r\nforesee  a  future in which almost all products and  services\r\n\r\nwill  require the use of software either in their  production\r\n\r\nor operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to lower the cost of doing business in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as well as encourage our businesses to  make  the\r\n\r\nbest  use of technology. The Government is also committed  to\r\n\r\ncreating an environment that is conducive to the growth of e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these in mind, and as part of our continuing\r\n\r\nefforts  to  enhance  Singapore's  competitiveness,  I   have\r\n\r\ndecided  that  payments  for  the  following  categories   of\r\n\r\nsoftware   made  to  non-residents  will  be  exempted   from\r\n\r\nwithholding   tax.   These  are:  site   licences,   software\r\n\r\ndownloaded  from  the  Internet by  end-users,  and  software\r\n\r\nbundled  with  hardware. This change  will  take  effect  for\r\n\r\npayments due on or after today.\r\n\r\nWriting Down Allowances for Intellectual Property\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, intangible assets such as intellectual\r\n\r\nproperties  and  their  exploitation will  be  a  significant\r\n\r\nsource of competitive advantage in the Knowledge Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance Singapore's competitiveness in this respect,\r\n\r\nI  have  decided  to  improve the  current  incentive  scheme\r\n\r\nrelating to patents and know-how. The improved scheme extends\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  coverage to more categories  of  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperties. Writing down allowances over a 5-year period will\r\n\r\nbe  granted for capital expenditure incurred on the following\r\n\r\ncategories  of intellectual properties acquired on  or  after\r\n\r\ntoday:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Patents;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Copyrights and Related Rights;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Trade Marks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Registered Designs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Geographical Indications;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Protection of Confidential Information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This improved scheme will also cover a wider range of\r\n\r\nindustries.  It will be administered by EDB and IDA.  Details\r\n\r\nwill be released by them shortly.\r\n\r\nReduction of Property Tax Rate\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce business costs, I have decided to cut\r\n\r\nthe  property  tax  rate from 12 to 10%.  This  will  improve\r\n\r\nSingapore's  cost competitiveness vis-a-vis other  countries.\r\n\r\nThe  cut will apply to all properties: commercial, industrial\r\n\r\nand  residential.  It will cost the Government  an  estimated\r\n\r\n$336 million a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in property tax rate will take effect from 1st\r\n\r\nJuly  2001,  when the 25% property tax rebate for  commercial\r\n\r\nand  industrial  properties  ends.  The  reduction  will   be\r\n\r\nparticularly helpful to small businesses that are tenants  of\r\n\r\nJTC  and HDB properties. These businesses have been the  main\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  of the property tax rebate for industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  properties, passed on by the JTC, HDB  and  other\r\n\r\nlandlords.  The  Government  would  like  to  encourage   all\r\n\r\nlandlords to pass on savings from the property tax  rate  cut\r\n\r\nto their tenants.\r\n\r\nGiving a Boost to Individuals\r\n\r\nReduction in Individual Income Tax Rates\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the tax burden for individuals, as well as\r\n\r\nreward  individual effort and enterprise, I have  decided  to\r\n\r\ncut  income  tax rates of all income bands with  effect  from\r\n\r\nYA2002. The tax rates of all bands will be reduced by between\r\n\r\ntwo  and  five percentage points. The top marginal  tax  rate\r\n\r\nwill  be  reduced from the current 28% to 26%. All individual\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  will  pay  less tax, with the majority  paying  at\r\n\r\nleast 25% less tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In percentage terms, lower-income and middle-income\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  will  benefit  most.  For example,  an  individual\r\n\r\nearning $35,000 a year will enjoy tax savings of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  30%.  Taxpayers who earn $100,000 a  year  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nsavings of about 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we introduced GST and at the same time gave\r\n\r\ntaxpayers a  $700 GST-related income tax rebate to soften the\r\n\r\ninitial  impact of GST. The rebate was lowered  by  $50  each\r\n\r\nyear until it reached $500 in YA 1998. In order to streamline\r\n\r\nthe  individual tax structure, I have decided to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nrebate  over  time,  and incorporate its  benefits  into  the\r\n\r\nindividual tax structure. To this end, the first $7,500 of an\r\n\r\nindividual's  chargeable income will not be  taxed,  and  the\r\n\r\n$500  GST-related income tax rebate will be reduced  to  $250\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly, as a first step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect of all these changes to the individual\r\n\r\nincome tax regime is to make all taxpayers better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting personal tax rates will lower the tax burden of\r\n\r\nworkers and encourage individual effort. Competitive personal\r\n\r\ntax  rates  will also help Singapore retain its local  talent\r\n\r\nand attract new foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures will result in tax savings of $300\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year for taxpayers. The new income tax rates  are\r\n\r\nattached in Annex 2.  (Cols. 58-9).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010223/20010223-HA-0730059.htm\">ANNEX 2 - INCOME  TAX RATES</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaising the Tax Exemption Limit for CPF Contributions\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Self-Employed\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently self-employed persons can claim tax relief for\r\n\r\nCPF  contributions  amounting  to  20%  of  their  income  or\r\n\r\n$14,400,  whichever is lower.  Essentially this is  only  the\r\n\r\nemployee's portion of the CPF contributions for employees  of\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge-based economy, we can expect more\r\n\r\npeople  to  be  self-employed.  They should be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nsave  for their old age to the same extent as those  who  are\r\n\r\nemployees.  The self-employed is, in a way, both employer and\r\n\r\nemployee.   Today,  he  is  granted tax  deductions  for  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions up to what employees are required to contribute\r\n\r\nfor their ordinary wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy will be adjusted so that self-employed\r\n\r\npersons basically receive the same tax benefits from the  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme  as  both employer and employee combined  with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom YA 2002. A self-employed person will get tax relief  for\r\n\r\nCPF contributions amounting to 36% of his income, subject  to\r\n\r\na  maximum income of $72,000. This way, entrepreneurs running\r\n\r\ntheir own businesses will not be disadvantaged. Self-employed\r\n\r\npersons  will be more motivated to save for their  retirement\r\n\r\nby  voluntarily contributing more to their CPF accounts.  The\r\n\r\ntax  benefits  they  will gain from this policy  change  will\r\n\r\namount to $6 million or more per year. This change will  take\r\n\r\neffect for CPF contributions made from this year.\r\n\r\nWeathering the Transition\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to our ability to stay focused, act as a nation\r\n\r\nand  make the necessary strategic changes in our economy lies\r\n\r\nin  the unity of our people. We must continue to build on the\r\n\r\nsocial   cohesion  and  political  stability  that  we   have\r\n\r\npainstakingly developed over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help those who are facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  the  transition  period  as   our   economy\r\n\r\nrestructures. In the short run, the Government  will  provide\r\n\r\ntemporary assistance to those who need help to tide over hard\r\n\r\ntimes. In the long term, the best way to help them is to give\r\n\r\nthem   the  means  to  help  themselves,  through  education,\r\n\r\ntraining and retraining.\r\n\r\nSharing the Budget Surplus\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's package of \"share-outs\" will be the most\r\n\r\ngenerous  to date. This package is possible both  because  of\r\n\r\nour  past adherence to the principles of fiscal prudence  and\r\n\r\nthe  hard work of all Singaporeans, that have allowed  us  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a substantial surplus. Sharing the budget surplus is\r\n\r\nan important way by which everyone benefits from the nation's\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCPF Top-ups\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible Singaporeans have, in January this year,\r\n\r\nreceived  the first payment of the $500 to $1,700 CPF  Top-up\r\n\r\nannounced  by  the Prime Minister in August  last  year.  The\r\n\r\nsecond payment, costing $1 billion, will be given within  the\r\n\r\nnext  12  months. The CPF Top-up is a tangible way of sharing\r\n\r\nthe nation's success with Singaporeans. It was also unique in\r\n\r\nthat  it  was the first time that a CPF Top-up was structured\r\n\r\nto give more to those in the lower income group.\r\n\r\nPersonal Tax Rebate\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the good performance of the economy in 2000,\r\n\r\nan  across-the-board one-off tax rebate of 10% on  individual\r\n\r\nincome tax will be granted in YA 2001, up from the 5% for  YA\r\n\r\n2000.  This  is another way of sharing budget surpluses  with\r\n\r\ntaxpayers. It will save taxpayers a total of $485 million.\r\n\r\nUtilities Save\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extension of the utilities rebates given to HDB\r\n\r\nhouseholds from 1997 to 2000, the Government will  be  giving\r\n\r\nutilities rebates totalling $350 to households living  in  1-to  3-room  HDB  flats, $300 to households living  in  4-room\r\n\r\nflats  and  $250 to households living in 5-room flats.  These\r\n\r\nwill be given in 10 equal monthly payments from July 2001  to\r\n\r\nApril  2002.  There will be two months in the year  in  which\r\n\r\nhouseholds have to make full payments, so that they  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to save on water and electricity. As  such,  this\r\n\r\nscheme will be renamed Utilities Save.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats will get $35\r\n\r\na month, those in 4-room HDB flats $30 a month and those in 5-room  HDB  flats $25 a month. Any unutilised  amount  of  the\r\n\r\nUtilities Save given in any month will be rolled over  to  be\r\n\r\nused in the subsequent months. This Utilities Save scheme  is\r\n\r\nmore generous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan the $100 and $200 utilities rebates given last year  and\r\n\r\namounts to a total of $226 million.\r\n\r\nS&C Charges and Rental Rebates\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend and increase the rebates on\r\n\r\nHDB Service and Conservancy (S&C) charges and rentals granted\r\n\r\nover recent years to Singaporeans living in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats. The new package will be the most generous\r\n\r\nto date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 1-room flats will receive rental\r\n\r\nrebates of $12 per month, rebates for S&C charges of  $8  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  four  months'  net  rent and  five  months'  net  S&C\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 2-room flats will receive rental\r\n\r\nrebates  of $8 per month, rebates for S&C charges of  $7  per\r\n\r\nmonth, two months' net rent and four months' net S&C charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 3-room flats will be given rebates\r\n\r\nof  $4  per  month for S&C charges and four months'  net  S&C\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for households living in 4-room and 5-room flats,\r\n\r\nthey  will be entitled to three months and two months of  net\r\n\r\nS&C  charges respectively.

Low-income households which do not live in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats   can  continue  to  receive  help  from  the  Citizens\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees (CCCs) Assistance Scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Allowance\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help pensioners drawing low pensions cope with\r\n\r\ninflation,  the Government introduced an ex-gratia  allowance\r\n\r\ncalled  the Singapore Allowance in April 1974. This ex-gratia\r\n\r\nallowance  is  an  additional  payment  over  and  above  the\r\n\r\npensions  that the Government pays to pensioners residing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Allowance was last revised in August 1997,\r\n\r\nwhen the quantum was increased by $10, from $130 to $140  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  and  the gross pension ceiling raised  from  $900  to\r\n\r\n$950.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has decided to increase the Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance  further by $10 to $150 per month,  and  raise  the\r\n\r\ngross  pension  ceiling from the current $950 to  $1,050  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  The revision will give an additional $1.7  million  a\r\n\r\nyear to pensioners residing in Singapore, of which there  are\r\n\r\nabout  12,100.  The change will take effect  from  1st  April\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging Philanthropy - Tax Deduction for Shares\r\n\r\nDonation\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government is taking the lead in ensuring that\r\n\r\nthe  fruits of success are shared with the less fortunate  in\r\n\r\nsociety,  we hope that Singaporeans who are better  off  will\r\n\r\nchoose to give more back to society by way of time, expertise\r\n\r\nand donation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to current tax deductibility for donations\r\n\r\nto  qualifying  institutions, I  have  decided  to  make  the\r\n\r\ndonation of shares tax deductible also. This opens up another\r\n\r\navenue for charitable donations, and is a recognition of  the\r\n\r\nfact that a rising number of companies are using shares as  a\r\n\r\nform of remuneration for their employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, tax deductions will be granted to\r\n\r\nindividuals who donate to Institutions of a Public  Character\r\n\r\n(IPCs)  shares  which are listed on the SGX and  unit  trusts\r\n\r\nreadily  tradable in Singapore. The concession will apply  to\r\n\r\ndonations made from January 2001.\r\n\r\nTransfers\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1 billion is being proposed for the second payment of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Top-up  of $500 to $1,700 announced  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in August last year. In addition, the Government  is\r\n\r\nproposing to contribute another $500 million to the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Endowment Fund, bringing the total to $1 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund was set up to help lower-income and\r\n\r\nlower-middle income households with the cost of nursing  home\r\n\r\ncare,  while  the  Medical Endowment Fund helps  lower-income\r\n\r\nindividuals with their medical bills so as to ensure that  no\r\n\r\none  will be left without access to medical care because they\r\n\r\ncannot afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further build up the ElderCare Fund and the Medical\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund, the Government will contribute $250  million\r\n\r\nto  the  ElderCare Fund (bringing the total to $750  million)\r\n\r\nand  $100 million to the Medical Endowment Fund (bringing the\r\n\r\ntotal to $800 million) in FY2001.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS TAX CHANGES\r\n\r\nDuties on Cigarettes\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our continuing national effort to discourage\r\n\r\nsmoking,  especially  among our youth,  the  excise  duty  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes will be increased from $150 to $180 per  kilogram.\r\n\r\nDuties on cigarettes were last revised in February 2000.  The\r\n\r\nchange  will  take  effect from today. The estimated  revenue\r\n\r\ngain is $102 million per year.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of Budget 2001 at the macro level is to\r\n\r\nposition  Singapore for the challenges of the global  economy\r\n\r\nin the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cuts in the corporate and property tax rates, the\r\n\r\nnew corporate tax structure, and the exemption of withholding\r\n\r\ntax  on  software payments  -  these will all lower  business\r\n\r\ncosts, and help us maintain our international competitiveness\r\n\r\nas a business location.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the global economy becomes more knowledge-based, to maintain competitiveness, it is no longer\r\n\r\nsufficient for us to just cut costs, or wring the last bit of\r\n\r\nefficiency  out  of  existing systems.  Innovations  and  new\r\n\r\nideas  will  play an increasingly important role in  creating\r\n\r\nwealth  for  companies  in Singapore, and  consequently,  for\r\n\r\nSingapore as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we are encouraging productivity and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  through the new  corporate  tax  structure\r\n\r\nfavouring  small enterprises and start-ups, a more favourable\r\n\r\ntreatment  towards  stock  options  for  employees  of    all\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  not  just  start-ups,  and  raising  the  tax\r\n\r\nexemption limits on voluntary CPF contributions by the  self-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will help our companies to move up\r\n\r\nthe  value  chain  and into growing industries  by  our  $868\r\n\r\nmillion   spending  in  R&D  and  the  Economic   Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme, and give assistance to local  enterprises\r\n\r\nas they adapt to changing market conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though businesses are important, even more important are\r\n\r\nthe  people.  This is why we are investing nearly $7  billion\r\n\r\nin  the education of our children and continuous training  of\r\n\r\nour   people,   through   our   investment   in   educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions, the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme, and\r\n\r\nthe Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, among many other ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government will continue to create\r\n\r\nthe  conditions  to attract and retain talented  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand foreigners to live in and contribute to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this year's budget at a micro level is,\r\n\r\nas I mentioned earlier, to help everyone in Singapore make  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  transition  into  the  knowledge-based   economy.\r\n\r\nEducation and re-training are key. Adjustment takes time  and\r\n\r\neffort.  The lowly skilled are in greatest danger  of  losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs. The lower-paid need the most help, but  most  of\r\n\r\nall  they  must  want to help themselves. The Government  can\r\n\r\nlend  a  helping  hand  in  the  process.  We  are  therefore\r\n\r\nimplementing a slew of measures to ease the financial  burden\r\n\r\non  individuals,  and  share the  economic  surplus  that  we\r\n\r\nenjoyed in year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are cutting individual income tax rates\r\n\r\nsignificantly, giving a one-off 10% tax rebate on  individual\r\n\r\nincome tax,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinuing with rebates on S&C charges and rents, and helping\r\n\r\nHDB  households  through  the Utilities  Save  scheme.   This\r\n\r\npackage  of  measures has been intentionally designed  to  be\r\n\r\nprogressive, to benefit the less well-off more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus on enabling the economically active to\r\n\r\nadapt  better in the new millennium, we do not want to forget\r\n\r\nthe  others.   This  is  the  reason  for  allowing  the  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction   of   shares  donation  to   IPCs   to   encourage\r\n\r\nphilanthropy,  as  well as the Government's  contribution  of\r\n\r\n$250  million to the ElderCare Fund and $100 million  to  the\r\n\r\nMedical Endowment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place for everyone in Singapore, and everyone\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from good governance. It will take  effort  and\r\n\r\neven  a  fair amount of difficulty to reach where  we,  as  a\r\n\r\nnation,  want  to  get to.  This Budget serves  to  encourage\r\n\r\neveryone to stay united and succeed together.
