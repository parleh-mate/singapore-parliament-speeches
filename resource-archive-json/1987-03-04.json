It is the responsibility of any Government to set the National Agenda, to formulate policies \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the national interest, to mobilize support for these policies and to develop a consensus among the population on the way forward for Singapore. To say that these policies will have the support and the endorsement of the People's Action Party is to state the obvious. Any government which does not make full use of all the means at its disposal to achieve national goals is in dereliction of its duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think the Minister has answered the question. The question is, to what extent an issue is considered national in nature to warrant the use of Government machinery by the ruling party.

It is the Government's responsibility to debate issues, to sell policies, to implement decisions. The Government makes use of all its machinery for this purpose - grassroots organizations, the Feedback Unit, SBC. The subjects which are discussed under the National Agenda are entirely proper subjects which concern every Singaporean and which the Government wants every Singaporean to take an interest in. If there are subjects which are of a purely Party nature, which the Member for Potong Pasir feels have been illegitimately labelled as national issues and which the Government has been improperly using the Government machinery to discuss, I would request him to list them and we can examine them to see whether, in fact, they are illegitimate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it looks like we are going around the mulberry bush.

This is to prevent any school site from being used for land speculation. The surrendered school sites will then be put to some other public uses. The Government has consistently adhered to this policy of quid pro quo exchange in all cases of relocation of aided schools, even in cases where the land on which the existing school stood did not belong to the school, such as Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School and Geylang Methodist Girls' School where the land belonged to the Church. Also, most mission school sites are on land owned by the missions or churches that manage the schools.

Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 31st January 1987, the Board had a total of 21,939 completed flats which remained unsold. The waiting list as at the same date was 62,198. The breakdown into flat types are given in a Table (Cols. 103 - 104) that has been distributed to Members. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490103.htm\">Table - UNSOLD HDB FLATS AS AT 31 JANUARY 87 (Cols. 103 - 104)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for 3-room and 4-room Simplified flats, demand on the waiting list exceeds the number of unsold flats. They are therefore in the process of being sold. In the case of 3-room and 4-S flats, because of past high demand, HDB accelerated the construction of these flats to shorten the waiting time. However, when the flats were under construction, demand for such flats dropped resulting in the present high vacancy rates. Of the total unsold flats, 13,430 units have been unsold for more than a year. These are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mainly the 3-room and 4-S flats located in New Towns such as Yishun. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the 21,939 unsold flats is about $1.66 billion. Of this cost, that which is attributable to 3-room and 4-S flats is about $980 million. Experience shows that the take-up rate for vacant flats which are mainly in new town zones would initially be low. This is due to the fact that new town infrastructural and transport facilities are less developed compared to established estates. There are plans to improve the transportation network for the residents in these new towns. HDB will also speed up the building of other infrastructural facilities. With these measures, the HDB anticipates that the unsold flats will be taken up in due course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of flats to be built in 1987 is about 32,000. The HDB is not building any more 3-room and 4-S flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister if the unsold flats, especially those that are unsold for more than a year, have been over-priced, and will the Ministry consider reducing those prices according to market demands? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a matter of opinion whether they are over-priced. The real reason why the 3-room flats are not being taken up at the rate at which we anticipated is that Singaporeans' expectations of the kind of house that they should have has gone up. At that time, when the 3-room and 4-S flats were built they were really meant to try and cater for those whom we felt would not be able to afford the normal 4-room and 5-room flats. But as it turned out, incomes went up to a point where many who would have previously gone only for the 3-room or 4-S flats have registered for the 4-room Improved and the 5-room flats. But we are quite confident, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the 3-room flats will be taken up in due course even at the present prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Queenstown):</b> Sir, since the Government is encouraging the people to have more babies now, the likelihood of these 3-room flats being unsold will be greater. Is it not a good point for the Ministry of National Development to try to convert these 3-room flats \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> into, say, 6-room flats so that more babies could be accommodated? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing Board has, in fact, looked into the question of converting some of these 3-room flats, not for the reason that the Member for Queenstown mentioned, but because the demand for 4-room improved flats is greater than we had anticipated. Not all the flats can be converted because of design restrictions and also because some of the vacant flats are in blocks which have already been sold. You cannot convert partially vacant blocks. Some of the blocks have been converted, such that two 3-room flats have been converted into one 4-room flat and one small 1-room or studio apartment which can be occupied by the parents of the family in the adjacent flat. We do not know whether the demand for this type of flats will be sufficient to warrant conversion of all the blocks but we will study the situation as we go along and decide how conversion should be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, would the Government be prepared to consider allocating these 3-room flats to single person resettlement cases? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present occupancy per HDB flat is already below what we have planned when we planned for the housing of Singapore over the next 50 to 60 years. To allocate one 3-room flat to a single person will mean that the average occupancy per flat will go down further and we just do not have space in Singapore to build flats to accommodate single persons in flats of their own. The present policy, even for 1-room flats, is to ask two single persons to join together to occupy a 1-room flat. If we think that we do not have land to even allocate one single room flat to a single person, the question of a 3-room flat for a single person does not arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the Minister confirm that some of these 3-room flats have been vacant for more than a year and, if so, why not allocate them to single person resettlement cases? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my answer to the main question, I did say and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> give figures of the flats that have been vacant for more than one year. I think we should not allow the present situation to change a basic policy. When we find in a year or two that demand goes up, we may find that we have made the wrong decision. It is best that we stick to the basic policy. The basic policy and the basic facts are these. We do not have land in Singapore to house people in a manner where one person can occupy a 3-room flat. That we cannot run away from, and I think we should stick to a policy that makes maximum and optimum use of our land. Even though there is a temporary over-supply of 3-room flats, we should stick to the policy and not allocate to single persons. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Minister know that these single persons are resettled not out of their own volition and does he think that it is better to leave the flats unoccupied rather than allocating them to these single person resettlers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think in the long term interest of Singapore, it is better to leave the flats unoccupied for a short period. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> What does the Minister think that these single persons should do in the meantime when they are being resettled? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member knows the various avenues open to such single persons. They can join up with another person and apply for a 1-room flat or if the person is considered a senior citizen (in the case of males over 50 years and in the case of females over 40 years) two such persons can get together to buy a flat. There are various avenues open to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Does the Minister appreciate that these single persons have been happily minding their own farms until the Government resettles them? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we had allowed people to happily mind their own business, Singapore would not be what it is today. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUGANG NEW TOWN</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Completion date)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National Development when Hougang New Town will be fully completed; and whether he will indicate the number of residential units and the type of infrastructural facilities and services to be provided there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Hougang New Town will be fully developed in the mid-1990s.

This is always a problem with every new town because people who move in first complain that they do not have all the facilities that other older new towns have. This is just a matter of being patient. Things can be done only one at a time. The only way to please everybody would be to build the whole town with all the facilities before anybody moves in.

We built hawker centres because in the early days there were umpteen, in fact countless, hawkers around town and the idea of building hawker centres was to resite them in proper places so that they would be able to organize themselves, organize their business, sell under more controlled conditions meaning, if they were food handlers they would be under some kind of supervision from my Ministry to make sure that they did not unnecessarily transmit diseases and so on. But today, it is different. Today the illegal hawker feels that he wants to have a hawker stall of his own choice, wherever it is. Then I think it is best that he goes to those shops situated in shopping complexes, in offices, and so on, and make a bid for it because in such places more market forces are operating there, rather than for Government to build more hawker stalls in popular areas and subsidizing them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, would the Senior Parliamentary Secretary be able to tell us the age profile and the financial background of these illegal hawkers, and what proportion of these illegal hawkers are actually repeat offenders? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> I have some figures here.

(2) When the goods, especially foodstuffs are vegetables, are seized from these illegal hawkers, what does the Government do with them? I hope the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is taking them down. (3) How many complaints are there against enforcement officers for their rough treatment of illegal hawkers? And (4) what is the average earnings of an illegal hawker per month? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are quite a lot of assumptions made in those questions, for a start. By the very nature of their job, illegal hawkers, try to run away from authority. They disappear when the officer comes. Therefore, it is not possible to count them. So if you ask me how many illegal hawkers are there in Singapore, my answer is that I do not know. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Estimate. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> It is a lot.

Let me tell you how they operate. Their modus operandi is very interesting. They operate in such a way that when you get to them they can run away and leave behind very small quantities of goods that they are selling. Their remaining goods are tucked away somewhere in small places where it is very difficult to spot. They may be put away under the staircase of an HDB block, or they may be kept in a van somewhere. But they are certainly not put on sale in huge lots. And secondly, if they want to sell vegetables, it is too difficult because they have to go to the auction market right early in the morning to bid and so on. They do not do that kind of a thing. They sell things like otah-otah, ngoh hiang, and so on, which are easier to sell. So if the Member asks me what is the percentage, how much vegetables are seized out of the total goods --- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> What do they do with the vegetables? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> What do you do with them? When these things are seized, there are two ways we can dispose of them. If they are fruits and vegetables, then they are straightaway sent to the charity homes for the residents to eat. But if they are non-perishable items like trinkets, watches, they are taken to and kept in a warehouse - I think there is a store somewhere in Pasir Panjang - and then after conviction, we destroy the goods or they are auctioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>USE OF DISPOSABLE UTENSILS BY HAWKERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Policy review)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment if his Ministry will review the policy of urging hawkers to use disposable utensils in view of (i) persistent complaints by hawkers about \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the additional cost involved; and (ii) complaints by customers about the inconvenience of using such disposable utensils. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present practice in hawker centres is for individual stallholders to provide their own crockery. After the customers have finished their meals, the stallholders are expected to collect the used crockery. Very often, however, they do not. Tables are left cluttered with used crockery because the stallholders do not have the time to retrieve their crockery, especially during peak hours. This has therefore often caused delays and annoyance to new customers waiting to be served. Often also, stallholders will gather together all the used utensils that do not belong to them and place them on the floor in order to clear the tables to acommodate new customers. Such practices are not desirable from a public health standpoint. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of disposable crockery allows for a centralized system of clearing tables. Soiled disposable crockery can be cleared away immediately by a small team of workers. There is no need for retrieval by stallholders and tables can be cleared and cleaned quicker and more efficiently. Overall cleanliness and hygiene will be improved compared to the present conditions where there is often just too much waste left all over the place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of disposable crockery is also more hygienic and because stallholders generally do not pay enough attention to washing their crockery thoroughly when business is hectic, as it invariably happens in the popular hawker centres which are frequented by both locals and tourists alike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With disposable crockery, stallholders will save on the use of water and the need to replace chipped and stained crockery. Service to customers will be faster, more efficient, thus enabling stallholders to transact more business. Worker utilization will also be more efficient, thus saving on labour costs and improving productivity. Over the longer run, the tangible and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> intangible benefits derived from the use of disposable crockery will offset any immediate extra costs incurred by the stallholders in introducing disposable crockery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the majority of customers are finding the use of disposable crockery inconvenient. However, some may need more time to make the necessary adjustments, as obviously disposable crockery is not meant to be used exactly in the same way as one would use melamine or metal utensils. Stallholders may also need to modify to some extent the preparation and the serving of certain kinds of food, for example, meats may have to be cut into smaller pieces for customers to manage easily, using disposable utensils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disposable crockery is already being used extensively in many food centres such as Changi Airport Canteen, Picnic Food Court, Forum Galleria Hawker Centre and my Ministry's own cafeteria, with no serious problems. In addition, many stallholders have been selling take-away foods in disposable containers, and most people are eating out of such disposable containers with no undue problems. With disposable crockery, the customer is assured of a fresh plate, a fresh bowl, and a fresh cup at every meal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of disposable crockery in the five hawker centres is a pilot project. The hawker centres included in this pilot project will all enjoy good patronage with high business turnover and therefore ideally suited to the use of disposable crockery. The project has just begun and, like many other new projects, it has teething problems. Given sufficient time for adjustments by both stallholders and customers, I am confident that disposable crockery will not only be accepted but will be preferred by the large majority. My Ministry is monitoring the situation closely and where disposable crockery is really not suitable for certain foods or in specific circumstances, we will make exemptions in such cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, firstly, were the hawkers in the five selected centres consulted before they were asked to use the disposable utensils? Secondly, are the hawkers in these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> selected centres compelled to use the disposable utensils even though they may find it inconvenient? Thirdly, will the Ministry extend this practice to all hawkers in Singapore eventually? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> First of all, they had been consulted, even with the CCCs, MCs and I believe lately they have also discussed this problem with the MPs. Secondly, they have not been compelled to use such things but they have been persuaded. Finally, as to whether we will extend it to all hawker centres, the answer is yes, once the pilot project is completed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether his Ministry has any plans to combat any general price increase by the hawkers because of this new policy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Actually there is no necessity for the hawkers to increase their prices. Because if you look at the disposable crockery as such, it fits into the present system better than the china ware or the melamine ware. Perhaps I could explain. The present system is this. The food is prepared by the hawker who puts it into a melamine ware or china ware and, serves it to the customer. After the customer has eaten, the hawker or his assistant comes along and takes it away, stacks it somewhere for washing later on. If the Member goes to the Newton Hawker Centre or other more popular hawker centres, he will see stacks of these bowls, cups and plates waiting to be washed. In the case of disposable polystyrene crockery, the same thing happens. He prepares, he puts it into the polystyrene and he serves. But the difference is that it is thrown away and a new polystyrene crockery is used. So it is faster. It saves manpower. It increases productivity. It saves water. You do not have to replace chipped wares and so on. And it will offset the 10 cents. Therefore, there is no justification for the hawkers to increase their prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, does this mean that his Ministry would take up all cases of unjustified price increases when they receive complaints from consumers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> We will do what we can. But I think the Member for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Jalan Kayu is aware that we believe in free market forces. In the newspapers, somebody wrote to say that there was an increase of 50 cents or 60 cents or something like that. If I am a consumer, I will just not go to that stall. Eventually, market forces will have to operate. And a hawker who is more honest, who serves his consumers better quality food, gives better service and also cleaner food with the polystyrenes, there are less chances of contamination. You might like to think of popular hawker centres like the Newton Hawker Centre. All kinds of people go to the Newton Hawker Centre, the old, the young, the fat, the thin, the healthy, the not-so-healthy, the locals as well as the tourists. And we do not know who is healthy and who is not healthy. So there is a possibility that diseases can be transmitted through poor food handling and through poor hygiene. The important thing is that the hawker must be able in these days and times with younger people expecting higher standards and so on and so forth to present that image, the image of a developed country rather than an undeveloped country. And that being the case, I think they should be able to attract more customers and there should be no problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, would his Ministry consider placing in the hawker centres large disposable bins such as the type found in fast food restaurants, so as to allow customers to throw away the disposable crockery? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> I think that is a good idea and I will ask the Ministry to look into it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Sir, has the Ministry done any costing of the two methods of hawking food? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> On the actual costing, no. But I have got the prices of some of these polystyrene containers and the Member may wish to know what the costs are like. If you use a small bowl, it is 3 cents. If you use a medium sized bowl it is 3 1/2 cents, and a large bowl is about 7 cents. As for the plates, it is the same, about 3 cents, 5 cents and 6 cents. For spoons it is 1 1/4 cents. A fork and spoon cost 2 1/2 cents. Chopsticks cost 1 1/4 cents. So you \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can almost estimate that it is not very much. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Sir, although it is exciting to know the cost of the various items, what I am interested to know is, by using these disposable wares, does it really cost the hawker more than the present system? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> I have already given the explanation earlier on in my answer to one of the Members. Yes, it is going to cost about 10 cents more per service. But weigh this against the tremendous advantages the hawker gets out of this system. That 10 cents will be nothing. I do not think he should raise prices because there is no justification for it at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, if the Ministry believes in private enterprise and initiative, why not allow these hawkers to have their own initiative?

But when we know as a matter of fact that disposable utensils are much better, they are more productive, they reduce the risk to consumers in terms of safeguarding their health, and when we know that it is a saving on our water resources and we know also that there are advantages plus, plus, plus; then of course we have to go out and persuade them. And I think that it is good if Members of Parliament will join us in this crusade because it will help us at the end of it all to achieve the targets of the Vision of 1999. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon.

Ministerial Statement, Dr Tan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>UNIVERSITY TUITION FEES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Education)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>11.55 am \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will remember that in March 1985 and again last year during the debate on the Estimates of the Ministry of Education in the Committee of Supply, I pointed out that students at our Universities, the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological Institute, were extremely heavily subsidized by our taxpayers. To reduce the subsidy, I suggested that it would be worthwhile for us to move to the American system whereby the tuition fees are fixed at a certain percentage of the recurring cost per student for the various courses available in the Universities. In making the suggestion, I emphasized that whatever scheme we devise we must make sure that students who come from poor families are not penalized or prevented from acquiring a tertiary education simply because of their financial circumstances. Sir, it has taken some two years to work out a scheme which is equitable and workable. I would like today to inform Members of the main details. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with some statistics. Each year, some 40,000 pupils register for Primary 1 and Pre-Primary in our schools. Of these 40,000 children, 85% go on to secondary schools after passing the PSLE examinations. Those who eventually finish their secondary school education with either 'N' or 'O' levels represent 80% of the Primary 1 cohort. Approximately 50% of each Primary 1 cohort go on to some form of post-secondary education in either the junior colleges, the pre-university centres or the polytechnics and 12% of the Primary 1 cohort eventually make it to the University. Can I now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute an Annex? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of Annex (Cols. 107 - 108) distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490107.htm\">Annex - 1986 RECURRENT EXPENDITURE AND ENROLMENT (Cols. 107 - 108)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see from Annex 1, the bulk of our student population of over 500,000 are in either schools, junior \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> colleges, pre-university centres or our technical institutions, the VITB and the two polytechnics. The number in our Universities comprise some 16,000 students representing 3% of the student population in Singapore. However, in terms of Government expenditure on education as you can see from Annex 1, 20% of total recurrent expenditure in 1986 was spent on Universities as against 80% in our schools, junior colleges, pre-university centres and the technical institutions. In other words, Sir, Government was spending each year some $14,400 to educate a student at the University level as against $1,900 for each pupil in schools, junior colleges, pre-University centres, the polytechnics and the VITB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With most of our students studying in schools, junior colleges, pre-University centres and the technical institutions, it would be more equitable to reduce the Government's subsidy for University education and increase the amount that we can spend to upgrade the quality of education in our schools. This, Sir, we intend to do. The current proposal to make all our secondary schools single session will, for example, necessitate the building of another 40 to 50 schools with the capital cost alone amounting to over $1 billion. If we wish to reduce class size to a manageable level, we will need to train and employ an additional 3,500 teachers to staff our secondary schools. This will increase operating expenditure in our secondary schools by at least $150 million annually. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, University students on graduation can aspire to be members of highly paid professions. It is only right that after they have graduated they should pay back part of the Government's subsidy in order to lessen the burden of financing University education from taxpayers' money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the academic year 1987/88 excluding the research institutes and the School of Accountancy which will be transferred to the NTI, the NUS has estimated an operating expenditure of $231 million. This expenditure will be financed largely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> through a Government grant of $189 million. The University expects to be able to raise an amount of $14 million from other revenues such as miscellaneous fees and income from investments. The balance of $28 million will have to be raised from tuition fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I announce the tuition fees for the academic year 1987/88, I would like, Sir, to reiterate the point I made at the beginning of my statement that whatever scheme we devise we must make sure that students who come from poor families are not penalized or prevented from acquiring a tertiary education simply because of their financial circumstances. To ensure that the increased fees for the academic year 1987/88 do not bar bright children from poor families from obtaining a University education, the Government has earmarked a sum of $100 million to be operated as a revolving fund to finance student loans which will be given liberally to students at the NUS and the NTI. The terms of the loans will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amount of the loans will be 50% of the new fees to be charged for the academic year 1987/88. Second, the interest rate will be the average of the prime lending rates charged by the Big Four local banks. Third, repayment will be over a maximum period of 15 years, depending on the size of the loan, and commencing not later than one year after graduation. Fourth, one guarantor above 21 years will be required, but no income or residential qualifications will be stipulated for the guarantor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I come to the tuition fees for the current year 1987/88. These are shown in Annex II (Cols. 109 - 110). (Copies of document distributed to Members.) As Members will see, they are divided into three categories, one for the non-laboratory based faculties; (2) for the laboratory based faculties and (3) for dentistry and medicine. Now, Sir, a word on how the new fees are worked out. First of all, these fees will apply to both the NUS and the NTI. The fees are worked out on the following principles. The new fees will achieve a cost recovery of 16% of the average 1987/88 budgetted operating cost \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> per Singapore student in the non-laboratory based faculties, which are Accountancy and Business Administration, Arts and Social Science and Law, as against 12% for 1986/87. For the laboratory based faculties which are Architecture and Building, Engineering and Science, the new fees will represent a cost recovery of 15% for 1987/88 as against 10% for 1986/87. For the Medical and the Dental faculties, the cost recovery for 1987/88 is 9% as against 4% for 1986/87. For foreign students, which means non-Singaporeans and non-permanent residents, the fees will be set, as of now, at 50% above those for Singapore students, and the new fees will apply to existing as well as to new students but with national servicemen enjoying a two-year lag as at present in accordance with present practice. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490109.htm\">Annex II - NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE AND NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE TUITION FEES AND LOANS FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 1987/88 (Cols. 109 - 110)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new fee structure, tuition fees will now fund 12% of the estimated 1987/88 operating cost excluding the capital cost of the NUS as against 8% in 1986/87. With the loan scheme that I have just announced, the amount of fees in 1987/88 that a student studying in the faculties other than Medicine and Dentistry will have to pay from his own funds in cash will be either the same or, in fact, less than the amount the student had to pay in 1986/87. For a Singapore student who is studying either Medicine or Dentistry, he will have to pay in cash $650 more than in 1987/88 than in 1986/87. I think that this should be within the capacity of the Medical or Dentistry students to pay. And if there are genuine cases of financial hardship, then the University has other loan funds which can be used to supplement the Government loans. However, to qualify for these additional loans, I think it is only fair that the student should be required to produce evidence of genuine financial hardship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small nation with a small talent pool. We must develop every child to his fullest potential. Every student who can make it to University is an additional asset for Singapore. We must therefore at all times ensure that children from all economic groups have a chance to be admitted to our Universities. And if Uni- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> versity fees have to be raised further, we will make sure that there is sufficient availability of loan funds so that no student will be denied admission to NUS or to NTI simply because his or her parents cannot afford to pay the fees. Sir, this is a responsibility which Government must fulfil. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that there will be a $100 million loan fund. I would like to ask him whether this is sufficient, and if this fund runs out will the students be able to continue with their University education without having to find other ways of getting money? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter I would like to ask the Minister is the prime rate. He has mentioned that he is following the Big Four local banks' prime rate. Is this not too high? The prime rate as at today, I think, is 6.29%. Compare this with the CPF rate, which is about 5.38%, I would like to ask the Minister, in view of the difference in the rates, whether the parents of these students will be allowed to use their CPF rather than having to take a loan from the University loan fund? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, with regard to the first question, what happens should the fund run out? Let me just say that the present provision of $100 million is much more than adequate for the next few years. For 1987/88 I think the total amount is not estimated to be more than $20 million to $25 million. So the $100 million fund will be more than sufficient for the foreseeable future. And if that is not enough, then as I said before, Sir, we must make sure that more funds will be available. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is the interest rate. Fixed at the banks' prime rate, is it not too high in relation to the CPF rate? And if that is the case, should parents not be allowed to use their CPF rather than take a Government loan? Well, Sir, CPF is not within my province. I would not presume to announce policies which are under the proper supervision of another Minister. Perhaps the Minister for Labour might like to comment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I ask of the Hon. Minister for Education five \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> questions relating to his Ministerial Statement. (1) Could he enlighten the House as to the cost for students in the Dental and Medical faculties? (2) Why try to recover only 9% in this respect and not, say, 12% or 15%? (3) What is the rationale for getting only 9% in return? (4) For how long will this increase be applicable, and (5) Will there be another upward review of fees in the foreseeable future? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the Member's first question is on the cost of educating each student in the Medical and Dental faculties. The operating cost now is in the region of over $40,000 per student each year in the Medical and Dental faculties. The second and third questions relate to why we fix the cost recovery rate of 9% as against 16% for the non-laboratory based faculties and 15% for the laboratory based faculties. Sir, I agree that it will be more equitable to have them all at the same rate, say, 15% or 16%. But this would mean that we will have to raise the fees for the medical students, perhaps by four or five times. I think it is quite high. I did consider it but, as you can see, the fees are already quite high. Perhaps we should take a bit of time before we raise it to the same level as the other faculties, although I agree with the Member that in all fairness there is no reason why students studying Medicine or Dentistry should, in principle, enjoy a higher subsidy than those studying in the other faculties. But it is best not to try and do too much at one stage and I think this can be adjusted over a period of time. But I will keep in mind what the Member has just raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and fifth question is how long will this increase last and whether there will be another upward increase in future years? Sir, I have always taken the view that in terms of education and in terms of fees, one should not try to rush things. This increase was necessary and, as I have explained to Members, it has taken us some two years to work out a scheme which, I believe, is now fair and workable. I would hope to allow these fees to settle down for one or two years. We may have to make a small increase in 1988 but I would not like to see another major increase coming too soon after this one. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I notice, by this increase of fees, there will be a saving of at least $28 million which has to be paid for by tuition fees. Will this benefit go to the junior colleges and technical institutions? You said here, \"Do they pay less over the other side?\" That is one question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice the fee increase is almost twice or three times. Is there a necessity for this big jump, rather than increase it by stages? The third question is: what is the position of our Malay students? Do they still get their benefits under our Constitution? The fourth question is this. I have been told that some foreign students are currently getting half-grants from our local University. What is their position then? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: why are we charging the foreign students rather low tuition fees at only 50% extra when compared to our own students? When you go to foreign universities, you find that their own students go into their universities almost free, with a lot of liberal grants, but foreign students are charged probably 10 times the amount. So why are we charging only 50% more? Can we not charge our own students less and, perhaps, increase the fees for foreign students? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, with regard to the first question from the Member for Potong Pasir, there is no saving of $28 million. The $28 million is required by the University to meet its operating expenses for 1987/88. So the University will not be saving any money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the reason for the size of the jump or the increase in the fees. I have already explained that we would like to reduce the subsidy for university education over a period of time so as to be able to spend more on education in our schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and VITB where the majority of our students are. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with regard to the question about Malay students, they will enjoy the privileges specified in the Constitution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the question about foreign students with half-grants. I am not quite sure about that point. Perhaps the Member might be referring to students who are on university scholarships. If he can let me \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have the details, then I will give him the reply. Would that be all right? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I understand that foreign students are given half-grants, and they have to sign a bond whereby they have to work in Singapore for at least three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> No, that is not true then. In that case, there are no foreign students who have been given half-grants. All foreign students are bonded to work in Singapore for three years after they graduate. If they do not work in Singapore, then they have got to pay back essentially the full cost of their university education here, which is at a very much higher rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question is, why should we not raise tuition fees for foreign students much more than the current 50% more than our own local students, and thereby charge our local students less? Sir, this comes back to the point which I made at the end of my ministerial statement. We are a small talent pool here, Sir. We must, first of all, make sure that any local student who has the ability and the talent to make it to university will be enabled to do so. And here, Sir, the very generous loan scheme provided by the Government will make it possible for any local Singapore student, no matter what his or her circumstances are, to attend University if he or she can qualify. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I would not like to have fees for foreign students fixed at so high a rate that we discourage very bright talented foreign students from joining our University here. In addition to supplementing our own talent pool, Sir, I think they are a benefit to our own University students. I have explained on many previous occasions that with all our students coming from the same type of social and home backgrounds, it is useful for them to mix with students from other countries, students who have had other experiences of life, so that our students can broaden their outlook and thereby acquire a good University education. Furthermore, all foreign students who study at NUS and NTI are required to work in Singapore for three years after they have graduated and in that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> case supplementing the number of skilled people which we have to service our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the Minister's reply on the subsidy for students of medicine and dentistry, where the absolute figures of subsidy are larger and the recovery rate is smaller, may I ask the Minister whether he has figures, say, over the last 10 years, of the number of our citizens who have been trained by our University in medicine and dental surgery; and how many of these are presently practising in Singapore. It appears that we are spending most on those students who have the greatest ease of emigration to other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister said that the granting of these loans will be on a very liberal basis. One can presume that a lot of students will be asking for loans; even foreign students. Therefore, I can foresee that there will be a high cost of collection of these loans, since they allow a maximum of 15 years to repay. May I therefore ask the Minister whether these costs have been worked into the scheme. In this regard, I would like to echo the Member for Ayer Rajah's call on the Minister to try and persuade his Cabinet colleague to allow the use of CPF funds because, according to the Minister for Education, money spent on education is investment whereas, according to the Minister for Labour, money spent on education is consumption. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, with regard to the first question as to the numbers who have been educated in medicine or dentistry over the last 10 years, I do not have the information at hand here. I will obtain them and give them to the Member. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to whether the cost of recovering the loans will be high, I think it will be. We did take that into consideration. We have thought of making the loan conditions somewhat more strict by perhaps requiring two guarantors who must be approved by the University. But, Sir, this is the first time that we are moving to this new system and, on balance, we should make the loan scheme as liberal as possible. If, in the light of experience later on, we have to modify some of the condi- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tions, this question can always be considered. But as the first step, we should make it as liberal and as easy as possible for students to get loans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question raised by the Member and also by the Member for Ayer Rajah regarding CPF. Obviously, Sir, these points raised by Backbenchers will be taken note by the Government. I am sure the Minister for Labour will consider it very seriously. I will discuss the matter with him and eventually a paper will go to Cabinet. What the result is, I do not know. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the question of CPF for education has been raised again, may I be allowed to respond? I have previously explained at some length to the House what the Government's thinking on CPF is, and that is, to confine the CPF scheme to its basic objectives. These are housing, Medisave and a minimum retirement income. If we confine the CPF scheme to these three basic objectives and do not allow ourselves to stray into all kinds of areas, we will then be able to avoid having too high a CPF rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now studying the CPF rate. What should be the long-term rate? If we want to allow CPF to be used for education, it means we must have a higher CPF rate. But the thinking of the Government now is to keep the CPF rate not too high because otherwise the economy might not be able to afford it. Also, CPF members will then have more take-home pay, more savings of their own, more funds at their disposal for whatever uses they want to use the money for. For example, they might want to use their extra income for education. If we were to concede that CPF should also be used for education, then we will have to increase the CPF rate for everybody whereas only some members will need to use the CPF for educational purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced by the Minister for Education, the Government has already decided on a very generous loan scheme to finance those students who are able to make it to University. I think there will be no problem for these students, once they graduate, to repay these loans which will amount in most cases, other than those in dentistry or medicine, to only a few thousand \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dollars. There should be no problem for them to repay these amounts from their future income once they start to work. Therefore, there is no need for us to widen the CPF scheme to provide for educational expenses. This is a fundamental point. I do not want to go and debate about whether CPF for education is for consumption or for investment. The point we should ask ourselves is: what is the CPF for? Is it for education? Is it for retirement? Is it for housing? What is it for? In the past, the tendency has been to add more and more uses to the CPF. Every time there is a problem where some funds are needed, you go to CPF. As a result, the CPF rate has become higher and higher. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that was raised is: why do we not allow the parents to extend the loan from their CPF to the children? I think the more basic question is: should we allow CPF for education at all? Because once we allow CPF to be used as educational loans, where do we stop? Do we then allow CPF to be used for education without repayment? Should we allow it to be used for overseas education? Where do we draw the line? My fear is, once we concede to this point, we will be opening Pandora's box and again allowing CPF to go into areas which are alien to the objectives of the CPF scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I ask the Minister for Education whether or not one of the intentions of his Ministry, in increasing the fees as well as providing this loan, is to impress upon our young citizens in the University that the State is paying quite a great deal for their education and that when they graduate they are to pay back part of that cost to the University? If that is not one of the intentions, should it not be one of the intentions? If that is the intention, is it not wrong to suggest that the parents' CPF be used for this purpose? Because the buck will be passed to the parents and not to the students. I think the intention is to impress upon the students that the State is already paying so much for their education - \"This is part of your cost and you must bear this responsibility.\" So I would like to ask the Minister: is this one of the intentions and, if not, should this not be one of the intentions in his move to raise the fee and have this loan scheme? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Moulmein is absolutely right. It is important to impress on our University students that they are a very privileged lot and that their very expensive education has been very heavily subsidized by the Government at the expense of other taxpayers. As I have said in my statement, Sir, University students when they graduate can aspire to be members of very highly paid professions. And it is only fair that, after they have had the benefit of a University education subsidized by the Government, they should pay back part of the subsidy after they have graduated. In this case, I think that one good result out of this increase of university fees is that we will have a very responsible student population at NUS and at NTI. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Questions for the Minister. Is there any particular reason why the polytechnics are exempted from this exercise? The other question is: this exercise will help the University to recover 12% of the operating cost, an improvement of 4% compared to the 8% of what is recovered. Will the cost of administrative machinery set up to manage this $100 million fund eat into a large portion of the 4% saved as a result of this? In other words, is it worth it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I will first respond to the question raised by the Member for Ayer Rajah regarding the polytechnics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fixing tuition fees at a certain percentage of the recurrent cost per student studying in the various courses is a new principle which has not hitherto been applied in Singapore. Like all innovations affecting our educational institutions, I am inclined to take a cautious approach and confine the application of this new principle to the NUS and to the NTI, at least for the next few years until the system settles down and any transitional difficulties have been resolved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the polytechnics, I note that the polytechnics' three-year diploma courses are designed mainly for an intake consisting of '0' level students. About 90% of the intake of the polytechnics are '0' level students. The polytechnics draw their students essentially from the same pool of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> '0' level students as the pre-university centres and the junior colleges. And each year the polytechnics participate in the Ministry of Education joint admission exercise together with the pre-unviersity centres and the junior colleges. The role of the polytechnics is to produce technicians and middle-level personnel for our economy. As institutions of post-secondary education, the polytechnics are mid-way between the NUS and the NTI and the pre-university centres and junior colleges. The operating cost per student, which is about $6,000 at the polytechnics, is more than double the operating cost per student, about $2,700, in our junior colleges but it is much lower than the operating cost per student, about $14,400 as I have just mentioned, at NUS and NTI. Presently the Government subsidizes about 83% of the operating cost for each student at our polytechnics. With better starting ratios and a greater variety of courses, it is not possible to keep polytechnic tuition fees at an unchanged level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, with stringent cost control at the two polytechnics, I am of the view that the polytechnics should hold down any increase in fees to a much lower level than the average increase of 20% per annum which was the case for the last three years, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one other question on the administrative cost. Sir, the University will be discussing with a number of banks as to whether they can help the University to administer this particular loan scheme. We will try and keep the cost as low as possible. I think the net result is that it will be worth the exercise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, interest rates as we know fluctuate, and while it is low, I think nobody will complain. But interest rates can go up to 8%, 9%, 10%, even double digit figures. Would the Minister not consider lessening the burden on the students by fixing the interest rate at a special low rate, instead of pegging it to the commercial interest rate? I am sure he will agree with me that Government's objective is not to make more money out of the money that it lends to its students. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, it is because interest rates fluctuate that we are fixing the interest rate on the loan to the prime rate. We have seen the consequences of having fixed rates and the complications that always arise, whether it is for housing loan or for any type of loan. You are in a no-win situation. Whatever rate you fix, if the commercial rate goes up, then of course the students are quite happy but then the rate will rapidly go out of line. If the commercial rate is lower than your fixed rate, then there would be a tremendous clamour and great accusations of unfairness to the Government. I think, Sir, that we have paid a very heavy price to learn this and we have changed the various rates for Government loans to fluctuation rate tied to the prime rate. I believe that this is very fair and, in fact, it is unusual for anybody to be able to get a small loan from a bank, as the Member will know, at prime rate. Fixing the interest rate on the loans at the average of the prime rates charged by the Big Four local banks is already, in my view, a very large concession from the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I think the Minister has missed my point. What I meant was an interest rate which is very low and very special, lower than what the prime rate will ever fall. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I think that question should properly be directed to the Minister for Finance. I would not advise him to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, if you will ask your Question No. 1, the Prime Minister will answer it now. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION NO. 1</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>THE TEH CHEANG WAN AFFAIR</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Public Inquiry)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will call a public inquiry to get to the bottom of the Teh Cheang Wan Affair and to make recommendations to prevent further corruption at high places. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is ready to have a public inquiry into any matter of public interest \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> so that there can be no question of any cover-up.

Now, in order to frame the terms of reference of a public inquiry, will the Member for Potong Pasir please spell out what he means by \"the Teh Cheang Wan Affair\"? You must have terms of reference. If I have a term of reference which says, \"public inquiry into the Teh Cheang Wan Affair\" - what is it about? The CPIB has two charges against Mr Teh Cheang Wan. The Member for Potong Pasir has included these, I presume, in the word \"affair\", but he includes much more.

The Prime Minister has told the House that no other persons were implicated. Then we read in the papers that there was this contractor who was charged or at least he was under investigation at the moment. Of course, we would want to know the system that is now being employed by the Ministry of National Development in relation to acquisition/alienation of land, tenders and perhaps \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> also its own companies and related companies that do business with the MND. These are of public interest.

But I warn him, or perhaps I should caution him, that I will meet him all the way, every inch of the way. Because this is the way I have run the Government. First, about the two charges of corruption. Why? In my view, he is completely misconceived. When there is wrongdoing of corruption, one does not have an open inquiry which will prejudice, first, evidence being unearthed; second, accused persons being prejudiced. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to interrupt. This is Question Time and the Prime Minister goes off again and I suppose the Leader of the House has to suspend Standing Orders. Is he a Member of the House? I am not allowed to make a speech. Is he answering or is he making a long speech? This is Question Time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> But I was meeting his question! He has forgotten that he has suggested that amongst the terms of inquiry were the two bribes of $800,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Let us have the answers. Don't threaten me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am not threatening him, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am just telling him that those two items cannot form the subject of a commission of inquiry. Where there are specific instances of corruption, they must be thoroughly and properly investigated in order that charges can be brought and persons punished. One does not have a commission of inquiry because in that way the evidence will vanish. Secondly, accused persons will claim that they have been unfairly prejudiced by the hearings of a public inquiry before their trial. So in these two particular cases, there can be no inquiry because the cases are still being pursued. We can have the inquiry when the cases have been completed through the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not say that there was no other wrongdoing. I said \"persons who are outside the jurisdiction.\" There was no other wrongdoing by any other members of the Government in the Ministry or any Government officers in the Ministry of National Development. I chose my words carefully. Now if he has suspicions that there are wrong procedures over tenders or Government companies being mismanaged and milked for funds, draft the terms of reference. There will be a commission of inquiry led by a High Court Judge. The Member can give evidence. He can lead the evidence and produce them. This Government is prepared to meet him all the way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister himself is a qualified Advocate and he knows that the wrongdoer is now dead.

And he says whether or not we have --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I ask him to desist before he blunders wildly into more assertions of law which are totally unfounded? Mr Teh Cheang Wan is dead. But he was not the only wrongdoer. A bribe consists of the giver and the taker besides any intermediaries who facilitated either the giving or the taking. That the ultimate taker has died does not mean that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there are others who cannot be charged and will be charged. There is one particular person who is now in Macau because we do not have extradition treaty with Macau. But there is no reason why we should throw away the prospect of a prosecution by having this blown in a commission of inquiry and allowing the prosecution to lapse. There is also the case of the contractor who tried to suborn evidence and that will be proceeded with. There is nothing which is embarrassing to the Government which needs to be hidden. The Member will have full access to this data either in a commission of inquiry or in a proper trial. Draft your terms of reference. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is something new that the Prime Minister has brought up.

I cannot make him the chairman of the commission because he has not shown the degree of perspicacity and acuity which will lead to definitive conclusions. We will be rambling all over Singapore looking for files which have no relevance to the case. But this is a serious offer. Settle the terms of reference. I will be back here at 2.30 pm.

I have to say that I did not take the opportunity in this lunch break to draft this. In fact, I had this all the time from this morning. The only thing I did was to photostat a copy of the Inquiry Commissions Act. Apparently section 10 therein does not prevent an Inquiry from being convened despite the fact that there are relevant pending cases, because it says here, under the heading \"Use of evidence in civil and criminal proceedings.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No evidence taken under this Act shall be admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings whatsoever against the person who gave such evidence, except when such person is charged with giving or fabricating false evidence.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Prime Minister wants to, he could recommend to the President to issue \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a Commission to investigate on what we were speaking of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here the terms of reference which I had drafted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1. To investigate: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) on the circumstances which made it possible for the late Minister for National Development to accept the $800,000 bribes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) whether other persons were involved or implicated in giving the $800,000 bribes or other bribes, if any. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The system employed by the Ministry of National Development in (a) acquisition/alienation of land; (b) granting of tenders; (c) its operations of its and related companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If the Commissioner finds on the evidence that there are shortcomings in the system employed by MND and/or any of its related organizations and companies, it shall receive proposals and make recommendations for their improvement and to prevent further corruption.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these terms of reference are enough to have an inquiry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can I have a copy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Unfortunately I scribbled it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> We can photostat it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, we can photostat it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would suggest that if the Prime Minister is ready to have this public inquiry, I think there should be more than one commissioner, preferably three. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Can I have a copy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will get it photostated. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whilst the document is being photostated, speaking from my aural recollection of what was said, he specified the $800,000; any other bribes that might have been taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> If any. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> If any. Somebody must lead evidence. I presume he will. Acquisition or alienation of land which arose or which is connected with the two bribes. Then he mentioned tenders and other procedures. What have the tenders got to do with the corruption? Because the tenders have not led to any corruption. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important area of the MND. They are calling tenders worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

They were all in one branch. He did not say, from my recollection of what was just read, that there was another branch of the terms of reference - to see if there was any possibility of corruption in public tenders. Is that what he is aiming at? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think one of the very important areas as far as the MND is concerned is the system used by this very important Ministry. And I think the system definitely includes tenders. In fact, one of the key activities of this Ministry is to give out tenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> As I read the document now, it is: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"1.

What does that mean? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the Ministry of National Development owns companies which prepare materials to build HDB flats. I believe it owns companies, and I believe there are other companies which are related to the MND. So in one, ownership of companies; in another area, companies that have got relations with the MND. So there are two aspects to that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I suggest he takes a little more time and puts it in coherent language. I am taking this proposition absolutely on face value. There will be a Commission of Inquiry. We will follow these terms of reference if they are relevant; and if they are not relevant, the Commissioner may find that it is not relevant, and he may be out. So I suggest that he sits down and puts his thoughts together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is making a serious proposition which we take seriously. He is asking that public expenditure be incurred for three Commissioners to make these investigations of matters of an important public nature. Two of them, the first one concerns the two bribes which are the subject of pending proceedings, either pending in the courts or pending the arrest of certain persons. The others I do not see the connection between tenders and operations of other related companies and the bribes that were given or alleged to have been given. Is he asking the Commission to inquire into the system whether it is possible, whether it invites bribery? What is it? Well, say so. It is your Commission. You are asking for it. Let's investigate. [Interruption] That is not the meaning of the words he has put down. I am prepared to accept his words and gazette them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I heard it correctly, the Prime Minister is willing to hold a public commission, and I am glad to hear that. If he wants to, I could redraft this and put it, in his own words, a better crafted form and present it for the Gazette, as he says. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I assume that the Member will lead evidence. Because we have not seen the need for this Inquiry. We have made departmental inquiries to see whether any changes have been made to procedures which might lead to corruption. The new Minister for National Development has been going through all the procedures in the last two months. The Member suspects that there is something. I asssume that he is going to lead the evidence and all the files will be made available to him. Nothing will be denied him. But we are not having this Commission of Inquiry in order that we will com- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mission somebody to produce evidence of wrongdoing or possible wrongdoing when we have not found any. So the Member will lead evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already evidence, a hefty sum of $800,000 has been taken. And as far as the other evidence is concerned, it will have to be related to the system employed. And we have already in fact, evidence that strange goings-on have taken place. A piece of land has been acquired and it is the most strange phenomenon because I have done acquisition of land cases that, in fact, the land was returned to the owner. This is indeed very, very strange. So I think there is need for an inquiry into that area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have already admitted or said I understood him when he said he wanted to inquire about acquisition and alienation of land because that is connected with the bribery. It is manifest from the evidence that have been placed. But he is now going on to say that granting of tenders and its operations of its and related companies. How is that relevant? But I am happy to take it as it is and to gazette it because I will not stop any Inquiry. It will be gazetted. I am just asking him now to decide whether he has really put down what suspicions he has in mind, and he will lead evidence on it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not talking of suspicions. We are talking of actual wrong-doings. He certainly knows that there is already a member of the core contractors who is willing to give a bribe of $1 million. It is no small sum. There must be certainly something behind that. I do not think the least reason we can think of is out of friendship. So I think there is something to be looked at as far as tenders are concerned. There is no doubt about that. If we dig deep enough, we will find the evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Will he spell that out? To investigate why a core contractor offered $1 million to suborn a witness and whether it was because the system of tenders gave him an advantage so it was worth his while to offer this $1 million. Spell it out. We will investigate it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think my terms are good enough. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> But it is not in the terms of reference. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We could look into it because tenders cover every area that is concerned with tenders. I do not think we want to go into details and tie our hands. I think we should really give ourselves some flexibility. I think these terms are sufficient. If the Prime Minister is willing to gazette them, I will give my permission by all means to do so. If there is such a commission, not only I will lead in evidence but I have certainly people who are willing to assist me in that area. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I accept the proposition. It may sound bizarre. It is absurd. I should, by way of illustration, by way of not being accused of taking advantage of the somewhat patchy knowledge of commissions of inquiry by the Member for Potong Pasir, that terms of reference are drawn with considerable care and precision. If I may read him the terms of reference for the Commission of Inquiry to investigate the allegations made in this House by the former Member for Anson. There were four limbs: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'AND WHEREAS I am of the opinion that it would be for the public welfare that an inquiry should forthwith be made by the Commissioner so appointed in accordance with the following terms of reference, namely: [That is the whole of the preamble \"Whereas I am of the opinion ... namely:] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to investigate the evidence upon which Mr J B Jeyaretnam based his allegation in Parliament on the 10th day of January, 1986 that the executive arm of Government had on at least three occasions ...; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to investigate the evidence upon which Mr J B Jeyaretnam, MP for Anson, based his allegation ...; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to decide if there was any truth in these allegations ...; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if the Commissioner finds, on the evidence, that the transfers were due to or caused by interference by the executive arm ... to receive proposals as to how the existing system and procedure as provided in Article 111 of the Constitution relating to the Legal Service Commission and its duties and functions can be improved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, I, ... appoint ...'. \n  <br>\n  <br>I will accept the Member for Potong Pasir's proposition. He wants this gazetted. I will recommend to the President that this brainwave of the Member for Potong Pasir be gazetted.

In the note to the Supplementary Main Estimates, it is said that the payment is necessary because there were two loans in default in the current financial year, ie, loans which were reinsured by the Ministry of Finance. I should have thought, Sir, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that the default would not be in the two loans but possibly default by the importer in the foreign country. I just want to know how this default comes about and why is it necessary that there should be a shortfall of something like $28 million, out of which we are now being asked to vote for a supplementary provision of $15 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would like to pass, in respect of Head N and Head W. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, the two loans referred to in Paper Cmd. 3 of 1987 were buyer credits extended by a syndicate of banks to overseas buyers to purchase goods and services from Singapore exporters. The banks paid to Singapore exporters immediately after the delivery of the goods and services and the overseas buyers will repay the banks over several years. To assure the banks of a repayment of the buyer credits, the Singapore exporters paid ECICS (Export Credit Insurance Corporation of Singapore) premium to get ECICS to issue buyer credit guarantees to the banks. By an arrangement with ECICS, called the Export Credit Reinsurance Scheme, the Ministry of Finance reinsured part of the risks borne by ECICS in insuring the two buyer credits and collected some premiums from ECICS. When the two buyer credits for the two oil rigs went into default, ECICS paid the banks its liability under the two buyer credit guarantees and the Ministry of Finance paid ECICS a share of the liability under the Export Credit Reinsurance Scheme. This is a technical explanation for the two loans but I think some background information may be useful for Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980 Government entered into an arrangement to refinance or reinsure insurance risks undertaken by ECICS which is an export credit insurance company. This reinsurance procedure was necessary in order to finance the export of large capital goods from Singapore, primarily oil rigs and oil service-related equipment which were rather expensive. At that time Singapore, in fact, had developed into the second largest rig exporter in the world. And its rig exports were competing with rigs manufactured \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> worldwide. The reinsurance and the insurance of such buyer credits is a common worldwide procedure adopted by most exporting countries who wanted to compete in this area of capital intensive exports. The arrangement was terminated in 1982 after two years because the Government found that the liability risk was excessive and it felt that the oil rig industry had matured sufficiently by that time to stand on its own. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, do you wish to withdraw your amendment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> In view of the Minister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,000,000 for Head N ordered to stand part of the First Supplementary Main Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April, 1986 to 31st March, 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head W - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead WA-02-5111(07) of the Main Estimates.* \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, firstly, may I thank the Government in general, and the Hon. Minister for Finance in particular, for heeding the call for an upward revision of the 1982 Singapore Allowance. This $25 increase, as I stated last year, was equal to 33 1/3%, that is, from $75 to $100. I am quite sure that those Government pensioners who benefited from this increase were indeed grateful for it. In short, the Government was quick to respond to the request, and therefore this provision of $1.75 million is needed. Here, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister for Finance whether he would indicate the number of Government pensioners who stand to benefit from this upward revision. In this respect also, what is the percentage of the total number of Government pensioners as a whole? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can dispute the fact that the Government pensioners have contributed much to the progress and prosperity of our modern Singapore, particularly in the last \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 30 years or so, although some quarters have alleged that they are a forgotten lot and that the Government does not care for them. Sir, I do not agree with that view because this increase in the 1982 Singapore Allowance speaks for itself. However, if recognition of their contribution means that they should be invited to public functions in a representative manner, and I believe there is the Singapore Government Pensioners' Association, then I agree that consideration be given such as issuing invitations to them to attend some of the National Celebrations, for example, the National Day Parade or the National Day Reception hosted by the President. If this is the case, then I think it is not asking too much. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area, Sir, where I think recognition can be given, and that is, Government should consider reviewing the medical benefits for Government pensioners, particularly hospitalization benefits and attendance at outdoor dispensaries or polyclinics. I am given to understand that older people, with due respect, Sir, tend to have more ailments and require more medical attention. If the range of medical benefits to the Government pensioners can be reviewed, then I think this is another positive way to reflect Government's concern and care for these Government pensioners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for Punggol for his kind words because he has been one of the leading proponents for suggesting this increase, and I can understand his concern for the pensioners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the question he has raised, the increase in the Singapore Allowance benefited 7,850 pensioners, or 91% of the 8,634 pensioners who are still resident in Singapore. So the majority have, in fact, benefited from this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his question of invitations for pensioners to attend public functions, this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> indeed is something which we have already asked the various Ministries and other bodies to do. Invitations are, in fact, being considered and letters have gone out in the form of circulars requesting such invitations in July this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his final question on the possibility of reviewing medical benefits, I regret it is not possible at this time to do so because medical benefits are not reviewed independently of those for serving officers. Pensioners generally enjoy the same medical benefits as they had just prior to retirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the reply of the Hon.

Therefore, Sir, I would like to know how many primary and secondary schools have been completed under such a programme; where are they located; what kind of facilities would be available? Sir, this question is asked particularly in anticipation of our secondary schools becoming single session schools in the very near future, as explained by the Minister for Education earlier on. What will be the enrolment in these schools? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the junior colleges, Sir, I would like to know how the sum of $924,000 could have helped to accelerate the development programme. I know that one junior college is supposed to be built in Hougang, as indicated by the then Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education who is now Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information, and this is contained in col. 1471 of Hansard, 26th March, 1985. But, indeed, I am unhappy to say that there is no sign of it being built as yet, let alone any activity that seems to indicate that the said junior college is being built. Hence, I have put in a Question for Oral Answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not trying to be impertinent in raising this matter but I merely wish to know what and where these junior colleges are. In the larger context of the building programme strategy for schools and junior colleges, I want to know if more funds will be needed and made available to increase the facilities and make for better amenities in the next few years. This, I believe, is necessary to give further impetus to a realization of the objective of a better qualitative education through conversion to single session schools, particularly the secondary schools. Sir, in making these observations, I take note of what the Hon. Minister for Education has mentioned earlier at this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to speak very briefly on new secondary schools and on the independent schools. I suppose secondary schools will be related \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the independent schools. I have just a short enquiry for the Minister. I heard that one of the schools that will shortly be converted into an independent school is the Anglo-Chinese School which I am proud to say is where I come from. Will the old boys of the school, which play a big role in the development of that school, have a say in the conversion from its present government aided school status to that of an independent school? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the number of enrolment will be limited to 1,200. This school has an enrolment of something like 7,200 which, of course, also includes the primary school. But however you look at it, there will be a diminution of numbers. So what will happen to the other students who are not included in this 1,200? I would like to know that. This is a very brief point which I would like the Minister to clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first take up the queries raised up by the Member for Punggol. Under the present school and junior college building programme, there are 23 primary schools, 14 secondary schools and two junior colleges under construction. The supplementary funds amounting to $13.4 million are required to meet the increased expenditure on progress payments owing to the acceleration of the building programmes. As a result of the accelerated pace of construction, the completion of three schools will be advanced from 1988 to 1987. The schools involved are, first, a secondary school at Bishan Site 1 which has been advanced from January 1988 to April 1987; a secondary school at Hougang Site 1, from February 1988 to November 1987; and a secondary school at Bukit Batok Site 7, from February 1988 to November 1987. During FY 86, there has also been better progress of building works on all other school building projects. Hence progress payments fell due earlier and additional funds are required to meet these payments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the schools in the Punggol/Hougang zone. In 1986, the demand for schools within the Punggol/Hougang zone was adequately met by the existing 20 primary and 15 secondary schools, including aided \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> schools. Three new Government primary and four secondary schools were completed during 1986. Another four schools are due for completion in 1987. Two secondary schools are located at Serangoon; one primary and one secondary school at Hougang. All recently completed schools and the schools currently under construction are built to prevailing standards and specifications which, of course, are double sessions as at present. The planned enrolments at present for the standard schools are 2,330 pupils for each primary school and 1,890 pupils for each secondary school. These may be revised if the single session school concept is adopted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hougang Junior College is earmarked for development in 1987 and scheduled for completion in 1989/90. The present planned student enrolment for a junior college is 1,200 students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the query from the Member for Potong Pasir, as I have said, when a school wants to go independent, the initiative must come from the school itself. So in the case of ACS, not only will the old boys have a say, I would expect them to take the initiative in converting ACS from a Government-aided school to an independent school if they want this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the school enrolment, it depends on the plan which is put up by the old boys. I have not seen the plan yet. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What would happen to the rest of the pupils? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> I do not think we should anticipate the question. I said the plan must come from the school community. They have not presented me with a plan yet. I do not think we should prejudice their case at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I thank the Hon. Minister for his kind replies and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,733,000 for Head L ordered to stand part of the First Supplementary Development Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1st April, 1986 to 31st March, 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head R - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head R be reduced by $10 in respect of Subhead RL-01-8201. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the rationale for the National Productivity Board to have its own building. It would seem to be the fashion nowadays for every Ministry and every statutory board to have its own building. I wonder to what extent this desire to have its own building has led to the present glut in office and commercial buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering this question on behalf of the Minister for Labour, because the National Productivity Board was transferred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry last year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board Building is not a new project. Funds were first allocated for it in FY 84. The project is taking four years to complete, at a total estimated cost of $55 million. We are within the budget. What has happened is that there has been a slippage of the building schedule. Money which was voted two years ago in FY 85 could not be spent because there was a delay in construction. Therefore the money has to be committed in FY 86, and that is the sum which you see. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the general rationale for the NPB Building, I should say that this is not an office building. It is a purpose-built building which is meant to provide a focal point for the training efforts of the National Productivity Board in the national productivity movement. It includes up-to-date facilities like training rooms, seminar rooms, language laboratory, auditorium, a studio to make audio-visual programmes and a library of productivity related materials. So the NPB Building has a well defined and justifiable purpose. It will allow the NPB to train about 15,000 people a year. By this year, utilization of the building will be approaching 75%. So I think it is a building justified on its own merit and not prejudiced by any possible over-supply of accommodation space in the commercial sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am not convinced by the Minister's argument. Why can't an existing building be bought and converted to suit the purposes of the National Productivity Board?

This is not a new project. Funds were voted in FY 84. Funds were voted in FY85. Funds were voted in FY 86.

Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will make certain reforms to the law relating to damages payable in cases of fatal accidents. This is necessary because of a change in the law brought about by a judicial decision in the United Kingdom House of Lords in 1981. Similar amendments have been made to the laws of other countries such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1981, when a person died in a fatal accident caused by the negligent act of another person, the wrongdoer was liable to compensate - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the deceased's estate for the deceased's loss of expectation of life; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to compensate the dependants of the deceased for the loss sustained by them on account of his death, what is known as \"loss of dependency\" claim; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, any additional disbursements incurred by any person or the deceased's estate on account of the accident. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income which the deceased would have earned had he not died was not a part of the damages payable by the wrongdoer. In other words, damages for what is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> known in the legal jargon as the \"lost years\" could not be claimed by the deceased's estate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the law on this was changed in 1981 when the United Kingdom House of Lords decided the case known as Gammel v. Wilson. The House of Lords in that case decided that damages for the \"lost years\" could be claimed by the estate of a person killed in a fatal accident. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That case was followed by our Court of Appeal in 1982 because it was based on the interpretation of a United Kingdom statutory provision which is similar in all respects to section 8(2) of our Civil Law Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain undesirable consequences may arise from this changed state of the law: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, double compensation may be payable in cases where the deceased's dependants are not also beneficiaries of the deceased's estate. The wrongdoer may have to pay damages to both the deceased's estate for \"lost years\" and to his dependants for their \"loss of dependency\", a result which surely cannot be acceptable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where the deceased has no dependants, other persons, eg, distant relatives, may receive a \"windfall\" and be unjustly enriched by such an award. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the estate claim for the \"lost years\" is often higher than the \"loss of dependency\" claim. In some cases, dependants may obtain damages which are more than their actual loss of dependency. Such cases include cases where the dependants are already elderly and are likely to have died before the deceased person had he not met with a premature death in an accident. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need to reform this unsatisfactory state of the law was recognized by the House of Lords in the case of Gammell itself. Nearly all the judges in Gammell's case called for legislative intervention. So too in our own Court of Appeal, quote Mr Justice Lai who called for reform, \"It is in the province of our legislature to reform the law.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill will reverse the law as stated in Gammell's case by abolishing the right of a deceased person's estate to recover damages for the \"lost years\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the other amendments in the Bill. In determining damages payable to a person on account of a fatal accident, our courts usually award a sum of about $6,500 for \"loss of expectation of life\". This award is usually regarded as a \"solatium\", a consolation, to the close relatives of the deceased. But in law it is awarded to the estate of the deceased. Thus it can also be claimed if the deceased does not have any close relatives. To rectify this anomaly, clause 3 of the Bill will abolish the claims for damages for loss of expectation of life. In its place the new section 12A of the Bill creates a right to claim a fixed sum of $10,000 for \"bereavement\" which can be claimed only for the benefit of certain very close relatives. If the deceased does not leave behind any such close relatives, no such award will be made to his estate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment, as mentioned, Sir, the dependants of the deceased person can always claim for loss of dependency. However, at present the law recognizes only a few categories of persons as dependants for this purpose. Only the spouse, parent, grandparent, child, stepchild and grandchild of the deceased are eligible to claim for loss of dependency. Under our existing law, other relatives who are actually dependent on the deceased but who do not fall within these narrow categories cannot claim for loss of dependency, eg. brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. In order to prevent undue hardship or injustice, the Bill seeks to extend the categories of dependants to also include - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece and first cousin of the deceased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) child treated by the deceased and his wife as a child of their family; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) great-grandchild or great-grandparent of the deceased. \n  <br>\n  <br>I need to add, Sir, that to succeed in any such claim for dependency a person must not only fall within the categories of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dependency which we have now enlarged, but must also be able to prove to the court that he was actually financially dependent on the deceased person. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, this Bill is rather technical but it is necessary and it is, in fact, a response to a suggestion for reform made by the Judiciary itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.37 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I name the first available sitting after 1st April 1987 for the Second Reading of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STANDING ORDERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S.

The reductions are consequential to the implementation of the 1987 wage restraint measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation for Entertainment is increased by $1,600 because of higher anticipated expenditure on receptions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $331,100 is required to meet Expenses of the Istana household.

No sector of the economy was spared. Overall, our GDP shrank by 1.8% in 1985, and about 00,000 jobs were lost. The recession continued into the first quarter of 1986. Companies were still folding and retrenchments continued, apparently unabated, with no prospect of recovery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government acted swiftly. Various cost-cutting and fiscal measures recommended by the Economic Committee were implemented. They represented important policy changes that decisively improved our competitiveness. The lowering of employer's CPF contribution rate to 10%, the substantial reductions statutory charges and other costs, and the 50% cut in property taxes all helped to reduce operating costs and improve company profitability. Other measures designed to stimulate the economy and restore business confidence included rebates on personal income taxes, increased Government spending on infrastructural projects and a lowering of the corporate tax rate to 33% with effect from Year of Assessment 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>PERFORMANCE IN 1986</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures have paid off. How successful they have been is evident from the performance of the economy in 1986. The details can be found in the Annual Economic Survey which has already been released. I will therefore only highlight the salient points: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The economy grew by 1.9% in 1986. This was an improvement over 1985, and was also better than our earlier projection of zero growth; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The employment situation too has brightened. Overall, 11,000 jobs (net) were created in 1986. Unemployment, which reached a high of 6.5% in June 1986, fell to 4.6% in December 1986; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Our non-oil domestic exports grew by 20% in 1986, compared to the 4% decline in 1985; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Investment commitments reached $1.4 billion, a 27% growth over 1985, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> although still less than the $1.8 billion registered in 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these statistics must be interpreted with circumspection. They merely indicate that taken as a whole, the economy is recovering from the recession. But the recovery is not across the board. Not all the sectors of the economy have recovered or are doing well. Only manufacturing and transport and communications, which make up about half the economy, are performing satisfactorily. We must therefore not throw caution to the wind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recovery of our manufacturing sector was due mainly to the cost-cutting measures. These measures reduced total production cost by 10-15%, allowing our exporters to pass on some of the gains as price reduction in the international market. This, in turn, stimulated external demand for our goods. In the transport and communications sector, cost-cutting measures and particularly higher productivity have also generated robust growth, demonstrating how important it is for a price-taker like Singapore to be internationally competitive. I will elaborate on this point later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half of the economy, which includes construction, trade and commerce, and financial and business services, has not done as well. The construction industry remains badly depressed due to the oversupply of properties. Growth in the trade and commerce sector remains weak, largely because of the slowdown in the regional economies caused by low commodity prices. As a result, recovery of the fiancial and business services sector has been modest, except for the offshore markets, which have done well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore cannot relax our efforts to restore the economy to steady growth. Our focus should be on the long term. We must aim for the targetted long-term growth rate of 4-6% per annum. Whether we succeed depends largely on the external environment, given the openness of our economy and our dependence on overseas mark everything to ensure that whatever happens, our chances of a sustained recovery are maximized. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>RESTORING INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS - WAGE RESTRAINT</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of restoring our international competitiveness cannot be over-emphasized. We are a price-taker in international markets. We can only sell our goods and services if our prices are right. The loss of our international competitiveness was a key reason for our recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1980 to 1984, wage increases in Singapore far outstripped productivity growth, while in the NICs, wage increases were either lower or at least matched by productivity increases. Our competitive position against the other NICs weakened by as much as 50%. Details are shown in the charts (Cols. 111 - 114) which are being distributed to Members. In this period, external demand for our goods and services grew by only 5% per annum, whereas that of the other NICs expanded by 11% per annum. In short, the other NICs expanded their share of the international market at our expense. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490111.htm\">charts - UNIT LABOUR COST OF SELECTED COUNTRIES, RELATIVE UNIT LABOUR COST AGAINST THE THREE NICs, 1980-1986 (Cols. 111 - 114)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, last year our priority was to restore our international competitiveness through cost reduction. The employer's CPF contribution rate was cut by 15 percentage points, resulting in a 12% saving in wage costs. Statutory charges were also reduced. In addition, unions and management reacted responsibly to the Government's call for severe wage restraint. CPF records show that wage restraint has worked. Under this policy, nominal wages increased on average by only 0.7% in 1986 (December 86 compared to December 85), compared to 5.4% in 1985 and 12.3% per annum between 1980-84. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, so far we have only managed to restore our competitive position to the 1982 level. We need to go one step further - to narrow our cost differentials with the NICs back to at least the 1981 level when our competitive position was relatively strong. This requires another year of low wage increases and high productivity growth. The wage restraint policy must therefore continue this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>(A) Wage Reform \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also adopt a long-term perspective in addressing the issue of international competitiveness. It is not enough just to restore our cost-competitiveness. We must also ensure that we maintain our competitive position, once it is restored. This will only happen if we reform our wage system. The NWC Subcommittee on Wage Reform has published its Report. It explains clearly the need for such reform. There must be flexibility in our wage system, to allow us to cope with the uncertainties of the economy, by adjusting through wages rather than through unemployment. This is in the interests of both companies and workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report provides guidelines on introducing a flexible wage system to the private sector. The public sector too formed a subcommittee to look into wage reform in the Civil Service. We must not miss this rare opportunity to reform our wage system, while memories of the recession are still fresh and the euphoria of recovery has not set in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies such as the Ministry of Labour and the National Productivity Board will offer every assistance to help companies introduce flexible wage systems. I am pleased to note that so far, 64 companies including both MNCs and local firms, and three industry groups have taken active steps to introduce a flexible wage system. I encourage others which have not done so to act quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>(B) Long-Term CPF Contribution Rate \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle the problem of high wage costs directly, the Economic Committee recommended that the Government immediately reduce employer CPF contribution rates to 10%, for two years in the first instance. This was done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also recommended that \"the Government should review the CPF scheme from a longer term perspective, to decide on the appropriate long-term rate and structure of contributions that would meet the basic needs of the CPF scheme\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> This is being done. Two different objectives have to be satisfied: we want to save as much as we can, in order to provide for the basic needs of retirement income, home ownership and Medisave; at the same time, the contribution rate must be one the economy can afford. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the long term target CPF rate cannot yet be determined, it is already clear that any increase in the CPF rate after these two years will have to be gradual. It will have to take into account the state of the economy and the conditions of the labour market. Any CPF rate increase must be implemented as part of an overall affordable increase in labour costs, so that our competitiveness will not again be affected. Investors can rest assured that the Government will not let our costs rise out of line again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>LONG-TERM TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal priority of the Government in the coming financial year will be to restore the economy to full health. At the same time, we must not lose sight of longer term issues, in particular, our place in the world economy. We are already implementing the longer-term recommendations of the Economic Committee to transform the economy. The Government, and particularly agencies such as EDB, TDB and MAS are pressing ahead along the New Directions. We plan to develop the economy in four main areas, viz. the upgrading of local businesses, and the promotion of investments, trade and services. \n  <br>\n  <br>(A) Upgrading of Local Businesses \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local businesses occupy an important role in our economy. We must build a solid base of thriving and resilient local businesses. In this connection, the Small Enterprise Bureau (SEB) has, since its inception, worked closely with SISIR, NPB and TDB to implement various programmes to help local businesses. These programmes improve access to capital by small firms, and encourage them to adopt modern management methods, to improve efficiency, to upgrade their technology, and to build up their product design capability. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response has been good, and more such programmes will be introduced. But the restructuring process will not be easy. Local businesses can be assured that the Government will give them every possible help to upgrade and modernise their operations to cope with the changing business environment. But Government help will not be enough. Our businessmen must have the will to adapt and adjust to changes, so that they can play their rightful role in the modern economy of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government remains committed to the view that the private sector should be the engine for economic development. To this end, Government has been gradually reducing its role in business. Guidelines for Government companies were first issued by my predecessor, Dr Tony Tan, in his 1985 Budget Speech, and I can do no better than repeat his statement: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Government will invest in new priority industries only where private entrepreneurs do not have the will or the money to undertake projects on their own or where it is essential for Government to provide the entrepreneurship; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Government will divest its shares in companies where it does not have a majority stake and where it is not essential for Government to have effective control; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) unlisted Government companies will, wherever possible, be listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) for critical companies which are considered to be vital to the national interest, Government will maintain a controlling interest but where possible will invite participation from the public through listing on the Stock Exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, Government has divested its interests in several companies and reduced its holdings in a number of others. In January 1986, a Public Sector Divestment Committee, comprising private sector representatives and Government officials, was set up to review and propose a programme for the privatisation of Government-owned enterprises. The Committee's role was to identify Government-owned enterprises suitable for privatisation and to recommend a privatisation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> programme which will provide the widest possible public participation and also ensure continuity of quality management. This Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Michael Fam, has completed its study and has presented its full report to Government. The report is being studied by the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>(B) Investment Promotion \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we do more to help local businesses upgrade and modernize, we must continue to attract more foreign investments to Singapore. We need foreign investments not only to generate and sustain economic growth but also to foster our economic restructuring and upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB's intensive marketing efforts and cost-cutting measures have paid off. Investment commitments as I mentioned earlier, reached $1.4 billion in 1986, 27% more than in 1985. But caution is necessary. Foreign investments will no longer come easily. The competition for the investor dollar is getting more intense and we are competing not only against developing countries but even against many developed countries. MNCs seeking investment locations are evaluating us against countries such as Britain, Spain and even some states in the US. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB's aggressive marketing and promotion efforts alone will not succeed in attracting foreign investments to Singapore. Our fundamentals must also be right. We must continue to have a stable and rational Government which has the support of the people; we must preserve good industrial relations climate; we must improve our efficient, comprehensive infrastructure. Finally, we need a highly conducive business environment which can offer a higher rate of return than the OECD countries. Otherwise, there is no incentive for the investor to come to Singapore. Therefore, every effort must be made to keep costs low and competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>(C) Trade Promotion \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB will continue its efforts to safeguard and expand our access to international \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> markets. We will continue to use all available avenues, such as international dialogues and forums, to argue for the maintenance of the system of free trade. But we must be prepared for more protectionist measures in the developed countries, the result of rising budget and trade deficits and rising unemployment. To safeguard our GSP entitlement, we will also have to resist premature attempts to graduate us to developed country status, which do not take into account limitations and the vulnerabilities of our small open economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from resisting attempts to deny us market access, TDB will step up its efforts to promote Singapore's exports, particularly of new products and to new markets such as Latin America, India and China. The Market Development Assistance Scheme has helped local companies to export their products and services. So far $4 million has already been granted to more than 400 companies. Major Original Equipment Manufacturers have been encouraged to set up International Purchasing Offices (IPOs) here. In the electronic sector alone, there were 22 IPOs in 1986 compared to only 12 in 1985. TDB will also help local companies improve their product designs and packaging capability, to make them more competitive in international markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Economic Committee's recommendations, TDB will upgrade and promote our entrepot trade and develop Singapore into a Hub City offering sophisticated services to support trading activities. Our warehousing and distribution facilities are being improved. More feeder lines will be encouraged to use Singapore as the pivotal cargo port of this region. In addition, the Pioneer Service Incentive will be used to encourage countertrading companies to set up their regional offices here. To date, six such companies have been awarded the incentive. These companies are expected collectively to generate $4 billion worth of business over the next three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>(D) Promotion of Services \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment promotion efforts no longer focus on manufacturing alone. This \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is important as our present niche as a manufacturing base is constantly being challenged by the other NICs. They have more resources and cheaper labour than we do. While we will not abandon manufacturing, we must move aggressively into services, particularly knowledge-based and skill-intensive services where we have a comparative edge and advantage. This is the way to develop into an international total business centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB has set up a Services Promotion Division to lead and coordinate efforts to promote services. The Government is extending tax incentives which were previously confined to manufacturing to a broader range of non-manufacturing activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Operational Headquarters (OHQs) incentive was introduced last year to attract international companies to Singapore, to manage and provide a full range of services to subsidiaries in the region. OHQs are desirable as they bring with them substantial and pervasive direct and indirect benefits to the economy. EDB is working out together with international accounting companies and bankers the types of OHQs we want to promote in Singapore. Four companies have already been awarded the OHQ incentive, and many more have expressed interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the pioneer incentive was extended from manufacturing to service industries. We hope that this will attract more knowledge- and skill-intensive services companies to Singapore. I will be announcing later a new incentive to promote offshore services, and encourage our companies to take advantage of overseas business opportunities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to actively promote development of banking and financial services. The Stock Exchange has been reorganised and revitalised. Development of the domestic capital markets is being augmented by the opening of a second exchange and by the launching of a new issue of marketable Government securities later this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in the offshore banking sector and in fee based financial services has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been encouraging, following the package of financial incentives introduced last year. With the opening up of Tokyo as a financial centre and the rapid internationalisation of banking, competition in financial services is expected to intensify rapidly. Government will ensure that Singapore remains competitive as a regional financial centre by continuing to upgrade its infrastructural facilities and to make available a sufficiency of skilled manpower. We will also ensure that the fiscal environment remains hospitable and I will have more to say on this subject later in my speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>FISCAL POLICY</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax cuts introduced in 1985 and 1986, at a cost of approximately $2.2 billion in lost revenue, together with other cost reduction measures and the wage restraint policy, have clearly worked to turn the economy around. However, it is not possible nor necessary to maintain some of the tax cuts indefinitely. The suspension of the tax on PUB bills, for example, and the concessions on property tax, will have to be reviewed when the economy has finally recovered. I can, however, give the assurance that tax concessions will remain in place for as long as necessary to maintain our international competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should caution, also, that further significant cuts in direct taxes cannot be expected without the compensatory introduction of some form of consumption taxation, as direct taxes are the main source of Government revenue, and structural deficits cannot be sustained in the long term. Naturally, we will look first to greater prudence in all areas of Government expenditure. In addition, we must ensure that Government programmes should be self-financing as far as possible, with minimal subsidies. In this connection, the level of subsidies appropriate for tertiary education has been reviewed, as announced by the Minister for Education this morning. \n  <br>\n  <br>Concluding Remarks \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1986 has been a watershed year in Singapore's economic history. For many Singaporeans, the recession was an awakening to economic realities. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lessons learnt from the recession were painful, but they were timely. We have to accept that the era of double-digit growth is over. The economy is in a more mature phase of development. Henceforth, growth will be more difficult to achieve. It will only be achieved if we successfully restructure our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, we must capitalise on our only asset - our people. Education and training must therefore continue to be the focus of our development strategy. They are long-term investments that will yield social and economic returns. The Government will continue to expand and improve our various educational and training institutions. The successful infusion of skilled and trained manpower into the economy will provide the impetus for us to grow and progress into the 1990s and beyond. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer term, we face the even more difficult problem of an ageing population, made worse by a rapidly declining fertility rate, particularly amongst the better educated. These trends, unless addressed now, and reversed, will inexorably lead to a Singapore lacking in the brainpower and vigour needed to compete internationally. Amongst other measures, I will be introducing, later in my speech, a package of tax measures designed to encourage procreation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SECTION II - THE FY87 BUDGET</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowdown in our GDP growth since 1984 and the tax cuts introduced in 1985 and 1986 have resulted in a substantial decline in tax revenue. The principal considerations in preparing the FY87 budget have therefore been to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ensure that recurrent expenditures are restrained so as to allow the recurrent budget to be balanced or to show a small surplus which could be used to fund development programmes which support economic recovery and longer-term economic growth \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- minimize the overall budget deficit so that Government reserves are not run down significantly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurrent expenditure increases for FY87 have been kept to the minimum necessary to maintain current levels of public services. Allocations for infrastructural development and capital assistance to the industrial and services sectors have, however, been stepped up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government spending in FY87 is estimated to be $18.67 billion, about $2.35 billion or 14% higher than the revised FY86 expenditure. Development outlays account for slightly more than half of total expenditure. As a proportion of GDP, Government expenditure is expected to rise from 43% to about 47%. This is largely due to a \"once-off\" increase in domestic debt servicing costs. Excluding debt servicing, the expenditure to GDP ratio will, in fact, drop slightly - from 40% to 39%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recurrent expenditure in FY87 is projected to reach $8.97 billion, about $2.58 billion or 41% higher than the revised FY86 level. Debt servicing costs account for $2.19 billion or nearly 85% of the increase. Excluding debt servicing, the estimated increase in recurrent expenditure would be about 7.7%, much lower than the average annual increase of 15% over the FY80-85 period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger part of the increase in debt servicing costs is due to a \"once-off\" payment of $1.45 billion in backdated interest on CPF advance deposits which are expected to be converted to domestic registered stocks in 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pension payments are expected to rise by $11 million or 6% because of higher ex-gratia payments to officers leaving the Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure of Ministries and Organs of State is projected to go up by $389 million or 7.7%. Expenditure by the Ministry of Defence is expected to be $94 million higher than in FY86. Expenditure by the other Ministries and Organs of State will increase by $295 million or 10%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $3.23 billion is set aside for the recurrent expenditure of the non-Defence Ministries and Organs of State. Of this, $1.68 billion or 52% is for Expenditure on Manpower, $0.59 billion or 18% for Other Operating Expenditure and $0.96 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> billion or 30% for Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on Manpower is projected to increase by $89 million or 5.6% - much lower than the average annual increase of 14% over the period FY80-85. The moderate increase is due to the wage restraint policy and a reduction of nearly 1,160 posts from the authorized staff establishment. The reductions are possible following deletions of long-standing unfilled vacancies, implementation of mechanisation, automation and computerization schemes, organisational reviews and changes in work procedures. The reductions are also in line with the objective, which I announced in my Budget Statement last year, of reducing the overall public sector manpower complement by 10% by the end of this decade. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual reduction of staffing levels and restraints on operating costs are part of an overall programme to improve productivity and enhance efficiency in the Civil Service. Members will recall that in my Budget Statement last year I announced the introduction of a programme of manpower scrutinies in the public sector. The scope of these scrutinies will in the coming year be widened to cover not only manpower requirements but also the running costs of activities. The scrutinies will involve a critical \"zero-base\" examination by Ministries and Statutory Boards of their major activities. Scrutinies will assess whether particular activities are necessary and, if so, whether they could be done at lower costs and with less manpower. Alternative means of achieving objectives including \"privatization\" of selected services and the contracting out of functions will be examined in the course of the scrutinies. The ultimate objective will be to ensure that public services are provided at least cost to the tax payer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Operating Expenditure of Ministries and Organs of State is projected to increase by $52 million or 10%. The larger part of the increase is due to provision being made for the Ministry of Health to contract out to the private sector the supply of pharmaceutical materials of hospitals consequent upon the decision to wind down an old Government phar- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> maceutical manufacturing facility and to farm out catering services at the Singapore General Hospital. Because of stringent control of operating costs, Other Operating Expenditure of the other Ministries and Organs of State is expected to increase by less than $22 million or 5%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase of $153.6 million or 19% is expected in expenditure on Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers. Of this, $50 million is for the creation of revolving funds for the provision of loans to NUS and NTI students to assist them in meeting the planned increases in student fees, details of which have been announced by Dr Tony Tan, the Minister for Education. Another $42 million is to finance the operating deficits of the tertiary and technical education institutions, aided schools and other Government-funded Statutory Boards. The HDB will be provided with a subsidy of $62 million to meet its operating deficit. This would be in addition to loan funds and capital subsidies totalling $6.26 billion provided under the development budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure for FY87, inclusive of capital grants and net lending to Statutory Boards and public enterprises, is estimated to be $9.70 billion, a drop of $237 million or 2% compared with the revised FY86 expenditure. The drop is mainly due to a substantial decrease in loans to HDB for its construction programme and for purchases of land required for public housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct development expenditure by Ministries and Organs of State is projected to be $1.55 billion or 75% higher than the revised FY86 estimate. The larger part of the increase is due to the provision of $1.26 billion for the purchase of Government land no longer required by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Jurong Town Corporation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $3.39 billion is budgeted for capital grants to Statutory Boards and other institutions. Almost a third of this is for the MRT system. A sum of $228 million is earmarked for the expansion of facilities at vocational, industrial training and tertiary educational institutions. Capital assistance by the EDB to industries and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> services sector will be stepped up substantially. Such assistance is expected to double to about $200 million. The provision for capital grants includes an allocation of $1.67 billion to finance the losses incurred by HDB on sales of flats and other capital-related expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total provision of $5.71 billion for loans, $4.6 billion or 81% is for the HDB and the balance is to meet the requirements of the EDB, Temasek Holdings and other public enterprises. Some $1.9 billion of the provision for loans to the HDB is for the purchase of state land required for public housing and the balance to finance construction activities. The EDB's industrial loan scheme is allocated a sum of $600 million, a very substantial rise over last year. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>SECTION III - REVENUE AND TAX CHANGES</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Budget, I said that we would monitor how Government charges would impact on our international competitiveness. I also assured Members that we would not burden the private sector with unnecessary statutory costs. To this end, we have cut taxes on public utilities and personal income taxes. The property tax rebate was deepened in July last year and various new tax concessions were introduced. These tax cuts have helped our companies regain their international competitiveness and have stimulated the economy. They are also consistent with our long term objective to move towards a lower corporate and income tax regime, in which enterprise and the factors of production are taxed as lightly as possible. But they have also reduced the Government revenue base, which will be further eroded when the corporate tax cuts come into effect this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch on the Government revenue position. With existing tax rates, the FY 87 tax revenue is estimated at $4.56 billion, $293 million less than in FY 86 and much lower than the $7.56 billion collected in FY 84. Consolidated Revenue for FY 87, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> however, is estimated at $9.06 billion, an increase of $1.27 billion over FY 86 and slightly lower than the figure of $9.81 billion for FY 84. However, the increase is almost entirely due to a transfer of $1.50 billion from the statutory boards to the Consolidated Fund. I will elaborate on this later. Excluding this amount, there will be a drop in the Consolidated Revenue receipts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account both expenditure and revenue estimates for FY 87, Government's overall financial position is expected to be in deficit by $3.75 billion. This deficit will be financed through domestic borrowings or a drawdown on reserves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimates show that tax revenue has declined sharply since 1985, and there is no room for further direct tax cuts without it being made up from other sources. The policy of this Government has always been to ensure that revenue is adequate to finance expenditure. This is important as structural deficits cannot be sustained in the long term. Greater prudency is therefore necessary in all areas of Government expenditure. The decision to trim manpower in the public sector by 10% by 1990 is one move in this direction. Equally important, we must ensure that all Government programmes be self-financing as far as possible, with minimal subsidies. This will not only keep Government expenditure low but it will also encourage more efficient use of resources and reduce waste. Furthermore, we will then avoid the problem faced in many countries, of insatiable demand for state produced goods and services that are heavily subsidized. Of course, Government will make sure that while those who can afford will pay for the services, the less fortunate and the destitute will be looked after. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Selective Goods and Services Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that last year, I said that the Government was seriously considering the introduction of a broad based consumption tax. I also indicated then that the machinery needed for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the collection of consumption taxes would have to be put in place. An early start is necessary to evaluate alternatives and to install the administrative machinery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad based consumption tax is a good compensatory source of revenue. However, I would like to reiterate that a broad based consumption tax will only be introduced if the revenue shortfall is substantial and a permanent deficit inevitable. The corporate tax rate at 33 per cent which comes into effect this year, is very competitive vis-a-vis the majority of the NICs and the OECD countries, and I do not envisage that we would need to reduce it further at the present time. This is because competitive tax cutting beyond a certain level, if practised by all countries, would ultimately be ineffective in achieving its aim. Also, whilst tax rates undoubtedly matter, competitiveness should, in general, be achieved by improving the pre-tax rate of return. That is to say, by reducing operating costs. The Government will take the necessary measures to ensure that such costs are kept low. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption taxes are not something new. A number of such taxes already exist. They include entertainment duties, duties on liquor and tobacco, tax on public utilities and telephone bills, etc. As a start, Government will consider extending the list of such consumption taxes on a selective basis to meet any future shortfall in revenue. A Consumption Tax Division will be set up under the Inland Revenue Department to look into the collection of such taxes. The Division will assist my Ministry in deciding on the items to be included in future under this selective basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Government has decided to adopt this item by item approach in preference to a comprehensive consumption tax at this point in time, the public must be prepared for such an eventuality when we are faced with a permanent budget deficit. In such a case a comprehensive consumption tax would be inevitable. In the final analysis, the need for a comprehensive consumption tax must be seen in the overall context of Singapore's economic imperatives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> TAXATION \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to tax matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>TAX ON COMPANIES \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Corporate Income Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier on in my speech, during the last year or so, Government has given a number of new concessions to ensure that we remain competitive. Time is needed for these measures to work. Therefore, I do not propose to introduce major changes to the corporate income tax, except to improve on the incentive package aimed at promoting Singapore as a financial and services centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Withholding Tax on Margin Deposits in Financial Futures and Loco-London Gold Trading</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in the 1984 Budget, tax concessions were granted to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and its members. SIMEX has grown and earned itself a rightful place in Singapore's financial scene. Within two and a half years of its formation, SIMEX has established itself as a formidable financial futures exchange in the Asia-Pacific time zone. The daily average volume recorded in the first two months of this year was well over 5,000 lots, an increase of at least 200% over the daily average volume of about 1,600 lots in 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at end February, SIMEX has a total of 30 Clearing members, 40 Non-Clearing members and 228 Individual members. Currently, SIMEX list 7 futures contracts. Plans are underway to list additional contracts including options based on the existing contracts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage the growth of gold and financial futures trading in Singapore and increase SIMEX members' international competitiveness, I am pleased to announce that with effect from Year of Assessment 1988, interest paid by SIMEX members on margin deposits for transactions in gold and financial futures shall be exempt from withholding tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, since Singapore is an important physical gold trading centre and has an active gold and deferred gold market, the latter being commonly known as Loco-London gold, I have decided to exempt interest paid by SIMEX members to non-residents in respect of transactions in Loco-London gold from withholding tax. This will make Singapore a more attractive place to carry out such transactions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extension of 10% ACU Tax to Securities Trading</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global trend in the financial market-place towards securitisation is likely to continue unabated. International securities trading, which has gained importance in major financial centres, will expand geographically and 24-hour trading in such international securities will soon be a reality. If Singapore is to continue to be a financial centre of consequence, we will have to tap into this activity and establish ourselves as a centre for the trading of international securities in the Asian time zone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to further accelerate the development of our capital market and fund management activities, I have decided that with effect from Year of Assessment 1988, the following income earned by the Asian Currency Units (ACUs) and securities companies approved by the MAS would be taxed at a concessionary rate of 10%: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) commission and fee income from transacting in non-Singapore dollar securities on behalf of non-residents (presently such income is already exempted for ACUs); and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) income derived from trading in non-Singapore dollar securities with non-residents, other ACUs and other approved securities firms. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Incentives for Promotion of Offshore Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of offshore activities has been identified as one of our key growth strategies. The slowdown in international merchandise trade as a result of protec- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tionistic pressures are likely to continue. Indications are that it will be counterbalanced by increased trade in services. World service trade has, in recent years, been growing twice as fast as merchandise trade and the trend is likely to continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage such offshore activities, I propose to extend the Export Incentive under the Economic Expansion Incentives Act, presently applicable only to manufacturing activities, to cover export of selected services. This will include, amongst others, consultancy, management, construction, technical and engineering services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive will be extended to qualifying services undertaken with respect to offshore projects. Under the Scheme, 90% of the qualifying export income would be exempt from tax. Provision will be made for an export base to be set where export income below the base would be subject to full corporate tax. The incentive will be for an initial period of five years but can be extended. The incentive will take effect from Year of Assessment 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>TAX ON INDIVIDUALS \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Personal Income Tax</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the new corporate tax rates, a new schedule of reduced personal tax rates was announced last year, to come into effect from Year of Assessment 1987. No further adjustments are envisaged at this time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CPF Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall the debate on 27 January 1987 on the Amendment of the CPF Act moved by the Labour Minister to provide for the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme. Some Members have suggested granting tax relief to children who use cash to top up the Minimum Sum Accounts of their parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that Government has decided to grant tax relief for such contributions with effect from 1st April 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount eligible for tax relief will be the difference between $30,000 and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parents' CPF balance before withdrawal at the age of 55 years. In the case of children topping up the Minimum Sum Accounts of both parents, the amount eligible for tax relief will be the difference between $45,000 and the parents' combined CPF balance before withdrawal at the age of 55 years. The relief will be subjected to a maximum of $6,000 per year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Second Reading on the amendment of the CPF Act, the Labour Minister has informed the House that the Minimum Sum Scheme will not be confined to CPF members only. As the scheme is also open to those who have no CPF Accounts, the tax relief will be similarly granted for cash contributions made towards the opening and topping-up of the Minimum Sum Account. This underscores the Government's efforts to encourage the self employed to provide for their old age needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Incentives to Encourage Procreation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the First Deputy Prime Minister has already made an announcement of the Government's population philosophy and what the supporting measures are. He has mentioned that Government will allow, amongst other things, the delivery and hospitalization expenses for the fourth order births to be offset against the parents' earned income when the new accouchement fee structure takes effect from 1 Jan 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more new births and to help reduce the burden of child-bearing and upbringing of the children, the following tax incentives will be granted with effect from Year of Assessment 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Normal Child Relief, the quantum of relief for the third child will be raised to $750 in line with the reliefs granted for the first and second child. This will be applicable to taxpayers who are presently claiming Normal Child Relief in respect of their third child as well as for taxpayers who would become eligible because of new births. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the eligibility for the Enhanced Child Relief will be lowered from 5 GCE '0' level passes to 3 GCE 'O' level passes or equivalent taken in one sitting. The Enhanced Child Relief will also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be extended to the new born fourth child. The amount of relief for this fourth qualifying child will be $750 plus 15% of the working woman's earned income subject to a maximum of $10,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also decided to introduce a Special Tax Rebate. A tax rebate of $20,000, which can be used to offset against either or both the husband's and wife's income tax liabilities, will be granted for the new born third child. An additional rebate equivalent to 15% of the wife's earned income, where the wife is working, will also be granted. However, this additional rebate can be offset only against the wife's income tax liabilities. The excess of both rebates will be allowed to be carried forward for a maximum of four years. In other words, the total rebate granted must be absorbed within a period of five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>OTHER TAX CHANGES \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duty on Bets</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present duty on bets is 20% on the amount of bets made on any totalisator or pari mutuel promoted by any racing club or association. It was last revised on 1st April 1984. While Government does not encourage gambling, it recognizes it as a practice which cannot be totally eradicated. What Government can do therefore is to ensure that the profits from gambling are not reaped by a few private individuals but channelled for the benefits of the society. I have therefore decided to increase the duty on bets to 25% with effect from 1st April 1987. The additional revenue yield is estimated at $43 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes and tobacco were last increased in March 1984 to discourage smoking. The increase had helped to retard the growth of smoking among the population. In 1985, the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco dropped by 4.3% compared to 1984, but the rate of decline had slowed down to only 1.6% in 1986. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Smoking Control Programme has got off to a good start in educating the public to stop smoking. In support of the effort to turn Singapore into \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a nation of non-smokers, I propose to raise both the import and excise duties on cigarettes and tobacco by $10 per kilogram - from the present $60 per kilogram to $70 per kilogram. With your permission, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to table Appendix 1 (Cols. 115 - 116) which sets out the changes. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490115.htm\">Appendix 1 - DUTIES ON CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO (Cols. 115 - 116)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in duties will take effect from today and the yield in revenue is estimated at $26.3 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Liquors</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on liquors, together with duties on cigarettes and tobacco, are traditionally a good source of revenue for Government. Revision in these duties is usually prompted as much by the need to raise revenue as by the need to achieve certain necessary and desirable social objectives. In the same manner as I have decided to increase the duties on cigarettes and tobacco, there will also be a general increase in the duties on liquors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from today, the import and excise duties on hard liquors in bottles will be increased by $60, - from $210 per decalitre to $270 per decalitre. The import and excise duties on beer and stout will be increased by $3 per decalitre. The import duty on cider and perry will be increased by $8 from $22 per decalitre to $30 per decalitre, while the import duty on sake will be increased by $25 from $130 per proof decalitre to $155 per proof decalitre, bringing it in line with the duty on samsoo. Duties on still wine will be standardized at $85 per decalitre irrespective of the proof strength, while duties on other liquors such as grape must and brandy, whisky, etc in other form will be standardized at $360 per proof decalitre. Details of the increases are set out in Appendix II (Cols. 117 - 122) which has also been tabled. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490117.htm\">Appendix II - DUTIES ON LIQUORS (Cols. 117 - 122)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue yield is estimated at $19.5 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Surpluses of Statutory Boards</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that the Public Accounts Committee had recommended in its 1985 Report that surplus funds of Statutory Boards in excess of their long-term development needs should be returned to Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance had since reviewed the financial position of the Statutory Boards. It has been decided that while the Statutory Boards would be allowed to retain the surplus funds to finance their future development needs, the accumulation of such funds well in excess of justifiable needs is to be discouraged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will be introduced in Parliament to authorize the Minister for Finance to require Statutory Boards to transfer their accumulated liquid reserves to the Consolidated Revenue Account. In FY 87, as I have said earlier, I propose to transfer $1.5 billion from the accumulated reserves of the Statutory Boards to the Consolidated Fund. In addition, with effect from Year of Assessment 1988, Statutory Boards will be required to pay into the Consolidated Fund an amount equivalent to what the Statutory Boards would have paid if their annual operating surpluses had been taxed at the corporate tax rate of 33%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax on Telephone Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1985, Government suspended the 20% tax on domestic telephone services and trunk call services to West Malaysia indefinitely. I have reviewed the position. The suspension will remain for the time being. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax on Public Utilities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% tax on electricity and gas was suspended for two years beginning from 1st November 1985 and would expire on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 31st October 1987. I have decided to extend the suspension until 31st March 1988, at which time the position will be reviewed again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Foreign Workers Policy and the Levy Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also reviewed the foreign workers policy. As recommended by the Economic Committee, the Government has decided to allow a controlled revolving pool of foreign workers on short term work permits to remain even beyond 1992. Recruitment of foreign workers will continue to be allowed in the manufacturing, hotel, construction and domestic service sectors, and they will form the revolving pool. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also decided to extend the Levy Scheme, instead of CPF, eventually to all work permit holders who are not Singapore permanent residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long term goal is still to reduce our dependence on foreign workers through economic restructuring. The foreign workforce will be controlled and the levy will be the main control mechanism for this purpose. Unskilled foreign workers from non-traditional sources will continue to be allowed only in the construction and shipyard industries and for domestic services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st April 1987, all new foreign workers who are not Singapore permanent residents will be placed on the Levy Scheme. Neither they nor their employers will have to contribute to CPF. However, existing Malaysian workers who are on the CPF Scheme will remain on this Scheme so long as they continue to work for their current employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change in the levy for the construction workers and foreign maids. The levy for foreign workers in all other sectors will be $140 per month. It will have to be raised if the demand for foreign workers becomes excessive as a result of either strong economic recovery or due to the conversion to the Levy Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work permit holders who acquire permanent residence will be placed on the CPF Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the past few years have been particularly turbulent for us. We have not been spared from the chill of recession. However, unlike a ship floundering in the high sea without a clear direction, we have taken swift actions to steer our economy out of the rough waters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are signs to show that the various fiscal measures taken by Government have yielded positive results. However, as I stated earlier, the recovery is not across the board. There are still hazards along the path to full recovery and they may throw us into disarray again if we are not vigilant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must not relent in our efforts to ensure a sustained recovery. The Government has made fundamental changes to its economic policies in general and fiscal policies in particular. It is necessary to give the economy time for the changes to be fully effective. I will regard this year, therefore, as a year of consolidation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the necessary conditions to enable us to overcome the current recession. Our infrastructure is first rate and our financial resources more than adequate. More important, we have a pragmatic and hardworking people and a healthy industrial environment. When faced with a crisis, the Government has not flinched from taking unpopular but necessary decisions to ensure the long term survival of the nation. Our people are willing to upgrade themselves and to adapt to changes. I am, therefore, confident that for as long as we continue to work together as a cohesive people, we will surmount the recession and be in a stronger and better position to see us through the 1990s and beyond. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

In the last few years, over 90% of the projects committed have resulted in actual investments. This generally takes place within 12 to 18 months. We would therefore expect that a high proportion, 75% to 80%, of the $490 million of Japanese investments committed in 1986 will actually come into Singapore this year and next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what steps the Government has taken or is taking to reduce the large trade deficit with Japan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is more meaningful to look at Singapore's trade balance with the rest of the world as a whole, rather than to try to achieve a balance with each individual trading partner. Part of the deficit in our trade balance with Japan in fact consists of goods which Singapore buys from Japan, but subsequently re-exports to other countries, just as many of our exports to Japan are in fact re-exported products which originated elsewhere. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan traditionally has not been an important market for Singapore. But it has been a crucial source of capital goods, industrial materials and foreign investments. Japanese investments in Singapore increase our exports to the rest of the world, which helps us to pay for the imports we need, including imports from Japan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government is always seeking ways to increase exports of domestic manufactured products to Japan. It is encouraging Japanese manufacturing companies located here to export more goods back to Japan, and Japanese retail stores here to promote our products in their outlets in Japan. As a result of Singapore government lobbying, SISIR has been granted the authority to inspect goods on behalf of MITI for use of the JIS mark. This should help local companies wanting to sell in the Japanese market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year because of the appreciation of the Yen and our greater export competitiveness, our domestic non-oil exports to Japan were 11% higher than the year before. If as a result of international pressure the Japanese economy becomes more open to foreign products, our exporters can expect to gain even more. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"30%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490103.htm\">Table - UNSOLD HDB FLATS AS AT 31 JANUARY 87 (Cols. 103 - 104)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490105.htm\">answer - LITTERING, SPITTING AND ILLEGAL DUMPING (Cols. 105 - 106)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490107.htm\">Annex - 1986 RECURRENT EXPENDITURE AND ENROLMENT (Cols. 107 - 108)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490109.htm\">Annex II - NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE AND NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE TUITION FEES AND LOANS FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 1987/88 (Cols. 109 - 110)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490111.htm\">charts - UNIT LABOUR COST OF SELECTED COUNTRIES, RELATIVE UNIT LABOUR COST AGAINST THE THREE NICs, 1980-1986 (Cols. 111 - 114)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490115.htm\">Appendix 1 - DUTIES ON CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO (Cols. 115 - 116)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870304/19870304-HA-0490117.htm\">Appendix II - DUTIES ON LIQUORS (Cols. 117 - 122)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
