E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before we resume I would like to\r\n\r\nclear a point under the Standing Orders which  was\r\n\r\nraised  yesterday  by  the Honourable  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and commented upon by myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item under discussion was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sub-head 1, new item - Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\n(Establishment), Grade C ($1,950)... $23,400.00\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>under  Head  8,  Chief Secretary.  The  Honourable\r\n\r\nMember  stated  that the reason  why  he  had  not\r\n\r\ntabled  any amendment to this item was because  it\r\n\r\nwould have required the Governor's consent, and it\r\n\r\nwas  doubtful if the Governor would allow  Members\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition to interfere with the terms and\r\n\r\nconditions of service of serving officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commented that there was nothing to prevent an\r\n\r\nhonourable Member from giving notice of  a  motion\r\n\r\nto  reduce  any  item in any head of  expenditure,\r\n\r\nthat  he might be faced with having to obtain  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's recommendation or consent, but  that  I\r\n\r\ndid  not think that he was entitled to assume that\r\n\r\nhe  would not get the recommendation or consent of\r\n\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to look into the\r\n\r\nmatter  a  little more closely and I am  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat, in this particular case, it was incorrect to\r\n\r\npresuppose that it was in fact necessary that  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  recommendation or consent  would  have\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  signified. The  relevant  portion  of\r\n\r\nparagraph (1) (b) of Standing Order 33 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except with the recommendation or consent of the\r\n\r\nGovernor signified thereto, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly  shall  not  proceed  upon  any  bill  or\r\n\r\nmotion,  which, in the opinion of the  Speaker  or\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General, would effect any alteration\r\n\r\nin the salary, allowances or conditions of service\r\n\r\n(including leave, passages and promotion)  of  any\r\n\r\npublic officer...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the provision under the relevant\r\n\r\nitem  is  for  a  new post of Permanent  Secretary\r\n\r\n(Establishment) and no public officer has  as  yet\r\n\r\nbeen   appointed  to  that  post.  In   my   view,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  no  public  officer  is  affected  and\r\n\r\nconsequently  the Standing Order  would  not  have\r\n\r\napplied. It follows that the Honourable Member  in\r\n\r\nfact   would  not  have  required  the  Governor's\r\n\r\nconsent  had  he given notice of an  amendment  to\r\n\r\nreduce the sum allotted to that particular item. I\r\n\r\nthought  it  was wise that I should  correct  that\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (9th January,\r\n\r\n1957) proposed on Head 26 of the Schedule,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $10,000 for Head 26 stand part\r\n\r\nof the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $10,000 for Head 26 stand part\r\n\r\nof the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.05 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,\r\n\r\nMr  Chairman, Sir, in objecting to the  grant  of\r\n\r\nthis  sum to the Royal Singapore Flying Club,  the\r\n\r\nlearned  Member for Tanjong Pagar  gibed  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  training pilots for bombing the Suez  Canal.\r\n\r\nSir, much as we may loathe the colonial breed,  it\r\n\r\nwould be wrong and churlish not to recognise  that\r\n\r\nit  was these young men who not so long ago  stood\r\n\r\nbetween humanity and Hitler; that it was they  who\r\n\r\nchanged  the  destiny of the  learned  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar from that of a nihongo  functionary\r\n\r\nto that of a Kuo-yu patriot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Singapore Flying Club, Sir, supplied\r\n\r\n30 pilots in actual combat in Singapore during our\r\n\r\nwar  with Japan. I received this information  last\r\n\r\nnight  from  a man who was a member of that  group\r\n\r\nand  who  himself is a domiciled Malayan  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  one useful purpose has been served by  this\r\n\r\nobjection. The learned Member for Tanjong Pagar is\r\n\r\nright  in  complaining that the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of this club are Europeans. That  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  fault of the Europeans who see an opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  healthy and interesting activities  and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of it. It is the fault of our own  youth\r\n\r\nand  it  is my hope that this debate will  receive\r\n\r\nsufficient  publicity in the Press in  order  that\r\n\r\nour  youth  should  be aware of the  opportunities\r\n\r\nwhich  the  club  offers and that they  will  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of them. I, for one, Sir, fully  support\r\n\r\nthis subsidy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.06 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  fully endorse the comments  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar yesterday regarding  this\r\n\r\ngrant  of  $10,000  to the Royal Singapore  Flying\r\n\r\nClub. I cannot understand how this grant has  been\r\n\r\nrecommended.  Could  it  be  that  it   has   been\r\n\r\nrecommended on the ground that the word \"Royal\" is\r\n\r\nthere? \"Royal\", Sir, is a very big word!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Down with it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Down with the word \"Royal\"! I\r\n\r\nam told that only 30 per cent of the members learn\r\n\r\nto fly. And out of this 30 per cent, a number will\r\n\r\ngradually leave because they have failed, just  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill said that he  tried  to\r\n\r\nlearn  how to fly and he failed and now he  is  no\r\n\r\nmore  interested in flying. The other 70 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  members do not learn how to  fly  because\r\n\r\nthey  are not interested in flying. What they  are\r\n\r\ninterested in is to get drinks in the early  hours\r\n\r\nof the morning!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Members say no, let me tell them, Sir, that\r\n\r\nI  have been there on one or two occasions. I was\r\n\r\nintroduced by members of that club -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> It is not a shame, it is an\r\n\r\nexperience. If I had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  been  there, I would not have known that  the\r\n\r\nclub do supply drinks up to the early hours of the\r\n\r\nmorning. Sir, I was asked by my friend who  was  a\r\n\r\nmember that if I wanted to get drinks even in  the\r\n\r\nearly  hours  of the morning, or if  I  wanted  to\r\n\r\nentertain  my friends right up to the early  hours\r\n\r\nof the morning, I should join the club. I was told\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no other bar or club in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  provided this amenity. The only alternative,\r\n\r\nif  you want to get a drink in the early hours  of\r\n\r\nthe  morning, is to join the club. So since 70 per\r\n\r\ncent of the members join this club for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  drinking only, why not change the name of  the\r\n\r\nclub  to  the \"Royal Singapore Drinking Club\",  as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar put it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Many\r\n\r\nflying  enthusiasts have refused to volunteer  for\r\n\r\nservice with these two organisations because  they\r\n\r\nare  subject  to  discipline.  To  join  a  Force,\r\n\r\ndiscipline is necessary, but to join the Singapore\r\n\r\nFlying  Club it is considered that one must  be  a\r\n\r\npersonage before one can join. That is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  many  people  have refused to  volunteer  for\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said that the Club teaches people to fly. If he is thinking of merdeka, then by all\r\n\r\nmeans  let us fly to merdeka rather than  walk  to\r\n\r\nmerdeka!  I  oppose this grant of $10,000  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Flying Club and I wonder whether  it  is\r\n\r\nin  order for me, Sir, to move to delete this  sum\r\n\r\nfrom the vote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That is true, Sir, because  I  have  been\r\n\r\nflying very often and I have asked the pilots, who\r\n\r\nrefuse  to drink, especially on the day when  they\r\n\r\nare on duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a suggestion to make which will, I\r\n\r\nthink,  meet  the  objections of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  and the Member for Queenstown - that\r\n\r\nwhilst approving this grant of $10,000, we make it\r\n\r\na  condition that this flying club should  not  be\r\n\r\nmisused by those who are not interested in  flying\r\n\r\nbut  in drinking. This is actually a condition  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  in their own interests.

They are as concerned as he is\r\n\r\nover  the need for pilots, and they then presented\r\n\r\nhim with a memorandum which set out the figures of\r\n\r\nthe pilots available - European and local - for flying\r\n\r\ncivilian airplanes: they also put forward a scheme\r\n\r\nto   the   Minister  suggesting  how  the  present\r\n\r\nunfortunate  state of affairs could be  corrected.\r\n\r\nIn this scheme they suggested:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) To undertake the training scheme, the\r\n\r\nfollowing  training staff and equipment  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A professional flying instructor on full-time duty to train in the air and organise\r\n\r\nlectures  on  theory  for  commercial  pilot\r\n\r\nlicences, instrument rating syllabi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A professional engineering instructor on\r\n\r\nfull-time duty to give basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naircraft   engineering   lessons   and    to\r\n\r\norganise  training to both Singapore  flying\r\n\r\nclubs and commercial operators' workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) One twin-engined aircraft fully equipped\r\n\r\nwith  instruments,  radio communication  and\r\n\r\nnavigational  sets  to  enable  twin-engined\r\n\r\ninstrument rating to be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Certain equipment for both pilot and\r\n\r\nengineer  lectures  most  of  which  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained or made in Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister received this memorandum and he will remember that he had present a man called Mr\r\n\r\nWarcup  who did not think very much of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Cairnhill claims that, this being a\r\n\r\ndemocratic   country,  everybody  can   join   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Flying Club, notwithstanding its  royal\r\n\r\nprefix.  Let  me remind him how much it  costs  to\r\n\r\nqualify,  not  including  the  entrance  fees  and\r\n\r\nsubscription fees, the cost of keeping the  social\r\n\r\nhabits  of  the  other members in  the  club.  But\r\n\r\nassuming one abjures all these, how much would  it\r\n\r\ncost  to get an \"A\" Licence? Regulations lay  down\r\n\r\nthat  there must be a minimum of 40 hours'  flying\r\n\r\nexperience  before one can obtain an \"A\"  Licence.\r\n\r\nThe  club's fees are $24 per flying hour. Assuming\r\n\r\nthat  one graduates in the minimum time (40 hours)\r\n\r\nand  does  not meet with a misfortune - as  did  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill who never graduated - it  costs\r\n\r\n$960   per   licence   minimum,   without   paying\r\n\r\nsubscription  fees, entrance fee, without  joining\r\n\r\nin  all the drinking orgies. $10,000 on that scale\r\n\r\nwould  produce ten pilots a year. If this vote  is\r\n\r\npassed  and this Government is still in  existence\r\n\r\nnext year, we will want to know whether there will\r\n\r\nbe  ten  new  local pilots by next year - not  white\r\n\r\npilots - because  it is local money that  is  paying\r\n\r\nfor  all  this,  although it is a nominated  white\r\n\r\nMinister who is recommending it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a small matter really- $10,000.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, last month we agreed to give away  $23\r\n\r\nmillion.  It seems to be straining at  a  gnat  to\r\n\r\nargue  about this $10,000. But it is a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  is  at stake.  [Laughter.]  There\r\n\r\nbeing  all  kinds - it is not a laughing matter.

I\r\n\r\nthink  I  had  better  go  quietly  and  seriously\r\n\r\nthrough  a few of the facts and perhaps afterwards\r\n\r\nif  there is time and the House will bear with me,\r\n\r\nI  will deal with a few of the fantasies which are\r\n\r\nfloating  around in the rather ill-informed  minds\r\n\r\nof the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I had better start by pointing out that\r\n\r\nthe  $10,000 grant proposal is, of course,  linked\r\n\r\nwith  another item which stands next to it in  the\r\n\r\npaper  before  us, i.e., for the purchase  of  the\r\n\r\nflying club's properties, and these two items  are\r\n\r\nlinked  together with the object of  enabling  the\r\n\r\nClub to pay off its debts and to equip itself with\r\n\r\nnew aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I might mention that we have\r\n\r\nbeen  seeking from the Government of  India  under\r\n\r\nthe Colombo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan the provision of an H.T.2 trainer made by the\r\n\r\nHindustan Aircraft Company and although  I  cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  have got it yet, I am very  hopeful\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall get it; and it would be  very  odd\r\n\r\nindeed  if  the  Government  of  India  was   more\r\n\r\ngenerous  to  our local flying club  than  is  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Tanjong   Pagar,   supported   with\r\n\r\nenthusiasm by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better deal with one point which\r\n\r\nwas   raised  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nyesterday,  and  that is, the calculation  of  the\r\n\r\ngrant  to  the  Club.  I have here  the  estimated\r\n\r\nbudget for the Flying Club for 1957 on which  this\r\n\r\ngrant  is  finally based, after the  Treasury  had\r\n\r\nvery  rigorously and closely examined the finances\r\n\r\nof the Club, not only now but throughout the whole\r\n\r\nof its post-war history. Under \"Direct maintenance\r\n\r\ncosts - licensed  engineer, labour force,  Provident\r\n\r\nFund,  insurance, electricity and  so  on - $63,580:\r\n\r\nRadio     maintenance - $4,800:    Direct     flying\r\n\r\ncosts - $23,232\",  giving a grand total  of  $91,612\r\n\r\nexpenditure anticipated during 1957. Against  that\r\n\r\nyou  have estimated income from private owners  of\r\n\r\n$4,000 for hangar space: let to other requirements\r\n\r\n$5,000:  profit  on  the club-house  $5,000:  paid\r\n\r\ntrips in commercial flying $12,000: club flying at\r\n\r\nabout  140  to  150 hours per month, estimated  at\r\n\r\n$50,400.  You  will see. Sir, that  that  gives  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $76,400  and  an  expected  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$15,212.  The  proposed grant will not,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmeet  the estimated deficit, but we hope that with\r\n\r\nthe  provision of new and better aircraft the Club\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to increase the number  of  people\r\n\r\nusing  its  planes, using its capacity  much  more\r\n\r\nfully, and that in fact the income figures will be\r\n\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a great point has been made by Members of\r\n\r\nhow one has heard of people drinking very late and\r\n\r\nnot of oneself drinking very late, I think I might\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  $5,000 profit on the  club-house\r\n\r\namounts to about 6\u00bd per cent of the gross income\r\n\r\nexpected  in  1957,  and I should  think  this  is\r\n\r\nprobably one of the smallest club-house profits of\r\n\r\nany  club in Singapore.

Members will  turn\r\n\r\nto their Estimates they will find on page 292 under\r\n\r\nthe     Head     \"Civil    Aviation\",     Singapore\r\n\r\nHeadquarters - Other Charges Annually  Recurrent - sub-head  5, the figure of $2,500 in respect of renewal\r\n\r\nof  instruments ratings and flying  for  radio  and\r\n\r\ntesting;  and further under \"Singapore Airport\"  at\r\n\r\npage  296,  under  O.C.A.R. again,  the  figure  of\r\n\r\n$1,500  for  \"Aircraft Charter  for  Inspection  of\r\n\r\nRunway  and Approach Lighting\", giving you a  total\r\n\r\nof  $4,000  allocated for chartering  aircraft  in\r\n\r\norder  to  calibrate radar and instruments  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  inspections  of lighting  and  that  kind  of\r\n\r\nthing.  When  we  get further equipment  coming  in\r\n\r\nshortly,  there  will be a need  to  fly  over  and\r\n\r\naround  the  beacon on St. John's Island  and  that\r\n\r\nkind of thing in order that they can be tested  not\r\n\r\nmerely  by  commercial  aircraft  flying  on  their\r\n\r\ncorrect   routes,  but  on  the  possibility   that\r\n\r\nsomebody would fly off the correct routes,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the coverage is overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure of $4,000 required for aircraft\r\n\r\ncharter  is based on the assumption that the  Royal\r\n\r\nSingapore   Flying  Club  will  be  available   for\r\n\r\nchartering its planes at a cost of $50  to  $60  an\r\n\r\nhour.  If the Club is denied this grant and has  to\r\n\r\nclose down, as it would, then it will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  charter planes from  the  commercial\r\n\r\nairlines. The cost would be between seven  and  ten\r\n\r\ntimes as great, depending on what type of plane you\r\n\r\nare  able to get and the time at which you want it;\r\n\r\nand  consequently, instead of a figure  of  $4,000,\r\n\r\nyou  will  get  a  figure of  between  $30,000  and\r\n\r\n$40,000, at least $20,000 more on the public budget\r\n\r\nthan  is available and is charged on the budget  by\r\n\r\nthis  grant. So that quite apart from the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  the bar is a popular part of the  Club,  I\r\n\r\nhope that the charter services will be popular with\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and will not force us to  come  back\r\n\r\nfor  an  A.S.V. for another $25,000 or  $30,000  in\r\n\r\norder to charter aircraft to maintain the safety of\r\n\r\nthe  airport. If hon. Members would scrutinise  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  with more care and ask useful questions,\r\n\r\nthey would learn these things and would not have to\r\n\r\nbe  taught them when they misrepresented the  facts\r\n\r\nto  the public and show that they do not, in  fact,\r\n\r\nknow what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the club's estimated budget and the\r\n\r\nfact  that we are not meeting its deficit.  Let  me\r\n\r\nturn  to  the  information we sought  about  flying\r\n\r\nclubs  in  other  countries. There  are  subsidised\r\n\r\nflying   club   systems  in  a  number   of   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries - in  Pakistan, Indonesia and India - and  we\r\n\r\nhave particularly attended to the very full details\r\n\r\nwhich  we  were given by courtesy of the  Director-General  of Civil Aviation in New Delhi.  In  India\r\n\r\nclubs  are placed in four classes- I, II,  III  and\r\n\r\nIV.  A Class I club is one which is expected to fly\r\n\r\n3,500  hours in the course of a year;  a  Class  II\r\n\r\nclub 2,500 hours: a Class III club 1,500 hours, and\r\n\r\na  Class IV club 1,000 hours. A Class I club has  a\r\n\r\ndirect subsidy grant of 100,000 rupees; for a Class\r\n\r\nII  club  75,000  rupees; a Class III  club  60,000\r\n\r\nrupees;  a  Class  IV 40,000 rupees.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nClass   I   and   II  clubs  get  40   rupees   per\r\n\r\ninstructional  hour grant related directly  to  the\r\n\r\nactual  instruction given; Class III and  IV  clubs\r\n\r\nget 50 rupees per instructional hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in India clubs get free hangars, one-third of their aeroplanes free, free landing, free\r\n\r\nV.H.F. radio equipment, both air and ground, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  also  have generous free scholarship  flying\r\n\r\nschemes. Sir, if we compare all that with what  we\r\n\r\nare proposing for the Royal Singapore Flying Club,\r\n\r\nwe  will find that the estimate of $50,000 revenue\r\n\r\nfrom flying is based on the expectation of 140  to\r\n\r\n150  flying  hours  per month, or  somewhere  over\r\n\r\n1,500  to 1,900 flying hours per year, which  puts\r\n\r\nthem  in  the  Class III category  of  the  Indian\r\n\r\nscale.  Therefore, if it were an  Indian  club  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  eligible for a grant of  about  $40,000\r\n\r\n(converted  from  rupees)  plus  about   $30   per\r\n\r\ninstructional  hour, and of course it  would  also\r\n\r\nget   all   the  other  free  hangars  and   other\r\n\r\nfacilities which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They are teaching Indians how\r\n\r\nto fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The hon.

I myself am a white man and  he  is\r\n\r\nunable  to forgive me for that unhappy element  in\r\n\r\nmy  background in spite of the fact  that  I  have\r\n\r\nspent  more  than half my life here, that  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  domiciled in this country and that I have  a\r\n\r\nMalayan wife, and that I am heart and soul and for\r\n\r\nmuch longer than himself a worker on the political\r\n\r\nscene  on  behalf of the labour movement  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  But leaving that aside, I may point  out\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said  yesterday and what he  conveniently\r\n\r\nignored, that the Royal Singapore Flying  Club  is\r\n\r\nprogressively malayanising itself, and that of the\r\n\r\nstudent pilots under instruction - he did not listen\r\n\r\nto  this yesterday and now laughs at it - more  than\r\n\r\n40  per  cent  are  in  fact now  Asian.  He  also\r\n\r\nasserted,   and  it  is  quoted   again   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers - I  think  twice  over  in  the  English\r\n\r\npapers  (this is the Singapore Standard, which  is\r\n\r\nall  I  have  with me here)- \"so far not  a  single\r\n\r\nqualified pilot from Malaya has been offered a job\r\n\r\nin  any  of the airlines. This alone is sufficient\r\n\r\nto  indicate the nature of the times.\"  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether  the Straits Times did  not  publish\r\n\r\nthis  inaccuracy. In any case,  the  fact  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is that four of the Malayan Airways pilots\r\n\r\nwere  trained in the Royal Singapore Flying  Club.\r\n\r\nThe  hon.

I do not suppose that\r\n\r\nhe  would  rise to apologise because it  would  be\r\n\r\nconfessing that he had been wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the membership of the Flying\r\n\r\nClub, I happen to have here the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfigures  year  by year, the names and  details  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  were  taking student pilot  and  other\r\n\r\nlicences. As I look down the first page  alone,  I\r\n\r\nsee Chinese, British, Australian, Chinese, Indian,\r\n\r\nChinese,   Indian,  Canadian,  British,   Chinese,\r\n\r\nBritish,  Filipino,  American, Eurasian,  British,\r\n\r\nIndian,   Malay,   Eurasian,   Chinese,   British,\r\n\r\nChinese,  British.  Further on  I  find  Arab  and\r\n\r\nCeylonese  and others. This is the answer  to  the\r\n\r\nallegation that this is a white man's club seeking\r\n\r\nto  drain  the lifeblood of the people  and  spend\r\n\r\nmoney on drinking. It is a club in which there  is\r\n\r\na   happy  all-races  membership  happily  working\r\n\r\ntogether  as fellow club members. His  attempt  to\r\n\r\nmake racial bars where they do not exist seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  abominably mischievous in the circumstances of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are on this question of drink, I might\r\n\r\nmention once again this further point, that if you\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of people drinking in the club and  if\r\n\r\ntheir profits are used for subsidising flying,  it\r\n\r\nhas  pretty much the same effect as when we put  a\r\n\r\ntax  on drinks and cigarettes in order to increase\r\n\r\nthe   revenue  of  the  colony.  When  people  are\r\n\r\ndrinking,  they  are  actually  assisting  in  the\r\n\r\nflying  needs  of the club, but the  club  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily disqualified for a grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar referred to the\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways Local Employees Union's memorandum\r\n\r\nabout  the  training scheme. He did not quote  the\r\n\r\ncost which would be incurred if you were going  to\r\n\r\nemploy   full-time  instructors  in   flying   and\r\n\r\nengineering  and  a full-time aircraft  and  other\r\n\r\ncosts. We did not go into that in great detail. We\r\n\r\nhave  looked  at  the scheme and it  was  obvious,\r\n\r\nhowever, that a grant of $10,000 would by no means\r\n\r\nbe   enough  to  pay  for  a  full-time  qualified\r\n\r\ninstructor  and  to  provide  an  aircraft  to  be\r\n\r\navailable  for  training. We have, in  fact,  been\r\n\r\nworking and are still working on schemes which,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  will  in  due  course produce  considerable\r\n\r\nexpansion  of training facilities. It may  not  be\r\n\r\nwise  or  necessary  to  set  up  a  costly  local\r\n\r\norganisation if we can get the training facilities\r\n\r\nwe need in friendly neighbouring countries such as\r\n\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I have taken rather longer over this than I would have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwished,  because I felt that it was  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nsome  importance  to deal with these  ill-informed\r\n\r\nstatements made by the hon. Members. Perhaps I can\r\n\r\nconclude by making the three points which  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  made. I will summarise them.  First,  the\r\n\r\nFlying   Club   does  provide  specific   training\r\n\r\nfacilities which have been used and which we  hope\r\n\r\nwill  be used more extensively in the future,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  a very valuable factor. Second, it  also\r\n\r\nprovides charter facilities which do bring genuine\r\n\r\nrevenue into the Civil Aviation Department and  do\r\n\r\nhelp  to  reduce  the  taxes quite  significantly.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  it  does  provide  a  stimulus  to  air-mindedness  which is of very great  importance  in\r\n\r\nthis  mid-20th  century time  when  all  technical\r\n\r\ntraining  is  of  the  greatest  importance,   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  training depends partly on interest  in\r\n\r\ntechnique.  If  I  may,  I  will  just  read,  Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  from the opening paragraph of  the  New\r\n\r\nDelhi notes to which I referred just now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The flying club movement in India has been in\r\n\r\nexistence  for  a  very long time.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  civil  aviation  in   India   has\r\n\r\nproceeded  side  by side with the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nflying clubs. The very first flying club in  India\r\n\r\ndated  back to 1928. More flying clubs have  grown\r\n\r\nup  since. The total number now active is  twelve.\r\n\r\nThey  are  centred in various big cities all  over\r\n\r\nIndia. They provide flying facilities for students\r\n\r\nfrom  various universities and also cater for  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the general public in respect of  sports\r\n\r\nand  hobby  flying. They have all along helped  to\r\n\r\npromote  air-mindedness and have  created,  so  to\r\n\r\nsay, a pool of people interested in flying out  of\r\n\r\nwhich  have  emerged young men who  have  selected\r\n\r\nflying  for  a  profession. Being fully  aware  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the Government of India have accepted  that\r\n\r\nthe   flying   clubs  must  be  given  substantial\r\n\r\nfinancial aid. The operation of aircraft  being  a\r\n\r\ncostly  affair, the flying clubs are not on  their\r\n\r\nown  able to meet the expenditure involved in  the\r\n\r\nrunning of the clubs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the policy of our great neighbour and\r\n\r\nfriend, India, and I must say that I think it is a\r\n\r\nvery much more realistic and competent policy than\r\n\r\nthe  policies  enunciated by the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  who  have objected  to  this  proposed\r\n\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10,000 for Head 26 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 31-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $14,100 for Head 31 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 43-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $53,600 for Head 43 stand part\r\n\r\nof the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.

And if this  club  gets  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties   because  the  Minister's   drinking\r\n\r\ncompanions have not been frequenting the  bar,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be asked to take over the building  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Gun Club, on the grounds that it  trains\r\n\r\nmarksmanship  and we want more rifle  shooters  in\r\n\r\nthis colony. Sir, we could argue on that basis  ad\r\n\r\ninfinitum. It is quite a different thing  to  come\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly  to cite India  to  prove  that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Indian Government has a flying  club\r\n\r\nscheme, and since our Royal Singapore Flying  Club\r\n\r\nis  analogous to the Indian flying club  movement,\r\n\r\ntherefore we ought to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was talking to an expatriate yesterday\r\n\r\nand he told me that there was only one other place\r\n\r\nin  the  world, to his knowledge, where one  could\r\n\r\nenjoy  pleasure flying more cheaply, and that  was\r\n\r\nEgypt. But when Colonel Nasser came in, he  put  a\r\n\r\nstop to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told, Sir, that although the number of\r\n\r\npupils  seeking instruction is 40 per  cent  local\r\n\r\npeople  as  against 60 per cent  expatriates,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people who make use of flying facilities\r\n\r\ndoes not correspond to that ratio at all. The bulk\r\n\r\nof  the expenditure is incurred in the maintenance\r\n\r\nof  the  aircraft, and that is a facility  enjoyed\r\n\r\nalmost altogether by the expatriates. Let us  face\r\n\r\nfacts.  These  expatriates are not  Malayans,  and\r\n\r\nnever  will be, although they often write  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, \"We Malayans so and so...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the actual sum involved- $56,700 - we would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know what is the market value  of  these\r\n\r\nbuildings, what was the cost originally,  and  how\r\n\r\nmuch has been allowed for depreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.48 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is now clear\r\n\r\nwhom the hon.

The buildings, I think,  cannot  be\r\n\r\neasily  valued  precisely because  they  were,  in\r\n\r\nfact, built very largely by the labour of the club\r\n\r\nmembers themselves and with the loyal co-operation\r\n\r\nof  the bar-boys who worked side by side with  the\r\n\r\nmembers  in carrying the bricks and spreading  the\r\n\r\nconcrete and that kind of thing. There is a spirit\r\n\r\nof  comradeship in that club which  is  singularly\r\n\r\nlacking in the Member for Tanjong Pagar. But I  am\r\n\r\nadvised  that  the cost of the transfer  from  the\r\n\r\nKallang  club-house which they had to give  up  to\r\n\r\nthe reconstructed club-house at Paya Lebar was  in\r\n\r\nthe  nature of $72,000. That is the only figure  I\r\n\r\nhave  got. It would probably vary considerably  if\r\n\r\nwe  went into the detailed costing of it all,  but\r\n\r\nthat  is a recognisable figure to take. The  gross\r\n\r\nvaluation  for  the club-house was $39,000  but  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount had to be deducted from that,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the cost of making certain repairs.  The\r\n\r\nvalue  of the hangar was $33,600. Again deductions\r\n\r\nwere  made  for the cost of replacing one  of  the\r\n\r\nwalls  and  various other minor improvements  were\r\n\r\neffected   if  it  were  to  become  a  government\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The figures are, I think, adequate  for\r\n\r\nthe Member's needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R.

I pointed out that  the\r\n\r\nprofits  to  be expected were $5,000 or  6\u00bd  per\r\n\r\ncent of the total estimated revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  1957.  That  was one mention which  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  failed  to  notice.  I  referred  to   the\r\n\r\ndrinking  habits of the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nand  the  Member for Queenstown who  made  remarks\r\n\r\nabout  it. I indicated that if, in fact,  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  members  did  help to  support  the  club  by\r\n\r\nlifting  their elbows, well that, of  course,  was\r\n\r\ncommon practice in almost every club in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  in fact, the practice of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole to derive revenue from taxes on liquors  and\r\n\r\ncigarettes and similar consumption in order to pay\r\n\r\nfor  necessities. The fact that the club does what\r\n\r\nthe Government does is not a very bad thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I might take this opportunity of saying\r\n\r\nthis,  Mr  Chairman, Sir. We have, I think,  very\r\n\r\nfully  argued  the  reasons  why  this  grant   to\r\n\r\npurchase  buildings  is  necessary.  If  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember is not convinced, then he will no doubt  be\r\n\r\nfully convinced if we can stop the grant. He  will\r\n\r\nno  doubt  fully  support my  application  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse for a very large A.S.V. to meet the cost of\r\n\r\nchartering  aeroplanes and that alone might  serve\r\n\r\nto  convince  him  that he ought to  support  this\r\n\r\npurchase and this grant. I hope that if this House\r\n\r\nhas again to consider possibly increased subsidies\r\n\r\nrather nearer to the Indian rates, Members will by\r\n\r\nthat  time study the facts more carefully and will\r\n\r\nbe ready to give favourable consideration. This is\r\n\r\nthe  minimum subsidy which can possibly  keep  the\r\n\r\nclub  going as a useful part of the civil aviation\r\n\r\nstructure in Singapore. It is possible that it may\r\n\r\nbe  too  low  and that we ought to  have  made  it\r\n\r\nbigger.  That will take, of course, experience  to\r\n\r\nfind out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.53 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Since the Minister is so\r\n\r\nanxious  to give the impression that this club  is\r\n\r\nintended  for  a  serious  purpose,  we  ought  to\r\n\r\nacquaint  ourselves with the facts. The memorandum\r\n\r\nthat  was  presented to him in February last  year\r\n\r\npointed  out the acute shortage of Malayan pilots.\r\n\r\nIf  we  intend  to run our internal  airlines,  we\r\n\r\nshould have a big scheme, not this feeble idea  of\r\n\r\nsupporting  a  flying  club  meant  primarily  for\r\n\r\nrecreational purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pilot position in civil airlines is as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Airways - 39 expatriates; 12 Asians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federation Air Service - 3 expatriates; 1 Asian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabba Airways Limited (Borneo) 5 expatriates;\r\n\r\nno Asian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International operators are left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total comes to: 47 expatriates and 13\r\n\r\nAsians.  There  is  no  Asian  who  is  flying  an\r\n\r\naircraft as a captain. No local aeroplane can  fly\r\n\r\nover  Malaya without a white man on board. Let  us\r\n\r\nface  facts. We are fighting colonialism  and  the\r\n\r\nwhite man stands for colonialism. So we fight him.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  settle that fight, we will settle  other\r\n\r\nfights amongst ourselves. But first we settle  who\r\n\r\nis  to  be  master  in  this country.  I  make  no\r\n\r\napologies  for being anti-colonialist.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nquibble  and  say, \"Oh, I am against the  colonial\r\n\r\nsystem,  but  I am really a friend of the  British\r\n\r\nand  I  love the British.\" I do not. I am  against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and as long as the British  represent\r\n\r\ncolonialism   in  this  country,  I  fight   them,\r\n\r\nunrelentingly, as they fight me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It offends my sense of propriety to have every\r\n\r\nlocal  aeroplane piloted by a European. I  support\r\n\r\nthe  union when the union said, \"If you are really\r\n\r\nserious about training pilots, then have a serious\r\n\r\nscheme.\"  I  have  already  pointed  out  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister that $10,000 could, if used for no  other\r\n\r\npurpose  than just pay for the training of pilots,\r\n\r\nproduce ten pilots a year with an \"A\" Licence.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  he had not costed the scheme which the union\r\n\r\nput forward to him, but it was something much more\r\n\r\nthan  $10,000.  And  so it would  be.  If  we  are\r\n\r\nserious  about  it and not just  toying  with  the\r\n\r\nidea,  let us set about it in a serious  way.  The\r\n\r\nunion  put forward these suggestions - I am  reading\r\n\r\nfrom their memorandum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Providing for reasonable expansion of aviation\r\n\r\nand for the replacement of expatriates, there is a\r\n\r\nrequirement  of some 60 pilots for the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears   (60   fully  qualified  pilots)   to   fly\r\n\r\ncommercial aeroplanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making allowance for trainee wastage, it would\r\n\r\nbe necessary to have an intake of 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npilots  each  year to begin with, which  could  be\r\n\r\ndecreased   or   increased   in   the   light   of\r\n\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now told that we are going to give\r\n\r\n$57,000  to  take  over some buildings.  From  the\r\n\r\ndescription of the way in which the buildings were\r\n\r\nput  up,  they must be very unsound,  if  bar-boys\r\n\r\nwere used to carry bricks and stick them up with a\r\n\r\nbit of mortar! No wonder nobody is able to give  a\r\n\r\ncorrect  estimate of the value of these buildings!\r\n\r\nBut  we  are asked to subscribe the sum of $56,700\r\n\r\nfor  these  buildings. We have not been told  what\r\n\r\nthey  really are worth. The Minister says he  does\r\n\r\nnot  know what they are worth. Obviously  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  matter. All he wants to do is to get the club\r\n\r\nout of a jam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these buildings going to be used for?\r\n\r\nAre  they  really necessary? Is $56,700 worth  the\r\n\r\nprice  we are paying for what we want to make  use\r\n\r\nof these buildings for? We come back to this basic\r\n\r\nobjection.  We  are  not here  to  give  financial\r\n\r\nsupport to European recreational activity in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  We object to it even more when they  try\r\n\r\nto  camouflage  it behind some beneficial  results\r\n\r\nfor the local population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian flying clubs, Sir, are teetotal. That\r\n\r\nperhaps is the reason why my friend the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok   Ayer  kept  on  insisting  about  drinking\r\n\r\nhabits. They have a serious purpose. They may have\r\n\r\ngrown  out  of the old colonial flying clubs  they\r\n\r\nhad  in India when Europeans amused themselves  by\r\n\r\nflying.  But  the  Indian  flying  clubs  are  now\r\n\r\nengaged in the serious pursuit of trying to  build\r\n\r\nup  as  large  a  field of  men  who  can  fly  as\r\n\r\npossible.  But the flying clubs are not the  basis\r\n\r\nof  India's Air Force, or India's growing force of\r\n\r\nflyers.  They  have  properly  organised  training\r\n\r\ncourses. And further - there is no need to laugh  at\r\n\r\nthis - even  Ceylon  has  an Air  Academy  to  train\r\n\r\npeople  how to fly, in a serious way, and  not  to\r\n\r\nthrow away public funds on a European - whatever  is\r\n\r\nthe  colour  of  the flying club  secretary - flying\r\n\r\nclub  in which we are sinking $57,000 and to which\r\n\r\nwe  are  giving  a grant of $10,000  a  year.

A  most  helpful\r\n\r\ncontribution from the Member for Tanjong Pagar was\r\n\r\nthat we should give a further grant of $10,000  to\r\n\r\nthe  Flying  Club so that they could take  on  ten\r\n\r\nMalayans, give them 40 hours' training each  at  a\r\n\r\ncost  of $960 each and they would then be able  to\r\n\r\ngo  ahead  and produce ten more pilots  among  the\r\n\r\nwastage  of  people not getting  through  and  who\r\n\r\nshould get through somehow. Sir, I will give  very\r\n\r\nserious consideration to that possibility and I do\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  fact  that he  recognises  that  the\r\n\r\nFlying  Club could perform a most valuable service\r\n\r\nif  we cannot get the service performed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI  cannot go into the scheme since we are  working\r\n\r\non  it  at  the  moment because it involves  other\r\n\r\ngovernments and it must be brought to a final form\r\n\r\nbefore  I can make statements about it. There  is,\r\n\r\nof  course, always the possibility that it may not\r\n\r\ncome  to a successful final form, and in that case\r\n\r\nit  is  certainly very reassuring to know that  we\r\n\r\ncan  count  on the support of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty   for  at  least  another  $10,000  to   pay\r\n\r\nspecifically for ten pilots to be trained  by  the\r\n\r\nFlying  Club,  and  I  do  welcome  this  generous\r\n\r\ngesture  on  his part which I think  is  the  most\r\n\r\nfruitful contribution made to the debate so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that I did not give any figures of the\r\n\r\ncost  of the buildings. I would remind him that  I\r\n\r\ngave him the cost of the transfer - $72,000 - and  the\r\n\r\nestimated valuation was $39,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further complained that he did not know what\r\n\r\nuse  was  going to be made of the buildings  which\r\n\r\nare going to be used by the Royal Singapore Flying\r\n\r\nClub.  In  the  event  the Singapore  Flying  Club\r\n\r\nceased to exist, the buildings would be taken over\r\n\r\nfor government use. There are a number of uses  to\r\n\r\nwhich  they could be put in the Paya Lebar Airport\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich space would be required ultimately and could\r\n\r\nbe  used right now.

Present plans, Sir, provide a rate of\r\n\r\nconstruction of up to about 5,500 housing units  a\r\n\r\nyear  by 1960. As hon.

The  key  to\r\n\r\nthe  problem is the re-development of these  areas\r\n\r\nand   it   is  the  intention  to  set   aside   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  proportion  of  current  and  future\r\n\r\nhousing  programmes for the rehousing  of  persons\r\n\r\ndisplaced from such slum areas. Thus, Sir, a large\r\n\r\nproportion  of Programme No. 8 will be devoted  to\r\n\r\nthe   rehousing  of  families  of  this  category;\r\n\r\napproximately  1,400  housing  units   are   being\r\n\r\nreserved  for this purpose. The remainder  of  the\r\n\r\nhousing  units, amounting to 4,215 units, will  be\r\n\r\nused  mainly  for  accommodating families  of  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group who are now  on  the  Housing\r\n\r\nRegister,  but some of these houses will  also  be\r\n\r\nrequired to rehouse families from sites which will\r\n\r\nhave to be cleared for public development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, now to give you the breakdown\r\n\r\nfigures  of  Programme No. 8. 2,923 housing  units\r\n\r\nand  92  shops  are being constructed  at  Kallang\r\n\r\nAirport.  339  housing units and 59 shops  in  the\r\n\r\nShort Street/Rochore Road/Albert Street area.  128\r\n\r\nhousing units and 14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshops  in  Upper  Hokkien Street, Upper  Pickering\r\n\r\nStreet  and  South Bridge Road area. 192  housing\r\n\r\nunits  and 6 shops at the old filter beds at Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah.  200 housing units at Bukit Panjang.  1,800\r\n\r\nhousing  units and 64 shops at St. Michael's  Road\r\n\r\nradio station area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from this, improvement to Trust\r\n\r\nhouses is also being made at Balestier Estate.

Members will note, Sir, that  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest  proposed for this loan is 5\u00bc per  cent\r\n\r\nper  annum.  This approximates to the  present-day\r\n\r\nmarket  rate and is in accordance with the  policy\r\n\r\nof the Government as set out in the White Paper on\r\n\r\nhousing subsidies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one question which I know\r\n\r\neverybody  will be asking, and that  is,  at  what\r\n\r\nrents will these houses be let? Sir, I am not in a\r\n\r\nposition today to give full details of the rentals\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  proposed to charge. These  will  be\r\n\r\npresented to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  House when the motion for the approval of the\r\n\r\nsubsidy which will be necessary is introduced. But\r\n\r\nI  can say now, Sir, that the aim of Government is\r\n\r\nto  build standard 2-roomed flats which can be let\r\n\r\nat  a  standard inclusive rent of $30 per  mensem.\r\n\r\nThere   are   families  both  on   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust housing register and in the slum\r\n\r\nareas  which  will  have to be  cleared  who  will\r\n\r\nrequire  and  who can afford to pay  for  somewhat\r\n\r\nmore  spacious accommodation. The needs  of  these\r\n\r\nfamilies, Sir, will be met by the construction  of\r\n\r\n3-roomed  flats  for  which  the  rent   will   be\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the region of $40 per mensum. But the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  which the Government has in mind will  be\r\n\r\nweighted in favour of the standard 2-roomed flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the House will be given the\r\n\r\nopportunity of going into the question  of  rental\r\n\r\npolicy in greater detail at a subsequent sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have given sufficient details of\r\n\r\nthe  programme which is to be carried out from the\r\n\r\nloan for which I seek this Assembly's approval.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  again, Sir, that it is the firm  intention\r\n\r\nof   this  Government  to  devote  itself  to  the\r\n\r\nsolution  of the housing problem with a  sense  of\r\n\r\nurgency and to press on with determination towards\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate  goal of healthy and decent  housing\r\n\r\nfor  all  the people of Singapore.

However, the motion in itself does not  give\r\n\r\nany  indication  as  to  a reduction  in  rentals.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the subsidy policy, Sir,  the  only\r\n\r\nbenefit  that  existing tenants will  get  is  the\r\n\r\nwaiver  of  the service, lighting and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges.  Apart from that, there is no benefit  at\r\n\r\nall.  Where is the reduction in rentals? I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee  it at all. According to a Press report in the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Standard a few days  ago,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  Government  intends  to  reduce\r\n\r\nrentals below $60 but those above $60 will not  be\r\n\r\nbenefited.  I do not know where is the  source  of\r\n\r\nthis report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The usual source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> According to this report,\r\n\r\nthere  is  discrimination, as the  subsidy  (after\r\n\r\nthis  loan  is  granted) will be for 2-room  flats\r\n\r\nonly. Houses with three or four rooms will not  be\r\n\r\nsubsidised  by Government. I wonder  whether  this\r\n\r\nreport  is  correct. If it is, I  cannot  see  why\r\n\r\nthere  should be discrimination between  a  2-room\r\n\r\nflat and a 3-room flat. If it is the contention of\r\n\r\nthat  report in the Singapore Standard and of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself that those who  live  in  houses\r\n\r\nwith  three or four rooms are rich people, then  I\r\n\r\nthink  their contention is entirely wrong.  It  is\r\n\r\nnonsense.  People are not happy to live in  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses.  They  are forced to because  they  cannot\r\n\r\nfind  accommodation elsewhere. They are forced  to\r\n\r\npay whatever rentals are charged. The only benefit\r\n\r\nthey  derive from living in S.I.T. houses is  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not have to pay \"tea money\". If they were\r\n\r\nto try and get a private dwelling, they would have\r\n\r\nto  pay some form of \"tea money\". In the case  of\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. houses, the high rentals charged could\r\n\r\nbe  said  to be some form of \"tea money\", but  the\r\n\r\npublic  have  no alternative but to  accept  their\r\n\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by the Minister, when moving this\r\n\r\nmotion, that the new houses to be built out of the\r\n\r\nloan  money  will be subsidised by the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  rentals charged for them will be  tabled\r\n\r\nbefore  this Assembly after they have been  worked\r\n\r\nover.  The Minister has not been able to  give  an\r\n\r\nindication as to the rentals to be charged, but he\r\n\r\nsays  it  may be around $30 to $40. What  I  feel,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  that  the rentals will be based  on  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  the initial capital plus  maintenance\r\n\r\nplus  interest  and any other charges,  especially\r\n\r\nthe   administrative  charges  incurred   by   the\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers in the S.I.T. They  have  very\r\n\r\nfat salaries and that adds to the high cost of the\r\n\r\nrentals.  Why  then, Sir, in  this  motion  it  is\r\n\r\nstated the loan will be repayable over a period of\r\n\r\n60  years.  Why  not increase the  loan  repayment\r\n\r\nperiod  further? In this way, the rentals  charged\r\n\r\nwill  be  less. The reason is that if you work  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of the initial capital plus interest and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  charges and the fat salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers and stretch all that out  over\r\n\r\na  period of, say, 80 years, instead of 60  years,\r\n\r\nthe   rentals  will  be  cheaper.  The   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  or the Minister himself may  come  back\r\n\r\nwith  the  argument that the rentals charged  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  based  exactly  on  the  factors  I  have\r\n\r\nenumerated.  Although the actual  figure  will  be\r\n\r\nbased  on  this, the difference will be subsidised\r\n\r\nby Government. If this is true, Sir, then I should\r\n\r\nsay that it is going to be a very heavy burden for\r\n\r\nthe Government to bear. If, worked on the basis of\r\n\r\na  60-year period, the rental comes to $60, and if\r\n\r\nthe  Government  feels  that  an  economic  rental\r\n\r\nshould  be $30, then the Government will  have  to\r\n\r\nbear  the extra $30 in the form of a subsidy.  But\r\n\r\nif that figure is spread over 80 years, the actual\r\n\r\ncost  may  come to only about $45,  and  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  need only to subsidise  $15  stretched\r\n\r\nover a longer period. The actual gross figure will\r\n\r\nbe  recovered. There is no difference at all.  The\r\n\r\ndifference is that repayment will be over 80 years\r\n\r\ninstead of 60 years. If the Government intends  to\r\n\r\nlimit  it  to 60 years, then the subsidy  will  be\r\n\r\nhigher,  and when the Budget comes up before  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain  show  a  very big deficit.  To  cover  this\r\n\r\ndeficit,  taxes  will  be  raised.  But   if   the\r\n\r\nrepayment  is  spread  over  80  years,  then  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  will  be lower. Then the  Budget  deficit\r\n\r\nwill  be  smaller. Maybe there might be a surplus,\r\n\r\nand  in  that  event there will be no increase  in\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told, Sir, by some quarters that the\r\n\r\nworking  of  this 60-year period is based  on  the\r\n\r\nlife  of  a building. May I draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  the  Financial Secretary  and  the\r\n\r\nofficials  of the S.I.T. that there are  buildings\r\n\r\nwhich  are about 40 years old and are still strong\r\n\r\nand  they are not built of brick? They are  wooden\r\n\r\nstructures built before the first world war  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  basis. If these wooden  structures  can\r\n\r\nlast  for  40  years and more, I  cannot  see  any\r\n\r\nreason why structures built with brick cannot last\r\n\r\n80  years. I will refer the Minister to a block of\r\n\r\nwooden houses along Rangoon Road. They were  built\r\n\r\nbefore  the first world war and today they are  as\r\n\r\nstrong as any other building. If a notice to  quit\r\n\r\nwere given to the tenants of these buildings, I am\r\n\r\nsure they would rather prefer to remain there than\r\n\r\nbe  moved out into permanent structures. Why then,\r\n\r\nSir,  suggest  that  the life  of  a  building  as\r\n\r\nenvisaged  by the Minister will last for  only  60\r\n\r\nyears  when a temporary wooden structure can  last\r\n\r\nfor 40 years and more? I certainly believe that if\r\n\r\nthe  Improvement Trust were to give their building\r\n\r\ncontracts to a reliable contractor and he were  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the  Trust  houses according  to  plan  and\r\n\r\nspecifications, such houses would last far  longer\r\n\r\nthan  60  years. According to the existing  houses\r\n\r\nbuilt by the contractor for the Trust, Sir, I  can\r\n\r\ndefinitely say that they are not worth a  cent  at\r\n\r\nall. The house in which I am now staying was built\r\n\r\nabout   four   years  ago  and  it   is   cracking\r\n\r\neverywhere. I have had to complain to the Trust on\r\n\r\nmany occasions about leakage. I think that is  the\r\n\r\nfault  of  either the Trust or its  contractor.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is the responsibility of the Trust  and\r\n\r\nthe  contractor  to see that such  structures  are\r\n\r\nproperly  built rather than work on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nlimiting their life to 60 years. I think  that  is\r\n\r\nthe fault - to limit the life of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  to 60 years.

Again, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave come across occasions where the Trust housing\r\n\r\ninspector has taken a lot of trouble to look,  not\r\n\r\ninto  the  condition of the houses, but  into  the\r\n\r\nbedrooms  and  the  beds, and under  the  beds.

Let  us\r\n\r\ntake  an  example: the capital sum of  $1  million\r\n\r\nborrowed  at 5 per cent and lent to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust at 5 per cent to be  repaid  on\r\n\r\nthe  annuity system over a period of 60 years. The\r\n\r\nannuity  then would be $52,828. If the  period  of\r\n\r\nrepayment  were extended to 80 years, the  annuity\r\n\r\nrepayment  per  annum would be $51,030.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  saving will be $1,798. If you  spread\r\n\r\nthat  over the hundred odd houses which  might  be\r\n\r\nbuilt from the $1 million, the effect in the rents\r\n\r\nwould not be very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore.

My  understanding  is  that\r\n\r\nunits  of  2 bedrooms and a sitting-room would  be\r\n\r\nround  about $4,000 each. It had been round  about\r\n\r\n$4,000  up to last year. A unit consisting of  two\r\n\r\nrooms,  that is, one sitting-room and one bedroom,\r\n\r\nshould  not cost more than $3,000 at the  outside.\r\n\r\nWe  are told that the major programme would be  in\r\n\r\nthe construction of very low-cost units for which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  rental  of  $30 per unit would  be  charged.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore think that most of these houses intended\r\n\r\nto  be  built with this $44,737,000 would be round\r\n\r\nthe  $3,000 to $4,000 figure. How is it then  that\r\n\r\nthe  average should appear to be $8,000 per  unit?\r\n\r\nWe  must  make allowances because the  shop-houses\r\n\r\nwill  cost well over $10,000 or even $15,000 each.\r\n\r\nWe  are assured that the majority of them will  be\r\n\r\nlow-cost houses but some houses are going to  cost\r\n\r\nat  least  $20,000 per unit which will  bring  the\r\n\r\naverage  up to $8,000 per unit. That, Sir,  to  my\r\n\r\nmind, is a departure from the intention of housing\r\n\r\nthe poor people or the people who cannot afford to\r\n\r\nlook  after themselves in this country and I would\r\n\r\ndeprecate  any increase for any unit costing  more\r\n\r\nthan $5,000 a unit. With this $44,737,000 we shall\r\n\r\nget  units of houses costing $8,000 to $10,000 per\r\n\r\nunit and not about $5,000 for each unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to bring up is the\r\n\r\nrentals  charged. I have never been able  to  come\r\n\r\ndown to figures or to understand how the flats  in\r\n\r\nElizabeth  Estate,  I am told, cost  about  $8,000\r\n\r\neach  and the rent comes to about $60 a month  for\r\n\r\neach  flat.  I  know for a fact  that  people  who\r\n\r\npurchase   their   own  houses  through   building\r\n\r\nsocieties and who have to pay 7 per cent  interest\r\n\r\non  the money borrowed, if they are able to obtain\r\n\r\n100  per  cent mortgage on an $8,000  house,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  paying  $80 per month  for  capital  and\r\n\r\ninterest  for 13 years, after which period,  those\r\n\r\nhouses  will belong to them. Therefore,  this  $80\r\n\r\nper month for an $8,000 house includes payment  of\r\n\r\ncapital  by instalments as well as interest  at  7\r\n\r\nper  cent.  On those houses charged  $60  a  month\r\n\r\nrental,  I  think  that  the  Government  is  only\r\n\r\ngetting a return of three per cent interest and  I\r\n\r\nfind  it  very  difficult to  understand  how  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust  can  justify  $60  a\r\n\r\nmonth  rentals  for so long as  the  houses  last.\r\n\r\nAccording   to  calculations  based  on   building\r\n\r\nsocieties, the capital for those houses should  be\r\n\r\nrecovered  in  about  20 or  25  years.  There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore, in my mind, room for a reduction in the\r\n\r\nrents of those houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis motion would not have been necessary if there\r\n\r\nwere  many houses in Singapore and everybody  were\r\n\r\ncomfortably housed but because of the shortage  of\r\n\r\nhousing  and the high rentals charged, we are  now\r\n\r\ntrying  to  find  ways and means  of  helping  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I put it to you, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  housing shortage in Singapore will ease,  not\r\n\r\nonly  when the Singapore Improvement Trust starts\r\n\r\nbuilding  more  houses,  but  also  when   private\r\n\r\nbuilders  accelerate their rate of  building.  For\r\n\r\nprivate builders, however, they cannot hold on  to\r\n\r\ntheir houses all the time and rent them out and so\r\n\r\nwe  must have a class of people who are willing to\r\n\r\ncome forward to buy such houses. We have many such\r\n\r\npeople coming forward to buy these houses.  A  few\r\n\r\nof  them  buy them outright, but many  others  buy\r\n\r\nthem  after  receiving  loans,  either  from   the\r\n\r\nColonial  Development Corporation, or  from  other\r\n\r\nbuilding   societies.   These   people   must   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  not only to buy houses but  to  retain\r\n\r\nthem  and  by  so  doing set an example  to  other\r\n\r\npeople to buy and own houses of their own. We  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to spread the good things of life  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. We always talk about wanting\r\n\r\nto  help  the  poor people and I  think  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  do not buy luxurious houses  outright\r\n\r\nbut just ordinary houses to live in cannot, in any\r\n\r\nway, be classified as rich people. If they do  not\r\n\r\nlike such houses, then they will have to depend on\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust to  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my calculation, Sir, for 5,500\r\n\r\nhouses  costing $44,737,000, each house will  cost\r\n\r\nabout  $8,000.  Now, on an average, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust expects to get rentals  in  the\r\n\r\nregion   of   $30  per  month.  In  many   housing\r\n\r\nestates - and  I  will point out one, the  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden  Estate - houses  are  put  up  for  sale  at\r\n\r\n$11,000 each but from that $11,000 the builder has\r\n\r\nalready  had  his  cut, and for a  2-room  terrace\r\n\r\nhouse,  the  cost as calculated should  be  around\r\n\r\n$8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Phew! That is about 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, I think that that is\r\n\r\nabout  the amount of money that they make in  that\r\n\r\nhousing  estate.  Let us put  the  cost  at  about\r\n\r\n$1,000   or  $2,000  higher,  yet  the  basis   of\r\n\r\nassessment which the Government is levying on them\r\n\r\nis  not  $30 or $40 a month but in the  region  of\r\n\r\nbetween $80 and $100. That, Sir, I maintain is not\r\n\r\nthe way to encourage these people to own their own\r\n\r\nhouses  and that is why I believe it will make  it\r\n\r\nmore  necessary for the Government to come to this\r\n\r\nAssembly again and again to ask for more money  to\r\n\r\nbe  loaned  out  for  Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nbuildings. I maintain, Sir, that if we  are  going\r\n\r\nto  help the people of Singapore, then we must not\r\n\r\njust  help only those who are lucky enough to come\r\n\r\nand  live in Trust houses, but also those who have\r\n\r\nthe courage to try and own their own houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite Government to look into this matter of\r\n\r\nassessment  on private houses again  and  to  levy\r\n\r\nsuch  assessments as to encourage these people  to\r\n\r\nown their own houses. The necessity for coming  to\r\n\r\nthis  House  to ask for more loans to  build  more\r\n\r\nbuildings will then be less frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, this motion is\r\n\r\nvery  significant and very wise. This also sets  a\r\n\r\nnew phase in the housing history of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  Sir,  the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nwhich is the housing authority has been confronted\r\n\r\nwith many difficulties. The most important one has\r\n\r\nbeen the cost of building. Some Members have dealt\r\n\r\nwith the cost of housing in detail but from my own\r\n\r\nexperience,   as   a  member  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, I have found that the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  has to face  competition  from\r\n\r\nprivate  builders. Things have not  been  so  very\r\n\r\neasy  for the Singapore Improvement Trust and they\r\n\r\nare  so  even now. I understand, Sir, that in  the\r\n\r\npast  two  or  three months, the cost of  building\r\n\r\nmaterials  has  risen 10 per  cent  more  than  in\r\n\r\nprevious  months. This goes on to prove  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust  will not be able to build houses at cheaper\r\n\r\nprices  now  than they were built before.  I  have\r\n\r\nalso  reviewed the question of tenders  that  were\r\n\r\nput  up by the Singapore Improvement Trust and  it\r\n\r\nwas  evident, from all these things, that the most\r\n\r\nimportant  factor in building - it has always  been\r\n\r\nand it will be for some time more, I believe, from\r\n\r\nwhat I have been told by some experts - is the cost.\r\n\r\nI think, Sir, that because of this fact, the rents\r\n\r\nalso  had  to be increased. We are all aware  that\r\n\r\nsince  the  Government took office,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nlooking  into  this  matter  very  seriously   and\r\n\r\nearnestly.  In  the past, they declared  that  the\r\n\r\ninterest on loans would be 2\u00bd per cent and  this\r\n\r\nhad  no  effect  on  the people who  were  renting\r\n\r\nhouses.  We worked it out and found that a  tenant\r\n\r\ncould only get a reduction of $2 to $3 if we  were\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the  interest to 2\u00bd  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has now taken a bold and decisive  step\r\n\r\nin  subsidising public housing which will directly\r\n\r\naffect  the tenants who are badly in need of  help\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government. This motion, in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the subsidy policy of the Government, should\r\n\r\nenable the poorest man in Singapore to be happy in\r\n\r\na  very decent home. It has been declared, Sir, in\r\n\r\nthis  White Paper, that the service charges  will,\r\n\r\nin future, be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, this motion has also tackled in\r\n\r\nthe  right  way  the slum clearance  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Much criticism has been levelled in the\r\n\r\npast  at Government's inactivity although  it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  inactive  about  slum  clearance.  This\r\n\r\nKallang   project,  Sir,  will  enable  the   most\r\n\r\ncongested  area of the town to be  replaced  by  a\r\n\r\ndecent housing estate and the existing barren land\r\n\r\nat  St.  Michael's Road will be filled with decent\r\n\r\nhouses  and  occupied by our people. I feel,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  this first step towards slum clearance  will\r\n\r\nbe  continued  with all vigour by Government  and,\r\n\r\nwithin  a few years' time, we will all be able  to\r\n\r\nsee  a very decent Singapore with no slums at all.\r\n\r\nI  am hopeful, Sir, because, from my experience. I\r\n\r\nhave  found that the Government has at no time  in\r\n\r\nthe past been so sincere and honest in tackling  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which is a great social need in Singapore\r\n\r\nthan it is doing today. It is from the need for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses that discontentment and frustration arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Member of this Assembly has spoken about\r\n\r\nthe period for the loan. He tried to amend the 60-year  period to an 80-year period some  time  ago,\r\n\r\nwith  little  support from Members.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  from  experience  that  a  sound  financial\r\n\r\npolicy  and  loan  policy do not  allow  the  loan\r\n\r\nperiod  to be so extended as to have no comparison\r\n\r\nwith  the  approximate life  of  the  building.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, that it is a universal  practice\r\n\r\nfor  all permanent housing loans not to exceed  60\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel sure that the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nfrom  now on, can hope to obtain houses for  which\r\n\r\nthey  pay rents which they can afford. Sir, I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister for Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and Housing for introducing this  bold  and\r\n\r\ndecisive policy on housing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.46 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I listened with interest on the subject of\r\n\r\nhousing  and  the housing policy of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust. I find here that the  interest\r\n\r\nrate  charged  is 5\u00bc per cent. In the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil,  my  hon. Friend the Chief Minister,  who\r\n\r\nwas  then  a member of the Labour Party,  and  the\r\n\r\nHon. the   Assistant  Minister  to   the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary, also a member of the Labour Party - if  I\r\n\r\nremember  correctly - generally opposed the interest\r\n\r\nof  2\u00bd  or 3\u00bd per cent given. Their contention\r\n\r\nhad  been that the Government should give all  the\r\n\r\nmoney  free  of interest as a subsidy.  Now,  from\r\n\r\nthis  3\u00bd per cent, the Government is seeking  to\r\n\r\ncharge  us 5\u00bc per cent. I cannot understand  why\r\n\r\nthere  is such a wide change and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow on what basis the Government is charging 5\u00bc\r\n\r\nper cent for a period of 60 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the postwar period, we have seen\r\n\r\nfluctuating  changes  in the  money  market.  Even\r\n\r\nduring   the   postwar  period,  if   I   remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly, the Government and the Municipality had\r\n\r\nloans  at  3, 3\u00bc, 3\u00bd and even 4 per cent,  but\r\n\r\n5\u00bc  per cent is incredibly high. If it  was  for\r\n\r\nsix  months  or  a year, that would  have  been  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter altogether. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharging  this continuously for 60 years and  this\r\n\r\nin turn will be charged on to the tenants who will\r\n\r\nhave  to pay such a high rate of interest. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould like an explanation for such a high rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest charged on this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> First of all, Sir, the Member for Paya\r\n\r\nLebar raised some interesting points in connection\r\n\r\nwith   the   existing  rents  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust and I shall be very glad  if  he\r\n\r\ncan come and discuss the matter with me some time.\r\n\r\nThe  points raised are very involved and  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  it is rather difficult to discuss them  over\r\n\r\nthe floor of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the increase in the cost of\r\n\r\nhousing, I think that most Members will agree that\r\n\r\nthis  is  perhaps the most elaborate scheme  which\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust has ever evolved.\r\n\r\nIt  makes  a  very serious attempt to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nquestion of slum clearance and to erect on central\r\n\r\nsites  which  are very expensive and require  much\r\n\r\npreparation  houses which we hope  will  last  for\r\n\r\nmany years and provide suitable accommodation  for\r\n\r\nthe  poorest  classes in Singapore. The  cost  has\r\n\r\nincreased owing to building costs going up but, in\r\n\r\nthe  main,  to the cost of acquiring and preparing\r\n\r\nvery difficult sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the points raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon, we do hope that every interest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will endeavour to build  houses  either\r\n\r\nfor  sale  or  letting and thus ease  the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of interest rates raised\r\n\r\nby  my  friend the Member for Telok Ayer,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested  in the past by  Members  on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of  the  House that the  interest  rate  on\r\n\r\nexisting  loans from Government to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust should perhaps be reduced  to  2\r\n\r\nper  cent.  Indeed, I think that in the past,  the\r\n\r\nHon, the Chief Minister has himself advocated that\r\n\r\nit  be reduced to nothing! That argument-if it has\r\n\r\nany  validity,  which I confess  I  am  unable  to\r\n\r\nagree-only applies to loans which have  been  made\r\n\r\nfrom surplus funds. All the loans to the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust in the past have been made  from\r\n\r\nfunds which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  been accumulated by Government owing  to  its\r\n\r\ninability to press on with development projects in\r\n\r\nother  directions. Now, of course, we are entering\r\n\r\ninto  a  new phase and as far as the loans to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement  Trust  or   the   housing\r\n\r\nauthority  of  Government are  concerned,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to have to borrow money from the public  to\r\n\r\nre-lend to the Singapore Improvement Trust  or  to\r\n\r\nthe housing authority. In these circumstances,  it\r\n\r\nis  no  more  than  sound finance  to  charge  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement  Trust  the  same  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest and the same terms of the repayment as we\r\n\r\nhave to re-pay the people from whom we borrow  the\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

This form of relief  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be more practical than  an  overall\r\n\r\nreduction of interest rates on loans and will give\r\n\r\nrelief where it is most needed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  that  is as far as we can possibly  go  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  reliefs  for present  tenants  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown was that people are forced to  stay  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Improvement Trust flats.  This  is\r\n\r\ncompletely untrue because my information  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  thousands  of people  on  the  housing\r\n\r\nregister  who  are only too willing  to  be  given\r\n\r\naccommodation  in the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nflats  and, at the same time, those who have  been\r\n\r\nafforded   this  opportunity  have   very   seldom\r\n\r\ncomplained of the question of rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon mentioned certain\r\n\r\npoints but the most important one was the question\r\n\r\nof  the cost of buildings. Here again, Sir, I must\r\n\r\npoint  out to the Member that his figure of $8,000\r\n\r\nper  flat is not quite correct in that it includes\r\n\r\nnot  only  the cost of the building but  also  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  land and site preparation  and  it  also\r\n\r\nincludes  piling, and so on. I will  give  you  an\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir. In the Rochore Road/Albert  Street\r\n\r\narea, the building cost of a 2-room flat is in the\r\n\r\nregion  of  $6,250 which includes piling  cost  of\r\n\r\n$1,200. Here, Sir, the total figure of the cost of\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  the cost of piling  is  $7,450  but\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  the  cost  of  the  land  itself   is\r\n\r\nsomewhere  in the region of $2,500 per unit  which\r\n\r\nnaturally  would  bring the figure  to  well  over\r\n\r\n$8,000  per flat. As I said, Sir, the cost  of  an\r\n\r\nS.I.T. flat  must be looked at from  all  angles,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say, the cost of land, the  cost  of\r\n\r\npreparation  of  sites,  piling  costs  and   then\r\n\r\neventually  the cost of the building  itself.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the old Kallang Airport  area,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  a  2-room flat is $6,300 which  includes\r\n\r\npiling cost of $1,400 whereas in Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere we have put up 200 houses, the building cost\r\n\r\nis  about  $3,200  per  unit,  the  cost  of  site\r\n\r\npreparation  is  $1,590 and the cost  of  land  is\r\n\r\n$123.

It  is,  as  I said, the  most  ambitious\r\n\r\nprogramme   yet   drawn  up   by   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust in its capacity as the  Housing\r\n\r\nAgent  of Government. I do not think that  I  need\r\n\r\nadd  to the Minister's description. My task is  to\r\n\r\ndescribe   the  financial  implications   of   the\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Government has\r\n\r\nalready  undertaken  to provide  funds  for  seven\r\n\r\nHousing  Programmes. Details of these undertakings\r\n\r\nare  given  in Appendix F of the annual  Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  1957 and a summary is given on page 2 of  the\r\n\r\nWhite    Paper   on   Housing   Subsidies.   These\r\n\r\nundertakings  amount  to  $95.9  millions  against\r\n\r\nwhich  $71  millions  have so far  been  advanced.\r\n\r\nProgramme  No. 8 will increase Government's  total\r\n\r\ncommitments to $140 millions of which $70 millions\r\n\r\nstill  remain to be advanced. This, of course,  is\r\n\r\nnot the limit of Government's liability in respect\r\n\r\nof  housing.  With  population increasing  at  its\r\n\r\npresent  rate and the need for a large-scale  slum\r\n\r\nclearance becoming more and more compelling, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   put  a  limit   to   Government's\r\n\r\nliabilities  in  this  respect.  In  the   revised\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan  to  which  reference  was  made\r\n\r\nduring  the Budget debate, allowance was made  for\r\n\r\nan  expenditure of $115 millions on  housing  over\r\n\r\nthe  five  year period from 1958 to 1962  and  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure in subsequent years will no  doubt  be\r\n\r\nof the same order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be clear from these figures that the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  public  housing presents  a  financial\r\n\r\nproblem   of  considerable  magnitude   and   hon.\r\n\r\nMembers, no doubt, wonder where the money is going\r\n\r\nto  come from. Here again, I must refer to what  I\r\n\r\nsaid when introducing the Supply Bill in November.\r\n\r\nSingapore's most urgent needs for capital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment over the next five years are  estimated\r\n\r\nat  $570  millions. This total includes  some  $226\r\n\r\nmillions for general development, $235 millions for\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  and  other  agencies  and  $115\r\n\r\nmillions  for housing. To meet this expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$570  millions,  it is estimated that,  subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions being fulfilled, $280  millions\r\n\r\ncan  be  obtained  from reserves and  contributions\r\n\r\nfrom  the  revenues  of Government  and  the  other\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned and $290 millions from  loans\r\n\r\nincluding   a  special  loan  for  the  electricity\r\n\r\nundertaking  of  the City Council.  The  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich must be fulfilled are briefly as follows: (a)\r\n\r\nthat  Government revenue is increased by stages  to\r\n\r\nyield  at least an additional $50 million by  1959,\r\n\r\nthus  enabling larger contributions to be made from\r\n\r\nrevenue  to development; (b) that the City  Council\r\n\r\nand    other    agencies   can   make   substantial\r\n\r\ncontributions from their revenues towards the  cost\r\n\r\nof their development projects, as they have done in\r\n\r\nthe  past; (c) that a special loan can be  obtained\r\n\r\nfor  further electricity development and  (d)  that\r\n\r\nlocal capital resources are mobilised to the full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these conditions can be fulfilled. The\r\n\r\nmeasures of taxation introduced this year will go a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  way to increasing Government  revenue\r\n\r\nby  the  required  amount and I have  little  doubt\r\n\r\nabout  the  capacity of Singapore  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nbalance  required.  The  City  Council  and   other\r\n\r\nagencies   must   continue  to   make   substantial\r\n\r\ncontributions  from revenue to  development  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the proposals which we will make  for  a\r\n\r\nloan  for  a  new  power  station  will  meet  with\r\n\r\nacceptance.  The  proposals for a national  savings\r\n\r\ncampaign and other steps to mobilise local  capital\r\n\r\nare under active consideration at the present time.\r\n\r\nMembers will hear about them in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other conditions which must\r\n\r\nbe fulfilled. Confidence in Singapore must be built\r\n\r\nup and maintained. We must have peace, security and\r\n\r\nfreedom  to go about our business without  fear  of\r\n\r\ncivil    disturbance,   provoked   by    subversive\r\n\r\ninterests.  The  rule  of law must  be  maintained.\r\n\r\nReason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust be introduced into employer-employee relations\r\n\r\nand the rank and file of trade unions must learn to\r\n\r\nrecognise  and to reject the malevolent  influences\r\n\r\nwhich have hitherto used them for their own ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions can be fulfilled, there is no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  all  the funds which  we  require  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  will be obtained, and Government  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to meet its obligations in the sphere  of\r\n\r\nhousing.  If  these conditions are  not  fulfilled,\r\n\r\nthen I am afraid that we will not be able to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards the terms and conditions, the\r\n\r\nrate of interest proposed for this loan is 5\u00bc per\r\n\r\ncent.  This  is  the same rate of interest  as  was\r\n\r\nagreed  in  the  case of the loan to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board  which was approved  at  the  last\r\n\r\nsitting of the Assembly. It is about the rate which\r\n\r\nwe  should  probably have to offer if we wished  to\r\n\r\nfloat a loan on the Singapore market at the present\r\n\r\ntime. The rate of interest is approximately that of\r\n\r\ncurrent  market  rates and it  follows  the  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  Government  has adhered to  since  it  first\r\n\r\nstarted    advancing   money   to   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. I am sure that it is the correct\r\n\r\npolicy, particularly as the time has now come  when\r\n\r\nmoney  will have to be borrowed from the public  in\r\n\r\norder  to advance it to the Housing Authority.  The\r\n\r\nloan will be repaid over a period of 60 years, this\r\n\r\nbeing  the period taken not only here but in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  as  the  period of  useful  life  for  a\r\n\r\npermanent building for loan repayment purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repayment will be by equal bi-annual instalments\r\n\r\nof principal and interest calculated on the annuity\r\n\r\nsystem. Repayment in this way is preferred  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust to the alternative  of\r\n\r\nequal instalments of principal with interest on the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  the loan outstanding.  The  last  four\r\n\r\nloans are repayable in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of previous loans, the loan will\r\n\r\nbe   secured  by  a  legal  mortgage  of  all   the\r\n\r\nproperties to which the Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nhas legal title\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand by an equitable charge over all properties  to\r\n\r\nwhich the Trust holds equitable title.

This   Government  is   committed   to\r\n\r\nsubsidise   housing.  In  other   words,   it   is\r\n\r\ncommitted,  whatever the form of the  subsidy,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  housing below the normal economic  rates.\r\n\r\nIf the Government continues this practice which it\r\n\r\npursued  in the past of just borrowing  money  and\r\n\r\nacting  as the guarantor and re-lending it to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement  Trust  on  mortgage,   in\r\n\r\neffect,  there is no housing subsidy.  People  pay\r\n\r\neconomic  rents  to  defray  both  the   cost   of\r\n\r\nmanagement and the cost of the interest rate. Now,\r\n\r\nwe were told by the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing that there is going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  the rents of the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  flats  and  houses - to redeem  his  election\r\n\r\npledge.  However we juggle between the rents  paid\r\n\r\nby  the  new houses and the low rents paid on  the\r\n\r\nprewar   houses  or  the  earlier   built   houses\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  rents for the prewar  houses  and\r\n\r\ndecreasing  slightly  the rents  for  the  postwar\r\n\r\nhouses, the fact remains that the total collection\r\n\r\nof  rents  must  be  sufficient  to  pay  cost  of\r\n\r\nmanagement  and the interest rate.

According to the White Paper as  explained\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing,  the  plan  is to fix rentals  below  the\r\n\r\neconomic rent and the deficit will be made up by a\r\n\r\nvote  in  this Assembly annually. Hence that  vote\r\n\r\nwill represent the annual subsidy for housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on principle, there is nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nthat plan. I am told also that from the accounting\r\n\r\npoint   of   view,  everything  will  be   clearly\r\n\r\ndisclosed and not concealed. But I think Ministers\r\n\r\non  the  other side must also be aware  that  this\r\n\r\nmeans an annual debate. This means, in effect, the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  subsidies  going   up   or   down\r\n\r\ndepending upon the play of local political  forces\r\n\r\nyear by year, perhaps even month by month. I would\r\n\r\nask  them  seriously to consider  some  method  by\r\n\r\nwhich once a subsidy rate has been fixed, it stays\r\n\r\nthere  until there is, as a result of major policy\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the Government, a need to revise  the\r\n\r\nwhole   subsidy  rate,  otherwise  like  the   old\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, we will have it  up  every\r\n\r\nyear.  I do not think this is to the advantage  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  reside  in houses  subsidised  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It appears to me on principle  to  be\r\n\r\nnot   altogether   a   satisfactory   method    of\r\n\r\nsubsidising housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

Even one cent a katty less in the price  of\r\n\r\nrice is something to the poor man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed, I would like to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  prewar  history of rice. During that  period,\r\n\r\nrice was sold at five to seven cents a katty. Even\r\n\r\nduring the war, before the Japanese attacked,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazettes  I have  here  show  that  in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1940, the price of rice was from five to\r\n\r\nseven  cents a katty. In March 1941, it was  seven\r\n\r\ncents  a katty. Then in May 1941, it was from  six\r\n\r\nto nine cents a katty. I have quoted these figures\r\n\r\nalso  for the benefit of my friends who are on  my\r\n\r\nside  of the House, especially for the P.A.P. who\r\n\r\ncall themselves the People's Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No \"Action\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir, rice is produced\r\n\r\nthroughout South-East Asia: in Burma, Thailand and\r\n\r\nIndo-China.  Rice  was imported  here  during  the\r\n\r\nprewar  period  all the time and re-exported  from\r\n\r\nhere.  Rice  from  Burma was exported  to  Africa,\r\n\r\nCeylon and many other countries and rice from Indo-China  and  Thailand was also exported to  various\r\n\r\ncountries.  We  have the shipping facilities  over\r\n\r\nhere in addition to the low handling charges which\r\n\r\nmake it possible for those countries to ship their\r\n\r\nrice here for our local merchants to re-export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the prewar period till December\r\n\r\n1941,  I was a member of the Food Advisory Council\r\n\r\nand  we  had  a  plan by which every family  could\r\n\r\nstore a bag of rice for an emergency. Now, Sir, in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1942, the 100 years of British rule ended\r\n\r\nwithin  only  nine  weeks. Then  the  British  re-occupied  this  territory again in September  1945\r\n\r\nwith  the help of the Allies and during that  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Japanese left, things  were  in  chaos.\r\n\r\nThere was shortage of every foodstuff and consumer\r\n\r\ngoods.  During  that period which  was  under  the\r\n\r\nBritish   Military  Administration,  a  department\r\n\r\ncalled the Supplies Department came into being. It\r\n\r\nwas  a  great  necessity, at  that  time,  to  get\r\n\r\nsupplies  from  every possible  source  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  shipping was scarce and the prices were  not\r\n\r\nsteady and therefore that department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  very necessary. As time went on, things  were\r\n\r\nbecoming  normal.  Many things were  de-controlled\r\n\r\nand there was no restriction on imports. Flour and\r\n\r\nsugar  were  the  last  to be de-controlled.  Rice\r\n\r\nshould  also  have been de-controlled about  three\r\n\r\nyears ago when the supplies were plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the days from September 1945 when the\r\n\r\nBritish  occupied this territory till three  years\r\n\r\nago, rice was sold from the producing countries on\r\n\r\na   government  to  government  basis.   All   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Governments  in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia  used to meet here and arrange the allocation\r\n\r\nof   rice  amongst  themselves  at  a  round-table\r\n\r\nconference presided over by the then Commissioner-General. Each country was allocated its quota.  So\r\n\r\nfar,  it  worked quite well as it was  a  seller's\r\n\r\nmarket.  Nobody  could  import  rice  on  his  own\r\n\r\naccount though we have heard the smuggling of rice\r\n\r\ndid  take place from Thailand into the Federation.\r\n\r\nI  think  that Government's objection to free  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of rice at that time was correct but  then\r\n\r\nthe time came, Sir, when rice was plentiful. Burma\r\n\r\nhas been sending delegations to sell rice to every\r\n\r\npossible  country. Thailand has  enough  rice  and\r\n\r\neven  if  there  is trouble in Indo-China  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot import rice from her in the future, I think\r\n\r\nthere  are  plenty  of  supplies  available   from\r\n\r\nelsewhere and there can be no shortage. Even China\r\n\r\nis supplying rice to Ceylon and only the other day\r\n\r\nI  read from a newspaper report that 5,000 tons of\r\n\r\nrice from China was arriving in Singapore for  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if rice is plentiful, is it necessary\r\n\r\nto  maintain  a  department costing  the  taxpayer\r\n\r\nabout $68,000 to $70,000 a year? In addition, Sir,\r\n\r\nGovernment has its own stockpile policy and I will\r\n\r\ndeal  with  that  later at length but  the  system\r\n\r\nprevailing is that if an importer has to import  a\r\n\r\ncertain  quantity of rice, he has to buy one-third\r\n\r\nof that quantity from the Government stockpile.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  Government  has  a   continuous\r\n\r\nstockpile  of 11,000 to 15,000 tons of rice.  Sir,\r\n\r\nGovernment has to pay the handling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges, the godown rents - if the godowns  belong\r\n\r\nto  the Government, then the rents which could be\r\n\r\nderived  from them by letting them  out  will  be\r\n\r\nlost  to  the  Government - and  perhaps  insurance\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  not sure about. There is  also  the\r\n\r\npossibility of the rice deteriorating. All  these\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into account and added on to the\r\n\r\nprice at which the importer has to buy this  one-third quantity from the Government stockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give some figures to show how the\r\n\r\nmasses  have suffered by payment from revenue  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the huge losses in the past. In 1953,  over\r\n\r\n$4  million  was lost. In 1954, it was $2,441,000\r\n\r\nand in 1955, there was a profit of $413,000. Now,\r\n\r\nthis  Government might say, \"Well, that  was  not\r\n\r\nour pigeon. It was under a different government.\"\r\n\r\nBut   then  I  would  ask  whether  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  working for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  or  not? In 1956, the loss was  $278,958.\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  point out that this is  a  minority\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Yesterday,  I  read  that,  on   the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Bill, Government won by 16 to 11 votes.\r\n\r\nNow,  out  of  those  16 votes,  you  have  three\r\n\r\nNominated and three ex-officios which add  up  to\r\n\r\nsix,  thus  leaving ten who are actually  elected\r\n\r\nMembers  as  against 11 Opposition  Members,  not\r\n\r\ncounting the one Member who is detained. This  is\r\n\r\nhow  the  Government functions from day  to  day.\r\n\r\n[Interruption.] Sir, it may be so, but  you  have\r\n\r\nto  have your responsibilities to the people  and\r\n\r\nyou  should not forget that but for how long  can\r\n\r\nyou  carry  on  with the votes  of  the  colonial\r\n\r\npower?

Sir, why is this done? The Government\r\n\r\nsay that they must have a stockpile. For what?  I\r\n\r\nunderstand - unless   Government   contradicts - that\r\n\r\nthis  emergency  stock is very necessary  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people. Why? It  is  said  that\r\n\r\nthere may be war again or it is possible that the\r\n\r\nCommunists  might attack Burma or Thailand  which\r\n\r\nwill  affect Singapore or Malaya. What I  say  to\r\n\r\nthem  is  this, Sir. A hundred years  of  British\r\n\r\nrule was ended within the space of nine weeks. If\r\n\r\nBurma  or  Thailand were to fall what can  we  do\r\n\r\nhere?  How long can we protect ourselves?  I  ask\r\n\r\nthose  questions.  This is nothing  but  a  bogey\r\n\r\nbased on unnecessary fears. I suggest that it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary to have any stockpile at  all  and\r\n\r\ntax the people indirectly by making them pay more\r\n\r\nfor  rice.  Let me ask another question.  Who  is\r\n\r\ngoing to attack whom in this part of the world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  aggressor  today is the minority  Government\r\n\r\nwho  have  made the Opposition mad the  way  they\r\n\r\nkeep on talking to cover their mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rice is available and is wanted. There is\r\n\r\nno  necessity for any stockpile and there  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  any control on the rice trade. I may  be\r\n\r\ntold  that there is no control whatsoever  but  I\r\n\r\nsay that there is control of rice. If one imports\r\n\r\nrice  from  another country, he has to  buy  one-third   of   the  quantity  imported   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and at Government rate. If that is not\r\n\r\ncontrol, then what is it called?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if rice is not controlled, it will\r\n\r\nstabilise  automatically at its own  price  level\r\n\r\nlike any other commodity. If the argument is that\r\n\r\nit cannot be done or that it will not be so, then\r\n\r\nwhy not control the other commodities too? You\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   sugar  and  flour,  etc.,  which  are   not\r\n\r\ncontrolled. Why is control limited to rice only? I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  hear  an  explanation  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment as to why this is necessary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that my motion will be\r\n\r\ndefeated by the Government. I am not surprised  at\r\n\r\nthat as they have seven extra votes which are  not\r\n\r\nthe  people's votes and it is because of the votes\r\n\r\nof  the  colonial power that make it possible  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  defeat us. What I will say  to  them  is\r\n\r\nthis: they have already dug their graves and  they\r\n\r\nwill be burying themselves if we are defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I hope to send a wreath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Why should I not get  a  straight\r\n\r\nanswer  as to who are the importers and exporters?\r\n\r\nThe licences to import rice, I am told, are issued\r\n\r\nfreely to applicants and are they not regularised?\r\n\r\nIs  no record made? One has to apply for a licence\r\n\r\nto import rice and there must be a record of that.\r\n\r\nThe  information required as to what is  happening\r\n\r\nwill  help the People's Action Party make  up  its\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is so obvious?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Now,  what\r\n\r\nhappens,   Sir,  is  this.  Besides  the  handling\r\n\r\ncharges, the insurance and the godown rents,  rice\r\n\r\nis bought through a middleman or a broker. This is\r\n\r\nwhat  I wanted to prove from my question. In other\r\n\r\nwords, all these factors are added on to the cost.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, you buy a pencil directly from  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  cost you cheaper than if you were to buy  it\r\n\r\nthrough  a  middleman who will  want  to  add  his\r\n\r\ncommission on to the cost. The consumer will  then\r\n\r\nhave to pay much more for it here. That was why  I\r\n\r\nraised that question. In other words, the consumer\r\n\r\npays  more  for  everything that  Government  does\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing more to say and I beg to\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nsecond the motion.

At that time,  when  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers were in power, they  were  not\r\n\r\nin  any  way concerned about the question  of  the\r\n\r\nstaple  food  for Asians although, as was  pointed\r\n\r\nout  by  the  mover of the motion, it was  thought\r\n\r\nnecessary to control rice as there was a  shortage\r\n\r\nof  rice. This control is now out-of-date  because\r\n\r\nwe  all know that we can get rice everywhere at  a\r\n\r\nfar  cheaper  price. Rice is imported  from  every\r\n\r\ncountry  and  I  do not see why  this  control  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  In fact, public money is wasted  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate  department has to be set up  to  control\r\n\r\nand distribute rice. If this money is utilised for\r\n\r\nmore  social welfare work, I think that the public\r\n\r\nwill  be far more benefited. This control  is  not\r\n\r\nonly causing hardship to the consumers, as pointed\r\n\r\nout  by the Member for Telok Ayer, but I think  it\r\n\r\nis  also causing hardship to the retailers as well\r\n\r\nas   to   the  wholesalers  because  everyone   is\r\n\r\naffected.  The trouble starts from the Government,\r\n\r\ndownwards  to  the wholesaler, passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\nretailer and the worst sufferer is the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that not only the price of\r\n\r\ncontrolled rice is dearer but that the \"free\" rice\r\n\r\nis  of  a better quality than controlled rice.  If\r\n\r\nyou  buy  free rice from anywhere and  compare  it\r\n\r\nwith  controlled rice, you will find  that  it  is\r\n\r\nfar, far better, as I myself have bought free rice\r\n\r\nand  controlled rice. So there is no sense at  all\r\n\r\nin controlling rice. Why not throw it open and let\r\n\r\nit  be  run  on a competitive basis? We have  many\r\n\r\nwholesalers here who are prepared to import  rice.\r\n\r\nLet  them run the trade on a competitive basis and\r\n\r\nlet  the consumer benefit as it is the staple food\r\n\r\nof  the Asians. Without this staple food, an Asian\r\n\r\nfinds it difficult to exist. An argument given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government is that it is a precaution against\r\n\r\na  possible  war.  How ridiculous  is  that,  Sir!\r\n\r\nAgain,  it  was pointed out by the mover  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion that there should not be any such fear of a\r\n\r\npossible   war.  All  Asian  countries   are   now\r\n\r\npromoting  peace and I do not see  why  we  should\r\n\r\nfear  the possibility of such a war here. The only\r\n\r\nenemy  that  we  are afraid of, I think,  are  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  they  are within  Malaya.  So  we\r\n\r\nshould   not  have  any  fear  from  any   outside\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Even  China is now prepared  to  sell\r\n\r\nrice  to  Malaya and Singapore. I have  been  told\r\n\r\nthat  before,  China suffered from a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nrice and it was rationed but now, according to the\r\n\r\ndelegation  which  went to  China,  it  can  offer\r\n\r\n25,000  tons  of rice to Malaya. Just imagine  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of 25,000 tons of rice offered! Therefore,\r\n\r\nyou can see where is the necessity for controlling\r\n\r\nrice.  The question of control comes in only  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a shortage of rice but if supply exceeds\r\n\r\ndemand, there is no necessity for its control.  If\r\n\r\nsupply far exceeds demand, then why control rice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the public should not be made\r\n\r\nto  suffer  because  of  the  foolishness  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in enforcing this control. I have again\r\n\r\nand  again  said  that control  encourages  black-market:  the  more  you  control,  the  more   you\r\n\r\nencourage black-market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose\r\n\r\nto  deal with the technical details of this matter\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  be  better handled by the Minister for  Trade\r\n\r\nand Commerce but I would like to make one point of\r\n\r\ngeneral   importance.  We  have  had  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nreferences  to  the controls during  the  time  of\r\n\r\nsevere  shortage and to the black-market  of  rice\r\n\r\nand  I  think that it might be helpful to Members,\r\n\r\nin   thinking  about  this  problem,  to  have  an\r\n\r\nassessment  of  what actually did happen  and  the\r\n\r\ndegree  to which the public was exploited, not  by\r\n\r\nthe controlled rice provided by the Government but\r\n\r\nby  the  black-market rice provided  by  the  rice\r\n\r\ntrade. This is from \"The Economy of Malaya\" by the\r\n\r\nProfessor  of Economics, University of Malaya.  He\r\n\r\nestimates that for 1947, the total sales of black-market  rice  were between $250 million  and  $300\r\n\r\nmillion  and  this was a margin of  125  per  cent\r\n\r\nabove  the  control price. He derives  from  these\r\n\r\nfigures  the deduction that nearly 50 per cent  or\r\n\r\nwell over $100 million went in profits to the rice\r\n\r\ntrade.  That was at a time of shortage -  if  these\r\n\r\nfigures  are correct; they have never been refuted\r\n\r\nalthough  the  pamphlet is  more  than  two  years\r\n\r\nold - when  the  rice traders made a  very  handsome\r\n\r\nprofit  indeed,  thank you, out of the  sufferings\r\n\r\nand  hardships  of the people.  They  did  so  not\r\n\r\nbecause  there  were  controls  but  because   the\r\n\r\ncontrols were not good enough. They were  able  to\r\n\r\ndefeat them at a time when the Government was ill-organised  as  a result of the great  difficulties\r\n\r\narising from the Japanese occupation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that it is valuable to bear in mind\r\n\r\nthat  if  you have the rice trade solely  operated\r\n\r\nfor  profit with no element of Government interest\r\n\r\nor  control at all, you are putting the poor man's\r\n\r\nrice bowl at the mercy of businessmen who, in  the\r\n\r\nnatural  course of capitalist business, will  seek\r\n\r\nto  get as much as they can out of it. It would be\r\n\r\nabsurd   to   suppose  that  they  will  sacrifice\r\n\r\npossible profits in order that the consumer should\r\n\r\nget  his  rice  more cheaply. That  would  be  the\r\n\r\nfunction  of  the  Government food  supply  system\r\n\r\nrather  than  of  a  private  enterprise  and,  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with that, I have a newspaper  cutting\r\n\r\nin my hand which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nehru's economic programme envisages the\r\n\r\ncreation of state trading corporations to  be  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation soon to import and stock essential\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs,   a   method  to  counter   widespread\r\n\r\nspeculation in rice and wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just make these very general points, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  which  are,  however,  relevant  to  the\r\n\r\ndebate.

The flesh and  blood  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses  have been built up since birth with  rice.\r\n\r\nTo  free  rice or to give up stockpiling rice  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the masses would mean  that  in  a\r\n\r\ntime  of  crisis, the masses will not be  provided\r\n\r\nfor  with  rice, their staple food.

It is a \"must\" in every household  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry and, as such, it is the paramount duty  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to reduce the cost of rice to  the\r\n\r\nlowest  possible  level  so  that  the  consumers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the working class, will benefit  from\r\n\r\nit. Yet, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrange  that Government sees fit to maintain  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Control of Supplies on  the  flimsy\r\n\r\nexcuse  that  it  is necessary  because  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmeasure in case of war. This is sheer nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that Government will refuse to\r\n\r\nsupport the motion before the House not because it\r\n\r\nis  against  the interest of the people,  so  they\r\n\r\nclaim,  but because a Member on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse had the foresight to introduce such a motion\r\n\r\ninto  this  House. I can quote, for instance,  why\r\n\r\nthe  consumers are now paying more for  what  they\r\n\r\nshould  pay. For B rice, it is 10 per  cent  more.\r\n\r\nGovernment  sells  to the dealers  at  $27.14  per\r\n\r\npikul and the same quality of rice is sold in  the\r\n\r\nopen  market by the dealers to anybody at $24  per\r\n\r\npikul - less $3.14 per pikul of rice. This $3.14  is\r\n\r\npassed on to the consumer. Why? It is because  for\r\n\r\nevery  1,000  bags of rice that a  dealer  imports\r\n\r\ninto  this  country, Government  forces  the  same\r\n\r\ndealer to buy 500 bags from the stockpile; that is\r\n\r\nto say, for every two bags imported, he has to buy\r\n\r\none  bag from the stockpile. Therefore, this $3.14\r\n\r\nis not a loss to the importer but it is just added\r\n\r\non  to the price of rice which is imported.  If  a\r\n\r\nconsumer  goes to a grocery shop to buy  rice,  he\r\n\r\nhas  to  pay more. For C rice, it is 15  per  cent\r\n\r\nmore.  Government sells to the dealers  at  $26.43\r\n\r\nper pikul and the same quality of rice is sold  by\r\n\r\nthe  dealers at $22 per pikul. I can quote another\r\n\r\ninstance  from information which I have  received.\r\n\r\nThe  successful dealer who intends to  tender  for\r\n\r\nthe sale of rice to Government for stockpiling has\r\n\r\nto pay the sum of $4,000 for 1,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The extra price that the consumer has  to\r\n\r\npay,  because of the existence of a stockpile,  is\r\n\r\nabout a cent per katty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer quoted pre-war prices\r\n\r\nof rice.

However, I do not  see\r\n\r\nwhat  relation that has with the stockpile because\r\n\r\nthe price of rice is something beyond our control.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  price that is dictated by the producing\r\n\r\ncountries to the buying countries and as you had a\r\n\r\nseller's  market a few years ago, they  took  very\r\n\r\ngood  care to see that they got the very best  out\r\n\r\nof  their  rice  because  rice  formed  the  major\r\n\r\nportion  of  their economy. Even now, Sir,  though\r\n\r\nrice  is in plentiful supply, the prices have  not\r\n\r\ngone  down  to  any appreciable level.  \"Rice  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  imported here and  re-exported  from\r\n\r\nhere.\"  That  is what the hon.

I did not have  figures  of  the\r\n\r\ntranshipped  rice from Singapore on through  Bills\r\n\r\nof  Lading  because  we do  not  have  records  of\r\n\r\ntranshipments  on  through  Bills  of  Lading  but\r\n\r\naccording to the figures here, from July  1955  to\r\n\r\nJune  1956,  more than 100,000 tons of  rice  have\r\n\r\nbeen re-exported from Singapore. Half of that  has\r\n\r\nbeen sent to the Federation of Malaya and about  a\r\n\r\nsimilar quantity to Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of talk about the\r\n\r\ncontrol  and the de-control of rice and  I  notice\r\n\r\nalso that the motion puts in the words \" . . . and\r\n\r\nthat trading in rice should be free.\" Sir, rice is\r\n\r\nnot   controlled  at  the  moment.  Rice  was  de-controlled  in 1953 or 1954 - I have the exact  date\r\n\r\nsomewhere.   Since  then,  rice   has   not   been\r\n\r\ncontrolled. What is happening is that there  is  a\r\n\r\nstockpile  obligation on the part of the merchants\r\n\r\nto  buy  a  certain  quantity,  according  to  his\r\n\r\nimports,  from  the  stockpile  but  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncontrol  on  rice as such. Anybody  who  wants  to\r\n\r\nimport  rice  is  free  to  do  so,  provided   he\r\n\r\nundertakes to buy the corresponding ratio from the\r\n\r\nstockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer also said that in 1953\r\n\r\nwhen  other  items like flour and sugar  were  de-controlled,  it was not thought fit to  de-control\r\n\r\nrice, meaning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it was not thought fit to exempt it from  the\r\n\r\nstockpile. But the stockpile decision was taken in\r\n\r\n1953  by  the  then  Government in  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil of which the hon. Member did take part and\r\n\r\nthat  decision of the then Executive  Council  was\r\n\r\nthat all commodities should be de-controlled, that\r\n\r\nthere  should be no price control, and that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no restriction on import  except  that\r\n\r\nrice  should be under a stockpile obligation.  The\r\n\r\nstockpile  was  fixed in that  year  by  the  then\r\n\r\nGovernment of which the hon. Member was  a  Member\r\n\r\nin  the Executive Council. It may have been a more\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government than it probably is  now.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary 1954, a working party was set up with  Mr\r\n\r\nTan Chin Tuan as the Chairman and they tried their\r\n\r\nbest   to  get  an  acceptable  solution  to   the\r\n\r\nstockpile  by  trying  to  get  a  guarantee  from\r\n\r\ntraders, but it was found that none of the Chinese\r\n\r\nor  the  European  business  interests  would  co-operate  in  giving a guarantee  that  they  would\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  stockpile  of their  own  free  will.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a decision was taken in the  middle  of\r\n\r\n1954  that  a  stockpile should be maintained.  In\r\n\r\nessence, the stockpile is still the same today and\r\n\r\nthere  is no change. So it is wrong to say that  a\r\n\r\nstockpile  was then necessary because rice  was  a\r\n\r\nseller's market and in short supply. In fact, rice\r\n\r\nbecame  a  buyer's market in 1953 and I will  give\r\n\r\nyou  the  proof why it became so. The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nquoted figures showing that the Government lost $4\r\n\r\nmillion in 1953 and a couple of million dollars in\r\n\r\n1954. Now, why did the Government lose that amount\r\n\r\nof  money  on  rice? It was not our Government  at\r\n\r\nthat  time. It was a more colonial Government with\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  taking part  in  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil  thereof  but  Government  did  lose  that\r\n\r\namount of money and the reason was this. The  year\r\n\r\nbefore,  it had been decided to allow free imports\r\n\r\nof grades that were either superior or inferior to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's rationing grades. I  hope  I  am\r\n\r\nclear on that. A certain type of rice was imported\r\n\r\nby  Government for rationing purposes. Now, if you\r\n\r\nwanted  to  import  better or inferior  rice  than\r\n\r\nthat,  you  were at liberty. There was no  control\r\n\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   position  had  become  such  that  when  the\r\n\r\ncountries  started  producing  so  much  rice  our\r\n\r\nmerchants  here  imported a big  quantity  of  the\r\n\r\nsuperior  grade rice and they were  able  to  sell\r\n\r\nmuch  cheaper than the Government could  sell  its\r\n\r\nrationed rice. This showed that rice was  in  free\r\n\r\nsupply and that there was no short supply of  rice\r\n\r\nin   the   producing  countries  at   that   time.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when  the Government here  found  that\r\n\r\nthey could not sell their rice unless they lowered\r\n\r\ntheir  price because the merchants were  importing\r\n\r\nbetter  rice  and selling it at a  cheaper  price,\r\n\r\nthey had to lower their price and sell the rice at\r\n\r\na  loss. That was why there was a loss. It was not\r\n\r\nthe  fault of our Government and I would  not  say\r\n\r\nthat it was the fault of the then Government,  but\r\n\r\nthe  position is clear that rice was not in  short\r\n\r\nsupply  at that time and yet, in spite of that,  a\r\n\r\ndecision was taken to maintain a stockpile. So  it\r\n\r\nis clear that the stockpile decision was not based\r\n\r\non  the  availability of rice or the short  supply\r\n\r\nposition  of  rice  but  was  based  on  emergency\r\n\r\nrequirements and the same position stands now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suspicion, Sir, that behind this move\r\n\r\nis  not so much the interest of the masses but the\r\n\r\ninterest of the merchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mostly Telok Ayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the role of the\r\n\r\nmerchants in the old days was different  from  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the merchants today. At that  time,  any\r\n\r\nmerchant  prince  could  carry  on  any  trade  or\r\n\r\ncommerce  he liked, thinking only of the  benefits\r\n\r\nand  the  profits that accrued to him and  if  the\r\n\r\ncountry did benefit, to a certain extent,  it  was\r\n\r\njust incidental but there was no obligation on the\r\n\r\npart  of the merchant to provide a service to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   Now,  conceptions  have  changed.   The\r\n\r\nmerchant  now says that he is providing a  service\r\n\r\nto  the community and therefore if he is providing\r\n\r\na  service to the community, he should fit in with\r\n\r\nthe general scheme of things in that community and\r\n\r\nwith  the  general requirements of that community.\r\n\r\nIf the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral  requirements of that community  demand  a\r\n\r\nsafety factor in a stockpile, I do not see why the\r\n\r\nmerchant  should grumble especially as he  is  not\r\n\r\npaying  for that stockpile. The consumer is paying\r\n\r\na little more in the price as an insurance premium\r\n\r\nfor  some  future  unknown contingencies  but  the\r\n\r\nmerchant is not paying it so why should he grumble\r\n\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find, Sir, that in all enlightened\r\n\r\ncountries,   the  activities  of   merchants   are\r\n\r\nharnessed to the needs of the country and they are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to carry on haphazardly like the  old\r\n\r\nmerchant   princes  were  allowed  to  carry   on,\r\n\r\nthinking   only  of  themselves   and   if   their\r\n\r\nactivities do clash with the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, a check is put on them. You have  quotas,\r\n\r\ntariffs,  and  so  on, which  are  checks  on  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  trade because of the need to  harness\r\n\r\nthe  activities of the merchants to the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe community and I think our merchants should not\r\n\r\ngrumble over that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the taxpayer has to\r\n\r\npay  the  cost  of  the  upkeep  of  the  Supplies\r\n\r\nDepartment - $60,000 to $70,000 a year.  That,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  not  true. Perhaps the hon. Members have  been\r\n\r\nmisinformed. If they had cared to come and ask me,\r\n\r\nI  would have enlightened them. If they had  cared\r\n\r\nto  look up the Budget when it was presented, they\r\n\r\nwould  have seen that that is not so. The cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  Supplies Department is borne by the stockpile\r\n\r\nand the consumer, in that the extra one cent he is\r\n\r\npaying,  is paying for the upkeep of the  Supplies\r\n\r\nDepartment.  There  is  no  extra  cost   to   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, figures have been quoted to show that the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  lost about $280,000 last year and  that,\r\n\r\nin  1955,  there  was a profit of  $413,000.  Now,\r\n\r\nagain  I  want  to  make it very  clear  that  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  is  not  paying this loss.  We  run  the\r\n\r\nstockpile  on  a  no  profit, no  loss  basis  and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  when  I found that the  stockpile  had\r\n\r\nmade  a  profit of $413,000, I issued a  directive\r\n\r\nthat  we  should reduce the price of rice so  that\r\n\r\nthe  profit  which  we had accumulated  should  go\r\n\r\nback,  by giving a reduction in the price, to  the\r\n\r\nconsumer  until  that  profit  was  absorbed.  The\r\n\r\nstockpile, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepeat,  is run on a no profit, no loss basis.  If\r\n\r\nwe  make a profit, we reduce the price of rice and\r\n\r\nwe  give the profit back to the consumer and if we\r\n\r\nmake  a  loss, we increase the price slightly  and\r\n\r\nrecover  the  loss. This \"bad\" Government  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front   Coalition,  the   much   maligned\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Labour Front and the \"minority\"\r\n\r\nGovernment,  has  reduced the price  of  stockpile\r\n\r\nrice  four  times  after it took office.  On  15th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1955, before the elections, ten per cent\r\n\r\nrice  was  $494  and fifteen per  cent  was  $476.\r\n\r\nImmediately after taking office, on 12th May,  the\r\n\r\nprice  was reduced all round by $15; on 7th  July,\r\n\r\nanother  $15 reduction; on 13th January,  1956,  a\r\n\r\nfurther  $15 reduction and on 1st February,  1956,\r\n\r\nanother $10 - a total reduction up to February which\r\n\r\nwent  on till 11th September, 1956, of $55,  since\r\n\r\nthis \"bad\" Government took over. However, when the\r\n\r\nGovernment had to buy dearer rice, they had to put\r\n\r\nthe price up slightly and on 12th September, 1956,\r\n\r\nwe  increased the price by $20, still giving a net\r\n\r\nreduction of $35 since the time we took office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general comment is that this \"minority\"\r\n\r\nGovernment  moves on haphazardly from day  to  day\r\n\r\nand  yet,  Sir,  it is this \"minority\"  Government\r\n\r\nwhich is moving on so haphazardly that is going to\r\n\r\nget us merdeka, if we at all do get merdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

There  is  no\r\n\r\nmakeshift  about it. There is no  control  and  no\r\n\r\nartificial  fixing of prices. It is stabilised  at\r\n\r\nthe  price  the producing countries can afford  to\r\n\r\nsell  and  according  to the  law  of  supply  and\r\n\r\ndemand.   Where   does   Government   create    an\r\n\r\ninstability in the price? It does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why control rice only? Why do you not control\r\n\r\nsugar, flour and a host of other things?\" The hon.\r\n\r\nMember  himself gave the answer in the early  part\r\n\r\nof  his  speech and that is, \"Rice is  the  staple\r\n\r\nfood.\"  Unless you have this staple food available\r\n\r\nin an emergency, you will have starvation. But one\r\n\r\ncan  live  without sugar and flour: at least,  our\r\n\r\npopulation  is accustomed more to rice-eating  and\r\n\r\nas  to  rice and flour, they both serve  the  same\r\n\r\npurpose;  they are both starchy. I think,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nread  in  hygiene books when I was schooling  that\r\n\r\nstarch  turns into sugar when you put it  in  your\r\n\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was made that rice is bought by\r\n\r\nmiddlemen - that  is. Indian and Pakistani  rice - and\r\n\r\nthe  consumer pays more. This is a free  port.  We\r\n\r\ncannot   control  anybody  if  he  wants  to   buy\r\n\r\nanything.  Why  blame us if a middleman  who  buys\r\n\r\nrice  from  India  or Pakistan is  not  a  regular\r\n\r\ndealer?  I  do  not know what the  term  \"regular\"\r\n\r\nmeans  because Singapore is a free  port  and  the\r\n\r\nactivities of trade are free. But if the middleman\r\n\r\nwants  to  make a bit of extra profit, the  direct\r\n\r\nimporter will undercut him and it will not be long\r\n\r\nbefore the middleman will not be able to reap  his\r\n\r\nprofit.  The Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee  Choon\r\n\r\nEng)  also  talked on the same lines, Sir,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink   that   I   have  answered  his   arguments\r\n\r\nsufficiently well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point that was raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang (Mr Goh Tong Liang) was  that  the\r\n\r\nmerchants are prepared to guarantee a stockpile of\r\n\r\n25,000   tons.   Sir,  when  the   stockpile   was\r\n\r\nsuggested,  at its very inception in  1953,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out, they did try under Mr Tan Chin\r\n\r\nTuan  to try to get the trade to agree to maintain\r\n\r\na  stockpile but they failed and the same position\r\n\r\nstill holds good today. We tried even last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear to get the traders to sit around and come  to\r\n\r\nan  agreement  to keep a stockpile  on  their  own\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  we even  offered  to  advance\r\n\r\nmoney to them if they would keep the stockpile  of\r\n\r\nrice in Government godowns so that they would  not\r\n\r\nbe  financially  embarrassed by locking  up  their\r\n\r\ncapital for stockpile purposes. But no, they would\r\n\r\nnot  come  to  an understanding and they  refused.\r\n\r\nThey  gave a general guarantee which was very much\r\n\r\nin the air: \"Oh, yes, do not worry. We will keep a\r\n\r\nstockpile.\"  Is  that of any real value  when  you\r\n\r\nhave  an emergency? What will happen is that  rice\r\n\r\nwill  disappear in the black market  and  probably\r\n\r\nall  the  rich Members of this Assembly and  other\r\n\r\nrich  people will get their rice because they  can\r\n\r\nafford the black market price but not the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe poor public. They cannot afford the price.  So\r\n\r\na  guarantee in general terms is no use unless the\r\n\r\ntraders  can agree to a specific scheme of putting\r\n\r\nso  much  rice in a godown and getting an  advance\r\n\r\nfrom  Government on it. But they  refuse  to  give\r\n\r\napproval for such a scheme. Therefore, it  is  not\r\n\r\nour  fault that this sort of idea does not operate\r\n\r\nand that we are forced to carry on a stockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was made by the Member for Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\n(Mr  William Tan) that if we lift the control  of\r\n\r\nrice,  the  price  will  drop.  That  is  a   mis-statement.  The  price is not  controlled  by  us.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no price control here. Neither  is  the\r\n\r\ncost of rice controlled by us. The cost of rice is\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the selling countries, not by us and\r\n\r\nthe  rice is bought at the price operating in  the\r\n\r\nselling  countries either by us or by  the  trade.\r\n\r\nBoth have to pay the same price. Therefore, if  we\r\n\r\nexclude the stockpile obligation, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  the price will drop. It only means that  the\r\n\r\nextra  one  cent  which is added  because  of  the\r\n\r\nstockpile obligation will come down. Even that one\r\n\r\ncent  per katty when it is spread over two katties\r\n\r\nwhich is imported direct by the importer comes  to\r\n\r\nhalf  a  cent  per  katty to the  consumer - if  the\r\n\r\nmerchants are honest about it - because they pay one\r\n\r\ncent  more for our one katty of rice but they  buy\r\n\r\ntwo  katties  of  rice cheaper by one  cent,  they\r\n\r\ntherefore get two cents cheaper in the price of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  katties  of rice and if you add this  up,  it\r\n\r\nonly comes to half a cent or less extra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious matter was raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru who mentioned that $4,000 had  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  before a man could tender. Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nhim  very  much to bring the matter up to  me  and\r\n\r\ngive me all the necessary details in confidence if\r\n\r\nhe can. I will say that if he were aware of it, it\r\n\r\nwas  his duty as a public-spirited citizen to have\r\n\r\ngone  to the Anti-Corruption Branch of the  Police\r\n\r\nand  informed them.

He said that it  was\r\n\r\nunlikely that a war should break out in this  part\r\n\r\nof  the  world because the neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nhave  no  time  for wars and that they  were  busy\r\n\r\nabout their own economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Famous last words!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

In  the sick position that the world  is  in\r\n\r\ntoday,  Sir,  it is presumptuous on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nanyone to prophesy when war\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis or is not going to break out. It is the duty of\r\n\r\na   responsible  Government  to  see  that  if  an\r\n\r\nemergency does take place there is provision  made\r\n\r\nfor  feeding the masses. Sir, the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nAyer and probably others were fortunate enough -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> To run away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> -to have had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  go  away when war broke out here in 1941.  The\r\n\r\ngeneral  population of Singapore, Sir,  could  not\r\n\r\nget  that  opportunity. I was  one  of  those  who\r\n\r\nstayed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I saw what the plight of the\r\n\r\npeople  was then. Sir, just before the  war  broke\r\n\r\nout,  I  understand, certain essential  foodstuffs\r\n\r\nwere  stockpiled  and it was this stockpile  which\r\n\r\nstood  us  in  very good stead for the  first  few\r\n\r\nmonths   when   there  was  no  organisation   yet\r\n\r\nimmediately after the Japanese occupied Singapore.\r\n\r\nDuring   this  period  of  disorganisation,   that\r\n\r\nstockpile laid by a colonial Government  stood  us\r\n\r\nin very good stead. Now, I have seen what happened\r\n\r\nafter  that. I have seen the pathetic look in  the\r\n\r\neyes of children who had to eat ubi kayu (tapioca)\r\n\r\nand who could not get sufficient rice. I have seen\r\n\r\nmiserable  men and women lying on the street  like\r\n\r\nskeletons  because they developed beri  beri  when\r\n\r\nthey  could  not  get rice. Sir,  those  who  went\r\n\r\nthrough  that  experience, I  am  sure,  will  not\r\n\r\ngrudge  but, in fact, will support that Government\r\n\r\nshould  provide  for a future emergency,  in  case\r\n\r\nthere is one, especially when the merchant is  not\r\n\r\npaying  but the consumer is paying for it and  for\r\n\r\nwhose  benefit this insurance against  the  future\r\n\r\nis.  If  they do not, Sir, and they vote for  this\r\n\r\nmotion  and if there is an emergency when supplies\r\n\r\nare cut off - this can happen, without the producing\r\n\r\ncountries  being occupied by Communist powers;  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  due to lack of shipping that our supplies\r\n\r\nmay   be  lessened - it  will  be  a  crime  against\r\n\r\nhumanity  when you find those little children  and\r\n\r\nmothers  going about with a hungry look  in  their\r\n\r\neyes.  Of course, the richer section of the public\r\n\r\nwill have stockpiles of their own in their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here an authoritative report on the\r\n\r\nsupply position and I will quote from it. I am not\r\n\r\nable   to  divulge  the  source  but  it   is   an\r\n\r\nauthoritative  report and I give  that  assurance.\r\n\r\nRegarding Burma, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was still not known what proportion of the\r\n\r\nexpected export quota of 1.6 million tons would go\r\n\r\nin  barter trade with Communist countries; but  it\r\n\r\nappeared that supplies of Burma rice coming on  to\r\n\r\nthe  free world market in 1957 would be scarce  in\r\n\r\nrelation to demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  that is without a war intervening.  So,  you\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  position where  supplies  run  short\r\n\r\nbecause some countries suddenly buy more than they\r\n\r\nhad expected. We had the case when Japan came into\r\n\r\nthe  market to buy 200,000 tons of rice early this\r\n\r\nyear. They did not buy that much, but there was  a\r\n\r\ncase  in  point.  Indonesia  might  suddenly  find\r\n\r\nherself  short  and buy a big quantity,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase, there will be a run on rice on the producing\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask hon. Members not to treat this as a\r\n\r\nParty   issue.  This  is  a  matter  of   national\r\n\r\nimportance, of importance to the people to provide\r\n\r\nfor  their future and therefore it is a matter  of\r\n\r\nimportance  to Members irrespective of which  side\r\n\r\nof  the House they sit in. If they want to provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  future of the masses, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer  said,  then  I  say  that  he  should\r\n\r\nwithdraw  his  motion or they should vote  against\r\n\r\nit.  If they think only in a short-sighted way for\r\n\r\ntoday and not care for tomorrow, it is up to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\nhappy  to  hear  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  reminding us that we  should  not  treat\r\n\r\nthis issue on a party basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lengthy speeches from both sides of\r\n\r\nthe  House,  I think the arguments fall  into  two\r\n\r\nclasses.  One,  we  look at it from  a  commercial\r\n\r\npoint  of  view, and, two, we look at  it  from  a\r\n\r\nmilitary strategy point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to talk from the commercial point of\r\n\r\nview.  The mover of the motion made it very  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  stockpile of rice policy will not  only\r\n\r\nmake the taxpayer suffer but also the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmasses.  On  this  point, I do  not  know  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Commerce  and  Industry,   as   a\r\n\r\nbuinessman, can say whether it is true or not that\r\n\r\nthe  outcry  to  abolish the stockpiling  of  rice\r\n\r\ncomes  only  from the merchants in the Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\narea  and  not  from  the public.  Not  long  ago,\r\n\r\ncertain   quarters  which  did   not   deal   with\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs   or   belonged  to  any  organisation,\r\n\r\nprinted  literature  to  reach  every  leader  and\r\n\r\nAssemblyman  seeking  his  support  to  press  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to abolish this stockpile policy.  The\r\n\r\nbasic reason is that Singapore, as we all know, is\r\n\r\nan entrepot city and there is free competition. We\r\n\r\nexperienced rice rationing during the reoccupation\r\n\r\nand  when  the price became more stable, rationing\r\n\r\nwas  abolished together with food control in  1953\r\n\r\nor  1954 - I am not sure when it came about. So  the\r\n\r\nreason  why the Government abolished food  control\r\n\r\ntwo   or  three  years  ago  was  that  Government\r\n\r\nbelieved  in  free enterprise to  bring  down  the\r\n\r\nactual  price  of  rice,  and  I  wonder  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot maintain the same confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  policy of free enterprise to bring  down  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  rice. So, from the commercial point  of\r\n\r\nview,  I  am  sure the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry, who was a businessman before, will admit\r\n\r\nthat  if the stockpile policy is dropped, the cost\r\n\r\nof  imported  rice will be reduced because  of  the\r\n\r\nmany  extra charges added. We have also heard  the\r\n\r\nserious  charge  that was made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru that a certain amount of money has  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  in order to ensure a successful  tender.\r\n\r\nThis smells of corruption. Therefore, in order  to\r\n\r\nput  this  on a more practical basis,  the  trader\r\n\r\nshould be given the chance to show that with  free\r\n\r\nenterprise in the trading of rice, there will be a\r\n\r\nreduction in price. The Minister for Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  said  the  traders refused  to  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance that a certain amount of rice  would  be\r\n\r\nstocked by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a press cutting dated 4th December, 1956.\r\n\r\nThe statement was issued by the then President  of\r\n\r\nthe  Rice Importers Association, Mr Teo Han  Sun.\r\n\r\nOn  one  item, it says that the authorities insist\r\n\r\nthat for three months'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal consumption, there has to be a reserve of at\r\n\r\nleast  25,000 tons. The Rice Importers Association\r\n\r\ndid  try many a time to give an assurance  to  the\r\n\r\nauthorities   to  that  effect.  The   Association\r\n\r\nPresident   also  pointed  out  clearly   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that the actual stock of rice  in  the\r\n\r\ngodowns  of Singapore was always more than  25,000\r\n\r\ntons   of   rice,  which  was  required   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I wonder whether or not the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce  and Industry has looked  into  this\r\n\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I want to speak from the military point\r\n\r\nof   view.   If  we  have  faith  in   our   great\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries - and we like to call  India,\r\n\r\nChina,   Thailand   and  Indonesia   our   brother\r\n\r\ncountries - why should we suspect that all these big\r\n\r\nbrothers are going to bully this small brother? So\r\n\r\nthe  whole thing rests on the tradition  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  our  external defence  and  external\r\n\r\nrelations  still lies in the hands of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom Government. This is the atomic age and yet\r\n\r\nwe  base our strategy on the fact that this island\r\n\r\nmust  have a certain amount rice stocked  for  the\r\n\r\npeople: how many infantries are required to defend\r\n\r\nthis island; how many battleships to guard our sea-coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is the right time for the\r\n\r\nelected   Government   to  make   this   important\r\n\r\npoint - that   in  this  atomic  age  the   military\r\n\r\nstrategy of the United Kingdom is not to think  in\r\n\r\nterms of submarines, battleships or even an atomic\r\n\r\nbomb, but the feelings of the local people. If the\r\n\r\nlocal   people   support  the   United   Kingdom's\r\n\r\nstrategy, then I think that even a stock of  three\r\n\r\nmonths' foodstuffs is not sufficient to carry  on.\r\n\r\nBut  the  local people do not share that point  of\r\n\r\nview.  We  must take this opportunity to show  our\r\n\r\nAsian-African spirit, that we have  faith  in  our\r\n\r\nAsian  and  African brothers who, for years,  have\r\n\r\nsuffered under imperialistic rule. War could  only\r\n\r\npossibly  come  from  this  side  because  it   is\r\n\r\nsuspected  that  we have been influenced  or  have\r\n\r\nbeen  infiltrated  by  the  Communist  forces  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  there is a possibility of war  breaking\r\n\r\nout  at any moment, as has been pointed out by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry. But I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the local people, especially the man in  the\r\n\r\nstreet, can understand this, and I wish to ask our\r\n\r\nintelligent   leaders  in  this  House   why   the\r\n\r\nAmericans,  in  recent years,  have  rapidly  lost\r\n\r\npopularity  among our Asian nations. Why?  Because\r\n\r\nthe  Americans  talk of war the  whole  time,  war\r\n\r\neverywhere and military bases everywhere. How much\r\n\r\nsupport do they think they can seek from the Asian\r\n\r\nand  African  people? Sir, so from this  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  why  has the Government not the courage  to\r\n\r\ntell  Whitehall?  \"The people  of  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nfaith  in their own destiny. We do not think there\r\n\r\nis  going to be any war now at all. We believe  in\r\n\r\npeace  and co-existence.\" If we can get away  from\r\n\r\nthe  influence of the United Kingdom, I think  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of stockpiling will be much  easier  for\r\n\r\nthe Government to think of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after saying all this, I must say that I am\r\n\r\nin  no  way  opposed  to this  motion,  but  I  do\r\n\r\nsincerely suggest to Government that (1) it should\r\n\r\nabolish  the stockpile policy, and (2)  it  should\r\n\r\nseek  an assurance from the rice importers whether\r\n\r\nit  is  true  that  they can  satisfy  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  strategists' demands, and  (3) ,  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  drop its plans for the time being and  see\r\n\r\nwhether  the  price  of  rice  will  increase   or\r\n\r\ndecrease. This will prove to the people  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  sincere in  its  concern  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the people. Sir, I wish to repeat again\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Minister for Commerce and Industry  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  that  this issue must not be treated  as  a\r\n\r\nparty  issue  but  as  a  national  issue  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Masses. So I take this\r\n\r\nopportunity, not as a champion of the  masses,  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what the masses really think, and that  is\r\n\r\nthat  during the Japanese occupation,  they  could\r\n\r\npurchase  rice  at eight cents per katty  although\r\n\r\nstocks  were  insufficient  and  the  simpleminded\r\n\r\ncitizens  cannot understand why they have  to  pay\r\n\r\nmuch  more now when we have assured them that this\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  far  better  than  the   Japanese\r\n\r\nmilitary  government.  So,  Sir,  Government  must\r\n\r\ncarefully consider this issue which is a  national\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  concerned over the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  whether the people will be able  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir rice the next day and whether they are going\r\n\r\nto  pay a cent less or a cent more. In fact,  that\r\n\r\nis most commendable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> However, the method of\r\n\r\napproach seems to me that one set of people  think\r\n\r\nabout  it  in the form of a Government  guarantee.\r\n\r\nOther  people  think  that  we  can  provide  that\r\n\r\nguarantee without Government's interference.  Now,\r\n\r\nlet  us see. We have been having our stockpile for\r\n\r\na  long  time.  Let us see what  are  the  reasons\r\n\r\nbehind it. The first reason is that if there is  a\r\n\r\nwar  or an emergency, then where are we to get our\r\n\r\nrice  from?  The second reason for stockpiling  is\r\n\r\nthat if there is black-marketing in rice, then  we\r\n\r\nmust  stop  the  merchants  from  exploiting  that\r\n\r\nsituation.   Of  course,  the  third  reason   for\r\n\r\nstockpiling  may be similar to the stockpiling  of\r\n\r\nrubber in America which is needed as a sort  of  a\r\n\r\r\nbuffer.  If the price should rise, then they  push\r\n\r\nout  a  little bit of the rubber to put the  price\r\n\r\ndown,  and so on. It will keep down prices at  the\r\n\r\ncorrect level to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I certainly feel that the third reason is\r\n\r\nout  because  Government has never tried  to  keep\r\n\r\nprices down in favour of the people but allows the\r\n\r\nprice to go up or down as the market dictates.  So\r\n\r\nthat reason is out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the second one about the control of\r\n\r\nrice,  probably stockpiling and rice control  will\r\n\r\nbe  necessary during the war years when there will\r\n\r\nbe  a  shortage of supply. According to the  usual\r\n\r\nlaws  of supply and demand, prices will go up when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  shortage of rice. Price control  and\r\n\r\ndistribution  become  necessary  during  emergency\r\n\r\nyears.  But the balance has already swung over  to\r\n\r\nthe other side and today we find that there is  no\r\n\r\nshortage  of  supply. In fact, supply  is  greater\r\n\r\nthan demand. I have never heard of China exporting\r\n\r\nrice before but today she seems to be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport  rice to Ceylon. Thailand, after  the  war,\r\n\r\nwas still short of rice but today, she seems to be\r\n\r\noffering  rice to everybody and so is Burma  which\r\n\r\nis  trying to offer her surplus stock. Ceylon  too\r\n\r\nis trying to trade with other countries and trying\r\n\r\nto barter her rice for something else. Now we have\r\n\r\nplenty  of  rice  all around and because  of  this\r\n\r\nsituation, the price of rice in a free market must\r\n\r\nnecessarily come down. Here is where price control\r\n\r\ncan  stop, and the usual way of supply and  demand\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to  work  for the  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. Of course, if there is a further glut, you\r\n\r\nwill  find that the merchants are willing to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  goods  even  below cost.  That  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater advantage to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to the first reason which\r\n\r\nis  said to be the most important, and that is, we\r\n\r\nmust  have  a stock to tide us over any emergency.\r\n\r\nWe  agree  with  that. I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment how Hongkong manages this. They have  a\r\n\r\nstockpile but I think the merchants are  giving  a\r\n\r\nhelping  hand  there. In Singapore, I  have  heard\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister for Commerce and Industry state\r\n\r\nthat  a few years ago, the traders were approached\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  about the question  of  being\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  a stockpile  of  rice  and  they\r\n\r\nrefused  to  undertake this task. Sir,  ideas  can\r\n\r\nchange. We know that the Government has changed  a\r\n\r\nlot of its ideas and plans all along and merchants\r\n\r\nalso  are  privileged in the same  way  to  change\r\n\r\ntheir plans. During the last few days, I have been\r\n\r\naround in the market to find out the position, and\r\n\r\nI  was  pleasantly surprised to find that quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of merchants were willing to carry stocks.\r\n\r\nThis  question can certainly be investigated into,\r\n\r\nand  if  they  are willing to carry  stocks,  then\r\n\r\nstockpiling   may   be  done  by   the   merchants\r\n\r\nthemselves. Perhaps, in order to help the  public,\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  still extend the  same  offer  of\r\n\r\ncapital  and godown space for the stockpiling  and\r\n\r\nkeep  a check on the actual amount of rice in  the\r\n\r\ngodowns.  If that can be done, it will save  us  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  trouble. But, of course, when  Government\r\n\r\nthinks about giving anybody any responsibility,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit   must   also  think  of  giving   them   some\r\n\r\nprivileges,  because privilege and responsibility\r\n\r\nalways go together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> To put a flag on a car!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, there must always be\r\n\r\nresponsibility with privilege and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Sometime last month\r\n\r\nwhen  I referred to the \"masses\", I was criticised\r\n\r\nfor being preoccupied with the lumpen proletariat.\r\n\r\nBut now, I have respectable company in the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"masses\" in the Member for Telok  Ayer,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tiong Bahru,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry, the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nand  the  Member for Changi. We get more and  more\r\n\r\nrespectable as we go along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two facets to this problem of the\r\n\r\nstockpile.  I promised the Member for  Telok  Aver\r\n\r\nthat  I would keep an open mind till I have  heard\r\n\r\nboth sides and, like a good judge, I have tried to\r\n\r\nkeep an open mind although my colleague the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Ponggol-Tampenis  (Mr  Goh  Chew  Chua)  had\r\n\r\nalready  more or less decided what should  be  the\r\n\r\nright  stand. On the one side is the  question  of\r\n\r\nthe efficient running of the stockpile. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tiong  Bahru (Mr William Tan) has  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe mysterious figure of $4,000 paid by importers.\r\n\r\nAnd  another Liberal-Socialist Member has lectured\r\n\r\nabout  how middlemen can make profits on even  one\r\n\r\ngraphite  pencil.  If anyone  seeks  the  road  to\r\n\r\npersonal happiness and prosperity, well, join this\r\n\r\nParty.  We  have  been told that  the  middleman's\r\n\r\nprofit   is   a   wicked  thing   and   from   the\r\n\r\ndistinguished merchant, the Member for Telok Ayer.\r\n\r\nHe says. \"It is a wicked thing. We must get rid of\r\n\r\nthe  middlemen.\" And I was wondering at that  time\r\n\r\nwhether  he had already left the Liberal-Socialist\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the astonishing suggestion that if rice\r\n\r\nwere  freed, meaning not that controls are removed\r\n\r\nbut that stockpiles are abolished, its price would\r\n\r\nstabilise itself automatically. I am not sure what\r\n\r\nit  means.  All I know is that no price is  static\r\n\r\nunless it is controlled. It will move up and  down\r\n\r\naccording to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupply and demand.

Sir, if we are convinced of\r\n\r\nthat,  then,  of course the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member for Telok Ayer has congratulated\r\n\r\nfor  representing  the people will  vote  for  his\r\n\r\nmotion.  Unfortunately, I am in some doubt whether\r\n\r\nif the stockpile were removed, it would be not the\r\n\r\nmasses who would benefit but the merchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Of Telok Ayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We were told that the\r\n\r\nstockpile was needed for the contingency of a  war\r\n\r\nor an emergency.

Singapore  may  import  the  rice  and\r\n\r\nforward it to the Federation, but in fact this  is\r\n\r\nnot  re-export in the real sense of  the  term.  I\r\n\r\nmean, we used to re-export big quantities in those\r\n\r\ndays  to  Ceylon, India and Africa and  not  small\r\n\r\nquantities like five tons to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has not made any point at all to\r\n\r\ndefend its policy of a strategic stockpile for  an\r\n\r\nemergency. I say that there is no emergency or the\r\n\r\nthreat  of war in this part of South-East Asia.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Minister also  mentioned  about  the\r\n\r\nJapanese attack. Yes, those days have now  passed.\r\n\r\nWhom  do  we fear now in South-East Asia?  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can prove that there will  be  a  real\r\n\r\nemergency  or  an attack, well, that  is  quite  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter but the Government has not proved\r\n\r\nit  at  all.  We  were only told  of  sad  stories\r\n\r\nhappening   during  the  Japanese  occupation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  We  know all that. That is  nothing  new.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to ask is whom are we afraid of now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be very interesting to know what is the\r\n\r\ntotal  tonnage in the stockpile and  what  is  the\r\n\r\ntotal  tonnage sold to dealers? The Minister  made\r\n\r\nreference  to  the honesty of the rice  merchants!\r\n\r\nOnly  recently, he was a merchant and he  can  ask\r\n\r\nhimself that question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prices will always adjust according to\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand. On the other hand,  the  rice\r\n\r\ndealers are willing to have a minimum quantity  of\r\n\r\nstockpile, not in Government godowns but in  their\r\n\r\nown  godowns  which can be checked  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime. A solution can be arrived at very easily, if\r\n\r\nit is found that they can manage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much was said about the cost of half a cent or\r\n\r\none cent more to the consumer. May I point out  to\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party that if a family of ten\r\n\r\npays  half a cent or one cent more for a katty  of\r\n\r\nrice,  how much would it cost them monthly? Is  it\r\n\r\nnot in the interest of the masses that they should\r\n\r\npay less?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point was also made that it is not the\r\n\r\nmerchant who suffers but it is the consumer. May I\r\n\r\nask  why  should the consumer suffer at  all?  The\r\n\r\nconsumer  should  not  suffer  because   of   this\r\n\r\nstockpile or control of the rice trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also told that there is no control of rice\r\n\r\nimports.  What else can you call it  if  a  person\r\n\r\nwants  to import rice which he can import, but  he\r\n\r\nhas  also to buy rice from the Government  in  the\r\n\r\nratio of one to two? If this is not control,  then\r\n\r\nwhat do you name it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point was made that by stockpiling, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not  incurring  expenses  for  the\r\n\r\nrunning of the department, it works out like this:\r\n\r\ntaking from one pocket and putting it into another\r\n\r\npocket.  It comes to the same thing. My  point  is\r\n\r\nthis.  Whether  you charge it to  revenue  or  you\r\n\r\nsuffer a loss or you charge the merchant extra for\r\n\r\ntaking  your tonnage of rice in proportion to  his\r\n\r\nimports, ultimately the consumer pays.

Of  this  $2\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  capital, $1\u00bd million is owned  by  the\r\n\r\nStraits Steamship Company Limited, about $500,000\r\n\r\nis  owned  by some shipping company in  Liverpool\r\n\r\nand the rest by Mansfield and Company Limited and\r\n\r\na  few  other private individuals. From  a  share\r\n\r\ncapital  of  $2\u00bd million, the  company's  books\r\n\r\ntoday show that it is worth $7\u00bc million. In the\r\n\r\nmeantime, the company has been paying profits  at\r\n\r\napproximately three per cent per annum. The union\r\n\r\nhas  been able to obtain accurate figures of what\r\n\r\nthe  company considers its capital to  be  worth,\r\n\r\nand these figures have not so far been challenged\r\n\r\nby the company. But the union says that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a great undervaluation of the assets; that,\r\n\r\nin   fact,  the  accumulated  profits  plus   the\r\n\r\noriginal  capital amount to much more than  $7\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.  For instance, the union says  that  the\r\n\r\naircraft\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- eleven Dakotas - are now book-valued at $81,000 and\r\n\r\nby  the end of the franchise, each Dakota would be\r\n\r\nvalued  at $1, whilst motor-vehicles owned by  the\r\n\r\nCompany  are  valued at $184,000. If one  were  to\r\n\r\nlook  purely  at the accounts of the company,  one\r\n\r\nmight  be  led  to the conclusion  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntransport   company,  not  an  airline.   However,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the union, who are in a  position  to\r\n\r\nknow  the  price of Dakotas say that  each  Dakota\r\n\r\nwould  cost somewhere around $300,000, not $8,000.\r\n\r\nLet  us assume that it is not as high as the union\r\n\r\npitches  it  but that it is somewhere  around  say\r\n\r\n$100,000. Even at that figure, the company is  now\r\n\r\nworth  about  $10 million from a capital  of  2\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.  In  the years 1951 to 1956, the  company\r\n\r\npaid  the  following  dividends:  1951,  $105,000;\r\n\r\n1952, $140,000; 1953, $140,000; 1954, $52,500;\r\n\r\n1955,  $70,000 and 1956, $175,000 and  these  were\r\n\r\nout  of profits made from 1951 to 1956 as follows:\r\n\r\n1951,    $1,128,000;   1952,   $l,823,000;   1953,\r\n\r\n$1,318,000;  1954,  $201,000; 1955,  $345,000  and\r\n\r\n1956,  $1,407,000. Now, Sir, it may be claimed  by\r\n\r\nthe  company  that they risked their capital - their\r\n\r\n$2\u00bd million - to make these profits  and,  having\r\n\r\npaid  their  workers the wages they contracted  to\r\n\r\npay   them,  a  bonus  is  therefore  out  of  the\r\n\r\nquestion.  The union's claim is that  the  company\r\n\r\nshould  pay them one month's salary for each  year\r\n\r\nof  service; they have helped to make the  company\r\n\r\nthese profits; without them, the company's capital\r\n\r\nwould not have produced these profits. In the boom\r\n\r\nyears  of  1951 to 1953, when the union approached\r\n\r\nthe  management for bonuses - and bonuses were given\r\n\r\nby  all good employers then who were cashing in on\r\n\r\nthe   boom - the  company's  reply  was  that  these\r\n\r\nprofits  were  being accumulated to  purchase  new\r\n\r\naircraft  so  that, at the end of  the  franchise,\r\n\r\nthere   will   be  better  aircraft  and   further\r\n\r\nemployment  provided for union  members.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  sister  companies of Malayan Airways,  like\r\n\r\nMansfield  and  Straits  Steamship,  were   paying\r\n\r\nbonuses. Malayan Airways was the one company  that\r\n\r\nnever paid any bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July 1956 it was announced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the major shareholders of the company  would\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  retain their shareholdings  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and  were selling out. It  was  announced\r\n\r\nalso  that  the  management of the airline  would,\r\n\r\nalthough still in the name of Malayan Airways, be,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  vested in B.O.A.C. The union approached\r\n\r\nthe  Managing Director of the Company in September\r\n\r\nlast  year,  on two occasions, the  12th  and  the\r\n\r\n27th,  and  asked  the  management  if  they  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  consider the payment of  a  goodwill\r\n\r\nremuneration  to  the  employees  for  their  past\r\n\r\nservices  to  the  company. The Managing  Director\r\n\r\nthen  replied  that  he was  not  opposed  to  the\r\n\r\npayment  and went as far as to discuss the various\r\n\r\nways  and means of distributing payment. He agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the union should put in a formal claim.  The\r\n\r\nunion  did  this on 17th October. Later the  union\r\n\r\nnotified  the company that if the company insisted\r\n\r\non  refusing  to  consider the  payment  of  their\r\n\r\nclaim,  the  union would have to  consider  taking\r\n\r\naction.  There  was  a final meeting  between  the\r\n\r\nunion  and the company on 18th December. The union\r\n\r\nasked  for  an assurance from the Management  that\r\n\r\nconsideration would be given to share with the men\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the franchise a  part  of  these\r\n\r\naccumulated  profits, which  are  hidden  away  in\r\n\r\nwritten-off assets. Four Directors of the  company\r\n\r\nwere  present. They were evasive and they  refused\r\n\r\nto  give  any assurance whatsoever. All they  were\r\n\r\nprepared to say was that if, at some time  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  they were in a position to make any  such\r\n\r\nstatement,  they  would,  but  it  depended   upon\r\n\r\nwhether  they would be getting this new franchise,\r\n\r\nwhether  they would be getting a good  price  from\r\n\r\nB.O.A.C., and oh so many other factors. The  union\r\n\r\nand its members were not prepared to wait for some\r\n\r\nindefinite  reply at some indefinite future  date.\r\n\r\nAs the franchise was running out, they took strike\r\n\r\naction. They decided to take strike action on  the\r\n\r\n20th and took strike action on the 23rd and 24th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what does all this come to? It is a\r\n\r\nfight against an employer who has, showing on  his\r\n\r\nbooks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccumulated reserves out of profits of  $2,850,000\r\n\r\nin   cash.  They  said  it  was  to  purchase  new\r\n\r\naircraft.  They  have other assets which  together\r\n\r\nwith  this  $2,850,000  total,  according  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany,  $7\u00bd  million  but,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nunion,  at  least  $10 million.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nhaving  paid approximately three per cent dividend\r\n\r\nevery year, it has quadrupled its capital and  now\r\n\r\nproposes   to   sell  out,  i.e. those   of   the\r\n\r\nshareholders who want to sell out, to B.O.A.C. or\r\n\r\nsuch  other purchasers as the Government may  come\r\n\r\nto terms with for a new franchise. The union says,\r\n\r\n\"Give  us  one  month's  pay  for  every  year  of\r\n\r\nservice.\"   This  would  amount,   including   all\r\n\r\nexpatriate  staff, to $1\u00bc million, approximately\r\n\r\n15  per cent of the accumulated profits - hidden and\r\n\r\nshown profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Malayan Airways were an ordinary\r\n\r\ncommercial  company,  this  might  be  termed   an\r\n\r\nunusual claim; although in certain countries  like\r\n\r\nJapan,  at the end of every year, unions negotiate\r\n\r\nwith  employers for bonus payments on the  showing\r\n\r\nof the past year's transactions. But there are two\r\n\r\nfeatures  which  make Malayan  Airways  a  special\r\n\r\ncase.   First,   it  operates  on   a   Government\r\n\r\nmonopoly - a  franchise.  No  person  can  open   an\r\n\r\nairline  to  compete with it, and the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  (Mr Marshall) will know how,  when  he\r\n\r\nurged on behalf of Nanyang Airways the opening  of\r\n\r\nanother competitive airline, it met with strenuous\r\n\r\nobjection  from  Malayan Airways Limited;  and  no\r\n\r\ncompetition  was  allowed. Second,  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister will remember that when he asked  a\r\n\r\nquestion in the Legislative Council then in  March\r\n\r\n1954,   he  was  informed  by  the  then  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary   that  the  Government  had  subsidised\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways to the tune of $850,000. These are\r\n\r\ntwo  extraordinary  features  which  take  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  out  of  the  ordinary  run  of  European\r\n\r\nconcerns in this country. First, it operates on  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  franchise - a monopoly; second,  it  has\r\n\r\nreceived  subsidies from the Government.  If  this\r\n\r\nHouse  has  the right to discuss the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhether subsidies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  paid to this company, to  maintain  an\r\n\r\ninternal  airline,  I submit this  House  has  the\r\n\r\nright, to urge this company to share 15 per  cent\r\n\r\nof its accumulated profits showing in the books of\r\n\r\nthe  company,  with  its local  employees - $7\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first half of my motion may, to\r\n\r\northodox Socialists, sound very conservative. In a\r\n\r\nmild motion, I urge,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House supports the principle of profit-sharing between employer and employee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  more politically literate countries, employers\r\n\r\nhave discovered that if they want to preserve  the\r\n\r\nfree enterprise system, they had better offer  the\r\n\r\nworkers a greater share of the profits, and profit-sharing  is,  in fact - and I repeat  this  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of my Liberal-Socialists who sit on  this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House - a principle advocated  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Conservative Party in order  to  preserve\r\n\r\nBritish  Conservative  Party  members'  interests.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing revolutionary in this principle.\r\n\r\nIt is just a method by which you keep your workers\r\n\r\ncontented.  Those in favour of violent revolution,\r\n\r\nof  course, oppose this policy. It is a retrograde\r\n\r\nstep  because  it  tends to make the  workers  get\r\n\r\ninvolved with the interests of the management. For\r\n\r\ninstance, if you get a \"good\" employer like  Henry\r\n\r\nFord who gives you shares in the company you begin\r\n\r\nto  have  an  interest in the profits the  company\r\n\r\nmakes,  and the class conflict weakens.  You  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  fighting  the employer but  you  will  be\r\n\r\nworking  harder to make profits for  the  employer\r\n\r\nand  for  yourself. So, it will be interesting  to\r\n\r\nknow whether our local Conservative Party, namely,\r\n\r\nthe Liberal-Socialists, support this principle, as\r\n\r\nI  am  urging them to do. If they do that, I would\r\n\r\nlike to know further whether, as a logical outcome\r\n\r\nof  that, they would urge Malayan Airways - I am not\r\n\r\nsaying we are compelling Malayan Airways; all I am\r\n\r\nasking  is an opinion, the opinion of the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people  of  Singapore - that\r\n\r\nthey consider that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15  per cent of the accumulated net profits of the\r\n\r\ncompany should be shared with the workers  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of the 10-year franchise. That, in brief,  is\r\n\r\nthe issue. The union are still on strike and they,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion, have made a morally just claim. It\r\n\r\nmay  not  be a claim that one can enforce  in  any\r\n\r\ncourt  of  law,  but it is a fair  and  reasonable\r\n\r\nclaim.  The company has made these profits out  of\r\n\r\ntheir labour and has never paid any bonus for  the\r\n\r\npast  ten  years  on the grounds that  they  were\r\n\r\naccumulating  these profits to buy  new  aircraft.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,   every  year,   when   the   company\r\n\r\ncomplimented its workers by a notice on the notice-board,  it  drew attention to the  fact  that  all\r\n\r\nthese profits that they were making were, in fact,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  the  happiness and employment  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees because the company could then carry  on\r\n\r\nwith new aircraft. Sir, the management, I am told,\r\n\r\nis  alarmed at the principle, not because, in this\r\n\r\nparticular  case,  it  is  an  unjust  claim,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Directors of the  company  are  also\r\n\r\nDirectors of other sister companies connected with\r\n\r\nMalayan   Airways,  such  as  Straits   Steamship,\r\n\r\nMansfield, and so on. But unlike Straits Steamship\r\n\r\nand  Mansfield, Malayan Airways is  in  a  special\r\n\r\nposition  with  regard to this  Assembly.  If  any\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist is frightened  of  keeping  away\r\n\r\nforeign capital, may I remind them of this: we are\r\n\r\nconcerned here with British capital employed on  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  monopoly, in which the Government  had\r\n\r\nthought fit to subsidise by the year 1954 the  sum\r\n\r\nof  $850,000. If we could do that surely we can do\r\n\r\nmore for its workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, this particular dispute spotlights a\r\n\r\nmuch  wider issue - namely, that after the  transfer\r\n\r\nof  political  independence from  the  British  to\r\n\r\nMalayans,  will  come  the  question  of  economic\r\n\r\nindependence.  I would not like today  to  discuss\r\n\r\ngenerally  the  question of foreign investment  in\r\n\r\nMalaya,  but  I would ask this House  to  make  it\r\n\r\nquite clear that if foreign capital comes to  this\r\n\r\ncountry  to  operate  Government  monopolies   and\r\n\r\nexpect  security  not  only of  capital  but  also\r\n\r\nagainst losses, and are paid subsidies by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government against losses, then  it  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared   to   adopt  a  liberal   profit-sharing\r\n\r\nattitude towards its workers. I urge the House  to\r\n\r\nsupport my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsecond  the  motion. Malayan Airways  Limited  was\r\n\r\nformed  in  1947 with a paid-up share  capital  of\r\n\r\n$2\u00bd   million  and  a  10-year  franchise.   The\r\n\r\nfranchise   ends   this   year   and   the   major\r\n\r\nshareholders,  Mansfield and Company  Limited  and\r\n\r\nStraits  Steamship, are selling out  their  shares\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  the B.O.A.C. On the company's  own\r\n\r\nfigures,  Malayan  Airways started  with  a  share\r\n\r\ncapital  of  $2\u00bd million and had on  April  1954\r\n\r\nassets valued by the company at $7,300,000.  Among\r\n\r\nthe  assets  included in the  $7,300,000  are  the\r\n\r\neleven  Dakotas of the company valued at  $81,512,\r\n\r\nthat  is  about $7,500 for each Dakota  plane.  In\r\n\r\nspite of this absurd undervaluation of its assets,\r\n\r\nthe  company's  figures show an  increase  from  a\r\n\r\nshare  capital of $2\u00bd million to over $7 million\r\n\r\nworth of assets. The net profits earned by Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways over the six-year period from 1951 to 1956\r\n\r\nalone amounts to over $6 million. Other commercial\r\n\r\nfirms also made large profits over this period but\r\n\r\nmany  of them paid bonuses to their employees.  It\r\n\r\nis  well known, Sir, that employees in the  rubber\r\n\r\nindustry were paid large bonuses in 1951 and 1952,\r\n\r\nespecially  by  local  employers,  but  when   the\r\n\r\nemployees approached Malayan Airways in  the  boom\r\n\r\nyears  for a bonus, their employer, while agreeing\r\n\r\nthat  the workers should get a bonus, claimed that\r\n\r\nthey  were setting aside the profits for  reserves\r\n\r\nto  buy  new  aircraft and equipment. The  workers\r\n\r\naccepted  this  explanation and have  received  no\r\n\r\nbonus whatsoever from the beginning of the company\r\n\r\ntill now. The company has not, in fact, bought any\r\n\r\nnew  aircraft.  The accumulated  net  profits  are\r\n\r\nstill  there for reserve and now that the  company\r\n\r\nis selling out, the workers feel quite justly that\r\n\r\na  small  proportion of these  profits,  which  in\r\n\r\nother commercial firms would have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  the workers and  which  were  put\r\n\r\naside  by the Malayan Airways for reserve,  should\r\n\r\nbe  paid  to them. The workers helped to make  the\r\n\r\nprofits. This principle of sharing a part  of  the\r\n\r\nprofits is recognised in all good local commercial\r\n\r\nfirms. A bonus of one month's salary, Sir, for one\r\n\r\nyear  is nothing exceptional in commercial  firms.\r\n\r\nIn  the case of Malayan Airways, no bonus was paid\r\n\r\nto  the  workers on the pretext that  the  company\r\n\r\nwould  have  to purchase expensive aircraft  which\r\n\r\nwere never, in fact, bought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the franchise is coming to an end, to\r\n\r\ngive 15 per cent of the accumulated profits to the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  made the profit for the  company  is\r\n\r\nonly fair and reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House is divided into two parts.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  in regard to the principle  of  profit-sharing  between employer and employees;  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond part is in connection with the claim of the\r\n\r\nlocal employees of the Malayan Airways Limited who\r\n\r\nare now out on strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to the first part of the motion,\r\n\r\nthe  principle of profit-sharing between  employer\r\n\r\nand  employees, it has been said by the  mover  of\r\n\r\nthe motion that it was a Conservative Party device\r\n\r\nto   retain  workers  to  remain  loyal  to  their\r\n\r\nemployers.  Sir,  it  is the view  of  many  trade\r\n\r\nunionists that the most important aim is to secure\r\n\r\nadequate  regular  wages  and  salaries  for   all\r\n\r\nworkers.  According to their view,  profit-sharing\r\n\r\nand  bonuses  after  the requirement  of  adequate\r\n\r\nwages  has  been  met,  are  really  matters   for\r\n\r\nemployers  to  decide.  If they  choose  to  offer\r\n\r\nbonuses as additional inducement to their workers,\r\n\r\neveryone will applaud it, though some shareholders\r\n\r\nmay  have  reservations.  Sir,  the  position   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   with  regard  to  profit-sharing   and\r\n\r\nbonuses  is  undoubtedly  complicated  by  Chinese\r\n\r\ncustom. The Chinese New Year bonus has become,  in\r\n\r\nChinese  firms  and  also  in  many  other  firms,\r\n\r\nhallowed by tradition, and it is because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this  tradition,  and  only  because  of  this\r\n\r\ntradition,  that  the Government  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsupport the first part of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part, Sir, which\r\n\r\nrefers to the claim of the local employees of  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways  Limited, since  my  return  from\r\n\r\nLondon only a fortnight ago, I have endeavoured to\r\n\r\nbring about a settlement of the strike. I have met\r\n\r\nthe  employers  five or six times, and  the  union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  Sir,  also  about  five  or  six\r\n\r\ntimes, but in spite of all my efforts, I feel that\r\n\r\nI  have to say in this Assembly that I do not  see\r\n\r\nany possibility of a settlement. My frank view  is\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir, if the workers will return to work,  I\r\n\r\nwill give an assurance that the Government will do\r\n\r\neverything possible to secure for them a  suitable\r\n\r\ntoken  payment by the employer at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nfranchise period. I feel, Sir, that if they  would\r\n\r\ngo back, it would strengthen my hand in my further\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with the employer. I would  therefore\r\n\r\nurge  the  hon. mover of the motion to advise  the\r\n\r\nunion that it is in their best interests to return\r\n\r\nto  work  immediately  on my  assurance  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will do everything possible  to  secure\r\n\r\nfor  their members a suitable token payment at the\r\n\r\nend of the franchise period. I have, Sir, a letter\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will  be sending to the  union  to  this\r\n\r\neffect,  and I repeat again, Sir, I hope the  hon.\r\n\r\nmover   of  the  motion  will  advise  the   union\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of what I have said, Sir, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can only support  the  first\r\n\r\npart  of the motion and cannot support the  second\r\n\r\npart for the simple reason that there is a dispute\r\n\r\non.  I am not saying anything about the merits  or\r\n\r\nthe  demerits  of  the strike in order  to  pacify\r\n\r\nfeelings on either side. I feel, Sir, there  is  a\r\n\r\nsolution  to  this strike, and  that  is  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  listen to my plea  that  they  should\r\n\r\nreturn  to work in their own interests and in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore beg to move an amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words after the word\r\n\r\n\"employees\" appearing in the second line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

This   was   in\r\n\r\nrecognition of the services they have rendered and\r\n\r\nwould  have  rendered had they stayed on.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of the Malayan Airways Local Employees Union,\r\n\r\nthe  sum  involved is, compared with the abolition\r\n\r\nbounty, a mere flea-bite; but I wonder how many of\r\n\r\nthose  who  voted  for  the spectacular  abolition\r\n\r\nbonus would have trembled at the thought of having\r\n\r\ngiven  a  mere million as goodwill bonus to  local\r\n\r\nemployees.  We  shall no doubt be  told  that  the\r\n\r\ndemand  of  the workers for a small share  in  the\r\n\r\nprofits   the   Malayan   Airways   Limited    has\r\n\r\naccumulated   during  the  last   six   years   is\r\n\r\nunreasonable  and  not  in  accordance  with   the\r\n\r\ncommercial  practice. But is  the  demand  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways workers unreasonable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the facts. Malayan Airways is a\r\n\r\nprivate   limited  company.  It  has  had  virtual\r\n\r\nmonopoly  of air transportation in Malaya.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot surprising that this lucrative monopoly should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  handed over to the British  controlled\r\n\r\nfirms  like  the Straits Steamship Company  (which\r\n\r\nholds   $1,500,000  of  the  issued   capital   of\r\n\r\n$2,500,000),  the  Ocean  Steamship   Company   of\r\n\r\nLiverpool (which holds $545,000 worth of  shares),\r\n\r\nand  B.O.A.C.  (which holds about  $545,000).  The\r\n\r\nrest  is held by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking\r\n\r\nCorporation and a few private individuals. Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  is a big British business and the  former\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government was very conscious  of  this.\r\n\r\nBetween 1947 and 1953 the Government helped  these\r\n\r\nprivate firms with considerable subsidies.  I  beg\r\n\r\nto  quote  from  the hon. mover  of  the  original\r\n\r\nmotion  that  the  present Chief  Minister  should\r\n\r\nrecollect  the  answer given to  him  in  the  old\r\n\r\nLegislative Council by the then Colonial Secretary\r\n\r\nin March 1954. This is what the Colonial Secretary\r\n\r\nthen said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Between 1947 and 1953 Government subsidy to\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways amounted to over $850,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was  presumably  goodwill  payment  to   the\r\n\r\nshareholders  of  Malayan Airways.  That  was  all\r\n\r\nright  by the Government. That was sound business.\r\n\r\nThat  was all right because of the services  which\r\n\r\nthe  shareholders were rendering in this  country.\r\n\r\nLet  us not, however, be misled into thinking that\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways  was  living  a  hand  to   mouth\r\n\r\nexistence. Between 1951 and 1956 the net profit of\r\n\r\nthe  company totalled about $6 million;  but  even\r\n\r\nmore  important is this: this Company, which began\r\n\r\nwith  a share capital of only $2,500,000, has,  on\r\n\r\nthe   basis  of  its  old  conservative  estimate,\r\n\r\nexceeded  three  times the value of  its  original\r\n\r\nshare  capital.  It  is  a debatable  point,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhether  the shareholders of the Straits Steamship\r\n\r\nCompany, the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool,\r\n\r\nand  the shareholders of the Hongkong and Shanghai\r\n\r\nBanking Corporation contributed anything by way of\r\n\r\nlabour  and skill to treble the assets of  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways.  But  what  cannot  be  doubted  are  the\r\n\r\ndecisive  contributions made by the  employees  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways towards increasing the assets  of\r\n\r\nthe  company; and what is not in doubt also is the\r\n\r\nfact that Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirways has made profits which during the last six\r\n\r\nyears it never once shared with its employees.  At\r\n\r\nleast many other private firms in the colony  have\r\n\r\nshared their good fortune with their employees  by\r\n\r\nway  of  a yearly bonus; but not Malayan Airways - a\r\n\r\nprivate  company  enjoying not only  the  monopoly\r\n\r\nprotection from the Government but even subsidies.\r\n\r\nBut   now   the  company  is  to  sell   out   its\r\n\r\nshareholdings at its present enhanced  value.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  are  naturally resentful  that  only  the\r\n\r\nshareholders  of the Straits Steamship  and  their\r\n\r\nfriends should share out among themselves  the  $3\r\n\r\nthey  would  get  for every dollar they  invested,\r\n\r\nthis in addition to the dividends they have got so\r\n\r\nfar.  In  other  words, Sir,  not  only  will  the\r\n\r\nshareholders get back their $2,500,000 capital and\r\n\r\nenjoy  dividends during the last  six  years,  but\r\n\r\nthey will, when they sell out, have a million more\r\n\r\nas  profit  from  the sale. All that  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways employees are asking is that a small  part\r\n\r\nof  this  profit from the sale should be  siphoned\r\n\r\noff  to them. After all, it was their efforts  and\r\n\r\nskill  and  not  those of the  shareholders  which\r\n\r\nincreased the value of the company. All  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are asking, Sir, is for a small share  of\r\n\r\nwhat  would  have got into one of the small  side-pockets of the British capitalist company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I did not wish unduly  to  give\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  criticism that, on an occasion  like\r\n\r\nthis,  I took the opportunity to slosh up European\r\n\r\ncapital  in  general.

But we would like to remind\r\n\r\nEuropean  capital,  particularly  those  companies\r\n\r\ndependent  on government monopolies and  goodwill,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Singapore Traction Company  and  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways Limited, that if its purpose is to\r\n\r\nmake profits on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe basis that it had been making in prewar years,\r\n\r\nthen it will come to a sorry end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which European capital\r\n\r\ncomes to an end in Asia. One, as in India where it\r\n\r\ntook  in Indian capital with it and gradually went\r\n\r\ninto  partnership with Indian capital; and with  a\r\n\r\nbenevolent government, no exploitation  of  Indian\r\n\r\nworkers  is allowed. Second, it comes to a  sticky\r\n\r\nend,  as  it did in Shanghai and Tientsin and  the\r\n\r\nother  China  ports.  It was  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nsharing profits there. It was a question of paying\r\n\r\nfor  the  exploitation they had done in the  past,\r\n\r\nuntil  finally, quite legally and quite  properly,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of the Chinese People's  Republic\r\n\r\nsqueezed  the last ounce of capital out  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign companies and drove them out of China.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not want to do that here, but we would like to\r\n\r\nremind these companies that unreasonable attitudes\r\n\r\ntowards  their  workers, bad  working  conditions,\r\n\r\npoor  wages and the desire to get the most out  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers will lead to a situation  which  will\r\n\r\nmake it very difficult for them to do business, as\r\n\r\nmost  people  would like them to do  business,  in\r\n\r\nthis  country, but on terms fair and just to local\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I oppose this amendment to my motion and I\r\n\r\ndeplore the fact that the Government did not  have\r\n\r\nthe  courage to declare its stand. That it did not\r\n\r\ndo  what  it  wants to do, namely, to endorse  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  claims because it knows it is just.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  the  power, in  the  granting  or\r\n\r\nwithholding  of  the  franchise,  to  support  the\r\n\r\nworkers' claims. The Chief Minister has given  the\r\n\r\nassurance that he will do everything in his power.\r\n\r\nSir,  if the Chief Minister means that, then I  am\r\n\r\nconfident there will be a settlement, because  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister and his Government have the power.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite  true  that  his  is  not  the  only\r\n\r\ngovernment   involved  in  this  franchise,   that\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways can, presumably, ply between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  Borneo and bypass Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nmove its operational headquarters to Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\nBut  I should hardly think many people would  want\r\n\r\nto fly to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKluang  or  Johore Bahru.

For my part,\r\n\r\nI  would  be more satisfied if the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nwould confirm, in full knowledge of the powers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in this matter, what he  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  \"if  the  workers will return to  work,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  do  everything  possible   (the\r\n\r\noperative words are 'everything possible', because\r\n\r\na  lot  of  things  are possible  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways Limited) to get a token payment at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the franchise.\" If that is confirmed,\r\n\r\nfor  my  part, I will try my best to get his  plea\r\n\r\nanswered.  I would remind the Chief Minister  that\r\n\r\n600  men, most of them local-born (40 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthem   English-educated  and   the   rest   Malay-educated),  are involved and they will not  forget\r\n\r\nthis  assurance.  If this is meant  seriously  and\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously,  there should be  a  settlement,\r\n\r\nbecause the Government has the wherewithal to  see\r\n\r\nthat there is a settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  had not intended to speak on this  motion\r\n\r\nbecause,  whilst  my friend the hon. and  learned\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar was away on his Christmas\r\n\r\nholidays,  I had the privilege of acting  for  the\r\n\r\nunion in its efforts to obtain a settlement of its\r\n\r\nclaims, and I felt that to speak would be to speak\r\n\r\nwith  bias from their point of view, since  it  is\r\n\r\ntheir point of view which I had studied. That Sir,\r\n\r\nis the misfortune of the second part of the motion\r\n\r\nbefore  this House, that it seeks to bring  before\r\n\r\nthis  House a matter in dispute at the moment  and\r\n\r\nseeks to bring it from one point of view only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  is my friend from Tanjong Pagar who is  the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser of the union who can speak and speak\r\n\r\nwell  on their behalf; but there is nobody to meet\r\n\r\nthe other side if the other side, in fact, has any\r\n\r\nreasonable defence, which is not admitted. But  it\r\n\r\nis  unfortunate,  Sir, that this  type  of  motion\r\n\r\nshould  be brought and this Assembly be  made  the\r\n\r\nforum  for discussion of disputes current  outside\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  and  thereby biasing  their  proper\r\n\r\nnegotiation  procedure. But whilst  I  understand,\r\n\r\nsympathise and support the attitude adopted by the\r\n\r\nGovernment from the point of view that  it  cannot\r\n\r\naccept  a motion which interferes with the  normal\r\n\r\nprocedure for negotiation and which seeks to  bias\r\n\r\nnegotiation, I would like to say for myself that I\r\n\r\nfind  myself in complete sympathy with the second\r\n\r\npart of the motion moved by the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayan Airways has had a monopoly. I believe\r\n\r\nthe monopoly was an illegal monopoly - the point  is\r\n\r\nnot  now  in issue. It has had it and although  we\r\n\r\nwere very near to challenging the monopoly in  the\r\n\r\ncourt,   unfortunately  that  challenge  was   not\r\n\r\npursued.  But the important thing to recognise  is\r\n\r\nthat  when a government grants a monopoly, whether\r\n\r\nlegal or otherwise, and when a company receives  a\r\n\r\nfranchise for monopolistic services, the  emphasis\r\n\r\nis on service to the people of the country. Now in\r\n\r\nfairness  to Malayan Airways it has given  service\r\n\r\nto  Malaya  a  hundred  per  cent  free  from  any\r\n\r\naccident.  That is a magnificent record.  But  the\r\n\r\nservice  has not been efficient from the point  of\r\n\r\nview  of the excessive fares they charge and which\r\n\r\nthey  could extract, because they are a  monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe  service has not been efficient from the point\r\n\r\nof  view  of excessive profits - repeat,  excessive\r\n\r\nprofits - that they make, and their service  is  not\r\n\r\nefficient  in  that, having made  these  fantastic\r\n\r\nprofits  over the years, they do not  see  fit  to\r\n\r\ngive a portion thereof to the people who work  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, socialism, of which I am not a pandit but\r\n\r\nwhich  I seek to understand, as a basic philosophy\r\n\r\ntries  to obtain a minimum adequate for the decent\r\n\r\nlivelihood of a human being and compatible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  fact  that  he is a  human  being.  The\r\n\r\nemphasis  is always on salaries and conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  Bonus as such does not come in,  but  it\r\n\r\nhas  been recognised over the years that where  an\r\n\r\nemployer has more than a modest profit, it is only\r\n\r\nright  and  proper,  as  an encouragement,  as  an\r\n\r\ninducement,  and also as part of its  humanitarian\r\n\r\nduty to its employees, to share those profits. But\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of Malayan Airways is inhuman.  They\r\n\r\nare  gorged and bloated with profits year by  year\r\n\r\nand  they cannot and will not pay just that little\r\n\r\nwhich  even  commercial companies, with commercial\r\n\r\nmorality   (or   immorality)  in  this   territory\r\n\r\npay - even banks have the decency to pay bonuses  to\r\n\r\ntheir  staffs. Why should Malayan Airways, with  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly granted by the people of this country, be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  act as Scrooge? Why should  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  seek to refuse what is a moral obligation\r\n\r\nnow  recognised  by every decent company  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry? Year after year it makes profits. Not one\r\n\r\nyear  does  it give just one month's salary  which\r\n\r\nevery   reasonable   employer   has   learnt    is\r\n\r\ntraditional  and  fair  in the  treatment  of  its\r\n\r\nemployees. I would like to say, Sir, that though I\r\n\r\nsupport this amendment, I support it with a  heavy\r\n\r\nheart  on the basis of the principle that  motions\r\n\r\nof  this  character should not be brought  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse   in   order  to  bias  proper   negotiating\r\n\r\nmachinery,  but  my  whole sympathy  is  with  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Airways employees - and may they win!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, before I speak on this\r\n\r\namendment, I wish to answer the remark made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar that he was ashamed  to\r\n\r\nobserve  that only his P.A.P. clique had dared  to\r\n\r\ntouch on this controversial issue and champion it.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to point out, Sir, that while the  Member\r\n\r\nwas  moving his motion, I was not here  because  I\r\n\r\nhad  a  very urgent appointment elsewhere,  but  I\r\n\r\ntried  to  rush  back in time  to  speak  on  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take a keen interest in this issue\r\n\r\nbecause  I  fight for the principle of the  thing.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Minister has divided the motion into two\r\n\r\nparts -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If the hon.\r\n\r\nMember will speak about that, he will be in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, actually I wish to\r\n\r\noppose  the amendment and I will say why I  oppose\r\n\r\nit.  As  I have said, Sir, the Chief Minister  has\r\n\r\ndivided  the  motion into two parts - that  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree. The Chief Minister is quite contented  with\r\n\r\nthe  first part and maybe it can win the  approval\r\n\r\nof this House, even of the Opposition. But, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  it is wrong in that the Government  has  no\r\n\r\ncourage  to comment on this issue, whether  it  is\r\n\r\nright  or  wrong. The principle of profit  sharing\r\n\r\nbetween  employer and employee, according  to  the\r\n\r\nmain speaker, derives from a Chinese tradition -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

He can assume for  the\r\n\r\nmoment  that  the principle has been accepted  and\r\n\r\ndebate the second part of the motion, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House urges Malayan Airways Limited to\r\n\r\nshare 15 per cent of their accumulated net-profits\r\n\r\nwith  their  workers at the end of  their  10-year\r\n\r\nfranchise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I will make it short, Sir. I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  House agrees with the principle  of\r\n\r\nprofit sharing between employer and employee.  The\r\n\r\nvarious  Parties in this House have  put  this  in\r\n\r\ntheir  programme. So to me it seems  rather  silly\r\n\r\nand  a waste of time to debate this. To the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  this makes no  sense  at  all.  By\r\n\r\ntradition,  the employer shares his  profits  with\r\n\r\nhis employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose this amendment because I do not\r\n\r\nthink  this is the right time to introduce it.  If\r\n\r\nthis  House has no power to compel an employer  to\r\n\r\nshare  his profit with his employees, what is  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  our  coming to this Chamber and  debating\r\n\r\nthis  issue? It is a waste of time. Sir,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe mover of the amendment has not the courage  to\r\n\r\nface the issue.

I was\r\n\r\nsaying just now, Sir, that in Singapore we have\r\n\r\nprofit-sharing. Let us take Market  Street,  as\r\n\r\nan  example. There a large number of  companies\r\n\r\nare  run  by Hokkiens. They put in capital  and\r\n\r\nthey  manage the business. Every year they find\r\n\r\nout  how  much  net profit they make  and  they\r\n\r\nusually  divide it up this way: 80 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  profit will go to those who invest in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness. 10 per cent of the profit goes to the\r\n\r\nmanagerial  staff, and the balance  of  10  per\r\n\r\ncent to the labour force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then along Circular Road and the New Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad  area, every year they allow at least  one\r\n\r\nor two shares out of 12 shares of the profit to\r\n\r\nbe  given  to the employees. In other areas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore the percentage ranges from 5 per cent\r\n\r\nto  25 per cent. As a matter of fact, Sir, even\r\n\r\nif  a  company makes no profit at all  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  is running at a loss, that company  will\r\n\r\nstill  have to give a little bonus in the  form\r\n\r\nof  angpows. Sir, this has been the practice in\r\n\r\nthe  East  for a very long time. However,  with\r\n\r\nEuropean firms they prefer to calculate it on a\r\n\r\nsalary   basis.  Many  companies   give   their\r\n\r\nemployees one month's salary as a bonus.  Other\r\n\r\ncompanies  are more generous. I have heard  one\r\n\r\nor  two  companies have given  their  employees\r\n\r\nsomething like six months' salary as bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, Sir, the bonus is not\r\n\r\ngiven  at  a  fixed rate. A bonus is  a  matter\r\n\r\nbetween the employer and the employee. There is\r\n\r\na  dispute  today. I think Malayan Airways  are\r\n\r\nmorally bound to give their employees a  bonus.\r\n\r\nHow  much  it  should be, I am not prepared  to\r\n\r\nsay.  If  they are not generous, they  will,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  earn  a  not  so  good  name  as   an\r\n\r\nemployer,  if  they  are  more  generous,   the\r\n\r\nemployees  will be more grateful and  will  co-operate with them more. But for us to prejudice\r\n\r\nthe case and say that they should only give  15\r\n\r\nper cent and not 20 per cent or 25 per cent  or\r\n\r\neven 10 per cent - that, I think, is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Make it more if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I suggest that the\r\n\r\nemployer   and   the  employees   should   come\r\n\r\ntogether.

But, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  motion  seems to me now to be a Party  issue.\r\n\r\nThe  mover  of the motion has an eye  on  the  600\r\n\r\nvotes,  because  I see the Malayan  Airways  union\r\n\r\nleaders   are   present  in   the   gallery   now.\r\n\r\nOpportunist leaders speak in this House on  issues\r\n\r\nin  order to win the support of the people, but  I\r\n\r\nfeel  I  must discharge my duty to the people  and\r\n\r\nsay this. When the debate was going on just now, I\r\n\r\nthought that the whole thing was a farce, that all\r\n\r\nthis debate was just a waste of time. Although the\r\n\r\nmotion  says  that  this House urges  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways  to  give 15 per cent of their accumulated\r\n\r\nprofits-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We have finished with\r\n\r\nMalayan  Airways  Limited,  and  are  now  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of profit sharing. If the  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nagrees with this, he can say that he does. If he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes   not   agree,  he  can  speak  against   the\r\n\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am against the\r\n\r\nprinciple   of   sharing   profits   during   this\r\n\r\ntransitional period. We are still under the  Crown\r\n\r\nand  this  is still the Colony of Singapore.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister said not so long ago  that  we\r\n\r\nare going to fight for merdeka, a merdeka which is\r\n\r\nonly    for    self-government   and   not    even\r\n\r\nindependence. The fight for merdeka  has  come  to\r\n\r\nthe stage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Question now before the\r\n\r\nHouse  is, \"That this House supports the principle\r\n\r\nof profit-sharing between employer and employees.\"\r\n\r\nWill the hon. Member confine himself to that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. But the\r\n\r\nprinciple is still there. We have not yet come  to\r\n\r\nthe  stage  where we can frame policy  and  compel\r\n\r\nemployers  to  share  their  profits  with   their\r\n\r\nemployees.  Although I support  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nthis   motion - the  first  part  and   the   second\r\n\r\npart - wholeheartedly. I think that it is introduced\r\n\r\nat  the  wrong time and not in the right way.  The\r\n\r\nmotive  of  the mover of the motion is  not  truly\r\n\r\nfighting for the interests of the people. It is to\r\n\r\nseek the 600 votes from-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is imputing\r\n\r\nan  improper motive to a Member of this House.  It\r\n\r\nis completely out of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir. Can I\r\n\r\nsay  his Party then? The Party which seeks to move\r\n\r\nthis motion is not sincerely seeking a solution to\r\n\r\nthis controversy between Malayan Airways and their\r\n\r\nemployees. I say this is not the right  time.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  I know a legal firm called Lee  and  Lee\r\n\r\nand  I  wonder  whether the  proprietors  of  this\r\n\r\ncompany  are  sharing  their  profits  with  their\r\n\r\nemployees  at this time. I think the principle  of\r\n\r\nprofit sharing at the moment is out of place, Sir.\r\n\r\nSir,  to  me the point at issue is whether Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways has been given a monopoly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon.

However, I give my sympathy to the  workers\r\n\r\nof Malayan Airways. I support the actual intention\r\n\r\nof  the  motion, but because of the motive  behind\r\n\r\nthis  motion and in view of the present situation.\r\n\r\nI beg to oppose the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nhearing  the  speech by the Member for  Changi,  I\r\n\r\nmust confess I do not know whether I am sitting or\r\n\r\nstanding!  I  cannot  understand  why  he  is  now\r\n\r\nopposing this motion, even on principle. One thing\r\n\r\nI do agree with him, however, is that the original\r\n\r\nmotion as framed by the leader of the P.A.P. does\r\n\r\nappear to be meant as a vote-catching stunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled that out\r\n\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I apologise, Sir. I do confess\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  been  confused by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi. By supporting the motion as it stands  now\r\n\r\nafter  it  has  been  amended, however - \"That  this\r\n\r\nHouse  supports  the principle  of  profit-sharing\r\n\r\nbetween  employer and employees\" - we are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nsupporting the claims of the employees of  Malayan\r\n\r\nAirways,  and  definitely  all  Members  here,  by\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  approval and  voting  for  this\r\n\r\nmotion, are  in  fact telling  all  employers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   that  they  approve  their  generosity\r\n\r\ntowards  their employees. After all. Sir,  profit-sharing is actually a bonus and is something  that\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  given  freely,  to  be  given  as  an\r\n\r\ninducement   for  the  employee  to  give   better\r\n\r\nservice,  and it must be left to the  employer  to\r\n\r\njudge  at  the end of the year the performance  of\r\n\r\nhis  employee  and  how much  he  has  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess of the business in making profit for  that\r\n\r\nyear.  To  attempt to legislate  for  any  profit-sharing between employer and employee would  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  wrong  move  and I am quite  sure  it  would\r\n\r\nfrighten away capital from this already frightened\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore, Sir, have pleasure in supporting the\r\n\r\nmotion  as  amended and I am quite sure  that,  by\r\n\r\nsupporting the motion, this House will go very far\r\n\r\ntowards  helping in a settlement of  this  unhappy\r\n\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\namendment  was proposed. I was surprised  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  the  leader of the P.A.P. that the  Liberal-Socialists did not support the principle of profit-sharing  between  employer and  employee.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink the hon. Member knows full well that one  of\r\n\r\nthe platforms of our Party is that there should be\r\n\r\nprofit-sharing between employer and employee.  But\r\n\r\nI am a little surprised to hear that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nadopting this attitude, because their attitude,  I\r\n\r\nthink, was \"Down with capital!\" and anything  that\r\n\r\nhas to do with capital must be destroyed. This,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   is  a  change  for  the  better   and   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate the P.A.P. for coming round  to  this\r\n\r\nmoderate line which we have been taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of profit-sharing, I think it is\r\n\r\nimportant  for all employers to realise  that,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  make  greater profits,  there  must  be\r\n\r\ngreater  goodwill towards their employees, because\r\n\r\nthen the employees will respond favourably towards\r\n\r\nsuch  treatment, work harder and make more  profit\r\n\r\nfor  the employers. If employers try to be  stingy\r\n\r\nand  grudge a fair share of their profit  for  the\r\n\r\nemployees,  then  they will  be  faced  with  such\r\n\r\nthings  as go-slow tactics, and finally, a  strike\r\n\r\nwhich  will  bring  no  benefit  to  either  party\r\n\r\nwhatsoever. Employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving a share of their profits as an incentive to\r\n\r\ntheir  employees,  employees  working  harder  for\r\n\r\ntheir employers - all this will create a much better\r\n\r\nsituation.  This  motion, I  think,  deserves  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  every right-thinking  person  and  we\r\n\r\nsupport it, as amended, unreservedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Question, as amended, \"That this House\r\n\r\nsupports  the principle of profit-sharing  between\r\n\r\nemployer and employees,\" put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House supports the principle of profit-sharing between employer and employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker adjourned the Assembly without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">6.41 p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
