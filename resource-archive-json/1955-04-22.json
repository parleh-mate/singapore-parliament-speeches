Good luck to you all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  first  meeting  of the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\ninaugurates an epoch in the constitutional history\r\n\r\nof Singapore. In the period of 136 years since its\r\n\r\nestablishment under the British flag as a  trading\r\n\r\ncentre,  Singapore has been transformed  from  the\r\n\r\nsmall  village, which was located here where  this\r\n\r\nHouse  of  Assembly stands, to a centre  of  world\r\n\r\ntrade  with its port ranking as the tenth  busiest\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of this cosmopolitan island has\r\n\r\nhitherto   been  in  the  hands  of   professional\r\n\r\nadministrators. Today Singapore is governed  by  a\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Ministers answerable to a Legislature\r\n\r\nwhich is predominantly popularly elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men and women of good sense will be confident\r\n\r\nthat  under  its new form of Government  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not  only  continue  to  flourish  but  will\r\n\r\nflourish even more healthily than in the past. And\r\n\r\nthere  is good reason for this belief for we  have\r\n\r\nalready had a most striking demonstration  of  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  by the people of Singapore  of  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in  this  matter.  The   General\r\n\r\nElection  held earlier this month showed that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore understand the importance  of\r\n\r\nthe  vote and the need for casting their votes  in\r\n\r\naccordance with their convictions. It is  now  for\r\n\r\nthe  Council of Ministers and this Assembly  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  to  see  to it that the popular  will  thus\r\n\r\ndemocratically expressed is carried  out.  Let  no\r\n\r\nman suppose that he knows better than the Election\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that I should on this occasion\r\n\r\nindicate  the  broad  lines of  policy  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to  pursue  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  the next year in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  have been able to plan it in the  short\r\n\r\ntime since their appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore can best be  served  by  the\r\n\r\nearly   attainment  of  complete  internal   self-government and union with the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  will  direct  its efforts to achieving  these\r\n\r\nimmediate ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuance of these aims, the Government\r\n\r\nintends to give its vigorous support to the policy\r\n\r\nof   staffing  the  Public  Service  with  locally\r\n\r\ndomiciled officers. Whilst seeking this objective,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  recognises  the  just  claims  of\r\n\r\nofficers  recruited from overseas who  have  taken\r\n\r\npart  in  building up the present  administration,\r\n\r\nand  undertakes to look after their interests.  If\r\n\r\nany of these officers are found to be redundant as\r\n\r\na    result   of   the   implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation policy, the Government will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  adequate  abolition  terms  will  be  fixed\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to the interruption of  the  career\r\n\r\nwhich  the officer had a right to expect  when  he\r\n\r\naccepted  his  appointment. In the  meantime,  no\r\n\r\nmore expatriate officers will be appointed without\r\n\r\nprior  reference to the Council of Ministers.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   implicit  confidence   in   the\r\n\r\ncontinued loyalty of the Civil Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that commerce is the\r\n\r\nlifeblood  of the local economy. It  will  be  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Government to foster the expansion\r\n\r\nof  our great entrepot trade which is world-wide,\r\n\r\nand at the same time to encourage in all practical\r\n\r\nways  the  development  of local  industries.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  recognises  the  low  level   of   the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the large mass of the people\r\n\r\nof the country and the threat of unemployment on a\r\n\r\nwide  scale,  and  will seek to encourage  a  more\r\n\r\nequitable  distribution  of  the  income  of   the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the utilisation of its wealth  in  a\r\n\r\nwider field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government awaits with interest the report of\r\n\r\nthe  Mission from the International Bank  for  Re-construction   and  Development  which   recently\r\n\r\nvisited Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. In\r\n\r\nplanning  its  economic policy full  consideration\r\n\r\nwill  be  given  to  the recommendations  of  this\r\n\r\nimportant Mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to secure in the near\r\n\r\nfuture the services of an Economic Adviser, and to\r\n\r\nappoint  an  Economic  Commission  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the most suitable lines of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment   designed  to  improve  the   general\r\n\r\nstandard of living, and increase opportunities for\r\n\r\nuseful work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Commission  will  include  in  its  task  the\r\n\r\nconsideration, in consultation with the  Government\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation of Malaya, of the  question  of\r\n\r\nestablishing a Central Bank for Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a fully representative Trade\r\n\r\nAdvisory   Council  to  advise  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce,  which  was  recommended  by  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nCommission,  will  be  undertaken  forthwith.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment recognises the great importance of close\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  all  commercial  interests   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to arrange for early discussions\r\n\r\nwith  our  important trading partners in  order  to\r\n\r\npromote good neighbourly relations and to stimulate\r\n\r\nthe flow of trade on mutually advantageous terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Government, it is emphasised,\r\n\r\nis  to  raise  the standard of living  of  all  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  and  for  this  purpose  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  private capital is  necessary;  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  encouragement for this will be offered  to\r\n\r\nboth local and overseas investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the vital role of trade\r\n\r\nunionism  in  raising the standard  of  living  and\r\n\r\nfostering  the prosperity of the country,  and  all\r\n\r\npossible  assistance will be given to strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  movement. The Government will pursue a  policy\r\n\r\nof  the  orderly  adjustment of  relations  between\r\n\r\nemployers   and  employees  by  agreement   between\r\n\r\nthemselves. Where the parties are unable  to  reach\r\n\r\nagreement by direct negotiation the services of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour will be freely  available  for\r\n\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the small man in raising his standard\r\n\r\nof  living  greater attention will be paid  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture   to  co-operative  development,  and   more\r\n\r\nemphasis  will be placed on assisting  our  farmers\r\n\r\nand fishermen. To stimulate interest in farming  an\r\n\r\nAgricultural Fair will be held this year. It is the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government to develop as  rapidly\r\n\r\nas  possible  an adequate and suitable road  system\r\n\r\nfor the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperative and pressing need for adequate\r\n\r\nhousing  for  those  in  the  lower  income  group,\r\n\r\nincluding the solution of the problem of the  attap\r\n\r\ndwellers  and  the clearance of  slum  areas  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenge which the Government appreciates can only\r\n\r\nbe  met  by  the  most vigorous and in  some  cases\r\n\r\ndrastic measures. It is the firm intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to find the solution to this problem and\r\n\r\nin  doing  so  it  will in the  future  place  more\r\n\r\nemphasis on the provision of public housing at  the\r\n\r\nlowest  possible  cost  even  if  this  means  some\r\n\r\nlowering of standards. It is also the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  find  ways   and   means   of\r\n\r\nencouraging those in the low-income groups  to  own\r\n\r\ntheir own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broad field of social services, special\r\n\r\nattention   will   be  paid  to  social   security,\r\n\r\nincluding the formulation as soon as practicable of\r\n\r\nstatutory schemes to assist the aged, the  disabled\r\n\r\nand   the  unemployed.  The  needs  of  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren,  including the mentally  deficient,  will\r\n\r\nnot be overlooked. The Community Centre scheme will\r\n\r\nbe  developed and more facilities provided for  the\r\n\r\nunderprivileged  youths  of  Singapore.   Immediate\r\n\r\narrangements are being made for the introduction of\r\n\r\na  free Legal Aid Service, including representation\r\n\r\nin  courts both civil and criminal. The position of\r\n\r\nGovernment pensioners will be examined forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will expand all medical and health\r\n\r\nservices,   particularly  in   the   rural   areas,\r\n\r\nincluding  the establishment of district  hospitals\r\n\r\nand   clinics  and  the  encouragement  of   health\r\n\r\neducation.  A Medical Advisory Council representing\r\n\r\nall  branches of the medical profession will be set\r\n\r\nup  immediately to advise the Minister. One of  its\r\n\r\nearliest  tasks will be to consider the feasibility\r\n\r\nof  introducing  a National Health  Service  scheme\r\n\r\nincluding a service of home visits by doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In education the policy of the Government is to\r\n\r\naim  at  equal  treatment for all schools  and  all\r\n\r\nteachers in those schools. The foundation stone  of\r\n\r\nthe  policy  will  be  a six year  course  of  free\r\n\r\nprimary education for all children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical  education, which the Government  regards\r\n\r\nas   of   paramount  importance  for  the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore,  will  be  expanded  as\r\n\r\nrapidly   as   possible   and   the   question   of\r\n\r\napprenticeship  and training of industrial  workers\r\n\r\nand clerks will be studied at an early date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of legislation, the Government has\r\n\r\nturned its immediate attention to the matter of the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations, which in accordance with the\r\n\r\nlaw are due now for consideration by this Assembly.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I extended by Proclamation the period of\r\n\r\nEmergency for another three months. It remains  for\r\n\r\nthis Assembly to decide at this meeting whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  this  extension is to be confirmed by adoption\r\n\r\nof   the  Proclamation  by  a  resolution  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Meanwhile, I have revoked certain of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations, which the Government after a\r\n\r\npreliminary   examination  is  satisfied   can   be\r\n\r\ndispensed   with   immediately.  The   Government,\r\n\r\nanxious  not to damage the fabric of security,  has\r\n\r\ndecided  after earnest consideration to  submit  to\r\n\r\nyou this Proclamation for adoption at this meeting,\r\n\r\nand  is  in  process of exhaustively examining  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations and the Banishment Ordinance\r\n\r\nwith  a  view,  in  so  far as is  practicable,  to\r\n\r\ndispensing  with  such  powers  as  are  no  longer\r\n\r\nnecessary  and to the exercise of powers  essential\r\n\r\nfor  the  maintenance of law and order  within  the\r\n\r\nframework of normal legal procedure. In considering\r\n\r\nthis  matter, regard will be had to all the factors\r\n\r\ninvolved, including the Emergency situation in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards general matters of defence, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes  to  examine  immediately  the\r\n\r\norganisation  of  the Local Forces with  particular\r\n\r\nreference to the operation of the National  Service\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Objections  and criticisms  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to the requiring of young  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  undertake national service  will  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to the closest consideration, and  it  is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Government that, so far\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  is practicable, these objections and criticisms\r\n\r\nshall  be  met  within the policy  of  building  up\r\n\r\nadequate  local  forces,  which  cannot  await  the\r\n\r\nattainment of complete self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bill to establish the City and Island Council\r\n\r\nwill be ready for consideration by the Assembly  in\r\n\r\nthe   near  future,  and  this  Bill  will  include\r\n\r\nprovision  for the introduction of multi-lingualism\r\n\r\nin  that  Council. It is hoped that the success  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an  arrangement will lead to the granting  of\r\n\r\nsimilar provision to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to introduce a Labour Bill\r\n\r\nto  replace  the present outmoded Labour Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThere   is  every  likelihood  of  agreement  being\r\n\r\nreached  with  Her Majesty's Government  that  this\r\n\r\nBill  should  cover the civilian employees  of  the\r\n\r\nthree Services recruited in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will seek additional powers for the\r\n\r\nacquisition of land for public purposes, and powers\r\n\r\nfor  the  freezing of values of immovable property.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  firm  intention of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the land is used in the best interests\r\n\r\nof  the  people. The Torrens system of Land  Titles\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced in the near  future  with  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  reducing the cost of land  transactions\r\n\r\nand  generally  simplifying  the  process  of  land\r\n\r\ntenure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further the carrying out of public housing and\r\n\r\nslum  clearance, legislation will be introduced  to\r\n\r\nset up a Housing Authority to replace the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfactory state of public transport calls\r\n\r\nfor  early  action, and to this end the  Government\r\n\r\ncontemplates   the  setting  up  of   a   Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority which will include in its functions  the\r\n\r\nallocation of routes and the fixing of fares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government contemplates amending the Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Ordinance to permit the use of  trade  union\r\n\r\nfunds  for  political activities and to remove  the\r\n\r\npresent restrictions on Government trade unions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoining  federations  of  unions  not  confined  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees.

The public debt  is  very  small.\r\n\r\nFavourable trading conditions during the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears have enabled substantial reserves to be built\r\n\r\nup  and  some of these reserves have been  utilised\r\n\r\nfor  long  term loans to the Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  while  a further portion has been  earmarked\r\n\r\nfor development purposes. A Special Reserve of $100\r\n\r\nmillions has also been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, certain points arising out of\r\n\r\nthe  financial position which give cause  for  some\r\n\r\nconcern. There are indications that revenue, on the\r\n\r\npresent  basis of collection, is tending  to  level\r\n\r\noff.  It  is  also clear that recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  increase  steadily as the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nexisting development plans gains momentum.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, unless steps are taken  to  increase\r\n\r\nrevenue  on the one hand and to control expenditure\r\n\r\non  the  other, there is considerable  danger  that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will  exceed  revenue  by   increasing\r\n\r\namounts  in the future, and that the reserves  will\r\n\r\nbe exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the intention of the Government\r\n\r\nto  make  an  immediate examination of the  revenue\r\n\r\npotential and to introduce as soon as possible such\r\n\r\nmeasures  for increasing revenue as are  considered\r\n\r\npracticable, having regard to the intention of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to increase the economic prosperity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  to encourage enterprise and  to  expand\r\n\r\ntrade  and  industry. An examination will  also  be\r\n\r\nmade  of  the  existing machinery of Government  to\r\n\r\nensure  that any waste, inefficiency and redundancy\r\n\r\nis  eradicated and that the Government  service  is\r\n\r\nmaintained as an efficient and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomical machine for the execution of the  policy\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, I should like to conclude\r\n\r\nthis  Address by expressing my own sense of  regret\r\n\r\nthat  this  is the last occasion on which  I  shall\r\n\r\nspeak  in  the  Legislature.
