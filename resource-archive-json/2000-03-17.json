Dr Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, when parents\r\n\r\nexpress  dissatisfaction with the education system, I  expect\r\n\r\nthat  part of the problem may lie with the system,  but  part\r\n\r\narises from parents' own response to the system.  It seems to\r\n\r\nme  that if we could engage parents in the education process,\r\n\r\nshare information with them about policies and how they work,\r\n\r\nthe reasons for them, the benefits and good outcomes, and the\r\n\r\nmisperceptions  and misconceptions that  they  may  have,  we\r\n\r\ncould   go  some  way  towards  gaining  the  awareness   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  alleviating the angst that  many  parents\r\n\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example is information that the Minister shared\r\n\r\nat the recent sitting that 60% of our school leavers actually\r\n\r\nmake  it  to  our  local universities and polytechnics.   The\r\n\r\nimplication  of 60% making it to tertiary education  is  that\r\n\r\nparents  do not have to move heaven and earth to try and  get\r\n\r\ntheir  children's performance to the top few percentile  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  fairly average children will be able  to  make  it\r\n\r\nthrough tertiary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how many parents were or even now are\r\n\r\naware  of that statistic, but certainly information  of  that\r\n\r\nnature would give them significant comfort.  And I think that\r\n\r\nwe  could do more in getting parents involved in this process\r\n\r\nand give them this kind of understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hospitals, we find that time invested upfront in\r\n\r\ncommunicating  with  parents of young  patients  yields  much\r\n\r\ndividends  in  gaining their understanding and tolerance  and\r\n\r\nreducing anxiety in the subsequent interactions in the course\r\n\r\nof  their children's care and management.  I am acutely aware\r\n\r\nof  the  House having just discussed on Wednesday  about  the\r\n\r\nburdens  of the workload that our teachers face, but I  think\r\n\r\nthat  time spent with parents explaining policies and sharing\r\n\r\ninformation would be well worth the investment.  And  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry will be on the look out for opportunities\r\n\r\nto  share  useful information with parents and  engage  them,\r\n\r\nwherever possible, in the education process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, we often read in the\r\n\r\nStraits   Times   of  delinquent  school   children.    While\r\n\r\ndiscipline  is  an  age-old problem,  it  seems  from  recent\r\n\r\nreports that disciplinary  problems are on the rise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level, I often receive complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  residents of students who misbehave themselves  outside\r\n\r\nschool.  It seems that students and perhaps even some schools\r\n\r\noperate  on  the principle that what the students do  outside\r\n\r\nthe school is not the concern of the school and should not be\r\n\r\nwithin the school's control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we receive reports of students loitering at\r\n\r\nthe  void  decks and engaging in such anti-social  activities\r\n\r\nlike  smoking,  littering and vandalism.  To  be  fair,  some\r\n\r\nschools have resorted to ensuring that their students do  not\r\n\r\nengage  in such activities by sending members of their  staff\r\n\r\non patrol in the neighbourhood.  I am not sure if all schools\r\n\r\nhave  such a practice.  On the other hand, it seems that  the\r\n\r\nschools  can only intervene in a limited manner,   as  beyond\r\n\r\nthat  I am not sure whether all schools have the practice  of\r\n\r\nchecking  on  the  behaviour and conduct of  their  students.\r\n\r\nCertainly, when children misbehave themselves, it  gives  the\r\n\r\nschool  a rather bad name.  Needless to say, it is imperative\r\n\r\nthat   we  continue  to  ensure  that  our  students   remain\r\n\r\ndisciplined,  as  this may impact on our  population  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Ministry has a system in place\r\n\r\ncalled  the  behavioural tracking and  analysis  system  that\r\n\r\ntracks  the  number of delinquent cases in schools.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether or not disciplinary problems\r\n\r\nhave  been on the rise and what additional measures, if  any,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is going to take in dealing with the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there have been\r\n\r\nmany   reports   in  the  media  these  days  regarding   the\r\n\r\ndeterioration of family values.  There have been  reports  of\r\n\r\nacts  of  atrocities between teenagers, gang  fights  amongst\r\n\r\nteenagers, abandonment of babies by teenagers and so  on.   I\r\n\r\nknow that families have the responsibility to imbue the right\r\n\r\nvalues  in  their  children  and  to  discipline  them   when\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It is acceptable to argue that the  teachers  in\r\n\r\nschools  can  only  do so much.  However,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nbeseech  the Minister for Education to reassess this area  to\r\n\r\nsee  how the Ministry of Education could chip in here and nip\r\n\r\nthe problem in the bud before things get out of hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the school's main task is to impart skills\r\n\r\ntowards academic achievement, all the efforts will be  wasted\r\n\r\nif  moral values deteriorate further.  I hope the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation will consider the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteaching and observance of moral and good values in  life  as\r\n\r\nan  integral part of education.  The teachers in schools  are\r\n\r\nin  an extremely good position to diagnose early symptoms  of\r\n\r\ndelinquency in many cases, as students do spend a lot of time\r\n\r\nin  school.  There are many full school days, especially  for\r\n\r\nsecondary students, and the teachers are in a lot of  contact\r\n\r\nwith  their students.  The schools should be able to identify\r\n\r\nat-risk  children  and  either alert their  families  or  any\r\n\r\norganisation or community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for the deterioration of family values\r\n\r\nin  many  instances  is due to underlying faults  within  the\r\n\r\nfamily  unit or to lack of discipline at homes.  These trends\r\n\r\nmay  be  on the increase with more broken homes and increased\r\n\r\ndivorces.  The lack of discipline is compounded by  the  norm\r\n\r\nof  the  dual income families of Singaporeans with  two-child\r\n\r\nfamilies  or  less.  Has the Ministry of Education  done  any\r\n\r\nstudies  on these problematic students thus far, to find  out\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  problems in them?   Could  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  help those students who are predisposed  to  these\r\n\r\nproblems  and take a  more proactive approach to prevent  the\r\n\r\nill effects?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that every Singaporean counts.\r\n\r\nThis  being  so and since some kids need more attention  than\r\n\r\nothers,  would the Ministry of Education not have to allocate\r\n\r\nmore  time and effort for these high-risk students?  It would\r\n\r\nbe  good if the Ministry of Education could collaborate  with\r\n\r\nparents,  voluntary welfare organisations,  self-help  groups\r\n\r\nand more professional counsellors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister for Education whether he\r\n\r\nneeds  to review the discipline meted out by schools in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  increased  rate of offences committed  by  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  students, especially female school students?   Should\r\n\r\nthe  schools not use more mentors and role models to lead the\r\n\r\npupils?  Could the Minister consider self-esteem courses  for\r\n\r\nsecondary school students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be good to teach children how to empower\r\n\r\nthemselves to succeed in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife through a correct understanding of one's self worth  and\r\n\r\nthrough one's core values.  A lot of delinquency and gangster\r\n\r\nissues  stem  from  lack of self esteem.  Gangs  provide  the\r\n\r\nsecurity and status that the delinquents do not have  due  to\r\n\r\ntheir family situation.  Employment of external organisations\r\n\r\nto  facilitate this may be helpful. I know that some  schools\r\n\r\nhave  engaged outside parties for this purpose.  Perhaps this\r\n\r\nshould be put in as a core non-academic curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Education could enlighten\r\n\r\nme on these issues I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, the three\r\n\r\nMembers  have  raised various issues concerning our  students\r\n\r\nand  the  role  of parents.  May I take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nenlighten  Members on some of the efforts undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to achieve some of these improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, holistic education of a child, we believe,\r\n\r\ncannot  and  should  not fall squarely on  the  shoulders  of\r\n\r\nschools.  Parents and the community have a role to play.   In\r\n\r\nthis case, I agree with both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Dr Lily  Neo\r\n\r\nthat  we  need  to  get our children to  believe  in  and  to\r\n\r\npractise the good values taught in our schools.  Parents  and\r\n\r\ncommunity   too  help  in  moulding  the  child's  character,\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  his  inner motivation, developing  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging,  spirit of service to the community, and  also  in\r\n\r\ncreating the environment to help the child learn better.  The\r\n\r\nleverage comes from parents, community and schools working in\r\n\r\ntandem   to  nurture  our  young.   Also,  where  one   faces\r\n\r\nconstraints,  the  others can rise to the call  and  help  to\r\n\r\naddress the need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main reasons why the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis  now  stepping  up  its  efforts  in  strengthening  these\r\n\r\npartnerships.  The first is to recapture some of  the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  community  service or gotong royong  for  schools.   This\r\n\r\nspirit  used  to  come  about almost naturally  in  the  past\r\n\r\nbecause schools then were mainly set up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  community.  But today, with education being seen  as\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the Government, there is a need and  we\r\n\r\nmust try our best to rekindle the bonding, loyalty and mutual\r\n\r\nsense of responsibility among schools, parents and community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the changing structure of our society and\r\n\r\nhomes.   Dr Lily Neo mentioned that in many households,  both\r\n\r\nparents  work, and therefore they have less time to  interact\r\n\r\nwith   their  children.   Parental  expectations  have   also\r\n\r\nincreased.   And this is natural for every parent would  want\r\n\r\nhis child to succeed and thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MOE, we realise that we need to put in place a\r\n\r\nframework for schools to engage parents and the community  in\r\n\r\nour  children's  education, and at a  level  where  there  is\r\n\r\nmutual understanding of the fundamental purpose of education.\r\n\r\nEvery  child has talent and ability, and MOE aims to  develop\r\n\r\nto  the  fullest each child's potential, so that he  acquires\r\n\r\nthe values, instincts, attitudes, skills and knowledge to  be\r\n\r\na  useful  and responsible individual and citizen.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, we have set up the Community and Parents in  Support\r\n\r\nof Schools (COMPASS).  COMPASS is a national advisory council\r\n\r\nto  advise  the  Ministry on ways and means  to  promote  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen school-home-community collaborations. COMPASS  has\r\n\r\nand  will continue to solicit feedback and ideas from parents\r\n\r\nand   the   community.   It  will  then  develop   a   common\r\n\r\nunderstanding  about  what are the  different  roles  of  the\r\n\r\nschool,  the  parents and the community in the upbringing  as\r\n\r\nwell as the education of our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, many of our schools have built up strong\r\n\r\ntraditions and alumni.  In 1998, MOE announced that  children\r\n\r\nof former students would be given higher priority for Primary\r\n\r\nOne  registration if their parents were also members  of  the\r\n\r\nschool alumni association.  Since then, the number of primary\r\n\r\nschools  with  affiliated alumni associations  has  increased\r\n\r\naround 50%, from 33 to 48.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the School Advisory and Management\r\n\r\nCommittees  that  give members of the community  and  parents\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  be involved in school governance  and  its\r\n\r\nactivities.   Our  schools also conduct meaningful  Community\r\n\r\nInvolvement Programmes that help students build up a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility, belonging and commitment to the community and\r\n\r\ncountry by way of rendering service.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation now is that there is great diversity in\r\n\r\nthe  way  our schools, on their own, involve the parents  and\r\n\r\nthe  community.   Some organise seminars  for  parents  while\r\n\r\nothers  conduct computer courses for parents as well  as  for\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders  and  they  tie  up  with  companies   and\r\n\r\nindustries  for  student  work attachment  programmes.   What\r\n\r\nworks best in a particular school might not meet the needs of\r\n\r\nanother.  Therefore, MOE encourages schools to try out  their\r\n\r\nideas.   In  doing so, they will go out to reach out  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and along the process we will gain some experience,\r\n\r\nand we will build upon it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her suggestion to\r\n\r\nnetwork  with  parents and external agencies, especially   to\r\n\r\nhelp some of our at-risk students.  This is what we have been\r\n\r\ndoing  and  will  continue to strive to do even  more.   Many\r\n\r\nschools   engage  the  services  of  part-time   professional\r\n\r\ncounsellors,  link  up  with  self-help  groups,  MCD,  VWOs,\r\n\r\nneighbourhood police posts or police centres, work  with  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Central Narcotics Bureau to  conduct  talks  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  As for mentors, not only do our schools  tap  on\r\n\r\nolder  students and ex-teachers in the school, but  also  ex-students,  tertiary  students,  parents  and  other   working\r\n\r\nadults.  Many have come forward to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still more that can be done to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  links  between parents, the schools and the community  .\r\n\r\nCOMPASS is actively encouraging parents and the community  to\r\n\r\npartner schools to bring up our young.   Over the past  year,\r\n\r\nCOMPASS have visited schools, received\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbriefings on programmes in schools, and attended a seminar on\r\n\r\nschool-home  collaboration conducted  by  an  expert.   These\r\n\r\nactivities  gave COMPASS the background and understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  issue  to  work  out  what  we  call  the  stakeholders'\r\n\r\nstatements   and   the   models  of   effective   school-home\r\n\r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stakeholders' statements are student-centred and\r\n\r\noutline the roles and qualities we expect of each stakeholder\r\n\r\nin  helping  the child to learn and grow.  At  the  heart  of\r\n\r\nthese statements is the ultimate aim of achieving the Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes  of Education.  These statements should be ready  by\r\n\r\nsometime next month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, COMPASS will be formulating various models of\r\n\r\neffective  school-home-community collaborations so  that  our\r\n\r\nschools  can adopt the good ideas.  This should be  ready  by\r\n\r\nthe end of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the efforts of COMPASS, there will be more frequent\r\n\r\nand  higher  quality interactions among parents, schools  and\r\n\r\nthe  community. In this way, we hope we can better align  our\r\n\r\nefforts  to  develop our young into robust,  industrious  and\r\n\r\nmorally upright citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage partnerships between schools and\r\n\r\nthe  community, MOE decided also to take a wider view of  our\r\n\r\nco-curricula  activities (CCAs).  Previously CCA  marks  were\r\n\r\nonly  awarded for activities offered by schools.   From  this\r\n\r\nyear,  CCA marks are awarded to students in secondary schools\r\n\r\nfor  their representation in an approved organisation or  for\r\n\r\ntheir  contribution of at least 30 hours of community service\r\n\r\nbeyond   the   six  hours  under  the  Community  Involvement\r\n\r\nProgramme.   The  scheme  has also been  extended  to  junior\r\n\r\ncolleges and centralised institutes.  This will encourage our\r\n\r\nstudents  to widen their social circle and interact with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity beyond the school.  We hope to start them young  in\r\n\r\nforging strong links with the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee will be pleased to note that our schools\r\n\r\nengage  not  just the parents but the community  in  the  two\r\n\r\nareas of communication and partnerships.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  had described a little bit about partnerships.  Now I will\r\n\r\ndiscuss a little bit about communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our principals and teachers do plan various\r\n\r\nopportunities  like  the  meet-the-parents  sessions,  school\r\n\r\nnewsletters,  parent-teacher associations, prize-presentation\r\n\r\nevents and these are used to explain changes in our education\r\n\r\nsystem.  They describe how the school programmes develop  our\r\n\r\nchildren holistically and discuss the progress of each child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of MOE, we ensure that all major changes to\r\n\r\nthe  education system and their rationale are also  announced\r\n\r\nthrough  the media and our website.  But we also need parents\r\n\r\nto  do  their  part  by  attending the school  functions,  by\r\n\r\nreading  the school newsletters and also hopefully by keeping\r\n\r\nup with the news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked about discipline matters in our\r\n\r\nschools.  I would report here that the state of discipline in\r\n\r\nour schools is generally good.  This has been found based  on\r\n\r\na  research done earlier.  The great majority of our students\r\n\r\nare  found  to  be hardworking, well-behaved and responsible.\r\n\r\nSerious   cases  of  breach  of  discipline  are   infrequent\r\n\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee on the discipline of female pupils was set\r\n\r\nup  sometime  in  1998 chaired by Dr Aline Wong.   They  have\r\n\r\nlooked into the matter and found out that generally there has\r\n\r\nbeen some increase, but not alarming.  The Committee has also\r\n\r\nmade recommendations ranging from preventive measures such as\r\n\r\npeer support as well as various other programmes intended  to\r\n\r\nachieve what Members asked for, ie, to nip the problem in the\r\n\r\nbud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the hon. Members in the\r\n\r\nHouse, as leaders in their community, to lead their people to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  schools in their constituencies.   We  can  all\r\n\r\ntreat  the children as our own.  Get involved in their  lives\r\n\r\nand engage their parents, and involve them in the life of the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   If  we can work hand in hand to  jointly  assume\r\n\r\nresponsibility for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour young, the Ministry  is confident that we will be able to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  young  develop  to  their  full  capabilities  and\r\n\r\ncontribute positively to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask whether the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation would have any more steps taken to further  improve\r\n\r\nthe  moral  and  good values of our students?   Secondly,  is\r\n\r\nthere  any  system in place in the school where the  teachers\r\n\r\nare able to actively diagnose high risk students?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Other than civic and moral\r\n\r\neducation  that is already in place, we also engage  students\r\n\r\nthrough  the Community Involvement Programme.  This is  where\r\n\r\nwe  plan  to internalise the concept of good moral values  in\r\n\r\nthe children.  They visit homes and engage with the homes  to\r\n\r\ndo  some community service.  This will hopefully help them to\r\n\r\nhave  good moral values.  There are other efforts that we  do\r\n\r\nthrough the schools to help especially those who are at risk.\r\n\r\nThus  far,  we  have trained at least two teachers  in  every\r\n\r\nschool to become teacher-counsellors.  In other words,  if  a\r\n\r\nchild,  through  our behavioural tracking  system,  which  is\r\n\r\nalready  installed in every school, were found to  have  some\r\n\r\nproblem and is likely to become a discipline case, he will be\r\n\r\nreferred to the teacher-counsellor.  In some schools, we have\r\n\r\nthe Special  Constabulary officers who are also helping us to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  some cases of discipline among our children.   So\r\n\r\nthere are such cases.  Other than counselling, the school has\r\n\r\nalso  the  right to impose stricter disciplinary measures  if\r\n\r\nthey  find  it  necessary.  This will  hopefully  reduce  the\r\n\r\nincidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Has the Ministry done any studies on\r\n\r\nproblematic  students in Singapore because such studies  will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in planning for the future policies and  preventing\r\n\r\nus from having such children?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin:</b> I do not know whether we can\r\n\r\nprevent  our country from having such children.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nnormal to have in our schools cases of discipline.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nhon. Members should not be surprised that in some schools the\r\n\r\nnumber\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay increase.  What has happened, as had been explained by my\r\n\r\nMinister earlier, is that our school system is now carrying a\r\n\r\nlot   more   students  than  in  the  past.   What   happened\r\n\r\npreviously, especially before we started streaming  in  1980,\r\n\r\nwas  that  many  of these children would be  outside  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  system.   Therefore, they were not  captured  by  our\r\n\r\nbehavioural tracking system or whatever scheme that  we  have\r\n\r\nin  the schools. What we have done since then is that we want\r\n\r\nto allow them an opportunity to continue to study.  We expect\r\n\r\nthat  some  of them may come to school with some  behavioural\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  school has a system in place to help  them  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can continue to study and not cause any disruption\r\n\r\nto  other students and, where we can, we will do our best  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  to be more disciplined.  Hopefully,  with  better\r\n\r\nexposure  at  secondary school, these children can  later  on\r\n\r\ncontinue with further education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a special study just to find out\r\n\r\nhow we can stop children from misbehaving in our schools, but\r\n\r\nthere  is a system in place to track them and try to identify\r\n\r\nthem early so as to reduce the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the published\r\n\r\ncriteria for university admission by the various faculties in\r\n\r\nNUS  and  NTU  are  actually the minimum  standard  where  an\r\n\r\napplication  will  be considered.  However,  practically,  no\r\n\r\nstudent  with  that  level of minimum standards  is  admitted\r\n\r\ntoday.  As in the COE system, applicants to the faculties are\r\n\r\nstack ranked by their \"A\" level results and then based on the\r\n\r\nvacancies available, a line is drawn.  Those above  the  line\r\n\r\nare  admitted  and those below are not.  It is as  simple  as\r\n\r\nthat.   Except  for  the  Medical  and  Law  faculties  where\r\n\r\ninterviews  are  part of the admission process,  very  little\r\n\r\nweightage is given to other attributes of the candidate.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  for  the  Faculties  of Medicine  and  Law,  where  we\r\n\r\nactually  have a limited number of vacancies available,  they\r\n\r\nare  turning  away candidates who would otherwise  be  highly\r\n\r\nsought after in other universities.  Notwithstanding my  hon.\r\n\r\ncolleague, Dr Jennifer Lee's comment,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that it is not true that parents are not aware that\r\n\r\nmore  than  60%  of  the  cohort is  admitted  into  tertiary\r\n\r\neducation.   It is which faculty they get admitted  into.   I\r\n\r\ndoubt  increasing the percentage will help  the  problem.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  we  have  a  quota system for  the  more  desirable\r\n\r\nfaculties, the competition for more \"As\" and the pressure  to\r\n\r\nacquire higher academic result will not go away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can conclude is that university admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  strongly influence the behaviour of  our  students.\r\n\r\nNo  amount  of exhortation will change the behaviour  if  the\r\n\r\nbottom line is whether they get admitted into the faculty  of\r\n\r\ntheir  choice depends on their \"A\" level results.  I am aware\r\n\r\nthat  a  tentative step has been taken to include Scholarstic\r\n\r\nAptitude  Test (SAT)  results as an additional criterion  for\r\n\r\nadmission into SMU as well as into NUS and NTU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how would the Ministry prevent this\r\n\r\nfrom becoming an additional burden on the students on top  of\r\n\r\ntheir  commitment  to  \"A\" level studies.   Furthermore,  how\r\n\r\nwould  that  contribute to greater involvement in  other  co-curricular  activities?   Perhaps,  can  we  take  one   step\r\n\r\nfurther?   Some  parents have suggested that if  we  set  the\r\n\r\nthreshold  for  the  number  of distinctions  that  would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  for admission into the university and  that  more\r\n\r\nthan  this threshold, the additional distinctions will  carry\r\n\r\nno  weight,  might  we  be  able to change  the  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nexamination results?  Perhaps if we put more weightage on co-curricular  activities,  such  as  participation  in  sports,\r\n\r\nespecially  participation in a national team,  more  students\r\n\r\nmight  be  encouraged  to spend time  in  healthy  activities\r\n\r\nbeyond burying their nose in books.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the next subject under university education, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to touch on  the linkage between the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudent intake of the various faculties and the projection on\r\n\r\nmanpower needs in the economy.  In fact, I recall that at the\r\n\r\ndepth  of our recent recession in 1998 and 1999, around 9,000\r\n\r\ntertiary  educated  persons  were  unable  to  find  suitable\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps  by now, this number has dropped to a number that  is\r\n\r\nless  worrying. What is disturbing to me is that even in  the\r\n\r\ndepth  of  the  recession, we were indeed short  of  computer\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  web designers, and other IT professions,  and\r\n\r\nyet,  on the other hand, there were graduates unable to  find\r\n\r\njobs.   In  other  words, we are not just  having  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  problems  amongst our older  workers  but  also\r\n\r\namongst our young graduates.  Fortunately, Sir, this state of\r\n\r\naffairs  is only transient, it is temporary.  But  are  there\r\n\r\nany  lessons  we  can learn from this?  At first  glance,  it\r\n\r\nwould  imply  that  the universities are  not  adjusting  the\r\n\r\nenrolment  mix  quick  enough to  meet  the  demands  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   For many days now in this Chamber, we  have  heard\r\n\r\nhow  the  new economy is moving at Internet speed.  Yet,  for\r\n\r\nstudents  deciding on their majors, they need to spend  three\r\n\r\nto  four years in that particular major before they come  out\r\n\r\nto  the job market.  Because of this time lag, it is becoming\r\n\r\nall the more important that forecasting of manpower needs  be\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously.   Sir, I would like to find  out  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   how  quickly  we  are  adjusting  the   university\r\n\r\nenrolment in the face of a fast changing job market.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakruppan is not here. Dr Tan Boon\r\n\r\nWan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, going to university\r\n\r\nis   a  major  decision.   It  often  means  sacrifices   and\r\n\r\ncommitment  by  the students and their families.   It  is  an\r\n\r\ninvestment for the future.  The students would therefore want\r\n\r\nto  study a course that is useful to help him find a job.  To\r\n\r\ndecide  on  a course, a student would want to know  how  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are already taking the course.  The GPC Chairman\r\n\r\n(Education),  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, has just said,  despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  in  the  depth of recession, some  students  were\r\n\r\nunable to find jobs, yet the industries were calling out  for\r\n\r\ngraduates  of particular disciplines, such as IT, which  they\r\n\r\nrequired.  So there is, in fact, disparity in the demand  and\r\n\r\nsupply in the various courses.  If students know exactly  who\r\n\r\nare studying what courses, this information\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  allow  our  people to better allocate  their  time  and\r\n\r\nresources in pursuing their courses of study.  Right now,  it\r\n\r\nappears  such  information  as  available  is  partial,   not\r\n\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans can take three major routes to obtain a\r\n\r\nuniversity   education.   They  can  study   in   the   local\r\n\r\nuniversities.  They can study at distance learning outfits in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or  they can study in oversea  universities.   We\r\n\r\nhave  information  on the local universities.   Recently,  we\r\n\r\nobtained  information on the number of  people  studying  for\r\n\r\nuniversity  degrees  through  distance  learning  outfits  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  know  that there are about  22,800  pursuing\r\n\r\ntheir  degrees  through  this  route.   Many  of  these  long\r\n\r\ndistance  learning students are doing business and management\r\n\r\ncourses.   What we still lack is information on  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nstudying overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it is now time for the Ministry to collect\r\n\r\ninformation  of  our  people who are  studying  overseas,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  the courses they are studying and the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  studying them.  Besides, this information  is  also\r\n\r\nuseful for national manpower planning.  If we know the amount\r\n\r\nof  manpower we will have in each area or expertise,  we  can\r\n\r\nthen  encourage  more  to study in areas  where  manpower  is\r\n\r\nscarce  and  discourage others from studying  in  overcrowded\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, under this cut, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  speak  on university education  for  working\r\n\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from the Finance Minister and the Manpower\r\n\r\nMinister  that a key priority of the Government  is  manpower\r\n\r\ntraining.  Resources are amply provided to train and  upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  850,000 adults, above the age of 40, who have less  than\r\n\r\nsecondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this, we should not forget and\r\n\r\nignore  the  need of working adults who have  received  their\r\n\r\nsecondary and post-secondary education and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwanting  to  further their studies to obtain their  diplomas,\r\n\r\ndegrees  and  even higher degrees.  Continuing education  has\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary and essential to work and live  in  today's\r\n\r\nknowledge-based and digital age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a brochure here, \"Singapore's Snapshot - Facts At A Glance\", and there is this heading \"Education\".\r\n\r\nBesides describing the two universities and polytechnics,  it\r\n\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Working adults can enrol in the Open University Degree\r\n\r\nProgramme offered by the Singapore Institute of Management.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good and right to publicise what we are doing\r\n\r\nfor  the  working adults.  Therefore, I am quite disappointed\r\n\r\nthat the overall expenditure budgeted for the Open University\r\n\r\nDegree Programme has been cut by 86% for FY2000.  Even if one\r\n\r\ncan  explain  that  the  bulk of the Development  Expenditure\r\n\r\nprojects has been completed, the running costs should not  be\r\n\r\nreduced by as much as 56%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there has been a drastic decline\r\n\r\nin  the  demand  for  Open University and  distance  learning\r\n\r\nplaces.   If anything, the demand has gone up, as evident  by\r\n\r\nthe  increasing number of overseas universities  and  private\r\n\r\ninstitutions setting up shop in Singapore to tap the  growing\r\n\r\ndemand for undergraduate and postgraduate education.  What is\r\n\r\ndisturbing is the wide variation in the quality and standards\r\n\r\nof   the  overseas  universities  and  institutions  offering\r\n\r\ncourses here.  This has resulted in graduates having spending\r\n\r\nvast amounts of time and money and later finding out to their\r\n\r\ndisappointment that they are not able to secure good jobs and\r\n\r\ntheir qualifications are not as well recognised by employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities and polytechnics should be made more\r\n\r\naccessible to the working adults who want to take courses  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves.   Many courses offered  today  were  not\r\n\r\navailable in the past.  For example, Computer Science and  IT\r\n\r\nsubjects  are  new  courses offered by the  universities  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics only recently.  The new job opportunities in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge-based  economy are  very  different  from  the\r\n\r\nemployment   opportunities  available  in  the  past.    This\r\n\r\nrequires  our  Singaporean  managers  and  professionals   to\r\n\r\nconstantly  upgrade and develop themselves.   Our  executives\r\n\r\nand  managers need to learn and acquire new knowledge, skills\r\n\r\nand  competencies to remain employable and be able to perform\r\n\r\neffectively in their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will become a truly learning nation only if\r\n\r\nour  people  are given free and open access to  new  learning\r\n\r\nopportunities.   Our institutions of higher  learning  should\r\n\r\nopen  their  doors to meet the new educational  and  learning\r\n\r\naspirations  of  our adult population.  I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  provide more funding to boost the educational standing\r\n\r\nof  the  older generation of Singaporeans.  The more educated\r\n\r\nand   enlightened  Singaporeans  are,  the  more  they  would\r\n\r\ncontribute to a stable, cohesive and gracious Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nDr  Wang  Kai Yuen that as long as there is this high  demand\r\n\r\nfor  faculties  of  choice like medicine,  law,  accountancy,\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  computer science, the anxiety of  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents will always be there and even if they know that  60%\r\n\r\ndo  make  it  to tertiary studies.  In line with  helping  to\r\n\r\nrelease  the  pressure,  actually having  more  faculties  of\r\n\r\nchoice  would  be  a good solution, and I think  along  these\r\n\r\nlines,  it  is  good  news that the  NTU  is  thinking  about\r\n\r\nintroducing medicine.  But, in this case, the medicine taught\r\n\r\nthere would be to orientate the students not to practise  but\r\n\r\nto channel their talents to the life sciences and research.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SMU becomes operational this year and that will\r\n\r\nbe  another way to relieve the pressure.  More places will be\r\n\r\ngiven  for  business.   In line with its  name,  there  would\r\n\r\ncertainly  be more degrees and courses in various aspects  of\r\n\r\nmanagement from this University.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMU is also a city university. In line with city-based universities around the world and taking advantage of\r\n\r\nits location in the civic district, it would be good if the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity  goes  on to non-management courses  relevant  and\r\n\r\nrelated to the city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in mind degrees such as urban architecture,\r\n\r\nmanagement and conservation of heritage buildings,  political\r\n\r\nscience,  law,  history or historiography or archaeology  and\r\n\r\nsuch  like  studies.  The city provides the  environment  for\r\n\r\nlearning  these  subjects and live case studies  are  readily\r\n\r\navailable.   Preserving our culture and heritage, discovering\r\n\r\nour  past  and  drawing  lessons from these  for  the  future\r\n\r\nrequire  special skills which are currently not taught  in  a\r\n\r\ndeep way in our universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as law is concerned, we need not worry about an\r\n\r\nover-supply of lawyers either.  Like the suggestion  for  the\r\n\r\nNTU  medicine courses, the students who graduate from the SMU\r\n\r\nlaw  courses  need  not  be  given  the  right  to  practise.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  could  combine their studies  with  politics,\r\n\r\nmanagement or business studies so that they can serve  better\r\n\r\nin  Government,  in  the  diplomatic corps,  professions  and\r\n\r\nindustries  where  law is increasingly complex  and  problems\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplinary in nature, and a knowledge of law would be\r\n\r\nan advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more radical suggestion to make sure that there\r\n\r\nis  no  over-supply of lawyers practising would be to  follow\r\n\r\nthe  lines of what the Law Minister has mentioned many  times\r\n\r\nin  this House, that is, we could increase the quality of the\r\n\r\nlawyers  that come out.  Perhaps in both the NUS  Law  School\r\n\r\nand  the SMU Law School, if ever there is one  -  only  those\r\n\r\nwho  qualify with a Second Lower Honours and above  would  be\r\n\r\ngiven the right to practise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final advantage of having such courses as I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  SMU is that it would avert some of  the  brain\r\n\r\ndrain  and  the  outflow  of  funds  that  we  are  currently\r\n\r\nexperiencing as Singaporeans send their children overseas  to\r\n\r\npursue such studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, from the\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  many people who have been  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnology-based  industries  in  Singapore,  the   important\r\n\r\nlesson  that  all of us have learned is that we have  serious\r\n\r\nweaknesses in the overall industry infrastructure as  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  protection of intellectual property is concerned.  While\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, we do produce a number of lawyers,  there  are\r\n\r\ntoo  few  specialising in this area of intellectual  property\r\n\r\nprotection.   So  if we are serious about promoting  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  especially focusing in the info-com area, we  would\r\n\r\nneed  to  build  up our strength in the area of  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the best intellectual property lawyers are\r\n\r\nthose who have some form of technical training as their first\r\n\r\ndegree; like engineers and scientists, who subsequently  take\r\n\r\non  law  as  a  second degree, they are the best lawyers  who\r\n\r\nactually promote such an industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three questions for the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, of course, can the universities in\r\n\r\nSingapore focus on producing more lawyers whose expertise  is\r\n\r\nin the area of intellectual property protection?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can we allow some flexibility in the admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  in our universities where we allow people who  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  first degree, preferably a technical degree and  have\r\n\r\nhad a number of years of experience and who subsequently want\r\n\r\nto  have  a  change  in career, to take  on  law?   Will  the\r\n\r\nuniversity criteria be modified to allow such people to  take\r\n\r\na  second  degree  in  law?  I am sure there  will  be  other\r\n\r\nMembers who will ask for many other areas for a second degree\r\n\r\nbut since we are talking about promoting this knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, my interest is to ask for a second degree in law for\r\n\r\nthe protection of intellectual property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, perhaps maybe a part-time law degree or Masters\r\n\r\nin Law for people who have had a first technical degree would\r\n\r\nbe  useful.   I think, at this moment, many of  us  and  many\r\n\r\npeople  in  this  industry are turning to  lawyers  from  the\r\n\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  many other countries to file intellectual property issues\r\n\r\nfor  them, because not enough of our lawyers in Singapore are\r\n\r\ncapable of doing it.  So I think this is an urgent issue that\r\n\r\nneeds to be looked into.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, there are many foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  studying in our midst. Most of them will return  to\r\n\r\ntheir home countries eventually. When they do, they could  be\r\n\r\nserving  in  important positions in business and  government.\r\n\r\nMany  will remain friends of Singapore for the rest of  their\r\n\r\nlives.  Some will stay in Singapore and enrich our lives  and\r\n\r\nour talent pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have spent a lot of money to partially or fully\r\n\r\nfinance  their studies here, many of them are  made  to  sign\r\n\r\nbonds that they will work in Singapore for a number of years.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure  that the bonds are taken seriously,  the  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents are asked to get guarantors for their bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some strange reason, these bonds are signed not in\r\n\r\ntheir  home  countries before they come to  Singapore,  where\r\n\r\ntheir  friends and relatives could be roped  in   -   but  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The result is that the students will  ask  their\r\n\r\nlecturers or fellow students, both foreigners and locals,  to\r\n\r\nbe guarantors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the foreign student disappears after graduation, the\r\n\r\nguarantor  has  to  pay  damages.   There  is,  in  fact,  no\r\n\r\nincentive  for  the  foreign  student  to  stay  on  as   his\r\n\r\nguarantors are nothing more than strangers to him most of the\r\n\r\ntime.

This\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  university has raised some  eyebrows.  The\r\n\r\nquestion is: why is NUS taking on such a high exposure  to  a\r\n\r\nsingle  piece  of property for which it appears  to  have  no\r\n\r\ndirect  use  for its pedagogic purposes? The  NUS  should  be\r\n\r\ncommended  for  being proactive in wanting to obtain  greater\r\n\r\nreturns for the excess funds that it has.  Indeed, if  it  is\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  its endeavour, it will help reduce  fees  and\r\n\r\nmake  available  more  resources for  better  programmes  and\r\n\r\nfacilities in the university. But the question really is  the\r\n\r\nmethod  used  by  the university in this regard.   Could  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  administration have chosen to deploy these  funds\r\n\r\nin  investment  assets through fund managers?  Alternatively,\r\n\r\nif  the university's finance committee felt that the property\r\n\r\nsector offers attractive investment asset classes, why not do\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  property funds or real estate investment, investment\r\n\r\ntrusts  or  other investments in property counters themselves\r\n\r\nto  allow  itself  a  greater spread, in terms  of  risk  and\r\n\r\ndiversification?   This  investment  decision  certainly   is\r\n\r\nunorthodox  and  the question may particularly  be  pertinent\r\n\r\nbecause   the  university  does  receive  public  funds   for\r\n\r\noperating expenditure, development expenditure and  also  has\r\n\r\nmatching grants for its endowment fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister whether there are any\r\n\r\npolicies   or  guidelines  that  govern  the  deployment   of\r\n\r\ninvestible funds, which our universities have? Sir, this also\r\n\r\nraises  a broader question of whether our universities  might\r\n\r\nbe  better  off if they were truly private institutions.   We\r\n\r\nare  compelled to ask and raise these questions because  they\r\n\r\nare receiving public funds and entrusted with proper usage of\r\n\r\nthem.   The SMU appears to offer a different model, in  terms\r\n\r\nof being a private company.  The question then is: could this\r\n\r\nbe  used  as a model for other faculties in the universities,\r\n\r\nif  not  for  the entire university itself? It seems  to  me,\r\n\r\nother  than  the  greater flexibility  it  would  afford  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions, in terms of how they manage their resources, it\r\n\r\ncan  also allow them to be closer to the private sector, both\r\n\r\nin  terms  of cooperation with corporations, as  well  as  in\r\n\r\nrewarding  their staff at market rates.  We could start  with\r\n\r\nthe  faculties that are most amenable to privatisation,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  business  faculty, where students  who  go  in,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  for MBAs will be in a reasonably good  position  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the potential economic value of their  degree.   I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate  it  if the Minister  could  address  those\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nonce again, I would like to thank Members for their questions\r\n\r\nand interest in university policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two public universities, NUS and NTU, aim for\r\n\r\nexcellence  in education, research and contributions  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  They have initiated a number\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof    innovative   programmes,   including   broadening    of\r\n\r\nundergraduate  education, introduction of a core  curriculum,\r\n\r\ncollaborations    with   top   foreign    universities    and\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  inter-disciplinary research  centres.  The\r\n\r\nuniversities  are also building niches of excellence  in  key\r\n\r\nareas  where they can achieve global prominence.  Steps  have\r\n\r\nalso  been taken to enhance the vibrancy of campus  life,  by\r\n\r\nattracting  foreign  students.  A  new  university  admission\r\n\r\nsystem will be introduced in 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall come back to some of these points in\r\n\r\ngreater  detail later, but first, let me talk about  how  our\r\n\r\nuniversities can be more innovative and entrepreneurial.  For\r\n\r\nexample, whether we should privatise NUS and NTU, or  certain\r\n\r\nfacilities  in NUS and NTU, as some Members suggested  during\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the SMU Bill, or as suggested by  Mr  Iswaran\r\n\r\ntoday.   I take it that when Mr Iswaran said to privatise the\r\n\r\nuniversities,  he  does not mean that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nstop  funding them, except that we should let them spend  the\r\n\r\nmoney the way they think they ought to spend the money.  That\r\n\r\nis quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In academic matters today, the universities already have\r\n\r\na  considerable degree of autonomy.  While the Ministry  sets\r\n\r\nthe   overall  level  of  public  funding  and  spending   on\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects,  as  statutory  boards,  NUS  and  NTU\r\n\r\nalready  have  a  fair  degree  of  operational  autonomy  in\r\n\r\nfinancial and personnel matters.  The internal allocation  of\r\n\r\nresources  is  largely  left to the  two  universities.  They\r\n\r\ndecide for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry and the universities are currently\r\n\r\nconducting  a review on university governance and funding  to\r\n\r\nencourage  NUS  and NTU to be more innovative and  nimble  in\r\n\r\nresponding to global competition, which is what Mr  Loh  Meng\r\n\r\nSee referred to. The review will identify changes, either  to\r\n\r\npromote  innovation  and enterprise in individual  staff,  or\r\n\r\nfaculties and the university as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Government wants to provide more\r\n\r\nautonomy and flexibility to NUS and NTU, the Government has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  plans  to  privatise  NUS and NTU.   The  launch  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Management University, on the other hand,  provides\r\n\r\nus  with  an  opportunity to try out a  different  governance\r\n\r\nframework. This will allow the governance experiences of  NUS\r\n\r\nand  NTU on the one hand, where they are governed in slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent ways and SMU, on the other hand, to be compared and\r\n\r\nbest practices to be applied, where appropriate, in all three\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address this issue of endowment fund. First of\r\n\r\nall, what is an endowment fund? An endowment fund is a sum of\r\n\r\nmoney  or some asset, which is put aside in order to generate\r\n\r\na  continuing  stream of income.  The endowment  fund  itself\r\n\r\nought  not  to be seen as assets which the university  should\r\n\r\nconsume  for  current expenditure.  Some comments  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  that the monies in the endowment fund can be  used  for\r\n\r\nthe  operating  expenses  for  universities.  That  would  go\r\n\r\nagainst  what an endowment fund is for.  The income from  the\r\n\r\nendowment  fund would help the universities.  I will  explain\r\n\r\nhow a little later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what fund is this that we are talking about?\r\n\r\nThis fund, which the NUS has used to make this investment, is\r\n\r\ncalled  the  General  Endowment  Fund.   How  did  this  fund\r\n\r\noriginate? This fund originated from public contributions  to\r\n\r\nfinance  the University of Malaya's development in the  1940s\r\n\r\nand  1950s. A princely sum of $3.342 million of this  General\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund was used in the 1950s to purchase residential\r\n\r\nproperties  in  the Bukit Timah area for  use  as  staff  and\r\n\r\nstudent  housing.  These were subsequently  acquired  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  1996  and the proceeds  amounting  to  $242.4\r\n\r\nmillion was credited to the General Endowment Fund.   How  to\r\n\r\ninvest  this endowment fund in order get the best  continuing\r\n\r\nreturns  in the long term for the university is a matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  university to decide. It has a finance committee and  an\r\n\r\ninvestment  committee  and  they make  these  decisions.   Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran  is right. There is really no need for us to question\r\n\r\nhow  they make these decisions in Parliament because  I  have\r\n\r\nsome confidence that the members of the investment committee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   decide,  in  the  best  long-term  interests  of   the\r\n\r\nuniversity, to get both capital appreciation, as  well  as  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing stream of income.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university has other endowment funds, including the\r\n\r\nNUS  Endowment  Fund, for which the Government  provides  the\r\n\r\nmatching  grants and some special endowment funds of  smaller\r\n\r\nquantities. The whole idea of these endowment funds comes  to\r\n\r\nthe question of what do we use these endowment funds for. The\r\n\r\nwhole  idea  of  these  endowment  funds  is  to  allow   the\r\n\r\nuniversity to use these funds for projects and activities  in\r\n\r\nline  with  the university's mission and which contribute  to\r\n\r\nits  long-term  development,  but  which  are  otherwise  not\r\n\r\navailable from the budget, from Government grants or from the\r\n\r\nfees  paid by students.  The whole idea of these funds is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  university with the flexibility to  do  things,\r\n\r\nwhich  it thinks it wants to do and for which we may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  completely  agree on.  So, the  whole  idea  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide the university with some flexibility and autonomy  in\r\n\r\nits  operations in the areas of research and development, and\r\n\r\nperhaps student enrichment and so forth, which it wants to go\r\n\r\ninto.   So  we  are quite happy to see these endowment  funds\r\n\r\ndevelop  and provide the university with a continuing  stream\r\n\r\nof  income  for which it can develop its resources.   By  the\r\n\r\nway,  some  of  these  funds can only be  used  for  specific\r\n\r\npurposes,  because  donors,  when  they  donated  the  money,\r\n\r\nspecified its purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the story on the university endowment funds and\r\n\r\nhow  the  monies are invested.  Incidentally, in the case  of\r\n\r\nthe  NUS,  the  decisions are made by the finance  committee.\r\n\r\nThe   finance   committee  reports  to  the   Council.    The\r\n\r\nuniversity's  annual  reports are  audited  by  the  Auditor-General  or  commercial auditors recommended by the  Auditor-General, and the accounts are presented to MOE as well as  to\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, autonomy alone is not going to guarantee\r\n\r\nexcellence. Mr Loh Meng\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee   has   rightly  identified  remuneration   and   service\r\n\r\nconditions  of academic staff as an important factor  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole equation.  The university could only flourish if it has\r\n\r\ncapable and committed staff of high quality who can make  use\r\n\r\nof this autonomy to bring the university close to its goal of\r\n\r\nattaining  world-class  standard.   The  NUS  and  NTU   must\r\n\r\ntherefore   place  priority  on  recruiting  and   developing\r\n\r\nexcellent  staff.   The  existing remuneration  and  benefits\r\n\r\nscheme  in  NUS and NTU is modelled after the civil  service.\r\n\r\nThere  is  some  flexibility in deciding  salaries,  but  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  is  still constrained by the salary  scales  for\r\n\r\ndifferent grades of staff.  As an interim measure,  a  market\r\n\r\nadjustment  allowance has been provided to staff  in  certain\r\n\r\ndisciplines,  eg,  medicine and  in  business.   The  current\r\n\r\nreview  of  university  governance  and  funding  will   give\r\n\r\nuniversities greater flexibility in remunerating staff.   The\r\n\r\nideas being studied include the injection of more performance\r\n\r\nbased and market components into the remuneration system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh has also asked about recruiting good foreign\r\n\r\nstaff  to teach at our universities.  NUS and NTU have indeed\r\n\r\nbeen recruiting overseas staff for many years and, currently,\r\n\r\nmore  than  20%  of  the academic staff are  foreigners,  not\r\n\r\nincluding Singapore permanent residents.  So, Sir, the number\r\n\r\nis actually higher than 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS and NTU are keenly aware that they need to cast\r\n\r\ntheir  net  globally and already have plans to step  up  such\r\n\r\nefforts.  When looking for outstanding staff, whether locally\r\n\r\nor globally, to take our universities to greater heights, the\r\n\r\nuniversities  must be able to provide a remuneration  package\r\n\r\nthat  is  globally market competitive.  However, remuneration\r\n\r\nis only half the story when recruiting and retaining staff of\r\n\r\nhigh  quality.  The reward system needs to be supported by  a\r\n\r\nrigorous  appraisal system, so that there  is  a  clear  link\r\n\r\nbetween  performance and remuneration.   The  rigour  of  the\r\n\r\nappraisal system signals that the university is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious  about quality, and it is such a university that  can\r\n\r\nattract and retain people of high calibre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective appraisal system serves three purposes.\r\n\r\nFirst,  it  encourages desired behaviour by setting  out  the\r\n\r\nexpectations for the staff in the areas of teaching, research\r\n\r\nand  service  to  the  universities.  Second,  the  appraisal\r\n\r\nsystem  helps  the  universities assess how far  expectations\r\n\r\nhave  been met and what improvements need to be made.  Third,\r\n\r\nthe  appraisal  system  allows staff  to  be  recognised  and\r\n\r\nremunerated  according to performance and/or potential.   The\r\n\r\nreview  committee will come out with recommendations  on  how\r\n\r\nthe  current appraisal systems can be strengthened,  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  most  critical resource in any university, its  people,\r\n\r\ncan  be  better managed.  And only then can rewards  be  more\r\n\r\nmeaningfully targeted and help to attract, develop and retain\r\n\r\nstaff of high quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn from staff of universities to\r\n\r\nstudents.   Prof.  Toh  See Kiat has expressed  some  concern\r\n\r\nregarding the bond that foreign students need to sign.  Prof.\r\n\r\nToh  is  right.   Foreign students studying in  our  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions, including permanent residents, benefit  from  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable subsidy, and that is why in return,  after  they\r\n\r\ngraduate,  they have to work in Singapore for  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nthree  years.   Prof.  Toh asked how  many  there  are,  they\r\n\r\ncurrently constitute 20% of our undergraduate intakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry acknowledges that it is inconvenient for\r\n\r\nforeign students to get guarantors, usually their parents  or\r\n\r\nrelatives who are based overseas, to sign the bonds.   Hence,\r\n\r\nfrom  this year, foreign students can send the tuition  grant\r\n\r\ndeeds  overseas for their guarantors to sign in the  presence\r\n\r\nof  a notary public in their home country, rather than having\r\n\r\nto travel to Singapore to sign the papers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being a guarantor is a serious matter and\r\n\r\nguarantors should be aware of their legal obligations.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  aware of the kind of poor advice that is provided by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry officials.  This is a serious\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter,  and  if the Member has knowledge of specific  cases,\r\n\r\nplease let me know and I will advise my officers.  As far  as\r\n\r\nI  know, these legal obligations are made known to them by my\r\n\r\nofficials at the point of signing the deed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh would also be pleased to know that after\r\n\r\nserving their three-year obligation, a good number of foreign\r\n\r\nstudents continue to work in Singapore or Singapore companies\r\n\r\nin the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked about training of lawyers well\r\n\r\nversed  in  intellectual property protection.  The  NUS'  LLB\r\n\r\ncurriculum  has a number of subjects relating to intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  laws,  eg, copyright and patents  which  attract  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of students, and as Mr Singh has correctly said,\r\n\r\nthis is an area of growth.  So our budding young lawyers have\r\n\r\nan  interest  and  they are quite quick to  spot  the  market\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the information technology law course deals\r\n\r\nextensively  with  intellectual property issues  relating  to\r\n\r\ncomputer  technology and Internet.  Many  practising  lawyers\r\n\r\nregister  for  LLM  or  diploma courses   at  NUS.   And  the\r\n\r\nintellectual  property law courses at these levels  are  also\r\n\r\nheavily subscribed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also asked about a second degree. He will be\r\n\r\nhappy to know that this avenue is already open.  In 1998, NUS\r\n\r\nlaunched  the approved graduate programme whereby  candidates\r\n\r\nwith a first degree can complete their LLB programme in three\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to have a part-time law degree, NUS\r\n\r\nwill consider it if there is sufficient demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Loh Meng See asked about university education\r\n\r\nfor  working adults and about the reduction in budget funding\r\n\r\nfor  the open university.  The reduction in budget allocation\r\n\r\nfor  the  open  university  is not an  indication  of  future\r\n\r\nstudent  numbers.  The OUDP has been taking in an average  of\r\n\r\n14,000 students per year in the past three years.  There  are\r\n\r\nno plans to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduce  this  number.   In  fact, OUDP  is  a  self-financing\r\n\r\ninstitution  run by a private organisation.  It  is  free  to\r\n\r\nincrease  those  numbers if it wants to and  if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmarket  demand.   From  the  start  of  the  programme,   the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  was quite clear that OUDP funds the  operating\r\n\r\ncost,  while  Government would fund the  initial  development\r\n\r\ncost,   including  the  cost  of  land,  buildings,  computer\r\n\r\nsystems,  consultancy  by the UK Open University  for  course\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  I think with the bulk of development coming  to\r\n\r\nan end, the budget allocation has also fallen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely with Mr Loh Meng See regarding\r\n\r\ncontinuing education opportunities for working adults, but it\r\n\r\nshould  not  be confined only to universities.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat we are talking about universities here, but most working\r\n\r\nadults  really require upgrading opportunities,  not  at  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  level  but  at  the  polytechnic  level  and   at\r\n\r\ncertificate level.  And the polytechnics and ITE have  really\r\n\r\nbeen  providing quite a lot of opportunities  here  as  well.\r\n\r\nContinuing  education  really  is  the  next  major  wave  in\r\n\r\neducation   -   from  mass primary, mass secondary  and  mass\r\n\r\nfurther   education  and,  I  think,  now   mass   continuing\r\n\r\neducation.  No country has yet worked out a complete doctrine\r\n\r\nor  system for this.  The Ministry of Manpower, Members would\r\n\r\nhave  heard  from Dr Lee, and the Ministry of  Education  are\r\n\r\ncurrently discussing how we can put such a system in place in\r\n\r\nSingapore which will provide Singaporeans the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncarry on with continuing education and learn throughout their\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh has asked about the course offerings in SMU.\r\n\r\nSMU  was  set up to focus on serving the business and finance\r\n\r\nsectors  and SMU will start offering its Bachelor of Business\r\n\r\nManagement programme this August.  Although it is  likely  to\r\n\r\nexpand  its  degree offerings to other related  courses  like\r\n\r\nEconomics,  it  will  continue to maintain  its  focus  as  a\r\n\r\nmanagement university.  There are therefore no current  plans\r\n\r\nfor SMU to offer courses in disciplines removed from business\r\n\r\nmanagement,  especially courses requiring heavy equipment  or\r\n\r\nheavy capital investment.  Perhaps the proposals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Prof. Toh made are certainly things which I am sure  SMU\r\n\r\nwill consider.  The President of SMU is herself a lawyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Tan Boon Wan have asked about\r\n\r\nmanpower forecasting and how many places we allocate to  each\r\n\r\ndiscipline  in the university.  I agree with Dr Wang  and  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Boon  Wan  that more forecasting and more data  will  be\r\n\r\nuseful.  But I am not optimistic that students and parents at\r\n\r\nthe  point at which they enter university will make  sensible\r\n\r\nlong-term choices for themselves, because, as Dr Wang and  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  have  pointed out, there is a considerable  market  lag.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  looks reasonable now may not be right at the  time\r\n\r\nthat  the students graduate.  For example, students  tend  to\r\n\r\nmove  away from architecture and civil engineering when there\r\n\r\nis  a  downturn in the construction cycle.  That may well  be\r\n\r\nthe   best  time  to  start  taking  architecture  and  civil\r\n\r\nengineering because by the time they finish in four  or  five\r\n\r\nyears' time, that is when the boom may start again.  So it is\r\n\r\na  bit difficult to predict because there are long leads  and\r\n\r\nlags  in the system.  And also we are talking about education\r\n\r\nfor a lifetime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While more forecasting may be useful. I think we should\r\n\r\nreally  be  looking at the longer-term trends and hence,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in our tertiary institutions, we have placed a  high\r\n\r\nemphasis on science and technology.  Because we think that in\r\n\r\nthe  long  term, good foundation and training in science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology  will  actually provide our students  with  a  big\r\n\r\nadvantage  in  being  able to shift  into  other  areas,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  science  and technology is one  of  the  fundamental\r\n\r\ndrivers of the future world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there are limited places for some courses,\r\n\r\nthese  are  guidelines that were drawn  up  by  the  National\r\n\r\nManpower  Committee, and we want to make sure  that  what  we\r\n\r\nexpect  the economy will require is reasonably balanced  with\r\n\r\nthe  output  from  the various faculties.  We  also  have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  certain  faculties do  have  more  demanding\r\n\r\nrequirements at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentry for the students than others.  So not all students  who\r\n\r\ngo  to  university may be able to go to these courses because\r\n\r\nsome  of the courses simply have more demanding requirements,\r\n\r\nand that is a reality which we have to accept.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has suggested that we cap the number of\r\n\r\ndistinctions.   In  fact, it is capped.   Under  the  current\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  system,  we  count  three  \"A\"   level\r\n\r\nsubjects.   So a student who takes more than three \"A\"  level\r\n\r\nsubjects  and scores distinctions for his five,  six,  seven,\r\n\r\neight subjects, if a student has the energy to take that many\r\n\r\n\"A\"  level  subjects, is not going to have those counted  for\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission.   In fact, weightage  is  provided  in\r\n\r\nother areas, like GP and mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new university admission system, as Dr Wang has\r\n\r\nsuggested,  we  will be providing weightage to  co-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities as well.  In order to de-weight the \"A\" levels  so\r\n\r\nthat students do not become overly obsessed with scoring that\r\n\r\nlast  mark  in the \"A\" level examination, we have  introduced\r\n\r\nSAT or a SAT-like test which gives us a different view of the\r\n\r\nstudent's  abilities and readiness to undertake a  university\r\n\r\ncourse.  This is a test which a student can take a number  of\r\n\r\ntimes. So the preparation level and so forth is not quite the\r\n\r\nsame  in  intensity  as taking the \"A\" levels.   The  content\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  is required for a test like that  is  really\r\n\r\nsomething  which  a student should already  have  if  he  has\r\n\r\ncompleted something like his \"O\" levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out at this point that while\r\n\r\nwe  have  spent some time on university education,  there  is\r\n\r\nreally a wide range of high quality further education that is\r\n\r\navailable  and, as Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed out,  we  have\r\n\r\nactually  one  of  the  highest  rates  of  higher  education\r\n\r\nparticipation in the world.  We have over 20% in  university,\r\n\r\n40%  in  the  polytechnics.  Even beyond  that,  for  further\r\n\r\neducation, we have the Institute of  Technical Education.  Mr\r\n\r\nPeter  Chen  has  asked  for  this  booklet  on  ITE   to  be\r\n\r\ndistributed because over the last few months and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  he has got questions even from Members of this  House,\r\n\r\nwhich revealed quite a high level of ignorance as to what ITE\r\n\r\nis  today.  People still think that it is characterised by  a\r\n\r\nvice on the table with people filing away in semi-darkness on\r\n\r\na  greasy  table.   It is quite a different institution  from\r\n\r\nthat today.  The students who go to ITE are highly motivated,\r\n\r\nhaving finished four years in a secondary school, with a good\r\n\r\ngrounding   in  computers,  languages  and  Mathematics   and\r\n\r\nscience.  They are quite well prepared for the future  world.\r\n\r\nIt will be quite a revelation and, if Members are interested,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  Mr Peter Chen will be happy to take  them  on  a\r\n\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I had participated in several\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions  on  compulsory education  both  as  Vice-Chairman  of  the Feedback Panel as well as a member  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Compulsory Education. As we are aware,  the  CCE\r\n\r\nhas  yet  to  complete  its task  and  I  think  it  is  only\r\n\r\nappropriate that we wait for the findings of the Committee to\r\n\r\nbe published before we spend too much time on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, judging from the number of cuts on this\r\n\r\ntopic,  it  is obviously one of public interest.   With  your\r\n\r\nindulgence, Sir, I thought it might be appropriate  to  share\r\n\r\nsome  of  my  observations,  in  particular,  those  of   the\r\n\r\nparticipants  in  the  dialogue  session  organised  by   the\r\n\r\nFeedback Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many Singaporeans are surprised that we have\r\n\r\nnot already made education compulsory in Singapore.  It would\r\n\r\nseem logical for a country like Singapore with its high level\r\n\r\nof education and standard of living and where our  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  hesitate to influence people's behaviour,  through\r\n\r\ncompulsion.   Most agree with my hon. colleague,  Mdm  Claire\r\n\r\nChiang's compassionate plea in Parliament that one child  not\r\n\r\neducated  is  one too many.  Majority polled also  felt  that\r\n\r\nfour  years' compulsory education is too low a number.   Many\r\n\r\nfelt  that  six years is the minimum with 10 years the  ideal\r\n\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among those participants who expressed strong views\r\n\r\nin  these forums are the parents who strongly supported  home\r\n\r\nschooling.   While  I  do not necessarily  agree  with  their\r\n\r\nassertions  about  our education system, I  do  admire  their\r\n\r\ndedication   and   commitment.   They  hold   the   following\r\n\r\nprinciples to be true, which I thought are useful  to  repeat\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, they support compulsory education, ie, the\r\n\r\nState has a right to intervene to ensure the child's right to\r\n\r\nan  education. At the same time, they are also  adamant  that\r\n\r\nthe   parents'  right  of  choice  for  their   children   is\r\n\r\ninalienable.  They are quite insistent that this right is not\r\n\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that so long as the child is educated to an\r\n\r\nagreed standard, the goal of compulsory education would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  met.  Compulsory education legislation  should  provide\r\n\r\noptions  to  allow this.  They do not accept that  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation  means  attending  the  national  education  school\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, most people regardless of their ethnic\r\n\r\nor religious background will support those views.  After all,\r\n\r\ngiving parents the choice cannot be all that bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the course of deliberation in such dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions,  when these arguments were pushed to their  limits,\r\n\r\nmost  participants  ultimately  changed  their  views.   They\r\n\r\nquickly   realised  that  it  is  possible   that   different\r\n\r\ncommunities  in Singapore could set up their own  schools  to\r\n\r\neducate  their  children along their own  ideal  concepts  of\r\n\r\nsocial  and  religious values.  Today, there is  actually  no\r\n\r\nlegal  barrier  for any group to do so.  The main  hurdle  is\r\n\r\nprimarily   financial.   Yet,  Muslim  parents  are   already\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay more when they send their children  to  the\r\n\r\nMadrasah.   As  Singaporeans  become  better  off,  financial\r\n\r\nburden  would become less of a hurdle.  Assuming that is  the\r\n\r\ncase  in the future, then it is possible, as an example, that\r\n\r\nthe  Catholics  would  set up their  own  schools  to  impart\r\n\r\nCatholic  religious values, the Buddhists would do  likewise,\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a multi-racial and multi-religious society like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  this  would plant the seed  of  potential  future\r\n\r\nracial  and  religious conflicts.  Once this possibility  was\r\n\r\nhighlighted,  most  participants in this session  would  move\r\n\r\naway  from  their idealistic position towards a more  central\r\n\r\nposition.  They accept that it is important for all  children\r\n\r\nto  have a common educational experience so that the risk  of\r\n\r\nfragmentation  would be minimised.  Thus,  I  would  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  most  Singaporeans would accept the twin goals  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  education system, namely, to impart  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  so  that  young Singaporeans would become  productive\r\n\r\ncitizens in the future knowledge-based economy and, secondly,\r\n\r\nto develop a common experience to bolster national cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants would come to accept that if we were to\r\n\r\nintroduce compulsory education, then we might as well  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  child is enrolled in the national school education\r\n\r\nsystem.   If  this means usurping the choice of the  parents,\r\n\r\nmost  would  consider it a price worth paying so that  future\r\n\r\ngenerations of Singaporeans can live in peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak) (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Timah GRC, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, mentioned  the\r\n\r\nFeedback  Unit's  dialogue session on  compulsory  education.\r\n\r\nThe  people  who  attended his session were  mainly  English-educated.   I have also conducted a similar feedback  session\r\n\r\nin   Chinese  for  the Chinese-educated.  The attendees  were\r\n\r\nmainly school principals, teachers  and community leaders.  I\r\n\r\nmade a survey.  Their views on compulsory education came to a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  three 100%.  Firstly, 100% of them  supported  the\r\n\r\nview of the Prime Minister to introduce compulsory education.\r\n\r\nSecondly, 100% of the attendees did not agree that compulsory\r\n\r\neducation be implemented up to Primary 4 only. Thirdly,  100%\r\n\r\nof  them  held the view that compulsory education should   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  up  to at least Primary 6, that  is,  PSLE.   In\r\n\r\nfact, about 65% proposed that compulsory education should  be\r\n\r\nimplemented up to \"O\" levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These participants support compulsory education because\r\n\r\nthey  are  concerned that some 1,000 students have  not  been\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  schools  despite all the counselling  and  home\r\n\r\nvisits to the parents to send their children to school.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  cares for  these  children.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we  must  commend.  Some parents  persist  in  not\r\n\r\nsending  their  children  to  school  and  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  cannot  take  any  action  against  them.    These\r\n\r\nchildren  will then be sacrificed as they would  have  missed\r\n\r\nthe  best gift society can give to them in their whole  life.\r\n\r\nIf there is compulsory education, then we can ensure that all\r\n\r\nchildren of school-going age will go to school because  young\r\n\r\nchildren  cannot decide their own fate.  It is only  the  law\r\n\r\nthat  can  give  them the protection and  the  safeguards.  A\r\n\r\ncompulsory  education system has already been established  in\r\n\r\nthe Philippines and the European and Asian countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory education is good for Singapore. But in\r\n\r\nimplementing the system, the Ministry of Education must  also\r\n\r\nconduct  a  study into those parents who do  not  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to school to find out why they have chosen not to do\r\n\r\nso.  Is it because of poverty or because of family disharmony\r\n\r\nor  because the parents themselves have low educational level\r\n\r\nso that they do not care about their children's education?  I\r\n\r\nthink   the  Ministry  of  Community   Development  and   the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development Councils should help these parents  to\r\n\r\nsolve  their problems.  We all know that compulsory education\r\n\r\nup  to primary four is not so ideal because at  primary  four\r\n\r\nthe child is only 10 years old.  The children are still young\r\n\r\nand  they  do  not  know  the consequences  of  not  studying\r\n\r\nfurther.  They would not have enough grounding in English and\r\n\r\ntheir  mother  tongue  to survive in the new  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  For Mathematics, they would be even worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are developing the regional economy and high-tech economy, the children must learn information technology\r\n\r\nso  that they can prepare themselves for the future and  earn\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood. It is a common view that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompulsory  education must be implemented up to  primary  six\r\n\r\nor,  better  still,  secondary four.  As for  those  who  are\r\n\r\nmentally handicapped  and unable to make the grade,  MOE  may\r\n\r\ntreat them as special cases, and deal with them on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compulsory education is introduced, how do we\r\n\r\nensure that the students do not absent themselves from class?\r\n\r\nThis  is important.  I wonder if MOE has considered  engaging\r\n\r\ncounsellors  to  help  the student and, when  necessary,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and parents must also be counselled to ensure  that\r\n\r\ncompulsory education can be implemented properly.   According\r\n\r\nto  my  understanding, counselling is normally  done  by  the\r\n\r\nteachers.  We all know that the teachers have already  had  a\r\n\r\nvery  heavy workload. Do they have enough time and energy  to\r\n\r\ncounsel the students and their parents effectively?  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore   suggest   that   MOE  should   consider   getting\r\n\r\nprofessional counsellors or engage retired teachers  to  work\r\n\r\nas  counsellors.  In this way, counselling would  work   more\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, there is a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying that when drops of water fall on a  piece  of\r\n\r\ngranite  long  enough a dent will be made  on  that  granite.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  analogy is like my quest for compulsory education\r\n\r\nin this House.  Members will know that I have brought up this\r\n\r\nsubject  of  compulsory education year after year during  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate  in  the  Committee of  Supply.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nreporter  in the Straits Times who likens me to an old  horse\r\n\r\nthat trots old ground all the time.  I hope that the reporter\r\n\r\nhas  already  taken note that the old horse trotting  on  old\r\n\r\nground in regard to compulsory education has been successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, agrees with me.\r\n\r\nPM  Goh  announced  last  year  that  Singapore  is  to  have\r\n\r\ncompulsory education.  When he made that announcement  I  was\r\n\r\nin  Parliament  and I was really elated.  However,  I  was  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit disappointed that there was only going to be  four\r\n\r\nyears  of compulsory education. From an educational point  of\r\n\r\nview, four years' compulsory education is definitely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot enough.  Most of those skipping school in the first place\r\n\r\nnormally  come from poor families or parents who are probably\r\n\r\nthemselves illiterate or lowly educated.  Most likely,  those\r\n\r\nchildren  are slow learners or have some kind of  a  problem.\r\n\r\nTherefore, four years of compulsory education is not  enough.\r\n\r\nEven  the  Jesuits require six years to train a child  to  be\r\n\r\nwhat you want the child to be.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six years of compulsory education would probably be\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  period to keep a child in school to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  he learns the 3Rs.  I believe that from the educational\r\n\r\npoint  of  view, the child is best kept in school  for  eight\r\n\r\nyears.  Eight years would certainly give a better chance  for\r\n\r\nan  average or even below average child to learn the 3Rs.   I\r\n\r\npersonally  favour eight years' compulsory education  to  let\r\n\r\nthe child stay in school up to age 14.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1973, I had the opportunity to teach in a school\r\n\r\nin  London for a very short period of time.  I was posted  to\r\n\r\ntake  care of 15-year olds.  At that time, England had a  10-year  compulsory  education  programme.   They  forced  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to remain in school up to age 16.  I can  say  from\r\n\r\nexperience that 10 years' compulsory education does not work.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a complete waste of time and money.  What happens  is\r\n\r\nthat those pupils in their last year of school at age 15 just\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  learn.  They know they want to leave school,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are not allowed to.  They know that they are forced  to\r\n\r\nbe  in school by law.  They are restless.  The teacher cannot\r\n\r\nteach  them  anything.  So they are brought to  the  hall  to\r\n\r\nwatch movies on social issues.  But as soon as they return to\r\n\r\nthe class, they are noisy and rowdy.  It is difficult to keep\r\n\r\nthem  occupied.  Maintaining discipline is a problem.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot want such a situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that a Committee has been set up\r\n\r\nto look into compulsory education.  I hope that the Committee\r\n\r\nshall  not  recommend  four years but  at  least  six  years'\r\n\r\ncompulsory education and eight years, if possible.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat eight years of compulsory education is the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  then  the children shall be given a real  chance  to\r\n\r\nmaster the basics in reading, writing and arithmetic.  For 10\r\n\r\nyears,   I   have  mentioned  the  problems.   If  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation is fixed at only six years, I am afraid that  there\r\n\r\nmay be wastage.  Money is spent on keeping children in school\r\n\r\nbut  they learn nothing when they leave school at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe six years in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the Committee shall recommend to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to set up a section to monitor the children who\r\n\r\nhave not been attending school to find out their problems and\r\n\r\ntry  to assist them to ensure that they do go to school.  The\r\n\r\nmode of operation for this section in the Ministry should  be\r\n\r\nbased  more  on  counselling  rather  than  on  threats   and\r\n\r\npunishment.   Therefore, the Government needs to  train  good\r\n\r\ncounsellors to deal both with family problems and truancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, after listening to Mr Chiam, I am\r\n\r\nnot  so sure whether he is arguing against himself that there\r\n\r\nare  problems  in  compulsory education,  regardless  of  the\r\n\r\nlength of time, and therefore should it be made compulsory at\r\n\r\nall.  Because if you have problems with 10 years, you suggest\r\n\r\neight;  and  you have got problems at eight years,  you  move\r\n\r\ndown  to six; then to four, what have you got left?  So I  am\r\n\r\nnot very sure whether if you have difficulty, you should make\r\n\r\nit compulsory at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of compulsory education first arose in\r\n\r\nthis  House  when  some  Members learned  that  a  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  were  not  attending school  because  of  financial\r\n\r\nhardships and parental neglect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, a formal Committee has been set up. Dr\r\n\r\nAline  Wong has been appointed as the Chairman. The scope  of\r\n\r\nstudy  has  now widened.  It has now to define  clearly  what\r\n\r\ncompulsory education should entail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If compulsory education is intended to ensure that every\r\n\r\nchild is taught and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared for later adult life, it is an easy matter  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith.  However, if compulsory education is to include how the\r\n\r\nchild should be taught and have the effect of insisting  that\r\n\r\nevery  child must attend formal schooling in our schools,  it\r\n\r\nis a different matter.  We know how delicate and sensitive it\r\n\r\nis  if we were to require students currently studying in  the\r\n\r\nMadrasah to switch to our national schools.  However,  should\r\n\r\nwe  continue to segregate these students from the  mainstream\r\n\r\neducational  system?   For  what they  are  learning  in  the\r\n\r\nMadrasah, are the students well prepared in the long term  to\r\n\r\nwork and live in a multi-racial Singaporean society?  If  the\r\n\r\ndecision  has  to  be made for the long-term  good  of  these\r\n\r\nMadrasah  students, then a way has to be found to  handle  it\r\n\r\ncarefully  by persuading the parents concerned and the  Malay\r\n\r\nleaders  and community to have them switched to the  national\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a small number of parents who believe in\r\n\r\nteaching  their own children themselves in the home  setting.\r\n\r\nThey  have their own reasons for deciding that their children\r\n\r\nare  better taught and brought up themselves.  Some of  these\r\n\r\nparents are themselves well educated with strong academic and\r\n\r\nprofessional qualifications.  They feel that the  educational\r\n\r\nsystem  does  not  tailor to the gifts  and  needs  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   The question I wish to ask is whether  we  should\r\n\r\ninsist  that parents could no longer be given the  option  of\r\n\r\nhome schooling for their children.  From time to time, we  do\r\n\r\nhear  university professors having a child prodigy and making\r\n\r\ngeniuses  out of their children, and one child not  attending\r\n\r\nschool  against another child prodigy that you can  bring  up\r\n\r\ndifferently.  I think there is also this consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many children with disabilities and in need of special\r\n\r\neducation are not attending school for a variety of  reasons.\r\n\r\nBy  making education compulsory, the beneficiaries  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  disabled children.  In so doing, adequate resources will\r\n\r\nbe  provided.  The parents will have to be assisted  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir children to school and not lose out the opportunity for\r\n\r\nspecial education.  With compulsory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation,  is  the  society ready to deploy  proportionately\r\n\r\nmore   resources  to  equip  these  children  to  cope   with\r\n\r\nindependent living?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans are working overseas, and with each\r\n\r\nchange  of posting there are disruptions to the education  of\r\n\r\ntheir  children.  With compulsory education, we  must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our schools cater to these students who receive part  of\r\n\r\ntheir education overseas and in institutions with a different\r\n\r\neducational  system from ours.  How do we ensure  that  these\r\n\r\nchildren  who  are  brought  up in  a  different  educational\r\n\r\nenvironment are accommodated into our system?  Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nrun the risk of losing these children who might not return to\r\n\r\nSingapore for their education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, in the early days of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  the  majority of our people were  poor.   Families\r\n\r\nwere  large.  Children, when enrolled into Primary  One,  had\r\n\r\nfew if any pre-school education.  As a result, we all learned\r\n\r\nour ABC together.  Today, the situation is quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every child at the entrance to Primary One would have\r\n\r\ntaken  at  least two years of kindergarten; majority attended\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Community Foundation (PCF) kindergartens.  For those\r\n\r\nwho  attended non-PCF kindergartens, they would have attended\r\n\r\nprogrammes based on other pedagogical principles.   Thus,  on\r\n\r\none  end  of  the scale, we have children who are  very  well\r\n\r\nschooled  in reading and writing; on the other end,  children\r\n\r\nwho have very little basis at all.  This state of affairs was\r\n\r\nreported in the Straits Times recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Ministry is: How does the school\r\n\r\ncater  to  different capabilities of the children at  Primary\r\n\r\nOne?   How  does the school assign them to different classes?\r\n\r\nDo they go through a grading process?  What is the assumption\r\n\r\nof the education level of the children at entry to P1?  Is it\r\n\r\npegged too low or too high?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that most children have attended two years\r\n\r\nof PCF kindergarten.  Presumably, the PCF has a common set of\r\n\r\ncurriculum for all its kindergartens.  Thus,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonce the PCF kindergartens are brought to a set of consistent\r\n\r\nstandards,  it  would  appear that the problem  of  different\r\n\r\nstandards  of various kindergartens would have by  and  large\r\n\r\nbeen contained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some educationists consider pre-school to be\r\n\r\njust as important, if not more important, than the first  few\r\n\r\nyears of primary education.  For some higher income families,\r\n\r\nparents would have sent their children to private pre-schools\r\n\r\nwhere  more individualised attention is possible.  Of course,\r\n\r\nthese   parents  are  prepared  to  pay  for  the  privilege,\r\n\r\nsometimes  ranging from $300 per month upwards.   I  remember\r\n\r\nseveral parents who approached me expressing fear that  their\r\n\r\nchildren are so far advanced that they would be bored and de-motivated  if  their children are enrolled into Primary  One.\r\n\r\nThey  would  prefer to have their children  enrolled  into  a\r\n\r\nhigher level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our education system is built on an egalitarian\r\n\r\nprinciple that all children, rich or poor, must be given  the\r\n\r\nsame educational opportunity.  Yet, it is beginning to emerge\r\n\r\nthat  not  all children beginning their Primary One education\r\n\r\nare  studying  from  the same starting  line.   If  we  truly\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  giving  children the same headstart,  we  should\r\n\r\nstart  thinking about subsidising pre-schools so that quality\r\n\r\nteachers can be hired and engaged for these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also aware that MOE has given up the idea of\r\n\r\nextending primary school into pre-primary after experimenting\r\n\r\nwith it several years ago.  However, I would like to find out\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministry whether it is prepared to draft a  set  of\r\n\r\ncurriculum  for  all pre-primary schools and our  pre-schools\r\n\r\nand  provide  some sort of subsidies to all these pre-schools\r\n\r\nthat conform to the curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving from pre-school to primary school, in terms of\r\n\r\nschool   fees,  today  the  child  pays  $12  per   year   as\r\n\r\nsupplementary  fees for primary schools.  For  those  parents\r\n\r\nwho  have  been  paying more for their children's  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation, I believe many would not mind continuing to pay at\r\n\r\nthat level.  Yet, because they do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot have to do so, they continue to spend the same budget  on\r\n\r\nadditional enrichment programmes and engaging private  tutors\r\n\r\nonce  their  children  enter primary  school.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  desirable  as  the  children  end  up   spending\r\n\r\nadditional time in private tuition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: Is it possible that our primary school\r\n\r\nsystem   has  become  too  egalitarian?   There   were   some\r\n\r\npreliminary discussions on allowing a few selected schools to\r\n\r\ngo  independent.  I would like to find out from the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether this scheme has moved one step further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, pre-school education is not\r\n\r\nfunded by the Government.  Though the Government is providing\r\n\r\n$39  million  in  FY2000  for the  development  of  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  through  the Ministry of Community  Development  and\r\n\r\nSports, no significant amount is provided for by the Ministry\r\n\r\nto spend on pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small mention under the Education Programmes\r\n\r\nDivision  stating that it plans, monitors and regulates  pre-school  and  special  school  education.   If  anything,  the\r\n\r\nworkload  and  performance  indicator  shows  a  decline   in\r\n\r\ncommitment for pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this is not reflective of the intention of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education.  The moulding of the child starts at a\r\n\r\nvery  early  age.   It  is important  that  the  infants  and\r\n\r\ntoddlers are well taken care of and be properly prepared  for\r\n\r\nformal schooling when they enter primary school.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Community Foundation is the largest provider of\r\n\r\nkindergarten education in Singapore. We, PAP MPs,  are  proud\r\n\r\nin  making  kindergarten  education affordable  to  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of HDB residents, especially the children from lower-income  families.   Of course, times have  changed.  We  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  computer  courses and music in  our  kindergarten\r\n\r\ncurricula. At times, it is a challenge to convince\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents of the change and that education is an area best left\r\n\r\nto the educational experts and professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, because of the pace of growth and development\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  and  the expectations of Singaporean  parents\r\n\r\nhave gone up manifold, it is time that we reviewed how we can\r\n\r\nupgrade and develop pre-school education to higher levels  of\r\n\r\nperformance.  It is now time for the Education Ministry to be\r\n\r\nproactive to ensure that the desirable outcomes are spelt out\r\n\r\nand   accomplished  for  children  going  through  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now a wide variety of sources and institutions\r\n\r\nproviding   early  childhood  education.  Should  not   these\r\n\r\nestablishments be properly certified with stringent standards\r\n\r\nimposed? Should not the Ministry be interested to ensure that\r\n\r\nonly good teachers are teaching in these institutions for pre-schoolers?    Our   review  would   have   the   benefit   of\r\n\r\nstrengthening the delivery system of pre-school education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the  benefit  of  our  children  in  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, a recent report in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  showed  that there  is  a  disparity  in  the\r\n\r\nstandards   of   pre-school  education  in  Singapore.   This\r\n\r\ndisparity  is  most evident in the extent to  which  children\r\n\r\nhave  been  prepared  for formal education  in  schools.  The\r\n\r\nreport  indicated that some children have already  covered  a\r\n\r\nmajor  part  of  their primary 1 syllabus by  the  time  they\r\n\r\nentered  school.  On the other hand, some children  are  just\r\n\r\nbeginning to get down to the basics of their English Language\r\n\r\nat  primary  1,  even  though they have  attended  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite naturally, some concerns arose in relation to the\r\n\r\ndivergence  of standards amongst pre-schoolers in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Education Ministry said that they were looking into this\r\n\r\narea   by  specifying  clearer  indications  on  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcomes of pre-school education here. For the moment,  I  am\r\n\r\ngiven  to understand that our Government's position has  been\r\n\r\nto  leave pre-school education to the private sector, and not\r\n\r\nto take over this task. As a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresult of leaving it to the private sector, standards for pre-school  education vary, not just to the extent of the ability\r\n\r\nof the child on entering primary school, but also the quality\r\n\r\nof  pre-school education and the teachers. Besides, the  fees\r\n\r\nalso  differ from kindergarten to kindergarten.  Despite  the\r\n\r\ndifferences  in standard, I accept that pre-school  education\r\n\r\nshould,  at  the moment, continue to remain with the  private\r\n\r\nsector. There is no reason why the Government should now step\r\n\r\nin  to  take over that responsibility.  Besides, there is  no\r\n\r\nreal  evidence that kindergartens are generally not doing  an\r\n\r\nadequate job of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is, however, something to be said of the role\r\n\r\nof  Government in setting clearer guidelines and standards in\r\n\r\nthis  area. The Government's guidelines should cover not only\r\n\r\nteaching methodology and curriculum, but also the standard of\r\n\r\nadministration, recruitment and training of teachers. In  the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  I am not too confident  that  even  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to set clear guidelines on what the child  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to know from pre-school education, there would  not\r\n\r\nbe  differing abilities among children in primary 1.  Parents\r\n\r\noften contribute to the intense competition by wanting to  be\r\n\r\nahead  of  their  peers in schools. The  common  response  of\r\n\r\nparents   from  recent  interviews  states  that  primary   1\r\n\r\nstandards  are tough and for that reason, their children  are\r\n\r\nover-prepared  for  primary school.  I am  afraid  I  do  not\r\n\r\nfollow the logic of that reasoning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If primary 1 standard is tough, how does over-preparing\r\n\r\nhelp?  Should  not  the approach be to mentally  prepare  the\r\n\r\nchild to deal with the tough syllabus ahead by cultivating  a\r\n\r\nmore enquiring mind? Setting expectations of the abilities of\r\n\r\nchildren  on  entering primary school  is  not  the  same  as\r\n\r\nrequiring   them  to  cover  the  primary   1   syllabus   in\r\n\r\nkindergarten.  Unfortunately, that is the  expectation  of  a\r\n\r\nfair  number  of parents. Somehow, there is a sense  of  one-upmanship  for  parents whose children are able  to  do  book\r\n\r\nreviews  at primary 1.  Is this ability really necessary  and\r\n\r\nexpected of a child at that level, or is it to give the child\r\n\r\nor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents a certain sense of superior ability over the rest?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, I would like to say something of the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  PCF.   We know that the PCF is  presently  the\r\n\r\nlargest provider of pre-school education in Singapore.  Since\r\n\r\nits   inception,  the  PCF  has  provided  Singaporeans  with\r\n\r\naffordable   pre-school  education.   Many   generations   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  benefited greatly from it.   By  all  accounts,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason to believe that PCF does not  adequately\r\n\r\nprepare  the child for primary education, although  I  cannot\r\n\r\nquite  say that they prepare the child to write book  reviews\r\n\r\nat primary 1 too. The Government believes that they are doing\r\n\r\na  good  job. At my PCF centre, we track the progress of  our\r\n\r\nchildren  at primary 1 as of this year.  I have no reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the children are not doing fine.  The PCF  even\r\n\r\nhas   its  own  training  institute  to  prepare  and   train\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers.  PCF  centres  are  generally   well-managed,  and  I would say that they are even better-equipped\r\n\r\nthan  some  of the privately run kindergartens in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany PCF centres undergo constant upgrading and renovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, PCF suffers from the effects of snob\r\n\r\nappeal.   Many up-only mobile parents do not think  that  the\r\n\r\nPCF  is  good  enough  for their children.   I  suspect  this\r\n\r\nprejudice may have to do with the fact that the PCF is rooted\r\n\r\nin the HDB heartland or maybe because the PCF is not charging\r\n\r\nexorbitant  sums to have that gilt-edge or maybe it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  PCF  does  not teach the children  to  write  book\r\n\r\nreviews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to be realistic. At the end of the day, one has\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  question  whether pre-school  education  is  to\r\n\r\nprepare  a child to undertake primary education or is  it  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  he  or  she  is  ahead  of  his  peers  at  the\r\n\r\ncommencement  of school.  If we honestly ask  ourselves,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is obvious. Even if the Government clearly  sets  the\r\n\r\nexpectations  of desired outcomes in preparing  a  child  for\r\n\r\nschool,  there will be many, many kiasu parents who  want  to\r\n\r\nplay the one-upmanship game. When it comes to this, I am sure\r\n\r\nthat there are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany centres who will continue to respond to their demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, allow me to share my experience as the\r\n\r\nfather of a child about to enter pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is literally a bewildering array of options open\r\n\r\nto  parents. There is something for every budget, from a  few\r\n\r\ntens  of  dollar a month up to a thousand dollars or  more  a\r\n\r\nmonth  and, at the higher end, it is, in fact, more expensive\r\n\r\nthan  university education in some cases. There is  something\r\n\r\nfor  every form of pedagogic persuasion.  There are some  who\r\n\r\nemphasise the traditional 3Rs, that is, reading, writing  and\r\n\r\narithmetic. There are others who propose and propagate  self-directed learning. Some emphasise more on the mother  tongue.\r\n\r\nOthers  emphasise more on the English language. In  terms  of\r\n\r\nfacilities,  the  array  is  again  quite  vast.   You   have\r\n\r\nkindergartens  in  void  decks, you have  them  in  converted\r\n\r\nlanded  properties  and you have some customised  facilities.\r\n\r\nSuch  diversity is desirable for it gives parents  a  choice.\r\n\r\nBut  the  process  of analysing this information  and  making\r\n\r\ninformed decisions is worthy of a thesis in my view.  Because\r\n\r\nparents in general have some difficulty in ascertaining  what\r\n\r\nexactly is desired in pre-school education.  I for one do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  subject  my child to the rigours  of  writing  book\r\n\r\nreviews,  if  that  is  not necessary,  and  indeed  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  the child will acquire in  the  fullness  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if this is a requirement or there is\r\n\r\nsome  expectation from the primary 1 school  level  that  the\r\n\r\nchild  should have certain minimum capabilities in this area,\r\n\r\nI  would  wish  to  know about it because  that  would  be  a\r\n\r\ncriterion in deciding which centre I choose for my child.  My\r\n\r\npurpose here is not to absolve parents of decision-making  on\r\n\r\nthe all important choice of where to send their child for pre-school  or,  for  that  matter, primary or  secondary  school\r\n\r\neducation.   My purpose is more to ask whether  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncan be more proactive and helpful to parents in making those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoices.   My  colleagues, who have spoken  before  me,  have\r\n\r\nhighlighted several of these points.  I wish to add a few key\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, basically, to know what is the desired outcome of\r\n\r\npre-primary education. If we know what the hurdle is, then we\r\n\r\nknow how hard to train to clear the hurdle.  Second, can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  be  less reticent about what form of curriculum  it\r\n\r\nthinks will best serve that desired outcome? I think it would\r\n\r\nnot be unappreciated by parents if they have an idea from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education on what curriculum structure it  thinks\r\n\r\nwill meet the basic requirements in preparation for P1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry go a little bit further and in fact\r\n\r\nundertake  certification to reassure parents that  regardless\r\n\r\nof  where  the school or the kindergarten resides, regardless\r\n\r\nof  the  teacher-pupil ratio and regardless of the  pedagogic\r\n\r\nmethod,  a  certain minimum standard is being  met  and  that\r\n\r\nparents can confidently enrol the child there without concern\r\n\r\nthat the child may not be getting what is appropriate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can the Ministry allocate more resources\r\n\r\ntowards  research in this area, in order to ascertain clearly\r\n\r\nin  our minds the value of pre-primary education and if it is\r\n\r\nfound to be valuable, then let us take a step further and say\r\n\r\nwe will accord adequate public funding to ensure that this is\r\n\r\ndone properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to that is the question of the training of\r\n\r\nour teachers. The quality of pre-school teachers is extremely\r\n\r\nwide. These issues come to the heart of one main problem that\r\n\r\na lot of parents face, which is, the contrast is stark in the\r\n\r\nterrain  between pre-primary education and primary education.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  enter  primary school, the choice is quite  simple.\r\n\r\nYou  choose the school, but you know in general that they are\r\n\r\nwithin  certain  boundaries and your child is being  prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the  Primary School Leaving Examinations. But  when  you\r\n\r\nenter  pre-primary education, it is not very clear  what  you\r\n\r\nare preparing the child for.  You know that there is this  P1\r\n\r\nhurdle  but  we  do not know what exactly it  represents.   I\r\n\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrateful  if  the Ministry could comment further  on  how  it\r\n\r\nproposes to assist parents in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just ask hon. Members to try to\r\n\r\nshorten their speeches because we still got a lot of speakers\r\n\r\non  this amendment and we have three other amendments to take\r\n\r\nbefore we reach \"guillotine\" time, which is slightly over  an\r\n\r\nhour away.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nshare  some  of the views by Mr Iswaran and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nthink  that  adopting a more national standard in pre-primary\r\n\r\neducation would be one answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to raise two concerns of mine here\r\n\r\ntoday.  First,  as Members have spoken, leaving  the  current\r\n\r\nsystem  of  pre-primary  education entirely  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  has brought about some vastly different outcomes  and\r\n\r\nit  certainly  must be the case as reflected in some  surveys\r\n\r\nand articles in the Straits Times.  Because different schools\r\n\r\nadopt  different teaching methods and the philosophy  towards\r\n\r\nlearning,  have  different curriculum and facilities,  charge\r\n\r\ndifferent   fees,  provide  different  moral  and   religious\r\n\r\nfoundation.    Some   provided   more   enjoyable    learning\r\n\r\nexperience, while others put children through a more rigorous\r\n\r\npreparation  for  primary 1 with examinations,  homework  and\r\n\r\ntests.   Certainly, these different exposures and experiences\r\n\r\nwill  produce different outcomes.  Yet, they are all expected\r\n\r\nto go to primary 1 where the students will be introduced to a\r\n\r\nmore  standard national education programme and I think  more\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  to  ensure  a  smoother  and  more  consistent\r\n\r\ntransition from pre-school to primary 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and this is my deep concern, I observe a growing\r\n\r\ntrend  of  religious and ethnic based organisations providing\r\n\r\npre-primary  education, either as a  social  service  or  for\r\n\r\ncommercial purposes.  Most parents have legitimate reasons to\r\n\r\nwant  to  send their children to such schools.  They want  to\r\n\r\ngive their children a very strong foundation in religious and\r\n\r\nmoral\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  from the very young.  However, others,  especially\r\n\r\nMalay    and   Indian   parents,   quite   frequently    cite\r\n\r\nunavailability of Malay and Tamil as second language in  some\r\n\r\nkindergartens  as  one  of  the  reasons  for  sending  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  a  school  run by ethnic  and  religious  based\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons, these are worrying trends because\r\n\r\nthe  very  success of this may result in, and hopefully  not,\r\n\r\npre-primary  education  being delivered  predominantly  along\r\n\r\nethnic  and  religious lines.  I fear that even at  the  very\r\n\r\nyoung  and  early  age, this may result  in  children  having\r\n\r\nconflicting  perceptions  of values,  cultures  and  separate\r\n\r\ngroups.   Should we not plant a strong foundation  of  multi-cultural education beginning at pre-school education?  And as\r\n\r\nthis  would  involve parents also, I think a more  culturally\r\n\r\nintegrated  pre-school  programme  can  help  develop  better\r\n\r\nawareness  of  cultural perceptions, biases,  prejudices  and\r\n\r\nstereotypes, even amongst parents.  I am therefore asking the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  really consider a national  standard  for  pre-primary education.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while running kindergartens can be left entirely to\r\n\r\nthe  private sector, they should not be left entirely to  set\r\n\r\ntheir  own  standards  and agenda.  A recent  Straits  Times'\r\n\r\nsurvey shows that while more than 60% of parents do not  want\r\n\r\nGovernment to take over pre-school education, amongst  Malays\r\n\r\nand  Indians,  more preferred that the Government  made  pre-primary  education part of the national education system,  as\r\n\r\nthey feel that the Government would be the best placed agency\r\n\r\nto  make this a more level playing field.  Otherwise, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue with the perception that the better schools charging\r\n\r\nhigher  fees  provide  a  better  system  of  education   and\r\n\r\ntherefore if you have more money, you can better prepare your\r\n\r\nchildren for primary one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, we must maintain flexibility and variety that\r\n\r\nthe  private market offers.  There will always be better  and\r\n\r\nmore expensive schools which parents can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoose  from.  But the bottom line must remain that  even  if\r\n\r\nparents  can afford only the cheapest, they must and  can  be\r\n\r\nassured  that all schools have the resources and  ability  to\r\n\r\nadequately prepare children for primary one education.   This\r\n\r\nis  an assurance that we can give to all parents.  But to  do\r\n\r\nthat, we need to ensure standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of a few areas where the Ministry can\r\n\r\nenforce  standards to conduct audits and ensure that  schools\r\n\r\nare  meeting  the  requirements.  One,  for  example,  is  in\r\n\r\nqualification and competency of teachers.  The  Ministry  can\r\n\r\ndecide what are basic skills that teachers should have,  what\r\n\r\nare  the  minimum requirements before someone  can  become  a\r\n\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I can now address the Minister of State on\r\n\r\nthis matter, as I notice the Minister has left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli, could you continue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Second, is on syllabus and\r\n\r\ncurriculum, whether the syllabus has the right combination of\r\n\r\nacademic content, play and creative aspects, social skills to\r\n\r\nbuild  confidence.   We can provide a basic  core  curriculum\r\n\r\nthat  must be very important, but I think we can also provide\r\n\r\nflexibility  where schools can be left to  choose  their  own\r\n\r\nelective subjects.  Thirdly, is racial composition.   I  come\r\n\r\nback to this point again.  I think this is so very important.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  survey shows that parents do not rank  mixing  with\r\n\r\nother  races  as  very  important, but  it  is  important  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is important to us that we cannot  leave  it\r\n\r\ncompletely  to  free choice.  And if it has  to  be  ensured,\r\n\r\nencouraged  or  enforced, then we have to do so.   So  nobody\r\n\r\nshould  just  set up a school predominantly for a  particular\r\n\r\nethnic group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the teaching of second language, this is quite\r\n\r\nserious  sometimes, because what do you do when you have  one\r\n\r\nIndian or Malay student in the school?  Do you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemploy  a  Malay teacher and say, \"Fine, it is  going  to  be\r\n\r\nexpensive to teach you.\"  Or you invest and say, \"Fine,  this\r\n\r\nis   something  you  are  committed  to.   Let's  find  other\r\n\r\nstudents.\"  Or send them to some nearby schools without  much\r\n\r\nof  a problem, but still assure them that they can get second\r\n\r\nlanguage education, even in pre-school.  I think here I  feel\r\n\r\na  more  coordinated effort can better address this.  My  own\r\n\r\nvision  really,  if I could share with this  House,  is  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  with CDCs wanting to take more and more  roles,  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  could provide the facilities where these various ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups can provide education under one roof.  They can go  to\r\n\r\ntheir  ethnic-based  schools, but when  it  comes  to  common\r\n\r\nsubjects, whether to share computers, playground, music, they\r\n\r\ncan  have common experiences.  And then they can go  back  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own respective class where they can have religious  or\r\n\r\nlanguage education.  But at the end of the day, we can and we\r\n\r\nshould  provide,  even at the very young, a  very  integrated\r\n\r\nexperience,  so  that  our  long-term  objective  of   racial\r\n\r\nintegration   cannot  be  hampered  by   racial   or   ethnic\r\n\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nEducation,  Dr  Aline  Wong, had,  in  a  recent  sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  spoken about the cross curricular approach  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry takes for the delivery of sex education in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   Dr  Wong mentioned that the schools  tap  resource\r\n\r\nspeakers  from  external  agencies,  such  as  MOH  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Planned Parenthood Association, to conduct  talks,\r\n\r\ncourses   and   seminars  relating  to   the   subject.    My\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  however, is that the  primary  responsibility\r\n\r\nstill  lies with teachers assigned to the subject in schools.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these  teachers  are most uncomfortable  with  this\r\n\r\nassignment.   May I ask the Minister if it  might  not  be  a\r\n\r\nbetter  approach to source out the teaching of sex  education\r\n\r\naltogether  in an organised and structured way with  a  well-defined curriculum to agencies or organisations who would  be\r\n\r\nable  to assign trained and qualified instructors, who  would\r\n\r\nbe far more comfortable and skilled in undertaking this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, let me reply to those points on pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  first.   The  recent surge  of  interest  in  this\r\n\r\nsector,  shall we use the abbreviated form of  PSE  for  pre-school  education,  has come about partly because,  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  decade or so, there has been some research,  especially\r\n\r\nbrain   research,   which  suggests  exciting   possibilities\r\n\r\nespecially   in   non-cognitive  development   and   language\r\n\r\nacquisition  that  PSE  can bring  to  children.    This  has\r\n\r\nprompted the public as well as the press and parliamentarians\r\n\r\nalike to urge greater MOE involvement in this sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On past occasions, I have stated in this House my\r\n\r\nposition on PSE.  I think it must be cautioned that, taken as\r\n\r\na  whole,  the  findings are by no means  conclusive.   While\r\n\r\nthere  is  some  evidence that PSE provides a learning  head-start, there is also countervailing evidence showing that the\r\n\r\nbenefits  wear off after some time.  In fact, it  is  unclear\r\n\r\ntoday  whether PSE brings sustained benefits, ie,  well  into\r\n\r\nelementary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been calls in the press for MOE to pump\r\n\r\nin  more  money into this sector.  But I think simply pouring\r\n\r\nmoney  into PSE will not raise quality automatically.  It  is\r\n\r\nbetter for us to carefully decide how to deploy resources  so\r\n\r\nthat most children can get the most value out of PSE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is my Ministry's response to the research\r\n\r\nfindings?   We  will  look at them more closely  and  explore\r\n\r\ntheir  relevance to the local context.  In MOE's Addendum  to\r\n\r\nthe  President's Address last year, we announced that we will\r\n\r\nbe  more involved in PSE, paying particular attention to high\r\n\r\nleverage   areas   like   defining  outcomes,   designing   a\r\n\r\ndevelopmentally-appropriate  curriculum,  training  teachers,\r\n\r\nconducting research and improving our regulatory framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step must be to delineate the outcomes desired\r\n\r\nof  PSE, in order to lend focus to our efforts and direct our\r\n\r\nattention  to  what is most crucial.  Mr  Loh  Meng  See,  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran and Mr Zulkifli\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaharudin have all asked what MOE wants to achieve by PSE.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to inform the House that the Steering Committee  on\r\n\r\nPSE, which I chair, has come up with the Desired Outcomes  of\r\n\r\nPSE.   It is a comprehensive, yet succinct, list of the  end-objectives  of  PSE  and  this  has  been  put  together   in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with professionals, practitioners  and  policy-makers.    May  I  ask  the Clerk of Parliament  to  help  me\r\n\r\ndistribute the sheet of paper containing the Desired Outcomes\r\n\r\nof PSE.  [Document distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that the Desired Outcomes of PSE\r\n\r\nclosely  mirrors MOE's desired outcomes of education for  the\r\n\r\nother levels, ie, primary, secondary and JC levels.  This  is\r\n\r\ndeliberate, so as to ensure a continuity of focus from PSE to\r\n\r\nprimary  one.   After all, learning is  a  continuum.   As  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of  outcomes  reflecting  values,  attitudes   and\r\n\r\nskills, there is no mention of specific competencies  in  the\r\n\r\n3Rs   -   reading,  writing and arithmetic.  Again,  this  is\r\n\r\ndeliberate, as we want to emphasise that PSE should be  about\r\n\r\npreparing  children for life-long learning, and  not  just  a\r\n\r\npreparation for primary one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current practice of some kindergartens offering\r\n\r\nparts of the primary one curriculum needs to be re-looked at.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that we should not teach the 3Rs.  Indeed, it\r\n\r\nis  most unnatural to designate the first day of primary  one\r\n\r\nas   the   beginning  of  reading,  writing  and   arithmetic\r\n\r\neducation.  What I am saying is that there are important pre-reading,  pre-writing and pre-arithmetic skills to be  learnt\r\n\r\nbefore a child can read, write and do sums.  We need to  give\r\n\r\nadequate attention to these critical fundamentals.  Moreover,\r\n\r\na  child's  motivation  and  interest  in  learning  must  be\r\n\r\nnurtured  from  this tender age.  We must fire his  curiosity\r\n\r\nand  his  sense of wonder.  He needs to learn  in  fun  ways,\r\n\r\nthrough  play, art, music and movement.  Feeding him  with  a\r\n\r\ncurriculum that he is not ready for may raise his performance\r\n\r\nin primary school or at primary one, but this may also dampen\r\n\r\nhis  love for learning which will severely affect success  in\r\n\r\nschool in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press recently reported the case of one primary\r\n\r\nschool  requiring  children  entering  primary  one  to  have\r\n\r\nalready  learnt to read and spell about 100 words.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure the House that this is an extreme case,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the practice is not widespread.  MOE's policy  is  that\r\n\r\nschools  will take in primary one pupils with varying degrees\r\n\r\nof  readiness and teach them from there.  In regular meetings\r\n\r\nwith principals, MOE has reminded schools of this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desired outcomes will be translated into a new\r\n\r\ncurriculum  which  will  provide  age  appropriate   learning\r\n\r\nactivities  in  five  domains, ie, moral, cognitive,  social,\r\n\r\nemotional and physical domains.  This new curriculum will  be\r\n\r\nready  in  about  half  a year's time.   We  will  teach  the\r\n\r\nchildren  what  is  right and wrong.   Cognitively,  children\r\n\r\nshould   learn   through   discovery,   experimentation   and\r\n\r\nobservation.   Language learning will  focus  on  aural,  ie,\r\n\r\nlistening,   and  oral,  ie,  speaking,  skills.    Socially,\r\n\r\nchildren  will  learn to listen attentively, share  and  work\r\n\r\ntogether.  Emotionally, they will develop self-confidence and\r\n\r\nbe  able  to relate to others, to their peers and to  adults.\r\n\r\nActivities will also help children develop their physical co-ordination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that the new curriculum\r\n\r\nwill  help  to ensure a smooth transition for young  children\r\n\r\nfrom  pre-school to primary one.  In designing the curriculum\r\n\r\nfor  primary one, MOE will start from the desired outcome \"Be\r\n\r\nable  to  listen and speak with understanding\".  There  is  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  focus  in  primary one,  particularly  in  English,\r\n\r\nbecause  this is the medium of instruction and the  means  by\r\n\r\nwhich  students  access  most  subjects  in  the  curriculum.\r\n\r\nPupils entering primary one do differ in English proficiency,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their different abilities and backgrounds.   For\r\n\r\nthose with basic oral and aural proficiency, the primary  one\r\n\r\ncurriculum  will  build on that.  For those with  no  English\r\n\r\nfacility, schools will focus on the development of the  aural\r\n\r\nand   oral  skills  first,  and  early  reading  and  writing\r\n\r\nactivities will be gradually phased in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have remarked on the different standards of\r\n\r\nvarious PSE centres.  I think this is natural, given that the\r\n\r\ncommunity   and  private  sectors  provide  PSE,  and   MOE's\r\n\r\nregulatory  role is in setting guidelines on  curriculum  and\r\n\r\nteacher-training.  Many people want MOE to bring children  to\r\n\r\nthe  same starting point at primary one.  While this is well-intentioned,  in  reality, it is impossible.   Children  have\r\n\r\ndifferent abilities and aptitudes, and their home backgrounds\r\n\r\nvary.   It  is unrealistic to expect that they will turn  out\r\n\r\nthe  same  just because they have been through the same  pre-school  programme  for  one  or  two  years.   Even  students\r\n\r\nattending exactly the same pre-school class will come  to  P1\r\n\r\nwith  different levels of preparedness and proficiency. Also,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann has put it so eloquently,  there  will\r\n\r\nalways  be parents who try to give their children that  extra\r\n\r\nhead-start in PSE over their peers.  Children, especially  at\r\n\r\nthis  age  of  rapid growth, are different. They  develop  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  rates and in different ways. We cannot  \"equalise\"\r\n\r\neveryone after two years of kindergarten.  We cannot even  do\r\n\r\nthat  after  10  years  of general education.   In  fact,  as\r\n\r\neducation is about enabling each child to achieve, given  his\r\n\r\nown combination of talents and abilities, it must show up  in\r\n\r\nthe  end  the  diverse  achievements of people  in  different\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSE can, and should, bring children to an adequate\r\n\r\nlevel  of  school readiness.  It cannot, and  should  not  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to  \"equalise\" every child by Primary  1.   The  P1\r\n\r\nprogramme and P1 teachers recognise that pupils are different\r\n\r\nand they will adapt strategies that are appropriate for them.\r\n\r\nActually, our schools already have programmes that  cater  to\r\n\r\nthese   differences.   For  example,  the  Learning   Support\r\n\r\nProgramme is designed to help P1 and P2 children who have not\r\n\r\nyet  attained  a  sufficient level of English proficiency  to\r\n\r\nimprove  quickly.  This programme has proven to be successful\r\n\r\nand has greatly helped the children improve their reading and\r\n\r\nwriting skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap, school readiness is not about mastering some\r\n\r\nof the P1 curriculum by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday  one  in  primary school.  It is also  more  than  having\r\n\r\nadequate  language facility, important though it is.   School\r\n\r\nreadiness  is  about  being eager  to  learn,  able  to  make\r\n\r\nfriends,  take  turns  and share, pay attention,   and  enjoy\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have rightly identified teacher quality as the\r\n\r\nkey  to  raising  the quality of PSE.  This  point  has  been\r\n\r\nraised  by  Mr  Iswaran  and Mr Loh Meng  See.   My  Steering\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  PSE  has set up a  task force  comprising  MOE\r\n\r\nofficials  and  representatives from NIE  and  other  service\r\n\r\nproviders  in order to study the matter.  It will  look  into\r\n\r\nthe  teacher-training  curriculum  for  different  levels  of\r\n\r\nqualification, as well as an accreditation framework, and map\r\n\r\nout  progression  routes for PSE teachers  to  attain  higher\r\n\r\nqualifications.   The  task force will  also  study  how  PSE\r\n\r\nteachers  can participate in continual education and training\r\n\r\nin  order  to  develop better practice and  keep  abreast  of\r\n\r\nprofessional developments in their field.  At present,  there\r\n\r\nare a number of agencies providing PSE teacher-training.  The\r\n\r\ntask  force is looking into how MOE can assure standards  and\r\n\r\nrationalise  the  provision of teacher  training  among  such\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for research, I have earlier explained the need to\r\n\r\nestablish the long-term value of PSE.  I also made a case for\r\n\r\ncarefully  determining the optimal investment in PSE,  should\r\n\r\nit  be shown that it plays a significant part in raising  the\r\n\r\noverall  capacity of our people.  MOE intends to achieve  the\r\n\r\nabove  through  a  pilot  research  programme.   This  is   a\r\n\r\nlongitudinal  study to ascertain the long term cognitive  and\r\n\r\nnon-cognitive  benefits of PSE.  In particular,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nstudying  the impact of teacher-training and a new curriculum\r\n\r\non children's intellectual and social growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full details of the pilot research, such as the number\r\n\r\nof   children   involved,  participating  centres,   research\r\n\r\nmethodology and funding will be announced later.   The  pilot\r\n\r\nresearch  will  yield useful insights into  the  training  of\r\n\r\nteachers and the development of instructional materials.  The\r\n\r\naim  is  to  see  how  we can raise the  quality  of  PSE  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and what level of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  investment  is  justifiable.   A  full   research\r\n\r\nprogramme with longitudinal studies indicating the effects of\r\n\r\ndifferent pre-school strategies is likely to take many years,\r\n\r\nperhaps  up to seven.  MOE will carry out a pilot study,  and\r\n\r\nis  prepared to proceed on a wider scale on the basis of  the\r\n\r\npreliminary  results of this study after two to three  years,\r\n\r\nif  the preliminary results indicate that longer term results\r\n\r\nare likely to be good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I want to emphasise that MOE will not take\r\n\r\nover  PSE.   The provision of PSE will remain firmly  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the private and people sectors.  There is merit  in\r\n\r\nallowing  different centres with different  philosophies  and\r\n\r\nschools  of thought to offer different types of PSE.   If  we\r\n\r\nlook at the range of opinions offered by the press interviews\r\n\r\njust two days ago, some parents do not want the Government to\r\n\r\nstep  in  at  all.  They want choice. They want  variety.   I\r\n\r\nthink  leaving it in the private and voluntary  sectors  will\r\n\r\nencourage creative innovation, as each centre strives to meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of its unique pupil profile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge parents to work hand in hand with the\r\n\r\ncentres,  and  later  on with schools, to  provide  the  best\r\n\r\nlearning opportunities and experience for their children.  It\r\n\r\nmust be remembered that PSE is only one factor of success  in\r\n\r\nlearning.  Home support for children is equally, if not more,\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our eagerness to promote PSE, we must not think that\r\n\r\nearly  childhood education is just done in or by PSE centres.\r\n\r\nI  should  add  that  the  recent  spate  of  press  reports,\r\n\r\ninterviews and comments have shown that parents have  a  very\r\n\r\nwide  range of views on the issues.  This is to be  expected.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  these reports have raised a lot of expectations\r\n\r\nand  anxieties among parents regarding PSE, maybe this is  an\r\n\r\nunintended  result, it is still not very helpful.   It  would\r\n\r\nnot help matters.  MOE will take the approach of tackling the\r\n\r\nissues  step  by  step.  This will ensure  that  any  further\r\n\r\nGovernment investment in this sector will be worth the monies\r\n\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move on to compulsory education, I would like\r\n\r\nto respond to Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin's point regarding the\r\n\r\nsegregation  of  children  in  ethnically  run  or  religious\r\n\r\naffiliated  centres.   The  PCF  centres  which  provide  the\r\n\r\nlargest  proportion of pre-school education  to  children  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are open to everybody.  In fact, many of them  have\r\n\r\nMalay  teachers.  They offer classes in Malay language  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language.   Yes,  there  is  some  problem  with  the\r\n\r\noffering  of  Tamil  language and they are  trying  to  group\r\n\r\ntogether to send children to certain centres that have  these\r\n\r\nclasses.  Mr Zulkifli said that the Government should perhaps\r\n\r\ncome in and integrate the different ethnic groups in the  PSE\r\n\r\ncentres.   But if there are some parents who prefer  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to religiously-affiliated centres that  teach\r\n\r\nnot  just  PSE  but  religious education, I  think  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing very much the Government can do about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed most of the points raised by\r\n\r\nMembers  on  PSE.   Let  me move very quickly  to  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation as time is running out.  I would like to  thank  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen for calling us to focus on the twin goals  of\r\n\r\nour  national education system. To reiterate, the  two  goals\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to give our children a common core of knowledge\r\n\r\nand  skills,  which  will  provide a  strong  foundation  for\r\n\r\nfurther  education  and  training  that  would  prepare   our\r\n\r\nchildren for a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to give our children a common educational\r\n\r\nexperience which will help build national identity and social\r\n\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the range of views that we have been hearing at\r\n\r\nour  feedback  sessions, and from the press as well  as  from\r\n\r\nMembers of the House, I think it is important for us to  keep\r\n\r\nconstantly in mind these two main objectives of our  national\r\n\r\nschool  system.   In  deciding on whether or  not  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation should be introduced and the form and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduration  by  which it should take place, we must  constantly\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind  these  two major objectives,  which  are  the\r\n\r\nreasons why MOE has done its best to bring most children into\r\n\r\nour national school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Committee on Compulsory Education is still in the\r\n\r\nprocess of gathering feedback and studying the experience  of\r\n\r\nother countries, I do not think I should take up the time  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  much further.  We will study the issues  and  the\r\n\r\nfeedback raised by Members of the House very carefully before\r\n\r\nwe make our recommendations and put up a report by the second\r\n\r\nhalf of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is not here. I think he said something about\r\n\r\nthe  duration of compulsory education.  I would also consider\r\n\r\nhis views together with the other Members' when we decide  on\r\n\r\nthe duration of compulsory education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond very quickly to Dr Jennifer Lee's\r\n\r\nquestions on sexuality education.   She asked whether or  not\r\n\r\nwe  should  source  out the teaching of  sexuality  education\r\n\r\nbecause most teachers who are entrusted to teach this subject\r\n\r\nfind  it uncomfortable to do so.  This is indeed one problem,\r\n\r\nbut  sourcing out is not the solution because there are  very\r\n\r\nfew  agencies  out  there which have the  expertise  and  the\r\n\r\ninclination  to do so.  What we plan to do is that  we  would\r\n\r\nlike  to get the support not just from the teachers but  also\r\n\r\nfrom  members  of  the  community and,  where  necessary  and\r\n\r\npossible,  even  volunteer parents,  to  help  us  teach  the\r\n\r\nsubject.  Bearing in mind that not all teachers may have  the\r\n\r\nbackground  or  inclination to conduct lessons  in  sexuality\r\n\r\neducation,  we will be providing the schools with  a  set  of\r\n\r\ncriteria  for  the  selection  of  appropriate  teachers  for\r\n\r\nsexuality education. We will give them the adequate training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up the criteria, we have consulted\r\n\r\npsychologists, social workers and other professionals in this\r\n\r\nfield  from organisations such as the Institute of Health  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health, and Family Service  Centres.   They\r\n\r\nhave been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolved in the development of the selection criteria.   They\r\n\r\nwill  also be involved in the training of teachers,  and  may\r\n\r\nact as advisers to schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are presently developing a more holistic approach to\r\n\r\nsexuality  education, building on what is already covered  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing  curriculum and bearing in mind  the  different\r\n\r\nneeds   of   the  students  at  different  stages  of   their\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   A multi-media package is being produced  which\r\n\r\nwill examine concepts and attitudes in sexuality education in\r\n\r\na  structured  manner.  This will be used  as  an  additional\r\n\r\nresource   for   guided  discussions  about   responsibility,\r\n\r\nconsequences and choices with respect to one's sexuality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality education has been, and will continue to be,\r\n\r\ncarried out alongside civics and moral education because  MOE\r\n\r\nalways  believes in imparting the  right moral  values.   But\r\n\r\nMOE  is  aware  that  the subject of sexuality  touches  very\r\n\r\ndeeply  held  beliefs  which may differ  between  people  and\r\n\r\nacross  communities. As such, we will consult  various groups\r\n\r\nbefore  deciding  on  whether this  additional  component  of\r\n\r\nsexuality   education  should  be  built  into   the   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum  or  be  left as an optional  programme.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure Dr Jennifer Lee that we are working on the subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, technical education as provided\r\n\r\nby  ITE  is  not  considered high in the  aspiration  of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary school students, neither do parents encourage their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  take  this  up  as  a  career  choice,  thereby\r\n\r\nrelegating  it to a choice of last resort.  As  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  already  pointed  out earlier,  the  perception  of  ITE\r\n\r\neducation  is  that it is still a career choice resulting  in\r\n\r\ngetting one's fingers greasy.  This is unfortunate as  it  is\r\n\r\nnatural  in the human population that individuals are endowed\r\n\r\nwith   different  abilities  and  talents  across  the  whole\r\n\r\nspectrum.   Every  Singaporean  counts,  and  each  must   be\r\n\r\neducated  and trained to the best of his ability.  Thus,  ITE\r\n\r\ncaters  to those for whom the academic progammes of  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel  would  not  be suitable.  Furthermore,  ITE  graduands\r\n\r\nwould play meaningful roles in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety.   Hence,  the  negative  perception  regarding   ITE\r\n\r\ntraining should be changed and this job should not be left to\r\n\r\nthe Government alone.  All of us must play our part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the various Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  are  already  doing  their  part  by  inviting  the\r\n\r\nadvisers  to  hand out Edusave bursaries to ITE  students  at\r\n\r\npublic functions.  From time to time, we also read about  the\r\n\r\nsuccess stories of ITE graduands in striking out and starting\r\n\r\ntheir  businesses.  More could be done.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to do more in promoting the image of ITE  education\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, four out of every 10 students do\r\n\r\nnot  go  to the polytechnics or the universities.   They  are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to go to the Institute of Technical Education  to\r\n\r\nacquire  skills  that will fit them into  the  factories  and\r\n\r\noffices.   As  Singapore globalises and our  industries  move\r\n\r\ninto  high-tech, it is important that we train all our people\r\n\r\nat  every level to the best of their capability.  This is one\r\n\r\nof  the reasons for starting the Normal (Technical) stream to\r\n\r\ncater  to students who are not academically strong.  By  now,\r\n\r\nseveral Normal (Technical) stream cohorts have graduated.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the  Minister  would share  with  the  House  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the Normal (Technical) students to-date.   How\r\n\r\nmany  just  stopped  after  they  completed  their  secondary\r\n\r\neducation?  How many of them proceeded to the ITE?  How  many\r\n\r\nmanaged to transfer to a Normal (Academic) stream?  Among the\r\n\r\nlatter, how many went on to take the \"O\" level examinations?\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are fast transforming into a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   I  am  sure  that  the training  that  the  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) students are getting at the ITE is preparing them\r\n\r\nfor  such a future.  We should therefore get as many of  them\r\n\r\nas we can to go to ITE.  What more can we do to achieve this,\r\n\r\nso  that  more students can participate in the very  exciting\r\n\r\nand challenging future before us?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Dr Wang and Dr Tan for\r\n\r\ntheir interest in Technical Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their interest is well-placed because our technical\r\n\r\ninstitutions  have been tasked to provide technical  training\r\n\r\nfor  secondary  school leavers, so as to meet  the  economy's\r\n\r\ndemand  for  technicians and skilled manpower.   The  concern\r\n\r\nabout ITE's image is understandable, given that the number of\r\n\r\nstudents entering ITE constitutes a significant 25%  of  each\r\n\r\ncohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang believes that technical education deserves a\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  profile and reputation, an  image  that  people\r\n\r\nshould  have  in their mind.  I fully agree with  him  and  I\r\n\r\nwould substantiate this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of ITE in 1992, concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  have been made to improve the public perception  and\r\n\r\nimage of ITE.  There are many parties to thank for.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has invested, on average, $170 million a year\r\n\r\nover  the past five years in ITE to expand campuses and build\r\n\r\nmodern  facilities.  ITE students now study  in  a  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment and have access to the latest high-tech equipment\r\n\r\nand information technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the quality of teaching has improved. The\r\n\r\ncare  and  concern  shown by ITE teachers have  helped  boost\r\n\r\nstudents' self-esteem, confidence and motivation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the media has been most supportive of ITE. In\r\n\r\n1999  alone,  there  were 284 favourable  mentions  in  media\r\n\r\ncoverage in the form of press reports, TV exposures and radio\r\n\r\nbroadcasts.  This is a 21% increase over 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more ITE graduates make some headlines with\r\n\r\ntheir successes, ITE has found it useful to consolidate these\r\n\r\nsuccess  stories as an encouragement to staff,  students  and\r\n\r\nparents.  I have given to Members of the House here a copy of\r\n\r\nan  annual  publication  by ITE titled  \"I  did  it  my  way\"\r\n\r\n[indicating].   The  title is reminiscent of  the  well-known\r\n\r\nsong by Frank Sinatra, but it has a ring of confidence and a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain pride in it.  The current publication features 23 ITE\r\n\r\nalumni  who are now successful professionals or entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  also  those who have excelled in the pursuit of  further\r\n\r\nstudies  in  polytechnics  and  universities.   It  gives  an\r\n\r\naccount  of  how  ITE has given students  a  headstart  to  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile career by providing a technical education and  how\r\n\r\nteachers, through their enthusiasm in teaching and  faith  in\r\n\r\nthese  students,  have  inspired learning  sometimes  against\r\n\r\nseeming odds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, ITE is a reputed post-secondary educational\r\n\r\ninstitution  with  a network of 10 modern  and  well-equipped\r\n\r\ninstitutions,   offering  a  wide   range   of   engineering,\r\n\r\ntechnical,   business  studies  and  service  courses.    ITE\r\n\r\nstudents   are  proud  to  be  in  such  a  vibrant  learning\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premium placed by employers on ITE education did not\r\n\r\ncome  about just by better packaging and selling.  The latest\r\n\r\nemployment  survey  conducted by ITE  showed  that  the  mean\r\n\r\nmonthly  gross  salary of ITE graduates  had  increased  from\r\n\r\n$1,321  in  1997  to  $1,469 in 1998.  This  is  despite  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.  The employment survey also  reflected  a\r\n\r\nstrong  industry  demand for ITE graduates -  92%  of  1998's\r\n\r\ngraduates were employed and 87% of them obtained their  first\r\n\r\njobs within three months from graduation.  In short, there is\r\n\r\nreal substance in an ITE graduate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that ITE students are practice-oriented\r\n\r\nand  are  quick at assimilating hands-on training.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong in being practice-oriented, especially when you\r\n\r\nare good at it.  But there are also many who are academically\r\n\r\ninclined  -  they  may develop this trait a  bit  later  than\r\n\r\nothers.   About  15% of ITE students move on to  polytechnics\r\n\r\nand  2%  go  on to complete their university education.   The\r\n\r\nstatistics  also  suggest that ITE graduates  who  go  on  to\r\n\r\npolytechnics  are likely to do well there.   Generally,  they\r\n\r\nachieve  a higher pass rate than other non-ITE graduates  and\r\n\r\nin most instances, the pass rate was 100%.  Also, a higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npercentage  of them achieve Diplomas with Merit, as  compared\r\n\r\nto non-ITE graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan has asked whether ITE education prepares the\r\n\r\nyoung for a KBE.  I  would like to stress that ITE has always\r\n\r\nmade it a point to stay relevant to the needs and development\r\n\r\nof  the  economy  by regularly reviewing its  curriculum  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.    Employability  skills  such  as  communication\r\n\r\nskills,  mathematics,  IT,  industrial  studies  and   social\r\n\r\nstudies  are taught to ensure that students will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  demands beyond their own areas of specialisation.\r\n\r\nITE  has  also  introduced four courses during the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  in  response to the growth in IT and chemical  process\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must recognise that with the rapid pace of\r\n\r\ntechnological developments, knowledge and skills will  become\r\n\r\nobsolete  very  quickly.   The  only  way  to  ensure  skills\r\n\r\nrelevance  is  through  training  and  retraining.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  ITE  will gear up in terms of training capacity  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  so that more ITE graduates and the  workforce  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  can  upgrade  and  renew  their  skills  to   remain\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE's intake comprises mainly three levels of\r\n\r\nstudents   from   secondary  schools:   first,   the   Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical), Normal (Academic) as well as the `O' levels.  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  has  specifically  asked about the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nNormal (Technical) stream students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members recall, the Normal (Technical) course was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  1994  to  allow  the  more  practice-oriented\r\n\r\nstudents to go through 10 years of general education,  before\r\n\r\nundergoing technical training.  To ensure that these students\r\n\r\ncan  learn at a comfortable pace, they were given a different\r\n\r\ncurriculum which focused on the teaching of English  Language\r\n\r\nand  Mathematics  and  a  practical,  hands-on  approach   in\r\n\r\nlearning, so as to prepare them for a technical education  at\r\n\r\nITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made significant progress in achieving these\r\n\r\nobjectives.  Since the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the Normal (Technical)  stream  course,  an\r\n\r\nadditional 10% of the Primary 1 cohort has completed 10 years\r\n\r\nof  education.  The first three cohorts of Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nstream students have completed their secondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has provided them with the necessary foundation in\r\n\r\nlanguage  and mathematics for a technical education  in  ITE.\r\n\r\nThree  quarters  or  more of the Normal (Technical)  pool  of\r\n\r\nstudents are enrolled in ITE each year.  ITE will continue to\r\n\r\nencourage even more to enrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that our Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nstudents have done well in their ITE training.  Of the  4,033\r\n\r\nNormal (Technical) stream students who have enrolled for full-time  ITE training in January 1998, 2,204 have graduated with\r\n\r\nNTC-2  qualifications and 1,013 with Certificates  in  Office\r\n\r\nSkills,  marking  a success rate of 80%.  The  percentage  of\r\n\r\nNormal   (Technical)   students   who   have   been   awarded\r\n\r\nCertificates  of Merit is also comparable to those  from  the\r\n\r\nNormal (Academic) students who enrolled in ITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said enough about the benefits of ITE\r\n\r\neducation.   How can we spread this message even further?   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our  school  teachers can  help  to  encourage  more\r\n\r\nstudents  to  further  their  education  at  ITE  with  their\r\n\r\ncounselling on career development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE's next target would be the teachers who can help to\r\n\r\nmake  things  happen.   ITE  is  planning  to  introduce   an\r\n\r\nImmersion Programme to strengthen the information network and\r\n\r\nrapport between ITE and schools.  The programme will serve as\r\n\r\na platform for secondary school teachers to experience first-hand  the  improved teaching environment in ITE, to find  out\r\n\r\nabout  the different courses and modes of training available,\r\n\r\ntalk  to ITE students and obtain feedback on the progress  of\r\n\r\ntheir   ex-students   and   their  strengths   and   learning\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme will include in-house briefings, workshops\r\n\r\nand  sharing  sessions, as well as tours of  companies  which\r\n\r\noffer apprenticeship training to ITE\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents.  The apprenticeship training scheme allows students\r\n\r\nto  work to earn some income as they continue their education\r\n\r\nat  ITE.   The  tours will help teachers  to  gain  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the career prospects of ITE students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE has really come a long way. We are encouraged\r\n\r\nby  ITE's  achievements  and the positive  change  in  public\r\n\r\nperception.  We hope Members of this House and the public can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  support ITE in creating a fruitful  educational\r\n\r\nexperience for our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Ministry of Education would review the  school\r\n\r\nadmission  system.   Let  me give you  an   illustration.   A\r\n\r\nmother  looked at the plot of vacant land near her HDB  flat.\r\n\r\nWords  got  round that the Government was going  to  build  a\r\n\r\nprimary school there.  She was full of expectations.  \"Good,\"\r\n\r\nshe  said,  \"next time, my boy can just walk to  school.   No\r\n\r\nneed  to  take a bus.  Save time, save money.\"  Soon,  piling\r\n\r\nworks  started.  Noise, dust, and all sorts of inconvenience.\r\n\r\nNever  mind!   Suffer  a  bit  now,  but  think  of  all  the\r\n\r\nconveniences  next time.  It is worth it!  More  noise,  more\r\n\r\ndust,  and  the  children suffered plenty of  mosquito  bites\r\n\r\nbecause of the patches of water at the work-site.  Endure  it\r\n\r\nsilently.   Finally,  the  building was  completed,  and  the\r\n\r\nschool  began to enrol its first batch of students. Now,  the\r\n\r\nboy was all geared up to go to school next door.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When registration started, the boy was eligible under\r\n\r\nPhase   2(c).   Alas!  When  it  was  time  for  Phase   2(c)\r\n\r\nregistration,  the  school was fully enrolled.   Registration\r\n\r\nclosed.  No more place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, mother brings her son downstairs to take the school\r\n\r\nbus to a school which is one hour's ride away.

Perhaps we should bring these cases forward  to\r\n\r\nPhase 2(a) instead of Phase 2(c).\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nannual  Primary  One registration exercise is something  that\r\n\r\nparents  are  most concerned about.  As a parent,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with  sending  my  children to the  so-called  branded\r\n\r\nschool.   I can fully understand the eagerness of the parents\r\n\r\nto send their children to these branded schools, because they\r\n\r\nhave  high  expectations for their children.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of children seeking admission into these schools  has\r\n\r\nincreased over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Ministry that \"seeded\"\r\n\r\nprimary schools be given greater autonomy by allowing them to\r\n\r\nset  their  own  entrance test for the purpose  of  admitting\r\n\r\nPrimary  One  children.   Although the  prospective  students\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  subjected to a written entrance  test,  they\r\n\r\nshould  at  least  be  tested  on  their  conversational  and\r\n\r\ncounting  skills.   This is better than  the  present  system\r\n\r\nwhere  children are admitted in Phases 2(a), 2(b)  and  2(c).\r\n\r\nThe  majority of schools, such as neighbourhood  schools  and\r\n\r\nnon-SAP schools, can retain the existing admission procedures\r\n\r\nfor children who do not want to take such an entrance test.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, children enjoy priority in\r\n\r\nselection  when they register at a primary school within  two\r\n\r\nkilometres  of  their  home.   This  makes  sense   as   this\r\n\r\narrangement  reduces  the distance and  the  amount  of  time\r\n\r\nneeded for them to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommute  between home and school. Therefore,  ideally,  every\r\n\r\nhome  should lie within the two-kilometre radius of a primary\r\n\r\nschool.   But  this  is not always the case.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nexceptional houses are in Nee Soon South, the ward that I  am\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a request to make to the Minister. Would he\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  children from  such  houses  anywhere  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to enjoy priority selection at the nearest  school\r\n\r\nto their homes as it is for such children, the nearest school\r\n\r\nis  already far from home?  If these children do not study in\r\n\r\nthe nearest school, they will have to travel to a school even\r\n\r\nfurther  away. Hence, compared to a child that  lives  within\r\n\r\ntwo  kilometres  of  a  primary school,  these  children  are\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged twice over.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> As time is running out, I thought I\r\n\r\nshould  come  in  now and at least respond  to  some  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions that Members have raised in case I do not have time\r\n\r\nto answer afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P1 registration system balances many different\r\n\r\nconsiderations, including previous loyalty and  contributions\r\n\r\nto  the school as well as proximity to the school.  Proximity\r\n\r\nto  the  school  is actually one of the considerations  which\r\n\r\nreceives  quite a lot of weight because there is a  limit  to\r\n\r\nprevious  connections with the school after the old  boys  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  siblings have been taken into account. Whatever  is\r\n\r\nleft  is divided into two, half of that goes to students  who\r\n\r\nhave  previous connections with the school and the other half\r\n\r\nto  those who are living within the proximity of the  school.\r\n\r\nThere  are many ways to divide proximity and we have  decided\r\n\r\nto  treat those within two kilometres as one group and  those\r\n\r\nwithin  one  kilometre  as another group.  It  will  be  very\r\n\r\ncomplicated to go down any further than that. We  can  assure\r\n\r\nMr  Yeo that all students will be able to get a place in  the\r\n\r\nschool within their DGP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider what Dr Tan has raised, which is,\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  if  students do not have a school  within  two\r\n\r\nkilometres. We will see whether we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevise  a  system  for that.  As for having  schools  to  set\r\n\r\nentrance examinations, written or otherwise, I am really  not\r\n\r\nin   favour  of  that.  We  already  have  quite  a  lot   of\r\n\r\nexaminations and pressure for students in school. But I  must\r\n\r\nagree  with  Mr Peh though that whatever primary school  that\r\n\r\nour students go to, the quality is generally quite good.   As\r\n\r\nwe can see, students who come from very neighbourhood schools\r\n\r\ncan  do very, very well.  And when we have students who  have\r\n\r\ncome  from  neighbourhood primary  schools,  at  the  end  of\r\n\r\nPrimary 3, they do have an opportunity to take the evaluation\r\n\r\nfor the Gifted Education Programme and some of them do go for\r\n\r\nthe  Gifted Education Programme and they transfer schools  in\r\n\r\nthe  process. We have also seen that students who have stayed\r\n\r\non  in  their own primary schools have done very  well.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  one of the top students in the PSLE last year  came\r\n\r\nfrom  one of our neighbourhood primary schools, and I imagine\r\n\r\nthat  in  future,  we  will continue  to  see  some  of  this\r\n\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there is no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  responsibility for guiding and establishing  right\r\n\r\nvalues  in  children  lies with parents. This  responsibility\r\n\r\ncannot  be  delegated  to others, such  as  school  teachers,\r\n\r\nsocial workers, etc.  Yet, if there are children who are  not\r\n\r\nreceiving  the right nurturing, or perhaps none at all,  what\r\n\r\nshould  be  done?   Should the void be  left  alone  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of such children be left to chance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dual-income families, single parents, or\r\n\r\ncircumstances  where parents are unable,  unwilling  or  just\r\n\r\nunknowing  about how to go about bringing up their  children,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a need for support from the community or even  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  Every child has the potential to become a successful\r\n\r\nindividual  with the proper guidance and help.  I  am  urging\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education to consider setting  up  boarding\r\n\r\nschools  to  supplement those which exist in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ntrack record for properly operated boarding schools has  been\r\n\r\ngood  in Singapore and elsewhere. There is a long history  of\r\n\r\nsuch successes in other countries, especially in England.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, the fear that parents would be\r\n\r\nencouraged to take the easy path and send their children  off\r\n\r\nto  boarding schools, instead of making the effort  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem  up  themselves. This is a valid fear and no  doubt,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  motivating reason for some parents.   However,\r\n\r\nwhatever, the underlying reason for the children to  be  sent\r\n\r\nto  a boarding school, at least these children can be assured\r\n\r\nof  guidance  and assistance. At least as a  nation,  we  are\r\n\r\nassured  that our precious children are being cared  for  and\r\n\r\nnot neglected.  For every Singaporean to matter, our children\r\n\r\nmust  be given a fair chance at life. We must make sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  a fighting chance of becoming successful  adults.\r\n\r\nTheir success will be the nation's success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boarding schools provide the vital environment to help\r\n\r\nchildren through the difficult stage of teenhood. Proper care\r\n\r\nis  always  at  hand. In the boarding school, their  time  is\r\n\r\norganised  and they only have to concentrate on learning  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping.  Boarding  schools can  be  the  alternative  for\r\n\r\nparents who cannot cope with their parental role.  I urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry to consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, while Mr Ee has quoted one\r\n\r\nparticular tenet of S21, there is also another tenet of  S21,\r\n\r\nwhich  I consider equally important, and that is, the  family\r\n\r\nas  the  basic unit of society. I would not want to undermine\r\n\r\nthat   by  creating  boarding  schools  so  that  dual-income\r\n\r\nfamilies can discharge their responsibility to their children\r\n\r\nby  placing  them  in boarding schools.  In other  countries,\r\n\r\nthere   are  quite  different  circumstances.   For  example,\r\n\r\nboarding   schools   in  England  were   the   places   where\r\n\r\ncolonialists who came out to the Far East and elsewhere, sent\r\n\r\ntheir children back home to get an education. That is quite a\r\n\r\ndifferent  environment.  In fact, one of  our  objectives  of\r\n\r\nhaving  boarding  schools in Singapore is really  to  provide\r\n\r\nplaces for Singaporeans who go overseas and work overseas and\r\n\r\nwho  may  want to have their children come back to  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor secondary education, and we provide for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country.

In fact,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said many times in this House, teaching is a completely\r\n\r\nhuman  enterprise and the purpose of introducing  information\r\n\r\ntechnology  in  the  schools is  to  give  the  teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents  quite another tool in which to pursue teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning.

If the Member will remember, in the early 1990s,\r\n\r\nas  part  of  the  MOE's  review of its  role  in  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation (PSE), it was decided that provision of PSE  should\r\n\r\nremain  in  the hands of the private and people  sectors.  So\r\n\r\nthis  capital grant scheme was implemented.  In fact, Mr  Low\r\n\r\nhimself  asked  a  question of Mr Lee  Yock  Suan,  the  then\r\n\r\nMinister for Education, in a Parliamentary debate sometime in\r\n\r\n1992.  He was aware of the implementation of this project  in\r\n\r\n1992.\r\n\r\nThe  disbursements under the scheme are given under a set  of\r\n\r\ncriteria. Applicants must be registered with MOE.  Applicants\r\n\r\nmust   offer   a   good   two-year  kindergarten   programme.\r\n\r\nApplicants  must have a good track record and  must  be  non-profit  bodies.  They  must submit the  detailed  development\r\n\r\nproposal which has been approved by the relevant authorities.\r\n\r\nTo  safeguard  public  funds,  kindergartens  in  receipt  of\r\n\r\ncapital  grants  should  abide by the  following  conditions,\r\n\r\nfailing  which,  they  should refund  Government  the  entire\r\n\r\ncapital  grant. The applicants must apply the money  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose for which it is given and they should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplete the project within a stipulated period of time, keep\r\n\r\nproper  accounts and support claims for grants  with  audited\r\n\r\nstatements of accounts and so on.  The applicants  must  also\r\n\r\noperate  the  kindergartens for a period  of  at  least  five\r\n\r\nyears.   They  should  adopt  the  education  programme   and\r\n\r\ncurriculum  materials which meet the Ministry's standard  and\r\n\r\nthey  should  admit all members of the public, regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace,  language  or  religion.  It is never  meant  to  admit\r\n\r\npeople  with  political affiliations.  In the  event  that  a\r\n\r\nkindergarten  fails to operate within the minimum  stipulated\r\n\r\nperiod  of  five  years,  they will have  to  refund  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  capital grant on a pro-rated  basis  on  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  the  five-year period.  Any  kindergarten  which\r\n\r\nfulfills the above criteria is free to apply for the  capital\r\n\r\ngrant.   To answer Mr Low, this capital grant scheme  is  not\r\n\r\nconfined to the PCF.  Any charitable organisation which meets\r\n\r\nthese criteria is free to apply for the capital grant.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards how much money has been spent so far under\r\n\r\nthis  scheme,  to-date,  a total of $19.4  million  has  been\r\n\r\nreleased  to  the PCF, and 116 centres  have benefitted  from\r\n\r\nthis capital grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether this scheme has been effective\r\n\r\nin  helping to raise the quality of pre-school education.   I\r\n\r\nthink  so.   If  Members  remember, before  this  scheme  was\r\n\r\ninstituted,  the quality of the programmes being  offered  in\r\n\r\nthe  non-public sector, including the PCF centres, left  much\r\n\r\nto  be  desired.  Ten years back  - and we are talking  about\r\n\r\n1991    -    the  cohort  participation  rate  in  pre-school\r\n\r\nprogrammes  was  not high, not as high as  today,  especially\r\n\r\namong the lower income families.  Even among the children who\r\n\r\nattended pre-school programmes, a significant proportion were\r\n\r\nattending programmes for only two hours a day or for only one\r\n\r\nyear.   PCF  already  was  the major provider  of  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation at that time, and they were willing to come forward\r\n\r\nto put in resources and efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital grant scheme allows MOE to fund only up to\r\n\r\n90% of the capital or renovation cost.  The centre itself has\r\n\r\nto  come  out with the balance of 10%.  The PCF was the  only\r\n\r\norganisation  that met the criteria and was willing  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  to  put in resources and efforts to help  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  pre-school education in Singapore.   Ten  years\r\n\r\nlater,  ie,   now,  PCF  centres,  particularly  those  which\r\n\r\nbenefitted  from the capital grant scheme, have benefitted  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal.  And enrolment at these centres is often  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  brim.  The scheme has worked to help upgrade the quality\r\n\r\nand accessibility of PSE, especially to lower income families\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked whether this grant has been given to\r\n\r\nPSE  centres across all wards, and not just PAP wards.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the only organisation which met the criteria to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  this grant and willing to come forward has been the PCF.\r\n\r\nBut I must also inform him that not all PCF centres are using\r\n\r\nthis  grant.

The proposed Agri-food and Veterinary Authority  Bill\r\n\r\n2000  is  to  provide  the  legislative  framework  for   the\r\n\r\nformation of the new statutory board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now explain the rationale for the new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board.  The PPD was formed in 1959 to develop  and\r\n\r\nregulate   the   local   farming   industry.    Through   its\r\n\r\nagricultural development and health programmes,  PPD  ensured\r\n\r\nthat   local  farms  produced  safe  and  quality  food   for\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual shrinking of the agricultural sector\r\n\r\nover   the   years,  PPD's  role  and  focus  also   shifted.\r\n\r\nCurrently, PPD ensures the safety of primary food\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimports,   which  include  meat,  fish,  eggs,   fruits   and\r\n\r\nvegetables.  It also prevents and controls animal, bird, fish\r\n\r\nand  plant  diseases,  promotes animal welfare,  as  well  as\r\n\r\ndevelops  the agricultural industry and facilitates trade  in\r\n\r\nagriculture produce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in October last year, in my Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address,  I informed this  House  that  we  will\r\n\r\ndiversify  our sources for the supply of safe foods  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of our growing population.  We will also  upgrade\r\n\r\nour  food  inspection and surveillance systems and laboratory\r\n\r\nservices to further improve on food safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, local farm production supplies only 1.5% of the\r\n\r\npoultry,  10%  of the fish, 30% of the eggs  and  6%  of  the\r\n\r\nvegetables  consumed in Singapore.  The bulk of  our  primary\r\n\r\nfood  requirements comes from overseas sources.   This  heavy\r\n\r\ndependence  on  primary  food  imports  has  made   Singapore\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  disruptions in primary food supplies  due  to\r\n\r\nunforeseen  circumstances  at  the  sources  of  supply.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore need to continually identify new sources of  supply\r\n\r\nso that we can maximise food security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our heavy reliance on food imports also makes us\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  outbreaks  of  food-poisoning  and   zoonotic\r\n\r\ndiseases,   in   other  words,  where  animal  diseases   are\r\n\r\ntransmitted  to  humans.  In recent years,  there  have  been\r\n\r\ndisease outbreaks, such as the Mad Cow Disease, Avian Flu and\r\n\r\nthe  Nipah virus. It is vital for us to maintain a high level\r\n\r\nof integrity in our food safety system to detect, prevent and\r\n\r\ncontrol emerging diseases and food hazards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is now timely to restructure PPD into a\r\n\r\nstatutory board. The board will have a mandate to ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  Singapore's primary food needs. It will  also  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for animal and plant health, animal welfare  and\r\n\r\nthe   agricultural  industry,  all  of  which  are   integral\r\n\r\ncomponents of a food safety system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, AVA can leverage on its expertise\r\n\r\nin agriculture and veterinary science to offer consultancy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  to the food and agriculture industries in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the region. This may enable more overseas farms to  meet\r\n\r\nour  food safety requirements and enable them to export their\r\n\r\nfood  to Singapore. AVA can also provide consultancy services\r\n\r\nto  assist  our  local farmers to set up farms,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfacilitate the setting up of overseas food producing projects\r\n\r\nfor supply to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA finally can look into making Singapore an\r\n\r\nagricultural hub and distribution centre in the region.  This\r\n\r\nwill  increase the trading of agricultural and food  products\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore,  and enable us to  have  access  to  more\r\n\r\nvarieties of food.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA will plug into the relevant international networks\r\n\r\nto  monitor  closely  the  global spread  and  incidences  of\r\n\r\npotentially  dangerous diseases. It will also maintain  world\r\n\r\nclass diagnostic and testing laboratories. Resources are  now\r\n\r\nbeing put in place. Two new laboratories are being set up and\r\n\r\nthese  will  be  ready  by 2002. They will  have  the  latest\r\n\r\nequipment  and instrumentation for the detection  of  disease\r\n\r\nagents  and  harmful food contaminants as well as genetically\r\n\r\nmodified foods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill gives the short title and\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  Bill.  Part  II  provides  for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment,   incorporation  and   constitution   of   the\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III spells out the functions and powers of the\r\n\r\nAuthority.   These are essentially the same as those  already\r\n\r\nvested  in  PPD,  either  administratively,  or  through  the\r\n\r\nvarious  existing Acts administered by PPD. It will  also  be\r\n\r\nable to form companies, joint ventures or partnerships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts IV and V of the Bill relate to staff and financial\r\n\r\nmatters.  In  particular, clause 16  includes  provisions  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the Authority from liability in respect of  products\r\n\r\nor  processes which have been deemed to have conformed to the\r\n\r\nAuthority's requirements. This is required\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the  AVA  will be involved in formulating  standards  and\r\n\r\nissuing  certificates, brands or other marks related  to  the\r\n\r\nagri-food and veterinary sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI comprises the transitional provisions relating\r\n\r\nto  the  transfer of property, assets and liabilities of  the\r\n\r\nPPD to the AVA.  Under clause 31, all persons employed by PPD\r\n\r\nshall  be  transferred  to AVA. The terms  will  be  no  less\r\n\r\nfavourable  than  those enjoyed by the  officers  immediately\r\n\r\nprior  to  their transfer. The pension rights  of  Government\r\n\r\nemployees  would  also be preserved under clause  32  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII of the Bill covers the miscellaneous provisions\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Authority's symbol, powers of enforcement  and\r\n\r\npower  to  make regulations under the Bill. These  provisions\r\n\r\nwill help the Authority to carry out its functions. This Part\r\n\r\nalso includes the list of consequential amendments to be made\r\n\r\nto  other legislation which are currently administered by the\r\n\r\nPPD  and  to  any other legislation referring to PPD  or  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Primary Production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that we are now facing\r\n\r\nnew  challenges  in ensuring the safety of our  primary  food\r\n\r\nneeds and in dealing with threats from emerging diseases  and\r\n\r\nharmful food contaminants.  The restructuring of PPD into AVA\r\n\r\nwill  allow  us  to have a statutory board  to  work  towards\r\n\r\nmanaging these challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  Agri-food and Veterinary Authority Bill which  basically\r\n\r\nestablishes  a  statutory  board  for  the  current   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department.  As we all know,  a  statutory  board\r\n\r\ngives  greater  autonomy  to  the  Authority,  both  in   the\r\n\r\nemployment  and  deployment of staff and  greater  speed  and\r\n\r\neffectiveness  in  carrying out its  functions.   Even  as  a\r\n\r\ndepartment today of the MND, it is already doing a good  job,\r\n\r\nas can be seen in the way it has dealt with several\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrises  recently,  for example, in the Mad Cow  Disease,  the\r\n\r\nchicken flu and the pig diseases of Malaysia.  If anything, I\r\n\r\nthink  the PPD has always been very fast and too conservative\r\n\r\nin  the way they have dealt with food crisis.   In this case,\r\n\r\nI am not complaining and I think we should continue to remain\r\n\r\nconservative whether the PPD remains a Government  department\r\n\r\nor  statutory board.  The PPD has always been seen more as  a\r\n\r\nregulator  than  as a promoter of domestic  food  production.\r\n\r\nGiven  our limited land resources, it is understandable  that\r\n\r\nmost  of our food products would be imported.  However,  with\r\n\r\nnew  technology, new food production may take up a  lot  less\r\n\r\nspace  or  land.  With the PPD becoming a statutory board,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to urge the new Authority to be more proactive and\r\n\r\ntake  more initiatives to make Singapore more self-sufficient\r\n\r\nin our food supplies, in addition to its role as a regulator.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few specifics of the Bill.\r\n\r\nIn  clause 31 regarding the transfer of employees, it  states\r\n\r\nhere  that \"all persons employed immediately before that  day\r\n\r\n.  shall  be  transferred to the service of the Authority  on\r\n\r\nterms   no  less  favourable  than  those  enjoyed  by   them\r\n\r\nimmediately prior to their transfer.\"  The Bill does not seem\r\n\r\nto  address  any  of  its  structuring,  rationalisation  and\r\n\r\npossible redundancies that may occur in the process.  I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  ask  the  Minister  whether  there  will  be  such\r\n\r\nredundancies and, if so, how will these be addressed  by  the\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 regarding powers of enforcement states that\r\n\r\nany  person  found guilty of an offence shall  be  liable  on\r\n\r\nconviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a term not exceeding six months or to both.  My question\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  is: have these powers of enforcement  been\r\n\r\nincreased  as a result of the establishment of the  Authority\r\n\r\nor have they remained the same?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 46 there is a reference made to the Director\r\n\r\nof  Primary Production Department and it says that it  should\r\n\r\nbe  read  as  Director-General of  Agri-food  and  Veterinary\r\n\r\nServices.  Actually, I am a bit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfused  whether  this  job is the same  job  as  the  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  of  the  Authority or will  this  be  a  different\r\n\r\nperson.   I am not very clear about this. This is not  stated\r\n\r\nvery clearly in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  (PPD)  will  be  converted   into   a\r\n\r\nstatutory board on 1st April 2000.  The main concern  of  the\r\n\r\naffected officers is the terms of transfer of employment.  As\r\n\r\nmany  as  333 non-pensionable officers crossing over  to  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  will lose their option to convert  back  to\r\n\r\npension  upon  retirement under section 6(d) of the  Pensions\r\n\r\nAct.   They  are  mainly worried about their post  retirement\r\n\r\nmedical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, the Amalgamated Union of Public\r\n\r\nEmployees (AUPE) had several discussions with officials  from\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of National Development and PPD over the details\r\n\r\nof the conversion exercise and hoped to resolve this issue of\r\n\r\nperceived inequity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6(d) of the Pensions Act allows any non-pensionable officer in service before 7th December 1984 to\r\n\r\nreturn  his  excess CPF contributions at  the  point  of  his\r\n\r\nretirement from the civil service and claim pension  benefits\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Government.   However,  in  December  1984,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment acted to contain its liabilities by restricting it\r\n\r\nto  serving officers only.  Thus, officers affected  in  this\r\n\r\nexercise  have no choice but to cross over and, in so  doing,\r\n\r\nlose  the option.  The option has become more attractive with\r\n\r\nthe rising medical costs.  Pensionable officers crossing over\r\n\r\nto  a statutory board get to retain their pension benefits in\r\n\r\nfull.  This is the perceived inequity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are glad that the new statutory board intends to make\r\n\r\nit  attractive to the employees concerned to join the  board.\r\n\r\nWe welcome PPD's initiative to offer an attractive package to\r\n\r\nsolve this problem for those who convert.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nthis  offer  is now pending approval from PSD or MOF,  and  I\r\n\r\nurge the two departments to be supportive as it will be a win-win   solution  for  all.   With  this  offer,  the  affected\r\n\r\nemployees can decide what they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  do  with  the money.  One way is for  them  to  buy\r\n\r\nmedical insurance to cover for their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government is likely to conduct more such\r\n\r\nconversion exercises in future, each conversion exercise will\r\n\r\naffect  an increasing number of older workers who,  in  turn,\r\n\r\nwould  feel  a greater need for medical benefits.   And  each\r\n\r\ntime   a   conversion   exercise  takes  place,   unhappiness\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the loss of option would arise.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  so  for the exercises involving TAS, NParks,  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower, SBA and LTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gesture on the part of the PPD to offer an\r\n\r\nattractive package is appreciated.  It can serve  as  a  good\r\n\r\nreference  for  future conversion exercises.  It  also  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry concerned needs to be careful  to  ensure\r\n\r\nequitable treatment between different groups covered  by  the\r\n\r\nsame  exercise.   In  this case, it is a  comparison  between\r\n\r\npensionable and non-pensionable officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the profile of our workforce is changing, aging, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  will  increase the desire for  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nover time.  Hence, rules that impinge on such privileges will\r\n\r\nincreasingly become a cause for anxiety among the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Public Service Department\r\n\r\nto  be more pragmatic and creative in interpreting rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations   with  its  sophisticated  software,   expensive\r\n\r\nhardware  and the much needed \"heartware\" under the Singapore\r\n\r\n21  vision.  Policies and rules cannot always be mechanically\r\n\r\napplied, following precedent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to\r\n\r\nsupport  the Bill.  In doing so, I acknowledge the importance\r\n\r\nof the work performed by the PPD in its past incarnation, and\r\n\r\nlook  forward  to this new statutory body.   The  supply  and\r\n\r\nsafety  of  food in Singapore is, of course, very  important.\r\n\r\nIf Singaporeans enjoy their food, as we all know they do, the\r\n\r\nfact  that  they  can  enjoy with  safety  and  health  is  a\r\n\r\ntestimony  to  the  PPD's hard work.   This  is  particularly\r\n\r\nbecause of the surrounding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  When we take food from other places,  whether\r\n\r\nit  is the Nipah virus or whether it is the Mad Cow diseases,\r\n\r\nthere  are  increasing  strains  on  the  global  system   of\r\n\r\nsupplying safe and healthy food.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new agency, therefore, is very welcomed in being\r\n\r\nable to be more autonomous and, hopefully, more efficient and\r\n\r\neffective in its functions.  However, when I look through the\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  clause 11 and the powers of the  Authority  in\r\n\r\nclause  12  of the Bill, my first thought is that  we  should\r\n\r\ntake  this  occasion to make this new agency no longer  under\r\n\r\nthe  MND  but,  with  due respect, under his  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for the Environment.  Because when I look  at  this\r\n\r\nBill,  I  understand  that the powers of  the  Agri-food  and\r\n\r\nVeterinary  Authority  will  increasingly   be  about  public\r\n\r\nhealth  and safety.  This ties in very much with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment's  own  concern  of  hawkers  and  other\r\n\r\nsuppliers  of food to the consumer.  The present  arrangement\r\n\r\nof  having  it under MND has been, according to my  research,\r\n\r\nmore   a  historical accident of where the Ministers were  in\r\n\r\nthe former Cabinet than a matter of administrative logic.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  public health expertise and  focus  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment will actually  make  a  better\r\n\r\ncontext for this new entity.  I also believe the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Environment will be better plugged into the international\r\n\r\ncommunity   and  steps  in  the  direction  of  international\r\n\r\nstandards of environment and health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my next point. And this is that the\r\n\r\ninternational  community is moving quite rapidly  in  certain\r\n\r\nareas.   One of them is the question of genetically  modified\r\n\r\norganisms  (GMOs)  or  GM foods.  This has  been  brought  up\r\n\r\nseveral times in the debate in the Committee of Supply, and I\r\n\r\nwould  not  actually repeat the arguments  already  made.   A\r\n\r\nnumber  of  PAP  Backbenchers have called for  labelling.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Government's response can be summed up as  being,\r\n\r\n\"we  should  not panic the public and we will however  follow\r\n\r\ninternational  standards.\"   And  I  applaud  this  approach.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Singapore, as a country that does not produce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  own  food,  should not create a stampede mentality  that\r\n\r\nsuspects that perhaps everything is tainted.  That is not our\r\n\r\nintention.   And certainly, it is good to reassure  ourselves\r\n\r\nthat  we will follow, as we have before, the highest possible\r\n\r\ninternational standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is uncertainty at present, and therefore there is\r\n\r\nno  need to actually move.  And there is also the possibility\r\n\r\nof protectionism.  Countries that develop GMOs, like the USA,\r\n\r\nhave  tended to be quite reluctant to see labelling or  other\r\n\r\nmeasures.   Countries  that do not produce  these  GMOs  take\r\n\r\nreverse  position.   The  dispute  between  the  US  and  the\r\n\r\nEuropean Union over the Bee-hormone case is typical of  this;\r\n\r\nthat   your  science  follows  your  political  and  economic\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I think Singapore must note that there are\r\n\r\nemerging  international standards that we  can  follow.   The\r\n\r\nBiosafety  Protocol of the Convention of Biological Diversity\r\n\r\nhas  been  passed in Cartagena after various  discussions  in\r\n\r\nMontreal  and  elsewhere.  And this sets up an  international\r\n\r\nframework with very important principles for us.  One of  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  was of advance informed agreement.   That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay, not that you ban the import but simply that you are told\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is that you may be importing.  The second principle\r\n\r\nis  something called the precautionary principle.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to go into all the details of this concept after so many\r\n\r\ndays  of  debate in this House, but basically this  puts  the\r\n\r\nonus  on safety.  It asks us to act prudently rather than  to\r\n\r\nwait  for the last bit of scientific evidence to be in place.\r\n\r\nThis is important because, as I have said, it would be in the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  certain  countries to  pooh-pooh  questions  of\r\n\r\nsafety  and security.  It is a bit like, again, the  mad  cow\r\n\r\ndisease.  In that case, the British scientists were the  last\r\n\r\nto  see  any  problem.  Similarly, in the  Nipah  virus,  the\r\n\r\nproblem was probably detected for some time or observable for\r\n\r\nsome time before authorities in that country finally acted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is important to note that international standards\r\n\r\nare  coming  to  place  which  suggest  a  certain  level  of\r\n\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis,  I  should  tell the Minister, is  congruent  with  our\r\n\r\nexisting trade rules.  We want to observe international trade\r\n\r\nregime.   It  is  therefore important to note  that  the  WTO\r\n\r\nagreement on sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards does allow\r\n\r\na  country  to  take   provisional  measures,  if  there  are\r\n\r\npossible  dangers  to  public  health.   So  I  respect   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  position that we should wait for scientists  to\r\n\r\nset  heart on this point, but I would urge prudence,  as  has\r\n\r\nbefitted  the PPD's past, and I hope the AVA's  future.   Due\r\n\r\nprecaution  and prudence in importing and exporting  food  is\r\n\r\nreally  primary to Singapore's health and safety record,  and\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that other parts of our industries are  developing\r\n\r\nlife  sciences  should  not obscure this  first  and  primary\r\n\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make is that I have noticed\r\n\r\nin the press and from the statement of Mr Lew Syn Pau, Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament for Tanglin-Kreta Ayer, before this, that  PPD\r\n\r\nmight  be  taking  initiatives to  increase  agro-technology.\r\n\r\nThis  is  with  the  aim of intensifying farming.   This  may\r\n\r\npossibly involve the high level use of chemicals.  The aim is\r\n\r\nto  supply  them  to our own local market.   If  we  want  to\r\n\r\ncompete in this local market, I would imagine that this would\r\n\r\nbe  at fairly low prices, that is, Singapore would try to use\r\n\r\ntechnology rather than land space, but to enable it  to  sell\r\n\r\nfairly low price goods that would compete with others in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  So we can  produce some of its own products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is right to secure our food sources. But I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure  it  is  right to take this  approach  of  high\r\n\r\ntechnology and, possibly, high chemicals.  After all, we  are\r\n\r\na  very  small  and  densely populated  country.   Our  water\r\n\r\nsources  are  very  important.  For this  reason,  we  should\r\n\r\nalways  be  very  careful in protecting our environment.   We\r\n\r\nshould  also try, on the other hand, to produce higher value-added goods, rather than to try and match Indonesia, Malaysia\r\n\r\nor Thailand for low price market value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, my suggestion is that the AVA should\r\n\r\nconsider  encouraging and promoting organic  food  production\r\n\r\nrather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  agro-technology.  Organic food production  involves  no\r\n\r\nchemicals and therefore no danger to the environment.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso,  by  and large, higher value-added.  Organic vegetables\r\n\r\nfetch  relatively high prices.  I think, in  this  sense,  it\r\n\r\nfits  more  into  our strategy of protecting the  environment\r\n\r\nwhile seeking economic gain.  Reliable certification is  also\r\n\r\nvery hard to ensure, and here Singapore's reputation of being\r\n\r\na hard-task master of certificates you can rely on, will come\r\n\r\ninto play.  This would allow a balance against this promotion\r\n\r\nof  GM  foods.  When there is uncertainty, as it is now,  the\r\n\r\nurge should be to diversify our approaches.  It is observable\r\n\r\nthat  America  while  it  is,  on  the  one  hand,  promoting\r\n\r\ngenetically  modified food, it is also setting standards  for\r\n\r\norganic food certification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I have to make is that in deciding\r\n\r\nwhat to do with some agricultural land, we should revisit the\r\n\r\nidea  of  encouraging some level of citizen farming.  Systems\r\n\r\nof  allotment in other cities and countries are quite common.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think it may be important to help city dwellers relax\r\n\r\nand connect to the land, and this has a value, in addition to\r\n\r\ndollars for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is on animal control and welfare,\r\n\r\nwhich is part of the PPD's mission.  It is often said that  a\r\n\r\nmark  of a civilised life is not only how we treat our fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens  but how we treat our pets.  There have been  recent\r\n\r\nreports  of animal abandonment and abuse in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nhas been brought to court and cases have led to a very strong\r\n\r\nsignal that animal abuse in Singapore would not be tolerated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control of stray population of animals is, of course, an\r\n\r\nimportant  goal  that  PPD has been pursuing.   However,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  how  we try to achieve that  goal  and  how  we\r\n\r\nbalance this with allowing ownership and responsibility.   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  I understand that the PPD's existing  policies\r\n\r\nare  quite  unfavourable  to household  cats.   For  example,\r\n\r\ncompared  to dogs, cats cannot be licensed.  And if cats  are\r\n\r\ntagged with proper information about who they belong to,  who\r\n\r\nto contact,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  can  still  be rounded up and taken off and  eventually\r\n\r\ngassed, without reference back to the owner who is the person\r\n\r\nidentified on the tag.  I think that this might show a little\r\n\r\ntoo  much  efficiency in trying to keep the streets  free  of\r\n\r\nstray  animals.   While I agree with the  goal,  our  efforts\r\n\r\nshould   be  conducted  quite  humanely.   There  should   be\r\n\r\nreference  back  to the owners when cats are  taken  off  the\r\n\r\nstreet.   After all, while animals and pets may seem a  small\r\n\r\nthing  to  us,  for  many people they are a  source  of  very\r\n\r\ndomestic   pleasure  of  having  these   animals   in   their\r\n\r\nhouseholds.   This particularly, Sir, is when the  cats  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sterilised and tagged and I think they pose very little\r\n\r\nrisk   of   creating  a  large  and  disproportionate   stray\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we make a Government department to a statutory\r\n\r\nbody, we often wish to give it more greater flexibility.   In\r\n\r\nmany   cases,  profit  making  or  cost  recovery   is   also\r\n\r\nemphasised, with the promotion of commercial aspects.   There\r\n\r\nis nothing wrong with this.  But in the case of the AVA, they\r\n\r\nwill have to deal with safety and public health, what we eat,\r\n\r\nhow  we connect to the land, and how we relate to animals and\r\n\r\npets.   These  are aspects of humanity that I hope  would  be\r\n\r\nobserved and strengthened in the new entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to, first\r\n\r\nof all, thank all the Members who have spoken.  They have all\r\n\r\nsupported  the Bill.  They have also raised several questions\r\n\r\nwhich I would like to take this opportunity to answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Lew asked about the transferred\r\n\r\nemployees,  whether  there  will  be  any  restructuring   or\r\n\r\nredundancies.   The  idea  is for  us  to  transfer  all  the\r\n\r\nemployees  to  the  new statutory board because  all  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers involved are needed to allow the new statutory board\r\n\r\nto  exercise its functions and responsibilities.  So there is\r\n\r\nno  plan to do any restructuring or have any redundancies  at\r\n\r\nthis point in time, because, as I said, all the officers  are\r\n\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think it is correct for me to say that as the\r\n\r\nstatutory  board evolves, looks at its various functions  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, vis-a-vis other Government  departments,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there will be opportunities for the various Government\r\n\r\ndepartments to come together and to see how they can actually\r\n\r\nimprove  their coordination and their workflow.  So  if  that\r\n\r\nopportunity does arise in the future, the new statutory board\r\n\r\nshould take advantage of  that and improve its organisational\r\n\r\nstructure  in order to provide a better level of  service  to\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, I would also like to address Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay's point about where the new statutory board should\r\n\r\nreside,  whether  it  should be in the  National  Development\r\n\r\nMinistry  or  whether  it  should be  under  the  Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry.   I  think my colleague here has just  given  me  a\r\n\r\nsignal  that he does not think that it is a good  idea.   The\r\n\r\nfact of the matter really is that food safety and control  of\r\n\r\npublic  safety are inter-related issues.  I do not think  any\r\n\r\none  agency can do justice to the very broad range of  issues\r\n\r\nthat  need  to  be looked at and resolved.  So, for  example,\r\n\r\nwhen you are talking about food safety, we have the PPD which\r\n\r\nis  involved in the control of safety of foods and  assurance\r\n\r\nof  safety  of  primary foods.  We have the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment which looks at the safety of food at  the  retail\r\n\r\nend.  We also have Ministry of Health which also looks at the\r\n\r\nfood safety and communicable diseases and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these agencies have their own areas of expertise and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and together, whenever there is  any  danger,\r\n\r\nwhenever  there is any sign that we are going to be  affected\r\n\r\nby some major outbreak of disease, as what happened last year\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Nipah  virus outbreak took place, then  all  these\r\n\r\nagencies come together.  We form an Inter-Ministry Task Force\r\n\r\nand  we  fight the problem together.  I think this has worked\r\n\r\nwell in the past.  I do not see why it would not work in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  with the AVA.  And I would suggest that  we  look  at\r\n\r\nthis  particular modus operandi and improve upon  it,  rather\r\n\r\nthan to try and establish a neat solution\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhereby everything comes together under one agency, and  then\r\n\r\nwe try and decide where to put that agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this particular point in time, we would not make any\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the  different responsibilities of  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies  involved.  But down the road, I think it is  proper\r\n\r\nfor  us,  as  we work together, to decide how we  can  either\r\n\r\napportion  or  re-apportion responsibilities or  indeed  even\r\n\r\namalgamate some of them.  But I do not see the time where all\r\n\r\nthese  particular responsibilities will come  under  one.   I\r\n\r\nthink the range of expertise required is simply too great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked whether the powers of enforcement have\r\n\r\nbeen increased or remained the same.  Yes, the answer is that\r\n\r\nthey  have remained the same.  He asked whether the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Primary Production Department is the same person  as  the\r\n\r\nDirector-General of Agri-food and Veterinary Authority.   The\r\n\r\nanswer is yes, he is the same person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked about the transfer of officers\r\n\r\nto  the  new  statutory  board.  As I  have  said,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  transfer  of  these  officers  from   the\r\n\r\ndepartment, a Government department, to a statutory board  on\r\n\r\nterms no less favourable than what they are getting today.  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that  some  of  the  officers  today  who  are  non-pensionable will lose the option to convert if they  were  to\r\n\r\ntransfer over to the AVA.  My officers have been looking into\r\n\r\nhow  we  can provide a package which would allow the transfer\r\n\r\nto  take  place  without  adversely  affecting  the  officers\r\n\r\nconcerned.   I  understand the concerns of the  officers.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand the concerns of the union who represents them,  as\r\n\r\narticulated by the Member just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say that at this point in time, we are\r\n\r\nactively  exploring various options to try and tide over  the\r\n\r\nofficers  when  they  transfer  from  the  Department  to   a\r\n\r\nstatutory board.  Of course, we will certainly look into  his\r\n\r\nsuggestion of ex-gratia payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to Mr Simon Tay's point about GMO and the\r\n\r\nbiodiversity protocol.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  far  as GMOs are concerned, I think he is right in saying\r\n\r\nthat  we should not panic the public.  The media has given  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  attention  to GMOs in recent months.   Some  of  the\r\n\r\nreporting  has been quite sensational; some of the headlines,\r\n\r\nfor example, Frankenstein food, and so on, and given rise  to\r\n\r\na  lot  of anxiety.  But the fact of the matter is that there\r\n\r\nare  genetically modified foods currently on our  shelves  in\r\n\r\nthe  supermarkets. But these have been determined to be  safe\r\n\r\nfor  us  to eat. There is no reason for us to suddenly confer\r\n\r\nupon  such foods monster status.  We have been eating it  all\r\n\r\nthis  time. PPD monitors the food very closely, in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  trends  in the world. We take the necessary precautions.\r\n\r\nFood,  which is not approved in other countries, will not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  into Singapore. Foods which have been identified  as\r\n\r\nnot  safe, we will take immediate action to remove them  from\r\n\r\nthe shelves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very new field. There is a lot of discussion\r\n\r\ngoing  on now. What we have done in Singapore is to  try  and\r\n\r\nfollow the discussions that are going on in the international\r\n\r\narena.  We  have  formed in Singapore what is  known  as  the\r\n\r\nGenetic   Modification   Advisory  Committee   (GMAC)   which\r\n\r\nincludes,  PPD,  ENV, National Science and Technology  Board,\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  so  on.   We are  trying  to  establish  a\r\n\r\nprocedure  and  a protocol whereby we can also  label  foods,\r\n\r\ntrack them, monitor them and assess whether they are safe  or\r\n\r\nnot,  etc.  This is an on-going process. We will continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  how other countries tackle the issue. We will  abide\r\n\r\nby what is international practice in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the biosafety protocol, the Cartegena Protocol\r\n\r\nthat  the Member mentioned just now, I should inform him that\r\n\r\nthe lead agency for the bio-diversity protocol is NParks, not\r\n\r\nPPD, because it goes beyond GMOs. It also talks about the bio-diversity in various countries. Having said that, we are also\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  discussions  in the  Cartegena  process  very\r\n\r\nclosely.  He  is correct in saying that there  is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npolitics  involved  in the discussions. Countries  which  are\r\n\r\nproducers  of  one particular type of food obviously  have  a\r\n\r\ncertain point of view. Countries which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   net   consumers  have  a  different  point   of   view.\r\n\r\nUltimately,   at   the  end  of  the  day,  invariably,   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions go beyond just the science of it but go into  the\r\n\r\npolitical  arena.  We  are  not producers  of  the  food  but\r\n\r\nconsumers,  and we will have to take an appropriate  position\r\n\r\ncommensurate with our own interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as agri-technology is concerned, the point that\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay  made  that we should try  and  restrict  high\r\n\r\ntechnology  farming because it may involve the  use  of  high\r\n\r\nchemicals,  let  me  assure him that high technology  farming\r\n\r\ndoes  not necessarily equal high chemical farming.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  PPD  is extremely strict about the level of contaminants\r\n\r\nand the use of pesticides in our food. First of all, we do  a\r\n\r\nvery  stringent test on all the primary foods like vegetables\r\n\r\nand  so  on  that  are  prone  to high  pesticides  and  high\r\n\r\ncontaminants  and having tested them, we are  not  averse  to\r\n\r\ndestroying those which contain a very level of pesticides. We\r\n\r\ngo  in  further to the extent of banning imports  from  those\r\n\r\nparticular farms. All those actions demonstrate that we  take\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of pesticides and contaminants in our  food  very\r\n\r\nseriously.   It would be ironic for us to do  so  and  be  so\r\n\r\nspecific  and so tough on food being imported, and yet  allow\r\n\r\nhigh-tech farming in Singapore which makes use of these  high\r\n\r\npesticides.  It does not make sense and we certainly  do  not\r\n\r\nintend  to  take such an approach.  I would like to  reassure\r\n\r\nhim  on  that.   The  fact  is yes, where  we  can,  we  will\r\n\r\nencourage organic farming and some farms are already pursuing\r\n\r\nthis option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on citizen farming. I am not sure\r\n\r\nexactly what he means by citizen farming. If he means that we\r\n\r\nset  aside plots of land for people to go and farm, that  is,\r\n\r\nhobby farm, there are farms in Singapore located in the agri-technology parks which allow the city dwellers to go there to\r\n\r\nsee  what  a vegetable looks like when it is growing  in  the\r\n\r\nground and not in the supermarket.  There are also farms that\r\n\r\nallow  children to visit them, to look at the animals and  so\r\n\r\non.  If that is what he means, then that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  provided for.  But if he is talking about  setting\r\n\r\naside  land  around HDB estates for people to  go  there  and\r\n\r\nfarm,  that  is  pretty  difficult  for  us  in  land  scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is about cats and dogs. I must confess\r\n\r\nthat  I  am not familiar with the issue of whether  we  treat\r\n\r\ncats  more favourably than dogs.  If he would like to file  a\r\n\r\nquestion, I can give him a more intelligent answer.  At  this\r\n\r\nstage,  I must confess I do not know about that.  I  think  I\r\n\r\nhave answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, on the question regarding the\r\n\r\nDirector of Primary Production, I think I should make  myself\r\n\r\na  bit  clearer because under clause 46 of the Bill, it  says\r\n\r\nthat  any  reference  made  to  this  person  is  actually  a\r\n\r\nreference  to the Director-General, Agri-food and  Veterinary\r\n\r\nServices.  Under the new statutory board, there  is  actually\r\n\r\nthe  position  of  the Chief Executive.  But  today,  if  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Primary Production is the Chief Executive  of  a\r\n\r\ndepartment,  my  question is:  is he, under this  new  title,\r\n\r\nalso the Chief Executive of the new statutory board?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I may not have made myself clear. The\r\n\r\nDirector-General, Agri-food and Veterinary Services, who  has\r\n\r\nbeen appointed under the Animals and Birds Act, is the person\r\n\r\nwho  exercises the responsibilities of the previous Director-General of the Primary Production Department.  Yes, he is the\r\n\r\nsame  person.  But  we  have provided for  a  post  of  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer. So the Chief Executive Officer may be  the\r\n\r\nsame  person  as  the Director-General of the  Agri-food  and\r\n\r\nVeterinary Services as stated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsure  all  of us have been waiting for this moment.
