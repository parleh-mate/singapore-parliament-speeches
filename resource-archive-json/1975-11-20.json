This represents  approximately\r\n\r\n35%,  or 17 1/2% per year, of the teachers with  five\r\n\r\nyears  or  more  teaching  experience.  Though  no\r\n\r\nrecords  of  the correlation between  a  teacher's\r\n\r\nyears  of service and his attendance at in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  were kept before 1974, the present  trend\r\n\r\nindicates that there is a six-year cycle in  which\r\n\r\nevery teacher will be given an opportunity for in-service  training.  The  last  in-service   course\r\n\r\nattended  by 38 participants ended on 7th November\r\n\r\n1975. Currently, four courses involving about  480\r\n\r\nparticipants  are in progress.

Members  are  no  doubt  aware  that   the\r\n\r\nRegulation of Employment Act was enacted  in  1966\r\n\r\nto  regulate the employment of foreign workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic.  The objective was to  control  the\r\n\r\nflow  of  such workers into our country to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their  employment contributes to the  social\r\n\r\nand economic development of our society. Under the\r\n\r\nAct,   foreign  workers,  principally  those  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia whose monthly salaries are not more  than\r\n\r\n$750, are required to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napply  for  a work permit before they start  work.\r\n\r\nThe  Work  Permits  Office has discovered  certain\r\n\r\ninadequacies in the Act in nearly 10 years of  its\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend certain provisions of\r\n\r\nthe   Act   with   a  view  to  overcoming   these\r\n\r\nshortcomings.  The  Ministry has  discovered  that\r\n\r\nsome   work   permit  holders   are   working   in\r\n\r\noccupations  other than those specified  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective  work permits. The Work Permits  Office\r\n\r\nhas,   for  example,  found  work  permit  holders\r\n\r\nworking as clerks when the permit has been  issued\r\n\r\nto them to work as factory operators. Legally this\r\n\r\nis  not an offence as section 8 of the present Act\r\n\r\nprohibits   the  employment  of  an  employee   or\r\n\r\ncontract  worker only if he does not have  a  work\r\n\r\npermit.  This  inadequacy in the Act  reduces  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our control of foreign workers in\r\n\r\nthe Republic. Clause 2 of the Bill therefore seeks\r\n\r\nto  amend section 8 of the present Act to prohibit\r\n\r\nany employer from engaging any person who has been\r\n\r\nissued  with  a work permit in any capacity  other\r\n\r\nthan  in  accordance with the conditions contained\r\n\r\nin the work permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Regulation of Employment Act, as it now\r\n\r\nstands,  does not cover self-employed  occupations\r\n\r\nlike   insurance  agents,  canvassers,   salesmen,\r\n\r\ncommission  agents and others. The  employment  of\r\n\r\nforeigners  in  these occupations has  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic ramifications. The Ministry has found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  at  times to regulate  administratively\r\n\r\nforeigners   taking   up   certain   self-employed\r\n\r\noccupations. To enable the Ministry  to  have  the\r\n\r\npower  to bring such persons within the Regulation\r\n\r\nof  Employment Act, clause 3 of the Bill seeks  to\r\n\r\namend section 8 to empower the Minister from  time\r\n\r\nto  time  by Gazette notification to prohibit  any\r\n\r\nnon-citizen from engaging in any trade, occupation\r\n\r\nor  other activity carried on for the purposes  of\r\n\r\ngain unless he has obtained a work permit for that\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permits Office has also found that some\r\n\r\nemployers  and employees has connived  to  furnish\r\n\r\nfalse  information with a view to seeking approval\r\n\r\nfor  their  applications for work  permits.  False\r\n\r\ndetails, for example, have been provided on  types\r\n\r\nof  job  and experience and qualification  of  the\r\n\r\napplicants.  The giving of such false  information\r\n\r\nis  not  an  offence under the present  Act.  This\r\n\r\npractice must be discouraged to enable us to  have\r\n\r\nbetter  control  of  the  recruitment  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  for work in Singapore. Clause 5 therefore\r\n\r\nseeks to amend section 14 of the Act to make it an\r\n\r\noffence  for  any  person,  whether  employer   or\r\n\r\nemployee,  to  make  a  false  statement  in   the\r\n\r\napplication for a work permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has also taken the opportunity\r\n\r\nto   introduce  two  administrative  measures   to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  operation of  the  Act.  The  first,\r\n\r\ncontained in clause 4 of the Bill, seeks to  amend\r\n\r\nsection 11 of the Act to provide for the levy of a\r\n\r\nfee of $5 for the replacement of a lost, destroyed\r\n\r\nor defaced work permit. This will encourage proper\r\n\r\ncustody of work permit cards. The other, contained\r\n\r\nin  clause 6 of the Bill, seeks to introduce a new\r\n\r\nsection empowering the Commissioner for Employment\r\n\r\nto compound any offence committed under the Act by\r\n\r\naccepting from the person reasonably suspected  of\r\n\r\ncommitting  an  offence a sum not exceeding  $100.\r\n\r\nThe  intention  is to expedite the meting  out  of\r\n\r\npenalties to those who have infringed the  law  as\r\n\r\nwell   as  eliminate  the  time-consuming  process\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  preparing for prosecution  in  court\r\n\r\nespecially in cases of minor offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint of clarification from the Minister of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No employer or contractor shall employ an\r\n\r\nemployee or contract worker, as the case  may  he,\r\n\r\notherwise  than in accordance with the  conditions\r\n\r\ncontained in the work permit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what happens if an employer, who originally\r\n\r\nengages  a  worker as a factory hand, subsequently\r\n\r\npromotes  the employee to a higher grade,  say,  a\r\n\r\nclerical  post,  because  of  his  efficiency?

These recommendations  were\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Government in the  interest  of\r\n\r\nrational and orderly wage increases. Section 46 of\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act was then amended in July  1972\r\n\r\nincorporating these recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present section 46 of the Act, a trade\r\n\r\nunion  of  employees is entitled to negotiate  for\r\n\r\nthe   payment  of  either  both  an  annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement and an annual bonus or both  an  annual\r\n\r\nwage  supplement  and annual  wage  increases.  An\r\n\r\nemployer  is  given the right to  make  an  option\r\n\r\nbetween  negotiating for the payment  of  both  an\r\n\r\nannual  wage  supplement and a bonus  or  both  an\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement and annual wage  increase.\r\n\r\nHe will, however, be bound by his choice of option\r\n\r\nfor  the  duration  of  any  award  of  collective\r\n\r\nagreement  which  may  be  made  regarding   these\r\n\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer who cannot afford to pay any of the\r\n\r\naforesaid  combinations may offer to negotiate  to\r\n\r\npay  an  annual wage supplement or bonus or annual\r\n\r\nwage increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of annual wage supplement payable by\r\n\r\nthe  employer who has paid annual bonuses  to  his\r\n\r\nemployees prior to 1972 is to be the equivalent of\r\n\r\nthe  average of the bonuses paid in respect of the\r\n\r\nthree years preceding the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommencement of the Act, that is, 1972, or to  the\r\n\r\nlast  annual bonus paid, whichever is the greater,\r\n\r\nsubject  to a maximum amount equivalent  to  three\r\n\r\nmonths' wages of his employees, except that  where\r\n\r\nsuch  bonuses  were  based on exceptional  trading\r\n\r\nresults   or  increased  productivity  which   the\r\n\r\nemployer  finds have diminished to  a  significant\r\n\r\ndegree,  the  employer may negotiate for  a  lower\r\n\r\nquantum of the annual wage supplement to be  paid.\r\n\r\nIf  an  employer  has not paid any  bonus  to  his\r\n\r\nemployees  or  has paid a bonus of less  than  one\r\n\r\nmonth's wages before the commencement of this Act,\r\n\r\nthe  annual wage supplement payable by  him  shall\r\n\r\nnot exceed one month's wages of his employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, contrary to the provisions of section 46,\r\n\r\na number of employers have at the request  of\r\n\r\nunions attempted or in some cases even paid annual\r\n\r\nwage   supplements  in  excess   of   the   levels\r\n\r\nprescribed under section 46. In a number of  cases\r\n\r\nthe  additional annual wage supplements paid  took\r\n\r\nthe form of ang pows and ex gratia payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an undesirable situation which, if\r\n\r\nunchecked,  can  lead  us  back  to  the  pre-1972\r\n\r\nsituation  of disputes over bonuses and ex  gratia\r\n\r\npayments  and disorderly wage increases. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe Secretary-General of the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress,  in  a  speech  to  the  NTUC   Ordinary\r\n\r\nDelegates  Conference in December 1974 said  that,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To take the lid off on bonus payments once\r\n\r\nagain,  would only be to provide a recipe  for  an\r\n\r\nindustrial free-for-all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  went on to tell the Conference that \"this must\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed to happen, least of  all  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent climate of the economy\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is essential for us to\r\n\r\ndevelop a sound national wage system based on  the\r\n\r\none  recommended  to  us  by  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil   in  1972.  A  system  of  orderly   wage\r\n\r\nincreases  will  contribute  greatly  to  a  right\r\n\r\ninvestment  climate in our Republic.  Members  are\r\n\r\nall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  well aware of the need for us to make greater\r\n\r\nefforts to attract investment into Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nyears  ahead  are going to he different  from  the\r\n\r\nlast  five  years. We are unlikely to be  able  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  our years of double digit economic growth.\r\n\r\nWe  simply cannot afford undisciplined and chaotic\r\n\r\nwage  increase  demands to hamper our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nachieve   maximum  development  in  a  period   of\r\n\r\ncomparatively reduced growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  aimed at preventing the  situation  of\r\n\r\nthe  type  I have just described. There are  three\r\n\r\nimportant  aspects  of  clause  2  of  the   Bill.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  it  is now mandatory for  employers  and\r\n\r\ntrade unions of employees to observe the levels of\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement which have been frozen  on 1st July, 1972.\r\n\r\nSecondly, employers may choose  to\r\n\r\npay  either both an annual wage supplement and  an\r\n\r\nannual bonus or both an annual wage supplement and\r\n\r\nannual wage increase. It will be an offence if the\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement, annual bonus  and  annual\r\n\r\nwage increase are all paid or asked to be paid  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time. The employer alone  shall  decide\r\n\r\nwhich of the two combinations he shall opt for. It\r\n\r\nis  an offence for a trade union or anyone to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  payments in variance of the option which  the\r\n\r\nemployer has chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, employers may only, with the prior\r\n\r\nwritten  permission of the Minister  for  Finance,\r\n\r\npay  any  additional  annual  wage  supplement  in\r\n\r\nexcess of the frozen quantum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill in the House\r\n\r\non  19th August, 1975, 1 have received a number of\r\n\r\nrepresentations   from  organisations   like   the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce, the National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion   Congress  and  the  Singapore   Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation.   As  a  result  of  some   of   these\r\n\r\nrepresentations  I have decided  to  introduce  an\r\n\r\namendment to clause 2 of the Bill. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment  will  be  dealt  with  later   at   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage. At the moment I shall only  deal\r\n\r\nwith the other representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Trades Union Congress has requested\r\n\r\nthat  amendments be made to the Bill to allow  for\r\n\r\nthe continued payment of signatory bonuses and  ex\r\n\r\ngratia payments which are made upon the signing of\r\n\r\na  collective agreement. The NTUC has argued  that\r\n\r\nsuch payments are not really intended to evade the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Employment Act relating  to  the\r\n\r\npayment of the annual wage supplement or bonus. My\r\n\r\nMinistry is of the view that such onetime lump sum\r\n\r\npayments  are  not  an annual wage  supplement  or\r\n\r\nbonus  payments  and are, therefore,  outside  the\r\n\r\nambit of section 46 of the Act. I see no objection\r\n\r\nto  such payments being made if they are for  good\r\n\r\nreasons, such as compensation for change of annual\r\n\r\nincremental  date, or payment in  lieu  of  actual\r\n\r\namount  of arrears of wage adjustments, or payment\r\n\r\nin  lieu  of  arrears  of  overtime  arising  from\r\n\r\nbackdating  of  new salary scales.  However,  such\r\n\r\npayments  should not be made for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\ninducement for signing the collective agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now deal with clause 8\r\n\r\nof  the Bill. The Report of the Committee on Crime\r\n\r\nand  Delinquency reveals that juvenile  crime  and\r\n\r\ndelinquency  has increased in the Republic  during\r\n\r\nthe period 1968 to 1972. The Report also discloses\r\n\r\nthat the majority of youths who flout the law  are\r\n\r\nschool  leavers  and  that  the  tendency  towards\r\n\r\ncriminal  or  delinquent behaviour  is  negligible\r\n\r\nuntil  the age of 13 and strongest at the ages  of\r\n\r\n15-16,  17-19 and 20-21. The Committee is  of  the\r\n\r\nview that one of the solutions to this problem  is\r\n\r\nthe  adoption  of  measures to enable  our  school\r\n\r\nleavers  to be trained and be gainfully  employed.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not only benefit the youths  concerned\r\n\r\nbut  also  provide a source of supply  of  trained\r\n\r\nworkers for the economy. The Government has  since\r\n\r\ntaken note of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendation of the Committee, and the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  to  the Employment  Act  is  to  allow\r\n\r\nyouthful  school  leavers to  be  trained  and  be\r\n\r\ngainfully employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8, children who are 12 and below 14\r\n\r\nyears  old  will  in  future  be  allowed  to   be\r\n\r\ngainfully  employed in industrial undertakings  as\r\n\r\napprentices under any apprentice schemes  approved\r\n\r\nand  supervised by the Industrial Training  Board.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  existing provisions of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  young persons between the ages of 14 and  16\r\n\r\nare    required   to   obtain   certificates    of\r\n\r\nregistration  from  the  Commissioner  for  Labour\r\n\r\nbefore  they may be allowed to work in  industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to repeal Part IX of\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act dealing with such registration\r\n\r\nso as to facilitate the speedy employment of young\r\n\r\npersons in the 12-16 age group. While measures are\r\n\r\nproposed  to provide for the training and  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment  of  the  young,  it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to protect the health, safety and welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  young in the 12-16 age group who will  be\r\n\r\nworking in industrial undertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 empowers the Minister for Labour to make\r\n\r\nprovisions   to  that  effect  in  the   form   of\r\n\r\nregulations  to be gazetted after  this  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen  passed. It is therefore proposed  to  repeal\r\n\r\nall  sections relating to conditions of employment\r\n\r\nof  children  and young persons  in  the  Act  and\r\n\r\nincorporate them in the regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Trades Union Congress has written to\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  pointing  out  that   with   these\r\n\r\namendments the number of workers between the  ages\r\n\r\nof  12  and  18 will become greater and suggesting\r\n\r\nthat an amendment be made to the Trade Unions  Act\r\n\r\nto  allow such workers trade union membership  but\r\n\r\nwithout  the right to hold office or  to  vote  at\r\n\r\ngeneral  meetings  of  members.  My  Ministry   is\r\n\r\npresently looking into the question of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namending  the Trade Unions Act and will take  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part XVI of the Employment Act, the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  is  empowered to  conduct  inquiries\r\n\r\ninto  claims  lodged by employees  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nmatters relating to terms and conditions of  their\r\n\r\nemployment.  Such  inquiries are  informal.  Legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities  and forms are avoided  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  This  is  in order  to  achieve  speedy\r\n\r\nsettlement   in  the  interests  of  the   parties\r\n\r\nconcerned.  In  the experience  of  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nemployers  are  usually  represented  by   lawyers\r\n\r\nwhereas the employees are not. We have found  that\r\n\r\nthe   presence   of  lawyers  at  these   informal\r\n\r\ninquiries has tended to formalise the character of\r\n\r\nthe  proceedings leading to unnecessary procedural\r\n\r\ncomplications, thereby delaying the completion  of\r\n\r\nthe  hearings. In many cases it has also made  the\r\n\r\nparties involved less amenable to conciliation and\r\n\r\namicable   settlement  of  claims.  It   must   be\r\n\r\nemphasised  that, in the majority of cases  before\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner, the dispute is  purely  one  of\r\n\r\nfacts. Points of law are not usually at issue  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the presence of legal counsel  at  such\r\n\r\ninquiries is not necessary. There are also similar\r\n\r\nprovisions prohibiting legal representation  under\r\n\r\nsections 27 and 63 of the Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nwhich  include  representation in negotiations  at\r\n\r\nconciliation   meetings  chaired  by  conciliation\r\n\r\nofficers of the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill therefore seeks to achieve\r\n\r\nthis  but allows an employee to be represented  by\r\n\r\nan  officer  of  the  trade  union  of  which  the\r\n\r\nemployee  is  a  member  and  an  employer  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  one  of his  employees  who  will\r\n\r\nusually be the Personnel Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Employers' Federation has requested\r\n\r\nthat   if  an  employer  chooses  instead  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by an officer of the trade  union  of\r\n\r\nwhich he is a member in the proceedings before the\r\n\r\nCommissioner, he should be allowed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch   representation.

It is a judicious measure because\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision for employers to continue  to\r\n\r\npay  their  employees more than what  is  normally\r\n\r\npaid  so  long  as they do not go against  certain\r\n\r\nrestrictions  contained  in  the  Act.  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nsituation is just like what happened in the  past.\r\n\r\nIn  those days it was the traditional practice  of\r\n\r\ncommercial establishments to give extra bonuses to\r\n\r\ntheir employees if they had made large profits  in\r\n\r\nthe financial year under review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if employers want to give their\r\n\r\nemployees more bonuses than normally provided,  we\r\n\r\nshould  afford them this privilege. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned in his speech  that,  provided\r\n\r\nthe  employers do not go against the  restrictions\r\n\r\ncontained in the Act, they are allowed to give the\r\n\r\nemployees extra bonuses. In this way we  can  give\r\n\r\nour  workers  more benefits, and I certainly  will\r\n\r\nlend  my full support to the Bill because it  will\r\n\r\nnot   only  promote  better  relationship  between\r\n\r\nlabour and capital but it also will encourage  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  work harder to increase productivity.\r\n\r\nSo this is a very good measure. Although there are\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions, generally speaking we  should\r\n\r\nsupport those which are beneficial to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provision for the training of our\r\n\r\nyoung  people,  this is also a very  good  measure\r\n\r\nbecause  our young people will become a new  force\r\n\r\nin our industrial development. From being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled workers at the end of their training,\r\n\r\nthey  will finally become skilled workers able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to our national economy. I  feel  sure\r\n\r\nthat  all parents and guardians will welcome  this\r\n\r\nBill  which  provides for the  training  of  young\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Employment (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\naffects,  among  other things, the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  46,  46(A) and 46(B),  which  were  first\r\n\r\nenacted  to  give effect to the implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe recommendations of the National Wages Council.\r\n\r\nThe  NTUC  is  not  only  a  party  to  the  NWC's\r\n\r\ndeliberations but it has also actively worked  for\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of a system of regulating  orderly\r\n\r\nincreases in wages. In making my comments  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill, I have discussed with my colleagues\r\n\r\nin  the  NTUC,  namely, the Members for  Moulmein,\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah, Bukit Ho Swee, Kallang, Toa Payoh,\r\n\r\nAljunied  and Potong Pasir, and they  have  agreed\r\n\r\nwith what I am going to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern, whether as a Member of this House or\r\n\r\nas  the  President of the NTUC,  is  that  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  in this Bill may be unduly prejudicial\r\n\r\nto the interest of the trade union movement and to\r\n\r\nthe  rights of workers to be organised into  trade\r\n\r\nunions. It is appreciated that the present Bill is\r\n\r\nconsequential to the earlier amending Act of  1972\r\n\r\nand  seeks  to  clarify  and  define  further  the\r\n\r\nrespective  rights  of workers  and  employers  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  payment of annual  wage  supplement,\r\n\r\nannual   bonus  and  annual  wage  increases   now\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the Act. My fear  is  that  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill may, without the  intention\r\n\r\nof   the   Government,   work   to   the   serious\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  of  the  trade union  movement.  The\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill I am referring to are those\r\n\r\nset  out  in clauses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and  8  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to include a new\r\n\r\nsubsection  (13) to section 46 of  the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct, making it obligatory for an employer to apply\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Finance for written permission\r\n\r\nwhenever  he  desires  to pay  any  sum  of  money\r\n\r\nadditional   to   the   prescribed   annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement.  In  other  words,  an  employer   who\r\n\r\ndesires to pay more than one month or three months\r\n\r\nof  annual  wage supplement, as the case  may  be,\r\n\r\nmust  obtain  the permission of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That requirement, in itself, is not a radical\r\n\r\ndeparture  from  the  present law  regulating  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  annual  wage  supplement  and   other\r\n\r\nbenefits. If an employer is willing and can afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  over and above the prescribed  limits  of\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement under the Employment  Act,\r\n\r\nit  is  a  simple matter for such an  employer  to\r\n\r\nwrite   to  the  Minister  for  Finance  for   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  permission  to  do  so.  For  such   an\r\n\r\nemployer and his employees, the provision  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  subsection (13) of section  46  may  not\r\n\r\nmake any practical difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where an employer is not willing to pay or\r\n\r\nadmits  that he cannot afford to pay and seeks  to\r\n\r\nembarrass   the   trade  union  representing   its\r\n\r\nemployees,   the   provision   of   the   proposed\r\n\r\nsubsection   (13)   may  provide   him   with   an\r\n\r\nopportunity     to     create     mischief     and\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding at the expense of the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement.  It  is not too difficult to  imagine  a\r\n\r\nsituation where such an employer would protest  to\r\n\r\nthe  union  in negotiations over wages  and  other\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of service that he would like\r\n\r\nto  pay  more  than  the  prescribed  annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement except that he is prevented from  doing\r\n\r\nso  by the Employment Act. And as a gesture of his\r\n\r\nsincerity,  he  would even send a  letter  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, carbon copied to the  union,\r\n\r\nbut  it  would  be  so worded  as  to  convey  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  application  is  made  with\r\n\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious situation may arise where an\r\n\r\nemployer  may be willing and can afford to  pay  a\r\n\r\nmore   generous  annual  wage  supplement  or   an\r\n\r\nadditional sum of money to his employees, so  long\r\n\r\nas they are not represented by any trade union.  A\r\n\r\ntrade  union,  of  course,  in  anticipating   the\r\n\r\nreaction   of   such  an  employer   against   the\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of his employees,  can  claim  for\r\n\r\nhigher  wages to offset whatever loss its  members\r\n\r\nmay suffer by way of annual wage supplement or any\r\n\r\nother  additional payments. The snag is  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  may  allow themselves to be  provoked  or\r\n\r\nirritated by insinuations that they would not have\r\n\r\nlost  such  benefits if they had  never  joined  a\r\n\r\ntrade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, one of the more serious defects of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is that it seeks to prohibit employees\r\n\r\nfrom   asking  for  payment  of  and  to  prohibit\r\n\r\nemployers  from paying any sum of money  over  and\r\n\r\nabove   the  prescribed  limits  of  annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  or annual bonus. But there is  nothing\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill  to  prevent  an  employer,  who  is\r\n\r\nunwilling  or  unable to afford to  pay  over  and\r\n\r\nabove  the  prescribed  limits  for  annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement or annual bonus, from falsely  claiming\r\n\r\nthat  he is willing or can afford to pay over  and\r\n\r\nabove  the prescribed limits only if it  were  not\r\n\r\nfor the Employment Act. Such malice or mischief by\r\n\r\nsome    unscrupulous   employers   can   have    a\r\n\r\ndemoralising effect on workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill seek to make it easier for young persons\r\n\r\nand  children  to  be gainfully  employed  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.   Though  the  Government  is  repealing\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions  for  the  protection  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests   and  welfare  of  young  persons   and\r\n\r\nchildren,  I  have no doubts in my mind  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will reproduce corresponding provisions\r\n\r\nin the Regulations to be made under the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the various sections to be\r\n\r\nrepealed  by  the  Bill have become  outdated  and\r\n\r\ntheir continued retention may work against, rather\r\n\r\nthan  for,  the  general interest and  welfare  of\r\n\r\nyoung  persons and children. In that  respect  the\r\n\r\nrelevant provisions of the Bill are to be welcome.\r\n\r\nI  do not think that any person, whether inside or\r\n\r\noutside  this  House, can validly  object  to  any\r\n\r\nstatutory  provision to make it easier  for  young\r\n\r\npersons  and  children to receive proper  training\r\n\r\nand  acquire suitable experience to become skilled\r\n\r\nartisans  or technicians under the supervision  of\r\n\r\neither the Ministry of Education or the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trade union's point of view, the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill governing the training  or\r\n\r\napprenticeship of young persons and  children  are\r\n\r\ndesirable  in themselves, except for  the  nagging\r\n\r\nanxiety  regarding  the question  of  trade  union\r\n\r\nrepresentation for young persons and children.  It\r\n\r\nmay   be   contended   that   any   training    or\r\n\r\napprenticeship   scheme  duly  approved   by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education or the Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard  would not lend itself to abuse by employers\r\n\r\nand  that the terms of an apprenticeship agreement\r\n\r\nare incompatible with the principles of collective\r\n\r\nbargaining.  If  it  is the fear  of  any  person,\r\n\r\ninside  or outside this House, that representation\r\n\r\nby  trade unions would upset the proper conduct of\r\n\r\nany  apprenticeship scheme, I can assure him  that\r\n\r\nthe NTUC would not tolerate any attempt by any  of\r\n\r\nits affiliated unions to meddle with the terms  of\r\n\r\nservice  set  out  in an apprenticeship  agreement\r\n\r\nduly approved by the Ministry of Education or  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training Board. But it should  not  be\r\n\r\nforgotten   that   under   the   Employment    Act\r\n\r\napprentices  have been accorded the  right  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  a  trade  union,  even  if   such\r\n\r\nrepresentation may be confined to safeguarding the\r\n\r\nsafety and welfare of apprentices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of NTUC is not directed so much to\r\n\r\nthe  young  persons  and children  who  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  a  training scheme or  apprenticeship\r\n\r\nscheme  duly approved by the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nor  the  Industrial Training Board, but  to  those\r\n\r\nyoung  persons  and children who are  employed  in\r\n\r\nsmall  private establishments without the  benefit\r\n\r\nof    any   proper   training   scheme   or    any\r\n\r\napprenticeship agreement. Such young  persons  and\r\n\r\nchildren  would be completely at the tender  mercy\r\n\r\nof  their  respective employers. I have no  doubts\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Labour may include suitable\r\n\r\nprovisions   in   the  proposed  Regulations   and\r\n\r\ninstruct  the  Labour Inspectorate  especially  to\r\n\r\nlook  after the interest and welfare of such young\r\n\r\npersons  and  children. It  would,  however,  make\r\n\r\nmatters  easier  for all concerned  if  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  are  permitted  also  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterest  and  welfare of such young  persons  and\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, it prohibits trade unions\r\n\r\nfrom  representing workers below  the  age  of  18\r\n\r\nyears. But with the enactment of this Bill, it  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged  that the number of workers between  the\r\n\r\nages  of 12 and 18 years may considerably increase\r\n\r\nin  proportion to the total number of  workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic.  It is, therefore,  desirable  that\r\n\r\nsuch  workers should be allowed to be  represented\r\n\r\nby  trade unions. Any fear that young persons  and\r\n\r\nchildren, because of their tender years, may  lend\r\n\r\nthemselves  to exploitation by trade  unions  with\r\n\r\nulterior  motives,  may be  put  at  rest  by  the\r\n\r\nimposition of conditions that young workers  below\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 18 years may not participate  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of a trade union or in the conduct  of\r\n\r\nany industrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, if this Bill is adopted by this House\r\n\r\nwithout  a  corresponding amendment to  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Act  to reduce the minimum  age  of  trade\r\n\r\nunion  membership from 18 years to a lower age,  a\r\n\r\nsituation may arise which may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlend   itself   to  exploitation  by  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers. There is nothing, for instance, in this\r\n\r\nBill  or  in  the  Employment Act  to  prevent  an\r\n\r\nemployer  from  retrenching  or  terminating   the\r\n\r\nservice  of  young workers as soon  as  they  have\r\n\r\nattained  the  age of 18 years. In  this  way,  an\r\n\r\nunscrupulous   employer  may  assure   himself   a\r\n\r\nconstant supply of sweat-shop labour which  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  organised  into trade unions. In  making  this\r\n\r\nrequest  to  the Minister for Labour  to  consider\r\n\r\nmore  seriously  the reduction  of  the  statutory\r\n\r\nminimum  age  for trade union membership,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  encouraged by the provision of clause 13  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill which seeks to rule out the participation\r\n\r\nof  advocates and solicitors in proceedings before\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour and  which  seeks  to\r\n\r\nassure  a  trade union the right to represent  its\r\n\r\nmembers in such proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Boon Teck, who is also the President of NTUC.\r\n\r\nI  agree with what he has said, but I wish to make\r\n\r\na further comment on the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 2 of the Bill, the proposed paragraph\r\n\r\n(c)  of  subsection  (10) of  section  46  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act seeks to make it illegal  for  any\r\n\r\nsum  of money to be paid in addition to the annual\r\n\r\nwage  supplement  as  set out  in  a  contract  of\r\n\r\nservice  or in a collective agreement. I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that this particular provision is  intended\r\n\r\nto  rectify the provision in the amending  Act  of\r\n\r\n1972 regarding the upper limits for the payment of\r\n\r\nannual  wage  supplement. But  the  fact  is  that\r\n\r\nbetween  1st July, 1972, and today many  contracts\r\n\r\nof  service  and collective agreements do  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the payment of additional sums of money  over\r\n\r\nand  above  the prescribed annual wage supplement.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many reasons for such a  situation  to\r\n\r\narise. One reason is that an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer  wishing  to expedite the  signing  of  a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement  may propose  an  ex  gratia\r\n\r\npayment  to induce a trade union to forgo some  of\r\n\r\nits claims and so conclude the negotiation for the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement. Another reason is  that  an\r\n\r\nemployer may prefer giving such ex gratia payments\r\n\r\nto  committing himself to a permanent modification\r\n\r\nof the wage scales of his employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that whatever sum of\r\n\r\nmoney  that  has  been agreed  to  be  paid  in  a\r\n\r\ncontract  of service or a collective agreement  in\r\n\r\naddition  to the prescribed annual wage supplement\r\n\r\nis  not  deliberately  made  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\navoiding  the relevant provision of the Employment\r\n\r\nAct   regarding   the  payment  of   annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement or annual bonus. That being  the  case,\r\n\r\nit  will be rather difficult for a trade union  to\r\n\r\nexplain to its members how the situation has  come\r\n\r\nabout, that it is permitted for such an additional\r\n\r\nsum of money to be paid in October 1975 but not in\r\n\r\nDecember 1975, since such additional sum of  money\r\n\r\nhas  been freely and voluntarily agreed to in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  negotiations between the employer  and\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union.  I express the  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will give serious consideration  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  of the provision of the proposed paragraph\r\n\r\n(c) of subsection (10), section 46, in clause 2 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  on  the  morale of  workers  who  have\r\n\r\nconscientiously    and    rigorously     conducted\r\n\r\nthemselves  within  the  framework  of  legitimate\r\n\r\nindustrial relation practices in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel strongly on the points that I have\r\n\r\njust  expressed. It is not because of the possible\r\n\r\neffect of the proposed provision on the members of\r\n\r\nmy   own  union  but  because  of  its  effect  on\r\n\r\norganised  workers in general, particularly  those\r\n\r\nworking     in     the    pioneer    manufacturing\r\n\r\nestablishments.  I am given to understand  that  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  number  of such  firms,  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir healthy financial position and their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwillingness  to provide incentives to the  workers\r\n\r\nand  not  because of any pressure brought to  hear\r\n\r\nupon  them  by the union, are willing to  pay  and\r\n\r\nhave, in fact, paid more than the prescribed limit\r\n\r\nof  annual wage supplement to their employees.  It\r\n\r\nwill  require  no  effort for  the  management  to\r\n\r\nreconcile  itself  to  any  statutory  prohibition\r\n\r\nagainst  the  payment of such  additional  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  and  to apply for permission to  make  such\r\n\r\npayment.   But   for  the  workers  to   reconcile\r\n\r\nthemselves  to the suspense of waiting  again  for\r\n\r\nthe  employer to pay the additional sum  of  money\r\n\r\npreviously  negotiated  for  and  agreed  to   may\r\n\r\nrequire super-human efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of that consideration, I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of the proposed paragraph  (c)  of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (10)  be  reworded  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\nequitable to workers who have legitimately come to\r\n\r\nenjoy   such  greater  benefits  than   would   be\r\n\r\npermitted in the Bill as it stands at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments expressed by the Member  for  Boon\r\n\r\nTeck as well as to give my support to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to elaborate a little\r\n\r\non  clause 6 of the Bill which seeks to repeal and\r\n\r\nto  re-enact sections 68 and 69 of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct.  Clause 6 seeks to allow children of 12 years\r\n\r\nand  above  to  accept gainful employment  in  any\r\n\r\nindustrial undertaking. Sir, I have had on several\r\n\r\noccasions  both  inside  and  outside  this  House\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  there is  a  dire  need  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education to look into the question of\r\n\r\naccommodating  students, who could not  go  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  primary  or  secondary level,  in  vocational\r\n\r\ntraining  institutions.

This point  has  been\r\n\r\namply  elaborated on by my Friend, the Member  for\r\n\r\nBoon  Teck.  However, what I cannot understand  is\r\n\r\nthat  when  I  made the suggestion  that  the  ITB\r\n\r\nshould  conduct courses leading to certain  levels\r\n\r\nof  skills,  it was flatly turned down almost  the\r\n\r\nday  after my suggestion was made. And here,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  this Employment (Amendment)  Bill  which\r\n\r\nseeks to do just that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck mentioned just now that\r\n\r\nhe  and  his trade union colleagues are  concerned\r\n\r\nwith this provision for children above the age  of\r\n\r\n12  to  be  gainfully employed in  any  industrial\r\n\r\nundertaking. I too am concerned. To me, this would\r\n\r\nmean  that certain skills have got to be  acquired\r\n\r\nat  a  tender age, and there are various types  of\r\n\r\nskills  available  to  fit  into  this  particular\r\n\r\nscheme.  I do not think there will be exploitation\r\n\r\nof  young  labour  by  employers  because  certain\r\n\r\nskills  are rather specialised in nature  and  its\r\n\r\nsupply may be limited. In the long run, the  child\r\n\r\nconcerned will benefit from his apprenticeship  or\r\n\r\nfrom  his  course of training. It is the  ultimate\r\n\r\nthat Singapore looks forward to because we do  not\r\n\r\nhave, apart from human resources, other sources to\r\n\r\nrely  on.  Therefore, every person  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  so-called  dropouts   and   their\r\n\r\nparents,  should realise that everyone must, work\r\n\r\nfor  a living and, as the Prime Minister has said,\r\n\r\n\"The world does not owe us a living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a very minor point to\r\n\r\nmake  on  this  amendment Bill. If  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  it appears that if an employer wishes  to\r\n\r\npay  a  bigger  bonus  or  a  bigger  annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement he should apply for approval  from  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister to do so. The Finance Minister is\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  the economy of the State.  If  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  bad, the Finance Minister might  say,\r\n\r\n\"All  right,  this year we allow  the  workers  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  5%.\"  But  why  should  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  be  in  charge  of  the  economy  of   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  organisation?

Any employer who is foolish  enough  to\r\n\r\nresort  to  such a tactic will find that  he  will\r\n\r\nhave   a  lot  of  questions  to  answer  and   an\r\n\r\nunsympathetic Government to contend with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also expressed concern that some\r\n\r\nunscrupulous employers may offer their  workers  a\r\n\r\nmore generous annual wage supplement in return for\r\n\r\nnot  joining a trade union. I am afraid this is  a\r\n\r\nproblem that all unions have to face up to at  all\r\n\r\ntimes.   This   is  not  a  problem  peculiar   to\r\n\r\nSingapore. Unions must expect such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndivisive tactics from anti-union employers. It  is\r\n\r\nup   to   union  officials  to  expose  the   true\r\n\r\nintentions  of such employers and to convince  the\r\n\r\nworkers  that  their long-term  interest  lies  in\r\n\r\njoining the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to reiterate once again that the question\r\n\r\nof  bonuses  has  been disposed of  in  1972  when\r\n\r\namendments were made to the Employment  Act  based\r\n\r\non  the  recommendations  of  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil.  The  quantum of bonuses then  prevailing\r\n\r\nwas  converted  into annual wage  supplements  and\r\n\r\nfrozen  at various levels as prescribed in section\r\n\r\n46.  The Government has no intention to reopen the\r\n\r\nwhole  question of bonuses again as it  would,  in\r\n\r\nthe  words  of the Secretary-General,  NTUC,  mean\r\n\r\n\"the  resurgence of the previous  bonus  chaos  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's wage structure by providing  a  recipe\r\n\r\nfor   an  industrial  free-for-all\".  Instead   of\r\n\r\nlabouring on the question of bonuses or additional\r\n\r\npayments or ex gratia payments, it would  be  more\r\n\r\nhelpful  if  the unions would dwell  more  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of a decent wage for an honest day's work\r\n\r\nrather   than  expecting  extra  payments  without\r\n\r\nputting  in  extra efforts. If, as it is  claimed,\r\n\r\nthere  are generous employers who are willing  and\r\n\r\ncan  afford to pay a more generous wage supplement\r\n\r\nor  ex  gratia  payment  to their  employees,  the\r\n\r\ninitiative for such payments should come from  the\r\n\r\nemployers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the interests and welfare of young\r\n\r\npersons,  I  can assure the Member for  Boon  Teck\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is as interested as he is  to\r\n\r\nsee that there is no exploitation of young persons\r\n\r\nin  employment.  In a small compact  country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  with  a  highly  literate   and   well\r\n\r\ninformed population and a vigilant Government,  it\r\n\r\nis  doubtful that any employer can get  away  with\r\n\r\nexploitation of young persons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout  being  discovered and punished.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not mean that the trade unions  cannot\r\n\r\nplay  a useful role in keeping a check on possible\r\n\r\nabuses   by  unscrupulous  employers.

The\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  expressed  concern\r\n\r\nthat, under the proposed amendments to section  46\r\n\r\nof   the  Employment  Act,  the  Chinese  business\r\n\r\ncommunity would not be able to continue  with  its\r\n\r\ntraditional wage system, which is characterised by\r\n\r\nrelatively   low  wages  and  high  bonuses.   The\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union  Congress  has  also  made\r\n\r\nseveral proposals with regard to the Bill. One  of\r\n\r\nthese  is that the amendments proposed to  section\r\n\r\n46 of the Employment Act should not be extended to\r\n\r\npayments  made  under  any productivity  incentive\r\n\r\nscheme.  It was of the view that unless  this  was\r\n\r\ndone employers would be prohibited from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperating  an  incentive or  productivity  scheme.\r\n\r\nThis   would  frustrate  Government's  policy   on\r\n\r\nproductivity  of labour and deprive  employees  of\r\n\r\naccrued  benefits  relating to existing  incentive\r\n\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has never been the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry to bring the traditional Chinese\r\n\r\nwage  system  or  productivity  incentive  schemes\r\n\r\nwithin  the proposed amendments to section  46  of\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act. The continued operation of the\r\n\r\ntraditional  Chinese  wage system,  especially  in\r\n\r\nbusiness based on family or kinship ties, would in\r\n\r\nmy view not disrupt orderly wage developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards productivity incentive schemes, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has consistently urged that  firms  and\r\n\r\nfactories    must    seek   to   increase    their\r\n\r\nproductivity.  The  Ministry  has,   through   the\r\n\r\nNational  Productivity Board, already  begun  work\r\n\r\nwith  employers  and  unions  on  this  objective.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is  necessary that  some  incentives\r\n\r\nshould be provided for increased productivity. The\r\n\r\nproposed amendment to clause 2 will therefore meet\r\n\r\nthe concern of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of  the  NTUC. Bonus  payments  made  by\r\n\r\nChinese  firms under the traditional  wage  system\r\n\r\nwill  be  deemed  to  be  payments  made  under  a\r\n\r\nproductivity incentive scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the usual productivity incentive\r\n\r\nschemes  in  unionised establishments,  they  will\r\n\r\nfollow  the  usual  process of direct  negotiation\r\n\r\nbetween employers and unions, conciliation by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,   if   necessary,  and  upon   agreement\r\n\r\ndelivered  within  seven days  to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court for certification under  section\r\n\r\n24 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a consequential amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 7 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 30, to leave out \"younger\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"young\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to correct a printing error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 to 13 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time\r\n\r\nand passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROBATION OF OFFENDERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the\r\n\r\nProbation  of  Offenders Act to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of volunteer probation  officers  who\r\n\r\nwill be empowered to supervise offenders placed on\r\n\r\nprobation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of the House may wish to know  that\r\n\r\nthe   Community  Probation  Service   Scheme   was\r\n\r\nintroduced   in  1971.  Under  this  Scheme,   the\r\n\r\nProbation and Aftercare Service enrols members  of\r\n\r\nthe public as volunteer probation officers to help\r\n\r\nin  the rehabilitation of young offenders whom the\r\n\r\ncourts  place on probation. Since the introduction\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScheme,   347  persons  have  applied  to   become\r\n\r\nvolunteer probation officers. So far, 132  persons\r\n\r\nhave  been selected. Of this number, 53 have  been\r\n\r\nput  on  the  job  and 79 are receiving  practical\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's objective in introducing the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Probation  Service   was   to   secure\r\n\r\ncommunity  involvement in probation and  aftercare\r\n\r\nwork.  Probation  as a form of treating  offenders\r\n\r\nworks  best  in a community which understands  and\r\n\r\naccepts  its  objectives, principles and  methods.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Ministry realises that there is a\r\n\r\nconsiderable pool of resources and goodwill  among\r\n\r\nordinary citizens, which could be tapped to assist\r\n\r\nthe  Service in its work. Since the implementation\r\n\r\nof  the  Scheme, we have found that our trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  ability of  these  people  to\r\n\r\nbefriend  and  guide young people  who  have  gone\r\n\r\nwrong has not been misplaced. My Ministry intends,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   to   encourage   further    community\r\n\r\nparticipation and involvement in probation work by\r\n\r\nstrengthening  and  consolidating  the   Community\r\n\r\nProbation Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which this can be done is to\r\n\r\nempower  volunteer  probation officers  the  legal\r\n\r\nresponsibility for supervising probationers. Up to\r\n\r\nnow, volunteer probation officers have been acting\r\n\r\nas   Welfare   Assistants  to   our   departmental\r\n\r\nprobation officers, and they have no powers  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  supervise  probationers.  They  only\r\n\r\nsupplement  the  work  of  our  own  officers   by\r\n\r\nincreasing   the   frequency  of   contacts   with\r\n\r\nprobationers  at  their places of  work,  schools,\r\n\r\nhomes  or elsewhere. The Bill before the House  is\r\n\r\ndesigned to vest volunteer probation officers with\r\n\r\nstatutory  powers to enable them to  work  closely\r\n\r\nwith our own officers in supervising probationers,\r\n\r\nthus enhancing their effectiveness besides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrengthening the Probation and Aftercare Service.\r\n\r\nThe  volunteers  will handle the less  problematic\r\n\r\ncases   with  the  necessary  guidance  from   the\r\n\r\nDepartment.   Our   own   officers   could    then\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on the more difficult cases  and  the\r\n\r\npreparation   of   comprehensive  and   evaluative\r\n\r\npresentence reports for the consideration  of  the\r\n\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the appointment\r\n\r\nof  volunteer  probation officers by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfrom  amongst  persons who  are  not  employed  as\r\n\r\nPolice Officers or Prison Officers. Initially, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  intends  to  be very  selective  in  the\r\n\r\nappointment of voluntary probation officers.  Only\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  demonstrated the right  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the  job and the aptitude  to  work  with\r\n\r\noffenders will be appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends subsection (7) of section 5 of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  which  will enable the  Chief  Probation\r\n\r\nOfficer  to make available a copy of the probation\r\n\r\norder  of  the  court  to the volunteer  probation\r\n\r\nofficer  if  such  a person has been  assigned  to\r\n\r\nsupervise the probationer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 6 of the Act and provides\r\n\r\nfor  the vesting in a volunteer probation officer,\r\n\r\nthe  same  respective  powers  and  duties  as   a\r\n\r\nprobation  officer would have under section  6  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  if  the  latter had  been  appointed  to\r\n\r\nsupervise  the probationer instead.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nthe  clause empowers a volunteer probation officer\r\n\r\nto  apply  to  a  court for the  discharge  or  an\r\n\r\namendment  of a probation order, with the  proviso\r\n\r\nthat  he must first seek the approval of the Chief\r\n\r\nProbation  Officer  before  applying  for  such  a\r\n\r\ndischarge or amendment of the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 6 amends sections 4, 5 and 13 of\r\n\r\nthe Act to provide that:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the work of a volunteer probation officer may\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed by a Probation Committee appointed by\r\n\r\nthe Minister under section 4 of the Act;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a court may appoint, under section 5 of the\r\n\r\nAct,   a   volunteer  probation  officer   to   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the supervision of a probationer;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) another volunteer probation officer or\r\n\r\nprobation  officer may be selected to supervise  a\r\n\r\nprobationer,  if  the volunteer probation  officer\r\n\r\noriginally assigned to his supervision  is  unable\r\n\r\nto  carry  out his duties for any reason,  if  the\r\n\r\nProbation  Committee considers it  desirable  that\r\n\r\nanother  person should be appointed  to  supervise\r\n\r\nthe probationer;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) female volunteer probation officers may be\r\n\r\nappointed  to supervise female persons  under  the\r\n\r\nAct; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) rules may be made which prescribe the duties\r\n\r\nof volunteer probation officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Encik Othman Bin Wok].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend section\r\n\r\n8  of  the Singapore Sports Council Act, 1973,  to\r\n\r\nenable  the Council to establish and manage sports\r\n\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary tasks of the Council is the\r\n\r\nplanning   and   implementation  of   Government's\r\n\r\n\"sports-for-all\"  policy  which  calls   for   the\r\n\r\neducation and involvement of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmasses  in  the regular practice of some wholesome\r\n\r\nform of physical activity. Towards this end, inter-constituency sports tournaments were introduced in\r\n\r\n1972.   The  tournaments  are  organised  by   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council working closely with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  national  sports  organisations  and  the\r\n\r\nsports liaison officers of the constituencies.  As\r\n\r\nthe   sports   programme  in   each   constituency\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  it  was found that  a  sports  liaison\r\n\r\nofficer  working  alone was  not  enough  for  the\r\n\r\nproper co-ordination of sporting activities within\r\n\r\nhis  constituency. In view of this,  Constituency.\r\n\r\nSports  Associations were formed  to  provide  the\r\n\r\norganisational  base for the promotion  of  sports\r\n\r\nwithin  the constituencies and for the preparation\r\n\r\nof  teams  for both inter-constituency and  intra-constituency   tournaments.   To-date,   39   such\r\n\r\nAssociations  have  been  registered   under   the\r\n\r\nSocieties Act (Chapter 262).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of  the  House  will  recall  that\r\n\r\nseveral  meetings  were held in  1974  to  discuss\r\n\r\ninter-constituency sports. Though it was generally\r\n\r\nagreed  that  the Constituency Sports Associations\r\n\r\nshould   be  independent  bodies,  it   was   also\r\n\r\nrecognised   that   to   ensure   success    these\r\n\r\nAssociations  should be managed by  officials  who\r\n\r\nhad  the  interest,  aptitude  and  background  in\r\n\r\nsports.  Members of Parliament who attended  these\r\n\r\nmeetings  pointed  out various problems  connected\r\n\r\nwith the running of these Associations, apart from\r\n\r\ndifficulties in management and in the  recruitment\r\n\r\nof   suitable   personnel  to   serve   in   them.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Singapore Sports Council made  a\r\n\r\nstudy  of  Constituency Sports  Associations.  The\r\n\r\nStudy  revealed that not all Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nwere  in  favour  of  forming Constituency  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations  under  the  Societies  Act  because,\r\n\r\namongst  other things, the registration procedures\r\n\r\nin  forming societies under the Societies Act  are\r\n\r\ntoo  complex and the legal obligations of managing\r\n\r\nan association\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder   the   Act   are   too  burdensome.

Officials serve in  a  purely\r\n\r\nvoluntary  capacity.  They  are,  by  and   large,\r\n\r\npersons with full-time employment and untrained in\r\n\r\nsports administration;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) difficulty in obtaining sufficient funds to\r\n\r\nfinance their sports programmes. The tax liability\r\n\r\non  excess  revenue discourages them from  raising\r\n\r\nfunds.  Furthermore, donations to the Associations\r\n\r\ndo not enjoy income tax relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the difficulties and\r\n\r\nproblems  I  have just mentioned have impeded  the\r\n\r\nspeedy    formation    of   Constituency    Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations and their operation. Needless to say,\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation  would  adversely  affect   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of our \"sports-for-all\" policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 8 of the Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council Act, 1973, will enable the Council\r\n\r\nto   establish   Constituency  Sports   Clubs   as\r\n\r\nproprietary  clubs under the Act, to, ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  \"sports-for-all\" policy  can  be  implemented\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.

We\r\n\r\nknow  that  many  officials  of  the  Constituency\r\n\r\nSports  Associations are also members of Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees and that a number of other\r\n\r\nofficials also belong to other organisations. They\r\n\r\nare   all  attached  to  the  Constituency  Sports\r\n\r\nAssociations on a part-time basis and they  cannot\r\n\r\ndevote   too   much  time  to  the   Associations'\r\n\r\nactivities.   Therefore,   a   simplification   of\r\n\r\nprocedures would enable these people to carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir task more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under the amendment Bill,\r\n\r\nConstituency Sports Associations will be  exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  paying income tax.

This  provision   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  view  of the rapid  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and its impending move to Kent  Ridge.\r\n\r\nMoreover, universities in many parts of the  world\r\n\r\nhave   found  their  circumstances  and  functions\r\n\r\naltered and their operation rendered difficult  by\r\n\r\nantiquated  constitutions  which  could   not   be\r\n\r\nrevised  without  great  difficulty.  The  present\r\n\r\nprocedure  of making amendments is too  cumbersome\r\n\r\nand  time-consuming.  The amended  procedure  will\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  University's  growth  is   not\r\n\r\nhampered or retarded by outdated provisions in the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposed amendments mainly concern\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Constitution of the  University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  as set out in the Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Constitution provides, under section\r\n\r\n5,  for preference in the admission of students to\r\n\r\nbe   given  to  persons  domiciled  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  or Brunei. It is clearly desirable  that\r\n\r\npreference  should  now  be  given  to   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  above all others. The proposed amendment\r\n\r\nseeks to rectify this anomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 13 and 16 of the Constitution provide\r\n\r\nfor  certain  governments and institutions  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented on the Court and on the Council of the\r\n\r\nUniversity, appropriate in the years before  1965.\r\n\r\nThese  outdated  provisions  are  deleted  in  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvision  is  made instead for some  of  our  own\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  namely,  the  Ngee  Ann   Technical\r\n\r\nCollege  and  the  Institute of Education,  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented on the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next proposed amendment relates to section 19\r\n\r\nwhich  provides for the Deans of Faculties in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  be  elected  by  their  respective\r\n\r\nFaculties. The Deans are the key academic officers\r\n\r\nof  the University. They are also responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  general  administration of  their  respective\r\n\r\nFaculties. It is therefore vital that persons with\r\n\r\nthe requisite academic standing and administrative\r\n\r\nexperience   be  appointed  Deans.  The   proposed\r\n\r\namendment,  therefore, provides for a Dean  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed    by    the    Vice-Chancellor    after\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Faculty concerned to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the most suitable person is appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next proposed amendment, which concerns\r\n\r\nsection  42, is a minor one. This section provides\r\n\r\nfor  a  Convocation to be held  annually  for  the\r\n\r\nconferment of degrees. In practice, the Chancellor\r\n\r\nnow  confers  degrees  in writing  and  those  who\r\n\r\nattend Convocation, having already graduated,  are\r\n\r\nmerely  presented to the Chancellor. The  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  seeks  to regularise  the  position  by\r\n\r\nredefining the purpose of the Convocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last proposed amendment of the Constitution\r\n\r\nof the University seeks to delete the whole of the\r\n\r\nexisting section 45 which deals with the Students'\r\n\r\nUnion, and to introduce in its place a new section\r\n\r\n45  on  the  same  subject. The intention  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed   amendment  is   to   provide   a   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  range of organised  activities  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the reconstituted Students' Union\r\n\r\nare  not  spelt out in the proposed  amendment  to\r\n\r\nthis  section.

Every  student  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Union as well as a  member  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  one but not more than three of the  Union's\r\n\r\nconstituent  clubs.  Each  club  will   have   its\r\n\r\nobjectives  defined in its constitution,  and  its\r\n\r\nactivities managed by a Committee elected  by  and\r\n\r\nfrom amongst members of that club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years now, a few student, activists,\r\n\r\nquite a disproportionate number of whom were  non-Singapore  students, have dominated the  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion.  They  have sought to give  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  the whole student population is behind  them\r\n\r\nin   their  activities  espousing  the  causes  of\r\n\r\ncommunist  political  detainees,  interfering   in\r\n\r\nlabour  disputes  and  trade  union  affairs,  and\r\n\r\ngenerally  taking up anti-establishment  political\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new Students' Union Statute, such\r\n\r\nstudents  will  have  to  rally  their  supporters\r\n\r\nopenly  under  the Political Club section  of  the\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union.  They  will  have  to   register\r\n\r\nthemselves  under  the  Societies  Act  like   all\r\n\r\npolitical  parties, and assume responsibility  for\r\n\r\ntheir  political activities like ordinary citizens\r\n\r\nin  politics, without the protective camouflage of\r\n\r\nacademic  autonomy  and student  exuberance.  Only\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  can  be  members   of   such\r\n\r\npolitical  clubs, a requirement which  applies  to\r\n\r\nall political parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the Students' Union will be to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  welfare  of the  entire  student  body\r\n\r\nwithin  the  confines of the  University  in  such\r\n\r\nmatters  as  student welfare and  health  service,\r\n\r\nrecreational amenities, canteen facilities, and so\r\n\r\non.

All the  allocated\r\n\r\nfunds  will  be  retained  by  the  University  in\r\n\r\nseparate accounts for the use of the Union and its\r\n\r\nclubs. The University will act as bankers for  all\r\n\r\nstudent organisations.

As for the\r\n\r\nPolitical Club or clubs, I have already stated the\r\n\r\nreasons   why  they  should  register  under   the\r\n\r\nSocieties Act like all political parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interim provision in the Bill makes it lawful\r\n\r\nfor  the  University to retain Union subscriptions\r\n\r\ncollected    by   the   University   before    the\r\n\r\ncommencement of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Act.

Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer to\r\n\r\nsections of the Bill which relate to the Students'\r\n\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the University of Malaya was constituted\r\n\r\nout of the two component colleges, namely, Raffles\r\n\r\nCollege  and King Edward VII College, for all  the\r\n\r\ntime that we have had a university in Singapore, I\r\n\r\nimagine   it  would  be  difficult  to  find   any\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  students who  have  not  witnessed\r\n\r\ntheir  union  experiencing  some  tribulation   or\r\n\r\nvicissitude of one kind or another. I know because\r\n\r\nI took an inordinate time to get my Degree!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EOGMs (Extraordinary General Meetings) may not\r\n\r\nhave  been held with the same regularity  as  AGMs\r\n\r\n(Annual  General Meetings). But the EOGM has,  one\r\n\r\nmight  say,  become institutionalised. Indeed,  it\r\n\r\nhas  become so institutionalised that, at a recent\r\n\r\nforum  attended by the Vice-Chancellor, the  Vice-Chancellor was asked (I am told) whether the  same\r\n\r\nfacility  to  allow students to call for  an  EOGM\r\n\r\ncontained in the current Union constitution would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  retained  when  the new statute  for  the  new\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union  is passed; not  indicating  very\r\n\r\ngreat support on the part of the students for  the\r\n\r\nUnion leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years another device seems to\r\n\r\nhave  been  resorted to quite frequently,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  EOCM  (Extraordinary  Council  Meeting).  The\r\n\r\ndifference between the EOCM and the EOGM,  as  far\r\n\r\nas  I have been able to observe, has been that the\r\n\r\nrate  of calling for the EOCM in moments of crisis\r\n\r\nis  much more rapid than the EOGM, the gap between\r\n\r\none  EOCM and another, in fact, being a matter  of\r\n\r\ndays.   Perhaps,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   you   might\r\n\r\nappreciate that just as an EEG or ECG can tell you\r\n\r\nthe  condition of a patient's health, the EOCM and\r\n\r\nthe  EOGM rate can be used to judge the health  of\r\n\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motions of no confidence too, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nhave  figured  among  attempts  at  censure  quite\r\n\r\nfrequently   throughout   the   history   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore Students' Union. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Kim  Seng has  himself  had  the\r\n\r\nunpleasant  experience of a combination  of  EOCM,\r\n\r\nEOGM  and  a  motion  of no  confidence.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nstudents   want   a  release  of   tension,   some\r\n\r\nexcitement, at the same time as they make sure the\r\n\r\nUnion is operating in their own interest, this  is\r\n\r\nall fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, recently, events associated with the\r\n\r\nUnion  have taken a more serious turn.  About  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  as a result of the traditional  EOGM,\r\n\r\nEOCM  and  motion of no-confidence,  a  number  of\r\n\r\nindividuals  were  elected  to  Union   leadership\r\n\r\nincluding  Juliet Chin and Tsui  Hon  Kwong.  From\r\n\r\nthen  on  despite  pressing student  problems  the\r\n\r\nUnion seemed to have been directed towards what  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to describe as political agitation.  I\r\n\r\nsay \"despite pressing student problems\" because at\r\n\r\nabout  that time some students complained publicly\r\n\r\nof  irresponsibility displayed by  some  of  their\r\n\r\nfellows,  and editorial comments in the Undergrad,\r\n\r\nnow also known as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHsueh Hseng Pau, referred to a general decline  in\r\n\r\nstandards of behaviour, both social and moral, and\r\n\r\nto  blatant  examples  of vandalism,  hooliganism,\r\n\r\nimmorality  and decadence. Despite  this  view  by\r\n\r\nsome  students  at  that time it  was  decided  by\r\n\r\nstudent  union leaders to try to achieve what  was\r\n\r\ndescribed   as  a  maximum  exposure  to   social,\r\n\r\npolitical, educational and academic issues.  Note,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that academic issues  take  last\r\n\r\nplace.  There  was  also no mention  of  students'\r\n\r\nwelfare and I believe students have commented upon\r\n\r\nthis lack of interest in students' welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this decision to stimulate a\r\n\r\nconsciousness  arousing,  national   service   was\r\n\r\ncriticised.  The anti-bus fare hike  campaign  was\r\n\r\nlaunched.  The integrity of Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwas  questioned,  including my  hon.  Friend,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu. Some agitation against  the\r\n\r\nPress   Bill   was  contrived.  The  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board's  increase  in  service   and\r\n\r\nconservancy   charges  was  severely   criticised.\r\n\r\nAgitation on the ground of issues prevailing in  a\r\n\r\nfriendly  neighbouring country  was  mounted,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in respect of the Johore Bahru squatters.\r\n\r\nThe  so-called  Retrenchment Research  Centre  was\r\n\r\nstarted  and  agitation was mounted ostensibly  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of retrenched workers but, aimed also,  it\r\n\r\nseems    to    me,    at   denigrating    workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that it is all well and good\r\n\r\nfor  students to want to indulge in what has been'\r\n\r\ndescribed as conscientisation. But it seems to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  awakening  that is being  contrived  is\r\n\r\ndirected  overwhelmingly in  the  direction  of  a\r\n\r\nstrident  emphasis on grievances and on opposition\r\n\r\nto  Government action. Some student  leaders  have\r\n\r\nbecome so hypnotised by this development and  have\r\n\r\napparently become so inward-looking that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  able to distinguish illusion from reality.  I\r\n\r\nthink  my  colleagues in the Philosophy Department\r\n\r\nmight describe them as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolipsists. A solipsist may be likened to a person\r\n\r\nwho dreams he is a butterfly and when he awakes he\r\n\r\nis  not sure whether he is a person who has dreamt\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  a  butterfly  or  whether  he  is  a\r\n\r\nbutterfly who is dreaming that he is a person. The\r\n\r\nillusion and reality are confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small group of student leaders complain of\r\n\r\nanti-people  action  by the  Government  and  they\r\n\r\nidentify  themselves  with the  people's  struggle\r\n\r\nwhich,  they say, shall be a victory.  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the  people's struggle  will  end  in\r\n\r\nvictory.  But  may  I ask this  small  coterie  of\r\n\r\nstudents  whom  they  represent:  what  are  their\r\n\r\ncredentials?  In  fact, today they  called  for  a\r\n\r\nsolidarity  rally  and when I looked  out  at  the\r\n\r\nlower  quadrangle, on which they were supposed  to\r\n\r\nassemble for this solidarity rally, I was  greeted\r\n\r\nby  a  smiling expanse of empty green with  a  few\r\n\r\nstudents studiously studying under the shade of  a\r\n\r\ntree.  A  very peaceful sight indeed, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad that a few individuals who have\r\n\r\nsuffered  from a distortion of judgment have  been\r\n\r\nable  to bring the affairs of the Union to such  a\r\n\r\nsorry  state in which, overpowered by the hot  air\r\n\r\nthat  they  themselves have generated,  they  have\r\n\r\nneglected even mundane things like Union finances,\r\n\r\nthat  it is public knowledge that the auditor  has\r\n\r\ngiven  only a qualified report. Yet the  minority,\r\n\r\nwho   are   student  leaders  and  their  personal\r\n\r\nfollowing, do not have the support of the majority\r\n\r\nof  the students who simply want to swot it out in\r\n\r\nthe  library,  commuting between library,  canteen\r\n\r\nand  lecture  theatre and who, despite  their  own\r\n\r\namusement  and  entertainment over the  antics  of\r\n\r\nstudent leaders, seem reluctant to do anything  to\r\n\r\nchange  things  for themselves. But  this  is  not\r\n\r\nunusual. In many other universities, as far  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  occasionally witnessed, it is a few who work\r\n\r\nin  the Union while the large majority merely want\r\n\r\nto  go  about  their  business  of  getting  their\r\n\r\neducation, training their intellects and preparing\r\n\r\nfor a role for themselves in society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where we are concerned, we are facing\r\n\r\nthe possibility that the student leadership at the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore may well find  themselves\r\n\r\nmanipulated  by those who do not have  the  woolly\r\n\r\nidealism of students but instead a clear notion of\r\n\r\nwhat they want, and what they want may not be  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to attempts in the University to\r\n\r\nexpress dissent, and this I did during the  debate\r\n\r\non  the  Annual Budget Statement. I have mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  our students should be warned against  being\r\n\r\npawns  of shadowy individuals who, while espousing\r\n\r\nhumanistic  aims  and freedom,  cynically  exploit\r\n\r\nyouthful  ideals.  It is for this  reason  that  I\r\n\r\nsupport the passage of this Bill. The Union  seems\r\n\r\nnow  open  to  exploitation  with  the  leadership\r\n\r\nexercising  themselves  over  imagined   political\r\n\r\ngrievances  which  have nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the  students  themselves  and  which\r\n\r\nindeed have no foundation in reality whatsoever. I\r\n\r\nimagine that it would be correct to say that  this\r\n\r\nBill  is in a way an expression of a no-confidence\r\n\r\nmotion  in the present way the Students' Union  is\r\n\r\nbeing run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that in future the\r\n\r\nadministration will play a bigger hand than it has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to in the past in the affairs  of  the\r\n\r\nUnion.  In  this respect I can only refer  to  the\r\n\r\nstatement  made  by  the Vice-Chancellor  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  have the interests of the students at heart\r\n\r\nin  respect of the Union. I would expect that  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of  the  students  would  accept   this\r\n\r\nassurance,  and  I  think they do.  I  cannot  but\r\n\r\nreprehend  the  reference made (in a  very  recent\r\n\r\nstudent publication) to the Vice-Chancellor as the\r\n\r\nchief  controller, namely, a man long  experienced\r\n\r\nin  controlling student organisations - a sort  of\r\n\r\nsuper  gestapo chief. This is another  example  of\r\n\r\nthe  kind of distortion a small coterie of student\r\n\r\nleaders go in for. It would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore reasonable to think of the Vice-Chancellor as\r\n\r\nbeing a man of vast educational experience who has\r\n\r\nreached  the top of his profession, whose academic\r\n\r\nabilities   have  been  recognised   through   the\r\n\r\nuniversity bestowing on him an honorary award, and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration, I am sure, realises that with\r\n\r\nauthority  over  the  Union in  their  hands  they\r\n\r\nshould  seek at all times, as far as possible,  to\r\n\r\nmove  in  the direction that reflects the will  o~\r\n\r\nthe majority of the students and certainly towards\r\n\r\nthe  good  of  the  Union and the  development  of\r\n\r\nstudent   community   potential   and   individual\r\n\r\nintellectual and moral qualities in an  atmosphere\r\n\r\nof  academic calm and stability. This  is  what  I\r\n\r\nthink the Vice-Chancellor wants. This is what  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of students and their parents would\r\n\r\nwant.   This   is  what  the  people  want.   This\r\n\r\nParliament represents the people, this is what the\r\n\r\npeople want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks to amend the University of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAct  to  bring it up to date and to make  it  more\r\n\r\nflexible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the Bill seeks to do away with or to\r\n\r\nmodify statutory provisions which were enacted for\r\n\r\npurposes  which  have  been achieved  or  to  suit\r\n\r\ncircumstances which are no longer valid, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink there can be any question as to the need for\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill relating to the\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union,  however, may  give  rise  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of confusion compounded by emotions\r\n\r\nand sentiments. I do not doubt the usefulness of a\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union  or the desire  of  the  students\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  run their Union with  the  minimum\r\n\r\namount  of supervision by the University Authority\r\n\r\nor any other authority. As it is, most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity students have left the running  of  the\r\n\r\nStudents' Union and the various Students' Clubs to\r\n\r\na   relatively  handful  of  students.  There   is\r\n\r\ncertainly cause for anxiety when the few  students\r\n\r\nwho  are supposed to promote the welfare of  their\r\n\r\nfellow  students  can freely  make  use  of  their\r\n\r\noffice   for  other  activities  making  not   the\r\n\r\nslightest bearing on the welfare of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who like to invoke the fashionable\r\n\r\nslogan  on the sanctity of academic freedom,  they\r\n\r\nshould  also  consider  the fact  that  University\r\n\r\nstudents  have no freedom of choice regarding  the\r\n\r\nmembership of their Students' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Students' Union, even after the adoption of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  enjoys a privilege which  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen denied to trade unions in Singapore, and that\r\n\r\nis the privilege of being a closed shop union. The\r\n\r\nmoment  a  student  is admitted to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nUniversity, he automatically becomes a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe    Students'   Union   and   his    membership\r\n\r\nsubscription   is  automatically   and   regularly\r\n\r\nchecked-off  or  collected by  the  University  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Union for so long as the student  is\r\n\r\nenrolled in the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to request the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister for Home Affairs and  Education  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Minister  for  Labour  to  make  an\r\n\r\namendment to the Trade Unions Act and extend  this\r\n\r\nprivilege to the unions? I would recommend my NTUC\r\n\r\ncolleagues  to make the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nand Education a Friend of Labour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provisions of the Bill affecting the\r\n\r\nStudents' Union are seen from the point of view of\r\n\r\nthe  minority of students who seek to continue  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  name  of  the passive  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents'  body for their own ends, it is  obvious\r\n\r\nthat the provisions are unpalatable and constitute\r\n\r\na  threat to their sectional interest. But if  the\r\n\r\nsame provisions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill are approached from the point of view of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  body  of students, it is  patently  clear\r\n\r\nthat   the  provisions  are  necessary   for   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the welfare and  interest  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  body  of  students. The  merits  of  this\r\n\r\nportion of the Bill should not be gauged from  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of noise made by a vociferous minority  of\r\n\r\nstudents  but  should be judged on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the protection conferred by the  Bill  on\r\n\r\nthe   general  body  of  students  outweighs   the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  scope for abuse by  a  minority  of\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the proposed provisions affecting\r\n\r\nthe  Students'  Union can only  serve  to  prevent\r\n\r\nabuses in the conduct of students' affairs whether\r\n\r\nby  the whole students' body under the name of the\r\n\r\nStudents' Union or whether by a sectional group of\r\n\r\nstudents  under the name of one of  the  Students'\r\n\r\nClubs.  For  the vast majority of students,  there\r\n\r\ncannot  be any valid and cogent objection  to  any\r\n\r\nproposal   for  a  more  equitable  and  objective\r\n\r\ndistribution of funds on the basis of a number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  participating  in  the  activity  to  be\r\n\r\nfinanced.  It is a more democratic procedure  than\r\n\r\nthe  present basis of allocating common  funds  to\r\n\r\nany  activity  according to whether a  handful  of\r\n\r\nstudents think the activity is desirable. If it is\r\n\r\nseriously  contended,  as  it  has  been  done  in\r\n\r\ncertain   quarters,  that  the   Students'   Union\r\n\r\nconstitutes  an  integral part of the  educational\r\n\r\nprocess rightly associated with a University, then\r\n\r\nit  is  more  urgent that the students should  get\r\n\r\ntheir  lessons  correct. If a  few  students  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly shown themselves unable or unwilling to\r\n\r\ndiscipline  themselves to shoulder the  monotonous\r\n\r\nroutine  of catering for the welfare and  interest\r\n\r\nof  the general body of students, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  this  House should also shirk the unpleasant\r\n\r\nbut  necessary task of restraining  a  handful  of\r\n\r\nstudents   from   dramatically  exploiting   their\r\n\r\nstewardship of the Students' Union for  their  own\r\n\r\nheroics. For these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsiderations, I strongly support the Bill  moved\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Home Affairs and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Bill puzzles me.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  just now did give reasons  for  the\r\n\r\nnecessity for this clause, but I am sure there are\r\n\r\nmany  other  reasons that he has not disclosed  as\r\n\r\nyet.

This is  a  small\r\n\r\noccupational hazard that he sometimes faces  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment Minister in discharging his duties  for\r\n\r\nthe  good  and well-being of the whole  community.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister in this instance  can  take\r\n\r\nsome  comfort in the thought that the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong,  the Member for Boon Teck and I will  also\r\n\r\nprobably  come  in for some pointed criticisms  by\r\n\r\nthe  Students'  Union  leaders  for  speaking   in\r\n\r\nsupport of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to bring the Students' Union within\r\n\r\nthe  ambit  of  the  Societies Act  has  certainly\r\n\r\ngenerated  quite some synthetic anger  among  some\r\n\r\nmembers of the Union.

It\r\n\r\nis  important that we do not treat our  University\r\n\r\nstudents  as  young,  immature  and  irresponsible\r\n\r\nadolescents.  They  should be treated  as  adults.\r\n\r\nTheir  Union should be accorded the status  of  an\r\n\r\norganisation for adults, no more and no less equal\r\n\r\nthan  any organisation for adults. They must enjoy\r\n\r\nrights   and   privileges,  responsibilities   and\r\n\r\nobligations, no more and no less than any group or\r\n\r\norganisation of adult people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions, political parties and other\r\n\r\norganisations in our State come under the ambit of\r\n\r\neither the Trade Unions Act or the Societies  Act.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the intention behind this Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nbring the Students' Union within the ambit of  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act. It should not be seen  as  placing\r\n\r\nunusual  restrictions on the  students'  body  but\r\n\r\nshould  be regarded as placing the students'  body\r\n\r\non  the same footing as other organisations in the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  As  a  matter of  fact,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  Students' Union is  registered  under\r\n\r\nthe  Societies Act. The People's Action Party,  as\r\n\r\nany   other  political  party  in  Singapore,   is\r\n\r\nregistered under the Societies Act. The fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  is the ruling party today clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  organisations, including political  parties,\r\n\r\nregistered  under  the  Societies  Act,  are   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily hampered or restricted in carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir functions and objectives fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for all the activities of the Students' Union,\r\n\r\nother   than   political  activities,   there   is\r\n\r\nvirtually of no consequence now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the Students' Union has come under the ambit\r\n\r\nof   the  Societies  Act,  particularly  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister has now made it known that he intends  to\r\n\r\nexempt  the  Students' Union and  its  constituent\r\n\r\nbodies,  except  the  Political  Club,  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Societies Act. What it  amounts\r\n\r\nto  in  the end is that foreign students  enjoying\r\n\r\nthe  hospitality of the Singapore  Government  and\r\n\r\ntaking advantage of the facilities paid for by the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will henceforth not be allowed\r\n\r\nto   meddle  in  the  political  affairs  of   our\r\n\r\nRepublic, as some of them had done so far. What is\r\n\r\nwrong with that, Mr Speaker, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5,08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the risk of allowing my\r\n\r\npersonal integrity to be questioned once  more,  I\r\n\r\nwould  nevertheless  ask  the  Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is any reason why  we  should  not\r\n\r\nrefer this Bill to a Select Committee, in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  evident  concern and interest  shown  by  the\r\n\r\nstudents and some of the academic staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I approached the House just\r\n\r\nnow  my vision was arrested by the colossal claims\r\n\r\nof  the  present  student  leadership  that  their\r\n\r\nfreedoms are being fundamentally attacked. In view\r\n\r\nof that fact, may [just make some comments on this\r\n\r\nBill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to make a brief comment on clause 3\r\n\r\nof the Bill and the amendment to section 45 of the\r\n\r\nConstitution, contained in clause 4. Sir, clause 3\r\n\r\nbrings  the  Singapore Students' Union within  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  the  authority of  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties.   In   the  light  of  the   Minister's\r\n\r\nexplanation, many of the anxieties of the  present\r\n\r\nstudent  leadership must surely have been allayed.\r\n\r\nBut  it  seems to me that the big commotion  about\r\n\r\nthis  provision in the Bill bringing the Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  within  the authority of the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties   is  misconceived.  Up   to   now   the\r\n\r\nconstituent bodies of the Students'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion  have all along been registered bodies under\r\n\r\nthe  Societies Act. It seems strange that hitherto\r\n\r\nthe  student leadership has not found it necessary\r\n\r\nto  claim  that  its constituent bodies  have  had\r\n\r\ntheir fundamental freedoms attacked. But now  when\r\n\r\nthe  provision in this Bill attempts to bring  the\r\n\r\nStudents'   Union  within  the  purview   of   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies' authority, this  claim  is\r\n\r\nloudly  made.  I think there is some confusion  in\r\n\r\nthe thinking of the present student leadership and\r\n\r\nit would be well for them if their articulation on\r\n\r\nissues take on a sober and mature note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 45 of the Constitution\r\n\r\nallows  the Council of the University to determine\r\n\r\nhow  Union fees may be applied for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe Students' Union and its constituent bodies. If\r\n\r\nthe Students' Union shows any real alarm over this\r\n\r\namendment, I think it is based on the belief  that\r\n\r\nthe   Council  will  suppress  legitimate  student\r\n\r\nactivities  in  the future, which belief  at  this\r\n\r\nstage  must surely be premature. As I see it,  the\r\n\r\nreconstructed  Council  under  the  Bill  comprise\r\n\r\nvarious  personalities  who  should  be  able   to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  decide  impartially  the  desirable\r\n\r\napplication of Union funds. To argue that by  this\r\n\r\namendment  the  Union  will be  hamstrung  in  the\r\n\r\napplication of its funds is, [think, to start  off\r\n\r\nby  saying that the majority of the members in the\r\n\r\nCouncil  will comprise puppets who are, therefore,\r\n\r\nnot  suitable  for  office in  the  Council.  This\r\n\r\nargument is frivolous and, I think, facetious,  as\r\n\r\nit  passes  adverse judgment on  the  capacity  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  have not yet begun to  exercise  this\r\n\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in concluding, Sir, the point I wish to\r\n\r\nstress  is  simply, or what surely  must  be,  the\r\n\r\naccepted  principle  in the expenditure  of  Union\r\n\r\nfunds.  These  funds  are  largely  made   up   of\r\n\r\nstudents' subscriptions during their stay  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  They should, therefore,  be  expended\r\n\r\nfor the proper interest of the general body of the\r\n\r\nstudents. If there should be an authority  set  up\r\n\r\nto ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  such funds should not be expended wastefully\r\n\r\nor  in  a manner contrary to the interests of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral body, then surely commonsense must dictate\r\n\r\nthat such an authority is welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my full support\r\n\r\nto this Bill. The Bill in no way hinders the basic\r\n\r\nrights  of  our students as citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  a university lecturer I can vouch for the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  vast majority of our students are  hard\r\n\r\nworking,  well motivated and taking full advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  higher  education that we  are  affording\r\n\r\nthem.   Most  of  them  are  not  concerned   with\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union  politics. As  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  they are only a small  minority  of\r\n\r\nradicals, most of whom are not Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\nThese  radicals do not realise that attendance  at\r\n\r\nthe  University  is  not  a  right.  The  cost  of\r\n\r\nattending   it  is  very  heavily  subsidised   by\r\n\r\nsociety.  Foreign students are here as  guests  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  paid for by the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  of  Singapore,  as  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people, have every right to\r\n\r\nrestrict whatever freedoms and whatever privileges\r\n\r\nthat these foreign students enjoy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore students, since society is\r\n\r\npaying  for their higher education, let  them  not\r\n\r\nforget  that only a very small proportion  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation    are   afforded   higher   education.\r\n\r\nTherefore, society has every right to expect  that\r\n\r\nboth students and lecturers at the University make\r\n\r\nconstructive use of their time and facilities  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  University should  not  be  used  as  a\r\n\r\nprivileged, a protected political platform.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, Sir, the Minister in his statement\r\n\r\nhas  generously  allowed  for  the  formation   of\r\n\r\npolitical  clubs  in the University.  These  clubs\r\n\r\nwill allow the students to express themselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitically and would serve as an outlet for their\r\n\r\nexuberance,  for  their  social  concern  and   to\r\n\r\nincrease or heighten their political awareness  in\r\n\r\ntheir  capacity as citizens of Singapore. I  would\r\n\r\nhope  that our student leaders will learn  quickly\r\n\r\nthat  to be truly influential the leadership  must\r\n\r\nbe  sound, must be constructive, and their honesty\r\n\r\nand integrity must he beyond question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent meeting between the Vice-Chancellor\r\n\r\nand   the  students,  the  question  of  financial\r\n\r\nprobity  was  raised because the auditors'  report\r\n\r\nindicated  some malpractices and misuse  of  Union\r\n\r\nfunds. This is something which I am very disturbed\r\n\r\nand  very concerned about as a University teacher,\r\n\r\nbecause  if the younger people with the  intellect\r\n\r\nand  with  higher education do not have  financial\r\n\r\nresponsibility   and  are  not  able   to   assert\r\n\r\nleadership   which  is  sound,  constructive   and\r\n\r\nhonest,  then  what  kind of leadership  can  they\r\n\r\nsubsequently  offer  to the people  of  Singapore?\r\n\r\nSir,   as   I  look  at  their  publications   and\r\n\r\nstatements,  I  find  that  they  do  not  reflect\r\n\r\nappropriately  the  intellectual  standing  of   a\r\n\r\nUniversity.  The intellectual and factual  content\r\n\r\nof  debate is appallingly low. The standard of the\r\n\r\nUndergrad,  in  particular, has deteriorated  over\r\n\r\nthe  years.  The articles which are published  are\r\n\r\nemotional  and full of ideological blinkers.  They\r\n\r\ndo  not reflect what the students have been taught\r\n\r\nat  the  University, and I have challenged my  own\r\n\r\nstudents   often  to  make  use  of  the  economic\r\n\r\nprinciples  that  I have taught them  to  appraise\r\n\r\neconomic  policies and problems of  Singapore,  of\r\n\r\nthe region and of the world. I challenged them  to\r\n\r\nmake constructive replies to the garbage which  is\r\n\r\nthrown  up in the Undergrad from time to  time  on\r\n\r\nall  manners  of  social, political  and  economic\r\n\r\nissues. If our students really want to make  their\r\n\r\nvoices heard and want to make an impression on the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and in the world  at  large,\r\n\r\nthen  they  should  be able to meet  argument  for\r\n\r\nargument and to present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacts  and to confront whatever opposing arguments\r\n\r\nin a manner befitting people who have received the\r\n\r\nbenefit of higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have appeared at many University forums\r\n\r\nand  debates  and  I  have found  that  the  great\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our  students are rational  and  are\r\n\r\nresponsive and responsible, and if we can  somehow\r\n\r\nreach  out  to them to try and explain  things  to\r\n\r\nthem,   try  to  reason  with  them  in  a  proper\r\n\r\ndialogue,  my  own feeling is that  many  of  them\r\n\r\nwould  respond. Unfortunately, it is  the  radical\r\n\r\nlecturers and so on who seem to make the effort to\r\n\r\nreach  out to these students. But fortunately  the\r\n\r\nvast majority do not respond to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  those Members who have come out  positively\r\n\r\nin  support of this Bill, and I believe  that  the\r\n\r\nsupport is quite overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just touch on the speech by the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong?   He   has  put  his  points   much   more\r\n\r\npicturesquely in support of the Bill. I believe he\r\n\r\nis  able  to  do so because, as he  said,  he  had\r\n\r\nwatched what happened from his office in the Extra-mural   Department,  which  overlooks  the   lower\r\n\r\nquadrangle where they held rallies. As such, I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure he speaks with solid experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It now, leaves me to answer two questions which\r\n\r\nhave  been raised by Members. The Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  wants to know why we do not propose to refer\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  to a Select Committee. There  are  two\r\n\r\nreasons. The first is that it is quite a clear-cut\r\n\r\nBill.   There   is  no  controversy   except   the\r\n\r\ncontroversy thrown up, as stated by Members, by  a\r\n\r\ncoterie  or  a  small group of vociferous  student\r\n\r\nleaders   who  want  to  cloud  the   issue   with\r\n\r\ndistortions. Secondly, this Bill is merely  making\r\n\r\nthe  formal amendments. After the passing of  this\r\n\r\nBill, as far as the Students' Union is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned,  a statute will have to be  enacted  by\r\n\r\nthe  University Council, setting out in detail the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the new Students' Union  that  will\r\n\r\nreplace the existing one. As such, we do not think\r\n\r\nthere  is  any need for this Bill to go to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir  regarding  funds  which  have  been\r\n\r\nretained  by the University authorities  and,  to-date, not released to the Students' Union, part of\r\n\r\nthe  answer  has, in fact, been  given  by  a  few\r\n\r\nMembers   of  Parliament  who  referred   to   the\r\n\r\nqualified report given by the external auditors on\r\n\r\nthe  1974  accounts of the University of Singapore\r\n\r\nStudents' Union. I understand that the reason  for\r\n\r\nthe University authorities to continue to hold  on\r\n\r\nto the subscriptions has already been given by the\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor when he met the students recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chancellor told the students that he was\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied with the accounts of the  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion   because  the  accounts  showed  that   the\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union  was indebted to  the  Australian\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union to the tune of $45,000  and  that\r\n\r\nthe   Students'  Union  leaders  were  unable   to\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  account for this debt  or  explain\r\n\r\nwhy   they  were  so  heavily  indebted   to   the\r\n\r\nAustralian Students' Union. Another reason why  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  satisfied with the accounts was  that  a\r\n\r\nlarge  sum  of money made out as loans  to  former\r\n\r\nUniversity    of    Singapore   Students'    Union\r\n\r\ncouncillors had still remained unpaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vice-Chancellor and the University\r\n\r\nadministration,  who have a moral obligation  to\r\n\r\nensure that funds collected from every student are\r\n\r\nproperly used for the benefit of the student  body\r\n\r\nas  a  whole, therefore have rightly withheld  the\r\n\r\nrelease   of   the  funds  until  a   satisfactory\r\n\r\nexplanation  from  the Students'  Union  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven to the University authorities, failing which\r\n\r\nthe funds will be transferred to the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents' Union when it comes into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted  to a Committee of the whole House.

The  irreparable damage  caused  by  drug\r\n\r\naddiction  to the health and career  of  the  drug\r\n\r\nabuser  and  the  sorrow, anxiety  and  the  shame\r\n\r\ncaused  to  the family has often been  emphasised.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, need not be elaborated upon here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is not sufficiently appreciated is the\r\n\r\nthreat  that  drug  addiction  poses  to  national\r\n\r\nsecurity and viability. If drug abuse were  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed to grow unchecked, particularly among  our\r\n\r\nyouths,  we  would  eventually  be  faced  with  a\r\n\r\ndangerous national security problem. In no time we\r\n\r\nwould  find that it had penetrated right into  the\r\n\r\nvital and sensitive institutions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nState, like the Police and the Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in fact, happened in South Vietnam during\r\n\r\nthose  tortuous years of undeclared war and was  a\r\n\r\nmajor  factor  leading to its  eventual  collapse.\r\n\r\nDrug  addiction  became rampant and uncontrollable\r\n\r\nthere.  It  not  only sapped  the  spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nsoldiers  to  fight  but  also  undermined   their\r\n\r\nfitness  to  act out what little spirit  that  was\r\n\r\nleft in them. Thus from the very onset they had no\r\n\r\nchance   at  all  despite  their  superiority   in\r\n\r\nfirepower,  military  hardware  and  sophisticated\r\n\r\ngadgetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some indications that there is a\r\n\r\nCommunist  plan  to use narcotics to  corrupt  and\r\n\r\nsoften  the  population of the various  states  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia for the purposes of subversion and\r\n\r\neventual  take-over. It is, therefore, vital  that\r\n\r\nwe take the severest of action now to forestall it\r\n\r\nand  stop the supply of narcotics into the country\r\n\r\nand check the spread of drug addiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rampant drug addiction among our young men and\r\n\r\nwomen will also strike at the very foundations  of\r\n\r\nour  social fabric and undermine our economy. Once\r\n\r\nensnared by drug dependence they will no longer be\r\n\r\nproductive digits contributing to our economic and\r\n\r\nsocial progress. They will not be able to carry on\r\n\r\nwith  their  regular jobs. Usually for  the  young\r\n\r\nmen, they turn to all sorts of crime, and for  the\r\n\r\ngirls,  to prostitution to get money to buy  their\r\n\r\nbadly   needed  supply  of  drugs.  Thus,   as   a\r\n\r\ndeveloping country, our progress and very survival\r\n\r\nwill be seriously threatened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as it is situated, is in a rather\r\n\r\nvulnerable   position.   The   \"Golden   Triangle\"\r\n\r\nstraddling Thailand, Laos and Burma, which is  the\r\n\r\nsource  of  supply of narcotics, is not  far  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Being  a busy port, an  important  air\r\n\r\ncommunication centre and an open coastline  easily\r\n\r\naccessible from neighbouring countries, it makes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetection  of  supplies  of  narcotics  coming  in\r\n\r\ndifficult.  Further, the manufacture  of  morphine\r\n\r\nand heroin is not a complicated process and can be\r\n\r\ndone  in as small a space as a toilet. Our Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau has intelligence information that\r\n\r\nmuch of the heroin brought into Singapore has been\r\n\r\nmanufactured in illicit laboratories clandestinely\r\n\r\nestablished in a neighbouring country. The Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau also reported that there  was  an\r\n\r\nabortive  attempt  to  set up  an  illicit  heroin\r\n\r\nlaboratory in Singapore itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroin is one of the most potent and dangerous\r\n\r\ndrugs. In the first half of 1974 only nine out  of\r\n\r\n1,793  drug  abusers arrested consumed heroin.  In\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding period this year 1,007  out  of\r\n\r\n1,921 drug abusers arrested consumed heroin.  Thus\r\n\r\nthe number of heroin abusers arrested increased by\r\n\r\nalmost  112  times  in  12  months.  This  is   an\r\n\r\nexplosive  increase  by  any  reckoning.   Equally\r\n\r\nsignificant  is  the  fact  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\ntraffickers  arrested for dealing  in  heroin  had\r\n\r\nalso  increased from six in the first half of 1974\r\n\r\nto 26 in the corresponding period this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statistics show clearly that existing\r\n\r\npenalties  under  the Misuse of Drugs  Act,  1973,\r\n\r\nhave   not   been   a  sufficient  deterrence   to\r\n\r\ntraffickers.  In 1974 the Criminal Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act was invoked to detain traffickers\r\n\r\nand  financiers,  and  31  major  traffickers  and\r\n\r\nfinanciers have been detained so far. Despite this\r\n\r\nthreat  of  indefinite detention,  trafficking  is\r\n\r\nstill  rife.  This is because it is lucrative  and\r\n\r\nsyndicates   are  prepared  to  look   after   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  traffickers  and  their  dependants\r\n\r\nwhenever they are caught and imprisoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of this Bill, therefore, seeks to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs  Act,\r\n\r\n1973,  so  that the death penalty will be  imposed\r\n\r\nfor  the unauthorised manufacture of morphine  and\r\n\r\nheroin irrespective of amounts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolved.  The death penalty will also be  imposed\r\n\r\nfor the unauthorised import, export or trafficking\r\n\r\nof  more than 30 grammes of morphine or more  than\r\n\r\n15 grammes of heroin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of countries, including Malaysia,\r\n\r\nThailand,  Philippines,  Burma,  Egypt,   Nigeria,\r\n\r\nTurkey  and  Iran, have imposed the death  penalty\r\n\r\nfor  the  unauthorised  manufacturing,  importing,\r\n\r\nexporting  and trafficking of hard drugs  such  as\r\n\r\nmorphine and heroin. The death penalty provided in\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Schedule  of  the  Bill  is  a  close\r\n\r\nparallel to the provisions in the Iranian  law  in\r\n\r\nthat   the  death  penalty  is  imposed  for   the\r\n\r\nunauthorised  manufacture of morphine  and  heroin\r\n\r\nirrespective of amounts involved, but in the  case\r\n\r\nof   unauthorised   trafficking,   importing   and\r\n\r\nexporting  of  those drugs the  death  penalty  is\r\n\r\nimposed   only  when  the  quantities   exceed   a\r\n\r\nspecified weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1973, trafficking\r\n\r\nis  defined  as  selling,  giving,  administering,\r\n\r\ntransporting, sending, delivering and distributing\r\n\r\ndrugs.  It  is  not  intended  to  sentence  petty\r\n\r\nmorphine  and  heroin pedlars  to  death.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  necessary to specify the  quantity  by\r\n\r\nweight, exceeding which the death penalty will  be\r\n\r\nimposed.  The weights refer to the pure substance.\r\n\r\nFor  heroin any quantity in which the pure  heroin\r\n\r\ncontent is above 15 grammes will attract the death\r\n\r\npenalty.   Such   an  amount   when   mixed   with\r\n\r\nadulterants is sufficient to spike some 500 heroin\r\n\r\ncigarettes. One heroin-spiked cigarette is usually\r\n\r\nshared by a few beginners. Thus 15 grammes of pure\r\n\r\nheroin can do considerable damage and ruin a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  our youths.  As  a  comparison,\r\n\r\nIranian   law  provides  for  a  mandatory   death\r\n\r\nsentence where the trafficking only involves  more\r\n\r\nthan 10 grammes of heroin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also allay the fear of those who may have\r\n\r\nthe    impression   that   drug   addicts    might\r\n\r\ninadvertently be hanged as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  result  of  their having in their possession  a\r\n\r\ncontrolled  drug  which  contains  more  than   15\r\n\r\ngrammes  of  pure  heroin.  The  heroin  that   is\r\n\r\ncommonly  used  by  drug abusers  and  addicts  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is referred to as Heroin No. 3. This  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  sold in little plastic phials, at  $32\r\n\r\nper   phial.  It  is  usually  mixed  with   other\r\n\r\nsubstances  in the proportions of about  40%  pure\r\n\r\nheroin  and  60% adulterants. Each phial  contains\r\n\r\nabout   0.8   grammes  of  the  mixed   substance.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  a  person will only be  in  danger  of\r\n\r\nreceiving  the  death penalty if  he  has  in  his\r\n\r\npossession some 37.5 grammes of adulterated heroin\r\n\r\nwhich contains 40% of pure heroin. This works  out\r\n\r\nto  47  phials. And it costs about $1,500  to  buy\r\n\r\nthis amount at the current retail price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, most unlikely for a person who\r\n\r\nis  in  possession of so much heroin to be only  a\r\n\r\ndrug  addict and not a trafficker. An addict  uses\r\n\r\nbetween half to one phial of heroin a day. Even if\r\n\r\nhe is rich and can afford it, he does not buy more\r\n\r\nthan  two  or three phials at a time for  fear  of\r\n\r\nbeing arrested and convicted as a trafficker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to determine the addictive\r\n\r\ndosage  of  heroin  and  morphine  to  equate  the\r\n\r\nweights  of  these two drugs for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nimposing  the death sentence. This is because  the\r\n\r\naddictive dosage varies from one addict to another\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  individual's  physiology   and\r\n\r\npsychological make-up. Therefore, medicinal dosage\r\n\r\nis  used to differentiate the weights. Since every\r\n\r\ngramme of heroin is equivalent in medicinal  doses\r\n\r\nto  two  grammes of morphine, it is provided  that\r\n\r\ntrafficking,   importing  and   exporting   of   a\r\n\r\ncontrolled drug containing more than 30 grammes of\r\n\r\npure morphine will attract the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although traffickers of morphine and Clause 4 of\r\n\r\nthe Bill makes statutory heroin dealing in\r\n\r\nquantities up to but not provision for the\r\n\r\nappointment of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexceeding  the  specified  weights  will  not   be\r\n\r\nhanged,  the  Bill provides for heavier  sentences\r\n\r\nfor  them than those in existence. Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum sentence for the unauthorised trafficking,\r\n\r\nimporting  and  exporting of opium,  cannabis  and\r\n\r\ncannabis  resin  above  a  specified  quantity  is\r\n\r\nenhanced.    For    example,   the    unauthorised\r\n\r\ntrafficking  of  heroin  from  10  grammes  to  15\r\n\r\ngrammes,  morphine from 20 grammes to 30  grammes,\r\n\r\nopium  exceeding 6 kilogrammes, cannabis exceeding\r\n\r\n10  kilogrammes  and cannabis  resin  exceeding  4\r\n\r\nkilogrammes  carries the maximum  sentence  of  30\r\n\r\nyears  imprisonment and 15 strokes of  the  rotan.\r\n\r\nWithout the amendment such offences would at  most\r\n\r\nbe punishable with 20 years imprisonment or a fine\r\n\r\nof  $40,000  or both and 10 strokes of the  rotan.\r\n\r\nThe  minimum sentence for such offences after  the\r\n\r\namendment  will  he 20 years imprisonment  and  15\r\n\r\nstrokes   of  the  rotan.  The  existing   minimum\r\n\r\nsentence is three years imprisonment or a fine  of\r\n\r\n$5,000 or both and two strokes of the rotan. These\r\n\r\nstiffer  penalties  for the  lesser  offences  are\r\n\r\nintroduced to harmonise with the imposition of the\r\n\r\ndeath penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken to include other\r\n\r\namendments in this Bill. I need mention  only  the\r\n\r\nmore  important  of  these  amendments.  Clause  5\r\n\r\nreduces the quantity of morphine from 5 grammes to\r\n\r\n3  grammes and diamorphine (heroin) from 5 grammes\r\n\r\nto  2  grammes  for  invoking the  presumption  of\r\n\r\ntrafficking in these drugs provided in section  15\r\n\r\nof  the Act. . The morphine and heroin retailed in\r\n\r\nSingapore  contain an average of  40%  adulterants\r\n\r\nand 60% adulterants respectively. Taking this into\r\n\r\nconsideration, the weights are lowered so that the\r\n\r\nweight  of the pure substance is used consistently\r\n\r\nin  defining the offence as well as for specifying\r\n\r\nthe penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector   and  other  officers  of  the   Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau, and clause 8 confers on them all\r\n\r\nthe  powers of a police officer under the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code  in relation to  an  investigation\r\n\r\ninto  a  seizable offence. Clause 6  introduces  a\r\n\r\npresumption that a person whose urine is found  to\r\n\r\ncontain  a controlled drug as a result of a  urine\r\n\r\ntest  has  consumed a controlled drug  unless  the\r\n\r\ncontrary  is  proved. Further, clause 11  provides\r\n\r\nthe  Director of Central Narcotics Bureau with the\r\n\r\npower  to  require a person to attend an  approved\r\n\r\ninstitution for treatment or rehabilitation if, as\r\n\r\na  result of a urine test, he deems such a  course\r\n\r\nof action necessary. Clause 7 amends section 22 of\r\n\r\nthe Act to make clear that a person arrested by an\r\n\r\nofficer  of the Bureau may be taken to the Bureau.\r\n\r\nAll  these provisions are to strengthen  the  hand\r\n\r\nand facilitate the work of CNB officers in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  drug  addicts with a view to  treatment  and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the more severe penalties and some of\r\n\r\nthe  other  provisions in the Bill  are  meant  to\r\n\r\nprovide   the   necessary   deterrence   to   drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers  and  pushers,  there   will   be   no\r\n\r\nslackening in the Government's programme  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the drug problem on other fronts. On the  one\r\n\r\nhand,   there   will  be  greater  deterrence   to\r\n\r\ntraffickers  to cut off the supply  of  narcotics,\r\n\r\nand  on  the other, every effort will be  made  to\r\n\r\ntreat and rehabilitate those who have already been\r\n\r\nhooked   on   to  the  drug  habit   by   improved\r\n\r\nrehabilitation facilities. The Drug Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre  at St John's Island has been enlarged  and\r\n\r\nits  facilities upgraded to take in a total number\r\n\r\nof  600  inmates at a cost of $900,000. The female\r\n\r\nsection  of the Centre has been completed and  can\r\n\r\naccommodate  120  female  addicts.  Now  that  the\r\n\r\nVietnamese  refugees have left, the  drug  addicts\r\n\r\nare now back at the Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government made available to the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Anti-Narcotics  Association  a   former\r\n\r\npolice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npost  at  Rumah  Miskin to be used as  a  half-way\r\n\r\nhouse.

However,  I  am   rather\r\n\r\nsurprised, in fact, shocked, that \"this Bill  will\r\n\r\nnot  involve the Government in any extra financial\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Clause 4 makes statutory provision for the\r\n\r\nappointment  of the Director of Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau  and  other officers of the  Bureau.\"  This\r\n\r\nwill  necessitate an increase in staff  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  this drug problem is solved. Certainly, with\r\n\r\nthe  present staff that the CNB has,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nimpossible for a solution to be arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, \"clause 11 extends the power of the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Central Narcotics Bureau  to  send\r\n\r\nany   person   to  an  approved  institution   for\r\n\r\ntreatment    and   rehabilitation.\"   With    this\r\n\r\namendment,  the Director will most certainly  send\r\n\r\nas many people as deserved to be rehabilitated and\r\n\r\ntreated  to the approved institutions.  This  will\r\n\r\ncost money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore surprising that the Minister has\r\n\r\nnot  taken  this extra financial expenditure  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  ensure  that  this  problem  is\r\n\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It\r\n\r\nhas  become  a  common offence. If this  lucrative\r\n\r\nbusiness of drug trafficking is not nipped in  the\r\n\r\nbud,  our  Republic  may be  accused  of  being  a\r\n\r\ndistribution centre of drugs in this region.  This\r\n\r\nwill affect the good name of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months there has been an increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of unauthorised trafficking of drugs in the\r\n\r\nRepublic,  and  press reports  confirm  that  more\r\n\r\noffenders have been brought' to book. One  way  of\r\n\r\nstopping  this trade from spreading is  to  impose\r\n\r\nthe death sentence. This will give second thoughts\r\n\r\nto anyone indulging in this unauthorised trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I support this Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nto  state  that a situation may arise where  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  surprise  checks by  officers  of  the\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau, innocent people  without  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  may  he found in possession  of  drugs.\r\n\r\nThese  innocent victims may have been  fixed,  and\r\n\r\nthis  might  even cost them their  lives.  So  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  benefit  of  the  doubt  should   be\r\n\r\ncarefully considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a few instances. Recently, I came\r\n\r\nacross  an article in the press that an apprentice\r\n\r\nin  an  electronics firm was charged and convicted\r\n\r\nto  a jail sentence for possession of heroin.  The\r\n\r\naccused  was  also reported to have put  drops  of\r\n\r\nheroin  in  his  fiancee's  bowl  of  mutton  soup\r\n\r\nwithout her knowledge in order to get her sexually\r\n\r\naroused.  She  was  also nabbed by  the  narcotics\r\n\r\nofficers.   Fortunately,  during  the  trial   the\r\n\r\naccused admitted that he had put the drug  in  her\r\n\r\nbowl  of  soup  without  her  knowledge,  and  the\r\n\r\nmagistrate  therefore acquitted the girl.  If  the\r\n\r\naccused had denied this fact, she could also  have\r\n\r\nbeen jailed, though innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case involved a foreign architect who\r\n\r\nwas  fined  by a magistrate's court after  he  was\r\n\r\nfound  guilty of possession of drugs in his  flat.\r\n\r\nHe  denied that he had taken drugs or had  allowed\r\n\r\nany  guest  to  do so in his flat because  of  his\r\n\r\nstatus.  He claimed that social parties  had  been\r\n\r\nheld in his premises before it was raided and that\r\n\r\ndrugs  could  have been left there by his  guests,\r\n\r\nsome of whom had overstayed on different occasions\r\n\r\nbefore he left Singapore for a short visit abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two cases leave room for doubt. The\r\n\r\naccused  could  be guilty or innocent.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen  the death sentence is introduced, care  must\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  see that innocent  people  are  not\r\n\r\nconvicted. Genuine drug pedlars could fix innocent\r\n\r\npeople   by  placing  drugs  in  their  possession\r\n\r\nwithout  their  knowledge and  then  tip  off  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Narcotics  Bureau for  an  investigation.\r\n\r\nArid if a victim is unable to prove his innocence,\r\n\r\nhe is in for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill for the sake of\r\n\r\ndiscipline in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the two hon.

First of  all,  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  the Member for Anson that if a  person  is\r\n\r\ninnocent  and that he is being framed  by  someone\r\n\r\nwho  tries to fix him by putting controlled  drugs\r\n\r\nin  his premises, he need not have any fear. There\r\n\r\nwill  first be a thorough investigation and if  he\r\n\r\nis  found innocent he will not be prosecuted. Even\r\n\r\nif  he  were prosecuted, there is the second line,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the court. A court will not convict  any\r\n\r\nperson  if  it  has a reasonable  doubt  that  the\r\n\r\naccused is not guilty of the offence charged. So I\r\n\r\ncan assure the Member for Anson that persons found\r\n\r\ninnocent will not be prosecuted and sentenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir raised the point\r\n\r\nthat  in the explanatory statement to the Bill  it\r\n\r\nis stated that \"it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  involve  the Government  in  any  extra\r\n\r\nfinancial  expenditure.'.' May I  explain  to  him\r\n\r\nthat the introduction of the Bill itself does  not\r\n\r\ninvolve  any extra expenditure.

Some\r\n\r\nof  the  amendments are merely formal, as  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of this amendment to clause 3. The amendments\r\n\r\nto  clause 5, however, are not formal, and I  will\r\n\r\nexplain the reason at the proper time.

This   concession,   Members   may\r\n\r\nremember,  was  meant  as  an  incentive  for  our\r\n\r\nskilled  and experienced people to go  on  working\r\n\r\nbeyond  their normal retirement age. It  was  made\r\n\r\nalso  in  recognition of the fact that  the  older\r\n\r\npeople  will  need  to spend  more  money  staying\r\n\r\nhealthy and getting to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes an amendment to section 19 which\r\n\r\nwill  limit  capital allowances to a  maximum  of$\r\n\r\n15,000  for those passenger cars registered  after\r\n\r\n3rd  March, 1975, and used for business  purposes.\r\n\r\nThere   will   also   be   several   consequential\r\n\r\namendments  to this proposed limiting  of  capital\r\n\r\nallowances  in  order that it will not  be  easily\r\n\r\ncircumvented.  First,  for  those  passenger  cars\r\n\r\nacquired on or before 3rd March, 1975, it is  also\r\n\r\nproposed  to  limit  further  claims  for  capital\r\n\r\nallowances to a maximum of $15,000. Next, for  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  purposes, running expenses incurred  by\r\n\r\nthose cars costing over $15,000 will no longer  be\r\n\r\nfully   deductible  but  will  be  proportionately\r\n\r\nreduced by the method in clause 4(b). Third, where\r\n\r\ndeduction  is allowable for renewal or replacement\r\n\r\nfor  the  cost  of  replacing a car,  the  renewal\r\n\r\nallowance  in  respect of each car shall  also  be\r\n\r\nsubject to a maximum of $15,000.

Clause  3(a)\r\n\r\nwill,  therefore, subject the President's official\r\n\r\nemoluments to income tax from 1st April, 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken under this\r\n\r\nBill to incorporate some other proposed amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  are  part  of  the  continuing  process  to\r\n\r\nimprove   upon   and  tighten  up   the   existing\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3(b), it is proposed to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  alternative  of  a reduced  withholding  tax,\r\n\r\nbesides  the  present full exemption, on  interest\r\n\r\npaid  to  lenders abroad for loans which are  used\r\n\r\nfor  the economic or technological development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  practice, it has been  found  that\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility  in  the  tax  relief  would  be\r\n\r\nuseful. Certain foreign loans have merits,  though\r\n\r\nnot  enough  to  qualify for total exemption  from\r\n\r\ntax.  At present, there is no alternative  but  to\r\n\r\nsubject such loans to the full 40% tax. It is felt\r\n\r\nthat in such cases a fairer treatment would be  to\r\n\r\ngrant a reduced tax rate if full exemption is  not\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tidy up an earlier amendment in 1973 whereby\r\n\r\ndeductions would not be allowed for life insurance\r\n\r\npremiums paid to insurance companies which have no\r\n\r\noffice  or  branch in Singapore,  it  is  proposed\r\n\r\nunder  clause  8(b) to extend this same  principle\r\n\r\nand  deny  deductions for life insurance  premiums\r\n\r\npaid to foreign governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries impose very heavy tax liabilities\r\n\r\non  profits  of  our  shipping and  air  transport\r\n\r\nenterprises operating in them.

It could, for example,  be\r\n\r\nmistaken  for an Act dealing with postage  stamps.\r\n\r\nClauses 2 and 3 accordingly propose to change  the\r\n\r\ntitle  of  the  Act from the \"Stamp  Act\"  to  the\r\n\r\n\"Stamp Duties Act\" to reflect more accurately  the\r\n\r\nnature of the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, payment of consolidated stamp duty on\r\n\r\ncheques by banks has to be made on 1st January and\r\n\r\n1st   July.  In  practice,  this  requirement   is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  comply  with  because  banks  close\r\n\r\naccounts  at the end of the preceding  months  and\r\n\r\ncannot  always be ready to pay duty on the 1st  of\r\n\r\nthe  following months. Clause 4 proposes to extend\r\n\r\nthe date of payment of consolidated stamp duty  on\r\n\r\ncheques  issued by banks by 6 days. The new  dates\r\n\r\nfor  payment  of  duty  will,  therefore,  be  7th\r\n\r\nJanuary and 7th July in each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware of the inconvenience encountered\r\n\r\nby   statutory   boards  in  paying   stamp   duty\r\n\r\nindividually on a large number of receipts  issued\r\n\r\nby  them. Therefore, I propose, in clause 5 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  to  extend  the  facility  of  consolidated\r\n\r\npayment of stamp duties to statutory boards. As in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  banks, the dates  for  consolidated\r\n\r\npayment of stamp duty by statutory boards will  be\r\n\r\n7th January and 7th July in each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a conveyance or transfer on sale of\r\n\r\nproperty  is  subject  to ad valorem  stamp  duty.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is possible for arrangements  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  whereby this duty can be avoided. It  is  an\r\n\r\nestablished   principle  that   the   stamp   duty\r\n\r\nliability  of  a  conveyance or transfer  must  be\r\n\r\ndetermined at the time when it is executed. Except\r\n\r\nfor  a  voluntary disposition, if at the  time  of\r\n\r\nexecution there is no sale, then the conveyance or\r\n\r\ntransfer is not a \"conveyance or transfer on sale\"\r\n\r\nand  therefore  not subject to  ad  valorem  stamp\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of successful avoidance of duty based\r\n\r\non the recognition of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciple was in the case of William Cory  &  Sons\r\n\r\nLtd v Inland Revenue Commissioner, United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nwhere  an  option  agreement  was  made  for   the\r\n\r\npurchase of shares and at the same time, transfers\r\n\r\nwere  made  \"pursuant to the option  agreement  to\r\n\r\nprotect  purchasers' rights\" but not to \"pass  any\r\n\r\nbeneficial  interest  in the shares\".  The  shares\r\n\r\nwere  held  in  trust for the  vendors  until  the\r\n\r\noption  was subsequently exercised. In  this  way,\r\n\r\nthe transfers were not subject to ad valorem stamp\r\n\r\nduty   because,   technically,   they   were   not\r\n\r\n\"conveyances or transfers on sale\". In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nunder  a similar arrangement, the option agreement\r\n\r\nwould  attract  only a nominal stamp  duty  of  $1\r\n\r\nwhile  the  transfers or conveyances  so  executed\r\n\r\nwould be stamped at $10 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 proposes an amendment to close this\r\n\r\nloophole  and  provide for payment of  ad  valorem\r\n\r\nstamp   duty  on  an  option  agreement  involving\r\n\r\nconveyance    or   transfer   of    property    in\r\n\r\ncontemplation of a sale. The ad valorem stamp duty\r\n\r\nwould  be  refunded if, not later  than  one  year\r\n\r\nafter  the  making or execution of such an  option\r\n\r\nagreement,  the  option is not exercised  and  the\r\n\r\nsale not completed. It also provides for refund of\r\n\r\nexcess  duty paid if, within this validity period,\r\n\r\nthe  sale  has  been completed for a consideration\r\n\r\nlower  than the value on which duty has been  paid\r\n\r\nin the first instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a fee of $25 is charged when any\r\n\r\ninstrument  is brought before the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nStamps for his judgment as to whether any duty  is\r\n\r\nchargeable on that instrument. However, it is felt\r\n\r\nthat an adjudication fee of $25 is too high, as in\r\n\r\nmany  cases  the duty payable may be only  $10  or\r\n\r\nless. Clause 7 reduces the adjudication fees  from\r\n\r\n$25  to  $10  for  any  instrument  not  involving\r\n\r\nimmovable  property.

The Act merely divides insurance business\r\n\r\ninto life business and general business and treats\r\n\r\nas  general business all insurance business  which\r\n\r\nis not life business.

Since   then,\r\n\r\nsignificant progress had been achieved. Except for\r\n\r\ncertain  technical departments, the public  sector\r\n\r\nhas  completely metricated. Conversions have  also\r\n\r\ntaken  place  in  industries.  For  example,   the\r\n\r\nconstruction   and  engineering   industries   are\r\n\r\nsubstantially metric. As for the retail trade, all\r\n\r\nmajor  supermarkets  went metric  from  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1974.  Pre-packed  goods  are  now  available   in\r\n\r\nstandard  metric sizes, textiles are sold  by  the\r\n\r\nmetre  and petrol dispensed by the litre.  Efforts\r\n\r\nare  now being made to encourage housewives to use\r\n\r\nmetric  units  in  preparation  for  the  day   of\r\n\r\ncomplete metrication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our efforts at metrication, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has found it increasingly necessary  to\r\n\r\nregulate  weighing and measuring instruments  used\r\n\r\nin   trade.  As  a  further  measure  of  consumer\r\n\r\nprotection,  it has also been found  necessary  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the  manner  in  which  certain   goods,\r\n\r\nespecially  those pre-packed, are to be  sold.  In\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  these efforts, it is necessary  to\r\n\r\namend   and  re-enact  the  present  Weights   and\r\n\r\nMeasures Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill firstly defines the units of\r\n\r\nmeasurements  permitted  for  trade  purposes  and\r\n\r\nauthorises  the use of metric units  in  place  of\r\n\r\nlocal  and imperial units of weights and  measures\r\n\r\nin  areas  and places of trade as decided  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge.

Because   patent   or    ready-made\r\n\r\nmedicinal  preparations are easily available  from\r\n\r\nshops  and  even sarabat stalls, it  is  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  the  consumer be protected by ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe   contents   of  such  medicinal  preparations\r\n\r\nconform  to  standards  of  safety,  efficacy  and\r\n\r\nreliability,   particularly   when   many   patent\r\n\r\nmedicinal  preparations can be  bought  without  a\r\n\r\ndoctor's prescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection the World Health Assembly at\r\n\r\nits last sitting has called upon member-states  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  a certification  scheme  for  the\r\n\r\nquality control of pharmaceutical products  moving\r\n\r\nin  international commerce.

The powers that\r\n\r\nare  conferred  upon  the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment or the Director of Primary  Production\r\n\r\nin  the Bill will complement powers that have been\r\n\r\nvested  in them under the provision of the Animals\r\n\r\nand  Birds Act.

As it stands, section 74  only\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the registration of premises  other\r\n\r\nthan  pharmacies but are used for the retail  sale\r\n\r\nof medicinal products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\"-[Dr Lee Chiaw Meng]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
