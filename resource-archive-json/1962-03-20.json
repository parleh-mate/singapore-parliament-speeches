In\r\n\r\nthis  connection, I would like to quote  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health  and  Law  when  he  said  yesterday  that\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest was not unique to Singapore.  I  am\r\n\r\nnow quoting from yesterday's Sin Chew Jit Poh in which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is reported to have said that industrial\r\n\r\nunrest was not unique to Singapore. He went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is industrial unrest even in all\r\n\r\nindustrialised  countries in the  world.  In  England,\r\n\r\ncivil   servants,  traditional  moderates  and   trade\r\n\r\nUnionists  are  now in the frontline o the  industrial\r\n\r\nbattle  because the Government had rejected  the  wage\r\n\r\nclaims  to  offset inflationary pressures and  adverse\r\n\r\nbalance  of payments. The industrial strife in England\r\n\r\ncame about as a result of the industrial struggle.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, this paragraph of his is enough  to\r\n\r\nexplain  that  the  arguments  put  forward   by   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to the  Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\ncannot  stand. From this, we can see that liars cannot\r\n\r\nalways explain things away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Has the hon. Member alleged that\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary or any  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  is  a  liar?

But I say that the people who put forward\r\n\r\nsuch  arguments  are really unreasonable  people.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Minister said that industrial unrest  is\r\n\r\nnot   unique   to   Singapore  but  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  said that industrial unrest has come  about\r\n\r\nas  a result of the trouble created by the Communists.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can see that the arguments put forward by\r\n\r\nboth  the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  day  were contradictory. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nremind  Members  of  the  Government  that  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest has come about as a result of the irresponsible\r\n\r\nand  dictatorial  attitude of the Government.  We  can\r\n\r\ntherefore draw the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninference that the Government are trying to  make  use\r\n\r\nof  the  amendment to deal a blow at  their  political\r\n\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to acquaint you with\r\n\r\ncertain  facts  to  prove why their  arguments  cannot\r\n\r\nstand. For example, they talk about Mr Fong Swee Suan\r\n\r\nas  a  man  who  rose in life with a  good  reputation\r\n\r\nbecause of his connection with the Bus Workers  Union.\r\n\r\nIn  the eyes of the Government, Mr Fong Swee Suan  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  Communist and the Bus Workers Union is  now  a\r\n\r\nCommunist organisation. But we can see that for a long\r\n\r\ntime  now  the Bus Workers Union have not started  any\r\n\r\ntrouble to inconvenience the people of Singapore.  All\r\n\r\nthese facts go to show that it is false and untrue  to\r\n\r\nsay that industrial unrest is generally as a result of\r\n\r\nagitation  by  the  Communists.  They  also  show  how\r\n\r\nirresponsible the Government are in respect of strikes\r\n\r\nand industrial unrest. Their argument is that anything\r\n\r\nthat  goes  wrong  in the industrial field  should  be\r\n\r\nattributed to the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Labour was not speaking the truth\r\n\r\nwhen  he said - I am quoting from a newspaper - that there\r\n\r\nwere  about 116 strikes between 1961 and 1962 of which\r\n\r\n96  strikes  were  started by the  Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees Union and the other strikes  by  the\r\n\r\nnon-P.A.P, unions.  He also said  that  most  of  the\r\n\r\nstrikes   were   started  by  the  Singapore   General\r\n\r\nEmployees Union. His statement is not correct  because\r\n\r\nhe tried to describe these organisations and unions as\r\n\r\npro-Communist  and  open front  organisations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this reasoning is really illogical\r\n\r\nbecause the S.G.E.U. and the S.B.H.E.U. are interested\r\n\r\nin  a  very wide range of workers. These organisations\r\n\r\ntake into consideration the interests of thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers. There are many, many workers who are  members\r\n\r\nof   these   two  unions.  Now  if  the   people   are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with their employers, they will certainly\r\n\r\norganise themselves to fight against injustice. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  take the City Council strike as an example.  The\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated  Employees. Union was confronted  with  an\r\n\r\nunreasonable  employer and so there was a  strike.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  leaders  of  the  S.G.E.U.  and  the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U. are  sensible and, reasonable  people  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  they are able to deal  with  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes in a peaceful manner with the minimum  number\r\n\r\nof strikes involving so many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Labour also said - this is\r\n\r\nalso  reported  in the newspapers - that the  Communist-controlled  unions and the non-Communist  unions  were\r\n\r\ndifferent  in their attitude towards the  workers  and\r\n\r\nthat  non-Communist  unions were  more  reasonable  in\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude when dealing with industrial  disputes\r\n\r\nbut   that  the  Communist-controlled  unions,   which\r\n\r\ninclude   the   S.B.H.E.U. and  the  S.G.E.U.,   were\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  I say that the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Labour was quite malicious when he\r\n\r\nmade this allegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from political history that whenever\r\n\r\nthere are any new developments in a country, they  are\r\n\r\nalways  described as bad. For example, when the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas not yet in power, the Lim Yew Hock Government used\r\n\r\nto  describe it as Communist-controlled. And  now  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is resorting to the same tactics used  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government, that is to say, anything that  is\r\n\r\nstarted as new should be oppressed and suppressed, and\r\n\r\na  smear campaign should be started against it.  So  I\r\n\r\nsay that this argument is illogical and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Parliamentary Secretary said yesterday\r\n\r\nthat   pro-Communist  unions  very  often  made  Press\r\n\r\nstatements accusing the Government of using the police\r\n\r\nagainst  strikes.  He  also  said  that  non-Communist\r\n\r\nunions were quite different from pro-Communist unions.\r\n\r\nIs there any reasoning in his argument? I say there is\r\n\r\nnone  because if the workers go on strike and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  aware of its responsibility,  then  it\r\n\r\nshould not use the police against the workers. If that\r\n\r\nhad been the actual case, then there would have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  no need whatsoever for the unions to issue Press\r\n\r\nstatements against the Government for using the police\r\n\r\non  the  workers.  Now,  if  the  Government  had  not\r\n\r\nresorted  to police action, such statements would  not\r\n\r\nhave been made against the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, actually I have a lot to say about\r\n\r\nthis  motion and the amendment, but I feel that  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  of mine will further explain  this  point,\r\n\r\nand I am not going to speak any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes to\r\n\r\nspeak on the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> On the amendment, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears\r\n\r\nstrange  to me that a motion introduced by  me  on  an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue couched in plain and simple language,\r\n\r\nfree  from  high-sounding  and  ambiguous  words,  has\r\n\r\nbrought  forth two amendments, both as wide  apart  as\r\n\r\ntwo opposing forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House to view with grave concern the\r\n\r\nmounting  of industrial unrest. The Member for  Anson,\r\n\r\nby  his  proposed amendment which was speedily knocked\r\n\r\nout   yesterday,   attempted  to   distort   a   truly\r\n\r\ndisgraceful    situation   into    something    highly\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.  And now the P.A.P. Government,  by  the\r\n\r\namendment  proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour, is saying that the same truly\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  situation  is something  for  which  they\r\n\r\nshould not be held responsible, although it is fond of\r\n\r\nclaiming  that it is a strong, responsible Government,\r\n\r\ndedicated to serve the best interests of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  say  there  has  been  a  mounting   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest. The Government  says,  \"Yes,  yes,\r\n\r\nquite  true.  There has been a mounting of  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.  But all this industrial unrest is  caused  by\r\n\r\npro-Communist political agitators for political ends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a responsible Opposition which has the\r\n\r\nsacred  duty  of looking after the well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, it behoves us not to play  party\r\n\r\npolitics in a matter that means life and death to  the\r\n\r\neconomic  well-being of the people of  Singapore.

Personally, as Chief Minister\r\n\r\nin  the  previous Government, and as its Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare who had occasion  to  face  these\r\n\r\nforces  now  described by the P.A.P. as  pro-Communist\r\n\r\npolitical  ends  at  a  time when  these  forces  were\r\n\r\nglorified by the P.A.P. as their comrades in  arms,  I\r\n\r\nam  therefore in a better position than many  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse to pass judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lim Yew Hock Government fought these forces\r\n\r\nopenly  and squarely facing up to its responsibilities\r\n\r\nas  a Government and guided by only one principle - that\r\n\r\nthe  security and well-being of the people is  greater\r\n\r\nthan  the  survival of a political Party.  We  fought,\r\n\r\nbecause   we  wanted  security  for  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We preserved the well-being of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, but we lost in the general elections in\r\n\r\n1959.  And how and why did we lose, Sir? It is because\r\n\r\nthese   leaders   who   form  the  Government   today,\r\n\r\nunashamedly,  as disclosed in ,the 12  Confessions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  over Radio  Singapore  recently,\r\n\r\njoined  forces with these mischief makers and  bluffed\r\n\r\ntheir  way  to power in 1959. I could quote  instances\r\n\r\nupon  instances  of the treachery  of  the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nselling  out the interests of the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  achieve  their own political ends, but  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to  do  so because the people  now  know  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. for what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of Mr Lim Ching Siong. He was a\r\n\r\nMember  of  this  Assembly and yet the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  had the courage, in the best interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore, to arrest and  detain  him\r\n\r\nunder the P.P.S.O. because he was found to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclosely involved in the 1956 riots. And the abuse  and\r\n\r\nharsh words heaped upon me by the Prime Minister  when\r\n\r\nhe  was  on  this side of the House can  be  found  in\r\n\r\nHansard, and I need not quote them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. won the 1959 elections, but it\r\n\r\nrefused  to  take  office until  it  had  secured  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of Mr Lim Ching Siong and his group of  top-notchers.  Not content with their release, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment appointed Mr Lim Ching Siong and his group\r\n\r\nof top-notchers to be Political Secretaries - handsomely\r\n\r\npaid  at  $1,100  a  month each out of  public  funds.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it appointed this group - Mr Lim Ching  Siong\r\n\r\nand  his top-notchers - as Assistant Secretaries in  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. - Ten  Tall Men (tall indeed) - because they  hoped\r\n\r\nthat in this way through the T.U.C. they could capture\r\n\r\nthe trade unions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see today, Sir? Comrades have at long\r\n\r\nlast  fallen  out,  anti Mr Lim Ching  Siong  is  now\r\n\r\ndescribed, in the words of the Prime Minister, as  the\r\n\r\nmost   important  open  front  Communist   leader   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The amendment proposed by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Labour would  make  it\r\n\r\nthat all the industrial unrest is due to Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong   and  his  group,  and  that  this   group   is\r\n\r\nresponsible for the mounting of industrial unrest.  In\r\n\r\nother  words. Sir, it is now openly admitted  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse that the group that caused the industrial unrest\r\n\r\nat  the  time of the previous Government is  the  same\r\n\r\ngroup that is causing the industrial unrest today. The\r\n\r\nprevious  Government fought them and  contained  them.\r\n\r\nThe  present  Government released  them;  worked  with\r\n\r\nthem; accused them; but did nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these facts, Sir, the public can form their own\r\n\r\nestimation  of the standard of political morality,  of\r\n\r\npolitical  integrity,  and of public  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious and the present Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the amendment proposed by the Government, it\r\n\r\nwould  seem that they are putting the blame  for  this\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest on pro-Communist political agitators\r\n\r\nfor  political ends, instead of trying to search their\r\n\r\nconscience and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind out who are the real culprits.

And\r\n\r\nI  say too that the Government is not free from blame.\r\n\r\nHaving tried to get them to work for them, having done\r\n\r\nall  they  could to get them to be on their side,  and\r\n\r\nhaving  used them to achieve their own political  ends\r\n\r\nduring  the last general elections, they are no  doubt\r\n\r\nin  a  better position than I ant to see and  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  these forces are out to destroy them,  now  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  no  longer  with them.

Why cannot the Government come out openly  and\r\n\r\nsay,  there is one group, the Barisan group, and there\r\n\r\nis  the  other group, the P.A.P. group, and  there  is\r\n\r\nkeen  rivalry  in  the trade union  field  today;  and\r\n\r\nbecause of this keen rivalry and their attempt to  try\r\n\r\nto  prove  to  the workers of Singapore that  each  is\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the  other,  there  is  this  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.

They have failed\r\n\r\nmiserably  and  now  they  are  accusing  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   and  suggesting  that  these  pro-Communist\r\n\r\npolitical agitators are creating industrial unrest for\r\n\r\npolitical  ends. In other words, what they have  done,\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are  prepared to do, what they  are  still\r\n\r\nprepared to do is all right, so long as it is done  by\r\n\r\nthem.  But  if it is done by somebody else,  they  say\r\n\r\n\"pro-communist political agitators\". That is  not  the\r\n\r\nway  to  run a government. The Government is there  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the  best  interest  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore; not one group against the other group! That\r\n\r\nwould  be wrong.

The  people  who   were\r\n\r\narrested were people who were found to be indulging in\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities and because  there  was  proof,\r\n\r\nthese people were detained. The Barisan Sosialis  were\r\n\r\non  that side before they left and came to this  side.\r\n\r\nAnd  the P.A.P.

The fact\r\n\r\nthat   there  are  today  still  some  detainees - those\r\n\r\ndetained by me - is sufficient evidence that what I  did\r\n\r\nwas  right and could not be wrong. I do not  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is wrong in still detaining them.  I  say\r\n\r\nthat   it   is   the  responsibility  of  an   elected\r\n\r\nGovernment,  even if it were to be a Barisan  form  of\r\n\r\ngovernment, to look after the security of the country,\r\n\r\nand  in  the  discharge of that duty,  unpleasant  and\r\n\r\nunpopular things have to be done. They have to be done\r\n\r\nif  the  Government  wants  to  claim  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nresponsible and strong Government meant to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the workers.

They   were\r\n\r\narrested because of their other activities which  were\r\n\r\nof a subversive character and damaging to the security\r\n\r\nand  well-being of the people of Singapore. They  said\r\n\r\nthe Lim Yew Hock Government closed down the unions. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  can remember, Sir - in fact, I had  hoped  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  time to go through Hansard - the  only\r\n\r\nunion  that  I  dissolved was  the  Shop  and  Factory\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union led by Mr Lim Ching Siong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat union was dissolved because $120,000 of its funds\r\n\r\nsimply  disappeared.

That\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  true  of  the  present  situation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

But I accuse the Government of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindulging  in  similar tactics of trying  to  win  the\r\n\r\nworkers   to   their   side  by  mounting   industrial\r\n\r\nagitation.  If one were to go through the  newspapers.\r\n\r\none would find this. Take the case of one known P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunion,  the  Singapore Manual and  Mercantile  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion,  a  well-known P.A.P. union, a union  that  was\r\n\r\nknocked out in a secret ballot conducted by the Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment; and yet because it is a P.A.P. union,  it\r\n\r\nwas  allowed  to  call a strike. Take the  Amalgamated\r\n\r\nUnion of Public Employees too. In the Health Ministry,\r\n\r\na   secret   ballot  was  undertaken  by  the   Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The result showed that the  A.U.P.E. was\r\n\r\nnot  accepted by the majority of workers in the Health\r\n\r\nMinistry, in  so  far as manual  workers  there  were\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Yet  the  Minister  for  Health  says  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. can  collect  subscriptions.  Is   it   not\r\n\r\ninstigating  pro-Communist political  agitators?  They\r\n\r\nsay.  \"Look  at  this.\" The Government is  making  the\r\n\r\nground  fertile ion political agitation. We are  happy\r\n\r\nthat we have not made use of this given Opportunity to\r\n\r\nget  the workers out against the Government. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid earlier, a political Party should not, if it  has\r\n\r\nany  conscience  at all, try to lead  or  mislead  the\r\n\r\nworkers to achieve their political ends.

Government is concerned,  it\r\n\r\nis  all  right  to  be a Communist,  you  can  receive\r\n\r\nhonourable  mention  by the Prime  Minister  over  the\r\n\r\nradio  and in publications and newspapers? It  is  all\r\n\r\nwrong.  If  the  Government  believes  that  Communism\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed  in  Singapore  to  compete   with\r\n\r\ndemocratic  forces in a parliamentary democracy,  then\r\n\r\nsay  so. But do not try to describe anyone as an  open\r\n\r\nfront Communist leader with ridicule and contempt  and\r\n\r\nyet  do  nothing about it. We want to  know  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and we want to know it because it has  been\r\n\r\nproved  in  this House many and many a time  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. sometimes say what they do not mean  and  mean\r\n\r\nwhat  they do not say. We will ask them to say in this\r\n\r\nHouse what is to be achieved by the amendment proposed\r\n\r\nby the Parliamentary Secretary. If what is meant by it\r\n\r\nis that the Government have now accepted the challenge\r\n\r\nand  will  fight it out to preserve the  security  and\r\n\r\neconomic  well-being of the people  of  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be with them. But if it is just another  way  of\r\n\r\ntrying to shirk their responsibility and say, \"Oh,  it\r\n\r\nis  not my fault, not my fault. Communist. Communist,\"\r\n\r\nthen  we  are not going to be a party to this kind  of\r\n\r\nmishandling of public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Government\r\n\r\nare   confident  that  they  are  going  to  win  that\r\n\r\namendment.

The\r\n\r\ncentral  figure is a villain usually with  a  sinister\r\n\r\nmoustache  who goes around with diabolical cunning  to\r\n\r\nensnare the innocent heroine into a fate worse than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeath.   His  machinations,  however,  are  inevitably\r\n\r\nfrustrated  by the timely intervention  of  the  hero.\r\n\r\nStories  of  the  Wild West also run  according  to  a\r\n\r\nstandard  pattern. The scene of activity is usually  a\r\n\r\nsmall  town in the middle of nowhere. Large tracts  of\r\n\r\nscrubland  and  desert surround  this  town  which  is\r\n\r\ninhabited  by cowboys, wicked gunmen and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  inevitable  hero. The populace is  terrorised  by\r\n\r\nvillainous  gunmen, banks are robbed,  innocent  women\r\n\r\nare insulted, and the whole little town is reduced  to\r\n\r\na  state  of impotent terror until it is liberated  by\r\n\r\nthe  hero  who, after vanquishing the villains,  rides\r\n\r\noff  into the sunset as the film fades off in the last\r\n\r\nscene.  And  so  Hopalong Cassidy  rides  again.  Sir,\r\n\r\nliterature and films of this kind cannot be considered\r\n\r\ngreat  literature by any standard. But that  does  not\r\n\r\ndetract  from  their merits as popular  entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut  no  one  will  regard cowboy films  or  Victorian\r\n\r\nmelodrama to be serious attempts to portray the  great\r\n\r\ntruth  of  human life. It is just not intended  to  be\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I hear the speeches of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   on  industrial  strife,  I  am  immediately\r\n\r\nreminded  of  the  intellectual  standards  of  cowboy\r\n\r\nstories and Victorian melodrama. There is exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame  utter  simplicity  in  stereotyped  roles.   For\r\n\r\nvillain, read \"the wicked employer\"; for arch-villain,\r\n\r\nread  \"the  P.A.P.  Government\"; for innocent  heroine\r\n\r\nread  \"the helpless worker\"; and for Hopalong Cassidy,\r\n\r\nread  \"Barisan Sosialis\". It is all so utterly simple.\r\n\r\nThe  worker  is  oppressed by  wicked  and  avaricious\r\n\r\nemployers  supported by a villainous Government,  i.e.\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government. Unhappily the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  as  dextrous as Hopalong  Cassidy  in\r\n\r\ndisposing  of his adversaries. So from each and  every\r\n\r\none  of  the  speeches of the Barisan Members  emerges\r\n\r\nthis  grotesque  caricature of what  is  happening  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I venture to suggest that no one except the\r\n\r\nmost  stupid and idiotic of the Barisan Members  would\r\n\r\nbelieve  in this absolute trash, and yet we have  this\r\n\r\ncaricature being repeated time after time in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly, and in the midst of it all, a comedian flits\r\n\r\nacross the stage to declaim -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Harold Lloyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - strikes \"What is wrong with\r\n\r\nstrikes'?

When I was the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  we  beat the world record for strikes.\"  And\r\n\r\nyet the same hon. Member, on exactly the same day, had\r\n\r\npreviously  asked  the Government  why  employment  in\r\n\r\nindustry had been declining over the last five or  six\r\n\r\nyears.  In the face of this assault on our sanity,  it\r\n\r\nrequires  an effort of will to retain one's  sense  of\r\n\r\nproportion  and to preserve balance of objectivity  in\r\n\r\napproaching this question of industrial disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try to put the events during the last 2\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears in proper perspective. Once this perspective has\r\n\r\nbeen  established, then the real significance  of  the\r\n\r\nmounting  industrial strife will be plain to everyone.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  formed the Government in 1959,  we  had  the\r\n\r\nCommunists with us. But we never integrated  into  one\r\n\r\nunified   movement.  We  stood  for  an   independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic, non-Communist Socialist Malaya. They?  The\r\n\r\nCommunist People's Republic of Malaya. On their  part,\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  attempted  to  infiltrate  our  Party\r\n\r\norganisation    while   maintaining   an    increasing\r\n\r\nstranglehold  over  certain  trade  unions,   farmers'\r\n\r\nassociations  and  sections of the  student  movement.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of our office, it was clear that\r\n\r\nwith   the  freedom  they  enjoyed  under  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, they were able to expand their  influence\r\n\r\nand consolidate their position. They always maintained\r\n\r\nseparate identity as a group from which they attempted\r\n\r\nto  manipulate the Government for their own advantage.\r\n\r\nBy  the  end of 1960, we had arrived at the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat   this  state  of  affairs  could  not   continue\r\n\r\nindefinitely.  The activities of the  Communists  were\r\n\r\nmotivated  entirely by their own political  ambitions.\r\n\r\nWhile  paying  lip service to Government  policies  in\r\n\r\nlabour  matters, they always reserved  the  right  of\r\n\r\ncomplete independence of movement and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction  for  themselves. The basic problem confronting\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  the  people  and  the  country  was\r\n\r\neconomic  and industrial expansion. This is  necessary\r\n\r\nto  give  jobs to our growing population. But economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  cannot  take  place  without  stability  in\r\n\r\nlabour-management  relations,  and  because   of   the\r\n\r\ninfluence of the Communists in important trade unions,\r\n\r\nthe Government's policy of economic expansion could be\r\n\r\nfrustrated  at  any  time  the  Communist  wished.  We\r\n\r\ntherefore  wanted to pin down the Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nunion leaders to a firm commitment to ensure just  and\r\n\r\nstable  relations between labour and management.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the  purpose of the series of meetings  which  we\r\n\r\nheld  with  them  and  to which I  referred  when  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  unemployment insurance was discussed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly.  We had agreed with Messrs.  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong  and company on the list of industries in  which\r\n\r\nindustrial stability was to be maintained. This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery comprehensive list and includes all industries of\r\n\r\nany   significance  in  Singapore.  Direct  industrial\r\n\r\naction  was  to  be  avoided in  this  sector  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  The  welfare  of  the  workers  was  to   be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded    by   properly   negotiated    long-term\r\n\r\nagreements where the full apparatus of negotiation and\r\n\r\narbitration  was  to  be  applied  should   there   be\r\n\r\ndifferences  of opinion between unions and  employers.\r\n\r\nAgreement   was  reached  in  principle  between   the\r\n\r\nCommunists and us in January 1961. Further discussions\r\n\r\nwere scheduled to take place on the exact and detailed\r\n\r\nmanner  in which the proposals in this agreement  were\r\n\r\nto be implemented. In this way we hoped to bring about\r\n\r\na relaxation of tension in relations between employers\r\n\r\nand trade unions. This would give a decided impetus to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. Whether the Communists intended  to\r\n\r\nhonour  the agreement and work in good faith to  carry\r\n\r\nout  their obligations we shall never know. But we had\r\n\r\ndecided  then that if they did not do so then we  must\r\n\r\npart  company  with  them on this issue.  However,  as\r\n\r\nevents  turned out, we never reached this  stage.  The\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election intervened and after  that  the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election. In the course of this  latter  by-election, as everybody knows,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  and  the P.A.P. parted  company.  We\r\n\r\nwanted  to pursue merger with Malaya as vigorously  as\r\n\r\npossible. The Communists, on the other hand, wanted to\r\n\r\npursue the anti-colonial struggle, but pursue it in  a\r\n\r\nvery odd way which I, for one, cannot understand. They\r\n\r\nwanted to fight the colonialists not by getting rid of\r\n\r\nthem by independence for Singapore through merger, but\r\n\r\nby  demanding that they remain in Singapore. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  they wanted British sovereignty to  remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore which should be satisfied with internal self-government with, of course, internal security  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the Government. Their stand, of course,  has\r\n\r\nled  them  to an impossible contradiction  which  they\r\n\r\ncannot resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their break with the P.A.P., the Communists\r\n\r\ndecided to attack the Government with all the means at\r\n\r\ntheir disposal. I have already described these attacks\r\n\r\nin detail and I only wish to refer to them in passing.\r\n\r\nFirst,  there  was  a  direct  assault  on  the  Party\r\n\r\norganisation  and  on  Assemblymen  and  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries  of the Party. Here they achieved  notable\r\n\r\nsuccess  as  evidenced by the 13  Members  across  the\r\n\r\nFloor.  They  then proceeded to attack the  Government\r\n\r\nthrough   other   channels,  such  as   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Work  Brigade,  the  middle  school\r\n\r\nstudents  and  the  City Council daily-rated  workers.\r\n\r\nThey  even attempted to manipulate the Chinese Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce. But in all these attempts,  they  failed\r\n\r\ndisastrously. The result of their effort was merely to\r\n\r\nbring  misfortune upon those people who  were  foolish\r\n\r\nenough  to believe them. Some 160 former employees  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Association have lost a useful career and\r\n\r\nare  now  unemployed. 500 young men and women  in  the\r\n\r\nWork Brigade for whom we tried to find useful work are\r\n\r\nnow  without  any  hope. Another 800 misguided  middle\r\n\r\nschool  students have wasted a year's effort in  their\r\n\r\nfutile  and  unsuccessful boycott of the  examinations\r\n\r\nlast  year. So in all, 1,400 young men and women  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sacrificed.  In  the meantime,  of  course,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   were   stepping  up  agitation   on   the\r\n\r\nindustrial front. Strikes were called before the  full\r\n\r\nprocess  of  negotiation  and  conciliation  had  been\r\n\r\nexhausted. What was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnet result of all this? Eventually the workers had  to\r\n\r\nsettle  on  terms hardly better than those offered  by\r\n\r\nthe employers at the beginning. So here again, tens of\r\n\r\nthousands  of workers have been sacrificed. They  have\r\n\r\nlost  many  weeks  or  many months  of  wages  through\r\n\r\nunnecessary  strikes which brought them little  or  no\r\n\r\nbenefit  over  what they could have  obtained  without\r\n\r\nthese   strikes.   My  colleagues,  who   are   better\r\n\r\nacquainted  with  the details of these  strikes,  will\r\n\r\ninform the Assembly of just how the workers have  been\r\n\r\ncheated in these strikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one, least of all the P.A.P., will condemn\r\n\r\nall  strikes  out  of hand. A strike  is  a  necessary\r\n\r\nweapon  of  the  working class so long  as  there  are\r\n\r\nstubborn  and unreasonable employers. But the ultimate\r\n\r\njustification for a strike are the benefits  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  get  from such a strike. The Communists  will\r\n\r\ndisagree with this criterion. They believe - though they\r\n\r\nmay  not say so openly - that a strike is justified even\r\n\r\nif the workers lose by it provided the fighting spirit\r\n\r\nof  the workers is heightened thereby, that is to say,\r\n\r\nthat  more hatred is generated which they can  exploit\r\n\r\nto  strengthen their stranglehold upon the  unions.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  this  is  a  purely  selfish  political\r\n\r\nobjective  intended to advance not the livelihood  and\r\n\r\nthe interest of the workers but the political power of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist open front organisations. By  the  test\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have described, that is, whether the workers\r\n\r\nhave  obtained  improved  conditions  sufficiently  to\r\n\r\njustify  the  loss of income during the  strikes,  the\r\n\r\nstrikes which the Communists have mounted in the  last\r\n\r\n7  or  8  months have not been in the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. All the evidence points to the fact that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  could  have  got as much,  if  not  more,  by\r\n\r\nnegotiation, conciliation and arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way in which workers suffer in\r\n\r\nstrikes. And in this respect, the loss is more serious\r\n\r\nthan the direct loss of an unsuccessful or unnecessary\r\n\r\nstrike. This loss results from the serious check which\r\n\r\nindustrial  strife  applies  to  the  growth  of   new\r\n\r\nindustries. I have already stated on my recent  return\r\n\r\nfrom  Japan  that  the  industrialists  in  Japan  and\r\n\r\nHongkong who are contemplating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  investment  of  capital  in  new  industries   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  seriously  disturbed  by  the   labour\r\n\r\nsituation  here.  I  have yet to  receive  intelligent\r\n\r\ncomment  on this from the Communists and their stooges\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan  Sosialis. Everybody knows  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is mounting the maximum effort  to  create\r\n\r\nnew  industries. The range of inducements which we are\r\n\r\noffering  to  new enterprises is without  parallel  in\r\n\r\nthis  part of the world. Let us not forget that  there\r\n\r\nis  keen  competition  all over Asia  to  attract  new\r\n\r\nindustries.  Unless  we can offer  better  terms  than\r\n\r\nothers,  we  are not going to get new industries.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has done its utmost, and if the result  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  as  gratifying as the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  wish, then the blame rests on those trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  who  mount industrial strikes  for  political\r\n\r\nreasons. The blame rests fairly and squarely on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say this to the growing army of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   unemployed.  New   industries   can   be\r\n\r\nestablished in Singapore which can give you good  jobs\r\n\r\nwith good pay. If they are not coming fast enough, you\r\n\r\nare  entitled to know why. You should try to  get  the\r\n\r\nanswer  from  Mr Lim Ching Siong and his  accomplices\r\n\r\nwho  are  stirring  up  trouble  and  tension  between\r\n\r\nworkers  and  employers. And you will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nunemployed  so long as these men continue  with  their\r\n\r\nmischievous and anti-social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the Government's\r\n\r\namendment to the motion is twofold. First, it seeks to\r\n\r\nexpose  the  political basis of the Communist-inspired\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest in Singapore. Second, it  seeks  to\r\n\r\nshow  the direct loss suffered by workers and the even\r\n\r\ngreater  loss  to those deprived of a decent  hope  of\r\n\r\nearly employment as a result of industrial unrest. Men\r\n\r\nwho  deliberately  stir up unrest for  political  ends\r\n\r\ndeserve the strongest condemnation, as also those  who\r\n\r\ntry  to conceal their mischief by various pretexts and\r\n\r\npretences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  today  we have heard  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  and  the  Minister  for  Finance  and   the\r\n\r\nconclusion we can arrive at is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  playing the same  tune  on  different\r\n\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill accused the Government of\r\n\r\nnot  facing up to its responsibilities in dealing with\r\n\r\nthose leaders it terms as pro-Communist and in closing\r\n\r\ndown  the  so-called pro-Communist trade  unions.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance said that if Mr Lim Ching Siong,\r\n\r\nthe  leader of the Communist front organisations, were\r\n\r\nallowed  to  carry on, then Singapore could  not  have\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and the unemployment situation could\r\n\r\nnot he resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, we can clearly see from the speech\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Cairnhill that he is trying to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  government to take drastic measures to deal  with\r\n\r\nthose  trade union leaders who are really working  for\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the workers. Actually the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  have the courage to shoulder this trade  union\r\n\r\nwork.  But according to the Minister for Finance,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is willing to shoulder this responsibility\r\n\r\nbut  not  alone  by  itself. According  the  him,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for  taking  such  drastic   measures\r\n\r\nagainst the so-called pro-Communist elements should be\r\n\r\nshouldered by the whole Assembly and not by  the  PAP.\r\n\r\nGovernment  alone. It was because  of  this  that  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour put\r\n\r\nforward this amendment to the motion before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past and also at present, the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nbeen saying and are still saying that they are for the\r\n\r\nworkers.

In  order to implement  this  kind  of\r\n\r\npolicy  of  disrupting  and damaging  the  true  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  the P.A.P. must find some convincing pretexts\r\n\r\nso  that the Press and the people will think that  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the P.A.P. is correct and justifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in carrying out this kind of\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities, the P.A.P. has  a  very  good\r\n\r\npretext of accusing these genuine trade unions as pro-Communist  trade  unions, because  it  knows  that  it\r\n\r\ncannot   call   them   yellow  unions,   because   the\r\n\r\norganisation  of such trade unions and  their  leaders\r\n\r\ncannot  be made use of by the capitalists, and because\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  be controlled by the P.A.P. These  trade\r\n\r\nunions  are, therefore, sincerely working hard in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the workers. Therefore, if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants  to brand them as yellow unions, then the  minds\r\n\r\nof  the  people can never be convinced and  they  will\r\n\r\nnever  believe  such accusations. I can  give  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  example.  The  Prime  Minister  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nstrike  at Ford Company. The Ford workers had been  on\r\n\r\nstrike  for  110  days.  In the  end  this  industrial\r\n\r\ndispute  was  resolved. The demand of the workers  was\r\n\r\nmet by getting an increase of 6 cents per hour and not\r\n\r\n6  cents  per  day as said by the Prime Minister.  And\r\n\r\ntheir  bonus  was also increased by 4 days'  pay  more\r\n\r\nthan in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to correct certain wrong\r\n\r\ninformation  given by the Government, I  wish  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  labour  wanted  to  sign longer  contracts  with\r\n\r\ncapital  but  capital  conceded  to  only  a  two-year\r\n\r\ncontract. Therefore, we can clearly see that if such a\r\n\r\ntrade  union is to be accused by the Government  as  a\r\n\r\nyellow  union,  then, first and foremost,  members  of\r\n\r\nthis trade union cannot believe it. The leaders of the\r\n\r\ntrade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions are always on the labour side in their struggle\r\n\r\nfor   the  benefit  of  the  workers.

The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister continued to say. \"Lim Ching Siong  and\r\n\r\nhis  friends wilt resort to industrial action, and are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  use tactics to prevent the Party  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment from achieving their merger policy.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, talking about trade union  leaders,\r\n\r\nthey  can  see  from  this  that  trade  unionism   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  future  will  meet  with   certain\r\n\r\nunpleasant  situations, and certain unpleasant  events\r\n\r\nwill  happen  to  these  leaders.  They  have  already\r\n\r\nexpected long ago the beginning of this smear and  the\r\n\r\nresultant political actions. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  say the leaders of these trade  unions  and\r\n\r\nworkers,  since  the parting of ways with  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nhave  now become more sober in dealing with all  trade\r\n\r\nunion  disputes. The Government is trying to say  that\r\n\r\nall  trade  disputes now have been organised  by  pro-Communist  elements. Such an accusation is groundless.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. Sir, in order to point out to  you  this\r\n\r\ngroundless  smear, let me quote what the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour  said.  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting from today's Nanyang Siang Pau:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary said that last year on\r\n\r\nthe  17th November at the Seiclene Company the workers\r\n\r\nblocked  a military truck for five hours from  leaving\r\n\r\nthe  Company. The strikers under the direction of  Tan\r\n\r\nTeck Wah, President of the Singapore General Employees\r\n\r\nUnion,  prevented the truck from leaving by using  two\r\n\r\nvans to block it. Tan Teck Wah ordered the workers  to\r\n\r\ndo  such things, and to sneer at the police. Later on,\r\n\r\nFong  Swee Suan arrived and persuaded the workers  not\r\n\r\nto insult the police.

If these trade union leaders had  wanted\r\n\r\nto  create confusion, then they could very easily have\r\n\r\ncreated unhappy incidents in such a case. We can  also\r\n\r\ncome to another conclusion like this. If Mr Fong Swee\r\n\r\nSuan, who has been alleged by the Government as having\r\n\r\nclose  connections  with  the  Communists,  wants   to\r\n\r\nachieve the so-called pro-Communist purpose, then  why\r\n\r\nshould  he  persuade the workers on strike  to  picket\r\n\r\npeacefully?

Why should Mr Fong\r\n\r\nSwee  Suan  persuade the leaders of  the  strikers  to\r\n\r\ncarry out peaceful picketing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this we can see that if we\r\n\r\nblame all the present Singapore industrial disputes as\r\n\r\ntactics  by the Communists to achieve their  political\r\n\r\npurpose  and  treat  them in  such  a  way,  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should bear the consequences for doing  so.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, at the same time, the  Government,\r\n\r\nthrough  this  amendment, have clearly  told  us  what\r\n\r\ntheir  future policy will be in relation to these  so-called  pro-Communist trade unions. The object of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not to carry out their past promises  to\r\n\r\nunite  the workers, but to label those who shout these\r\n\r\nslogans as pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very regrettable to hear\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. today could have said  such  things.\r\n\r\nThis  goes  to prove that they are not really  working\r\n\r\nfor  the  interest  of the workers.  They  are  really\r\n\r\nworking  for their political interest and to break  up\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  organisations and their  unity.  But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  these  workers'  organisations  will  not  he\r\n\r\nweakened by Government's smear of pro-Communist or pro-Communist activities, because all along they have been\r\n\r\nused  to  such smears being levelled at their  leaders\r\n\r\nand their organisations. Therefore, this amendment  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is only presaging what they will do in the\r\n\r\nfuture to deal with genuine trade unions and to  shirk\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibility to this Assembly. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nare here to expose their true face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, Communist tactics the world over are\r\n\r\nbasically  similar. In their struggle for  power,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   invariably  resort  to   exploiting   the\r\n\r\ngrievances  and  dissatisfaction  of  the  workers  by\r\n\r\nposing  as  their  champions, and,  having  won  their\r\n\r\nconfidence,  to  deceive  and  lead  them  to  violent\r\n\r\ncollision  with the State. The purpose is  obvious  to\r\n\r\neverybody.  That is to stir up hatred against  legally\r\n\r\nconstituted  authority if it  stands  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\nCommunist   expansion.  Bearing  this  in  mind,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  can understand why  in  any  trade\r\n\r\ndispute involving the pro-Communist unions, the normal\r\n\r\npeaceful   means  of  negotiation,  conciliation   and\r\n\r\narbitration  are ignored in favour of  direct  action,\r\n\r\nmore often than not followed by violence. What is  the\r\n\r\nresult? Misery and suffering to the workers and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  for  the meagre increase in  wages,  if  any\r\n\r\nindeed,  if normal peaceful methods were adopted,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  could gain very much more than direct  action\r\n\r\nwithout  a  great loss and sacrifice  to  the  workers\r\n\r\nespecially  when there is a pro-labour  Government  in\r\n\r\noffice.  But  why  do  the pro-Communists  prefer  the\r\n\r\nviolent  form  of  class struggle to  peaceful  means,\r\n\r\nespecially if they are made available\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  a  pro-labour Government, such as the P.A.P.?  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is that violent industrial action by the  pro-Communists   is  preferred  because  it   serves   two\r\n\r\npurposes.  Firstly,  it  provides  a  recruiting   and\r\n\r\ntraining  ground for pro-Communist cadres. Only  those\r\n\r\ncadres  who have been thus steeled in the crucible  of\r\n\r\nstruggle are acceptable to the Communists. The  second\r\n\r\npurpose is that the resulting suffering and misery  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers as a result of violent direct action will\r\n\r\nleave  them  embittered and, by skilful  manipulation,\r\n\r\ndeceit and false propaganda, the bitterness and hatred\r\n\r\nand  suffering  of  the  workers  could  be  exploited\r\n\r\nagainst the State. Of course, the pro-Communists would\r\n\r\nnot  tell  the  workers that these are  their  genuine\r\n\r\npurposes of an avoidable strike. Instead, they seek to\r\n\r\ndivert the workers' attention by claiming that violent\r\n\r\nclass struggle is inevitable and exhort the workers to\r\n\r\nsacrifice in the violent struggle so as to raise their\r\n\r\npolitical consciousness. Having understood the purpose\r\n\r\nof  agitating workers to strike for political ends  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  surprised if  the  pro-Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the last few months have refused to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  normal channel of peaceful  methods  for\r\n\r\nsettling  trade disputes and preferred violent  direct\r\n\r\naction  which resulted, in many cases, in more  losses\r\n\r\nthan  gains,  as, for instance, the Ford Motor  strike\r\n\r\nand the Shaw Brothers strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is therefore obvious. The sudden\r\n\r\nmounting  of industrial unrest in the last few  months\r\n\r\nsince  the open break with the pro-Communists in  July\r\n\r\n1961  was  more  for political purposes  to  frustrate\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia than for the economic betterment\r\n\r\nof  the  workers. That also explains why prior to  the\r\n\r\nopen  break there were relatively few strikes, and  in\r\n\r\nmost cases peaceful. But after July 1961, there was  a\r\n\r\nsudden  increase  of strikes by pro-Communist  unions,\r\n\r\nand  in  most  cases violent ones without first  going\r\n\r\nthrough  the  normal channel of peaceful  negotiation.\r\n\r\nconciliation and arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when peace is disturbed and\r\n\r\nviolence and disorder take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace,  the  police, as guardians of peace and  order,\r\n\r\nmust  step in to ensure that the life and security  of\r\n\r\nthe  people are not threatened and the people  can  go\r\n\r\nabout  in  their  daily pursuit of  earning  a  living\r\n\r\nwithout  danger. This duty of the police unfortunately\r\n\r\nconflicts  with  the  aims of  the  pro-Communists  in\r\n\r\nmounting strikes for political purposes, and  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why the police, the disciplined arm of the\r\n\r\nState,  must necessarily come under heavy fire of  the\r\n\r\npro-Communists,  be  they in Singapore  or  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the laws of the State are another important\r\n\r\ntarget of attack and hatred to the pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I table a copy of the Suara\r\n\r\nKesatuan,  a fortnightly publication of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees  Union, issue  No.  13  dated  31st\r\n\r\nDecember,  1961. There is no need for  me  to  explain\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore General Employees Union is a  pro-Communist union. The picture in this issue illustrates\r\n\r\nmy  point. The picture on the front page is a  cartoon\r\n\r\nof  the Government in the form of a human being  whose\r\n\r\nright  hand  held a rifle and the left hand  a  police\r\n\r\nbaton, and with his right foot armed with laws and his\r\n\r\nleft foot disciplinary rules, crushing a worker on the\r\n\r\nground.  Is  there anything which speaks more  vividly\r\n\r\nthe pro-Communist thinking than this cartoon that they\r\n\r\ndepict  the  police  and  the law  as  instruments  of\r\n\r\noppression  against  the workers, and,  therefore,  as\r\n\r\nobjects  of resentment and hatred that must  be  swept\r\n\r\naside so that the pro-Communists could have a free run\r\n\r\nin   carrying  out  their  intimidation  and  violence\r\n\r\nagainst  those  who  oppose them? All  other  pictures\r\n\r\npublished  in the front page were specially  taken  to\r\n\r\nshow  the  police in the act of maintaining peace  and\r\n\r\norder  in  all the strike-bound areas where  the  pro-Communist   unions  were  involved.   The   impression\r\n\r\nintended  to he conveyed is quite clear to  everybody.\r\n\r\nIt  is  that the police is an instrument of oppression\r\n\r\nagainst  the  workers, and because the police  is  the\r\n\r\ndisciplined arm of the State in the maintenance of law\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder,  therefore,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  anti-worker. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the speech made by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, it is obvious to everybody that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis is a Communist front organisation\r\n\r\nOut to discredit the legally constituted Government to\r\n\r\nfurther  its anti-nationalist cause. In a colonial  or\r\n\r\nsemi-colonial   State,  the  police  is   particularly\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  attack  for being  the  instrument  of\r\n\r\noppression.  And  the attack made by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  on  the  police  force  and  the  law   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  no  surprise, because nothing  could  evoke\r\n\r\npublic sympathy more than a physical clash between the\r\n\r\npolice  and the workers and the students. If therefore\r\n\r\nthe  pro-Communists  in  the  Barisan  Sosialis  could\r\n\r\ndeceive  the innocent workers through their agents  in\r\n\r\nthe  unions and manipulate them into a clash with  the\r\n\r\npolice, then a classic situation will develop with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  being accused of using Fascist methods  on\r\n\r\nthe one hand and the poor workers as victims of brutal\r\n\r\nviolence.  In  that  kind  of  situation,   the   pro-Communists  hope that they can whip up resentment  and\r\n\r\nhatred amongst the workers and the public against  the\r\n\r\nelected Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allegations have been made by the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Queenstown  that  the   police   force,\r\n\r\npreviously   trained  to  oppress  the  students   and\r\n\r\nworkers,  have been increasingly used by  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  against  students and workers,  especially\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  workers  of  the   Business   Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union.  The  Member  for  Queenstown  also\r\n\r\nalleged  that  the  police have  been  used  to  break\r\n\r\nstrikes  and to protect new workers and employers.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown is not speaking  with  his\r\n\r\ntongue in his cheek, then he is just repeating  a  set\r\n\r\nspeech  given  to  him by his masters  like  a  parrot\r\n\r\nwithout  consulting  his own conscience.  Whether  the\r\n\r\npolice was really trained to oppress the students  and\r\n\r\nworkers in the past, that is no responsibility of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government. But no sensible person is going  to\r\n\r\ntake  this fantastic allegation seriously. That I  can\r\n\r\nassure.  Although no worker in his right  senses  will\r\n\r\nbelieve that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is against workers, nevertheless, it\r\n\r\nis   just   as  well  to  disillusion  the   infantile\r\n\r\npoliticians in the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we first came to power, we\r\n\r\nmade  it  a point to re-orientate the outlook  of  the\r\n\r\npolice. The police were told that they were the public\r\n\r\nservants  of the people whose duty it was to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  property  of  the  people.  They  were\r\n\r\nhowever,  to  deal  firmly  with  criminals  and  law-breakers.  In  their dealings with  the  people,  they\r\n\r\nshould   be  polite  and  tactful.  Their  duties   as\r\n\r\nguardians   of  the  people's  economic   and   social\r\n\r\ninstitutions in a self-governing State become all  the\r\n\r\nmore  heavy than before. The people were told  of  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the police and were asked to cooperate  with\r\n\r\nthem in the maintenance of law and order. Towards this\r\n\r\nend,   political  courses  were  arranged  for  police\r\n\r\nofficers.  Meetings were held where  police  meet  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  have their role in society  clarified.  I\r\n\r\nremember  many  Assemblymen of  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\norganised  these meetings between the police  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Nobody can fail to see that there  is  a  new\r\n\r\nspirit  being instilled into the police.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Assemblymen were the first to make full  use\r\n\r\nof  the  new  spirit of the police until a  difference\r\n\r\nover the issue of merger and Malaysia developed in the\r\n\r\nParty, culminating in the open break between the  pro-Communists  and  their stooges and  the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  There was not a squeak about Government  using\r\n\r\nthe  police to oppress the workers. Indeed the efforts\r\n\r\nof  the police to be friendly with the workers and  on\r\n\r\nthe  side  of  the  people  were  appreciated  and  on\r\n\r\noccasions  compliments were made  by  the  13  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Assemblymen opposite. As  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Health and  Law  cited\r\n\r\nyesterday,  police protection was even sought  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  General Employees Union  to  protect  their\r\n\r\nmembers. However, when the open break came, what other\r\n\r\nbetter  means  to  discredit the Government  than  the\r\n\r\nclassic  Communist target of mounting  hatred  against\r\n\r\nthe  police and anything connected with the  machinery\r\n\r\nof  the  law  and  order which hampers  the  Communist\r\n\r\nobjective of creating violence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   disorder?  The  P.A.P. which  has  consistently\r\n\r\nadopted a pro-labour policy could not have been  anti-labour  overnight.  The police has  always  adopted  a\r\n\r\nneutral  and impartial attitude in strikes. I wish  to\r\n\r\nquote  a  statement issued by the Government  on  15th\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1960, showing the attitude of the Government\r\n\r\ntowards  strikes. A statement was issued  after  there\r\n\r\nwas  some indication that the police might be made use\r\n\r\nof  by  employers or employees in furtherance of their\r\n\r\ncause. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some unscrupulous employers are trying to get the\r\n\r\npolice involved in industrial disputes with a view  to\r\n\r\ncreating  illwill  between workers and  police.  In  a\r\n\r\nrecent case an employer invited a union official for a\r\n\r\ndiscussion at his office and then surreptitiously rang\r\n\r\nup  the  police  alleging intimidation  by  the  union\r\n\r\nofficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are duty bound when complaints are\r\n\r\nreceived to make investigations on the spot. But where\r\n\r\nthe  complaints are frivolous or malicious, the police\r\n\r\nare brought into contempt and ridicule and not the ill-intentioned complainant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the police is to protect and safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the people and maintain  peace  and\r\n\r\ngood order. The police give orders or take measures to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  interests of the people  and  so  such\r\n\r\norders must be obeyed. The authority of the State must\r\n\r\nbe  obeyed. The rights and wrongs of the decisions  of\r\n\r\nthe police are a matter to be argued subsequently in a\r\n\r\ncalmer  atmosphere before the proper authorities.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  the  Government  is  prepared  to  deal\r\n\r\nsternly with employers who through malice and mischief\r\n\r\nseek  to  turn  the  workers against  the  police  and\r\n\r\nthereby  to interfere with the Government's instrument\r\n\r\nof authority.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this clearly showed how pro-labour\r\n\r\nthe Government was. Far from the police being used  to\r\n\r\nbreak strikes, the Government even went out of its way\r\n\r\nto   dissuade  new  workers  from  being  engaged   by\r\n\r\nemployers during a `strike although the employers  had\r\n\r\na right to do so. In fact, the police always make it a\r\n\r\npoint  to consult labour officers and to get a  labour\r\n\r\nofficer  to explain to the strikers the laws governing\r\n\r\npicketing.  But  were  all these  pro-labour  measures\r\n\r\nappreciated  by the pro-Communists in the unions?  No.\r\n\r\nThe  pro-Communist elements in the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses   Employees'  Union  exploited  the  pro-labour\r\n\r\npolicy  of  Government  to their  own  advantage.  The\r\n\r\nimpartial  and  friendly attitude of  the  police  was\r\n\r\ninterpreted to be a sign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  weakness, to be exploited to the maximum advantage\r\n\r\nfor the Communist cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, much as I should like to cite\r\n\r\nexamples  of the tact and restraint exercised  by  the\r\n\r\npolice in cases of strikes recently, however, I cannot\r\n\r\ndo  so  as  most  of the cases are still  sub  judice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  the  cases cited by  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Labour yesterday  showed\r\n\r\nthat  in  every case the police had shown considerable\r\n\r\nrestraint and tact in the face of intense provocation,\r\n\r\nranging  from jeers and boos to obscene abuse  by  the\r\n\r\npro-Communist  officials. The police  intervened  only\r\n\r\nwhen  violence and disorder resulted or threatened  to\r\n\r\nresult and that only after repeated warnings had  been\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegations that the police had singled\r\n\r\nout  the English-speaking white-collar workers in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Business  Houses  Employees'   Union   for\r\n\r\nattention,  the answer is obvious. The  time  has  not\r\n\r\ncome  yet for the pro-Communists to mount a final  and\r\n\r\nconcerted  assault against merger and  Malaysia.  They\r\n\r\nare  still  hoping  against hope that  a  miracle  may\r\n\r\nhappen  to  delay  the  inevitable  reunification   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation. Besides, they think that\r\n\r\nthe   white-collar  English-speaking  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U. are not traditionally connected  with  pro-Communist  activities  and a  little  flexing  of  the\r\n\r\nmuscles in this field is not likely to receive as much\r\n\r\nattention as they would in the traditionally Communist\r\n\r\nhot  houses in the S.G.E.U. and its affiliates and the\r\n\r\nRural  Residents' Association and the Country People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations have also been made of police using\r\n\r\nforce  on  students,  and the  Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nspecially mentioned Chinese school students. Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  far  from using the  police  against  the\r\n\r\nstudents, the Government went out of its way to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  no  police were used in the last student boycott\r\n\r\nof  the Secondary IV Examination. This, however,  does\r\n\r\nnot  prevent the pro-Communists from repeating blatant\r\n\r\nlies against the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown revealed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclassic  tactic of the pro-Communists in  using  their\r\n\r\nagents and stooges in the trade unions to deceive  and\r\n\r\negg  on  the  innocent workers to  go  on  strike  for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes and to use illegal methods  in  the\r\n\r\nstrike, hoping thereby to provoke a clash between  the\r\n\r\npolice and the workers so that they could exploit  the\r\n\r\nsufferings  of  the workers to whip up hatred  against\r\n\r\nconstituted  authority.  The  Prime  Minister   warned\r\n\r\nagainst  the  mounting of industrial  unrest  by  pro-Communists  in August 1961 when the open  break  came,\r\n\r\nand we can look forward in the near future to more  of\r\n\r\nthese  violent political strikes mounted by  the  pro-Communists  on  the  back of the innocent  workers  in\r\n\r\ntheir  losing battle against the inevitable historical\r\n\r\nprocess  towards  reunification of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

He has said in the past - once  or\r\n\r\ntwice  as early as this year - that there is no  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment because there are militant trade unions.

I suggest that he read  some  of\r\n\r\nthe speeches his master, the Prime Minister, made when\r\n\r\nhe  was in the Opposition. I refer to Volume 2 - this is\r\n\r\nthe   speech  made  by  the  Prime  Minister  on   5th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1956 - column 78. It is in the middle of  the\r\n\r\npage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is a fallacy to suggest that because there have\r\n\r\nbeen  strikes, because unions are militant,  therefore\r\n\r\nwe have this lack of industrialisation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I repeat, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is a fallacy to suggest that because there have\r\n\r\nbeen  strikes, because unions are militant, therefore\r\n\r\nwe have this lack of industrialisation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am  quite certain that if the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwill take the trouble to read all the speeches made by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister when he was in the Opposition prior\r\n\r\nto May 1959, when he was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  adviser to about 47 trade unions in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nhe  will find a lot more quotations than this to  show\r\n\r\nthat  if there is a lack of industrialisation,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  because there are Communist agitators, it is  not\r\n\r\nbecause there are militant trade unionists and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot because there are militant trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure many of us can remember that only\r\n\r\nrecently in the Straits Times there was an extract  of\r\n\r\na  report  from  a  London newspaper  giving  us  some\r\n\r\nstatistics about the strikes in Western industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries  including  Japan. If  I  am  not  mistaken,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the extract, America  has  the  highest\r\n\r\nnumber  of  strikes.  Sir, I think  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  will  not be foolish enough to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere is a lack of industrialisation in America. I  am\r\n\r\nsure  he would become the worst enemy of the Americans\r\n\r\nif  he ever did venture to suggest that. Japan and the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom - countries  that  are  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nprogressive  in  the  field of  industrialisation - have\r\n\r\nmilitant  trade  unionists. In  Japan,  the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty is recognised and Communist Party officials  are\r\n\r\nin  key positions in trade unions, and yet there is no\r\n\r\nlack of industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once again we have in Singapore\r\n\r\npeople  in  responsible positions taking up the  stand\r\n\r\nthat  industrial  disputes  are  generated  by  a  few\r\n\r\ndisgruntled people. Of course, they term these  people\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Are they not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> For the information of the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  and others, I am quite prepared to say  quite\r\n\r\ncategorically that they are not Communists. Sir, today\r\n\r\nthe  term \"Communist\" is being used to refer to  every\r\n\r\nTom,  Dick and Harry who is not a stooge of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. thesis is that industrial  disputes  take\r\n\r\nplace  only because there are Communists. All  others,\r\n\r\nwith  the  exception of the P.A.P., go about  creating\r\n\r\nindustrial disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one should have thought that this rather\r\n\r\npigheaded  attitude  should have died  long  ago,  but\r\n\r\nevidently that is not the case. These people  seem  to\r\n\r\ncling to the childish notion that industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisputes are in themselves evil things and  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the activities of evil men. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsolution they put forward is to put a stop to militant\r\n\r\ntrade unionism; dig a big grave and bury all these so-called  Communists  and there will  be  no  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes. Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I  wish  to\r\n\r\nmake  it quite clear that trade disputes will continue\r\n\r\nto  arise  irrespective of what the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs, or the Minister for Internal Security of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya who, incidentally, I gather, will\r\n\r\nbe   commissioned  to  solve  industrial  disputes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore after the P.A.P. merger, may do in terms  of\r\n\r\neliminating   militant  trade   unionism   and   trade\r\n\r\nunionists. Sir, this is so because industrial disputes\r\n\r\nare  the results of the conflicts between workers  and\r\n\r\nemployers   in   the  process  of  production.   These\r\n\r\nconflicts arise because of the failure to reach mutual\r\n\r\nagreement  on  problems  relating  to  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment. In other words, an industrial  dispute  is\r\n\r\nthe   expression  of  the  economic  struggle  between\r\n\r\nworkers and capitalists. Sir, workers came into  being\r\n\r\nthe  very first day capitalist appeared and industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes   will  continue  so  long   as   there   are\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and workers, so long as employer/employee\r\n\r\nrelations  exist.  If  we are to have  a  constructive\r\n\r\ndebate, then let us not forget this truth just for the\r\n\r\npurposes of temporary expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be only too happy if any of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministers  can stand  up  honestly,  touch\r\n\r\ntheir  hearts and perhaps put the other  hand  on  the\r\n\r\nBible  and  give  an assurance that in  operating  the\r\n\r\nsystem of private enterprise there will be no strikes,\r\n\r\nassuming  that there will be no Communists. Give  them\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity of arresting everybody who they think\r\n\r\nis a Communist and putting them behind bars. Give them\r\n\r\na  situation  without the presence  of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nCommunists.  See  if  they  can  still  stand  up  and\r\n\r\nhonestly  give  an  assurance that there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nstrikes.  I say I will be much obliged and I  am  sure\r\n\r\nall  trade  unions  and trade unionists  and  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore will appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these trade unions that are termed pro-Communist - mind you, Sir, pro-Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade unions in Singapore mean every union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - other than the Singapore Bank Employees\r\n\r\nUnion,  the  Singapore Insurance  Companies  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion, the Singapore Traction Company Employees Union,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Printing Employees Union [Interruption].\r\n\r\nYou have only a few.

These unions  that  are\r\n\r\ntermed  pro-Communist are all in favour of  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.  Sir, we are in favour of employing  reasonable\r\n\r\nsteps.  We are in favour of doing everything  that  is\r\n\r\npossible  and is non-Communist to maintain  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with  justice. But we must know and understand,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, the concept of industrial  peace  with\r\n\r\njustice   as  is  propagated  by  the  Government   of\r\n\r\ntoday - the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no illusions as to what the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  means by industrial peace with justice.  We\r\n\r\nsaw  a demonstration of his form of justice during the\r\n\r\nyears  1955 to 1959, and his version of justice is  no\r\n\r\njustice  at all for the workers; and the rejection  of\r\n\r\nhis  anti-worker policies was very categorical in  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections in May 1959 and I do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nelaborate that here. The people have not forgotten the\r\n\r\ntype   of   law  and  order  the  previous  Government\r\n\r\nmaintained.  Sir, nearly three years of P.A.P. labour\r\n\r\npolicies  in  practice  has shown,  unfortunately  and\r\n\r\nregrettably,  very  little difference.  We  doubt  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of this Government. Therefore, we  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to give them a blank cheque and allow them  the\r\n\r\nright  to  take reasonable steps against the so-called\r\n\r\nCommunist agitators and the so-called Communist  trade\r\n\r\nunions.   Because,  First  of  all,  when   they   say\r\n\r\nreasonable steps,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  know  they do not mean reasonable steps. Secondly,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  say they are going to take action  against\r\n\r\nthe Communist, as I have said earlier, it means taking\r\n\r\naction  against  all unions other  than  five  or  six\r\n\r\nunions which happen to have P.A.P. personnel in  their\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the previous Government and the present\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government used the police on striking workers.\r\n\r\nIs  `hat what they term \"reasonable steps\"? The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  authorised police action in disputes  like\r\n\r\nSassoon's. That was early in 1960 when we were all  in\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.; all because they were unable to understand\r\n\r\nthe  aspirations of the workers. They used the  police\r\n\r\nin  disputes  like  the Singapore Glass  Factory,  the\r\n\r\nG.E.C.,   the   City   Council,  Robinson's,   Shaw's,\r\n\r\nGuthries,  etc. - just to mention a few. And  in  recent\r\n\r\ncases  they  have  used this Communist  excuse.  These\r\n\r\npolice  acts have all been defended by the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters  as reasonable, because they say  they  were\r\n\r\nused against professional Communist agitators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis do not consider\r\n\r\npolice   action   against   pickets   as   reasonable.\r\n\r\nUnwarranted  use  of  the  police  force  on  helpless\r\n\r\nworkers cannot be termed reasonable by any stretch  of\r\n\r\nthe imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Were they beaten up or something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The P.A.P.

The scene of police action\r\n\r\nduring  the City Council strike is still vivid in  our\r\n\r\nminds. We saw how the whole city was transformed  into\r\n\r\na  military  camp, all for the sake of fostering  upon\r\n\r\nthe   Government  daily-rated  workers  a  Government-sponsored  union. Unlike the previous Government,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was more vicious, and they used force  against\r\n\r\nthe   English-educated  clerks  and  salesgirls.

We have seen  how\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health and Law (the former  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Law) and the Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nspent some time saying how in the Robinson strike, the\r\n\r\nso-called  Communist  agitators  were  agitating   the\r\n\r\nworkers.  I  had  this advantage over  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters - when  they were perhaps safely  confined  to\r\n\r\nsome  cool  rooms and perhaps were just  reading  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  reports  of  what  was  happening   in\r\n\r\nRobinson's - that I was there. First of all,  there  was\r\n\r\nthis  charge that the so-called Communists  obstructed\r\n\r\nthe  entrance to the Robinson premises.  I  was  there\r\n\r\nfrom  about 10 o'clock. There were my colleagues.  Mr\r\n\r\nDominic Puthucheary was there from about 8 o'clock  in\r\n\r\nthe  morning.  It  is true that at 8 o'clock  all  the\r\n\r\nstrikers  went  and  sat on the steps:  the  Company's\r\n\r\ndoors  were  closed  and nobody could  go  in  without\r\n\r\nwalking  over  the  strikers.  But  when  Mr  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary went there, he told the strikers to  clear\r\n\r\nthe passage, and the passage was cleared. At 9 o'clock\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Company's officials came in, there  was  no\r\n\r\nobstruction.  They  all  walked  into  the   Company's\r\n\r\npremises. At 10 o'clock or so when the police arrived,\r\n\r\npeople  like Mr A. T. Rajah and other' senior  Police\r\n\r\nofficers all walked into the Company's premises.  When\r\n\r\nI  went  there,  all  these  people  were  inside  the\r\n\r\n.Company's  premises.  And  I  was  told   that   then\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the Company agreed that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nobstruction, and yet Mr A. T. Rajah -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> T. T. Rajah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> A. T. Rajah, the police officer who was in\r\n\r\ncharge  of operations there, said he had to clear  all\r\n\r\nthe   strikers,  irrespective  of  whether  they  were\r\n\r\nobstructing or not, irrespective of the fact that they\r\n\r\nwere  all  sitting aside with a wide open space  given\r\n\r\nfor  anyone to enter the premises. Sir, the  Company's\r\n\r\nofficials in my presence persuaded this police officer\r\n\r\nand  other police officers not to remove the strikers.\r\n\r\nThey  said,  \"As  far as we are  concerned,  we  have\r\n\r\naccess to our premises. We don't care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey can sit there. We want to carry on talks with the\r\n\r\nunion immediately so that we could solve the dispute.\"\r\n\r\nI  spoke to this police officer, Mr A. T. Rajah,  and\r\n\r\nhe  made  a telephone call, obviously to his political\r\n\r\nboss. When he came back, he said, \"Sorry, Mr Barn,  I\r\n\r\ncan't  do  anything.  I  have  orders  to  clear   the\r\n\r\nstrikers.\" Sir, under our Trade Disputes Ordinance,  a\r\n\r\nstriker  is arrested for obstruction if, in the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  he  forcibly prevents Company  officials  from\r\n\r\ngoing  into the premises. There was no such  incident.\r\n\r\nNo  company  official up to date has made  his  report\r\n\r\nsaying that he was stopped. If a worker prevents a non-striker from going into the premises, then it is  also\r\n\r\nclassified  as  obstruction. But  there  was  no  such\r\n\r\nincident.  There was nobody who wanted to go  to  work\r\n\r\nwho  was stopped. No one up to date has made a  report\r\n\r\nsaying  that he was forcibly stopped from  going  into\r\n\r\nthe premises. If a customer wanted to go in and if the\r\n\r\nstrikers  had  prevented him,  then  that  would  have\r\n\r\nconstituted  obstruction. There was no such  case.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Company's  officials had wanted to  remove  their\r\n\r\ngoods  from  the  premises, and if  the  strikers  had\r\n\r\nforcibly prevented them from removing them, then  that\r\n\r\ncould  have been obstruction. There was no such  case.\r\n\r\nSir,  there  was  no  case of  any  complaint  of  any\r\n\r\nobstruction,  and  yet the police arrested  everybody.\r\n\r\nThe  former Minister for Labour, i.e, the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law, who obviously was not there - I am  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether  he  was Minister  for  Labour  at  that\r\n\r\ntime - said yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the case of the Robinson strike, there was\r\n\r\ngenuine provocation by the employer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is true. The Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But Mr Dominic Puthucheary and company never\r\n\r\nintended  to take the dispute to the Labour  Ministry.\r\n\r\nMany   people  saw  Dominic  Puthucheary  urging   the\r\n\r\nstrikers to be arrested when the police were called on\r\n\r\nto  the scene. Charges of obstruction against a number\r\n\r\nof strikers were eventually withdrawn.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  he  said,  \"urging the strikers\".  This  is  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of today - \"urging the  strikers  to  be\r\n\r\narrested\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

I was in  his\r\n\r\noffice at about half-past eleven in the morning when I\r\n\r\ngot  a  telephone call from A.S.P. Rajah  saying  that\r\n\r\nthis  was  the  strike position -  that  the  men  were\r\n\r\ncrowding round the main entrance and he could not  get\r\n\r\nentry into the premises. He said he wanted a clearance\r\n\r\nfrom  me  as' to what his duties should be. I said  to\r\n\r\nhim   that  if  they  were  physically  blocking   the\r\n\r\nentrance,  then  it  would be his  duty  as  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer to clear a passage so that people could get in\r\n\r\nand out of the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not in my cool room. I had\r\n\r\nleft  my  office in my car and went round the premises\r\n\r\nof  Robinson  &  Co, that morning on  my  way  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance's office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is a pity the Minister could say it\r\n\r\nonly  now.

In the Robinson\r\n\r\nincident,  the  Prime Minister committed  contempt  by\r\n\r\ntalking  over Radio Singapore. In fact, a very  prompt\r\n\r\nstatement  was issued immediately after  the  Robinson\r\n\r\nincident, and to keep our mouths shut, all the workers\r\n\r\nwere  arrested, and 34 out of the 200 were charged  in\r\n\r\ncourt. So we could not comment on the Robinson strike.\r\n\r\nIf  there  had been no case pending, then there  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  a motion of censure on the Government  for\r\n\r\ntheir acts at the Robinson strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into this any more than is\r\n\r\nnecessary. All that I want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  say  is  this:  there was no case  of  obstruction\r\n\r\nbecause  there was no case and there was no report  of\r\n\r\nobstruction  made.  So  the police  arrested  everyone\r\n\r\npresent.  Sir,  this  was  supposed  to  have  been  a\r\n\r\nCommunist strike. And the police came with their Black\r\n\r\nMarias and Riot Squad with about 500 men from the Riot\r\n\r\nSquad  to handle about 200 workers, most of whom  were\r\n\r\nyoung  girls  and Christian girls. They  were  singing\r\n\r\n\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\", when the police arrived.\r\n\r\nSir,  when they were being arrested, we saw  that  the\r\n\r\npolice  were  using  force.  We  thought  it  was  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  because if the workers were to be  arrested\r\n\r\nfor  an offence which they had not committed, we  were\r\n\r\nquite  prepared  to tell the workers, \"Get  yourselves\r\n\r\narrested.  If  the police were to arrest  you  for  an\r\n\r\noffence  which  you have not committed,  then  do  not\r\n\r\nresist  arrest.\" And we knew very well that  if  there\r\n\r\nhad  been  resistance on the part of the  workers,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have been playing right into the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and given them the opportunity of  picking\r\n\r\nup  the  strikers.  Therefore, all  that  Mr  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary  told  the workers  was.  \"Do  not  resist\r\n\r\narrest.\"  First of all, they arrested 34 people;  took\r\n\r\nthem   to  the  Central  Police  Station,  took   down\r\n\r\nparticulars  and released them. The 34 came  back  and\r\n\r\nsquatted on the same place. The police then found that\r\n\r\nit  would  be embarrassing to arrest them in  batches,\r\n\r\ntake  them  to  the police station, and  then  release\r\n\r\nthem.,  because they would come back and squat on  the\r\n\r\nsame  place.  So they said, \"Pack up the  whole  lot.\"\r\n\r\nThey  arrested  over 200 workers and union  officials,\r\n\r\ntook them to the Central Police Station, and held them\r\n\r\nthere  until one o'clock, when we knew very well  that\r\n\r\nall   that  was  required  was  to  take  down   their\r\n\r\nparticulars and let them go. But they kept them  until\r\n\r\none o'clock. I remember the Commissioner of Police was\r\n\r\nin  the  Central Police Station and I did have a  chat\r\n\r\nwith  him.  I told him that, in my opinion - and  I  was\r\n\r\nadvised by counsel - that all that was required  was  to\r\n\r\ntake down their particulars and let them go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  said  it would take a whole day to take  down  the\r\n\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we knew that their purpose was to prevent the\r\n\r\nworkers   from  going  back  to  Robinson's.  Somehow,\r\n\r\nperhaps   because  of  the  threat  I  made   to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police that if the workers were  going\r\n\r\nto  be  detained longer than necessary, then we  would\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that we would take up the matter  further,\r\n\r\nthe  workers were released. And this time it took them\r\n\r\nless than one hour to take down the particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to make briefly is that when\r\n\r\nthese  workers  went  back to  Robinson's,  they  were\r\n\r\nprevented  from  picketing. We  were  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nCommunists, or supposed to be people who were creating\r\n\r\ntrouble.  The workers went hack. Why should Government\r\n\r\ndeny  them  the  right to picket?  Sir,  picketing  is\r\n\r\nguaranteed  to  the  workers under  the  laws  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,    laws   made   by   so-called    democratic\r\n\r\ngovernments.  These  are so-called  democratic  rights\r\n\r\ngiven to the workers. Yet these workers were prevented\r\n\r\nfrom picketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken some time over this because this is an\r\n\r\nexample  of the truth in all these so-called Communist\r\n\r\ndisputes that take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I suspend this sitting.

Sir, that was the\r\n\r\nRobinson strike, a strike called by a legitimate trade\r\n\r\nunion;  a strike which involved legitimate workers:  a\r\n\r\nstrike  which, in the words of the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand  Law,  had a legitimate cause; and yet,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  criticism of the strike  was  completely\r\n\r\nunsympathetic. All that they could think of saying was\r\n\r\nthat this was a strike called by Communist agitators\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto bring about disorder. Mr Speaker. Sir, we say that\r\n\r\nlaw and order on the industrial front brought about at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the legitimate claims of the workers is\r\n\r\ndeplorable. Industrial peace is not for the  exclusive\r\n\r\nprotection  of  vested interests.  Law  and  order  to\r\n\r\nadvance  the interests of the employers but to neglect\r\n\r\nthe  economic advance of the workers is unjust to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. Government, through its\r\n\r\nstooges,  is  concentrating all  its  efforts  on  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated section of the working class. This is\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has  completely lost the support  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial workers who were the backbone of the Party,\r\n\r\nwho were the mass base of the good old P.A.P. Now they\r\n\r\nare compelled to look for support in other directions.\r\n\r\nWhen  the P.A.P. came to power through the backing  of\r\n\r\nthe industrial workers, its leadership became arrogant\r\n\r\nand  began to insult and humiliate with vengeance  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  section of our population.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwent to such lengths that Mr Lim Ching Siong, who  is\r\n\r\ntoday  accused  of being the most important  Communist\r\n\r\ncadre,  had  to tell his colleague, Mr  Woodhull,  to\r\n\r\nwrite an open letter to the Prime Minister to cut  out\r\n\r\nall this anti-English-educated talk. Sir, it took some\r\n\r\ntime  for them to realise their mistake. But when they\r\n\r\nlost  the  support of the industrial  workers  through\r\n\r\ntheir  foolish  anti-labour  policies,  they  switched\r\n\r\ntheir line and began to woo the very same people  they\r\n\r\nhad  insulted and humiliated. The P.A.P. was naive  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the English-educated would support  them\r\n\r\nin  spite  of  the  past insults. Sir,  this  was  the\r\n\r\nmeasure  of respect the P.A.P. showed to this  section\r\n\r\nof  the  population. But to the dismay of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership,  they  found the English-speaking  workers\r\n\r\norganising   themselves  along   militant   lines   in\r\n\r\nindependent unions like the Singapore Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union. Then the Government started  a  two-prong attack on the English-educated workers, singling\r\n\r\nout  the Singapore Business Houses Employees Union  as\r\n\r\ntheir  main  target. They had to cook up a reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  attack.  They could not say that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness Houses Employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion was a good union and a powerful union that stood\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  the  interest of  the  English-educated\r\n\r\ncommercial workers. They could not say that this was a\r\n\r\nunion that did not want to be controlled by the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nand  therefore, they must attack it. They had to  cook\r\n\r\nup  a reason that would give an apparent justification\r\n\r\nfor  the  attack,  and  what better  reason  than  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  bogey?  So  the Singapore  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union today is supposed to be  a  Communist\r\n\r\nfront organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may state here that the Singapore Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees Union was formed in 1954. The  first\r\n\r\ntime   anybody  ever  accused  this  union  of   being\r\n\r\nCommunist  was  just about the time  of  the  Robinson\r\n\r\nstrike  last  year. Sir, those of us who  are  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and  who are  associated  with  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses Employees Union were associated  with\r\n\r\nthis  Union long before the break with the  P.A.P.  We\r\n\r\nwere associated with this Union as early as 1960.  Yet\r\n\r\nneither the Prime Minister nor anyone of the Ministers\r\n\r\never   said   that   this  was   a   Communist   front\r\n\r\norganisation. Even the Member for Cairnhill, a  former\r\n\r\nChief Minister, during 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958\r\n\r\nnever  ever  said  that  this was  a  Communist  front\r\n\r\norganisation. Today, the Government of the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ndirecting its attack on the Singapore Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees Union, by, on the one hand, persecuting the\r\n\r\nUnion  with the whole State machinery and by,  on  the\r\n\r\nother,  enticing  its membership  into  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nManual  and Mercantile Workers Union, a union that  is\r\n\r\nmanaged  by P.A.P. stooges and backed to the  hilt  by\r\n\r\nthe  State machinery, a union whose sole purpose seems\r\n\r\nto  be  to split the trade union movement and  thereby\r\n\r\nweaken the strength of the commercial workers. Sir, in\r\n\r\nstrikes  called  by  the  Singapore  Business   Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees Union, police actions have been very severe.\r\n\r\nThe  political wing of the Labour Ministry is  hostile\r\n\r\ntowards  this union. The Press and the radio are  used\r\n\r\nagainst  this union. Even the English Petir, organ  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. which recently made its reappearance after a\r\n\r\nlong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsence,  has devoted an editoral against this  union.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  interesting to examine why this  is  so.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Minister for Health and Law said, as  is\r\n\r\nreported in the Straits Times of today:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Twenty-five of the SATU strikes involved expatriate\r\n\r\nfirms,  while  only  six strikes called  by  the  non-aligned group involved such firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also revealed that the majority (24) of the SATU strikes were called by the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, either the Minister did not know the facts or he was deliberately making an inaccurate statement. I was\r\n\r\nsaying that the Business Houses Employees' Union was a\r\n\r\nunion  organised in 1954. The Minister says that  last\r\n\r\nyear  the  majority of the strikes were in  expatriate\r\n\r\nfirms,  24  of  the  25 were called by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses  Employees' Union.  Ever  since  this\r\n\r\nunion  was formed, it has called only 19 strikes.  The\r\n\r\nfirst strike took place in August 1959. Sir, I do  not\r\n\r\nsee the purpose of going to this extent of fabricating\r\n\r\nthe truth -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir,  you\r\n\r\nwill recall that one of that accusations was that this\r\n\r\nunion  was only asking for flat increases in  salaries\r\n\r\nand  was not asking for a salary structure. The reason\r\n\r\nthey  gave was that the Communists did not like salary\r\n\r\nstructures  because salary structures  stabilised  the\r\n\r\nposition. Let me briefly say what this union has  done\r\n\r\nand  what  it stands for, and also explain why  salary\r\n\r\nscales  are not embodied in all its claims.  First  of\r\n\r\nall, I must say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  during the past one year, this union has entered\r\n\r\ninto  something like 50 collective agreements with  50\r\n\r\nemployers, providing for salary increases ranging from\r\n\r\n$40  to  $120  per month over a period of  two  years.\r\n\r\nEverybody recognises that in the commercial field  the\r\n\r\nachievements of this union have been tremendous.

Sir, just to give a clearer picture,  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  since 1954, up to about the middle of last year,\r\n\r\ndefinitely up to the end of 1960, there was  not  even\r\n\r\none single agreement signed by this union. This was at\r\n\r\na  time  when  this union was not branded  as  a  pro-Communist  union, when the union was  run  perhaps  by\r\n\r\npeople  who never understood the employers  they  were\r\n\r\ndealing with. It was only after the union realised the\r\n\r\nneed   to  organise'  along  militant  lines  to  call\r\n\r\nstrikes, if necessary, that this achievement has  been\r\n\r\nbrought  about.  It  is ridiculous  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nleadership of this union, which is alleged to be  pro-Communist,  does not look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  More  than 5,000 workers have  benefited  by\r\n\r\nthe collective agreements that I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And salary scales, Sir? The Prime Minister was\r\n\r\nquite categorical when he said the Communists did  not\r\n\r\nlike  salary scales. Sir,I have never before heard  a\r\n\r\nsillier  statement than this. I know the situation  as\r\n\r\nit exists in the commercial world. I did say yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  the  people who were against salary scales  were\r\n\r\nthe   employers.  The  Prime  Minister's  logic   must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean that the employers  are  Communists,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure an employer who chooses to be  honest\r\n\r\nwill  bear  me  out  on  this.  I  have  had  personal\r\n\r\nexperience of being told by employers that they do not\r\n\r\nwant  salary scales. I do not want to go into details and  quote every single example. I will just quote one\r\n\r\nexample  to  start with. I am sure government  Members\r\n\r\ncan  check the truth of it. Nestle's (Malaya) Products\r\n\r\nLtd. The claims were negotiated for six months by  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses.  Employees' Union and  I  personally\r\n\r\nspent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  months negotiating with the employer on a  salary\r\n\r\nscale. At the end of the two months, he said \"No\".  He\r\n\r\nsaid  \"no\"  after agreeing in principle  to  a  salary\r\n\r\nstructure,  after  agreeing to a salary  structure  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  after  agreeing to the ladders  in  the  salary\r\n\r\nstructure and before final confirmation. The reason he\r\n\r\ngave  was that employers in the commercial world  felt\r\n\r\nthat a salary structure would take away the incentives\r\n\r\nthat  were  necessary for the workers. The  employers'\r\n\r\narguments are that if we have a salary structure  like\r\n\r\nthe  one in the bank where there is no bar, where  one\r\n\r\nstarts  from  the minimum and every year goes  up  the\r\n\r\nladder  right  up to the maximum without any  stoppage\r\n\r\nwhatsoever,  then  incentives do  not  exist  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  commercial firms have the  practice  of\r\n\r\ngiving  increments on the basis of merit.  Sir,  as  a\r\n\r\nunionist  we disagree with this. We disagree with  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  We  feel there must be a salary  structure,\r\n\r\nbut  we realise, as practical people, that if we press\r\n\r\non  with  the call for a salary structure, we will  be\r\n\r\nhaving a lot more strikes than we have at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time when employers whose workers\r\n\r\nwere  members of the Business Houses Employees'  Union\r\n\r\nrefused to negotiate on wage increases. They said wage\r\n\r\nincreases  were at their discretion.  It  took  a  few\r\n\r\nstrikes  to  drum  sense  into  the  heads  of   these\r\n\r\nemployers,  and I am sure, I have no doubt whatsoever,\r\n\r\nthat if we want to force the business houses employers\r\n\r\nto  accept a salary structure, we will have to call  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  strikes in the first place. What  are  the\r\n\r\nGovernment trying to do? Do they want us to call  more\r\n\r\nstrikes  so that they can come here and say  Communist\r\n\r\nagitators are calling strikes? Sir, to the best of  my\r\n\r\nknowledge,  there is no trade union in Singapore  that\r\n\r\nhas anything against a salary structure. If what I say\r\n\r\nis  doubted, I ask Government Members, as I asked them\r\n\r\nyesterday, to get in touch with the employers. Mr  J.\r\n\r\nJ.  Rattray,  Industrial  Adviser  to  the  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation,  has  had  several  discussions  with   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  me, and I am quite sure  if  the  man\r\n\r\nchooses to tell the truth, he will confirm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  I say. Sir, this is just another example of  the\r\n\r\nextent to which the Government are prepared to go just\r\n\r\nto make their Communist smear stick. In their haste to\r\n\r\ndo  this,  they  do not consider the validity  of  the\r\n\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also touched on the Ford strike that has just ended. He again said this was a strike which was called by the Communists, not for the benefit of the Ford workers, but simply because the Communists wanted to agitate the trouble. He also said how the results did not favour the workers. He said yesterday that they only got six cents per day. This again is a P.A.P. bluff. It is an inaccurate\r\n\r\nstatement.  Surely,  responsible men  like  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  should  assess the facts first,  unless,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  thinks all the people  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nfools and he can bluff them and get away with it. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  signed by the union for  Ford  workers\r\n\r\nprovides for a rise of six cents per hour as from  the\r\n\r\n1st  of March, 1962. As from the 1st of January, 1963,\r\n\r\nanother  five  cents per hour. It works out  for  this\r\n\r\nyear  at 52.8 cents per day, and for 1963, 96.8  cents\r\n\r\nper day additional increase on the workers' pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, the average has been 88 cents per\r\n\r\nhour.  In  1962, the wages would be pushed  up  to  94\r\n\r\ncents per hour, and in 1963 they would be pushed up to\r\n\r\n99 cents per hour. Also, as a result of the agreement,\r\n\r\nthe  workers are expected to work only 42\u00bd  hours  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  paid for 49 hours and they work a  five-day\r\n\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister said that that was a\r\n\r\nCommunist  strike.  I believe he also  said  that  the\r\n\r\nCommunist do not normally refer these disputes to  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ministry for conciliation. I wonder if  he  is\r\n\r\naware  that the Ford negotiations were carried out  in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ministry soon after the strike. Sir, I  am\r\n\r\ngoing into some detail on this again because I want to\r\n\r\nexpose this Communist bluff that is being put forward.\r\n\r\nOnce  and  for  all,  let us see to  what  extent  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will go in attempting to make  this  smear\r\n\r\nstick. Everybody knows - once the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Finance told me - that Ford is internationally known\r\n\r\nto  be  a bad employer. I am sure we have all read  of\r\n\r\nthe Ford strikes in Canada and the United Kingdom. The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance himself told us that Ford  is  a\r\n\r\nbad  employer.  There  have been three  strikes  since\r\n\r\n1957.   In  1957,  there  were  dismissals  and  union\r\n\r\nofficials were victimised - there was a strike, in 1960,\r\n\r\nthere  was a strike because of retrenchments. In 1961,\r\n\r\nthe  last  strike  took place because  the  management\r\n\r\nwanted  to negotiate on salary increases only  subject\r\n\r\nto  the employees agreeing to produce 14 cars per day.\r\n\r\nThis  was  nonsense.  No union worth  its  salt  would\r\n\r\naccept  such a situation in the context of an industry\r\n\r\nlike Ford where hitherto the pay has been on the basis\r\n\r\nof a time rate. The union was quite right - as I am sure\r\n\r\nMembers  on the other side of the House will accept - if\r\n\r\nthe employer wants to relate any further increases  in\r\n\r\nthe  salary to production. That was the primary  cause\r\n\r\nof  the  strike.  The Prime Minister  made  it  appear\r\n\r\nyesterday  that the Ford workers were all dissatisfied\r\n\r\nand  that  they  were on strike for  three  months - 110\r\n\r\ndays - all  for  the sake of helping the  Communists  to\r\n\r\nmake propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have told the Government Members before - and I\r\n\r\nsay  this  again - in the first place, if they  want  to\r\n\r\nknow how the Ford workers feel about the strike, I say\r\n\r\nthey   feel  \"jollified\"  because  they  have  got   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   increase  in  their   salaries   and   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial improvement in their conditions  of  work.\r\n\r\nThis could not have been brought about if not for  the\r\n\r\nstrike.  If  they  do not believe this,  they  are  at\r\n\r\nliberty - they have the whole State machinery - and they\r\n\r\nare  in  a  position  to go and interview  every  Ford\r\n\r\nworker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not have to go through the process of\r\n\r\ncalling a strike and having to combat with the  police\r\n\r\nforce  to  discredit the Government. I have said  this\r\n\r\nbefore.  We  are  satisfied that  the  Government  are\r\n\r\nsufficiently discredited. We do not have to go through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  motion.  The  truth  of  the  statement  can  be\r\n\r\nchecked - hold general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you not resign?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is as simple as that. Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to throw challenges, but what I am saying  quite\r\n\r\nsimply  is  this.  We do not have to  go  through  the\r\n\r\nprocess of strikes to prove that the Government  is  a\r\n\r\nbad Government because this has been proved abundantly\r\n\r\nclear.  If  the Government doubt that statement,  they\r\n\r\nare always welcome to check the truth or otherwise  of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government now is creating the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey. This is like the old P.A.P. gramophone record - a\r\n\r\nrecord  that has a tiny little hole in the groove  and\r\n\r\nit   goes  on  the  same  groove  repeating  the  same\r\n\r\ntune - Communist,   Communist,   Communist... Sir,    they\r\n\r\nattempt to attribute all industrial actions to  a  few\r\n\r\nindividuals   who  are  termed  Communists   or   pro-Communists.  The P.A.P. desperadoes are  deliberately\r\n\r\nmisleading the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today strikes are being called not just by unions\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government chooses to describe as Communist\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, but I am sure we are all aware of  some\r\n\r\nof  the  recent strikes. I wish I can list down  every\r\n\r\nsingle  strike  that took place and show  which  union\r\n\r\ncalled  a strike and explain the cause of the  strike,\r\n\r\nbut  I cannot do this because I may have to go on till\r\n\r\nmidnight. I am quite sure that you, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  not allow me to do that. Therefore, I will  just\r\n\r\ntry  and  quote a few examples. Let us take  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil   strike  called  by  the  Public  Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees  Unions Federation. Their basic  grouse  was\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government's  intention  to  foster  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. against the wishes of the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  daily-rated workers. This was sufficiently\r\n\r\nproved by a secret ballot held by the Government after\r\n\r\nthe  strike  was  over where the A.U.P.E. suffered  a\r\n\r\nhumiliating  defeat. No amount of  cry  Communism  can\r\n\r\ndeceive  our  workers as to the  real  cause  of  this\r\n\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis had nothing\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to do with the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You had a conversation with\r\n\r\nRajendra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I used to tell the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nthat  as  far as we are concerned we have the guts  to\r\n\r\nsay  that this is a strike called by us and defend the\r\n\r\nstrike  on  the merits of it. We do not want  to  take\r\n\r\ncredit for which we are not due. All that happened was\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Rajendra, who has been for quite some  time\r\n\r\nassociated with the City Council Federation of  Labour\r\n\r\nUnions  and  the  Public Daily-Rated Employees  Unions\r\n\r\nFederation, was at the premises of this union in  Race\r\n\r\nCourse Road. [Interruption]. There is nothing to laugh\r\n\r\nabout  this. The Minister for Education knows next  to\r\n\r\nnothing  of what is going on on the industrial  front.\r\n\r\nMr  Rajendra  is  the Secretary  of  the  Staff  Side\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Sir,  I  am  not holding  a  brief  for  Mr\r\n\r\nRajendra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not here to defend him. But let us\r\n\r\nexamine the facts. I do not want to be as foolish  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture to throw accusations. It  is\r\n\r\nsimple.  All you have to do is to say, \"Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong is a Communist. He is associated with so and  so\r\n\r\nwho  is  in  S.A.T.U. That person is a  Communist  and\r\n\r\ntherefore S.A.T.U. is Communist. Therefore, all  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  associate themselves with  S.A.T.U. must\r\n\r\nnecessarily be Communists.\" Sir, a five-year old child\r\n\r\ncan  repeat  this. It does not take  brains  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Bench to cook up a story like this. But let\r\n\r\nus see the facts. The day Mr Rajendra was in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil Unions Federation premises there was a meeting\r\n\r\nof  Government unions scheduled, and he was  there  to\r\n\r\nget  information about the strike and to report to his\r\n\r\nunions  in  the  Government service - a very  legitimate\r\n\r\nact.  Sir,  here  was  a dispute involving  Government\r\n\r\nworkers, and if the Government unions wanted to have a\r\n\r\nmeeting  to discuss the City Council strike I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee anything\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong in that. Anyway, this is what I was told by  Mr\r\n\r\nRajendra   after   the   Prime  Minister   made   this\r\n\r\naccusation.  While  Mr  Rajendra  was  there  in  the\r\n\r\npremises,  the  officials of  the  Public  Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union asked him whether he  knew  to  which\r\n\r\nunion certain workers who were manning the lorries and\r\n\r\nwho   were  breaking  the  strike  belonged  to.   Mr\r\n\r\nRajendra,  who did not know very much of the situation\r\n\r\nin  the  non-Government sector, phoned  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees  Union  in  Middle  Road,  got  Mr\r\n\r\nDominic  Puthucheary and asked him, \"Do  you  know  to\r\n\r\nwhich  unions  these workers belong to?\"  Mr  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary said, \"They belong to the Singapore Manual\r\n\r\nand  Mercantile  Employees Union, a  union  led  by  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  man, a union that is used quite  naturally\r\n\r\nto  break  a  strike which is against the interest  of\r\n\r\nanother  Government union, the A.U.P.E.\" That was  all\r\n\r\nthat  happened. A mountain was made out of a molehill.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  telephones were tapped. The Special  Branch\r\n\r\ntakes  the liberty of tapping the telephones of  trade\r\n\r\nunions. Even the telephones of the Presidents of  some\r\n\r\ntrade unions are tapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, and Assemblymen too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And Assemblymen, Sir. I wonder whether we\r\n\r\ncan  talk  about it at a later date. That  is  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  happened. And because the telephones were tapped\r\n\r\nand  because  the  Government received  their  reports\r\n\r\nsaying  that  on such and such a day Mr Rajendra  was\r\n\r\nseen  in the premises and that at such and such a time\r\n\r\nhe  phoned Mr Dominic Puthucheary, a big story  of  a\r\n\r\nCommunist plot was cooked up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell the Government to at least try and be\r\n\r\nhonest.  They can disagree with us. They can say  that\r\n\r\nthey  disagree with our policies, that  they  want  to\r\n\r\nfight  us  in  our policies. We are quite prepared  to\r\n\r\nface them and fight them anywhere they choose. But let\r\n\r\nus  conduct  this fight at least with the  decency  of\r\n\r\nbeing  honest. They know very well, Sir, that none  of\r\n\r\nus  has anything to do with this strike. But they want\r\n\r\nto make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit big. They knew that this was a big strike, and they\r\n\r\nwanted to cover up their mistakes. They knew they were\r\n\r\ncaught because of their attempt to foster a Government\r\n\r\nsponsored union - a strike of 10,000 workers took  place\r\n\r\naffecting  the  essential services of the  country - and\r\n\r\nthey built up this smear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a little later I shall deal with the figures\r\n\r\nthat were juggled yesterday by the Prime Minister, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour - sorry, the Minister for Health and\r\n\r\nLaw.  I  only know the Minister for Health and Law  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour, and every time I look at him\r\n\r\nI still think that he is the Minister for Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He knows a great deal about you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, it is very disturbing for me,\r\n\r\nespecially  to notice that the Minister  for  Labour's\r\n\r\nseat is always vacant.

Sir, before I deal with\r\n\r\nthe  figures that were juggled yesterday, I just  want\r\n\r\nto  go  through  a  list of a few of the  unions  that\r\n\r\ncalled  for  strikes. We remember  that  the  A.U.P.E.\r\n\r\nsometime  back  served  a  strike  ultimatum  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Although there was no strike, nevertheless\r\n\r\nthe A.U.P.E. served a strike ultimatum. I believe they\r\n\r\nserved  it  twice: once in connection with some  issue\r\n\r\naffecting  the  firemen,  and  the  other  one   quite\r\n\r\nrecently. We all know that the Secretary-General\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the A.U.P.E. is the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, an eternal P.A.P. henchman. Sir,\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Government propose to say that this  strike\r\n\r\nthreat was also the machinations of the Communists? Or\r\n\r\ndoes the Government propose to say that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ncreating industrial unrest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure we are also aware that a few months ago\r\n\r\nthe  workers  of the Bank of America went  on  strike.\r\n\r\nFollowing  that, the employees of the  Chartered  Bank\r\n\r\nwent  on  strike. Then the employees of  the  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation went on strike. All  these\r\n\r\nworkers  are members of the Singapore Bank  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  Mr Devan Nair and the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for Culture are  advisers  to  this\r\n\r\nUnion.  Does  the Government propose to say  that  all\r\n\r\nthese  strikes  were caused by Communist machinations?\r\n\r\nSome  insurance  company  workers  recently  went   on\r\n\r\nstrike.  They  are members of the Singapore  Insurance\r\n\r\nCompanies Employees Union. This Union again is led  by\r\n\r\nP.A.P. men.  The  Singapore  Manual  and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers  Union  have  merrily  been  calling  numerous\r\n\r\nstrikes  in  recent  months with Government  blessing.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that T. V. Gomez, Secretary General of\r\n\r\nthis  Union, is an obedient P.A.P. stooge.  Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair is the adviser to this Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone of us knows that strikes have been\r\n\r\ncalled;  strikes are being called today, not  just  by\r\n\r\nunions  that  are termed pro-Communist and  Communist.\r\n\r\nBut  the  speeches of the Ministers - and now with  this\r\n\r\namendment moved - give one the impression that  all  the\r\n\r\nstrikes in Singapore are due to the Communists.  There\r\n\r\nis   this  talk  of  mounting  of  industrial  unrest.\r\n\r\nYesterday   we   had  figures  being  used   to   show\r\n\r\njustification  for  their  allegation  that  there  is\r\n\r\nmounting  of  industrial unrest. Sir,I  do  not  deny\r\n\r\nthere   is  industrial  unrest;  there  is  industrial\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction. I shall go into the reasons why  this\r\n\r\nis  so  in a short while. But let us just examine  the\r\n\r\nfigures that have been played with, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Monthly Digest of Statistics - Vol. 1,\r\n\r\nNo.  1, January 1962 - and I am sure the Government will\r\n\r\nnot doubt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese figures. Unlike the Minister, I do not have  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of  getting a whole list  of  up  to  date\r\n\r\nstrikes.  But  let  us  just  briefly  examine   these\r\n\r\nfigures.  First of all, let us take the man-days  lost\r\n\r\nfor   one-whole  year  1961.  According  to  page  26,\r\n\r\nindustrial   stoppages   by   major   industries: 1961,\r\n\r\n410,891, as compared with 152,006 for 1960. Sir, so  a\r\n\r\nbig  show  was  made yesterday. 1960,  150,000;  1961,\r\n\r\n410,000 - mounting of industrial unrest. You will  note,\r\n\r\nSir,  that out of these 410,891 man-days lost for that\r\n\r\nyear,  274,849 man-days were as a result of the strike\r\n\r\naffecting electricity, gas and water. In other  words,\r\n\r\nthis relates to the strike called by the Public Daily-Rated  Employees Unions Federation. I am sure some  of\r\n\r\nus  can  remember that towards the end  of  last  year\r\n\r\nthere  was  a one-day strike called by the Army  Civil\r\n\r\nService  Union which is a union with which we have  no\r\n\r\nconnections  whatsoever, a union which  has  not  been\r\n\r\nnamed by the Government Ministers as a Communist-front\r\n\r\nunion.  For all I know, maybe after this they may  say\r\n\r\nthat  this  union also is a Communist front union.  So\r\n\r\nfar  they have said nothing. As a result of this  one-day strike, Sir, there was a loss of about 17,000 man-days.  This  was in the month of November  1961.  This\r\n\r\nunion membership is about 17,000. So roughly speaking,\r\n\r\nSir, 17,000 man-days were lost as a result of the Army\r\n\r\nCivil Service Union strike, plus 274,849 man-days lost\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the City Council strike.  That  makes\r\n\r\n291,849  man-days lost for last year - no, I  am  sorry,\r\n\r\nSir;  if  I  may go over it step by step  to  make  it\r\n\r\nclearer. [Interruption] I am quite certain, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nI  am  better  than the Prime Minister in numbers.  In\r\n\r\nfact, when he was juggling with the figures yesterday,\r\n\r\nI  thought I should tell him that I would at any  time\r\n\r\nlike  to have him in my class if I ever should go back\r\n\r\nto  teaching, and pull him by the ear and tell him  to\r\n\r\ndo his figures properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just go through it stage by stage. 274,849\r\n\r\nman-days  were lost as a result of the strike  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Daily-Rated  Employees. 17,000  man-days  were\r\n\r\nlost in the Army strike. That gives a total of 291,849\r\n\r\nman-days.  You  deduct  291  from  291,849,  and  that\r\n\r\nresulting figure from 410,089, and we get something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  119,000. Sir, 119,000 compares favourably\r\n\r\nwith 152,000 in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just one more comparison. The Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  naming  the Singapore Business Houses  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion and the Singapore General Employees Union as the\r\n\r\ntwo   important  Communist  front  organisations.  The\r\n\r\nmembers  of  these  unions  are  mostly  employed   in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries and commercial houses. If  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the Government statistics for 1961, we  find\r\n\r\nthat  in  the manufacturing industry there  were  only\r\n\r\n71,580 man-days lost as against 129,894 man-days  lost\r\n\r\nin  1960 - a  definite reduction. Let us take  commerce.\r\n\r\nCommerce  includes  not  just  the  S.G.E.U. and  the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U. but  also unions like the  Singapore  Bank\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union and the Singapore Insurance Companies\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union.  The statistics  for  commerce  show\r\n\r\n19,840.  Even if we add the man-days lost for commerce\r\n\r\nand  manufacturing, it is yet lower than the  man-days\r\n\r\nlost in the manufacturing industry in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was also one comparison given by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  yesterday in  respect  of  August  to\r\n\r\nDecember  or so, last year. I have calculated,  in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as man-days are concerned - that nearly 80 per cent\r\n\r\nor so of the man-days lost during this period were due\r\n\r\nto  the City Council strike and the Army Civil Service\r\n\r\nUnion strike. Therefore, to suggest that the so-called\r\n\r\nCommunists  and pro-Communists are mounting industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  is, to say the least, malicious. The nakedness\r\n\r\nof  this  untruth  is quite easily exposed.  In  their\r\n\r\neagerness  to  brand  their  political  opponents   as\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  thereby prepare for  repression,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders are making inaccurate statements.

Sir, if there is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number  of  strikes,  it  is  clear\r\n\r\nevidence that there is increasing discontent among the\r\n\r\nworkers,  be  they  members of the  unions  which  are\r\n\r\nP.A.P. led or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Increasing discontent after\r\n\r\nAnson!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As far as we are concerned, we stand with\r\n\r\nall  workers  irrespective of which trade  union  they\r\n\r\nbelong  to.

My\r\n\r\ndisagreement  with him on the sort  of  labour  policy\r\n\r\nthat the Government has pursued after the election  is\r\n\r\nwell  known  to  many  people  in  the  P.A.P.  I  had\r\n\r\ncriticised the Government's labour policy long  before\r\n\r\nthe Anson by-election or the Hong Lim by-election. And\r\n\r\nthey  know it well. I am sure the Prime Minister  will\r\n\r\nvery  vividly recall one incident affecting  the  Hume\r\n\r\nIndustries  workers. The Singapore  General  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  submitted  a  wage  claim  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial   workers.  Mr  Dominic  Puthucheary,   my\r\n\r\nfriend, was negotiating. The employer said, \"I  cannot\r\n\r\ngive  even  a five-cent rise. If I have to  give  five\r\n\r\ncents, I have to close down the company.\" This was  in\r\n\r\n1960, long before Anson and long before Hong Lim.  The\r\n\r\nunion  knew the financial position of the company.  So\r\n\r\nthey just pressed on with their claim. There was a go-slow.  The  employer  went to a sympathetic  man,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, and produced I do not know  what\r\n\r\nfigures  and  papers.  But somehow  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance believed the employer's story and went to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  And  the Prime Minister  called  Mr\r\n\r\nDominic  Puthucheary to his office. \"Dom, you withdraw\r\n\r\nthe claim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Was the Member present?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of explanation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Was the Member present?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I was not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You were not present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was not present, but I am sure the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  can take me to task if I am making  a  wrong\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Prime Minister knows full well that\r\n\r\nsubsequently  we had discussions on this together.

Sir, I remember very clearly the day  when  we\r\n\r\ndiscussed  with the Prime Minister. And we criticised\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's action very severely. To cut the\r\n\r\nwhole  story short. At the end of it all, the  workers\r\n\r\nhad  a  wage increase ranging from 70 cents to  $1.50.\r\n\r\nAnd  Hume Industries has not closed down. It is  still\r\n\r\nprospering,  and  only recently, sometime  last  month\r\n\r\nactually,  a  new agreement was signed giving  a  wage\r\n\r\nincrease for the clerical workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have the ridiculous talk about the\r\n\r\nmounting  industrial unrest and the need to  curb  it.\r\n\r\nBut  no effort is made to examine the causes of  these\r\n\r\ndisputes  and the circumstances in which  they  arise.\r\n\r\nInstead,  we  have people in responsible positions  in\r\n\r\nGovernment falling into the same temptation  of  their\r\n\r\ncolonial  and pro-colonial predecessors, and regarding\r\n\r\nthese disputes with hostility. Let me state simply and\r\n\r\nclearly  that  disputes  flare  up  for  a  number  of\r\n\r\nreasons,  the  foremost  of  which  is  the  sense  of\r\n\r\noppression and injustice felt by our working people in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Anyone who pretends to champion the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncause of all these strikers must, first of all, get it\r\n\r\ninto his head that there are definite grievances among\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and that strikes take place not  because\r\n\r\nworkers are unreasonable. It is no use for any  Member\r\n\r\nof  this House to come here and cry \"Communism\". It is\r\n\r\nuseless  to  suggest  that there are  strikes  because\r\n\r\nthere are professional agitators at work. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  crying  \"Communism\" is not going  to  solve  any\r\n\r\nproblem, though it may be used by the Government as an\r\n\r\nexcuse  to  carry out repression. Sir, the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot   remove  the  sense  of  grievance  by  crying\r\n\r\n\"Communism\". The people of Singapore have  heard  this\r\n\r\ncry of wolf once too often. It is a futile exercise to\r\n\r\ntry  the childish gimmick of crying \"Communism\".  Sir,\r\n\r\nthose  who  profess concern for the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of strikes must be objective in their analysis.\r\n\r\nSir,  strikes do not take place out of the  blue.  The\r\n\r\nstrike  is  the ultimate weapon in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  And  the  workers do not use  this  to  play\r\n\r\nmarbles with. Strikes demand sacrifices on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. If there are workers prepared to sit  it\r\n\r\nout,  to  go  on strike indefinitely, then there  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily be very legitimate grievances.  I  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the people in power would understand this rather\r\n\r\nsimple  fact. Sir, when we were in the P.A.P., in  the\r\n\r\ndays  when  it  was fighting the previous  Government,\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be some appreciation of this fact. But\r\n\r\nonce the P.A.P. leaders came to power, they seemed  to\r\n\r\noverlook this fact very easily. The taste of power  is\r\n\r\na  terrible thing. It makes one forget one's own past,\r\n\r\nforget  even  the hopes and aspirations  of  the  very\r\n\r\npeople who brought the Government to power. I need not\r\n\r\nrepeat  the old dictum about the corrupting  influence\r\n\r\nof  power. It is such a stark truth and we have it  in\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is making every attempt to\r\n\r\nattribute industrial disputes to the machinations of a\r\n\r\nfew    individuals,   and   these   individuals    are\r\n\r\nconveniently labelled Communists. Sir, the  Government\r\n\r\nis merely playing politics. It is trying to coerce the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement and, in so doing, it is plugging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe same line, resorting to the same measures  in espousing \r\n\r\nthe  same  philosophy  of   the   previous Government. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government's hostility to the unions is evident.\r\n\r\nIts attempt to connect industrial disputes with its own bid for survival\r\n\r\nis equally evident.  The old  colonial cry of Communist wolf is being \r\n\r\nmade time and  again. Sir, industrial disputes that emerge as  a result\r\n\r\nof dissatisfaction among the working people are now   being  viewed \r\n\r\nwith  a  blatant  hostility.  Mr Speaker,  Sir, let me tell these rather \r\n\r\nwild  men  in power  that they cannot remove the sense of  grievance\r\n\r\nunless they remove the causes of the grievance. Let me tell  these \r\n\r\nmen that they cannot use the trade  union movement as the scapegoat for\r\n\r\ntheir various repressive actions. Let me also warn them that they will\r\n\r\nonly  be increasing  the  sense  of dissatisfaction  among  the working \r\n\r\npeople  if  they  seek  to  throttle   their expression of grievances.\r\n\r\nSir, they cannot destroy the trade  union  movement by putting  a \r\n\r\nfew  individuals behind  bars.  Sir, if it has not been made  plain \r\n\r\nto them before, then let it be made plain now. Industrial dissatisfaction \r\n\r\nthere certainly is. It is not  because of the machinations of a few\r\n\r\nindividuals. It is unless to  sit  in this House and pray for industrial\r\n\r\npeace. Industrial peace will not drop from heaven like manna. To \r\n\r\nachieve industrial peace and stability  calls  for the  co-operation \r\n\r\nof workers and employers alike.  The prerequisite for this,\r\n\r\nhowever, is political stability provided by a strong and stable government \r\n\r\nwhich  will be  unbiased in industrial relations. Sir, to  imagine that  \r\n\r\nby  curtailing  the freedom  of  expression  and activity  of \r\n\r\ntrade unions, one would achieve  anything would  only  be  folly \r\n\r\namounting to lunacy.  Sir,  one cannot cure anything by treating\r\n\r\nthe symptoms.  It  is the  disease  that needs treatment. \r\n\r\nThe  first  step, therefore, is to make the right diagnosis. \r\n\r\nToday  the Government   simply   attempts   to   attribute   \r\n\r\nthe manifestations  of industrial dissatisfaction  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunist bogey.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine and see what has gone wrong, so that we understand in\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproper  perspective  the  present  situation  on   the industrial front.\r\n\r\nIt was primarily on the strength  of the  trade union movement that \r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. was  brought into office. With the advent of the P.A.P. \r\n\r\nGovernment, there  was  political stability. Employers  ceased  to play  \r\n\r\npolitics;   workers  and  their   unions   made determined  efforts to\r\n\r\nnegotiate peaceful  settlements and  used the conciliation machinery \r\n\r\nof the Government with  confidence.  There was, in  fact, \r\n\r\nunprecedented peace  on  the industrial front. There was \r\n\r\nindustrial peace. But this was short-lived. The beginning of 1960 showed\r\n\r\na  change  in the situation. The  power  crazy Prime  Minister,  who had,\r\n\r\nprior to the  1959  general elections,  identified himself with  the \r\n\r\ntrade  union movement,  with  the emotions and  sentiments  of  the workers, \r\n\r\nand  who  finally  achieved  power,   became crazier  and  crazier with \r\n\r\npower. He  wanted  to  curb everybody's influence. He wanted to make sure \r\n\r\nthat  he was  in  a  position  of power  for  life.  He  wanted everyone\r\n\r\nelse  to  be responsible for  his  unpopular measures.  In short, he wanted\r\n\r\nothers to do the  dirty job  for  him. He saw in the trade union movement \r\n\r\nthe solidarity of the workers. It was a solidarity that he did not \r\n\r\napprove of, because he feared the strength  of the working class movement,\r\n\r\nfor he knew full well that this  was  a constant threat to his personal \r\n\r\nambitions which  were  contrary to the interest of  the  working people.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] Therefore, he set about  trying to  undermine  it. \r\n\r\nSir,  I  can  jeer  \"Running  dogs barking.\"  I  do  not  want to  take  more  time  than necessary - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The S.P.A., as far as he was concerned, \r\n\r\nwas finished. The British, to  his mind, would remain in the background\r\n\r\nand would not  do  a  thing except if the Left-wing got  out  of hand.\r\n\r\nIf the trade unionists made too much noise,  the British,  according \r\n\r\nto him would  not  sit  back  and watch.  So  he  saw  himself in  a \r\n\r\nrather  favourable position.  There was nothing to worry about  from  \r\n\r\nthe Right.  As  far  as the workers and the working  class movement \r\n\r\nwere concerned, they could not go  very  far for fear of British \r\n\r\nreprisals. To his mind, he was  an indispensable figure. The Right \r\n\r\nhad to accept him. The Left  had  to  work with him. He thought he \r\n\r\ncould  do anything  and get away with it. He saw the opportunity to\r\n\r\ncurb the power of the trade unions, and to curb the influence  of  \r\n\r\nthe  workers in the affairs  of  State. Aside from reintroducing \r\n\r\nthe P.P.S.O. and carrying out other severe measures, he compelled \r\n\r\ntrade unionists to identify themselves with all his acts, hoping \r\n\r\nthereby that they would incur the wrath and the displeasure of the\r\n\r\nworking people of Singapore. Privately, he talked tough  with us,\r\n\r\nbut publicly he allowed the impression of  unity.  He  went  further\r\n\r\nand openly  ignored  the election  pledges.  Union  leaders  working  \r\n\r\nwith  the Government  were not even consulted over  legislation. We\r\n\r\nourselves pressed for consultation in the hope and belief  that  \r\n\r\nwe must make the Government  a  success. Instead,   our   desire  \r\n\r\nand  sincerity   were   being unashamedly abused by the Government.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Industrial Relations Ordinance was first\r\n\r\nintroduced, there was some consternation  among trade  unionists.\r\n\r\nThe whole purpose of this  Ordinance in its original form was designed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto silence the workers and their trade unions. There  was  \r\n\r\nhardly any prior consultation  with  trade unions  and trade \r\n\r\nunionists who were working with  the Government. We had to force \r\n\r\nthe Government  to  listen to  our  representations. Again I am  \r\n\r\nsure  the  Prime Minister will recall that I was quite prepared to\r\n\r\ncome to  this House, sit on the Government side and  oppose the \r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance if  it  had  been pushed  through. \r\n\r\nThis was in early 1960,  long  before Anson,  Hong Lim and long\r\n\r\nbefore the time  when  there ever  was  this  talk  of  merger. \r\n\r\nSir,  many  of  my colleagues in the trade union movement felt  \r\n\r\nthe  same way, not because we were Communist cadres, but because\r\n\r\nwe  had  all  along  believed  that  the  trade  union movement \r\n\r\nmust be organised on an independent basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  will  remember  the  May  Day celebrations  in\r\n\r\n1960. People who  are  now  in  the Barisan Sosialis had to \r\n\r\nmove a resolution for adoption at the May Day meeting, a resolution\r\n\r\nthat stressed the independence of the trade union movement. People \r\n\r\nlike the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for Culture \r\n\r\nand Mr Devan Nair were hesitant.  These  are facts  and  I am sure\r\n\r\nanyone who chooses to be  honest cannot deny them.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is this talk of Communists mounting industrial unrest and controlling trade unions. Sir, we had to stomach quite a lot when we were with the Government, At times, our patience was tried. As for example, when the police forcibly evicted peaceful strikers at Sassoon & Co, in early 1960. That again was before the Anson and Hong Lim by-elections and before this merger. As trade unionists we, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (there was only one man who was absent and that was Mr Devan Nair; he was at home on that day)\r\n\r\nwent  down  to  the  police  station  and  immediately\r\n\r\nprotested  forcefully  in a statement  issued  to  the\r\n\r\nPress. Sir, the next thing that happened to us was  we\r\n\r\nwere called up to the office of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  rebuked for criticising the Government.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to tell the Government then at the time\r\n\r\nwhen  we were in the P.A.P. openly and publicly if  we\r\n\r\ndisagreed  with  their  labour  policies.

I waited in the  office\r\n\r\ntill 5.30 p.m., met him personally and he gave me that\r\n\r\npersonal assurance. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat very same night I was not in my residence but was\r\n\r\nworking  at Crawford, and I got a telephone call  from\r\n\r\nMr  Kandasamy  asking me to go to the Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation immediately. I said, \"For what?\" He said there\r\n\r\nwas  an  incident and the men in Sassoon  &  Co, were\r\n\r\ninvolved in a clash with the police and some  of  them\r\n\r\nwere injured. I said to Mr Kandasamy that if the  men\r\n\r\nwere  injured, they should be brought to  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital. Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Woodhull then  got  on\r\n\r\nto  the  phone. He was not satisfied with what  I  had\r\n\r\nsaid  to Mr Kandasamy. He spoke to me personally.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Byrne, will you come to the Central Station? We\r\n\r\nneed  you  because if you come here, you  can  lead  a\r\n\r\ndemonstration against the police.\" I said,  \"Woodhull,\r\n\r\nI have nothing to do with a thing like that.\" Now that\r\n\r\nis not known to the Member for Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am sure the Minister for Health and Law\r\n\r\nmust now feel happier.

That is the point  that  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  make, it is not Communist propaganda  if  we\r\n\r\ncondemn  a government for using the police in a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute. Subsequent to the Sassoon strike, as a result\r\n\r\nof     the    discussions    with    the    Government\r\n\r\nMinister - particularly the Prime Minister - we  got  them\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  police  to stop  interfering  in  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes.  I  believe the Minister  for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\ninstructed   the  police  to  keep  away  from   trade\r\n\r\ndisputes. But today, all that is forgotten.  Today  we\r\n\r\nnot  only  have  police officers merrily  intervening.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a ruling that no police officer should  be\r\n\r\nwithin  50  yards  of  a  trade  dispute.

We were not being consulted  on\r\n\r\nGovernment  actions and legislative measures;  but  by\r\n\r\nour  association with the Government we were  supposed\r\n\r\nto  bear  the  brunt  of  responsibility.  It  was   a\r\n\r\nsituation where I would say the Prime Minister  called\r\n\r\nthe  tune  and we were supposed to play the piper.  We\r\n\r\nworked with the Government because we believed that we\r\n\r\nwould see through a rather difficult situation and  it\r\n\r\nwas  in the interest of the workers to show moderation\r\n\r\nand  restraint and pay full attention to the  economic\r\n\r\nfacts  of  our existence in Singapore. We  were  quite\r\n\r\nprepared   to  shoulder  responsibility,  though   the\r\n\r\npolitical sense displayed by most of the Ministers was\r\n\r\nof grave concern to us. In fact, they had no political\r\n\r\nsense and no respect for the workers who brought  them\r\n\r\nto  power.  The Minister for Culture and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance are two clear examples. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, not long after he became\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,  once  told  me,  in  the  presence  of  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull  in the C.P.A. Room, that he would  bust  the\r\n\r\nunions  if it was necessary. It was on the eve of  his\r\n\r\ndeparture    to    London   for    financial    talks.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]. The Minister for Culture  knows  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting  the  Minister for Finance  correctly  because\r\n\r\nthis  is not the first time I have quoted him. I  have\r\n\r\nquoted  him  as having said this before in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office at a meeting when the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture himself was present. He made it quite clear to\r\n\r\na number of us that if there was no P.A.P., then there\r\n\r\nwas  no  T.U.C.  He was trying to intimidate  us  into\r\n\r\ngiving  our  unqualified support to  some  stupid  and\r\n\r\nblind  measures  that  the  Government  had  in  mind.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]. Sir, the T.U.C. functioned from  early\r\n\r\n1960  but  the Communist talk is only now. I am  going\r\n\r\nback  briefly into the past purely to show the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  they  have to talk about the Communists today.  I\r\n\r\nhave said earlier on - I was specific when I was talking\r\n\r\nabout  the  Business Houses Employees Union - that  they\r\n\r\ncould  not attack the Business Houses Employees  Union\r\n\r\nbecause it is doing good work and it has drawn  up  50\r\n\r\nagreements providing for wage increases. They  had  to\r\n\r\nhave  an excuse. What excuse could they think  of  for\r\n\r\nattacking  the  trade union leaders?  They  could  not\r\n\r\npossibly say, \"Mr Lim Ching Siong is a young handsome\r\n\r\nman who is loved by the workers because he: stands for\r\n\r\nthe  workers.\"  They had to cook  up  some  reason  or\r\n\r\nother.  Today  the one way they hope  to  fight  their\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents is to brand them as  Communists - a\r\n\r\nready-made excuse which has been used by the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  least to the extent  of  carrying  out\r\n\r\nrepression.  I have no doubt the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\nquite prepared to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had reasons to be gravely concerned at the\r\n\r\nattempts  of the Government to muzzle the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  when  we were in the P.A.P. Nevertheless  in\r\n\r\nthe  overall interest of co-operation, we  were  quite\r\n\r\nprepared  to  tolerate  a  number  of  things,  hoping\r\n\r\neventually to get the Government to rethink and change\r\n\r\nits  ways. When the T.U.C. was constituted, we allowed\r\n\r\nsome rather obedient servants of the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  not  just to take charge but even  to  throw\r\n\r\ntheir weight about. We were aware of a growing working\r\n\r\nclass  discontent. We were aware of the need  to  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  steps  to  unify the trade  unions  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of industrial peace and stability.  We  have\r\n\r\ntold the Government Ministers this ever since. After a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  haggling, the Trade  Union  Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced.  It  was  debated  and  passed   by   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  We  all  know  what  has  happened  to  it.\r\n\r\nOvernight, there was a reversal of Government  policy.\r\n\r\nThe  registration of four federations of trade  unions\r\n\r\nwas cancelled. The Trade Union Bill was not allowed to\r\n\r\nbecome  law. The P.A.P., before they came  to  office,\r\n\r\nhad  pledged  to  unify the trade union  movement.  We\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  pressed for the unification of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement, for only with unification could there\r\n\r\nbe   order,  discipline  and  fairness  in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.

But in spite of all this,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nunification of the trade union movement in  sight.  We\r\n\r\nhad  been  taken for a jolly good ride. When the  time\r\n\r\ncame  to  test the Government's honesty, we  saw  very\r\n\r\nclearly  that unification was out of the  question  as\r\n\r\nfar  as the P.A.P. was concerned. As we all know,  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. was  dissolved and I do  not  know  why  today\r\n\r\ncontradictory statements are being made. I am sure  we\r\n\r\nare  all  in a position to remember the news  item  we\r\n\r\nread  on  26th  July,  1961 - \"BYRNE  TO  DISSOLVE  THE\r\n\r\nT.U.C.: KANDASAMY TO ORGANISE NEW SET UP: FUNDS WILL\r\n\r\nGO  TO AFFILIATED UNIONS\". Sir, this is supposed to be\r\n\r\na democratic Government. You will remember that we are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be  Communists, the people  who  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in democratic institutions and who are working\r\n\r\nto  wreck  the democratic system. Here is a Government\r\n\r\nwhich self-profess to be democratic, and what do  they\r\n\r\ndo,  Sir? The Minister for Labour and Law, Mr  K.  M.\r\n\r\nByrne,  acting on a request from the T.U.C. Secretary-General, \r\n\r\nMr  G.  Kandasamy, also  arranged  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration of trade unions, to distribute the T.U.C.\r\n\r\nfunds  to  all affiliated unions, and noted  that  Mr\r\n\r\nKandasamy  and  a  number of  his  colleagues  are  to\r\n\r\norganise a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational   Trade  Union  Centre  on  a  non-Communist,\r\n\r\nnational,  democratic,  socialist  basis,   and   also\r\n\r\ndissolve   the   T.U.C.  Sir,   in   this   democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  see  a P.A.P. man  going  to  another\r\n\r\nP.A.P. man  and saying, \"Please dissolve the  T.U.C.\"\r\n\r\nThe T.U.C. had a Secretariat. There was no meeting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Secretariat. The T.U.C. had an Executive Council.\r\n\r\nThere was no meeting of the Executive Council. It  had\r\n\r\ndelegates.  Under the constitution of the T.U.C.,  the\r\n\r\ndissolution  of the T.U.C. must be authorised  by  the\r\n\r\ndelegates    concerned.   There   was   no   delegates\r\n\r\nconference,   no   Executive   Council   meeting,   no\r\n\r\nSecretariat meeting. All that they had to do  was  for\r\n\r\nMr Kandasamy, the Secretary-General of the T.U.C., to\r\n\r\ntell  the  Minister for Labour and Law, \"Dissolve  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.,\" and the T.U.C. was dissolved. I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  decision  to  dissolve was taken  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nCentral   Executive  Committee.  Who  wants  to   play\r\n\r\npolitics in the trade union movement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why did they dissolve the T.U.C.?\r\n\r\nWas it because there were Communist agitators? Was  it\r\n\r\nbecause there were people who were termed evil men, or\r\n\r\nwas  it because they did not have a majority? They did\r\n\r\nnot  have  a majority of men who would be prepared  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  T.U.C. a  subsidiary organisation  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we stood for an independent\r\n\r\ntrade union movement then. We stand for an independent\r\n\r\ntrade union movement now. I am told some of the unions\r\n\r\nare concerned as to what has happened to the funds  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C.  The  Minister then  said  that  he  would\r\n\r\nredistribute the funds to the affiliated unions. But I\r\n\r\nunderstand that to date nothing has been done. We know\r\n\r\nthe reason why the P.A.P. Government does not want  to\r\n\r\nsee  a central body of trade unions, for it knows that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  workers' organisation could not be controlled\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the train of events has made clear the loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the Government within the  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\noutside  it,  and  the Government's hostility  to  the\r\n\r\nunions has become complete. As I have said, it  is  no\r\n\r\nuse coming here and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrying   to  make  suggestions  that  there  will   be\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace. The first thing that the Government\r\n\r\nought to have is the respect of the workers. For  only\r\n\r\nthen  can  it be in a position of prestige to maintain\r\n\r\nindustrial peace. But this is certainly not the  case.\r\n\r\nThe  Government knows full well what I say to be true.\r\n\r\nIn  1959,  immediately  after the  general  elections,\r\n\r\nthere  was  industrial peace; as I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nunprecedented  industrial peace. I  am  sure,  as  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has said, we have 300  Communists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. These 300 Communists were also in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  1959, May, June, July, August, September, October,\r\n\r\nNovember  and December. Early 1960 strikes  increased,\r\n\r\nas  the  Government statistics quite clearly  show.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that in 1960 there were very many more strikes\r\n\r\nthan   in   1959  because  the  workers  were  getting\r\n\r\ndisillusioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government having completely lost the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the workers is now using the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  and  other Government machinery to  break  and\r\n\r\ndiscredit  trade  unions  and trade  union  leadership\r\n\r\nwhich  are not prepared to toe the P.A.P. line. Today,\r\n\r\narbitrary   Government  intervention   in   legitimate\r\n\r\ndisputes of the workers is an everyday occurrence. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  show  bias against  the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nunions  which are unions not under the control of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The best thing the Government can  do  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances is to resign. But since they do not wish\r\n\r\nto  do that, the only sane thing for them to do is  to\r\n\r\nlet the unions and the employers work things out among\r\n\r\nthemselves. There is a far better prospect of peace if\r\n\r\nemployers and unionists could iron things out  between\r\n\r\nthemselves;  if  the Labour Ministry ceases  to  be  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. instrument - it strikes me  sometimes  that  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry is the only branch of the P.A.P. left\r\n\r\nticking.  I  think it is necessary to  warn  employers\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government of today may well have a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest in industrial unrest. The sensible thing  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  do is to be realistic and come to a  lasting\r\n\r\nsettlement  with the employees. We do  not  trust  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  act in a responsible manner.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat all this talk of Communist agitators and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist  unions is merely to carry out a  repression\r\n\r\nof political forces that are against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. came into office with a special\r\n\r\nrecommendation, lt had the support of the workers  and\r\n\r\ntheir trade unions, and was therefore in a position to\r\n\r\nmake  the  slogan  \"industrial peace with  justice\"  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful one. But the power crazy Prime Minister was\r\n\r\ntoo smug once he became Prime Minister. He saw himself\r\n\r\nin  an  indispensable role and wanted  to  ensure  his\r\n\r\nposition  in  that role. Today, the P.A.P. Government,\r\n\r\nby  their  own actions, have lost the support  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who brought it to power. In fact,  they  have\r\n\r\nincurred  the anger and hostility of the workers.  The\r\n\r\nLabour  Front came into office on a militant Left-wing\r\n\r\nplatform and ended up a totally reactionary force. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has travelled the same trodden route, and  has\r\n\r\ncommon  ground  with  its old  opponents  now  in  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A., and so they both talk in the same terms.  They\r\n\r\nboth  talk  of  the Communist threat.  Sir,  the  same\r\n\r\npolicies  that  were rejected by the  people  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  put into force. Mr Speaker, Sir, I need hardly\r\n\r\nstate  the outcome of the anti-worker policies of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I have no doubt that at the end of it all,\r\n\r\nall  this cry of Communism can only mean the graveyard\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, one thing I must say\r\n\r\nabout the Member for Thomson -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He is like an old gramophone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - is that his speeches are written\r\n\r\nby  him, unlike the Member for Queenstown, who is  his\r\n\r\nboss -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - who really talks like a\r\n\r\ngramophone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> What about the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For the best part of the day the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson spent a great deal of time -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> G.

So, Sir, all this long rigmarole, implying\r\n\r\npolice  brutality,  using the police,  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ndoing  this  and that - let me first say  that  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the Communists who run them  can\r\n\r\nget one single picture of actual police brutality,  of\r\n\r\npolice   beating  up  workers,  I  think  the  General\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union would be prepared to pay  $50,000  to\r\n\r\npublish  just one such picture. I have looked  through\r\n\r\ntheir  publications and those of the  S.G.E.U.,  Suara\r\n\r\nKesatuan. They have been publishing pictures  intended\r\n\r\nto   convey  to  the  workers  the  extent  of  police\r\n\r\nbrutality, Government brutality. I refer to the  issue\r\n\r\nof 3lst December, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Unlike the\r\n\r\ngentleman there, I can even read Chinese without being\r\n\r\nable  to  understand a word of it. To  that  extent  I\r\n\r\nemulate the Member for Queenstown. In this publication\r\n\r\nthere  are six pictures intended to convey how  brutal\r\n\r\nand  how  wicked this P.A.P. Government is. The  first\r\n\r\npicture   shows  two  gentlemen  looking   through   a\r\n\r\nwindow - police brutality. The second picture shows  two\r\n\r\npolicemen   talking   to  another  gentleman -   police\r\n\r\nbrutality. The third shows three policemen, with hands\r\n\r\nfolded, watching six\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother    gentlemen,   obviously   conversing -   police\r\n\r\nbrutality.  The  fourth picture shows  four  policemen\r\n\r\njust  facing the camera - police brutality, using police\r\n\r\naction.  The  fifth  is a very bad photograph  but  it\r\n\r\nshows  the  back of a policeman - police brutality.  The\r\n\r\nonly  picture where it shows police brutality  is  the\r\n\r\nsixth  picture, which is a cartoon that  they  had  to\r\n\r\ndraw.  That  is the only picture they can  produce  of\r\n\r\npolice brutality. It shows a policeman with a club and\r\n\r\na  rifle stamping on what looks like a worker. That is\r\n\r\nthe only instance of police brutality that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  could  produce and the Communists,  who  run\r\n\r\nthem,  can  produce. That is police brutality  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

So that\r\n\r\nis  all  they  could produce of police brutality.  You\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of words, pen portraits, fairy tales,  but\r\n\r\nnot a single iota of evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Thomson, in order to build up\r\n\r\nhis  myth  of  an oppressive Government  beating  down\r\n\r\nworkers and to produce evidence of that, spent a great\r\n\r\ndeal of time talking about what he called the historic\r\n\r\nRobinson  strike.  This  is  his  evidence  of  police\r\n\r\nbrutality,   Sir.  So  I  looked  up   some   of   the\r\n\r\nphotographs,  both in the Chinese  Press  and  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Press,  to  check up on  any  evidence  of  a\r\n\r\nbloodstained  worker, of a worker being dragged  about\r\n\r\nwith his arm twisted and so on. All I could find which\r\n\r\ncould  come something near to the use of violence  was\r\n\r\non  the  front  page  of  the Straits  Times  of  12th\r\n\r\nSeptember.  It  shows a picture of a gentleman  called\r\n\r\nFoo  Yong  Fong  who,  I understand,  can  also  write\r\n\r\nbecause the Member for Queenstown read a very polished\r\n\r\npiece of prose by Mr Foo Yong Fong, obviously with  a\r\n\r\nview to impressing upon the workers of Singapore that,\r\n\r\napart   from  rather  strange  habits  like   pressing\r\n\r\ncigarette buts into people -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand that particular\r\n\r\ncase is sub judice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Apart from other accomplishments, he\r\n\r\ncould also write in excellent language. Sir, the  only\r\n\r\nevidence  I could find was a picture here [Indicating]\r\n\r\nof two policemen trying to hold back Mr Foo Yong Fong\r\n\r\nwho was trying to get into a Black Maria. Evidence  of\r\n\r\npolice brutality! Here is a gentleman who is so afraid\r\n\r\nof  the  police that he is struggling to  get  into  a\r\n\r\nBlack  Maria.  That is the nearest one  I  could  come\r\n\r\nacross of the use of any kind of violence on the  part\r\n\r\nof  the leader of the workers. The first picture shows\r\n\r\nthe  police  holding arms to allow  the  workers,  the\r\n\r\nterrified  workers, the workers who were going  to  be\r\n\r\nbeaten  up by the police, oppressed by the Government,\r\n\r\nto  give them a chance to get into the Black Maria  in\r\n\r\nan  orderly  fashion.  There is another  picture  here\r\n\r\n[Indicating]  showing salesgirls and women  clerks  of\r\n\r\nRobinson  walking  out  of  the  store,  laughing  and\r\n\r\nsmiling, into a waiting police van. Evidence of police\r\n\r\nbrutality  and  oppression! Sir, in  a  country  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  strikes - the strike  problem  has  been\r\n\r\nsolved by the People's Democracy which they admired so\r\n\r\nmuch - if there is any suggestion that a police van  is\r\n\r\nanywhere  around the vicinity, it is an  occasion  for\r\n\r\nconsiderable alarm, and perhaps there would be a hasty\r\n\r\nexit  by the back door. But here, under the oppressive\r\n\r\nrule  of  the P.A.P., salesgirls and striking  workers\r\n\r\nwere smiling as they walked into the van. Not only did\r\n\r\nthey  walk into the van with great enthusiasm but  the\r\n\r\npolice  had to keep control, saying, \"You can  get  in\r\n\r\nthere,  but,  please  two at a time.\"  These  are  the\r\n\r\nevidence of police brutality!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, the Member for Thomson spent a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  time quoting instances  of  what  had\r\n\r\nhappened:  \"The  police  were used.  The  police  were\r\n\r\nused.\" In other words, what were the police used  for?\r\n\r\nObviously in this case to help strikers to get into  a\r\n\r\npolice van in an orderly way. In the same issue of the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of  13th September,  1961,  after  the\r\n\r\nstrike  was  over,  we heard a great  deal  about  the\r\n\r\nterrible things the Government did and the police did.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis one portion of the report. Dr Lee Siew Choh said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All reports clearly indicate that the strike at\r\n\r\nRobinson was peaceful from the outset. In fact,  there\r\n\r\nwas  a great deal of friendliness between the strikers\r\n\r\nand the police officers who were placed on duty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  yet  the Member for Thomson spent, I think,  the\r\n\r\nbest  part of an hour on this historic Robinson strike\r\n\r\nwhere the brutal police, the terrible Government,  was\r\n\r\noppressing  the workers. And there was the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis - at\r\n\r\nthat time I do not think the Barisan Sosialis had  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  formed - saying that there was a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nfriendliness between the strikers and police officers.\r\n\r\nHow  is  it that the police who were going to beat  up\r\n\r\nand oppress the workers could be friendly with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Would you allow me to explain,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I wanted to say that there was a\r\n\r\nlot of friendliness between the police and the workers\r\n\r\nuntil  the  police were ordered by the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntake action against the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I have already indicated what\r\n\r\nhappened  after that. The police were helping  smiling\r\n\r\ngirls  to  get into the police van where they insisted\r\n\r\non  going.  If  we had stopped them from going, there\r\n\r\nwould  have  been another statement to say how  brutal\r\n\r\nthis  Government  was because it prevented  salesgirls\r\n\r\nwho  were on strike from getting into the police  van.\r\n\r\nEither way it would have been wrong. But whatever  you\r\n\r\nmight  say,  Sir - and I think the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nwas  quite right - either way the police officers  were\r\n\r\nfriendly. They were helping the salesgirls who  wanted\r\n\r\nto  go to the police station and to get a free ride at\r\n\r\nthe  tax-payers' expense; though it is quite improper,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  ride in a Black Maria without lawful reason.\r\n\r\nBut the P.A.P.

Member:</b> Committing trespass!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Lest it should be thought that we\r\n\r\nwere  oppressing the workers by refusing to allow them\r\n\r\nto get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  free  ride  in  the Black Maria, we suggested  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  police should indulge their  fancy.  All\r\n\r\nthis business of the Robinson strike is an attempt  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  when  they used the  words  \"using  the\r\n\r\npolice\", any implication that we were using the police\r\n\r\nto  heat up the workers is obviously not true.  If  it\r\n\r\nhad  been  true,  there would have  been  a  few  more\r\n\r\nillegal  posters of the photograph all over the  city.\r\n\r\nAll  they  could do, as I have said, was  to  draw  a\r\n\r\ncartoon  suggesting that the police had used  violence\r\n\r\nand intimidation. That is a measure of the accuracy of\r\n\r\nmany of the statements by the Barisan Sosialis. I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand what happened, because, just to be fair  to\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, obviously when the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has nobody prompting him, he is a  cornered\r\n\r\nman. He was with the P.A.P., so he spoke honestly.  On\r\n\r\nthe   same  day  there  was  another  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nPreparatory  Committee  of  the  S.A.T.U.  Nobody  had\r\n\r\nphoned  him up and told him what the line was, because\r\n\r\nat  that  meeting  there  were  denunciations  of  the\r\n\r\npolice.  Obviously if the reporter had  gone  there  a\r\n\r\ncouple of hours later, the Member for Queenstown would\r\n\r\nhave  given a different version. As we know,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly very often he takes the wrong line, much\r\n\r\nto the consternation of many of his colleagues outside\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. I do not think any of the workers  are\r\n\r\nvery  much  taken in by the Barisan Sosialis'  attempt\r\n\r\nduring  the  last nine months to build up  hatred  and\r\n\r\nindignation against the Government. So today they  are\r\n\r\nput  in  a  position  of saying, \"We  are  really  not\r\n\r\ninterested in strikes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Thomson did not know how to\r\n\r\nend  up  his  peroration. So he decided that  we,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  have  a  vested  interest  in   promoting\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest.  This is the first  time  we  have\r\n\r\nheard  it.  Obviously the whole thing has misfired.  I\r\n\r\nshall  show later the whole purpose of this industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  which  the  Barisan Sosialis  have  generated.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two different types of industrial  unrest.\r\n\r\nThere   is   industrial  unrest   based   on   genuine\r\n\r\ndiscontent.  There  have been  many  strikes  by  non-Communist-controlled unions, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  has in no way  suggested  for  one\r\n\r\nmoment  that  those strikes are Communist  strikes  or\r\n\r\nCommunist-controlled  strikes.  There  was  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil  strike. Nobody ever said that  those  strikes\r\n\r\nwere Communist-controlled or Communist-inspired. There\r\n\r\nwas  the  Army Civil Service Union strike.  A  lot  of\r\n\r\nindividual  firms  had strikes. But  we  must  make  a\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  strikes  by  leaders   who   are\r\n\r\ninterested  in promoting the economic welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the Communists who are  using  them  for\r\n\r\npolitical ends. As I shall show later on, the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are not interested in promoting the  welfare\r\n\r\nof   the  workers,  but  in  promoting  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nCommunism.  It  is  very interesting  that  throughout\r\n\r\nyesterday  and today, Members of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nkept   on   saying,   \"Communist  bogey\";   \"so-called\r\n\r\nCommunists\";  \"Communist smear\". But they  never  said\r\n\r\none  word which would dispose of our allegation -  deny\r\n\r\nthat  they are Communists; deny that the men  who  run\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis  or  some  of  them  are   not\r\n\r\nCommunists. They never denied that. That fits in  with\r\n\r\nthe Communist strategy, Sir. According to the textbook\r\n\r\nmanual,  Lenin says, a good Communist must be prepared\r\n\r\nto  lie  to  cover up the fact that he is a Communist.\r\n\r\nThat is part of the Communist technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You never read the statement of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In fact, Sir, a few days ago, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Nee Soon, in the course of  an  argument,\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I am not a Communist.\" I say very good. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  first time I have heard a Barisan Sosialis Member\r\n\r\nsaying categorically that he is not a Communist.  Then\r\n\r\nI  asked, \"Would you therefore be prepared to tell the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore - the Government is  prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive  you  radio time to go on the air - 'Why  I  oppose\r\n\r\nCommunism. Why I reject Communism.'?\" First he  said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" Then he said, \"No. I will consider it.\" Then he\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Please write to me.\" I have written to him  two\r\n\r\nor three days ago, and not a peep out of him. Whatever\r\n\r\nthey might say - they might say smear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  so on, which they do say - they have not said,  \"We\r\n\r\nare  not Communists. If you say we are Communists,  we\r\n\r\nare  prepared to come and repudiate it.\" Better still,\r\n\r\ncome out and say why you are not a Communist. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  most  convincing way to say I am not a Communist,\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"These  are the reasons  why  I  am  not  a\r\n\r\nCommunist.\" If any Member of the Barisan Sosialis  can\r\n\r\nsay  that  publicly - come out anywhere, write  in  any\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  talk  over  the  radio,  \"Why   I   reject\r\n\r\nCommunism,\" then we will believe him. But I  can  give\r\n\r\nan  assurance,  Sir, that not a single Member  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis or the men who run the Party will  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept this open invitation to  come  and\r\n\r\ntalk over the radio, saying. \"Why we reject Communism.\r\n\r\nWhy  we  think Communism is unsuitable for Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nIt  is quite clear that they are getting more and more\r\n\r\nuncomfortable over this motion, because the essence of\r\n\r\nCommunist strategy, as I shall read out from extracts,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  big  Lenin -  these are  the  small  Lenins -telling  how it is necessary for Communists to conceal\r\n\r\ntheir  identity when working in unions  and  political\r\n\r\nParties. And these are men who are learning the  task.\r\n\r\nA  good Communist would not use these tactics, saying,\r\n\r\n\"It  is a smear\". He would say, \"I am not a Communist.\r\n\r\nI   am  prepared  even  to  swear  that  I  am  not  a\r\n\r\nCommunist.\" He is prepared to argue. A good  Communist\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  do  that.  But  these  are  only\r\n\r\ntenderfoots. So, therefore, they have been reduced for\r\n\r\nthe  time being to saying, \"Oh, it is all a smear.  It\r\n\r\nis a bogey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me therefore start off with the whole thesis of\r\n\r\nour  argument about the industrial strife. Some of the 13  Assemblymen will get an opportunity  to  reply  to\r\n\r\nthis.  There are two categories of industrial  unrest.\r\n\r\nOne of them springs from the genuine discontent of the\r\n\r\nworkers motivated by the desire to improve their  lot.\r\n\r\nTo  that  extent, the Government has never in any  way\r\n\r\nmade  any attempt to hamper them in so far as they  go\r\n\r\nabout  their  business of carrying out the  industrial\r\n\r\ndispute   against   employers   in   a   lawful    and\r\n\r\nconstitutional manner. In fact, the Government has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noften  gone  out  of its way to assist  them.  But\r\n\r\nwhere   we  know  that  the  Communist  industrial\r\n\r\ndispute   has  not  the  slightest  intention   of\r\n\r\nincreasing the living standard of the workers  but\r\n\r\nhas other objectives, to that extent we single  it\r\n\r\nout.  The Member for Thomson kept on saying,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is smearing trade unionists,\"  and\r\n\r\nso  on. We are not smearing trade unionists,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWe  are  smearing certain trade unionists whom  we\r\n\r\nhave  named.  One of them is the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof   the  Barisan  Sosialis,  a  prominent   trade\r\n\r\nunionist   who,   we  have  said   repeatedly   in\r\n\r\nstatements outside and inside the Assembly, is  an\r\n\r\nopen  front  Communist  leader.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown kept on saying, \"Oh, this is a  bogey,\"\r\n\r\nand that we were imagining things. All right, Sir.\r\n\r\nIs  this imagination? This is from the Battle  For\r\n\r\nMerger,  about which hook a lot of questions  were\r\n\r\nasked.  So I can understand why this hook  becomes\r\n\r\nmore  and  more embarrassing because  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndocument  here  by Mr Lim Ching  Siong,  part  of\r\n\r\nwhich reads as follows [Page 120]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must forever remember: We have already sworn\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Red  flag  and old  Stalin.  We  must\r\n\r\nresolutely   uphold   the   interests    of    the\r\n\r\nOrganisation   at   all  times   and   under   all\r\n\r\ncircumstances.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bogey, Sir? Old Stalin and Red flag. Is it a\r\n\r\nbogey, imagination, a forgery? He is placed behind\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis and the trade union movement\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the Barisan Sosialis.  Communist\r\n\r\nbogey? Denial? We would have laughed, if they said\r\n\r\nit  was a forgery. There is no denial. All we  had\r\n\r\nwas  \"a smear\"; not that it is false; not that  it\r\n\r\nis  a forgery; it is a smear; it is a bogey. Then,\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir, not so many years  ago,  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill was in the saddle,  certain\r\n\r\ngentlemen -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why call them gentleman?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - comrades were suddenly\r\n\r\naccused in those days of being pro-Communists  and\r\n\r\nCommunists.  They used to say it was a  smear  and\r\n\r\nthey  still  say it is a smear. Sir, may  I  quote\r\n\r\nalso from the Battle For Merger documents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich certainly show that far from Communism being\r\n\r\na   bogey  and  a  smear  and  a  figment  of  our\r\n\r\nimagination, these gentlemen are conscious of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Communists are here.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nstatement signed by Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan,  Lim\r\n\r\nChing Siong, Devan Nair and Chan Chiaw Thor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"It was not the might of British arms which\r\n\r\ndefeated the armed revolt led by the M.C.P....\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot imagine British arms fighting a\r\n\r\nbogey;  eight  years, nine years,  they  obviously\r\n\r\nfought an organisation which exists. In fact,  the\r\n\r\ntruth  must  be  told. The M.C.P. is  the  oldest\r\n\r\npolitical   Party  in  Malaya.  Has  it   vanished\r\n\r\novernight?  Are  we  imagining  things?  Here  are\r\n\r\nMessrs. Woodhull, Fong Swee Suan, Lim Ching Siong,\r\n\r\nDevan  Nair  and Chan Chiaw Thor talking  of  real\r\n\r\nthings  that  exist.  Again in  another  statement\r\n\r\ncalled  \"The  Road to Socialism in an  Independent\r\n\r\nMalaya\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No sane person can claim today that the M.C.P.\r\n\r\nrevolt  is  directed  against British  Imperialist\r\n\r\ndomination of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they talking of a bogey directed against\r\n\r\nBritish  imperialism? A figment of the imagination\r\n\r\nbeing  directed against the British  imperialists?\r\n\r\nOr  was  it  something real? Another statement  by\r\n\r\nJames  Puthucheary  who now says  all  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsmear. In fact, he says he is not quite sure there\r\n\r\nare  Communists, and yet he has written a  letter.\r\n\r\nSir, this is the hard cover edition, page 196, in\r\n\r\nwhich (just the relevant part of the sentence)  he\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n`...I broke with my political friends in 1951,...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Lest  we  should  be in doubt  as  to  who  these\r\n\r\npolitical friends are, he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Though I had rejected some of what were\r\n\r\nconsidered  basic  tenets,  and  was  critical  of\r\n\r\nCommunist regimentation...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I cannot imagine Mr James Puthucheary being\r\n\r\nregimented. A figment of the imagination. Then  he\r\n\r\ngoes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My return from Communism ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And yet he used to say it was a smear. He says  it\r\n\r\ndoes not exist and the Members opposite today  say\r\n\r\nthe same thing - \"It is a smear. Communism does not\r\n\r\nexist.\" A figment of their imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe  one day they will be writing documents  for  us\r\n\r\nsaying \"My return from Communism\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before we start discussing the problem of\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest, it is necessary to start  with  the\r\n\r\nbasic  reality  that  Communism is  a  movement  which\r\n\r\nexists  with specific aims and purposes, and  that  in\r\n\r\nthis  industrial unrest, it is a big  factor  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  are  one  of  the  factors  in  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  conspiracy in Singapore and Malaya  and  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. If you start off with the assumption that it\r\n\r\nis  all  a  smear,  a figment of the imagination,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  thing becomes meaningless. The hard  facts  are\r\n\r\nthere.  The gentlemen who know this admit and  concede\r\n\r\nthat   these  are  the  realities  of  the   political\r\n\r\nsituation.  So  once we work on that basis,  then  all\r\n\r\nthis  business about the Government being  brutal  and\r\n\r\noppressing  the workers becomes clear.  Why  they  are\r\n\r\nsaying  this  and  why  they are fomenting  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  is  because,  as  a  Communist  Party  and   a\r\n\r\nCommunist  group, they are doing the things which  are\r\n\r\nexpected  of  them  as Communists.  Their  brutalising\r\n\r\ntechniques  are things which are expected of  them  as\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my purpose to start from the realities, the\r\n\r\nfacts, that the Barisan Sosialis is a Communist  front\r\n\r\norganisation being manipulated for Communist ends, and\r\n\r\nthat all the stories we have heard are explainable  if\r\n\r\nthis basic reality is accepted. Sir, nobody who is  of\r\n\r\nsound mind - and that includes the Barisan Sosialis - will\r\n\r\ndeny that there is mounting industrial unrest and that\r\n\r\nit  is on a scale to warrant concern by this Assembly.\r\n\r\nEven  the Member for Anson, who argued that there  was\r\n\r\nno  cause  for  alarm  because he loved  strikes,  was\r\n\r\nnevertheless  constrained to move an amendment  asking\r\n\r\nthe  Government to take all possible steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice. Even  he  accepts  the\r\n\r\nfact,  whatever the reason, that there  is  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.  Sir,  insofar  as the  Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nconfined himself to facts to show that there has  been\r\n\r\nan  abnormal increase of strikes in recent months,  he\r\n\r\nwas  being  objective. However, when  dealing  with  a\r\n\r\npolitician of the calibre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  experience of the Member for Cairnhill, one  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  little bit wary of some of the not  so  helpful\r\n\r\nsuggestions  he occasionally offers to the Government.\r\n\r\nHe  professed  to offer us buckets of water  yesterday\r\n\r\nand  today  to  help put out the fires  of  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest, but occasionally I noticed he was slipping  in\r\n\r\nbuckets of kerosene. In fact, one of the great sources\r\n\r\nof   disappointment  for  the  pro-Communists  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and in their  unions  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not tried to dampen industrial  unrest\r\n\r\nby pouring buckets of kerosene -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Pouring oil on troubled waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What has been and is annoying the\r\n\r\npro-Communists is that the Government  has  not  sided\r\n\r\nwith the employers as they say we do; that it has,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  not  sided with employers to bust  up  strikes,\r\n\r\nincluding  political  strikes  fomented  by  the  pro-Communists,  or persecute labour leaders  or  use  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  beat  up  strikers.  We  have  denied  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  opportunities  for  sparking  off  violent\r\n\r\nclashes  between  workers  and  police.  We  have  not\r\n\r\nbehaved in the way that Communist manuals say that  an\r\n\r\nanti-worker government should behave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the ordinary worker even when on\r\n\r\nstrike  does  not  resort to  violence  unless  he  is\r\n\r\nprovoked into it either by a blundering government  or\r\n\r\nunless  he  has a violent and abiding hatred  for  the\r\n\r\ngovernment. None of these factors are present  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  That  is  why though the pro-Communists  have\r\n\r\ntried  their level best to convert legitimate workers'\r\n\r\ngrievances  into  a violent political assault  against\r\n\r\nthe  Government, they have not been able to make  much\r\n\r\nheadway. The ordinary worker is ready to go on  strike\r\n\r\nto  get  better conditions and where he has done  this\r\n\r\npurely   to   get   better  working  conditions,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has either offered to help him settle  the\r\n\r\ndispute;  or  even  where he has  been  manoeuvred  by\r\n\r\nCommunist  politicians  into  carrying  on  with   the\r\n\r\nstrike,  the  Government has not interfered  with  his\r\n\r\nright to strike peacefully -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As  I\r\n\r\nhave said, there is a distinction between workers  who\r\n\r\ngo  on  strike  wholly and primarily to improve  their\r\n\r\nconditions  of work, and strikes organised by  certain\r\n\r\nleaders  for the purpose of furthering Communist  ends\r\n\r\nand  Communist objectives. We concede to  workers  who\r\n\r\nare  willing to go on strike to get better  conditions\r\n\r\nof  pay,  and where they have done this the Government\r\n\r\nhas either offered to help settle the dispute or, even\r\n\r\nwhere   they   have  been  manoeuvred   by   Communist\r\n\r\npoliticians  into carrying on with a strike,  has  not\r\n\r\ninterfered   with   the  workers'  right   to   strike\r\n\r\npeacefully. Therefore, the Communist myth of a wicked,\r\n\r\noppressive,  brutal  and  anti-worker  Government   is\r\n\r\ndifficult to sustain. This being the case, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  leaders  and  the trade  union  leaders  are\r\n\r\nreduced  to  merely  creating  imaginary  pictures  of\r\n\r\nviolence  and brutality on the part of the Government.\r\n\r\nSir,  the mere presence of the police near the pickets\r\n\r\nto  ensure that peace and order are maintained is,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  propaganda,  transformed  into\r\n\r\nFascist oppression by the police. Any and every  wordy\r\n\r\naltercation between the police and the workers,  which\r\n\r\noften  happens  during a strike, is distorted  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   propagandists   into   a   bloody\r\n\r\noppression and persecution of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sort of fabrication can only serve to\r\n\r\npuzzle  the workers who may have seen with  their  own\r\n\r\neyes  that these instances of brutality were  no  more\r\n\r\nthan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  usual incidents where the police are called  upon\r\n\r\nto ensure the preservation of peace and order during a\r\n\r\nstrike.  Because the police have not resorted to  acts\r\n\r\nof  violence and brutality against workers on  strike,\r\n\r\nit  has  become  necessary for the  pro-Communists  in\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. to   resort  to  acts   of   violence   and\r\n\r\nintimidation  against  the  workers.  The  motive   is\r\n\r\nobvious.   By  carrying  out  acts  of  violence   and\r\n\r\nintimidation themselves, the Communists know that they\r\n\r\nwill be inviting intervention by the police who have a\r\n\r\nduty  to  see  that law and order are  preserved.  But\r\n\r\nsince the police have refused to be provoked into acts\r\n\r\nof  violence,  the  Communists themselves  indulge  in\r\n\r\ndisplays  of violence against the workers in order  to\r\n\r\nattract  their  attention and genially  to  create  an\r\n\r\nimpression  that industrial violence is  taking  place\r\n\r\nand  that  the Government and the police  are  somehow\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   such   incidents.   So   such   an\r\n\r\nintervention  could then be presented as  evidence  of\r\n\r\npolice violence and intimidation. However, it is quite\r\n\r\nclear  from  the agitation of the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nthat   these   fairy  tales  about  intimidation   and\r\n\r\noppression by the State have so far failed to cut  any\r\n\r\nice  with  the  workers. So the Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nreduced to merely uttering the refrain that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  anti-worker,  Pro-capitalist  and   is\r\n\r\nworking  hand  in glove with Japanese capitalists,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Queenstown alleged, that the  workers\r\n\r\nare groaning under the reactionary heel of the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nand  that  they  live in fear of P.A.P. brutality  and\r\n\r\noppression. Sir, it is quite clear that not  even  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Assemblymen really believe all  this.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  what they say we are, then not  a  single\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Assemblyman will be in this  Chamber\r\n\r\nto  make tongue-in-cheek allegations of this sort.  If\r\n\r\nwe  are really anti-worker and pro-employer, if we are\r\n\r\nreally  determined  to  use  violence  and  oppression\r\n\r\nagainst the workers, then I can assure you, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthere  will not be a single strike in Singapore today.\r\n\r\nMay  I  suggest  to  the Barisan  Sosialis  that  even\r\n\r\nfalsehoods,  to  be  effective,  must  at   least   be\r\n\r\nplausible.  They cannot convince the people  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  an  enemy  of the  workers  and  is  using\r\n\r\nviolence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst them when, in fact, it is the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nstrong-arm  men who have to intimidate fellow  workers\r\n\r\nand   do  violence  to  other  workers.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  There is not a single instance,  and  they\r\n\r\ncannot produce a single instance, where the Government\r\n\r\nhas used unlawful violence or unjust force against the\r\n\r\nworkers. But the Barisan Sosialis leaders have had  to\r\n\r\nuse violence to intimidate the workers into supporting\r\n\r\nthem.  In  fact,  the Member for Thomson,  who  always\r\n\r\nplays  about with half-truths, said that an  editorial\r\n\r\nof  the  Petir  attacked the workers of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses Employees Union. If he had  read  the\r\n\r\neditorial, he would have discovered that it was not an\r\n\r\nattack  against the workers of the Singapore  Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Employees Union but against the pro-Communists\r\n\r\nwho  are  manipulating  the white-collar  workers  for\r\n\r\nCommunist ends. In fact, the editorial gave an account\r\n\r\nof  the  rally  that  the  Singapore  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union organised under the cloak  that  they\r\n\r\nwere calling a mass meeting to explain the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  commercial  workers in Singapore.  That  was  the\r\n\r\npretext  given to entice workers to come to this  mass\r\n\r\nrally. But, in fact, what happened was that on the day\r\n\r\nof  the meeting numerous buses were parked outside the\r\n\r\nvarious  business houses, and as the workers came  out\r\n\r\nthey were shepherded by the stewards who told them  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  buses because they had to  go  to  this\r\n\r\nmeeting.  So  they were dragooned into going  to  this\r\n\r\nmass  rally where it became clear to the workers,  who\r\n\r\nhad  gone there expecting to hear something about  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the white-collar workers - the meeting  did\r\n\r\nnot  start until well past the schedule time; then  at\r\n\r\nseven,  there  was a long harangue all  about  merger,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and so on - that there was nothing  about  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of the white-collar workers. At about  seven\r\n\r\no'clock, the Chairman of the meeting said, \"Well,  our\r\n\r\nMuslim brothers are here and it is the Puasa month. So\r\n\r\nthose  who want to go and break their fast may leave.\"\r\n\r\nSo  the  hail  became spectacularly empty because  the\r\n\r\nMuslims and the non-Muslims made a bolt for the  door.\r\n\r\nThere were little altercations. A number of ladies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Well, I have come to this meeting to hear about\r\n\r\nthe  problems of the white-collar workers.  I  have  a\r\n\r\nchild  who  has not been fed and I have  been  sitting\r\n\r\nhere  at  this meeting listening to merger.  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand so on.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This editorial was intended to show the typical\r\n\r\nCommunist strategy: first you urged people into  buses\r\n\r\nand  made  quite  sure  that nobody  escaped  at  five\r\n\r\no'clock. The buses were waiting there; gentlemen  were\r\n\r\nlooking  around and everyone was given a card so  that\r\n\r\nthey  knew  who  came  and who did  not  come  to  the\r\n\r\nmeeting.  Then  at  seven o'clock, the  people  became\r\n\r\nhungry. Everybody wanted to break the fast - Muslims and\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims.  The hail was half-empty. Mr  Bani,  who\r\n\r\nwas  supposed to be the last speaker, appealed to  the\r\n\r\nmembers,  \"Please, it will not be a long speech,\"  and\r\n\r\nthe  meeting closed earlier than expected. This  is  a\r\n\r\ntypical strategy of the pro-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Member for Thomson said that the\r\n\r\neditorial  was attacking the workers in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  House  Employees  Union,  he  was  obviously\r\n\r\nstating a falsehood. But the attack was on the way the\r\n\r\nCommunists  are  trying  to dragoon  the  white-collar\r\n\r\nworkers to their revolutionary machine. I do not think\r\n\r\nthey  are  getting very far with it. That is  why  you\r\n\r\nnotice that the Member for Thomson today spent a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  his  time making a speech intended  for  the\r\n\r\nwhite-collar  workers.  He said.  \"We  are  reasonable\r\n\r\nchaps.  It  is  the  Government  which  has  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  in starting strikes and industrial  strife.\"\r\n\r\nBy  and  large, the white-collar workers are beginning\r\n\r\nto realise that they might welcome assistance from the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis insofar as they manage to get  better\r\n\r\nconditions  of  work.  We are  not  denying  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have not done that.  But  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing  that only as an inducement and a bribe  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  white-collar workers are hitched  on  to  a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary chariot which everybody knows is set  on\r\n\r\na  course  where  the  end of the  line  is  a  cliff.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that, even the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they talk of the P.A.P. Government being\r\n\r\nanti-worker and being repressive, nobody believes  it.\r\n\r\nHow genuine are the Barisan Sosialis leaders when they\r\n\r\nsay  all these things about the P.A.P, being an  anti-worker  Government? Again in the Petir of  17th  June,\r\n\r\n1961, Mr S. Woodhull wrote an article. This was about\r\n\r\nnine  months ago. Sir, Mr Woodhull is something of  a\r\n\r\npundit  in  the  Barisan Sosialis, and echoes  of  his\r\n\r\nliterary  style  from time to time  emanate  from  the\r\n\r\nmouth  of  the Member for Queenstown. The  article  is\r\n\r\nentitled  \"Two  Years of Concrete  Progress\".  It  was\r\n\r\npublished  in June last year, just before  the  split,\r\n\r\nand  the  progress,  I can assure you,  Sir,  did  not\r\n\r\nrelate  to  the progress of Mr Woodhull  but  to  the\r\n\r\nprogress  which  he claimed the P.A.P. Government  had\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what Mr Woodhull, now the script writer\r\n\r\nfor  the Barisan Sosialis, had to say about the labour\r\n\r\npolicies   of   the   P.A.P.  Government   which   his\r\n\r\nmouthpiece,  the Member for Queenstown, now  denounces\r\n\r\nas   anti-worker,  as  having  done  nothing  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Let me quote from a rather lengthy  article -   obviously  we had made -a lot of progress  during  the\r\n\r\ntwo  years, so it took him four pages, 12 columns,  to\r\n\r\nset  down our achievements. But I shall not weary  the\r\n\r\nHouse with all of it but take some extracts in so  far\r\n\r\nas they relate to our labour policies. This is what he\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a reflection of the new spirit that now obtains\r\n\r\nin  the  trade union front, considerable  changes  and\r\n\r\nimprovements  of working conditions have been  brought\r\n\r\nabout since the P.A.P, came into office.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yet  the  same  script  writer gets  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  to  say  that nothing has  been  achieved.\r\n\r\nWorkers  have  suffered under the  P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nHere  is  Mr  Woodhull saying on  the  contrary  that\r\n\r\n\"considerable  changes  and  improvements  of  working\r\n\r\nconditions  have been brought about since  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncame into office.\" He says that one union has drawn up\r\n\r\nover  300  agreements concerning  improved  wages  and\r\n\r\nother working conditions in the last 18 months. That\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  something  like one agreement  every  three  days\r\n\r\nduring the past two succeeding years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> They must have been\r\n\r\nworking overtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They were not only working overtime,\r\n\r\nbut obviously working all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This historic change [not just a change, Sir, but a\r\n\r\nhistoric change] in the industrial situation has  been\r\n\r\nmade possible because government has made it clear  to\r\n\r\nemployers that they will have to respect the rights of\r\n\r\ntrade unions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This was written nine months ago-two months before the\r\n\r\nbreak occurred between the non-Communists and the pro-Communists in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again Sir, we have heard a lot about the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nvictimising  the  workers,  pushing  them  around,  no\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  the  workers,  lost  contact  with  the\r\n\r\nworkers  - you  have heard all that, Sir. Mr  Woodhull\r\n\r\nhad this to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The days of victimisation of trade unionists and\r\n\r\nworkers  are  over.  The law is now being  effectively\r\n\r\nimplemented and workers are having the full benefit of\r\n\r\nit  all.  As a result of the effective application  of\r\n\r\nthe  law, workers have received $l,628,670.47  due  to\r\n\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir, you will note that Mr Woodhull was such  a\r\n\r\nstickler  for accuracy that he worked it  out  to  the\r\n\r\nlast 47 cents. I cannot say of the script which he now\r\n\r\nwrites  for  the  Member  for  Queenstown  as  regards\r\n\r\naccuracy  of  facts.  But  in  this  case  there   was\r\n\r\n$1,628,670.47  cents. These were the things  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  got in addition as a result of the  effective\r\n\r\napplication of the law during the past two years.  Yet\r\n\r\nagain, Sir, Mr Woodhull wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister for Labour and Law had informed the\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  companies  that  they  could  no  longer\r\n\r\nexploit the workers and, as a result of this, $700,000\r\n\r\nwas  paid to the members of the Singapore Bus  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion. These are only a few examples of how Government\r\n\r\nhas actively helped improve the bargaining position of\r\n\r\nhundreds of unions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as he said, these are only a few examples. We\r\n\r\ngave  him  four  pages due to lack of space,  and  due\r\n\r\nregard  for  the  modesty of the Government  no  doubt\r\n\r\nprevented   Mr   Woodhull  from  specifying   further\r\n\r\nexamples  of the concrete progress that had been  made\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. during its two years of office.  Then,\r\n\r\nSir, like a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  non-Communist democrat, he  sums  up  the  whole\r\n\r\nthing  in  two very punchy slogans - it is all in  black\r\n\r\ntype, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Gone are the days of repression of trade union\r\n\r\nactivity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yet  we hear the Barisan Sosialis Members saying  how\r\n\r\nwe  are  oppressing the workers. As far back as  June,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  less than a year ago, there was nothing  of\r\n\r\nthat  kind. \"Gone are the days of repression of  trade\r\n\r\nunion activity.\" And still further, a second slogan:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Trade unions have achieved a new dignity under a\r\n\r\nnew Government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  do  not  know what Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  think of Mr Woodhull. Obviously there  must\r\n\r\nbe  two  Mr  Woodhull. The problem that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have is to decide which is the  genuine  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull  that  they have to live with;  the  one  who\r\n\r\nwrote  this or the one who writes some of the speeches\r\n\r\nthat  Members of the Barisan Sosialis utter from  time\r\n\r\nto  time. Mr Woodhull was either lying here or he was\r\n\r\nlying in the speeches that are often read out in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  I do not know, but would they say  that  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull, the real revolutionary, a man of the people,\r\n\r\nwrote this for $1,100 as Political Secretary, or is he\r\n\r\nwriting other speeches for far less pay for the cause?\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  problem that the Barisan Sosialis  must\r\n\r\ndecide  for themselves: which is the real Mr Woodhull\r\n\r\nwho  is speaking the truth? Or has he got two tongues\r\n\r\nin his cheek?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the one hand, we are told that we are\r\n\r\noppressors of the workers; we are terrible people;  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  contact with the workers. And  here  is  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull,  who is not only a prominent member  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  but I understand  he  now  conducts\r\n\r\npolitical classes for Barisan Sosialis cadres  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions, especially in the English-speaking trade\r\n\r\nunions.  Sir,  is  he  a searcher  for  truth?  Is  he\r\n\r\nconducting  the same type of classes,  of  writing  or\r\n\r\nspeaking with his tongue in his cheek as he did  here,\r\n\r\nor  is  he, since he left the P.A.P. no longer a  non-Communist  socialist? Or has he, therefore,  taken  to\r\n\r\nthe ethics of the Communist techniques, which say that\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for a good revolutionary sometimes to\r\n\r\nconceal his ideas and, if necessary, sacrifice  truth,\r\n\r\ni.e., it may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for him to speak falsehoods? So this is  one\r\n\r\nof the problems that the Barisan Sosialis will have to\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I notice that the Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson and a few others took great care to fasten\r\n\r\ntheir  attack  on one of their former colleagues.  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan Nair. In fact, some rather scathing remarks were\r\n\r\nmade  suggesting that Mr Devan Nair is a phoney trade\r\n\r\nunionist, that he also was one of the chaps who joined\r\n\r\nin  to  oppress the workers. Let me contrast him  with\r\n\r\nMr  Woodhull,  who wrote this when he  was  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary  drawing $1,100. As for Mr Devan Nair,  let\r\n\r\nus  tell  them  that he was offered the  same  job  as\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary, carrying a salary of $1,100.  And\r\n\r\nvery  early on i.e, a few months later, having  worked\r\n\r\nwith  the gentleman who now says that he is a  phoney,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  \"I  am afraid lots of things are  going  to\r\n\r\nhappen. So it is better for me not to accept this  job\r\n\r\nbecause  when  I signed the statement  saying  that  I\r\n\r\nreally believed in non-Communist socialism for Malaya,\r\n\r\nI  was  sincere about it. And there will come  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  those  who  signed  that  statement  with  their\r\n\r\ntongues in their cheeks would smear me.\" So he decided\r\n\r\nto  quit  the  job to take on a job as a  teacher  for\r\n\r\n$530.  That  is  his salary today. He is  now  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  Adult Education, and he is  getting  far\r\n\r\nless  than many of the Junior Officers connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board. He was a far-sighted  man.\r\n\r\nHe  knew  that  if he had stayed on, they  would  have\r\n\r\nsmeared  him.  Today they cannot smear  him,  but  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull, Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan, and\r\n\r\nMr  James  Puthucheary, cannot say either  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  working  as  paid hacks for the  Government  for\r\n\r\n$1,100  each  and  were sincerely carrying  out  their\r\n\r\nduties,  or  they  were  working  for  the  Government\r\n\r\nbecause  they  believed in the things that  they  said\r\n\r\nthey believed. Therefore, Sir, let them not query  the\r\n\r\nsincerity of people who have nothing to be ashamed of.\r\n\r\nMr Devan Nair draws $530 a month and has been drawing\r\n\r\nthat  for the last two years, and yet he wrote  things\r\n\r\nwhich  he  believed in. Whether Mr Woodhull  and  his\r\n\r\nfriends can say the same thing is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent  matter. I do not want to weary  the  House,\r\n\r\nSir.  Even Mr Lint Ching Siong and Mr Fong Swee Suan\r\n\r\nhave   made  similar  speeches  praising  and   giving\r\n\r\ncredentials  to the Government for the  way  in  which\r\n\r\nthey have stood on the side of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these testimonials from Mr Woodhull, Mr\r\n\r\nFong  and Mr Lim, there is yet another reason why  no\r\n\r\nworker  believes the Barisan Sosialis charge  that  we\r\n\r\nare now oppressing the workers and have joined up with\r\n\r\nthe capitalists. The simple reason is that none of  us\r\n\r\non  this side of the House are capitalists. We own  no\r\n\r\nshares or enterprises or factories. So what capitalist\r\n\r\ninterests  are  we out to protect? So on  every  count\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  a  shred of evidence  to  sustain  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  myth that we are anti-worker.  We  are  not\r\n\r\ncapitalists   ourselves  or  in   the   pay   of   any\r\n\r\ncapitalists. We have not beaten up workers, or  broken\r\n\r\nup  strikes  or  persecuted  workers.  And  until  the\r\n\r\npolitical  break less than a year ago, Sir,  Mr  Lim,\r\n\r\nMr  Woodhull  and the rest who are  now  bearing  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  chop, were openly proclaiming  that\r\n\r\nthis   was   a   pro-workers'  Government.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhen - that  is the problem - did we cease to  be  a  pro-workers'  Government?  As far as  the  evidence  goes,\r\n\r\nobviously in June last year we were all right. We were\r\n\r\non the side of the workers. So when did we cease to be\r\n\r\non the side of the workers? If you look at the facts,\r\n\r\nSir,  the time is roughly after the Anson by-election.\r\n\r\nSo  what  happened?  As far as we know,  we  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged   our  policy.  There  have  been  no  drastic\r\n\r\nchanges.  So what happened between June and  September\r\n\r\nto  convert  us  from  a  pro-Workers'  Government,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  which is on the side of the workers,  into\r\n\r\none  which has now become Fascist, pro-capitalist  and\r\n\r\nanti-worker? I suggest that the reasons are political.\r\n\r\nThe  reasons have to do with our decision to  get  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  to declare their stand on merger.  It  was\r\n\r\nsince   then  that  the  Communists  in  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis -  in  fact, Sir, I think  the  term  \"Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\" is a deception. Nobody believes the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a better thing for them to change the name and call\r\n\r\nthemselves  Barisan  Communists. Everytime  they  keep\r\n\r\ntalking  of socialism, socialism, socialism, everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  they  mean Communism.  Probably  all  the\r\n\r\ntroubles  that  they  have landed themselves  in  were\r\n\r\nbecause they started with a false name, a false  chop,\r\n\r\nand  false credentials. Because of that, they  are  in\r\n\r\nextreme difficulties today. The reason why they are no\r\n\r\nlonger pro-worker socialists, progressives, arises out\r\n\r\nof  political differences, more immediately  over  the\r\n\r\nquestion of merger and Malaysia. It is because of that\r\n\r\nthat they have hit back at the Government through  the\r\n\r\nuse of the industrial weapon. The Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\ncommitted to fomenting strikes in order to further the\r\n\r\npolitical  aim  of the pro-Communists who  direct  the\r\n\r\nParty  and in accordance with the Communist technique.\r\n\r\nThe  immediate  political aim is to  halt  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Merger and Malaysia may  be  good  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, but it does not suit the immediate interest of\r\n\r\nthe Communists, and it must therefore be sabotaged and\r\n\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we accept the proposition that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the unionists who work for them are  open\r\n\r\nfront  Communist stooges, then the recent  tactics  in\r\n\r\nthe  field  of labour becomes clear and necessary.  We\r\n\r\ncan  see  why they are fomenting strikes  and  we  can\r\n\r\ndiscern  the techniques they use to trap workers  into\r\n\r\nunwittingly supporting Communist objectives.  What  is\r\n\r\nmost  interesting  is that the pro-Communists  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are not even able to apply Communist\r\n\r\ntechniques   or   manipulate  with   imagination   and\r\n\r\noriginality.  That is their tragedy.  These  Communist\r\n\r\nmanipulators    have    applied    these    techniques\r\n\r\nmechanically and blindly, and that is why  today  they\r\n\r\nare up to their necks in difficulty. These are the bar-room  Lenins  and  they  have the  mental  agility  of\r\n\r\ntrained parrots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine some of the recent antics of these\r\n\r\npocket  Lenins. One thing that has been made clear  by\r\n\r\nthe  speeches of my colleagues is that all the strikes\r\n\r\nled  by the Barisan Sosialis and the little Lenins  in\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. have political motivations: that is to bring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  the downfall of the Government and stop merger.\r\n\r\nYou  will  notice, Sir, that this political  objective\r\n\r\nwas  exemplified by the Member for Thomson who, up  to\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  a  long speech, came to  the  inevitable\r\n\r\nconclusion that the Government should resign  and  let\r\n\r\nus  have a national election. It is quite clear,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause the other tactics have failed. The use of  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  weapon  to bring down the  Government  has\r\n\r\nfailed   and,  therefore,  now  they  repeat,  \"Please\r\n\r\nresign; please resign.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no accident that this outburst of industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  started in July or August when the  Communists\r\n\r\ndiscovered  to  their horror that  merger  was  now  a\r\n\r\npractical  proposition. The little  Lenins,  with  and\r\n\r\nwithout beards, have since August been talking  boldly\r\n\r\nand  confidently of the October Revolution which  they\r\n\r\nhad  to  postpone  to November and  then  postpone  to\r\n\r\nDecember,   and   which  they   have   now   postponed\r\n\r\nindefinitely.  I  am  not denying  that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  whom they persuaded to go on strike may  have\r\n\r\ndone  so  because they had genuine economic grievances\r\n\r\nwhich  they  believed  that the pro-Communist  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  1eaders were out to resolve.  The  truth  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Communists were interested first  in\r\n\r\nthe  political objective, that is, to bring  down  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and only incidentally, or not at  all,  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic grievances of the workers. This fits  in\r\n\r\nwith  the  Leninist dogma that a good  Communist  must\r\n\r\nlook  upon  unions  primarily  as  the  tool  of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist Party. That is the basic tenet and belief of\r\n\r\nall  good Communists: that a good Communist must  look\r\n\r\nupon  unions as primarily a tool of the Party. Let  me\r\n\r\nquote from Lenin himself. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of bourgeois policy [that is, the policy\r\n\r\nof  non-Communist trade union leaders and so on] is to\r\n\r\nassist the economic struggle of the proletariat.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  what Lenin says. Non-Communist leaders  are\r\n\r\ninterested in assisting the economic struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of the Communist is to make the economic\r\n\r\nstruggle assist the Communist movement'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,    Sir,   Lenin   condemned   bourgeois   policy.\r\n\r\n\"Bourgeois\" is a term of abuse as far as the Communist\r\n\r\nis  concerned.  Bourgeois  policy,  he  said - the  non-Communist  unions - is  to  assist  the  worker  to  get\r\n\r\neconomic gain. The task of the Communists - the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis - I  am  translating for  their  clarification,\r\n\r\nSir - is  to  make  the  economic  struggle  assist  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  movement. If we examine many of the  things\r\n\r\nwhich  seem inexplicable in recent industrial activity\r\n\r\nhere,  we can understand why the Barisan Sosialis  are\r\n\r\ndoing  things  which, from the point of  view  of  the\r\n\r\nunionists  who  are  interested primarily  in  getting\r\n\r\nbenefits  for the workers, seem inexplicable,  because\r\n\r\nthe  Leninist technique says that the economic benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  workers is unimportant. It is secondary.  The\r\n\r\nprimary  objective is a political one, to  assist  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  movement. Yet again, Sir, there is  another\r\n\r\nquotation. This was something which was said by  Lenin\r\n\r\nin one of his less sober moments. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For a Communist, the economic struggles serve as a\r\n\r\nbase  for  the  organisation  of  the  workers  in   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary party, the consolidation and development\r\n\r\nof  their  class  in  the struggle against  the  whole\r\n\r\ncapitalist order.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what it means is that the economic struggle\r\n\r\nshould  be  used not to advance the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  but  to  help  in  the  organisation  of  the\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  worker  and in  the  consolidation  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  the  class  struggle   against   the\r\n\r\ncapitalist order. Again Lenin speaking:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If you regard the economic struggle as something\r\n\r\nself-sufficient   then  in   it   there   is   nothing\r\n\r\nsocialist.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  if you are only interested in the interest of the\r\n\r\nworker, then you are not a good socialist and you  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  good  Communist. You are not  a  good  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister name the source of\r\n\r\nthe quotation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is from a book called, \"Lenin\r\n\r\non  trade  unions\", which is an anthology  of  Lenin's\r\n\r\nwritings by Thomas Taylor Hemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to know\r\n\r\nwhether you can buy this book on the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member took the words out of my\r\n\r\nmouth. That is exactly what I was going to ask. It  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the book is easily available in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nLibrary, or the National Library or any other library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, not only is it available here,\r\n\r\nbut  I think it came to me through the courtesy of the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  Information Service. Moreover,  it  is\r\n\r\npublished  by the Columbia University Press.  My  only\r\n\r\nregret is that it has not been translated into Chinese\r\n\r\nso that the gentleman (the Member for Moulmein), whose\r\n\r\nconstituency I go to every fortnight, could share with\r\n\r\nme  some  of the delightful things that Lenin said  of\r\n\r\nhow the Barisan Sosialis should be conducted and, even\r\n\r\nmore  important,  how the Communist Party  should  use\r\n\r\nstooges without their knowing that they have been made\r\n\r\nstooges   of.  So  if  the  Member  for  Moulmein   is\r\n\r\ninterested, I could give him the address and he  could\r\n\r\nhave  a  look  at the copy without any fear  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs would ask  inquisitioning\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite clear from this book that a good\r\n\r\nCommunist  should  not be interested  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  interests  and improvements  are  concerned.\r\n\r\nThey  are  secondary.  The  most  important  thing  is\r\n\r\nwhether  it  promotes the Communist cause.  If  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  sacrifice the interests of  workers  to\r\n\r\npromote  the  Communist cause, then the  interests  of\r\n\r\nworkers must be sacrificed. If workers must suffer  to\r\n\r\npromote the Communist cause, then workers must suffer.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  good  Communist  technique.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have not denied that they are Communists. All\r\n\r\nthey have said is that it is a smear. That is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent  thing.  They  are therefore  following  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  strategy, but with this  difference,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nnot as intelligently and as imaginatively as Lenin did\r\n\r\nfor different circumstances. So, increasing the living\r\n\r\nstandard   of  workers  and  solving  their   economic\r\n\r\nproblems is only incidental at best to the major task,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  the  major  political  objective  of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  When  he meets a trade  dispute,  a  good\r\n\r\nCommunist  does  not  suffer by asking,  \"Is  there  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  economic grievance to be resolved?\"  That  is\r\n\r\nnot the first question he asks. A good Communist asks,\r\n\r\n\"How  can I exploit the economic grievance to  further\r\n\r\nthe Communist revolution?\" That is the first question.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  not  in  the  interest  of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nrevolution  to  resolve  the  economic  grievances  of\r\n\r\nworkers  and  to  win  them  more  money  and   better\r\n\r\nconditions,  then it is the duty of the  Communist  to\r\n\r\nsee that the conditions of workers grow worse in order\r\n\r\nto  increase their revolutionary ardour. That is again\r\n\r\npart of the essential dogma of a good Communist. If it\r\n\r\nis in the interest of Communism for workers to be both\r\n\r\ndiscontented and suffer more than necessary,  then  it\r\n\r\nis for the good Communist to create those conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I again quote from Lenin on trade unions. This\r\n\r\nis a quotation from him at page 108:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot and will not \"in every way\" promote the\r\n\r\nimprovement of the situation of workers under existing\r\n\r\nconditions.We struggle only for such an improvement of\r\n\r\nthe  situation  of the workers as will increase  their\r\n\r\nability to lead the class struggle,' -  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that  is  not to increase their standard  of  living.\r\n\r\n\"We  only fight for these things if they will increase\r\n\r\nthe ability to lead the class struggle.\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that is, under which an improvement of the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  not  connected  with  a  corruption  of\r\n\r\npolitical consciousness...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  a  Communist finds that by giving them  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard of living their political consciousness  will\r\n\r\nbe  corrupted, then a good Communist will say, \"Better\r\n\r\nkeep this. Do not improve their living standard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will again quote Lenin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We also struggle for reform but only in a Communist\r\n\r\nmanner,  only in a revolutionary manner do we struggle\r\n\r\nfor reform.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reducing all this Marxist jargon to simple\r\n\r\nlanguage, what Lenin is saying - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are a Leninist, are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> He is your God.

But one thing I have seen is that\r\n\r\nmany  gentlemen  who  claim to  be  evolutionists  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  floored  because the  Jesuits  read  books\r\n\r\nwhich they think they should not read. Similarly, Sir \r\n\r\n-  I am sorry the Member for Thomson has missed what I\r\n\r\nhave  said  earlier. One of the essentials of  a  good\r\n\r\nCommunist -  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - is to conceal his identity. The best\r\n\r\nway  to  conceal  his  identity  is  to  disclaim  any\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  Lenin. So to that extent,  Sir,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure the Member for Thomson that Lenin would be very\r\n\r\npleased to hear him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that he knows nothing about Lenin. We who are not\r\n\r\nLeninists  can  quote  Lenin freely  without  fear  or\r\n\r\nfavour  of being accused of being Leninists. I  notice\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Thomson did not accuse me of being\r\n\r\na  Leninist. He only thought it strange that I  should\r\n\r\nbe quoting the scriptures to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few more quotations coming which I\r\n\r\nthink  you  will find very interesting and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson will find very enlightening. Lenin himself\r\n\r\nenjoins a good Communist not to be interested  in  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of workers. That is secondary. The first thing\r\n\r\nis:  Is  it  useful  for  the  revolution?  If  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  keep the worker happy and contented  to\r\n\r\nfurther  the revolution, please do so. But  if  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to keep the workers depressed and miserable,\r\n\r\nplease  do  so.  That is the simple  approach  of  the\r\n\r\nLeninist.  So  what  Lenin  is  saying  is  that   the\r\n\r\nCommunist must riot fight to so improve the conditions\r\n\r\nof  workers that they are no longer dissatisfied  with\r\n\r\nthings.  That is the meaning of the earlier quotation.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it goes on to say that prolonged prosperity,\r\n\r\nprolonged   satisfaction,  to   quote   Lenin,   \"only\r\n\r\ndemoralises  the workers\". The Barisan  Sosialis  know\r\n\r\nthe  technique  and many of the things, starting  with\r\n\r\nFord factory and so on. You begin to see daylight.  Do\r\n\r\nnot  get the workers completely satisfied. Do not give\r\n\r\nhim everything he wants. If he is satisfied, he is not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  revolution.  In  ther  words,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\ndecrease in the misery of the workers hinders progress\r\n\r\ntowards  the revolution. The Communist theory is  that\r\n\r\nworkers  can never be happy and can never get  justice\r\n\r\nin any but a Communist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have noticed, Sir, that in many of their\r\n\r\nspeeches,  they  say you can never  solve  the  strike\r\n\r\nproblem in a capitalist society. You must go to  basic\r\n\r\ncauses. Again, what are the basic causes? How  do  you\r\n\r\nsolve it? I know, Sir, in the fatherland -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Au hon.

The truth is that we  agree  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  final solution to the  strike  problem.\r\n\r\nThere  will always be a conflict of interests  between\r\n\r\nthe worker and the employer, whether that employer  is\r\n\r\na  State or a private individual. We have a Government\r\n\r\nservice.  Technically we are a nationalised Government\r\n\r\nand  all  its  enterprises are  owned  by  the  people\r\n\r\ncollectively  and yet the workers go on  strike.  They\r\n\r\ncan   go  on  strike  in  a  non-Communist  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety. But in the kind of society that some  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis leaders have in mind, you cannot  go\r\n\r\non  strike.  Therefore,  there  are  no  strikes  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they solve the problem of strikes.  So  you\r\n\r\nsee,  Sir,  they  must work on that basis.  They  must\r\n\r\ndrive  home  the fact that in any except  a  Communist\r\n\r\nsociety  there  can be no solution to the  problem  of\r\n\r\nconflict between labour and capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You make a good Communist preacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  gets  extremely agitated  when  he  sees\r\n\r\nanother  non-Communist talking intelligent  Communism.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the Barisan Sosialis, as I have said,\r\n\r\nis  that  they  are tenderfoot Communists,  tenderfoot\r\n\r\nLeninists - [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a young schoolboy, one of my uncles (just\r\n\r\nto  stress  a point) gave me a chemical set and  said,\r\n\r\n\"If  you  take this little chemical and mix with  that\r\n\r\nchemical and light a fire, there will be a red  glow.\"\r\n\r\nBut  somehow something went wrong. There was not a red\r\n\r\nglow. There was a red explosion. That is precisely the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  which the second-class  Leninists  find\r\n\r\nthemselves today because they are applying a technique\r\n\r\nwhich is all right in Czarist Russia,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  you had a brutal government, where you  had  to\r\n\r\nwork  underground,  where Lenin said  because  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Russia,  it  was  necessary  for  every\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party to have a legal organisation  and  an\r\n\r\nillegal  organisation. You must have  an  organisation\r\n\r\nwhich  was  legal and another one which  was  illegal.\r\n\r\nThere is no Czarist Russia here, but still Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  are a legal  organisation  and\r\n\r\nsomebody else carries on an illegal organisation which\r\n\r\noperates  the  Barisan Sosialis. Therefore,  they  get\r\n\r\ninto  difficulties.  Therefore,  they  all  say,  \"No.\r\n\r\nCommunism  is a smear.\" We say, \"Well what  about  all\r\n\r\nthese  documents?\" \"Oh, that is a smear too.\" So,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, let us therefore go on to  explain  why\r\n\r\nthey  are  behaving in this way - the usual things  that\r\n\r\nthey  do.  First  they say they are fighting  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers - many of their workers wallop the workers. They\r\n\r\nsay  they  are  fighting to improve  the  lot  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers - lots  of  chaps  get unemployed.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand one of them was an unemployed member of the\r\n\r\nSingapore General Employees' Union who absconded  with\r\n\r\n$4,500. So these are the little difficulties that come\r\n\r\nabout when you operate a Leninist chemical set without\r\n\r\nexactly knowing the right formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the stresses laid is that a Leninist is\r\n\r\na   good  Communist.  A  good  Barisan  Sosialis  must\r\n\r\ndeliberately  create  strikes, violence  and  distress\r\n\r\namong  the  workers.  The point  has  been  repeatedly\r\n\r\nstressed by Lenin. Here again I' quote from \"Lenin  on\r\n\r\nUnions\", page 31, and this is what he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The spontaneous development of the labour movement\r\n\r\n[that  is,  in their jargon, \"spontaneous development\"\r\n\r\nmeans   unions   that  are  not  controlled   by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists;  anything that is not  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists becomes spontaneous development]  leads  to\r\n\r\nit becoming subordinated to bourgeois ideology.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What does it mean?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I will explain it later. Obviously\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson is a really good Leninist.  He\r\n\r\nnot only pretends that he does not know this gentleman\r\n\r\ncalled  Lenin hut he even pretends that  he  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand what it is all about. The Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomson  is a labour leader, a trade unionist who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  carrying out these operations, and yet he  says,\r\n\r\n\"I  do not know what it is all about.\" Anyway, Sir, as\r\n\r\nwe  go along, I am quite sure that not only will  this\r\n\r\nbecome  clear but I will also send him a  copy  of  my\r\n\r\nspeech at the expense of the Ministry of Culture. This\r\n\r\nis what Lenin said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The spontaneous development of the labour movement\r\n\r\nleads   to   it  becoming  subordinated  to  bourgeois\r\n\r\nideology  .for  the spontaneous labour movement  [that\r\n\r\nis,  a labour movement which is not controlled by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  or  by  the  Communists]  is  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  and  trade  unionism means  the  ideological\r\n\r\nenslavement of the workers to the bourgeoisie.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  trade  unions  which are not  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  is  an enslavement of the workers  to  the\r\n\r\nbourgeois  ideology. Sir, we begin to  understand  why\r\n\r\nany  unionist who is not associated with  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and pro-Communists becomes the oppressor  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  a  capitalist stooge, a running  dog - \r\n\r\nsorry, Sir, I am not applying this term to anybody  in\r\n\r\nthis House - because according to the Leninist technique\r\n\r\nany  trade union which is not under the control of the\r\n\r\nCommunists  becomes  mere  trade  unionism  and   must\r\n\r\neventually lead to the ideological enslavement of  the\r\n\r\nworkers to the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Hence our task [that is, the task of the Communists\r\n\r\nand the Barisan Sosialis] is to combat spontaneity, to\r\n\r\ndivert   the  labour  movement  from  its  spontaneous\r\n\r\nunionist   strivings  [that  is,  striving  for   pure\r\n\r\neconomic gain] to go under the wing of the bourgeoisie\r\n\r\nand  to  bring  it  under  the wing  of  revolutionary\r\n\r\nCommunism.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, it is the duty of any good Communist  when\r\n\r\nhe  sees  workers developing trade unions and fighting\r\n\r\nfor  better  wages and so on to condemn it  as  wrong.\r\n\r\nThat  means that we could improve our lot under a non-Communist society. Therefore we must divert  it  among\r\n\r\nother ends to create revolutionary Communism. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  is the task of the Communists to  organise\r\n\r\nand  use  trade unions not to improve the lot  of  the\r\n\r\nworker  but  to punish him through strikes  and  other\r\n\r\nforms of labour agitation that bear no hope for him in\r\n\r\nany  but  a  Communist society, and  that  in  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety  the lot of the worker must be an increase  in\r\n\r\nmisery, repression and continual strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to another aspect of the Communist\r\n\r\ntechnique - the role of strike in labour agitation.  The\r\n\r\nnon-Communist unionist's strike is a weapon  to  bring\r\n\r\npressure  on  employers  to get  concessions  for  the\r\n\r\nworker.  That  is how a non-Communist  trade  unionist\r\n\r\nsees the strike weapon. The strike weapon is something\r\n\r\nwhich he uses against employers to get concessions for\r\n\r\nthe  workers. But it is not so with the Communist. The\r\n\r\nwinning  of concession is only incidental  as  I  have\r\n\r\nshown,  Sir,  from  my earlier quotation.  By  winning\r\n\r\nconcessions  the Communists hope - this is  their  real\r\n\r\nobjective - to  enlist the support of  workers  for  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in their major political objective, because\r\n\r\nto  the Communists a strike is the training ground for\r\n\r\nrevolutionary violence, for building up  hatred  among\r\n\r\nthe workers against the Government, the police and all\r\n\r\ninstruments  associated  with  the  authority  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  That  is  the real political  objective  of  a\r\n\r\nstrike.  Now we can see why speaker after  speaker  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  spent a  great  deal  of  time\r\n\r\nelaborating on the violent brutality of the police. It\r\n\r\nis  necessary for them, through a strike, to create in\r\n\r\nthe  workers  who  are  not  politically  conscious  a\r\n\r\ndislike  and  hatred for the police and  for  all  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of  the  State.  Therefore,  this   becomes\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  training.  Now,  Sir,   we   begin   to\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say, \"We are not Communists. We\r\n\r\ndo not know what Communists are. That is a bogey.\" But\r\n\r\nwhether  they are or they are not, they are doing  the\r\n\r\nthings  that  a Communist should do, though  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing it badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me again quote Lenin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every strike concentrates all the attention and all\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  of  the workers first  on  one  then  on\r\n\r\nanother   evil  from  which  the  working   class   is\r\n\r\nsuffering.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  they  have  to tell  about  the  terrible\r\n\r\nGovernment, the terrible police and the sufferings  of\r\n\r\nthe workers. Lenin goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every strike gives rise to a discussion of these\r\n\r\nevils  and  helps  the workers to  appraise  them,  to\r\n\r\nunderstand when the oppression of the capitalist comes\r\n\r\nin.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the objective of a strike. Therefore, when  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  unionist  starts  a  strike,  he   is   not\r\n\r\ninterested in using the strike to settle a dispute but\r\n\r\nto  instil  revolutionary  fervour  and  revolutionary\r\n\r\nhatred  for  the State, the Government and the  police\r\n\r\namong the workers. That is the objective. You can  see\r\n\r\nwhy  strikes are prolonged when they could be settled.\r\n\r\nWhy  is it necessary to create scuffles and why is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to put up banners charging the State and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  being  brutal and oppressive?  Because\r\n\r\nthat is the real objective of a strike weapon - to build\r\n\r\nup revolutionary fervour and hatred among the workers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Lenin further enjoined the Communists, and  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to use every strike, every manifestation of\r\n\r\neconomic  oppression    for the widest  socialist  and\r\n\r\nrevolutionary propaganda.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is the objective again. He did not say, to  use\r\n\r\nevery   strike  to  cow  the  capitalist  into  making\r\n\r\nconcessions. He said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`...to use every strike, every manifestation of\r\n\r\neconomic  oppression  .for the  widest  socialist  and\r\n\r\nrevolutionary propaganda.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He further declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All sundry manifestations of police tyranny [I think\r\n\r\nthat  strikes a chord in the .Member for Thomson]  and\r\n\r\nautocratic  outrage, besides the evils connected  with\r\n\r\nthe economic struggle are equally widely applicable as\r\n\r\na means of drawing in the masses.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You  must  use  strikes to instil in  the  workers  a\r\n\r\nhatred  for the police, the Government and so on,  but\r\n\r\nnot  to  settle disputes with the employers.  That  is\r\n\r\nincidental.  If  you decide on anything,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nsuitable.  These are roughly the agitating  techniques\r\n\r\nrecommended  in the Communist manuals  and  which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis - being  only second-class  Leninists - carry  out  with  ineptitude. This accounts  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  air of depression that occasionally  descends\r\n\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are a first-class Leninist, are you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, if we analyse some of the\r\n\r\ntechniques used by the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nin  the strikes they organised in Singapore, you  will\r\n\r\ndiscover - I   am  sorry  that  I  said   \"second-class\r\n\r\nLeninists\"; I withdraw the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterm-that it was the third-class Leninists who  tried\r\n\r\nto apply these techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Why do you not pass me some of those\r\n\r\nbooks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, I think the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nwas  not  here because his colleague, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein, was most interested and most agitated as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  he  can get a copy of this \"Lenin on  Unions\"\r\n\r\nand  whether it is all right, and I have given him  an\r\n\r\nassurance that it is all right because I got it myself\r\n\r\nfrom the U.S.I.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You should have borrowed it from Mao Tse-tung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> And it is published by one of the\r\n\r\nrespectable   Universities  the  Columbia   University\r\n\r\nPress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Where is it sold?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not sold.

They  have  a  propensity  to  follow   the\r\n\r\nCommunist   manuals  mechanically,  hut  we   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  fortunate in that we  can  anticipate\r\n\r\nwhat they will do in a given situation. This is how, I\r\n\r\nam  told, big game-hunters trap animals. Knowing their\r\n\r\npropensities  and  weaknesses under given  conditions,\r\n\r\nthey are then trapped accordingly.

The Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nis  becoming  increasingly agitated as  to  why  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting  Lenin,  my reading Lenin and what  particular\r\n\r\nbook of Lenin I am reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is quite clear that he has an inkling that we  are\r\n\r\nalways  anticipating  his or his Party's  moves  many,\r\n\r\nmany weeks before they actually begin to move and,  to\r\n\r\nthat  extent, they have been getting into greater  and\r\n\r\ngreater difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not agitated. I am just trying to\r\n\r\nfollow you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Therefore, Sir, I do not want to go\r\n\r\nfurther  and anticipate things to come for the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, because we can see not only weeks ahead  but\r\n\r\nmonths  ahead.  But  if they look a  little  bit  less\r\n\r\nbuoyant  and  a little more bewildered it  is  because\r\n\r\nthings  have not quite worked out as the good Leninist\r\n\r\nbook said it would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why the Barisan Sosialis started these\r\n\r\nstrikes.  They  were  political  strikes  intended  to\r\n\r\nthwart merger. Well, they have not thwarted merger and\r\n\r\nthere  were  a lot of strikes on their hands - strikes,\r\n\r\nas  it were, all dressed up and no place to go. But if\r\n\r\nthe  little Lenins, with or without whiskers, had read\r\n\r\nLenin  properly,  they  would have  learnt  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  start  a revolution unless the  conditions  as\r\n\r\nlaid down by Lenin for a revolution are right. Anyway,\r\n\r\nit  is  not my purpose to teach little Lenins  how  to\r\n\r\nsuck  eggs because I am quite sure they too  can  read\r\n\r\nLenin in their own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know why the Barisan Sosialis leaders have\r\n\r\nrefused  to  have things like social security  schemes\r\n\r\nand  proper wage scales; to settle strikes peacefully,\r\n\r\nto   use   the   conciliation  machinery,  arbitration\r\n\r\nprocedure, and so on. My quotation earlier has made it\r\n\r\nquite  clear. Lenin said that the first thing you  ask\r\n\r\nis  not  how  to  solve the economic problems  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  but  how to use their economic grievances  to\r\n\r\nfurther   the  revolution.  These  are  two  different\r\n\r\napproaches to the labour problems, and that is why  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of Singapore there are what they  call  the\r\n\r\nconditions  for  a revolution but these  are  not  yet\r\n\r\nripe. They would not start a revolution or attempt  to\r\n\r\nstart  a  revolution,  and the whole  thing  has  gone\r\n\r\nhaywire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know now why the Barisan Sosialis have been\r\n\r\ntrying to precipitate clashes between strikers and the\r\n\r\npolice: why they have been trying to build a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmyth of police violence and intimidation of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know why, as in the case of the Ford and\r\n\r\nShaw   strikes,   they  have  refused   to   use   the\r\n\r\nconciliation  machinery [Interruption].

If workers  can\r\n\r\nbe  maimed and suffer loss of lives, then they can  be\r\n\r\nmobilised  for  a  revolutionary  overthrow  of   non-Communist  leaders.  And that  has  been  the  purpose\r\n\r\nduring  the last nine months - to provoke the Government\r\n\r\ninto  staging  clashes with the police  so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  get martyrs. If you will remember, Sir,  during\r\n\r\nthe  Hock Lee riots when I was with a newspaper, there\r\n\r\nwere  clashes between students and the police where  a\r\n\r\nyouth  was  badly  injured,  in  fact,  almost  dying.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  taking him to the hospital,  a  group  of\r\n\r\nthem, who obviously were trying to make Capital out of\r\n\r\nthe  incident,  carried the body of the dying  student\r\n\r\nall  the way to one of the Chinese newspapers here and\r\n\r\nthe  boy died. They had a martyr. The next day at  the\r\n\r\nbig  funeral, I think the then Chief Minister, who  is\r\n\r\nnow the Member for Anson, sent a big wreath,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  as an act of demonstration they pulled the wreath\r\n\r\naside.  But  they  had  a  martyr,  a  dead  boy,  and\r\n\r\nthroughout the last nine months the Communists who run\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis have been  trying  to  get  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide them with martyrs.  The  latest\r\n\r\ndisappointment  and the greatest  anger  that  we  are\r\n\r\ncausing  them, so far as we are concerned, is that  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  provided them with martyrs and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  leaders or the strong-arm  men  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis have been trying to  create  martyrs\r\n\r\namong  other  workers  who  have  been  annoying   and\r\n\r\nintimidating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we also know why the Barisan Sosialis leaders\r\n\r\ndeliberately led Ford workers into a strike where they\r\n\r\ngot  the  worst  of the bargain. It  was  a  political\r\n\r\nstrike which they bungled. The workers lost more  than\r\n\r\nthey  were likely to gain. Maybe the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncan   divert   the  resentment  of  the   workers   by\r\n\r\nsuggesting,  \"Well, even if you had a bad bargain,  it\r\n\r\nis not the fault of the Barisan Sosialis. Here we have\r\n\r\nthe oppressors of the poor, the capitalists, and a bad\r\n\r\nGovernment.\" Just to leave some resentment.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nby  the time this debate is over, the whole thing will\r\n\r\nbe  twisted as, \"There you are. This proves that in  a\r\n\r\nnon-Communist society, there can be no justice for the\r\n\r\nworkers.\"  Therefore, it is necessary in  every  trade\r\n\r\ndispute    to    leave   behind   some   measure    of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction to convince the workers that there can\r\n\r\nbe  no  workers' paradise except as laid down  in  the\r\n\r\ngood  book and, as you are likely to find in Communist\r\n\r\ncountries,  where there are no strikes  because  there\r\n\r\ncannot be any strikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Is something wrong with you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> However, let me tell the Leninist\r\n\r\ntenderfoots  in the Barisan Sosialis that the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  are  not  all that  dumb,  nor  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  all that dumb.

They   are   becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly    resentful   of   the   violence    and\r\n\r\nintimidation  that the desperate men  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis'  S.A.T.U. have been forced  to  use  against\r\n\r\nworkers,  of  the loss of employment  to  hundreds  of\r\n\r\npeople  by ineptly handled labour disputes, by  forced\r\n\r\ncollections  to finance strikes which  have  got  them\r\n\r\nnowhere. People are also becoming aware that the  real\r\n\r\nobjective of the desperate Communists is not to better\r\n\r\nthe  life  of the workers but to make life  worse  for\r\n\r\nthem  so  as to mount a revolution on the misery  they\r\n\r\nhave   created.  The  Communists  hope  to   frustrate\r\n\r\nindustrial  development  and expansion  because  these\r\n\r\nwould enable the non-Communist Government to provide a\r\n\r\nbetter   life  for  the  workers  in  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nsociety.  The increasing resistance the Communists  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are meeting from the workers  is\r\n\r\nproof that the Barisan's one star - there is only  one\r\n\r\nstar - is on the wane. The day is not far off  when  it\r\n\r\nis more likely that the Barisan Sosialis Members would\r\n\r\nbe  seeing  stars than to be holding their star  aloft\r\n\r\nand leading it towards victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\noriginally I did not intend to speak on this question,\r\n\r\nbut  as one who has worked in a union as a responsible\r\n\r\nofficial, and as one who has worked with the  workers,\r\n\r\nand  since the Government intend to amend this motion - the  amendment proposed by the Government  is  very\r\n\r\nmalicious - I am therefore compelled to say something\r\n\r\non this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government attribute all the industrial unrest\r\n\r\nto  those unions which are not going to toe the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nline  and  which are branded as pro-Communist  unions.\r\n\r\nThe  Government say all this industrial unrest is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of pro-Communist union activities in order  to\r\n\r\ndestroy those unions which do not kowtow to the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Through  this  amendment  the  Government\r\n\r\nintend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto deal with those unions which are really working for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the workers. There are many reasons for\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest. For example, political instability\r\n\r\nis  one.  So to put the blame of industrial unrest  on\r\n\r\nthe  Communists is not fair. The Government intend  to\r\n\r\nmake  use of this tactic to create the impression that\r\n\r\nall  these troubles are agitated by the Communists and\r\n\r\nthey  should  be responsible for it. But in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  Party is an illegal Party.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Communists are not able to defend themselves.  So\r\n\r\nthe Government intend to shirk their responsibility by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  all these troubles are  created  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in order to divert the people's  attention\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government's failure, and to cover  up  many\r\n\r\nbad  things which they have done. The Government  hope\r\n\r\nto  convince  the people that all these troubles  have\r\n\r\nbeen  created by the Communists. The Communist  Party,\r\n\r\nbeing  an  illegal Party, could not come out into  the\r\n\r\nopen  to  defend itself. In the past the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  accused  certain  people  of   being\r\n\r\nCommunists.  So now you do not have to  laugh  at  it.\r\n\r\nThis  is proof that what I say is true. The day before\r\n\r\nyesterday, the Member for Anson in this Assembly  also\r\n\r\ntouched on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain speakers said that strikes had also taken\r\n\r\nplace  in  non-Communist countries. But  here  we  can\r\n\r\nquote  something  from  the P.A.P. speeches  made  by\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers.  The Minister for  Health  and  Law\r\n\r\nperhaps  was somewhat honest in saying those words.  I\r\n\r\nam  now  quoting from the Sin Chew Jit  Poh  of  today\r\n\r\n(local page 5). The Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Industrial unrest was not peculiar to Singapore. It\r\n\r\nwas  a  feature of industrialised countries throughout\r\n\r\nthe world. In England, civil servants, the traditional\r\n\r\nmoderates  in  trade unionism, were now in  the  front\r\n\r\nline  of  an  industrial battle because the Government\r\n\r\nhad   rejected  wage  claims  to  offset  inflationary\r\n\r\npressures and adverse balance of payments.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was said by the Minister for Health and Law.  He\r\n\r\nalso  knows  something about labour problems.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen working with him, so I know he is somewhat like a\r\n\r\ngreat  man, and I know that it was uttered in  honesty\r\n\r\nand sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo   it  is  unfair  for  the  P.A.P. to  say   that\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest  is  all the  result  of  Communist\r\n\r\nagitation.  We  cannot say that as long  as  there  is\r\n\r\nindustrial  unrest  whipped up by  non-P.A.P. unions,\r\n\r\nthese people must all be Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present issue is very clear. It is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  indifferent to the  establishment  of\r\n\r\nindustrial peace. What they are actually interested in\r\n\r\nis  how  they  can  deal  with such  people  as  their\r\n\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a few days back, the Government brought\r\n\r\nup  the National Referendum Bill and talked about  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes  which were in support of the Government,\r\n\r\nsaying  that those votes, even with the drawing  of  a\r\n\r\ntortoise  On  them were also votes for the Government.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to say, they want all things that are  good.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the claims of A.U.P.E., the union of the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Culture,\r\n\r\nare good. They are all right. So A.U.P.E. can go ahead\r\n\r\nand  carry on, because he himself is the leader of the\r\n\r\nunion.   You  just  cannot  say  that  this  is   also\r\n\r\nCommunist.  You  will make yourself a  laughing-stock.\r\n\r\nFor example, regarding the vote with the drawing of  a\r\n\r\ntortoise  on it, you say, \"If you do not  want  it,  I\r\n\r\nwant it myself.\" If you want a turtle drawn on a blank\r\n\r\nvote, then the vote will go to the Government as well.\r\n\r\nBut  all the bad things, such as strikes not conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. members or P.A.P. union leaders,  must\r\n\r\nhave  been done by the Communists. All the strikes  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.-led unions will always result  in  success\r\n\r\nand  wage  increases.  That  is  to  say,  on  certain\r\n\r\nconditions;  if you get some benefit out of  the  wage\r\n\r\nincrease,  you  must  make some  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nunions.  That is the condition imposed by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions.  All those which do not belong to  this  group\r\n\r\nmust be Communists. That is their argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the present P.A.P. Government are\r\n\r\nvery  clever  at playing tricks. They are  trying  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  means to prolong their political  life.  So\r\n\r\nthey  will  use all means to smear all the others  who\r\n\r\nare   against  the  P.A.P.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  know full well that there are many  unions\r\n\r\nwhich are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupporting  the P.A.P. Government. In  order  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  such  unions,  the  Government  hope  to  create\r\n\r\nconfusion and  to give them trouble. It is the aim  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to be successful in this  manner,  but\r\n\r\nthey  just  cannot succeed. For example, the  one-time\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Government had various  experiences  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with unions which were opposed to them.  That\r\n\r\nis,  they  tried  to put all the blame  of  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest on the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I am trying to say is that\r\n\r\nunion  leaders  do  not  resort to  industrial  action\r\n\r\nunnecessarily, because if they do, then they will only\r\n\r\nbe giving the Government an opportunity to smear them.\r\n\r\nThe Government are supporting all the P.A.P.-dominated\r\n\r\nunions  at  the expense of the non-P.A.P. unions.  In\r\n\r\nthis  manner, the P.A.P. hope that they can hand  over\r\n\r\nthe  true  unionists  into the hands  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  after  their phoney merger.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to tell my friends in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  smears, compulsion and oppression  will  be  met\r\n\r\nwith greater resistance. We can see clearly that since\r\n\r\n1958  there have been many people who have been trying\r\n\r\nto  work  for  the interest of the workers  hut  these\r\n\r\npeople  have  either been branded communists  or  pro-Communist   \r\n\r\ncadres.   Because  of   this   smear   and\r\n\r\nallegation, many people have been put into gaol.  Even\r\n\r\nthose  who are truly fighting for the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  still  remaining in gaol.  These  people\r\n\r\nnumber  about  20. Many unions have been  closed  down\r\n\r\nbecause of the Communist label. In spite of all  this,\r\n\r\nthe  people and the workers are not afraid. The  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement is going on all the same. We  can  see\r\n\r\nfrom this that to go through the process of oppression\r\n\r\nand smear is useless. It is futile to do this thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, everybody knows that to get\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore, we must not only  have \r\n\r\nthe co-operation of the workers themselves but we must \r\n\r\nalso  get  co-operation from other parties  concerned. \r\n\r\nOnly  with  this co-operation can there be   industrial \r\n\r\npeace and industrial  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in Singapore. If there are fewer  strikes\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  the capitalists will,  of  course,  be\r\n\r\nhappier.   But   the  question  of   whether   foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists will come to invest in Singapore does  not\r\n\r\nsolely  depend on the number of strikes in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  main  thing  will be whether there  is  political\r\n\r\nstability in Singapore. If the political situation  is\r\n\r\nnot  certain,  then foreign capitalists will  hesitate\r\n\r\nbefore  they  come  to invest in  Singapore.  But  the\r\n\r\npresent  P.A.P.  Government  are  not  trying  to   do\r\n\r\nanything  about  the creation of political  stability.\r\n\r\nInstead  they  talk  of Communists  everywhere.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult   of  this  cry  of  Communism,  everybody   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  seems  to be suffering from  the  Communist\r\n\r\nphobia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now we have seen how the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\ntalked a great deal about Leninism and Communism: this\r\n\r\nis  Communist and that is Communist, and everything is\r\n\r\nCommunist.  According to the arguments put forward  by\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.,   you  have  Communists  everywhere   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. They seem to say that Singapore has  become\r\n\r\na  Communist State. Now this behaviour of theirs  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  induce foreign investors  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. In fact, it will frighten them away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us say you are a foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalist, with the intention to invest in  Singapore\r\n\r\nby  setting  up  factories.  But  when  you  hear  the\r\n\r\nGovernment shouting Communists here, Communists there,\r\n\r\nand  that all the unions are Communist-dominated,  and\r\n\r\nyou  think of the necessity of getting workers to work\r\n\r\nin  your  factories, you will think twice  before  you\r\n\r\ncome to invest in Singapore. There are so many workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore under so many unions, but they say  that\r\n\r\nonly  those unions under the leadership of  Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair and Mr Kandasamy are non-Communist. How can  you\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  so  many unions in  Singapore  are  all\r\n\r\nCommunist and only those under these persons are  non-Communist?  So  because  of  this  cry  of  Communism,\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  dare to come and invest in Singapore, and because\r\n\r\nof   the  absence  of  investment  in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will put the blame on the  Communists  and\r\n\r\nsay  it  is all because of the Communists that foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  have been frightened away.  In  fact,  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  are  guilty  of frightening  away  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.  The Government themselves have  to  admit\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  guilty  of frightening  away  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment, and not the Communists. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  are now branding all  the  non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions  as Communist unions. But this tactic of theirs\r\n\r\nwill not frighten the workers of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been the question of a Common Market\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation. In the course of\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  the  Government of  Singapore  have  been\r\n\r\nnegotiating  with  the Federation  Government  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of a Common Market, but so far there has been\r\n\r\nno  result.  So  we  will say that before  the  Common\r\n\r\nMarket can come into existence, this Common Market  is\r\n\r\nalso one of the factors that have to be considered  by\r\n\r\nforeign  investors because they are not  sure  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  going  to  be  any  Common  Market  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya. From  this  we\r\n\r\ncan  see that the question of a Common Market has been\r\n\r\ntalked  about for over two years without any  success.\r\n\r\nIn  spite of all this, the P.A.P. Government  keep  on\r\n\r\nbragging about merger and the benefits they can derive\r\n\r\ntherefrom.  How  can you say that  merger  will  bring\r\n\r\ngreat  benefits  to the people of Singapore  when  the\r\n\r\nsimple  question of a Common Market cannot be  solved?\r\n\r\nFrom  my personal point of view, the people are  quite\r\n\r\nright  in saying that the P.A.P. are selling out their\r\n\r\ninterests by merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been a worker myself and,\r\n\r\nas  a  worker, I am not in a position to talk a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  like  the Prime Minister who can argue,  by  all\r\n\r\nsorts   of   reasoning,  that  Federal  citizens   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  are the  same  and  that  Federal\r\n\r\nnationality -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I was just drawing  a\r\n\r\nsort  of analogy from the question of merger but I  am\r\n\r\nleaving  it at that now. What I was trying to  say  is\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  worker,  I am not  able  to  speak  with\r\n\r\neloquence like the Minister for Culture who brings  .a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of arguments into h-is speech so  that  he\r\n\r\ncan  turn black into white. I very much appreciate his\r\n\r\nintelligence  in being able to do such  a  thing.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  will  say  here  is that,  from  my  personal\r\n\r\nexperience,  the present P.A.P. are only  putting  the\r\n\r\nwhole  blame  of  industrial unrest on  the  so-called\r\n\r\nCommunist  and pro-Communist unions. I will  say  that\r\n\r\nthis attitude of the P.A.P. is really ridiculous.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  believe that not everybody  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  as clever and intelligent as the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture and the Minister for Finance. Many people\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. still have a sense of righteousness, and\r\n\r\nI  believe  there  will  come a  day  when  they  will\r\n\r\ndiscover  this  kind of people in the  P.A.P. itself.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, at the present moment, some people  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are  being misled by a few  leaders  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that all the strikes have been agitated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communist and the pro-Communist elements. But one\r\n\r\nday  they  will come to discover that they  have  been\r\n\r\nmisled  by  their  leaders  into  believing  so.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  former Labour Minister said,  with  all\r\n\r\nsincerity, that there were strikes everywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  and they were not peculiar to Singapore  alone.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, I will say he is really a man of good\r\n\r\nconscience -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is true I have said that, but I have\r\n\r\nsaid very much more than that also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. I agree that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said something about other  things  too,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  quite  appreciative of  his  arguments.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the workers will discover in due course  that\r\n\r\nthe  minority leadership of the P.A.P. will  gradually\r\n\r\nresort  to  the tactics employed by the Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and the people will discover  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  for  what  they are.  If  there  are  some\r\n\r\nworkers  with  a  sense  of righteousness,  they  will\r\n\r\nawaken  to  the fact that the present Government  will\r\n\r\nfall,  as the Lim Yew Hock Government did fall,  in  a\r\n\r\nvery dishonourable manner. It is not a question of our\r\n\r\nremaining  in  office as Members of the Assembly.  The\r\n\r\nmain  thing  is that after our term of office  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, we  can go about everywhere  with  a  clear\r\n\r\nconscience and get the applause and the support of the\r\n\r\npeople, instead of getting criticism from them. But if\r\n\r\nthese  leaders  were to go and meet  the  people,  the\r\n\r\npeople would say, \"Oh, these are the people who at one\r\n\r\ntime  sent my husband and my children to gaol.\"  Under\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances, some of the P.A.P. leaders  will\r\n\r\nnot discover the wrong they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell Members of this House that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not take advantage of this amendment\r\n\r\nand this motion against the interests of the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore. If they do, then the days of the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nnumbered. In fact, if the P.A.P. should take advantage\r\n\r\nof  this  motion to deal with the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  they  will be doomed. The P.A.P. must  not  say,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  since there are people jumping into the  sea  to\r\n\r\ncommit suicide, we must follow them as well.\" If  they\r\n\r\npersist in this way, they will perish in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

He also expresses profound sympathy\r\n\r\nfor  the workers. Sir, perhaps the House is not  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Cairnhill was the President  of\r\n\r\nthe Clerical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Administrative  Workers Union,  the  trustees  of\r\n\r\nwhich  were Mr G. H. Kiat, the proprietor  of  G.  H.\r\n\r\nKiat  and Company, a capitalist and an adviser to  the\r\n\r\nChung  Khiaw  Bank,  and  Mr  Lim  Chuan  Geok,   the\r\n\r\nproprietor   of   a   firm  of  auctioneers,   another\r\n\r\ncapitalist.  The  activities  that  went  on  in   the\r\n\r\nClerical   and  Administrative  Workers   Union   were\r\n\r\nconfined to mahjong, jackpot, skittles and card games.\r\n\r\nIndeed.  Sir, the Member for Cairnhill should  preface\r\n\r\nhis  remarks by saying that he was the president of  a\r\n\r\ngambling den and not a trade unionist. But his remarks\r\n\r\ndo  not  bear  sufficient importance. The workers  now\r\n\r\nhave  no faith in him, and they do not have any regard\r\n\r\nfor what he says on these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Barisan Sosialis is another matter. The\r\n\r\nMember for Upper Serangoon yesterday stated that there\r\n\r\nwere strikes in the U.S.A., the U.K. and India. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  deny  that  at  all. Indeed  that  was  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health and Law stated. But we  also  say\r\n\r\nthat the only countries where there are no strikes are\r\n\r\nthe  Communist and Fascist countries like  China,  the\r\n\r\nU.S.S.R. and Portugal. The Member for Upper Serangoon\r\n\r\nfurther said that Government Members claimed that  all\r\n\r\nstrikes were Communist inspired. He argued that  since\r\n\r\nGovernment Members had said that, and those  were  his\r\n\r\nwords,  therefore, the strikes called by the A.U.P.E.,\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  Employees' Union, the Singapore Manual  and\r\n\r\nMercantile   Workers'  Union,  were   also   Communist\r\n\r\ninspired.  Either the Member for Upper  Serangoon  was\r\n\r\nnot   listening   attentively  to  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour,  or  he  was\r\n\r\ndeliberately    misrepresenting   the    facts.    The\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary reported that there  were  69\r\n\r\nstrikes  which were called by the Communist-controlled\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, and 24 strikes were called by the  non-Communist  unions. It is true that the  A.U.P.E.,  the\r\n\r\nBank  Employees' Union and the Manual  and  Mercantile\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union have called strikes. But these  unions\r\n\r\nwere  also  willing  to  accept  arbitration  in   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court. That is the difference,\r\n\r\nSir. The Communist-controlled unions, however,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways avoid arbitration unless they are compelled  to\r\n\r\ngo to arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain in detail two strikes called by the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions in order to illustrate how  the  pro-Communist  trade  unionists  ruthlessly  exploit   the\r\n\r\nworkers to mount up discontent and tension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore General Employees Union called out the\r\n\r\nworkers  in Shaw's cinemas on strike in support  of  a\r\n\r\nclaim for arrears of overtime. The strike lasted  from\r\n\r\n21st December, 1961, to 1st February, 1962 - a total  of\r\n\r\n33 days. 419 workers were involved and 14,036 man-days\r\n\r\nwere lost as a result of the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for Labour recommended that the\r\n\r\ndispute  be  referred to the Labour Court. The  Labour\r\n\r\nCourt   is  the  machinery  provided  in  the   Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance to adjudicate upon matters involving  rights\r\n\r\nprovided by the labour legislation. Many other  unions\r\n\r\nhave  appeared in the Labour Court and they  have  had\r\n\r\narrears of overtime amounting to thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nBut  the Singapore General Employees Union refused  to\r\n\r\nrefer the matter to the Labour Court. At the end of 33\r\n\r\ndays  of  strike, when the workers had lost  33  days'\r\n\r\nwages,  the  dispute  has now  been  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson and the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang spoke on the Ford strike, but they always kept on\r\n\r\nsaying   how   successful  the  union   was   in   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations and that it had obtained - according to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson - 52 cents per  day  increase,  42\u00bd\r\n\r\nhours per week and a five-day week. Anyone who did not\r\n\r\nknow the background would have been impressed by this.\r\n\r\nLet me explain to the House what really happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Motor Workshops Employees Union, one\r\n\r\nof  the  unions of the S.A.T.U. group, called out  the\r\n\r\nindustrial workers of the Ford Motor Company on strike\r\n\r\non 21st November, 1961. Though the strike may have had\r\n\r\nlegitimate  economic grievances, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncommissars  had intended this strike as a  prelude  to\r\n\r\nthe   November   revolution  which   they   had   been\r\n\r\nproclaiming in order to bring down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government. The strike lasted 110  days  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers  resumed work on 10th March, 1962. Before  the\r\n\r\nstrike took place, the union did not make any specific\r\n\r\nclaims regarding wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the strike, the company offered to increase\r\n\r\nthe  hourly wages from 88 cents per hour to  93  cents\r\n\r\nper hour for 1962, an increase of 5 cents per hour per\r\n\r\nman  in  1962  and it also offered to increase  to  98\r\n\r\ncents  per hour, an increase of 5 cents per  hour  per\r\n\r\nman in 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this, to one who is not familiar with trade\r\n\r\nunion negotiations, may sound a bit confusing. Perhaps\r\n\r\nI  had  better  explain this in  greater  detail.  The\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers, on an average, were receiving  88\r\n\r\ncents  per  hour.  The  Ford Company  is  an  American\r\n\r\ncompany  which  employs all hourly-rated  people.  The\r\n\r\nCompany before the strike offered an increase of  five\r\n\r\ncents  per man per hour for 1962 and another  increase\r\n\r\nof  five  cents per hour per man for 1963.  The  union\r\n\r\nrefused  and  the workers were out on strike  for  110\r\n\r\ndays.  During the 110-day strike, each worker lost  an\r\n\r\naverage  of $7.90 per day and a total of $576 for  the\r\n\r\nwhole  period of the strike, that is, 73 working days.\r\n\r\nThough  the  strike lasted 110 days, the working  days\r\n\r\nwere 73 days and the total wages lost amounted to $576\r\n\r\nper  man. By this time the Barisan Sosialis commissars\r\n\r\nhad   come  to  the  conclusion  that  their  November\r\n\r\nrevolution had turned out to be a flop and  there  was\r\n\r\nno  point in continuing the Ford strike; so they spent\r\n\r\nsome anxious moments begging the employers to come  to\r\n\r\nany  settlement  because  many  workers  had  come  to\r\n\r\nrealise  by then that they had been made dupes  of  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis political agitators.  After  110\r\n\r\ndays of strike, the union agreed on an increase of six\r\n\r\ncents per hour. This is the increase of six cents  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa Chu Kang and the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\ntried  to  explain as a victory! Sir, let  me  repeat:\r\n\r\nbefore the strike, the company had already offered  an\r\n\r\nincrease of five cents. At the end of the strike,  the\r\n\r\nunion agreed on six cents. They have been telling  the\r\n\r\nworkers that they got this increase of six cents after\r\n\r\n110 days of strike. What this really means in terms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  hard  cash  is that after 110 days of  strike  the\r\n\r\nunion  has  obtained one cent increase per worker  per\r\n\r\nhour.  With  this  one  cent increase  over  what  was\r\n\r\noffered  before the strike, each worker will  have  to\r\n\r\nwork  five  days a week for 28 years  before  he  can\r\n\r\nrecoup  the $576 that he has lost in wages during  the\r\n\r\nstrike.  He will have to work for 28 years  before  he\r\n\r\ncan  make up the lost wages. This is the great victory\r\n\r\nof  the  Ford Motor Workshop Union - General  Secretary,\r\n\r\nMr  Low Pen; negotiator, Mr Fong Swee Suan! By  that\r\n\r\ntime, the General Secretary of the union, Mr Low Pen,\r\n\r\nand  the gentleman who negotiated this agreement,  Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan,  a  leading member  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, will be comfortably earning old age  pension\r\n\r\nfrom    the    Government - no   doubt   a    democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment - while the workers will still be  struggling\r\n\r\nto make up the losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the strike, the workers were receiving an\r\n\r\nannual  bonus of 20 working days' wages subject  to  a\r\n\r\ndeduction  of about ten per cent of a day's  wage  for\r\n\r\nevery  day of unauthorised absence. I notice that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson did not touch on the  subject  of\r\n\r\nbonus.  The  company  offered to  increase  it  to  30\r\n\r\nworking  days'  wages subject to a  deduction  of  two\r\n\r\ndays' wages for every (lay of unauthorised absence. In\r\n\r\nother   words,   if  a  worker  was  not   guilty   of\r\n\r\nabsenteeism - he could be on sick leave or  on  vacation\r\n\r\nbut not unauthorised absence - during the year, he would\r\n\r\nhave  received  under the company's offer  30  working\r\n\r\ndays'  wages  as  bonus. This was offered  before  the\r\n\r\nstrike. The union - one of the principal unions of  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group - led by Messrs. Fong Swee Suan  and  Low\r\n\r\nPeng refused this. After 110 days of strike, the union\r\n\r\nagreed  to  an annual bonus of 24 working days'  wages\r\n\r\nsubject to a deduction of ten per cent of a day's wage\r\n\r\nfor  every  day  of  unauthorised absence.  What  this\r\n\r\nreally  amounted to was that after 110 days of strike,\r\n\r\nthey  lost  six days of what the company  had  already\r\n\r\noffered,  which  was  a  ten-day  increase,  and  they\r\n\r\nobtained four days. In other words, before the strike,\r\n\r\nthe workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  getting  20 working days' wages as bonus.  After\r\n\r\n110  days of strike, the union reached an agreement - we\r\n\r\nare  told a very successful agreement - of a four  days'\r\n\r\nbonus.  As I have said earlier, Sir, each worker  lost\r\n\r\nabout  $576  in  wages. He has now gained  four  days'\r\n\r\nwages as additional bonus. Putting it in another form,\r\n\r\neach  worker  will  have to work 18 years  before  his\r\n\r\nadditional bonus of four days' wages makes up for  the\r\n\r\nloss  he has suffered. This is the great victory, Sir!\r\n\r\nThe  victory is that the worker will have to  work  18\r\n\r\nyears before he can make up the loss he has suffered!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain the increase of one cent and four days'\r\n\r\nwages  as  bonus, the union has accepted the company's\r\n\r\n\"Personal  Conduct  Rules\" as part of  the  agreement.\r\n\r\nThis was not mentioned by the Member for Thomson. This\r\n\r\nis  very  interesting.  There are  27  rules  and  any\r\n\r\nemployee  committing  any of these  offences  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  disciplinary  action  even  amounting  to\r\n\r\ndismissal.  No  other  union  in  Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\nsubject  to  such  conditions and this  is  the  great\r\n\r\nvictory  it has obtained after 110 days of  strike!  I\r\n\r\nshall  refer  only to five of these rules to  indicate\r\n\r\nthe  types  of rules which have been accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 3 - using abusive language. A worker can be\r\n\r\nsubject to dismissal for using abusive language.  Sir,\r\n\r\neven  the  Member  for Cairnhill  will  say  that  the\r\n\r\nlanguage   in  a  factory  is  not  the  language   of\r\n\r\nParliament.  If  a  worker in the  Ford  factory  uses\r\n\r\nabusive language, he will be subject to dismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 5 - running in any building. If there is a\r\n\r\nfire  in  the factory, a worker should not run because\r\n\r\nhe will be  dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 9 - smoking in restricted areas or lavatories.\r\n\r\nYou  should  not  smoke  in  lavatories  in  the  Ford\r\n\r\nCompany. This is the agreement the union agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 26 - Sitting in Company cars and trucks during\r\n\r\nrest  period. During rest periods you should not  sit,\r\n\r\nand this is a company that assembles cars. There are a\r\n\r\nlot of old trucks but he must not be seated there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 27 - Obscenity. I imagine, Sir, the Managing\r\n\r\nDirector  of Ford Co, must belong to that strange  sex\r\n\r\nwho  does  not smoke, drink, and use abusive language,\r\n\r\nand   all  that  sinful,  and  he  has  imposed  these\r\n\r\nconditions on factory workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Fong Swee Suan, after 110 days of strike and\r\n\r\nafter  the  Union  obtained a  one-cent  increase,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of four days' wages as bonus, agreed  not  to\r\n\r\nuse  abusive language in the factory. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  said that their unions fought  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  standard of living of the workers. If the results\r\n\r\nobtained in the Ford Co, strike by Mr Fong Swee  Suan\r\n\r\nis  the  way  that the Barisan Sosialis  improves  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the workers, then, Sir, God help\r\n\r\nthe  workers, because they will have to work  over  25\r\n\r\nyears to enjoy the benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the industrial workers were out on strike, the\r\n\r\nclerical  workers  who are members  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses Employees Union stayed out from  21st\r\n\r\nNovember, 1961, to 29th September, 1961. I wonder  who\r\n\r\nis  going  to pay for the loss of salaries  that  they\r\n\r\nhave suffered during that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clerks stayed out, I am told that the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U, sent a letter to the Ford Co, claiming that\r\n\r\ntheir  members - these  are their  words - \"their  members\r\n\r\nhave  expressed their fears and will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nwork.\"  This  is  a  letter  written  by  the  General\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the Singapore Business Houses  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  writing to explain to the Factory  Manager  why\r\n\r\nthe   clerical  workers  who  were  members   of   the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U. would  not be able to attend  work,  while\r\n\r\nthere  was a strike organised by one of the unions  in\r\n\r\nthe   S.A.T.U. group  itself.  The  S.A.T.U. leaders\r\n\r\nfrightened  their own members by their  actions.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  could  no  longer control them  and  turned  the\r\n\r\nclerical  workers  into  strike  breakers.   On   29th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1961, while the strike was  still  on,  the\r\n\r\nclerical  workers  were instructed  by  the  union  to\r\n\r\nreturn  to  work. After the strike was over, belatedly\r\n\r\nthey  came  crawling  into the Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt for a decision on their claims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the clerical workers, which they could have  done\r\n\r\nlong before the strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are good strikes and bad strikes. There\r\n\r\nare  good  strikes that are won, and  there  are  good\r\n\r\nstrikes  that are lost. The Ford strike was lost,  and\r\n\r\nno amount of speeches by the Members for Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\nand  Thomson is going to deceive the workers that that\r\n\r\nstrike  was lost, and they went crawling back  to  the\r\n\r\nFactory under the conditions laid down by the Factory.\r\n\r\nThe  strike  was  lost because the leaders  asked  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  sacrifice themselves and they  themselves\r\n\r\nwere not prepared to make the same sacrifice - a loss of\r\n\r\n110  days  of wages, a loss which will take  years  to\r\n\r\nmake  up. This could have been avoided except for  the\r\n\r\npolitical policy of the union's pro-Communist  leaders\r\n\r\nto  avoid the Arbitration Court so that the Government\r\n\r\nwould not get credit for its policy of justice for the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of Singapore was denied the production\r\n\r\nfor which Singapore workers would have been paid wages\r\n\r\nwhich foreign workers enjoyed. If those cars that were\r\n\r\nsold  during  the  110  days  had  been  assembled  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  workers would have  been  paid  wages\r\n\r\nwhich   these  foreign  and  alien  Workers  who   had\r\n\r\nassembled them had gained during that time. The effect\r\n\r\non  the economy which the S.A.T.U. leaders pretend  to\r\n\r\nconsider  is  a  mockery. They  want  to  depress  the\r\n\r\neconomy for their political ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us explode the myth that these are trade union\r\n\r\nleaders  genuinely interested in the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  They  are,  as the history  of  this  strike\r\n\r\nshows, dragging on a strike for political purposes.  I\r\n\r\ncontend,  Sir,  that  if  the  S.A.T.U. leaders   had\r\n\r\nfollowed  the practices in our own laws,  the  workers\r\n\r\nwould  have  been spared this sacrifice. They  had  to\r\n\r\naccept the restrictive measures imposed on them by the\r\n\r\nCompany,  which  are unprecedented in Singapore - 27  of\r\n\r\nthem.  The  S.A.T.U. leaders accepted the restrictions\r\n\r\nbecause  they  wanted to increase the  misery  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers for political ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the  benefits  obtained  after  all  their\r\n\r\nstrikes? The Labour Report shows that the lowest wages\r\n\r\nearned  by workers in Singapore are by workers led  by\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions   where  daily-rated   workers   are\r\n\r\nmaintained as casual workers year after year. Not only\r\n\r\ndo  these  workers get less than $3 per day  but  they\r\n\r\nnever know how many days of work they will have  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   The  workers  in  the  rubber  industry   are\r\n\r\nrepresented  by the Singapore General Employees  Union \r\n\r\nand the Singapore Rubber Employees Union. The wages in\r\n\r\nthis   industry  have  persisted  with  little  change\r\n\r\nthroughout the period of prosperity of this industry. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.A.T.U. unions do not want to go to arbitration\r\n\r\nbecause they have to hide the low level of wages which\r\n\r\nthey  have agreed with some local employers. The court\r\n\r\nproceedings  will show the actual wage levels  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers led by the S.A.T.U. group. The S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\nof  unions are not fighting to improve the standard of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the workers. They want the workers  to  be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied, bring them out on prolonged strikes, and\r\n\r\nat the end, no benefits. All that S.A.T.U. strives for\r\n\r\nis dissatisfaction, misery and tension in order to use\r\n\r\nthe workers for the political ends of the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a matter of pride that Singapore has the\r\n\r\nbest  labour  legislation in South-East  Asia,  and  I\r\n\r\nchallenge  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  to  refute\r\n\r\nthis  and show proof of any country in Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nwhich  has  better labour legislation than  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere   is   no  other  country  in  Asia  which   has\r\n\r\nlegislation   similar  to  our  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which gives the force of law  to  certified\r\n\r\nagreements  and  an arbitration system  that  provides\r\n\r\njustice  and fair play. Our legislation could be  used\r\n\r\nto the maximum benefit for the workers if only the pro-Communist trade union leaders in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwanted genuinely to better the lives of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, tonight, when the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson was speaking, he told  the  House\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  had changed its  attitude  to  the\r\n\r\nworker.  He instanced four strikes in which he claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P. Government deliberately brought  out\r\n\r\nthe police to mishandle the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first strike that he mentioned was the Sassoon\r\n\r\nstrike.  In that strike there was trouble between  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the Branch of the Business Houses  Union\r\n\r\nand  the  employer. There was very bad feeling between\r\n\r\nthe  manager  of  that  firm and  the  Secretary,  and\r\n\r\ntension  was mounting. The matter was brought  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   and   after  a  lot  of   discussion,   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary persuaded the men  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  under  any circumstances  resort  to  any\r\n\r\nviolence,  or do anything that would put them  in  the\r\n\r\nwrong. When tension was mounting, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nremember  remaining in the office right  up  to  about\r\n\r\nhalf-past  five  or  six in the evening,  and  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary  came to see me at my request and  assured\r\n\r\nme  that  though  there was a lot of  tension  in  the\r\n\r\noffice  there  would be no trouble but  that  the  men\r\n\r\nwould quietly go home. Later that night I went to  the\r\n\r\nCrawford  Branch and was working there when I received\r\n\r\na  telephone call from Mr Kandasamy saying that there\r\n\r\nwas  trouble between the workers of Sassoon &  Company\r\n\r\nand  the Police and that the men had been injured. And\r\n\r\nhe  asked  me to go to the Central Police Station  and\r\n\r\nsee  things  for  myself. I told  Mr  Kandasamy  that\r\n\r\nbefore I left office -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister ought to\r\n\r\nrefer to Mr Kandasamy as the Parliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I beg your pardon, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture. I told him that\r\n\r\nI   had   received  an  assurance  from  Mr   Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary  that  there  would  be  no  trouble  that\r\n\r\nevening;  he  had assured me that the men  were  going\r\n\r\nhome peacefully; that they would leave the office. And\r\n\r\nI  expressed great surprise that they could have  been\r\n\r\nhurt,  in view of that assurance, and even if  it  was\r\n\r\ntrue  that they had been hurt, I said I was  the  last\r\n\r\nman  who  could  be of any assistance. All  that  they\r\n\r\ncould do was to make a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice  report and bring them to the General  Hospital\r\n\r\nfor  treatment. Immediately after that,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  Mr Woodhull rang me up at the Crawford  Branch.\r\n\r\nHe  asked me to come and see for myself. He said  that\r\n\r\nthe  men were rolling in pain. He said, \"You come.  We\r\n\r\ncould  lead  a demonstration against the  police.  You\r\n\r\ncome  with us to the Central Police Station. You  come\r\n\r\nwith us to the General Hospital and we can make a song\r\n\r\nand a dance about it.\" He said we should have a go  at\r\n\r\nthe  police.  That was the situation  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nSassoon strike was concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next morning I made inquiries.\r\n\r\nI  found  that,  in fact, after the assurance  Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary  had given me, the men remained  in  their\r\n\r\noffice and took possession of it. The police had to be\r\n\r\nsent  for and they were evicted as trespassers because\r\n\r\nthey  had  no  business to be in the office  of  their\r\n\r\nemployer after regular office hours. Now, is  it  fair\r\n\r\nfor the Member for Thomson to say that the police were\r\n\r\nbrought in by the Government to injure the strikers in\r\n\r\nthat particular wage dispute?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member also mentioned the\r\n\r\nGlass  Factory  strike. There  was  trouble  there.  A\r\n\r\nstrike position developed. I had reports that the main\r\n\r\nentrance  to the factory was barred. The men  had  put\r\n\r\nbenches at the main entrance. The management could not\r\n\r\nhave free access to their own factory. On that report,\r\n\r\nI  took  action. I asked Mr Lim Ching Siong  to  come\r\n\r\nwith  me to see for himself. He refused positively  to\r\n\r\ncome, saying that he had another engagement. But I was\r\n\r\nable  to  get  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan,  Mr  Bani,  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull,  Mr Dominic Puthucheary and Mr  Kandasamy,\r\n\r\nto  go  with  me to the factory gate. When we  arrived\r\n\r\nthere,  we  found benches right across  the  entrance.\r\n\r\nNobody  could get in or out of that factory. I  called\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the party with whom I  was  to  this\r\n\r\nobstruction  at  this  main gate.  Mr  Woodhull  said\r\n\r\nnothing. He would say nothing, Mr Speaker. But I  was\r\n\r\nable  to persuade Mr Fong to speak to the men and  to\r\n\r\ntell them that that was wrong. So we spoke to the  men\r\n\r\nand the position was explained to them, and those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenches  were  later removed. That was a strike  which\r\n\r\nlasted for a very long time. The upshot was this,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Many of the Malay workers insisted on  going\r\n\r\nback  to work. They were being kept out by the Chinese\r\n\r\npicketers.  They came to see me in the  Ministry,  and\r\n\r\nthey  asked me to open a special register for them.  I\r\n\r\nopened  a special register. They gave me their  names,\r\n\r\ntheir   identity  card  numbers  and  put  their   own\r\n\r\nsignatures on to a long list, saying that they  wanted\r\n\r\nto go back to work, but that they were being kept out.\r\n\r\nEventually  I had a meeting with them. I explained  to\r\n\r\nthem that if they did that, then they would be strike-breaking. They said never mind, the responsibility was\r\n\r\ntheirs.  They wanted to go back to work but they  were\r\n\r\nprevented  from  doing so by the other  strikers.  Now\r\n\r\npolice  assistance had to be rendered  to  them.  Then\r\n\r\nthere  was a fight naturally. There was resistance  by\r\n\r\nthe  strikers  who  did not want to  allow  the  Malay\r\n\r\nworkers to go to the factory, and something had to  be\r\n\r\ndone about it. Eventually with the help of the police,\r\n\r\nthese  Malays were able to get back to the factory  to\r\n\r\nwork.  When they were in, Mr Speaker, other  strikers\r\n\r\nlaid siege to that factory, so that those men were not\r\n\r\nable  to get out. They had to be supplied. Their  food\r\n\r\nhad  to  be brought in to them. Both Mr Woodhull  and\r\n\r\nMr  Fong Swee Suan realised that the men were  acting\r\n\r\nunfairly  in this strike, and it was through the  help\r\n\r\nof Mr Fong Swee Suan that the Secretary of the Branch\r\n\r\nunion was removed from his office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson patted\r\n\r\nhimself on the back and patted members of his group on\r\n\r\nthe  back for the good work that they have been  doing\r\n\r\nfor  the  Singapore Business Houses Employees'  Union.\r\n\r\nMr  Woodhull  had  for a long time  been  interesting\r\n\r\nhimself  in  the affairs of the clerical employees  in\r\n\r\nthe  commerical world. He first got an entry into  the\r\n\r\nMansfield Employees Union. I remember his coming in to\r\n\r\ntell  me that things were being very badly managed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Business Houses Union. There were people who were\r\n\r\npretending to be advisers of the Business Houses Union\r\n\r\nwho were, in fact, agents of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers  in that union, and they were betraying  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  the workers. He told me that it  was  about\r\n\r\ntime that he moved in. So I suspected then that he was\r\n\r\ntrying to penetrate that union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1960, I was invited by the Business\r\n\r\nHouses  Union  to their annual Christmas gathering  at\r\n\r\nthe  Victoria Memorial Hall. I got there  rather  late\r\n\r\nthat   night.   I  saw  at  the  main  table   Dominic\r\n\r\nPuthucheary, the Member for Thomson, and Kum Siew Yee.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a dance on, and in the course  of  it  the\r\n\r\nmusic  was  stopped. Then Mr Dominic Puthucheary  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Thomson got  on  to  the  stage  and\r\n\r\nharangued  the crowd. They were dressed in shirts  and\r\n\r\ntrousers.  But  I noticed that Mr Kum  Siew  Yee  was\r\n\r\nfully  clothed.  He had his coat on, a  nice  tie  and\r\n\r\nfully  dressed for the occasion. I have known Mr  Kum\r\n\r\nSiew  Yee for a very long time. In fact, when we  were\r\n\r\nengaged in the non-pensionable expatriation pay fight,\r\n\r\nhe  helped  to organise the teachers for  us  in  that\r\n\r\nfight. I have known that he had been indoctrinated  by\r\n\r\nMr   Devan  Nair,  who  had  fed  him  with   Marxist\r\n\r\nliterature  and  he was his tutor and mentor.  I  have\r\n\r\nalso  known  that a great change has  come  about  Mr\r\n\r\nDevan Nair. He once was a Communist, but he had broken\r\n\r\nwith  the Communists. But at the time that I spoke  to\r\n\r\nMr  Kum Siew Yee, I knew that he was a Communist, and\r\n\r\nthat  he  had not broken off his connections with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. So I said to him, \"Kum, what are you doing\r\n\r\nhere?\" He said, \"You know, Kenny, I really do not like\r\n\r\nall  this. You know we are dealing with this  English-educated lot. I have got to put up with it.\" There was\r\n\r\na  girl who was scantily clad. She was doing the hula-hula. He said, \"Look at all this. I have got to put up\r\n\r\nwith this. I wanted a demonstration. I wanted a rally.\r\n\r\nI  want to organise them. But here we have got to make\r\n\r\nallowance  for all this. I have got to sit around  and\r\n\r\nsee  all  this  go  on.\"  Woodhull  was  not  at  that\r\n\r\nChristmas gathering. It was then that I knew that, for\r\n\r\nthe first time, Woodhull had planted his agent in that\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before all this, and shortly after\r\n\r\nwe  became  the Government, I remember the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Business Houses Union coming to see me and asking\r\n\r\nme  to  help  them  to get a wage agreement  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Employers. They brought to me  a  draft\r\n\r\nagreement and asked me if I would assist them to chair\r\n\r\nmeetings between them and the Federation of Employers.\r\n\r\nI  did  so  on two or three occasions. Those men  were\r\n\r\nasking  for  four  things. The first thing  that  they\r\n\r\nwanted  was a gratuity scheme for the people who  were\r\n\r\nserving the commercial houses for many years and  were\r\n\r\nretiring  from  the  service. Some of  these  business\r\n\r\nfirms did give retirement benefits to their employees.\r\n\r\nThere  were  many  others  which  gave  no  retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits to their employees. And the delegation wanted\r\n\r\na  uniform  system  of retirement benefits.  That  was\r\n\r\ntheir first claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their next claim was that there should be proper\r\n\r\nredundancy  agreements drawn up  in  cases  where  the\r\n\r\nstaff were laid off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their third claim was for bonus payments. The\r\n\r\nemployers had always contended that a bonus was an ex-gratia  payment, in the sense that when  profits  were\r\n\r\ngood,  a  bonus was paid. If there was no  profit,  no\r\n\r\nbonus  was  paid. Whereas the union contended,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink with justice, that it had been a traditional way\r\n\r\nof  employment here where employers treated a bonus as\r\n\r\nsome sort of a deferred payment in the sense that if a\r\n\r\nman works for, say, a lower rate of wage, the employer\r\n\r\nwould  agree to pay him 13 months' pay for 12  months'\r\n\r\nwork  or 14 months' pay for 12 months' work. That  was\r\n\r\ntheir contention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their fourth claim was for wage scales. They were\r\n\r\nvery  tired of leaving all this to the good  sense  of\r\n\r\nthe employer to award his employees a wage increase on\r\n\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were their four claims which they regarded as\r\n\r\nfundamental. I chaired meetings between them  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Employers but we could  not  make  any\r\n\r\nheadway. The employers would not give in. It  is  true\r\n\r\nwhat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson said. They would have nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith a wage scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because we knew all this, we had\r\n\r\nmeanwhile  done something to bring in new  legislation\r\n\r\nso   that  we  could  provide  machinery  whereby   an\r\n\r\nindependent  tribunal  could order  that  an  employer\r\n\r\nintroduces a salary scale where he has refused  to  do\r\n\r\nso  and  that provision is written into the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance. Later, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in  the\r\n\r\nearly  months  of  1960,  the  Business  Houses  Union\r\n\r\nattempted  to  get agreements with three  firms.  They\r\n\r\nwere  Nestle's Products, United Engineers and the East\r\n\r\nAsiatic   Company.  At  the  time   that   they   were\r\n\r\nnegotiating with the union, the employers,  it  was  I\r\n\r\nthink  just  after the New Year, started paying  merit\r\n\r\nincrements. That meant some employees got increases in\r\n\r\npay, others got no increases in pay. Mr Woodhull, who\r\n\r\nwas  in control of this union, came to see me and said\r\n\r\nthat  this was very unfair. \"We want a wage scale,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  asking them to give us a wage scale.  They\r\n\r\nrefuse  it and they pay merit increments in this  way.\r\n\r\nSome  get  an  increase in the New  Year;  others  get\r\n\r\nnothing.\"  So  I  said  to Mr  Woodhull,  \"Would  you\r\n\r\npromise  me one thing? I am prepared to help  you.\"  I\r\n\r\nknow  that he was negotiating these agreements at  the\r\n\r\ntime. \"Would you provide for them? Would you insist on\r\n\r\nwriting into those agreements that the employer  would\r\n\r\nbe  restricted to paying only a wage scale and nothing\r\n\r\nbeyond  it? Demand wage scales and say that there  can\r\n\r\nbe  no  payments other than those provided for in  the\r\n\r\nwage scale. Go ahead. Put that in; demand that it goes\r\n\r\nin. If the employer refuses to put it in, I am telling\r\n\r\nyou  here that I am prepared to refer that dispute  to\r\n\r\nthe Arbitration Court. You make the demand, please. If\r\n\r\nit  is  refused,  then  the dispute  will  go  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, for two or three\r\n\r\nmonths  I  kept  calling him regularly on  the  phone.\r\n\r\n\"What  about it, Woodhull? Have you made the  demand?\"\r\n\r\nHe put me off with one pretext after another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did nothing. Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard that he\r\n\r\nhad  quietly  signed an agreement  with  the  employer\r\n\r\nwhich  provided  for no salary scale; just  increases.\r\n\r\n\"This year we get $10, next year we get $15,\" that was\r\n\r\nthe  sort of game he was playing. He signed agreements\r\n\r\nmaking  no provision for a salary scale, and  quietly.\r\n\r\nEverybody got his $10 increase or $15 increase for the\r\n\r\nyear,  $15  increase for the next year, and those  who\r\n\r\ngot   the   merit  increments  pocketed  those   merit\r\n\r\nincrements as well. Is that not selling out the white-collar worker? What is the use of their coming to this\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly now and saying  that  they  have\r\n\r\ntried  very  hard  with the employers  to  get  salary\r\n\r\nscales  for  the clerical workers, but conditions  are\r\n\r\nentirely  different  and it is a  different  industry.\r\n\r\nThey  spoke  of Mr Rattray and said that Mr  Rattray\r\n\r\nalso  confirmed that it is a different  industry.  The\r\n\r\nemployers  cannot give anybody any salary  scales.  We\r\n\r\nwere  offering  them  every  assistance  so  that  the\r\n\r\nclerical worker could get a salary scale. Now they say\r\n\r\nthat  they  have championed the cause  of  the  white-collar  worker. Where is the truth in all  that?  What\r\n\r\nprotection have the men got? They do not have a salary\r\n\r\nscale;   they   have  no  retirement  benefits.   Some\r\n\r\nagreements  provide for bonus, not all, and  very  few\r\n\r\nprovide  for  redundancy  agreements.  Where  is   the\r\n\r\nservice they have rendered to the clerical workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the very same time that all\r\n\r\nthis  was  going  on, the Singapore General  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion  was able to negotiate long-term agreements  for\r\n\r\nmessengers  of a bank. I know of an agreement  entered\r\n\r\ninto  between  the Chung Khiaw Bank and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees' Union which provides for a 21-year\r\n\r\nscale  with  increments at the minimum beginning  from\r\n\r\nabout  $160 up to a maximum of $319 a month, a 21-year\r\n\r\nscale  for  messengers. And yet  the  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union  said  they could  not  negotiate  a\r\n\r\nsalary  scale  for the clerical workers. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, all this was done, I would say, with deliberate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintent.  Here we were honestly and sincerely  offering\r\n\r\nthem  every  help so that they could get  the  workers\r\n\r\nsalary   scales   and   here  was   Woodhull   evading\r\n\r\nresponsibility  on  one  pretext  after  another.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the intent is this, that they want these\r\n\r\nworkers to be ever beholden to them. They do not  want\r\n\r\nto  see  anybody who is satisfied and contented.  They\r\n\r\nwant the workers as soon as the agreement expires,  to\r\n\r\ncome hack to them so that they can negotiate again and\r\n\r\nagain  and  be in control of these men for  all  time.\r\n\r\nThat is their purpose for refusing to negotiate for  a\r\n\r\nsalary  scale for clerical workers. So that it  is  no\r\n\r\nuse  of  time  Member for Thomson now coming  to  this\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  and  making   all   sorts   of\r\n\r\naccusations against the Government which he  knows  to\r\n\r\nbe  completely  untrue. It is no  use  his  trying  to\r\n\r\npretend that the Government has been anti-worker, that\r\n\r\nthe Government has been bullying the workers. He knows\r\n\r\nall that is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to industrial relations, it is true that we\r\n\r\nintroduced  the Industrial Relations Bill without  any\r\n\r\nconsultation with the unions. We also did not  consult\r\n\r\nthe  employers. We thought that it would be  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  us to introduce that legislation and then receive\r\n\r\nrepresentations.  As  a result of the  representations\r\n\r\nreceived from Messrs. Woodhull, Lim Ching Siong,  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee Suan and the group which was known as the 10 Tall\r\n\r\nMen, we put in the 50 amendments that were referred to\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Cairnhill. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\noriginal  Bill  provided  for automatic  reference  to\r\n\r\narbitration where an issue was deadlocked. They talked\r\n\r\nvehemently about it, particularly Mr Woodhull. Surely\r\n\r\nthat was a denial of the worker's right to strike.  In\r\n\r\na democracy all workers must, in the last resort, have\r\n\r\nthat  right. At the most, they were prepared to  leave\r\n\r\nit  to  the  discretion of the Minister.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  considered  that the dispute  should  go  to\r\n\r\narbitration, well, he could put it to arbitration.  We\r\n\r\nwere prepared to be reasonable with them. We knew that\r\n\r\nsituations can arise where it will be necessary for  a\r\n\r\nunion to strike. Take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation\r\n\r\ndispute. In that case, there was no dispute over wages\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of  service. It  was  just  that  the\r\n\r\nmanagement were being cussed. They were trying to deal\r\n\r\nwith  individual  employees behind  the  back  of  the\r\n\r\nunion. The union protested and said, \"Do not do  that.\r\n\r\nIt  is unfair that you should do that. Treat with us.\r\n\r\nYou  have  treated  with us. Since  you  have  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake  - we know that you have made a mistake  - if\r\n\r\nyou will just formally apologise to us and give us  an\r\n\r\nundertaking  that you will not treat us like  this  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  we  will  call  it a day.  We  will  take  no\r\n\r\naction.\" They just ignored them, with the result  that\r\n\r\nthe  men  went  on  strike. We  recognised  that  such\r\n\r\nsituations could occur and it was for that reason that\r\n\r\nwe  were prepared, us the Government, to take out that\r\n\r\nprovision  from  the  Bill  which  provided   for   an\r\n\r\nautomatic   reference  of  every  dispute   that   was\r\n\r\ndeadlocked  to the Industrial Arbitration  Court.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that Bill was passed. It was enacted  in\r\n\r\nthis   House  with  the  complete  approval  of  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen.  I  had  many  meetings  with  them.  Every\r\n\r\namendment  that they put to us was considered  on  its\r\n\r\nmerits  and  properly  discussed,  and  when  it   was\r\n\r\neventually  brought to this House,  it  was  with  the\r\n\r\nabsolute consent of all these gentlemen. As soon as we\r\n\r\nintroduced  that  Bill, they started sidetracking  it.\r\n\r\nThey had no intention of ever using its provisions.  I\r\n\r\nwas  offering  it to them in the case of the  clerical\r\n\r\nemployees. I told Woodhull, \"Do not be afraid  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  I am prepared to put it to the Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.  If  you  have  the  guts  to  write  into  the\r\n\r\nagreement  that  you want it to be provided  that  the\r\n\r\nemployers shall pay their employees the salaries  that\r\n\r\nare provided for in a scale, and if they refuse to  do\r\n\r\nit,  then the dispute will go to arbitration  and  you\r\n\r\ncould  get  an award on that.\" He was not  willing  to\r\n\r\nplay.  Why was he not willing to play? Because he  had\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of being completely dishonourable  and\r\n\r\ndishonest about this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have dealt fairly with them\r\n\r\nright through. They will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever  bring any dispute to the Labour Ministry.  They\r\n\r\ngo  off  on their own. The House heard what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  said, that he preferred to  bring  these\r\n\r\ndisputes to Mr Booker. He was happy to bring them  to\r\n\r\nMr  Booker.  He  challenged me. He  said,  \"There  is\r\n\r\nnothing to prevent us from doing it. Show us where  it\r\n\r\nis  provided  in  the  Bill that  we  cannot  see  Mr\r\n\r\nBooker.\"  They were the ones who asked us to keep  the\r\n\r\nlawyers out when we passed the Bill. They wanted us to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  lawyers out. They said it  was  unfair.  If\r\n\r\nlawyers  were  allowed  to come  into  all  this,  the\r\n\r\nemployers  would  be able to engage  the  best  talent\r\n\r\navailable.  They  would then be at a disadvantage.  It\r\n\r\nwas  they who made those representations to us. It was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  them that we had to get the lawyers  out.\r\n\r\nYet  the  Member for Thomson - what did he say? - said  he\r\n\r\npreferred to go and deal with Mr Booker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have watched them for over a\r\n\r\nlong  period and we are quite satisfied that they have\r\n\r\nnot the slightest intention of ever wanting to use the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of that Bill. They have also  referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Unions Ordinance. They said that we enacted\r\n\r\na piece of legislation and that we subsequently backed\r\n\r\ndown;  that  we let the unions down; that we  let  the\r\n\r\nworkers   down.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that   Ordinance\r\n\r\nprovided for what is known as the unification  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement. In that Ordinance it is provided\r\n\r\nthat a union can only be registered if it comes within\r\n\r\none  of the 19 categories that are provided for in the\r\n\r\nSchedule. It does not mean to say that there  must  be\r\n\r\nonly  19 unions, but that the union must be in one  of\r\n\r\nthose categories -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This letter requested that\r\n\r\nall  those  people's representatives with a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility should question the Government  on  the\r\n\r\nreasons for refusing to issue a permit for a series of\r\n\r\nacademic  publications to the students'  organisations\r\n\r\nunder the Printing Presses Ordinance. It also referred\r\n\r\nto the smear made in the statement by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs on the students' union. I have therefore\r\n\r\nrisen to say something on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people may ridicule me by\r\n\r\nsaying that when I was Parliamentary Secretary I spoke\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government, but that when I am now  no  more\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government  I  speak  for  those  who   are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with the Government, and that therefore I\r\n\r\nam  an  opportunist.  Well, I do  not  wish  to  argue\r\n\r\nagainst  this kind of criticism which may be  levelled\r\n\r\nagainst  me.  The question whether I am an opportunist\r\n\r\nor not can best be decided by facts as time goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come back to the main issue. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  from what I read in the Press of the open letter\r\n\r\nfrom the Nanyang University Students' Union and of the\r\n\r\nstatements  by  the  union and the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs, I got the feeling that it was the union which\r\n\r\nwas   reasonable.  Every  year  the  union  takes  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of the University Convocation in March  to\r\n\r\nhold  a  University  Week, recreational  and  cultural\r\n\r\nconcerts,  exhibitions  and academic  forums,  and  to\r\n\r\npublish  books on academic topics. This  practice  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  very  good  tradition of  the  students  in\r\n\r\nNanyang University. The University Students' Union has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  issue  books on Natural  Science,  Social\r\n\r\nScience,  Arts,  Political Studies  and  other  topics\r\n\r\nconcerning Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory  and Geography during University Week.  It  is\r\n\r\ndoing  this  in  order to promote studies  within  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  itself and to show to the  people  outside\r\n\r\n- especially  those  in  society - what  the  University\r\n\r\nstudents  have  achieved  in  the  field  of  academic\r\n\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of last year, it sent an application to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs for a permit under  the\r\n\r\nPrinting   Presses   Ordinance   for   a   series   of\r\n\r\npublications,  but  the Government insisted  that  the\r\n\r\napplication  should  come from the Vice-Chancellor  of\r\n\r\nthe University. The Minister for Home Affairs wrote  a\r\n\r\nletter  officially on 19th February to  the  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  stating  that the Government  had  refused  its\r\n\r\napplication for a permit. No explanation was given  in\r\n\r\nthe  letter of the Minister for Home Affairs as to why\r\n\r\nit  was insisted that the application should come from\r\n\r\nthe  Vice-Chancellor  instead of  from  the  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion.  The  Students' Union was set  up  as  a  legal\r\n\r\norganisation  under the Nanyang University  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIt  has  statutory  status and  the  capacity  to  act\r\n\r\nindependently. In this connection, the Vice-Chancellor\r\n\r\nof  the  Nanyang University has informed the Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  that  he  would  not  be  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\npublications. In fact, the legal adviser to the union,\r\n\r\nMr  David  Marshall, wrote to the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs requesting the Government to respect the legal\r\n\r\nposition of the union and not to delay the issue of  a\r\n\r\npermit.  But  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  still\r\n\r\nrefused  to issue a permit to the Students' Union  and\r\n\r\nno explanation was given for the refusal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University Week is just around the corner and the\r\n\r\nstudents  are very anxious about the whole  thing.  On\r\n\r\n22nd February, they issued a Press statement making  a\r\n\r\nreport  of  what  had  taken  place.  They  also  sent\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to see the Minister for Home  Affairs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he did not grant them an interview.  On\r\n\r\n2nd  March,  the  Ministry of' Home Affairs  issued  a\r\n\r\nPress statement alleging that the Students' Union  was\r\n\r\nunreasonable  in  its  attitude,  that  it   was   the\r\n\r\nintention of the union to produce propaganda  material\r\n\r\nagainst the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment, and that therefore it could be  seen  from\r\n\r\nall this that the so-called academic publications were\r\n\r\nin fact publications with political ends in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Nanyang University Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  has  experienced  many  difficulties  in   this\r\n\r\nmatter,  and  it has been wronged. So  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested  in the university education  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  not  take an indifferent view of this  matter.\r\n\r\nThe  students do not understand why they cannot get  a\r\n\r\npermit under the Printing Presses Ordinance for  their\r\n\r\npublications. They also do not understand why in  1960\r\n\r\nthe  union  was  successful in its application  for  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  permit for its publications,  but  that  this\r\n\r\nyear's  application was not approved and that  it  has\r\n\r\ninstead invited a smearing attack from the Government.\r\n\r\nThey do not understand why there is this difference in\r\n\r\nthese two years. Can we say that it is a bad intention\r\n\r\non the part of time students to publish books in order\r\n\r\nto  show how much they have achieved in their studies?\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean  that  the  getting  of  economic   and\r\n\r\nfinancial support and winning the sympathy of  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public should be interpreted by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs as non-academic political ends? Does\r\n\r\nit  also  mean that before Nanyang University can  see\r\n\r\neye   to  eye  with  the  Gwee  Ah  Leng  Report,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not wish to see the students  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity making individual improvements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University education is a very important factor in\r\n\r\ngiving  an  impetus  to  social  progress.  University\r\n\r\nundergraduates  should have freedom in their  studies,\r\n\r\nincluding   studies   on   political   problems.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should allow University students to express\r\n\r\nall  forms  of  political views and philosophies.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, together with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture, can influence the students of tile University\r\n\r\nthrough arguments but time Government should not  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  an  order  from the Ministry  of  Culture  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  the views of the students. They  should  not\r\n\r\ntry to curtail the freedom of speech of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are no longer living in a\r\n\r\nmedieval  age when those who went against  traditional\r\n\r\nthinking were oppressed. We must give encouragement to\r\n\r\nyoung  people to develop new thinking and  accept  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of new thoughts. It is only by  doing  this\r\n\r\nthat  we are able to make social progress. I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs will correct his present\r\n\r\nattitude in dealing with this question and rectify his\r\n\r\nmistake   accordingly.  I  appeal  to   the   Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  approve immediately the application  of\r\n\r\nthe Nanyang University Students Union for a permit. We\r\n\r\nalso hope that he will in a just manner try to get the\r\n\r\nsupport of the Nanyang University students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>00.17 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\njust now the Member for Upper Serangoon said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  act  in refusing the application  for  a\r\n\r\npermit  by  the  Students Union  was  to  curtail  the\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom of publication of the  students.  If\r\n\r\nthis  allegation  can  stand,  then  why  should   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  want the Vice-Chancellor to  send  in  the\r\n\r\napplication?  This  means that the Government  had  no\r\n\r\nintention  to  refuse the application of the  Students\r\n\r\nUnion to issue its publications. What we wanted was to\r\n\r\nget  the  Vice-Chancellor to be responsible for  these\r\n\r\npublications, because we were of the opinion  that  if\r\n\r\nthe    Vice-Chancellor   was   responsible   for   the\r\n\r\napplication  for  the  publications,  then  everything\r\n\r\nshould be all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government will definitely not\r\n\r\ninterfere  with  genuine  academic  freedom  and   the\r\n\r\nfreedom  to publish, unless some people want  to  make\r\n\r\nuse of academic freedom and the opportunity to publish\r\n\r\nbooks  for  political  ends. We have  records  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the applicant and the members  of  the\r\n\r\neditorial board. From these records we have reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that they may carry out anti-national and anti-people propaganda in their publications. Now, if  they\r\n\r\nsay  that  there is no academic freedom of publication\r\n\r\nin  Nanyang  University, then we will tell  them  that\r\n\r\nsince its inception there have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naltogether   been   16  societies  of   the   students\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Societies Ordinance. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe shortage of time, I would not like to list all the\r\n\r\nsocieties' names, but just want to mention a few. They\r\n\r\nare   the  Political  Science  Society,  the  Dramatic\r\n\r\nResearch  Society, the Chinese Language and Literature\r\n\r\nResearch  Society, the History and Geography  Society,\r\n\r\nand  so on. I only mention a few to save time. If they\r\n\r\nsay  that there is no academic freedom, how is it that\r\n\r\nthere have been 31 different types of publications  by\r\n\r\nthe   Nanyang  student  bodies  permitted  under   the\r\n\r\nPrinting  Presses Ordinance? Because  of  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntime,  I  would  not  like  to  mention  all  the   31\r\n\r\npublications. I will mention only a few. They are  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Tribune, the University Youth,  the  Suloh\r\n\r\nNantah  and  Political Science.  The  registration  of\r\n\r\nthese  16 student societies has been allowed, and  the\r\n\r\n31  publications  by  these  16  societies  have  been\r\n\r\napproved  by  the Government also. All the  University\r\n\r\nacademic  forums and debates conducted by the students\r\n\r\nhave not been interfered with in any form. From the 31\r\n\r\npublications,  we  can  see  many  articles  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not interfered with them at  all.  This\r\n\r\ngoes  to  show  that  there  is  academic  freedom  of\r\n\r\npublication  in the University. As a matter  of  fact,\r\n\r\nthere   are   many  publications  by  the   University\r\n\r\nstudents,  such  as  the  University  Tribune,   which\r\n\r\ncontain  articles outside the scope of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nacademic studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the 26th issue of the University\r\n\r\nTribune,  in celebration of Women's Day, has published\r\n\r\nwith  superficial changes an article by a person known\r\n\r\nas  Yu Tze Niu with the title of \"The Women's Movement\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and Malaya in Retrospect and  Prospect\".\r\n\r\nThis  article  has  been  written  on  the  lines   of\r\n\r\nCommunist arguments based on a similar article by  Lie\r\n\r\nKiu,  a  member of M.C.P. Because of the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntime,  I  would  just like to quote a short  paragraph\r\n\r\nfrom  this article to compare with Lie Kiu's  to  show\r\n\r\nits true nature. The paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The women's movement in Malaya started roughly\r\n\r\nafter 1925. At that time Malaya was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  midst of a world economic crisis because  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists  were  trying  all  out  to  exploit   the\r\n\r\ncolonies:  and being in a colonial Malay a, women  had\r\n\r\nto  suffer  from the exploitation by the colonialists.\r\n\r\nSo there was a common objective to combat and struggle\r\n\r\nagainst  the  exploitation  and  suppression  of   the\r\n\r\nimperialists  in our country for women's  emancipation\r\n\r\nand national emancipation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a paragraph in Lie Kiu's article in\r\n\r\ncommemoration  of Women's Day. This was  contained  in\r\n\r\nVol.  I of `The New Women's Monthly' published on  8th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1946,  in  which  it was  stated  that:  `Tile\r\n\r\nOverseas  Chinese Women's Movement in  Malaya  started\r\n\r\nafter 1925. At that time Malaya was in the grip  of  a\r\n\r\nworld   economic   crisis  and  all   the   time   the\r\n\r\nimperialists  were  trying to take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonies, particularly of women, ...' and so on, and  the\r\n\r\nrest also about the same. So we can see that these two\r\n\r\narticles  were  quite similar. The only difference  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  Communist magazine the words  \"Overseas\r\n\r\nChinese\" were mentioned, but in the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nTribune  they have thought fit to leave out this  term\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  already out of place at  the  present\r\n\r\ntime.  From  this  also we can see  clearly  that  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. is  a  Party which owes its  allegiance  to  a\r\n\r\nforeign country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, there are many other articles of a\r\n\r\nCommunist  nature.  In  fact,  these  articles  are  a\r\n\r\nreprint  with  a changed appearance of some  Communist\r\n\r\narticles.  For  example, in March 1961  there  was  an\r\n\r\narticle  published in the Political  Science  entitled\r\n\r\n\"The  New  Spirit of Seeking Concord while Maintaining\r\n\r\nDifferences\", written by an underground worker of  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. named  Lim Hock Khoon. Does it not  mean  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  academic  freedom and freedom  of  academic\r\n\r\npublications? What they are trying to get is Communist\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are  under  no\r\n\r\nobligation  to protect this kind of academic  freedom.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter  of fact, the behaviour of  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Students Union is an insult and an  affront\r\n\r\nto  the  true sense of academic freedom. They call  it\r\n\r\nacademic pursuit, when in fact it is not so. They  are\r\n\r\njust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking  use  of time terms \"academic freedom\"  through\r\n\r\nstudents'   publications  to   carry   out   Communist\r\n\r\npropaganda   work.  They  themselves  are   short   of\r\n\r\ninspiration  and  so  they have to  copy  from  banned\r\n\r\nCommunist   magazines  and  articles.  The   fact   is\r\n\r\nundeniable, though they may say it is a smear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon has brought up this\r\n\r\nquestion.  We  are  aware of  his  intention.  He  has\r\n\r\nbrought it up in order to raise his personal prestige,\r\n\r\nbecause  when  he  was  in the  P.A.P. he  was  quite\r\n\r\narrogant,  and because of his behaviour  he  lost  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of many people. This is a common fact among\r\n\r\nthe students in Nanyang University. If he should refer\r\n\r\nto  a  criticism written then by Ign Hsentan  then  he\r\n\r\nwill  know  about all these things. He himself  was  a\r\n\r\nmember   of   an  underground  Communist  organisation\r\n\r\nbefore.  So he would like to see propaganda  work  for\r\n\r\nCommunism  carried cut under the pretext  of  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  in  order  to restore his personal  prestige.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  he  will say that I am saying  this  just  to\r\n\r\nsmear  him. Now, perhaps he says this is a smear,  how\r\n\r\nis  it  that when this House was debating the question\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  the  Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nopenly  accused him of being an open front  worker  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, and at that time he  dared  not  deny\r\n\r\nit'?  Because he knew if he did he would be confronted\r\n\r\nwith many irrefutable facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes, because the Minister has\r\n\r\nmade a personal attack against me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order at all.
