However,  it  is\r\n\r\nobviously not possible to meet the wishes of every\r\n\r\nparent  in  regard to the choice of  a  particular\r\n\r\nschool.   No  system  of  allocation  can   please\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of allocation for the Chinese\r\n\r\nand  English streams, which has been in  operation\r\n\r\nsince 1965, is processed by computers. It is based\r\n\r\non  the  choice exercised by the parents  and  the\r\n\r\nresults of the Primary School Leaving Examination.\r\n\r\nUnder  this system the vast majority of successful\r\n\r\ncandidates  are  posted to schools  of  their  own\r\n\r\nchoice.  For example, in 1966, out of a  total  of\r\n\r\n32,602  successful candidates, 21,074 were  posted\r\n\r\nto  schools  according to their first choice,  and\r\n\r\n6,036   were  posted  according  to  their  second\r\n\r\nchoice. Only 5,492 or 16.8 per cent were posted to\r\n\r\nschools  other  than  their  choice,  because  all\r\n\r\nvacancies  in  the  schools of their  choice  were\r\n\r\ntaken  up by other candidates with better  results\r\n\r\nin  the Primary School Leaving Examination.  Among\r\n\r\nthe  5,492  pupils who failed to  secure  a  place\r\n\r\nunder  their first as well as second choice, about\r\n\r\n5,200 applied for transfers. Of these, 4,600  were\r\n\r\napproved  and  only  600 could  not  be  approved,\r\n\r\nbecause all vacancies in schools near their  homes\r\n\r\nhad  already  been taken up by other  pupils  with\r\n\r\nbetter examination results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister  has  said  that,  subject   to\r\n\r\nadequate provision in the 1968 Budget, it  appears\r\n\r\nthat  all  students who passed the Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving  Examination would be given places.

As\r\n\r\nthe number of such children is enormous, it is not\r\n\r\npossible  to  retain pupils in Primary  1  without\r\n\r\ndepriving  some of these school-going children  of\r\n\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is also considered unsound by\r\n\r\neducationists to retain pupils at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst year in school for psychological reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Lim Tay Boh Commission of inquiry\r\n\r\nrecommended that the first three years of  primary\r\n\r\nschool   work  should  be  planned  as  a   single\r\n\r\ncoordinated  unit and the final  assessment  of  a\r\n\r\nchild's progress should be made at the end of  the\r\n\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Minister  has  just  now  given  us  an\r\n\r\nexplanation.

So  we should not allow  them  to  be\r\n\r\npromoted  automatically if they are not qualified.\r\n\r\nWe  should  know that studying is like building  a\r\n\r\nhouse. In order to build a multi-storey house, the\r\n\r\nfoundations should be deeper and the piling should\r\n\r\nbe  stronger.

It  is\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the   absence  of   official   film\r\n\r\nclassification and the awareness of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe majority of film goers are youths and children\r\n\r\nthat the Board of Film Censors is very careful  to\r\n\r\nensure that all films passed for public exhibition\r\n\r\nare  suitable for the viewing of both  adults  and\r\n\r\nchildren  alike.

Free  car\r\n\r\nparks are provided in central localities and  near\r\n\r\nto shopping facilities in Housing Board estates as\r\n\r\npart and parcel of the approved layout. These  car\r\n\r\nparks  are made up to approved standards and taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the P.W.D. Instead of providing one  car\r\n\r\npark   for   each  flat  as  required  in   luxury\r\n\r\napartments, in the low-cost housing estates of the\r\n\r\nBoard  the  ratio is one car park for  each  seven\r\n\r\nflats.  On  this  basis the car parking  and  road\r\n\r\nnetwork of Queenstown has been planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the income of people living in\r\n\r\nflats  in  Queenstown has increased and  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  of  them have bought motor-cars.  There  has\r\n\r\nalso been a considerable increase in the number of\r\n\r\npirate  taxis.  As a result, in Queenstown  motor-cars overflowed from the available car parks on to\r\n\r\nthe public roads, causing traffic congestion. Many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  were received and the  traffic  police\r\n\r\nhad   difficulty  in  sorting  out  this   traffic\r\n\r\nproblem.  Initially a one-way traffic  system  was\r\n\r\nintroduced, but even this proved to be  inadequate\r\n\r\nwhen cars\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere parked on both sides of one-way streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce congestion, it was decided to draw\r\n\r\nwhite lines on the roads in order that these roads\r\n\r\nwould not be blocked. It was anticipated that  the\r\n\r\ndrawing  of  white lines on these one-way  streets\r\n\r\nwould  result  in motor-cars having difficulty  in\r\n\r\nfinding parking places. Some provision, therefore,\r\n\r\nhad to be made to accommodate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lots of Housing Board land which had been set\r\n\r\naside   for   other   purposes  were,   therefore,\r\n\r\nconverted into car parks for those prepared to pay\r\n\r\na  small fee to park their cars in these two lots.\r\n\r\nThese  two lots can accommodate 185 and  250  cars\r\n\r\nrespectively.  On the1st of July  this  year,  the\r\n\r\ntenants  of  Queenstown were invited, if  they  so\r\n\r\nwished,  to  put their cars in these parking  lots\r\n\r\nfor  a  fee  of  $12  per  month.  The  fees  were\r\n\r\ndetermined  on  the  basis  that  costs  will   be\r\n\r\nrecovered over a period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first three months, of the 435 lots\r\n\r\nprovided, an average of about 200 lots were  taken\r\n\r\nup.  The  Board  expects that  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty, once the tenants get used to the  idea\r\n\r\nof parking in these lots, for the lots to be fully\r\n\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other housing estates where open space or\r\n\r\nsuitable  land  is  available, similar  facilities\r\n\r\nwill  be  provided  and a fee charged  to  recover\r\n\r\ncosts.

W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, on the 14th\r\n\r\nDecember  last year I informed the House that  the\r\n\r\nCorrupt   Practices   Investigation   Bureau   was\r\n\r\nconducting  investigations  into  certain  alleged\r\n\r\nmalpractices    in   connection   with    building\r\n\r\nconstruction  carried  out  by  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. These investigations  followed\r\n\r\ninformation  received  in  August  1966   by   the C.P.I.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  certain  piling work carried  out  for  the\r\n\r\nBoard  by  Gammon (Malaya) Ltd., a firm of  piling\r\n\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of these investigations revealed that\r\n\r\nthere had been extensive malpractices resulting in\r\n\r\nconsiderable over-payments by the Board to  Gammon\r\n\r\nunder  the  terms  of  the  various  contracts  in\r\n\r\nquestion.  As  soon  as  sufficient  evidence  was\r\n\r\navailable from the C.P.I.B., steps were  taken  to\r\n\r\nuncover and measure a small number of piles at Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.   The  results  of  these  physical   tests\r\n\r\nconfirmed  the  findings of the  C.P.I.B. and  in\r\n\r\nDecember 1966 Gammon were informed that they would\r\n\r\nbe held responsible. Discussions were held between\r\n\r\nthe  Board and Gammon and between their respective\r\n\r\nlegal  advisers, as a result of which  early  this\r\n\r\nyear  Gammon  agreed to accept full liability  for\r\n\r\nall over-payments for any structural defects which\r\n\r\nmight  arise as a result of inadequate piling  and\r\n\r\nfor  further incidental expenses incurred  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  as  a result of the delay in completion  of\r\n\r\ncertain of the contracts. Gammon also undertook to\r\n\r\nbear  the full cost of any investigation necessary\r\n\r\nto establish the extent of the over-payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majority of the contracts affected, the\r\n\r\nbuildings   concerned  were   all   completed   or\r\n\r\nsubstantially approaching completion at  the  date\r\n\r\nwhen  these malpractices became known,  it  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   be   impossible,  without   incurring\r\n\r\nenormous  expense  out of all  proportion  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard's   claim,  to  make  a  full  and  accurate\r\n\r\nphysical  measurement of the short-piling involved\r\n\r\nfor  reasons which will be very obvious. The Board\r\n\r\ndid,   however,  instruct  a  firm  of  consultant\r\n\r\nengineers,  experts in this particular  field,  to\r\n\r\nmake  a survey and an analysis of the short-piling\r\n\r\nby  the  best and the most efficient method known,\r\n\r\nshort  of demolishing the buildings concerned  and\r\n\r\nlifting the piles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this survey and on the advice of its\r\n\r\nlegal  adviser,  the Board has  reached  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  Gammon  on  terms which  have  already  been\r\n\r\npublished in the form of a statement by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman  of  Gammon. The settlement involves  the\r\n\r\npayment  to  the  Board of  an  aggregate  sum  of\r\n\r\n$2,700,000, over $2 million of which is  allocated\r\n\r\nto compensation for over-payments on short-piling.\r\n\r\nThe remainder represents compensation for the cost\r\n\r\nof   reinstatement,  losses  due   to   delay   in\r\n\r\ncompletion,  and the cost of investigation  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  which  the Board  has  been  fully\r\n\r\nindemnified.  In  addition, the  expenses  of  the\r\n\r\nconsultant   engineers  and  the   Board's   legal\r\n\r\nexpenses are to be met by Gammon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigations which have been carried out\r\n\r\nhave  implicated  a  number of individuals,  among\r\n\r\nthem  some employees of Gammon and certain of  the\r\n\r\nclerks  of  works employed by the Board.  Criminal\r\n\r\ncharges  have been preferred against five persons,\r\n\r\none  employed  by Gammon and four  by  the  Board,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960, and other charges of a similar character are\r\n\r\ncontemplated. It would not be appropriate at  this\r\n\r\nstage   for  me  to  say  any  more  about   these\r\n\r\nproceedings which are still pending. In  addition,\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  proceedings have been taken  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard, as a result of which, after due inquiry, 12\r\n\r\nclerks  of  works  have been  dismissed,  one  has\r\n\r\nabsconded  and one resigned before an inquiry  was\r\n\r\nheld. Inquiries with a view to the dismissal of  a\r\n\r\nfurther  three clerks of works remain to be  held.\r\n\r\nOther   disciplinary  proceedings  are   also   in\r\n\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement reached between the Board and\r\n\r\nGammon   is  subject  to  reopening   if   it   is\r\n\r\nestablished   that  any  director  or  responsible\r\n\r\nmember of the managerial staff of Gammon not below\r\n\r\nthe rank of chief engineer, past or present, was a\r\n\r\nparty   to   or   at  that  time  aware   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances resulting in the short-piling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the House will wish to be assured, as is\r\n\r\nin  fact the case, that all proper steps have been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  ensure that, despite the  frauds  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  committed, all the  Board's  flats  in\r\n\r\nquestion  are  structurally  sound.  The   Board's\r\n\r\nconsulting  engineers have been  asked  to  report\r\n\r\nfully on this, and I am satisfied, as a result  of\r\n\r\nwhat they say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthat  the  Board's flats in question are  in  fact\r\n\r\nstructurally sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I have three\r\n\r\nquestions to pose to the Minister. First, has  the\r\n\r\nsum  of  $2.7 million been paid? Second, is  there\r\n\r\nany guarantee or security to ensure that Gammon do\r\n\r\nnot fail in their payments? Third, what safeguards\r\n\r\nhave  the  Housing Board taken to prevent  future\r\n\r\nfrauds of a similar nature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> As to the first question, which\r\n\r\nrefers to the sum of $2,700,000, the agreement was\r\n\r\nthat  $1,200,000 was to be paid on the signing  of\r\n\r\nthe agreement. That sum has been paid. The balance\r\n\r\nof  $1 \u00bd  million is to be paid by Gammon in  three\r\n\r\ninstalments.  The first instalment of  $\u00bd  million\r\n\r\nwithin  six  months of the date of the  agreement,\r\n\r\nand the two remaining instalments at intervals  of\r\n\r\nsix  months  after that. The agreement itself  was\r\n\r\nsigned  on the 8th day of September this year.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  ensure that payment is made by  Gammon,\r\n\r\nthe  Board insisted on Gammon providing a banker's\r\n\r\nguarantee that the three instalments of $\u00bd million\r\n\r\neach will be forthcoming. I think that answers the\r\n\r\nfirst two questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to be satisfied that steps\r\n\r\nhave been taken by the Board to prevent frauds  of\r\n\r\na  similar  nature. Sir, the frauds were  in  fact\r\n\r\ncommitted  because of lack of supervision  on  the\r\n\r\npiling  site, lack of supervision over the  clerks\r\n\r\nof  works  and Gammon's men on the site.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the  Board has taken steps to  introduce\r\n\r\nmore effective means of supervision to prevent the\r\n\r\noccurrence  of irregularities in future contracts.\r\n\r\nResident engineers are now stationed on the  major\r\n\r\npiling sites. In fact, the Board has created  more\r\n\r\nposts for such engineers and it is now possible to\r\n\r\nhave  these engineers permanently stationed  on  a\r\n\r\nrotation  basis  on  the  piling  sites.   As   an\r\n\r\nadditional safeguard, to enable checks to be  made\r\n\r\nat  any time after the piles have been driven into\r\n\r\nthe  ground,  a half-inch diameter  iron  pipe  is\r\n\r\ninserted into the centre of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npile  in  a  group of piles, the  group  of  piles\r\n\r\nconsisting of about two to five piles. This is  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  length of the pile to be measured  at\r\n\r\nany  time  after the piling has been completed  by\r\n\r\nthe  insertion  of a flexible iron  rod.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nSir,  internal  technical audit checks  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  on the piling and building sites.  The\r\n\r\nTechnical Audit Team makes periodic visits  to  do\r\n\r\nsurprise checks. These are the measures the  Board\r\n\r\nis taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Members are aware that the\r\n\r\nsuspension on Gammon tendering for future work  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board  has  been lifted as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nsettlement,  and  Gammon have been  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  what measures they themselves will take  to\r\n\r\nensure  or  to prevent frauds of a similar  nature\r\n\r\ntaking place again. And Gammon have replied to the\r\n\r\nBoard stating that, firstly, no officers and other\r\n\r\nemployees  involved in the over-claims  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  employ of the company or any of its associate\r\n\r\ncompanies and that they have been replaced by  men\r\n\r\nof proven probity. Secondly, piling work by Gammon\r\n\r\nwill  he  carried  out  by  direct  labour  on  an\r\n\r\nincentive  pay  basis under stricter  supervision,\r\n\r\nand  sub-contractors shall not be employed for any\r\n\r\npiling  work in Singapore. Thirdly, the  company's\r\n\r\ntechnical  auditor  is now under  instructions  to\r\n\r\nconduct  an  independent  scrutiny  of  all  their\r\n\r\npiling  contracts and personnel employed  by  them\r\n\r\nunhindered  in any way as a matter of policy  laid\r\n\r\ndown by the Board of Management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather\r\n\r\ndisturbed  by  the Minister's statement  that  the\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  Gammon has been  lifted  and  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a possibility of future work being  done\r\n\r\nby  them.  No  doubt  they have  been  asked  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  they  are  taking  to  prevent   further\r\n\r\nfrauds, and it is interesting to hear their  reply\r\n\r\nabout \"men of proved ability\". But I was wondering\r\n\r\nwhether they were men of proved integrity  too.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Minister  will  consider  not\r\n\r\naccepting tenders from Gammon any longer since, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  can see, there is no dearth of  piling\r\n\r\nfirms in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further question I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, and that is whether the balance  of\r\n\r\n$1\u00bd  million  to  be  paid over three  instalments\r\n\r\nattracts  interest, and if so, at what  per  cent,\r\n\r\nand if not, why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that\r\n\r\na  member  of  the  Bar should  ask  me,  after  a\r\n\r\nsettlement  in which the Housing Board  is  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  $2,700,000,  why  Gammon's  suspension   was\r\n\r\nlifted. The answer is simple. If the Board had not\r\n\r\nagreed  to  lift the suspension, Gammon would  not\r\n\r\nhave paid $2.7 million. It is a big sum. The other\r\n\r\nalternative was to take them to court,  and  again\r\n\r\nhere  a  member of the Bar should know that  court\r\n\r\nproceedings  take a long time and,  in  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis, the Board may get more, maybe  a  little\r\n\r\nmore, or they may get less. But in any settlement,\r\n\r\nthere  must  be give and take. The fact  that  the\r\n\r\nsuspension has been lifted means that Gammon, like\r\n\r\nother   contractors,  can  tender.  There  is   no\r\n\r\nguarantee that their tenders will be accepted. But\r\n\r\nthere are measures taken by the Board not only  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  work  sites,  on  which  Gammon   are\r\n\r\nemployed, but also of other piling contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, there is no agreement\r\n\r\nfor  interest  to  be paid on the  sum  of  $1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  Member wants to know why  not.  The\r\n\r\nanswer is this. Gammon were in no position to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board $2.7 million in cash. There was\r\n\r\nbargaining  on  the final figure, whether  it  was\r\n\r\n$2.5 million or $2.7 million. But the question  of\r\n\r\ninterest was not taken up by the Board because, in\r\n\r\nthe final analysis, it was the Board's figure that\r\n\r\nwas   accepted  by  Gammon,  not  Gammon's  figure\r\n\r\naccepted by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Does the Minister agree that\r\n\r\n$1\u00bd  million in one and a half years' time is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  worth  less than $1\u00bd million  now?

Since\r\n\r\ninvestigations  started, no  contracts  have  been\r\n\r\nawarded  to  Gammon  as yet.  I  cannot  tell  you\r\n\r\nexactly how many piling contracts were awarded  to\r\n\r\nGammon in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the $2.7 million, roughly $2,098,000 was\r\n\r\nin  respect of short-piling. I do not think I need\r\n\r\nbother  you  with details, but I have the  figures\r\n\r\nhere showing how the sum of $2,098,000 is made  up\r\n\r\nin respect of contracts all over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nisland.  It  adds up to $2,098,000  based  on  the\r\n\r\ncalculations  of  the  consultants.  Roughly,   it\r\n\r\nrepresents about 20 per cent of the total cost  of\r\n\r\npiling work done by Gammon. The uncovering of  the\r\n\r\npiles  at  Toa  Payoh revealed that  there  was  a\r\n\r\nshortage of roughly 20 per cent. It was physically\r\n\r\nimpossible to go around Singapore pulling up piles\r\n\r\nfrom  occupied buildings. So the estimate  was  20\r\n\r\nper  cent right round the island. And 20 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  a  little more than $10 million works  out  to\r\n\r\nabout $2,098,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the balance - a sum of roughly $350,000 - $300,000 was for compensation in respect of delay\r\n\r\ncovering  nine blocks in Toa Payoh; $50,000  being\r\n\r\nthe  amount estimated to be payable to the Board's\r\n\r\ncontractor for uncovering the piles. Then you have\r\n\r\nother  items  like investigation costs,  including\r\n\r\nprofessional  fees  and wages  of  the  Board  and\r\n\r\nP.W.D. personnel  involved in the  investigations\r\n\r\ninto  the said short-piling. And then the cost  of\r\n\r\nreinstating  buildings damaged or demolished.  But\r\n\r\nin a settlement for a lump sum of $2.7 million, it\r\n\r\nis   difficult  to  say  how  much  went  to  each\r\n\r\nparticular item. But the bigger part of  the  sum,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  nearly $2,100,000 was estimated  to  be  in\r\n\r\nrespect of short-piling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joe Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know who will be responsible  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board  in  the  event of possible  structural\r\n\r\ndamage  to  flats?

The  first  phase   of   the\r\n\r\nreclamation scheme of foreshore and sea-bed  along\r\n\r\nUpper  East Coast Road from the junction of  Bedok\r\n\r\nRoad was a pilot scheme completed in late 1963 and\r\n\r\nrealised a surveyed area of 37 acres. Work on  the\r\n\r\nsecond   phase,  the  1,000-acre  reclamation   of\r\n\r\nforeshore  from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu  approved  in\r\n\r\n1965   by   the  then  Legislative  Assembly,   is\r\n\r\nprogressing  satisfactorily according to  schedule\r\n\r\nand  is expected to be completed by mid-1970.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  now proposes to reclaim a further  306\r\n\r\nacres  of  foreshore  from the Singapore  Swimming\r\n\r\nClub  right up to the end of Tanjong Rhu and  from\r\n\r\nNicoll   Highway  to  Elizabeth  Walk,  near   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  River mouth.

The first part will  comprise  the\r\n\r\nreclamation   of  80  acres  from  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nSwimming Club to the end of Tanjong Rhu. The  fill\r\n\r\nwill  come  from Bedok where there  is  sufficient\r\n\r\nearth  for  this reclamation as well and  will  be\r\n\r\ntransported   by  an  extension  of  the   present\r\n\r\nconveyor  belt system already in use.  The  second\r\n\r\npart  will consist of the reclamation of 226 acres\r\n\r\nalong  Nicoll  Highway up to the  Singapore  River\r\n\r\nmouth.  The fill will come from excess earth  from\r\n\r\nthe development at Seventh Precinct No. 1, Erskine\r\n\r\nHill,  the  balance of the Tiong Bahru fire  site,\r\n\r\nQueenstown  neighbourhood.  6  and  7,  and  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah New Town. It is anticipated that the whole\r\n\r\nproject will be completed by 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No firm decision has been made on the utilisation\r\n\r\nof this land.

In this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nheartily  support the motion of  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nreclaim   the  foreshore  and  sea-bed  from   the\r\n\r\nlocation of the Singapore Swimming Club at Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu  to  the Esplanade as delineated on  the  plan\r\n\r\nwhich is at present deposited at the Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate that using\r\n\r\nmodern machinery to reclaim land is very efficient\r\n\r\nas  evidenced by the present reclamation at Bedok,\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether, in view of our large pool\r\n\r\nof  unemployed labour, the Minister could consider\r\n\r\nthe possibility of employing more manual labour in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreclamation  rather than having  it  all  done  by\r\n\r\nmachinery - capital-intensive - just conveyor belts,\r\n\r\ncutters   and   special  machines   for   filling.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily it is no doubt more efficient and  much\r\n\r\nquicker, possibly even less expensive, to do it by\r\n\r\nmachinery, but there are special circumstances  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and I would commend to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nhis attention my suggestion on using more labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, on principle, I support the Minister\r\n\r\nin his policy to reclaim more land for development\r\n\r\npurposes.  However, I am afraid  that  because  of\r\n\r\nthis massive programme of reclamation we will have\r\n\r\nto  suffer a great loss in our natural sea-bed and\r\n\r\nforeshore.   This   will,  of  course,   mar   our\r\n\r\nreputation as a beautiful island State. This  will\r\n\r\naffect indirectly our tourist trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward to the Minister my\r\n\r\nsuggestion   that   when   reclamation   work   is\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  future  the  location  should   be\r\n\r\ndiverted,  that is to say, instead  of  reclaiming\r\n\r\nthe sea-bed, we should level off the hills and use\r\n\r\nthe  earth  to fill in the marsh lands and  swampy\r\n\r\nareas.  This will certainly go towards  increasing\r\n\r\nour  land  area and, at the same time,  preserving\r\n\r\nthe   beautiful  view  of  the  horizon  from  our\r\n\r\nseashore. This will give an impetus to tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I may deal with the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang who has suggested that  we  employ\r\n\r\nmore labour. The answer, for the present contract,\r\n\r\nis  a  big \"No\". The reason is that the first part\r\n\r\nof the reclamation has been let out by tender to a\r\n\r\nJapanese  firm  of  contractors  and  we  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  bound by that contract. And it is  up  to\r\n\r\nthis  firm to decide whether or not they  want  to\r\n\r\nuse  their  machines or use more labour.

His grouse is that  we  are\r\n\r\nreclaiming land from the sea and, as a result,  he\r\n\r\nsays  we have lost our seashore. I really  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  we  lose the seashore.  When  you\r\n\r\nreclaim a coast, all you are doing is to push  the\r\n\r\nseacoast  back but it is still there. He  suggests\r\n\r\nthat  we  reclaim  swamps and  low-lying  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  can assure him that that  is  being\r\n\r\ndone   and   has  been  done  in  the  past.   The\r\n\r\noutstanding example is Jurong which was  reclaimed\r\n\r\nfrom  a  swamp.  Another  bright  example  is  the\r\n\r\nreclamation which is now taking place  at  Kranji.\r\n\r\nBut  the  land along East Coast Road is a valuable\r\n\r\nstrip  and will provide Singapore, which  is  only\r\n\r\n224  square miles of land, with another two square\r\n\r\nmiles  of land.

The  administration  of\r\n\r\nthese  services is in the hands of the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee which have been effective\r\n\r\nin  carrying out the projects and, to a very large\r\n\r\ndegree,  have  made life in the rural  areas  more\r\n\r\ntolerable  by the bringing of modern amenities  to\r\n\r\nthe rural folks and by the building of bridges and\r\n\r\nrepairing of roads.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Budget for the year 1967, a\r\n\r\ntotal sum of $2,715,000 was approved by Parliament\r\n\r\nfor  urban and rural services. This sum,  however,\r\n\r\nis  very  small compared to the total  Development\r\n\r\nBudget  of  some  $249  million,  i.e.,  the   sum\r\n\r\nappropriated for urban and rural services was only\r\n\r\njust  over  one per cent of the total  Development\r\n\r\nBudget. Yet in spite of this, the sum approved was\r\n\r\nfurther  cut down sometime in the middle  of  this\r\n\r\nyear  to some $1,900,000. No reason was given  for\r\n\r\nthe cut and no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt  hon.

But one\r\n\r\nper cent of the total Development -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, could you speak a little\r\n\r\nslower  because  the  Interpreters  are  having  a\r\n\r\nlittle difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> But one per cent of the total\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Budget for urban and  rural  services\r\n\r\ncan,  by no stretch of the imagination, be  called\r\n\r\nextravagant.  Indeed,  in  the  debate  last  year\r\n\r\nMembers  appeared to lament the smallness  of  the\r\n\r\nsum appropriated for urban and rural services. If,\r\n\r\nin spite of this and in spite of the fact that the\r\n\r\nsum  was approved by Parliament, it is further cut\r\n\r\ndown, there must be cogent reasons for this and we\r\n\r\nwish to know the reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Development Budget, a total sum of\r\n\r\n$2,715,000  is  allocated under  15  items.  These\r\n\r\nitems range from agricultural and kampong roads to\r\n\r\nroadside  trees and shrubs; and to each  of  these\r\n\r\nparticular  items, a definite sum is allocated.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to know whether these allocations have  been\r\n\r\nrigidly  observed or whether the Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices Committee or the Projects Committee  have\r\n\r\nthe  discretion of altering the allocations so  as\r\n\r\nto   take  account  of  the  requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies as a whole. As far as  I  can  see,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the urban and  rural  services\r\n\r\nprojects have been effectively carried out by  the\r\n\r\nUrban and Rural Services Committee. It is true, no\r\n\r\ndoubt, that now and again there are complaints  of\r\n\r\ndelay.  But, in my opinion, such delays are  bound\r\n\r\nto  happen in view of the vast programme for which\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  is responsible. In  this  respect,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish to thank the Committee for  carrying\r\n\r\nout the projects so efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, however, there is a change in the\r\n\r\nadministrative  structure of the Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee.  There is  created  over  and\r\n\r\nabove the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  another Committee called  the  Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee. It has never been explained why such  a\r\n\r\nnew Committee becomes necessary at this particular\r\n\r\njuncture, or what are its precise functions in the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the urban and  rural  services\r\n\r\nprojects. All we know is that it appears  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  last  say in the approving of projects.  With\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of  this  Projects  Committee,  all\r\n\r\nprojects  will  now  take a, longer  time  to  get\r\n\r\napproved.  Before  the creation  of  the  Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the  final decision  rested  with  the\r\n\r\nUrban  and  Rural  Services  Committee.  With  the\r\n\r\ncreation   of  the  Projects  Committee,  projects\r\n\r\napproved by the Urban and Rural Services Committee\r\n\r\nwill now have to be approved again by the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee before they can be implemented. Is  this\r\n\r\nadditional level of decision really necessary?  To\r\n\r\nmy  mind,  it is not. It only wastes the  time  of\r\n\r\nmembers  of  both the Committees  and  delays  the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of  urban  and, rural   services\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt hon. Members of this House will also\r\n\r\nwish  to  know  on  what  criterion  the  Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee  bases its decision in approving  or  in\r\n\r\nrejecting  projects. Before the  creation  of  the\r\n\r\nProjects  Committee,  when  the  Urban  and  Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee had the final say, members  of\r\n\r\nthe U.R.S.C. (meaning the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee) made site visits to acquaint themselves\r\n\r\nwith the conditions of the particular constituency\r\n\r\nin  which  projects  were to be  implemented.  The\r\n\r\nProjects  Committee does not make such visits.  It\r\n\r\nis known to have cut down projects arbitrarily and\r\n\r\nto  have approved and implemented projects against\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation  of the Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House two examples from my own\r\n\r\nconstituency. In Yew Tee Village in the  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang constituency, there is no piped water and the\r\n\r\nwells  get  dry during the dry season.  The  Water\r\n\r\nWorks  Department, after extensive investigations,\r\n\r\nrecommended  a  three-phased  project  costing  in\r\n\r\ntotal some $140,000. The first and second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphases each cost $46,000. After due consideration,\r\n\r\nthe  Citizens' Consultative Committee in Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,    with   my   support,   recommended    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of phase two which  could  be  done\r\n\r\nindependently of the other two phases at a cost of\r\n\r\n$46,000. This recommendation was rejected  by  the\r\n\r\nProjects Committee allegedly on the ground that it\r\n\r\nwas not economical. On the other hand, there was a\r\n\r\nproject  for  street lighting of  Tengah  Village,\r\n\r\nalso  in  my  constituency, costing some  $16,000;\r\n\r\nthis   project  was  supported  neither   by   the\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee of Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nnor  by  me,  but it was approved by the  Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee and has now been implemented. This state\r\n\r\nof  affairs  is causing a great deal of  confusion\r\n\r\nand  no  small  amount of dismay in the  minds  of\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament and members  of  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees. Members of Parliament are\r\n\r\nlargely  concerned with deciding on the priorities\r\n\r\nof competing needs in their constituencies, guided\r\n\r\nby  the  advice  of  their Citizens'  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees.  Generally,  therefore,   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  should  have  a  large  say   on   the\r\n\r\npriorities  of  projects for their  constituencies\r\n\r\nand their recommendations should be respected, in\r\n\r\nthis  connection,  perhaps the Projects  Committee\r\n\r\nshould consider the procedure of asking the Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament concerned to appear before it  when\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  decides on the projects  affecting\r\n\r\nthe particular M.P.'s constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rather surprised that the Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\nproject for bringing water to Yew Tee Village  was\r\n\r\nrejected by the Projects Committee because it  was\r\n\r\nnot  economical. Yet, at the same time, a  project\r\n\r\nfor street lighting not supported by me nor by the\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee was approved. How\r\n\r\ncan  the  Projects Committee explain its  decision\r\n\r\nthat the water project was not economical and  yet\r\n\r\nthe street lighting project was economical? And if\r\n\r\nprojects  are  approved and rejected  on  economic\r\n\r\ngrounds, when has this criterion come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout?   Can  the  decision  for  social   service\r\n\r\nprojects  be  based on economic grounds?  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  a  categorical statement from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to the detailed administration of the\r\n\r\nurban  and  rural  services projects,  at  present\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees  are  asked  to\r\n\r\nhelp  search  the records at the Land Registry  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the  ownership  where  projects  affect\r\n\r\nprivate  land. I am of the opinion  that  this  is\r\n\r\nimposing  too  heavy  a burden  on  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committees, a burden  they  are  not\r\n\r\nequipped  to  shoulder. Members of  the  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative   Committees  are   local   community\r\n\r\nleaders.  They are sensitive to the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies  but  they do  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nworkings  of the Land Registry and the  making  of\r\n\r\nsearches  of  the records kept there. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe Citizens' Consultative Committees are asked to\r\n\r\nobtain  the owners' permission where any  projects\r\n\r\naffecting private land are considered. This  again\r\n\r\nI  consider to be quite inappropriate. It would be\r\n\r\nmore  effective  if the Urban and  Rural  Services\r\n\r\nCommittee  could  obtain the  private  landowner's\r\n\r\npermission  after ascertaining that any particular\r\n\r\nproject affects private land. All urban and  rural\r\n\r\nservices  projects  are for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and the community should not be held  to\r\n\r\nransom  by  private landowners. It is more  likely\r\n\r\nthat permission would be given when sought for  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments rather than  by  community\r\n\r\nleaders  who have no official status, at least  in\r\n\r\nthe  eyes of the private landowners. In the  event\r\n\r\nof   private  landowners  being  unreasonable   in\r\n\r\nholding  up projects which would benefit  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people,  I  would  suggest  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should consider exercising  powers  of\r\n\r\nacquisition  under  the existing  law  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall,  let  me  praise  the  Government  for  their\r\n\r\nachievements in the past few years, especially  in\r\n\r\nthe field of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrural  development. This is in  keeping  with  our\r\n\r\npolicy  and  is  inseparable from  our  policy  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  rural areas. We  implement  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes in order  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the masses of the rural  people  so\r\n\r\nthat  these people, who were neglected by the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew   Hock   Government  and   by   the   colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment,  can  now  enjoy modern  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving. Sir, although the rural development  plan,\r\n\r\ntaken  as a whole, has achieved much, I feel  that\r\n\r\nwe  should go a step further and develop the rural\r\n\r\nareas  and not to cut down on the expenses  of  or\r\n\r\nslow down the rural projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards what the Member for Choa Chu Kang has\r\n\r\nsaid,   namely,  that  the  amount  of  $2,700,000\r\n\r\nallotted  for rural development has been cut  down\r\n\r\nto  $1.9  million, I also feel that  this  is  not\r\n\r\nproper  and  right.  I  would  like  to  make  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  Firstly,  on the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nprojects,  I feel that the authorities responsible\r\n\r\nfor the various projects are not doing their best.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, when certain projects are  approved\r\n\r\nby  the  Urban  and Rural Services  Committee,  it\r\n\r\nusually takes about a year or more for the work to\r\n\r\nget started. Secondly, I feel that it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a  system  of  supervision  over  the\r\n\r\nprojects, because in many places the work has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  properly  done. For instance, in  Sembawang,\r\n\r\none  or two months after Kong Loong Road was  made\r\n\r\nup, there were big holes in it. This shows clearly\r\n\r\nthat  there had been malpractices in the  building\r\n\r\nof this road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the setting up of the Projects Committee\r\n\r\non  top of the Urban and Rural Services Committee,\r\n\r\nI  think  it may not be too important. If  such  a\r\n\r\nCommittee can make the U.R.S.C, more effective, it\r\n\r\nis quite all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I fully support and subscribe to\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments expressed by the Member  for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  that  the rural people  were  not  only\r\n\r\nneglected during the colonial days, but  they  are\r\n\r\nalso neglected now. I can prove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis in this House on the ground that we were  not\r\n\r\nable to win the support of the rural people in the\r\n\r\nlast general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Whether we win the elections in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas the next time depends not so much  on\r\n\r\nfigures  but on each and every one of you and  how\r\n\r\nyou work in your constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Money is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is important, and we are giving\r\n\r\nthem  more  money.

I wish he had\r\n\r\ndrawn  this  to  my  attention  earlier,  so  that\r\n\r\ninvestigations can proceed into whether there have\r\n\r\nbeen rnalpractices, in the sense that the work had\r\n\r\nnot  been  done according to contract, or  whether\r\n\r\nsome  big lorries which pass there night  and  day\r\n\r\nbroke up the road soon after it was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the Member for Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\nin  whose  name  this motion stands.  He  wants  a\r\n\r\ncategorical statement from the Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nexplaining  why  a  scheme  for  electricity   was\r\n\r\napproved  in  his  constituency  and  a  suggested\r\n\r\nproject for water supply was rejected. The  answer\r\n\r\nis  simple. Choa Chu Kang is allocated $77,952 per\r\n\r\nyear.  The Member for Choa Chu Kang, supported  by\r\n\r\nhis Citizens' Consultative Committee, wants us  to\r\n\r\nspend  more than half that amount on a water  main\r\n\r\nwhich,   according   to  investigations   of   the\r\n\r\nU.R.S.C.,  will be supplying water to 50 families:\r\n\r\nthe  whole  project  to be done  in  three  phases - first  year,  $46,000; second year, $46,000.  The\r\n\r\nProjects  Committee  had  already,  at  the   same\r\n\r\nmeeting,  approved a water main project for  Choa.\r\n\r\nChu Kang to the tune of $23,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking  $23,000  from $75,000,  he  is  left  with\r\n\r\n$52,000. If  we had approved $46,000 for  another\r\n\r\nwater main, then work on all other projects in his\r\n\r\nconstituency would have stopped. So does  he  want\r\n\r\nto  spend  all  his funds on 50  families  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency, or does he want to divide this money\r\n\r\nproportionately and fairly in various parts of his\r\n\r\nconstituency? If we had more money, we would  give\r\n\r\nit  to  him.  But  finance is  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, and I asked him half an hour\r\n\r\nago  what I should say to the Member for Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang in case he raised this point again, that  not\r\n\r\nenough  money  is being spent on urban  and  rural\r\n\r\nprojects.  The  answer was a definite  `No'.  \"The\r\n\r\nState  has  got  no  more money  to  give  to  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\" In fact, under the  Second  Five-Year  Plan, Government has made provision for  $12\r\n\r\nmillion  for  these projects. This  works  out  at\r\n\r\nroughly  $2.5  million  per year.  But  Parliament\r\n\r\nactually  approved $2.7 15 million for this  year.\r\n\r\nThis amount is small compared with the Development\r\n\r\nBudget.  But these are necessarily small  projects\r\n\r\ncompared  with the other projects in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  correct  to say  that  this  original\r\n\r\nprovision of funds approved by Parliament has been\r\n\r\ncut  down  by the Projects Committee. The Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee has no power to cut down what Parliament\r\n\r\nprovides.   What   actually   happened    was    a\r\n\r\nreadjustment  of  the  allocations  done  by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance at the request of the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain items which come under the\r\n\r\nheading  \"U.R.S.C.\"  in the Development  Estimates - like  private  streets,  minor  improvements  and\r\n\r\nreconstruction  of  roads, roadside  railings  and\r\n\r\nfencing,  footpaths  and  cycle  tracks,  roadside\r\n\r\ndrains,  roadside  trees  and  shrubs.  The  total\r\n\r\namount  for these items is roughly $795,000.  When\r\n\r\nmaking   the   original   allocation   for    each\r\n\r\nconstituency,  this  Committee  did  not  consider\r\n\r\nthese  items. These items are usually done by  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. If they are building a cycle track, they do\r\n\r\nnot build it in Tanglin and stop within the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstituency.  They  have got  to  go  on  to  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.  And  if they build it in Choa  Chu  Kang,\r\n\r\nthey   will  probably  proceed  on  to  the   next\r\n\r\nconstituency. So these items, for which money  was\r\n\r\nbeing spent by the P.W.D., had not been taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration  by  the Finance  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Planning  Unit.  And  when   this   was\r\n\r\ndiscovered, they had to calculate again and  fresh\r\n\r\nfigures   were   given   for  each   constituency,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  apparently  less  money  for   each\r\n\r\nconstituency.  But the facts are that  the  monies\r\n\r\nspent in each constituency were not reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> For building cycle tracks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am prepared to give way, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. Get up, Mr Tang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, surely the\r\n\r\npoint  is  that the Member of Parliament  for  any\r\n\r\nparticular constituency is the best judge of  what\r\n\r\nare  the requirements of that constituency. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  up to the P.W.D, to build, say, a cycle track\r\n\r\nalong  Choa  Chu  Kang and extend  it  to  Jurong.\r\n\r\nPossibly both Choa Chu Kang and Jurong do not want\r\n\r\ncycle  tracks.  Choa Chu Kang, for example,  wants\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the question of social services should not\r\n\r\nbe  based on economic grounds. A social service is\r\n\r\nnot  a trade or a business. Therefore, the urgency\r\n\r\nand  the  importance  of the requirement  must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into account. The Projects Committee should\r\n\r\nnot  just  be allowed to say that street  lighting\r\n\r\nshould  be  installed in Tengah Village  and  then\r\n\r\nproceed  to spend $16,000 there, when at the  same\r\n\r\ntime  the  people  in Choa Chu  Kang - in  Yew  Tee\r\n\r\nVillage  - do  not have drinking water.  The  wells\r\n\r\nthere dry up during the dry season and water carts\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  used to bring water to rural  folks.\r\n\r\nSurely  in  this  case  the Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nconcerned  must have the discretion,  even  if  it\r\n\r\nmeans that half of the funds allocated to him goes\r\n\r\nto this particular project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I think you have made your\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am merely citing an example. If the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  will  look  at   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, he will see that  money  is\r\n\r\nprovided for various items. If he wants water  and\r\n\r\nnothing  else, I suggest he start next  year.  And\r\n\r\nthe  first item he asks for recommendation in Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang is this water main project. If he thinks\r\n\r\nthat  the  Projects  Committee  turned  down   his\r\n\r\napplication  arbitrarily, I would  invite  him  to\r\n\r\nthink  again. He speaks very well of the  U.R.S.C.\r\n\r\nwhich  is  under  my Parliamentary Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps he will be a little surprised to know that\r\n\r\nthe  U.R.S.C. rejected his application,  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Projects Committee just put its rubber  stamp\r\n\r\non the application that had already been rejected.\r\n\r\nWe accepted the recommendation of the U.R.S.C. for\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Choa Chu Kang has the highest\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has again criticised the setting up of the\r\n\r\nProjects  Committee and wants to know why  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen set up. The Projects Committee was set up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister because of many  a  complaint\r\n\r\nreceived from people like the hon. Member  to  the\r\n\r\neffect   that  Members  of  Parliament - his   own\r\n\r\ncolleagues  - who are members of the U.R.S.C. only\r\n\r\nrecommended  projects in their own constituencies.\r\n\r\nI  am not saying that that was true. But that  was\r\n\r\nthe   impression  created  - that  members  of  the\r\n\r\nU.R.S.C, only    looked   after    their    own\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Because  of  these  grouses   and\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from other Members of Parliament,  the\r\n\r\nProjects Committee, headed by me as Chairman,  was\r\n\r\nset up to process these applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Member that 98 per cent of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the U.R.S.C. are  accepted  by\r\n\r\nmembers of the Projects Committee. And let me also\r\n\r\nassure  him that whatever happens in the  U.R.S.C.\r\n\r\nmeetings  is also known to members of the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee,  because  some  persons  are  on   both\r\n\r\nCommittees.   Some  Members  of  Parliament   have\r\n\r\nappeared  before the U.R.S.C. The Member for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  says that the Projects Committee  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime.  I say that it is a waste of time to hear  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament twice. If the U.R.S.C, has\r\n\r\ngiven him a hearing, I do not see why the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee should give him another hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly, the Projects Committee makes its\r\n\r\ndecisions  on the recommendations of the  U.R.S.C.\r\n\r\non  the  availability  of funds  and  whether  the\r\n\r\nproposals  are  in  conformity  with  the  overall\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans and policies of the Government.\r\n\r\nWhat  really  astounds me  is  that  a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament can get up in this House and  say  that\r\n\r\nhe wants to spend half the money allocated for his\r\n\r\nconstituency on 50 families and damn the rest.  It\r\n\r\nis for that reason that the Projects Committee was\r\n\r\nset  up  to  look  into  recommendations  made  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Citizens' Consultative Committees\r\n\r\nand   Members  of  Parliament.  All  in  all,  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations are good, but we have  got  to  be\r\n\r\ncareful. We have got to process them and to decide\r\n\r\non  them. But if you are allocated $80,000 and you\r\n\r\nwant to spend more than half on a pipeline for  50\r\n\r\nfamilies,  it  will be very difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\nagree and to accept your recommendation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Choa Chu Kang, up till\r\n\r\nSeptember this year a sum of $81,000 was spent  in\r\n\r\nhis  constituency. In other words, the funds  have\r\n\r\ndisappeared.   His  constituency  is   not   being\r\n\r\nneglected.  We  have overspent in  Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nwithin  the first nine months of the year, and  he\r\n\r\nwants us to spend another $46,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned the question of land\r\n\r\ntitles. There is a little history behind this  and\r\n\r\nI  think,  Sir,  I  can put the facts  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  In  the  past, Members of  Parliament  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Citizens' Consultative Committees\r\n\r\nmade recommendations to build roads, put up street\r\n\r\nlights, and what - have - you -- not caring on whose\r\n\r\nland  the  project was to be developed.  This  had\r\n\r\nraised  complications. There  had  been  howls  of\r\n\r\nprotest from landowners; and rightly too. If I own\r\n\r\na  piece  of land and next morning I find  a  road\r\n\r\nright  through  it,  I will  write  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. The Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoa Chu Kang has passed his Bar examinations  and\r\n\r\nI hope he has not forgotten the law of trespass! I\r\n\r\nam  sure many a client goes to him seeking  advice\r\n\r\non what they can do and what remedies they have in\r\n\r\nthe  High Court -perhaps an injunction or  perhaps\r\n\r\ndamages  for trespass. These are the actions  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has had to face  because  of  the\r\n\r\nindiscretions of Members of Parliament and members\r\n\r\nof  the Citizens' Consultative Committees. Some of\r\n\r\nthese  actions are still being considered and  are\r\n\r\nstill in the files of the Attorney-General.  If  I\r\n\r\nhave a piece of land, you have got no right to put\r\n\r\na  drain right through it. And if you have a piece\r\n\r\nof  land, I have got no right even to step on  it.\r\n\r\nSo  to  suggest  that  we  ignore  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nlandowners   is,  under  our  law,  an  impossible\r\n\r\nproposition. I would suggest that when we  rewrite\r\n\r\nour Constitution, and if the Member still believes\r\n\r\nthat  we should go in arbitrarily and build  roads\r\n\r\nand  community  centres,  lay  pipes  on  somebody\r\n\r\nelse's  land,  then let him take it up  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  should the Constitution be  there,  and\r\n\r\nset  out his arguments. But until the law has been\r\n\r\nchanged,  I  am afraid that we cannot in  any  way\r\n\r\nflout  it without exposing the Government  to  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  action for trespass, interference,  and\r\n\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But  I  never suggested  anything  like\r\n\r\nflouting  the  law. In fact, if the Minister  will\r\n\r\nrecall,  I did say perhaps in necessary cases  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  power  of  acquisition   under   the\r\n\r\nexisting law should be exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I did not suggest that it was the\r\n\r\nMember  for Choa Chu Kang who has made suggestions\r\n\r\nthat  we  should trespass on other people's  land.\r\n\r\nBut if you remember, I said that I had to give you\r\n\r\na  little  history of how these points  developed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Projects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee was formed, its first decision was  that\r\n\r\nany  projects  could not and  would  not  even  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  until the landowner's  permission  was\r\n\r\nforthcoming. But this led to a howl of protest and\r\n\r\nit  is  for this reason that I am raising it  here\r\n\r\nand  making  it  clear once and for  all  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot   flout   our  own  land   laws.   As   for\r\n\r\nacquisition,  we  are always acquiring  land.  And\r\n\r\nthere have been allegations that my Ministry would\r\n\r\nsoon  become one of the biggest landowners in this\r\n\r\ntown.  We  are very careful when we acquire  other\r\n\r\npeople's land. For major road widenings, yes.  But\r\n\r\nif  you want to build an agricultural road, surely\r\n\r\nyou  do  not want the Government to acquire  land.\r\n\r\nBut  we  do  acquire  land for road  widening  and\r\n\r\nmaking  of new roads. But if every time the  owner\r\n\r\nrefuses  to give permission for us to acquire  his\r\n\r\nland  and  we  acquire  it, this  would  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  a  big  packet  and  the  land   would\r\n\r\nprobably  not be worth acquiring. To suggest  that\r\n\r\nit  is  better  for the U.R.S.C. to write  to  the\r\n\r\nlandowner  in  the first instance I would  say  is\r\n\r\nwrong.  We have done it - to quote a case in  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  where  the Member for  Upper  Serangoon\r\n\r\nwanted a road metalled. We advised him to write to\r\n\r\nthe  landowner,  which he did. The landowner  said\r\n\r\nno.   So  the  Projects  Committee  wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nlandowner and the reply was to this effect:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At the moment I am having a lot of trouble\r\n\r\ntrying  to  get rid of squatters on  my  land.  To\r\n\r\nbuild  this road would only make the stay  of  the\r\n\r\nsquatters more permanent. When I have got  rid  of\r\n\r\nall  these  squatters,  I  will  build  this  road\r\n\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  there are always two sides to the question and\r\n\r\nit is not for the Government to acquire a piece of\r\n\r\nland  to build a road on someone else's land where\r\n\r\nsquatters  have been sitting for years.  We  would\r\n\r\nrather  not  interfere in civil  disputes  between\r\n\r\nlandlord and tenant. Sometimes it is the landowner\r\n\r\nwho  is at fault. Sometimes it is the tenant.  But\r\n\r\nthe  solution is not to acquire the land  for  the\r\n\r\nmaking up of a road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing further to add, Sir, except this.\r\n\r\nIf  any Member of Parliament is not satisfied with\r\n\r\nany decision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Projects Committee, I suggest that he file\r\n\r\nor   petition   for  a  reconsideration   of   the\r\n\r\napplication - perhaps asking for more pipes - and  I\r\n\r\ncan   assure  him  that  the  Projects  Committee,\r\n\r\ninstead of arbitrarily rejecting the appeal,  will\r\n\r\nonce  again give it careful consideration - and  if\r\n\r\nit  appears  that the decision was  wrong,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that  the Projects Committee  is  big\r\n\r\nenough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto withdraw its decision and approve the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six minutes past Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">14th November, 1967.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
