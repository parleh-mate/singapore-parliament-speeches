Member to  the  two  joint\r\n\r\ncommuniques  and  statements  issued  during   the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  our  tour. If he would read  them,  he\r\n\r\nwould  discover  that  they refer  to  discussions\r\n\r\nbeing conducted in a \"friendly atmosphere and in a\r\n\r\nspirit of mutual understanding\" and that there now\r\n\r\nexisted  favourable conditions, according  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunique   \"for   the  promotion   of   mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial  relations based  on  understanding  in\r\n\r\nmany  spheres,  particularly in the  economic  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  fields\". Though  our  visit  to  these\r\n\r\ncountries  took  place at a time  when  they  were\r\n\r\npreoccupied  with  the winding  up  of  the  Arab-Israeli conflict and receiving an unending  stream\r\n\r\nof  more  distinguished  visitors,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation  was  warmly received, entertained  and\r\n\r\nafforded  generous time for discussions with  very\r\n\r\nbusy Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second part of the question,\r\n\r\nthe   personal  contacts  with  Arab  leaders  and\r\n\r\nofficials  enabled  the  Singapore  delegation  to\r\n\r\nclear  doubts and misunderstandings in  regard  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  stand  on  issues  which  the   Arabs\r\n\r\nconsider  crucial. It is my view - which is  borne\r\n\r\nout  by  the  two joint communiques  -  that  such\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings  as may have  existed  have  now\r\n\r\nbeen cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visit also enabled us to learn directly from\r\n\r\nArab  leaders  of  their  political  and  economic\r\n\r\naspirations  and  in  what  way  these  could   be\r\n\r\nassisted through co-operation with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussions brought to surface the large\r\n\r\nareas  of  ignorance the Singapore and West  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries   had  as  regards  potentialities   for\r\n\r\neconomic  cooperation. I should,  however,  stress\r\n\r\nthat much of Arab aspirations in the economic  and\r\n\r\ntechnology  fields would be met by the  major  and\r\n\r\nwealthier  industrial countries.  However,  during\r\n\r\nthe  course of our discussions the leaders of West\r\n\r\nAsia   thought  there  were  residual  areas   for\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial cooperation between Singapore\r\n\r\nand the oil-rich countries of West Asia. Like many\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwary  of becoming too dependent economically on  a\r\n\r\nfew  industrial nations. The leaders of West  Asia\r\n\r\nwere  unaware, until it was pointed out  to  them,\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore had some expertise in such  things\r\n\r\nas port development, public housing, banking, ship-repairing,     shipbuilding     and     industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  which  would  be  more  relevant  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries because Singapore itself  was\r\n\r\na developing country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third part of the question,\r\n\r\nthe  scope for improvement of relations with  West\r\n\r\nAsian  countries will depend largely on  ourselves\r\n\r\nand  our entrepreneurs. We cannot expect the  West\r\n\r\nAsian  countries to court Singapore  because  they\r\n\r\nhave more suitors than they can cope with and with\r\n\r\nfar  more to offer. It is, therefore, up to us  to\r\n\r\ntake the initiative and convince the countries  of\r\n\r\nWest Asia that mutually beneficial relations could\r\n\r\nbe developed with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection I am happy to note that our\r\n\r\nChambers  of Commerce, industrialists and  bankers\r\n\r\nare organising a trade mission to visit West Asian\r\n\r\ncountries to study and explore prospects. However,\r\n\r\nthis  should  be  supplemented  by  exchanges   of\r\n\r\ncultural missions and promotion of tourism between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  West Asian countries  which  quite\r\n\r\nregrettably our citizens are inclined to bypass on\r\n\r\ntheir way to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, would the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider  the  setting  up  of  a   more\r\n\r\npermanent  office in that part of West Asia,  such\r\n\r\nas an embassy, so that continuity of what has been\r\n\r\nestablished  can be maintained, and  it  can  also\r\n\r\nhelp  them  utilise and invest the expected  US$50\r\n\r\nmillion which they get from their oil trade?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, my Ministry has always\r\n\r\nconsidered such matters.

And in order to do justice to  a\r\n\r\nsubject of public interest, the answer would also\r\n\r\nhave to be reasonably long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first assure the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kallang that if it is in the  public\r\n\r\ninterest to do so, I would have no hesitation  in\r\n\r\nwithdrawing the licence of Singapore Bus  Service\r\n\r\nLtd  (SBS). But I do not believe it would  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  public interest to do so now. Other measures\r\n\r\nwould serve the public interest better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS began operations about four months ago. It\r\n\r\ntook  over the assets and services of the  former\r\n\r\nthree  bus  companies  -  Amalgamated  Bus   Co.,\r\n\r\nAssociated Bus Services and United Bus  Co.  With\r\n\r\nthe assets also came many problems. For instance,\r\n\r\nit  inherited  a  bus fleet, on paper,  of  2,000\r\n\r\nbuses of which over 400 were broken down and laid-up.  This  fleet also comprised no less  than  17\r\n\r\ndifferent makes. Many of the buses had also  been\r\n\r\nrepaired,  in the past, using non-standard  parts\r\n\r\nor  parts cannibalised, or \"transplanted\" as  the\r\n\r\nMember worded it, from other buses. In the  past,\r\n\r\nthere was much duplication of routes and services\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  depot locations  of  the  three\r\n\r\nformer  bus  companies and to allow each  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  companies a fair share of  the  profitable\r\n\r\nand unprofitable routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the starting up of operations by SBS and to\r\n\r\nensure the efficient management and operation  of\r\n\r\nthe   sole   public  bus  service,  a  tripartite\r\n\r\ncommittee  was formed. This is the  Bus  Services\r\n\r\nReorganisation  Committee  (BSRC)  made   up   of\r\n\r\nofficials from the Ministry of Communications and\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Vehicles, the Managing Director  of\r\n\r\nSBS  and  the  General Secretary of  SILO,  which\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  bus  workers.  The  BSRC   meets\r\n\r\nweekly,  monitoring  the operations  of  SBS  and\r\n\r\nsetting  the  targets for the bus  management  to\r\n\r\nattain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal immediate tasks of BSRC are: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To get the 400 buses now not in service\r\n\r\nrepaired  and  put back on the road,  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  SBS  has  contracted  this  work  to  a\r\n\r\nprivate  firm  of motor repairers to be  completed\r\n\r\noriginally by April at an estimated cost  of  $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion,    excluding   replacement    of    major\r\n\r\ncomponents,  of  which SBS has on  order  227  new\r\n\r\nengines, gear boxes and rear axles costing another\r\n\r\n$2 million. Owing to the number of different makes\r\n\r\noperated, a comprehensive range of spare parts for\r\n\r\nall the laid-up buses is not available. Only 45 of\r\n\r\nthe  400  laid-up buses were repaired  up  to  4th\r\n\r\nMarch.  Now  it  does not appear likely  that  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  the 400 buses will be repaired  until\r\n\r\nmuch   later  than  April.  The  situation  should\r\n\r\nimprove  when  the major components on  order  are\r\n\r\ndelivered.  To  speed  up  the  work,   SBS   will\r\n\r\nundertake some of the repair work itself with  the\r\n\r\nnew  personnel it would be employing and temporary\r\n\r\nrepair  facilities that are now being provided  at\r\n\r\nthe  existing depots. In addition, SBS has invited\r\n\r\nother private motor repairers to contract for some\r\n\r\nof the repair work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To improve the standard of maintenance of the\r\n\r\nbuses.  This  involves setting up a Central  Depot\r\n\r\nand  Workshop on a 17-acre site at Braddell  Road,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  leased  from  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board for 15 years. This Central Depot\r\n\r\nand   Workshop  is  to  be  properly  staffed  and\r\n\r\nequipped. Building plans are now being put  up  by\r\n\r\nSBS'  architects, assisted by workshop consultants\r\n\r\nfrom   major   motor  assemblers,  repairers   and\r\n\r\nsuppliers. Under-operation of buses, through  poor\r\n\r\nstandards  of  maintenance,  has  been  a  serious\r\n\r\ndefect.  The  following financial  penalties  were\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the  three former bus companies  over\r\n\r\n1972  and  1973, before the formation of SBS,  for\r\n\r\nunder-operation of services: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          ABC         $ 46,000\r\n\r\n          ABS         $ 73,800\r\n\r\n          UBC         $ 126,350\r\n\r\n                      ---------\r\n\r\n                      $ 246,150\r\n\r\n                      =========\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  SBS has provided a performance  bond  of\r\n\r\n$500,000,   it  is  not  intended  to  exact   any\r\n\r\nfinancial  penalty  for under-operation  of  buses\r\n\r\nuntil  after sufficient time has elapsed  for  all\r\n\r\nthe  400 laid-up buses to be repaired and put back\r\n\r\non the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To require SBS to undertake a faster\r\n\r\nreplacement  programme of old  buses.  This  would\r\n\r\ninvolve  the  purchase of a minimum of  1,000  new\r\n\r\nbuses  over  the next three years,  400  of  which\r\n\r\nwould  be replacements for old buses over 12 years\r\n\r\nold,  and 600 would be as additions to the  fleet.\r\n\r\nThis   would   cost  an  estimated  $65   million,\r\n\r\nincluding interest charges. Between November  last\r\n\r\nyear  and end of February this year, SBS purchased\r\n\r\nand  put  into operation a total of 152 new  buses\r\n\r\ncosting $8.4 million, which increased the carrying\r\n\r\ncapacity of its fleet by 11,100 passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures required of SBS to improve the\r\n\r\npublic  bus  service involve investment  of  large\r\n\r\nsums  of  money.  SBS started  operations  on  1st\r\n\r\nNovember last year, with a paid-up capital of  $11\r\n\r\nmillion  and  net assets (i.e, net book  value  of\r\n\r\nbuses  less  hire  purchase  obligations)  of  $30\r\n\r\nmillion. The net asset value was determined  by  a\r\n\r\nprofessional firm of management consultants,  SGV-Goh   Pte  Ltd,  in  September  last  year  in   a\r\n\r\npreliminary  valuation  for  purposes  of  initial\r\n\r\nallotment  of shares in SBS to its three component\r\n\r\ncompanies - ABC, ABS and UBC. The consultants were\r\n\r\ncommissioned by the three bus companies  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair standard of service would require assets\r\n\r\nof  some  $90  million. No one would  invest  such\r\n\r\ncapital if there is a certainty of losses  and  no\r\n\r\nreturns. Had the old bus fares, in existence since\r\n\r\nApril  1971, not been revised from 10th  February,\r\n\r\nSBS  would have headed for substantial losses.  It\r\n\r\nwould  have  ended up like the Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several conditions have to be satisfied by SBS\r\n\r\nin  consequence  of  the bus fare  revision  being\r\n\r\nallowed: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To provide better terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice for its 9,000 workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  implementing, in full, recommendations made by\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages Council (NWC), from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.  Also, the provision of adequate rest rooms,\r\n\r\ncanteens  and  toilet facilities at all  main  bus\r\n\r\nterminals  for its workers, which are  practically\r\n\r\nnon-existent at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As SBS is operating an essential public,\r\n\r\nservice,  its  profits,  if  any,  should  not  be\r\n\r\nunrestricted  and at the expense of  lowering  the\r\n\r\nstandard of service. Accordingly, its annual  pre-tax  profits  for the first three years  would  be\r\n\r\nlimited  to  a maximum of 8 per cent  of  its  net\r\n\r\nassets  (i.e, net book value of buses  less  hire\r\n\r\npurchase   obligations)  as  certified  by   their\r\n\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Should annual pre-tax profits exceed the\r\n\r\nlimit of 8 per cent, the surplus would be ploughed\r\n\r\nback  for the purchase of yet more new buses, i.e.\r\n\r\nSBS would have to embark on an even faster rate of\r\n\r\nreplacement than that mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bus Services Licensing Authority Act was\r\n\r\namended  effective as from September last year  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  an  Inspector  to  be  appointed  to\r\n\r\ninspect  the  affairs of SBS,  if  necessary.  The\r\n\r\nreport of the Inspector could be published  if  it\r\n\r\nis  in  the public interest to do so. I would  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to use these powers if the management  of\r\n\r\nSBS  is  found  to be abusing their positions  and\r\n\r\nsacrificing the public interest. So far, the  need\r\n\r\nhas  not  arisen.  I  am  monitoring  developments\r\n\r\nclosely in conjunction with the BSRC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the intention to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the licence of SBS, establish a statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation, and take over its functions. I am not\r\n\r\nsure  what  the  hon. Member  refers  to  when  he\r\n\r\nmentions \"other public transportation systems\". If\r\n\r\nhe is referring to school buses, taxis, etc, may I\r\n\r\nsay  that there are 1,860 registered school buses,\r\n\r\n350  of  which are under the NTUC Comfort  Scheme.\r\n\r\nThere  are  5,004 taxis, 1,225' of which  are  in.\r\n\r\nNTUC  Comfort.  And up to 9th March,  a  total  of\r\n\r\n1,135  Adult  Worker Contract (AWC)  permits  were\r\n\r\nissued to 959 school buses and 176 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoods and other vehicles to provide transport  for\r\n\r\nworkers.  Public Transport licences issued  up  to\r\n\r\n9th March to vehicles participating in Scheme B of\r\n\r\nthe Supplementary Public Transport Service, number\r\n\r\n290,  of  which 267 were for school buses and  the\r\n\r\nremainder for goods and other vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for the Government to carry out\r\n\r\na valuation of SBS assets. A preliminary valuation\r\n\r\nhas  been  carried out by the firm of professional\r\n\r\nmanagement  consultants for initial allocation  of\r\n\r\nshares,  as  stated  earlier.  A  full  and  final\r\n\r\nvaluation  will  be completed by  this  firm.  Any\r\n\r\nreputable  firm  of consultants  that  produces  a\r\n\r\nfalse valuation can be prosecuted, besides loss of\r\n\r\noperating privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that accounts for part (d) of\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member's Question. Parts (e), (f) and (g)\r\n\r\nwould  require no answer, since I have replied  to\r\n\r\npart   (c)   in  the  negative.  The  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  is  to get SBS to institutionalise  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  its management, and not to  set  up  a\r\n\r\ncorporation to take over the public bus operations\r\n\r\nor   to  invite  others  to  participate  in  this\r\n\r\ncorporation.  There is no magic in nationalisation\r\n\r\nof  the bus services. What must be done to improve\r\n\r\nbus  services is to enable a reasonable return  on\r\n\r\nits  net assets, professional management not based\r\n\r\non  family or clan relationships, proper servicing\r\n\r\nand   maintenance  of  buses,   fair   wages   and\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  bus workers in  return  for  safe\r\n\r\ndriving and courteous service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part (h) of the hon. Member's Question about\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  an efficient mass  rapid  transit\r\n\r\nsystem  has been answered by me in this  House  on\r\n\r\n4th March in response to a similar question by the\r\n\r\nhon.   Member  for  Kim  Keat.  The  position   is\r\n\r\nunchanged.  I may add that action to  improve  the\r\n\r\npublic   bus  service  cannot  be  successful   in\r\n\r\nisolation At the same time, we have to resolve the\r\n\r\nincreasing   traffic  congestion  on  our   roads.\r\n\r\nGreater  priority has to be given to the needs  of\r\n\r\npublic   transport,   to   pedestrians   and    to\r\n\r\npreservation  and enhancement of our  environment.\r\n\r\nThe problem we face is one faced by all big\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncities   with  high-rise  buildings.   Since   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of  the Central  Business  District\r\n\r\n(CBD),  the number of people going to work in  the\r\n\r\nCBD  has  increased more than five times, but  the\r\n\r\nroads  have expanded less than two times to  cater\r\n\r\nfor the cars, taxis and buses that take people  to\r\n\r\nwork  at  peak hours. A recent count by  the  Road\r\n\r\nTransport  Working Group showed that about  30,000\r\n\r\ncars  go  into the CBD between 7.30 am, and  9.30\r\n\r\na.m. - just two hours - and of these, one half are\r\n\r\nmotorists commuting to work carrying an average of\r\n\r\n1.3 passengers per car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Road Transport Action Committee (RTAC)\r\n\r\ncomprising  the  Permanent  Secretaries   of   the\r\n\r\nMinistries      of      National      Development,\r\n\r\nCommunications,  Home Affairs and Finance  (Budget\r\n\r\nand  Development Divisions) was set up in November\r\n\r\nlast year. This Committee is charged with the two-fold task of: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) according high priority to the public bus\r\n\r\nservice; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) adopting various traffic management measures\r\n\r\nto reduce the present congestion on our streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following traffic management schemes have\r\n\r\nbeen introduced: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As from January this year, Government and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  have started staggered  working\r\n\r\nhours  for their staff, for a trial period of  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  So  far,  the response from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector to appeals by the Finance Ministry to  also\r\n\r\nadopt    staggered   working   hours   has    been\r\n\r\ndisappointing.  The private sector should  respond\r\n\r\nmore   effectively  to  help  spread  peak  period\r\n\r\ntraffic and so ease congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The insurance industry has creditably\r\n\r\nresponded to the call from Government to save fuel\r\n\r\nduring  the  present world oil crises. Car  owners\r\n\r\nparticipating  in car pools would not  have  their\r\n\r\ninsurance  policies invalidated under the  present\r\n\r\nterms  of  these  motor  insurance  policies.  Car\r\n\r\npooling  will save fuel. More important,  it  will\r\n\r\nalso ease traffic congestion. In this respect,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  Principal  of  the  Methodist\r\n\r\nGirls'   School   in  Sophia   Road   is   to   be\r\n\r\ncongratulated. It was reported in the press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently that from 1,000 cars previously  used  to\r\n\r\ncarry pupils to and from her school daily, she has\r\n\r\nsuccessfully, through the enthusiastic support  of\r\n\r\nparents, reduced this number to 300 by promoting a\r\n\r\ncar  pooling scheme. If one school can reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of cars by 700, or more than two-thirds, 10\r\n\r\nschools could reduce the number of private cars on\r\n\r\nthe  roads by 7,000 daily through similar schemes.\r\n\r\nSo  if  employers, trade unions and others in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector followed the example of MGS,  there\r\n\r\nwould be an immediate easing of traffic congestion\r\n\r\nduring peak periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A widespread system of reserved bus lanes\r\n\r\nwhich began with Robinson Road and parts of Market\r\n\r\nand  Cecil  Streets on 6th February.  Those  along\r\n\r\nStamford  and Bras Basah Roads came into operation\r\n\r\nfrom  22nd February, and the next would  be  along\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road,  Penang  Road,  Somerset  Road  and\r\n\r\nOrchard Boulevard as from tomorrow, 15th March. By\r\n\r\nthe  end of June, more than 20 busy streets in the\r\n\r\nCentral Business District would have reserved  bus\r\n\r\nlanes  to  accord public buses the  priority  they\r\n\r\ndeserve   in  order  to  move  expeditiously   and\r\n\r\nunhindered by other traffic in limited road space.\r\n\r\nWe are also providing more and wider pavements for\r\n\r\npedestrians  and  kerbside  bus  stands  for   bus\r\n\r\ncommuters, wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Increasing restraints on private cars. As\r\n\r\nreserved  bus  lanes  come  into  operation,  many\r\n\r\nexisting  kerbside parking lots will be abolished.\r\n\r\nIn  particular,  restrictions  would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nimposed  on  private  cars  entering  the  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness  District  during  peak  hours.  I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned in my reply to the hon. Member  for  Kim\r\n\r\nKeat  on 4th March that a plan is now being worked\r\n\r\nout  for fringe parking of private cars going into\r\n\r\nthe  CBD  and commuting in special buses into  the\r\n\r\nCBD.   The  plan  will  be  published  for  public\r\n\r\ndiscussion    and   all   practical    suggestions\r\n\r\nincorporated before implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me assure the hon.

I  quote  further\r\n\r\nfrom the same speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But what happens when the Government\r\n\r\nnationalises  a  company which  has  not  yet  got\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised management, and corruption on  a\r\n\r\nscale  rampant  in  the former Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany  inevitably  results?  Let  us  first  get\r\n\r\nmanagement  and services improved through  tighter\r\n\r\nsupervision from the Ministry of Communications.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comes my set of questions. Can it be implied\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not  against the philosophy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  nationalise the  SBS?  Can  it  be\r\n\r\nimplied also that there is a nagging fear that the\r\n\r\npresent SBS management is corrupt, and will it  be\r\n\r\nmore  corrupt if the Government were to take over,\r\n\r\nlock, stock and barrel? Will it bring ruination to\r\n\r\nthe  bus  service?  If the Port  workers  were  to\r\n\r\nbehave   in   this  way,  it  would  be   treason.\r\n\r\nTherefore, will the Government take such behaviour\r\n\r\non the part of the management of SBS as treason?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much productivity and leisure hours of the bus\r\n\r\ntravelling public is wasted. Will the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications stop nursing and molly-coddling the\r\n\r\nSBS? Does he think it imperative that the views of\r\n\r\nthe   bus  travelling  public  be  sought  if   an\r\n\r\nefficient and cheap bus service is to be  operated\r\n\r\nby the State?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is, if the Government is not\r\n\r\nwilling  to take over the rights and interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  SBS,  may  I know whether the  Government  is\r\n\r\nwilling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto establish a corporation, wholly or partly owned\r\n\r\nby the Government, to compete with the SBS?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the logical explanation for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's decision to spend millions of dollars\r\n\r\non  the  cable car system, which is  not  a  daily\r\n\r\nnecessity, or on the construction of golf  courses\r\n\r\nwhich are beyond the means of the ordinary working\r\n\r\npeople,  when  it is not prepared  to  finance  an\r\n\r\nessential  service like the bus service,  although\r\n\r\nit  is  able  to do so? This is beyond reason.  We\r\n\r\nhave a lot of reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister believe that the bus service\r\n\r\nwill  be ruined to a point where it would be wiser\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to leave the management of the\r\n\r\nbus company to the owners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister want us to believe that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no financial resources?  Where  are\r\n\r\nour reserves? Since the Government was prepared to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  extent of lending its  assistance  in\r\n\r\ngetting  local as well as international banks  and\r\n\r\nfinance  companies, and also the Development  Bank\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, to bolster the SBS,  why  does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not consider doing so for a  statutory\r\n\r\ncorporation?  Does the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nconsider  that the SBS, without even  a  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors   and   ruled  by  personal   and   clan\r\n\r\nrelationship, has far greater expertise  than  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can command?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one last question on the MRT.

They\r\n\r\nare  now  worse. If something is  to  be  done  to\r\n\r\nimprove  it, it will at the best fall into  a  bad\r\n\r\nstate again.

If the\r\n\r\nrunning of public transport service is rather  bad\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  therefore in  order  to  make  good\r\n\r\nprofit the travelling public can only expect  poor\r\n\r\nservice,  as is the case with the SBS  where  both\r\n\r\nservice and the supposed losses are bad, will  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications be able to say whether\r\n\r\nthe  operating losses are true and correct?

The Road Traffic  (Taxis  and\r\n\r\nBuses  -Maximum Rates of Hire) (Amendment)  Order,\r\n\r\n1974,  published on 9th February in the Government\r\n\r\nGazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 7 of\r\n\r\n1974   issued  under  that  Act,  authorises   the\r\n\r\nrevision effective from 10th February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons why the revision was necessary were\r\n\r\ngiven at length in my Ministry's Statements of 3rd\r\n\r\nand 20th February. Replies by the Secretary of the\r\n\r\nBus    Services   Reorganisation   Committee    to\r\n\r\neditorials, reports and letters in the Press  also\r\n\r\ndetailed  the  reasons. I am sure Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse would not wish to have them repeated here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the fare revision should have been\r\n\r\nallowed  when  the  bus  service  does  not   meet\r\n\r\ncommuter demands really begs the question. If  the\r\n\r\nold  bus  fares, which had been in  existence  for\r\n\r\nalmost  three years from April 1971, had continued\r\n\r\nunchanged,  and  there had  been  no  interim  $25\r\n\r\nmonthly  allowance per worker, and no increase  in\r\n\r\ndiesel fuels and other lubricants, spare parts and\r\n\r\ntyres, Singapore Bus Service Ltd. (SBS) would have\r\n\r\nhad  an  expected profit in the year ending  March\r\n\r\nthis  year  of  $133,000 but losses  in  the  year\r\n\r\nending  March 1975 and 1976 of $29.7  million  and\r\n\r\n$42.3     million    respectively.    In     these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it would be difficult to expect the\r\n\r\npublic  bus service to improve. No one will  throw\r\n\r\ngood money after bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projections of profit and loss, just quoted,\r\n\r\ncame from professional management consultants, SGV-Goh  (Pte)  Ltd,  who  were commissioned  by  SBS.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these projections were made in  November\r\n\r\nlast year and did not take into account additional\r\n\r\ncost  factors  arising later. These  cost  factors\r\n\r\nare: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the increasing fuel oil price which rose\r\n\r\nlast  December  and has gone up again  this  month\r\n\r\nfollowing  doubling  of the  crude  oil  price  in\r\n\r\nJanuary - SBS's fuel bill will be up this month by\r\n\r\n105 per cent as compared to pre-November 1973;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the increasing wage bill which went up in\r\n\r\nFebruary  following implementation of  an  interim\r\n\r\nwage  supplement of $25 per worker per  month  and\r\n\r\nwill rise still further in July when the NWC makes\r\n\r\nits   next  recommendation  -  SBS's  wage   bill,\r\n\r\nincluding CPF \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontributions and related items, went up  by  18  per\r\n\r\ncent as compared to pre-November 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New projections which take account of these\r\n\r\nadditional cost factors and an, annual  growth  in\r\n\r\npassenger trips of 4 per cent, as against 5.5  per\r\n\r\ncent  by SGV-Goh (Pte) Ltd indicate a loss to  SBS\r\n\r\nover the 15 months from April 1973 to June 1974 of\r\n\r\n$17.5   million,  if  the  three-year   old   fare\r\n\r\nstructure remained unchanged,.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the old fares were uneconomic is\r\n\r\ncorroborated   by   the  poor  response   to   the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Public Transport Service (SPTS).  Up\r\n\r\nto  6th February, in the three weeks during  which\r\n\r\noperators were invited to submit applications, few\r\n\r\napplications by bus owners and lorry  owners  were\r\n\r\nreceived. On 6th February an announcement was made\r\n\r\nthat  the  fares chargeable under the SPTS,  which\r\n\r\nwere  based  on  the public bus  fares  structure,\r\n\r\nwould be revised in line with the revision of  the\r\n\r\npublic  bus fares. Even after this increase,  only\r\n\r\n189   buses  and  134  lorries  have  joined  this\r\n\r\nsupplementary transport scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fair and reasonable that the public should\r\n\r\npay  to financially sustain the bus company or pay\r\n\r\nfor its capital infrastructure? The answer is that\r\n\r\nSBS  started operations with a paid-up capital  of\r\n\r\n$11  million  and net assets of $30 million  (i.e.\r\n\r\nnet  book  value  of buses less  outstanding  hire\r\n\r\npurchase   payments).  To  get  the  bus  services\r\n\r\nimproved  to fair standards to meet the  increased\r\n\r\npassenger  load would require net assets  of  some\r\n\r\n$90  million. No bus operator can be  expected  to\r\n\r\nsink  in this capital if they cannot see any  hope\r\n\r\nof even covering costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidies to help meet operating costs would not\r\n\r\nresult in the improvement of bus services. Capital\r\n\r\ninvestments of $65 million would have to be  made.\r\n\r\nAdult bus commuters are already subsidising school\r\n\r\nchildren  who travel on concessional 10-cent  flat\r\n\r\nrate   to   any  destination.  Indirect  subsidies\r\n\r\nthrough  exemption of diesel fuel  tax  and  other\r\n\r\ntaxes,  as has been suggested, would not have  any\r\n\r\nsignificant effect. Tax on diesel fuel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccounts  for  only 0.8 per cent  of  SBS's  total\r\n\r\noperating costs. Other taxes and licence fees make\r\n\r\nup  10.7 per cent. Together, they only account for\r\n\r\n11.5  per cent of the total operating costs. These\r\n\r\ngo towards general revenue to pay for making roads\r\n\r\nand  maintaining them, bus bays and shelters,  bus\r\n\r\ntermini,  etc.  Wear and tear by  buses  are  very\r\n\r\nheavy  on  surfaces  of  roads  and  termini.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  after  the  Singapore  Traction  Company\r\n\r\n(STC) packed up in December 1971, the former three\r\n\r\nbus  companies, now known as SBS, were allowed  to\r\n\r\ntemporarily  garage the SBS buses at the  National\r\n\r\nStadium  car park during the night. When  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  stopped  garaging  their  buses   there\r\n\r\nmonths later, it cost them $123,000 to make up and\r\n\r\nrestore  the surface of the car park worn  out  by\r\n\r\nthe buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that completes my answer to Question 3. I\r\n\r\nnow proceed to answer Question 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have stated that there will\r\n\r\nbe  no advantage in the Government taking over the\r\n\r\npublic bus services now operated by Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nService Ltd (SBS) which has been in operation  for\r\n\r\nonly four months. SBS has shown itself willing  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  targets and take such  measures  as  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   and  the  Bus  Services  Reorganisation\r\n\r\nCommittee  (BSRC) have asked. It should  be  given\r\n\r\ntime  to  settle down, tighten management, improve\r\n\r\nmaintenance and increase bus services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the question as posed by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  may  I point out that Singapore  Airlines\r\n\r\n(SIA)  is not a new airline but has developed  its\r\n\r\nmanagement and organisation over one quarter of  a\r\n\r\ncentury.   The  Government  has  been   associated\r\n\r\ndirectly with its management in the course of this\r\n\r\ndevelopment for many years. Our port has a history\r\n\r\nof  more  than  one century; in fact,  150  years.\r\n\r\nTelecommunications in. Singapore  goes  back  into\r\n\r\nthe last century. The Government has been involved\r\n\r\nin  the  management of these for many  years,  and\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  on  inherited  organisations  like  the\r\n\r\nOriental Telephone and Electric Company, Cable and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWireless Ltd, etc. In the case of shipping,  there\r\n\r\nis  local talent with the knowledge and experience\r\n\r\nto  operate a national shipping line. Shipping  is\r\n\r\nas  old  as  the history of Singapore.  There  are\r\n\r\nnumerous  shipping  companies in  Singapore  where\r\n\r\nexperience  in  operating  a  major  international\r\n\r\nshipping line can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the position with the public bus\r\n\r\nservices  is  different.  We  now  have  only  one\r\n\r\ncompany,  namely  SBS, operating  the  public  bus\r\n\r\nservices  with  a fleet of 2,000  buses.  All  the\r\n\r\nlocal  talent with experience in operating  public\r\n\r\nbus  services  is in SBS. Prior to November  1973,\r\n\r\nthere  were  three  bus companies.  None  of  them\r\n\r\noperated  more than 1,000 buses. Less  than  three\r\n\r\nyears   before  that,  there  were  11  companies,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  former Singapore Traction  Company\r\n\r\n(STC). Then, none of them was operating more  than\r\n\r\n170  buses, except for the STC which was operating\r\n\r\nabout 500 buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government were to take over the public bus\r\n\r\noperations,  it  would have  to  use  the  present\r\n\r\nmanagement of SBS. To do this effectively would be\r\n\r\na  problem with the existing manpower resources of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  No government  officer  has  had\r\n\r\nexperience of operating a bus company. The nearest\r\n\r\nto  such  a task is the officer in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed Forces, Transport  Division,  and\r\n\r\nthat  took a great deal of effort to build up from\r\n\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  ensure  that  SBS,  the   sole\r\n\r\noperator  of public bus services, must be properly\r\n\r\nmanaged   and  must  provide  adequate   essential\r\n\r\nservice. But it cannot be expected to do this when\r\n\r\nit  is  operating at a loss. Even before SBS began\r\n\r\noperations  on  1st November, 1973, I  established\r\n\r\nthe  Bus Services Reorganisation Committee (BSRC).\r\n\r\nThe  BSRC, under my personal supervision, receives\r\n\r\ndaily returns from SBS on the bus operations - how\r\n\r\nmany  buses were operating for the day,  how  many\r\n\r\nbuses  broke  down, how many are in the  workshop,\r\n\r\nhow much fare was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollected,  etc. In addition, monthly  reports  on\r\n\r\nthe  bus  operations, as well as monthly financial\r\n\r\nstatements, are submitted by SBS. As from November\r\n\r\nlast  year,  SBS  is  also  required  to  send  in\r\n\r\ncertified  quarterly financial reports. All  these\r\n\r\nreturns  and  reports  are analysed  and  studied.\r\n\r\nOfficers  of the Registry of Vehicles cross  check\r\n\r\nby  making personal visits to the depots from time\r\n\r\nto time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of all this is not only to monitor\r\n\r\nthe  progress of SBS and set the targets  for  its\r\n\r\nmanagement to attain, but also to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nrevenue it collects is properly spent. There is  a\r\n\r\nlimit  to  the return on its net assets in  buses,\r\n\r\nwhich  shareholders in SBS may  earn.  Supervision\r\n\r\nand  scrutiny are necessary to ensure that revenue\r\n\r\nand  expenditure are properly accounted  for,  and\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  no  wasteful  expenditure,   no\r\n\r\ncorruption,  no dishonesty. The Government  cannot\r\n\r\nallow  the management of the bus company any  fare\r\n\r\nrevisions   that   would  go  into   wasteful   or\r\n\r\nunjustified    expenditure   through   inefficient\r\n\r\nmanagement or corrupt practices. The management of\r\n\r\nSBS  would  be  improved and made organisationally\r\n\r\nefficient.  The BSRC and I intend to see  that  it\r\n\r\nwill stay so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, this supervision is giving a team of\r\n\r\nGovernment officers experience in detecting  flaws\r\n\r\nin  the  running of a public bus operation of  the\r\n\r\nscale  of  SBS. This body of supervisory men  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  the expertise to help ensure that  public\r\n\r\ntransport will be run efficiently, not at a  loss,\r\n\r\nnor allowed to exploit the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next three years, the job is for the SBS\r\n\r\nto  get  at  least 1,000 new buses on  the  roads,\r\n\r\nrepair  the  400  buses that are now  immobilised,\r\n\r\nkeep   all  under  regular  maintenance,   improve\r\n\r\ndriving  standards  for safety of  passengers  and\r\n\r\nothers   on   the   roads,   more   courtesy   and\r\n\r\nconsideration  by  conductors.  The  best  way  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this is through the BSRC. Nationalisation\r\n\r\nwill  create  more  problems  than  we  have   the\r\n\r\ncapacity at present to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmy supplementary question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  connected with Question No. 2, and I  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity to raise it then.
