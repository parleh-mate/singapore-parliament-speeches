Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I have your permission to take Questions 1 and 2 together as\r\n\r\nthey are both related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Thank you. The Singapore Government\r\n\r\noriginally  proposed  a  Multilateral  Trade  Finance  Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme  to  help  resolve the trade finance  problems  faced  by\r\n\r\nIndonesian   firms.    However,   the   G7   countries,    whose\r\n\r\nparticipation  is  vital  since they  are  the  largest  trading\r\n\r\npartners   of  Indonesia,  prefer  their  own  bilateral   trade\r\n\r\nfinancing schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th February 1998, then Minister for Finance Mar'ie\r\n\r\nMuhammad asked our Finance Minister Richard Hu to have Singapore\r\n\r\nlaunch  the Multilateral Trade Finance Guarantee scheme  on  our\r\n\r\nown.   On  2nd March 1998, then Minister for Trade and  Industry\r\n\r\nTunky  Ariwibowo  repeated  the request  to  our  Ambassador  in\r\n\r\nJakarta,  Edward Lee.  On 20th March, in Jakarta,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Trade and Industry Muhammad Hasan made the same request  to\r\n\r\nAmbassador Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these requests, Singapore decided to launch\r\n\r\na  Singapore-Indonesia Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee  (BTFG)\r\n\r\nScheme.   I  wrote to President Soeharto on 31st March informing\r\n\r\nhim   of  Singapore's  decision  to  establish  the  BTFG  after\r\n\r\nIndonesia and the IMF have reached an agreement on their  latest\r\n\r\nround  of negotiations.  He called me up in London on 2nd  April\r\n\r\nto thank Singapore for its decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTFG is a bilateral scheme to enhance confidence in\r\n\r\ntrade  financing transactions undertaken by banks in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThe  aim  is to help restore established trade between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore has no experience designing or operating a\r\n\r\ngovernment-sponsored trade finance guarantee scheme, we have  to\r\n\r\nstart cautiously and modestly.  Initially, the scheme will  only\r\n\r\nprovide  export  credit insurance for our  domestic  exports  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  After we have gained experience with the scheme,  we\r\n\r\nwill  expand  it  to  cover  retained  imports  from  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSingapore will use US$3 billion out of the US$5 billion that  it\r\n\r\nhas  earlier  pledged to Indonesia for its IMF package  to  back\r\n\r\nthis facility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will eventually expand the scheme further to cover\r\n\r\nexports through Singapore by Indonesia's trading partners who do\r\n\r\nnot  have  their  own  bilateral  export  credit  schemes.   The\r\n\r\nremaining  US$2 billion of the US$5 billion that  Singapore  has\r\n\r\npledged to Indonesia will be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptually, we have the following mechanism in mind.\r\n\r\nECICS Credit Insurance Ltd will administer the Scheme.  ECICS is\r\n\r\nan  unlisted public company that is in the business of  insuring\r\n\r\nSingapore  exports against risks of non-payment.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will select several banks operating in Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nbe  designated  as  Trade Finance Banks (TFBs).   We  will  also\r\n\r\nidentify  a group of Singapore exporters to participate  in  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian importers will approach one of the approved TFBs\r\n\r\nto issue a Letter of Credit for a sales transaction secured with\r\n\r\nan   approved  Singapore  exporter.   The  TFB  will  bear   the\r\n\r\ncommercial risk on this transaction.  The Letter of Credit  will\r\n\r\nbe  presented  to  the  Singapore-based bank  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nexporter.   Bank Indonesia will guarantee fully the  obligations\r\n\r\nof   the  TFB  to  this  Singapore-based  bank.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, in turn, counter-guarantees part of Bank Indonesia's\r\n\r\nobligations  under  the  scheme.  The Singapore  exporters,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore-based bank and ECICS will share in some of this  risk.\r\n\r\nThis  is necessary to ensure that each party in the scheme  does\r\n\r\ndue diligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the TFB fails to honour its obligation on the Letter of\r\n\r\nCredit  it has issued,  Bank Indonesia's unconditional guarantee\r\n\r\nwill apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will run for an initial period of two years or\r\n\r\nuntil  the Indonesian trade finance cycle is restored, whichever\r\n\r\nis  earlier.  However, the Government of Singapore reserves  the\r\n\r\nright  to  discontinue the Scheme in the event of  a  change  in\r\n\r\ncircumstances which renders it no longer relevant or valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Indonesian officials will meet to flesh out\r\n\r\nthe scheme soon.  I am unable to say now the exact date when the\r\n\r\nBTFG scheme will come into operation.  We will need some time to\r\n\r\nwork  out the procedures and rules to create an effective scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  will  achieve its objectives.  We are seeking  help  from\r\n\r\ninternational experts.  We know its importance for Indonesia and\r\n\r\nwill endeavour to get it going as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B.

I am of the view  that\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General has advised me very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the guarantee part, this comes under the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore (MAS).

I can assure the Member and also the other  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House  that we would do things in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitution. If there is a need to come to Parliament, we  will\r\n\r\ncome to Parliament.  There is no question about that.  There  is\r\n\r\nno difficulty in that.

The increase in arrests is\r\n\r\ndue mainly to more intensive enforcement action by the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cause for alarm.

They are a warning  to  potential\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants that they should not come  to  Singapore  as\r\n\r\nthere is no work for them and that the Police are alert.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that more illegal immigrants are arrested does not\r\n\r\nindicate a deterioration in the security situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor  March  1998, the number of illegal immigrants arrested  for\r\n\r\ncriminal  activities  was only 32.  The security,  and  law  and\r\n\r\norder situation in Singapore is firmly under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests of illegal immigrants demonstrate that the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  the  other  Home Team agencies  such  as  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration  and Prisons are, for the present, well-equipped  to\r\n\r\ndeal with this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, could the Minister\r\n\r\ncomment  on the adequacy of the current penalties to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe   various   immigration  offences:    overstayers,   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, syndicates who run such rings, and if they  are  not\r\n\r\nadequate, whether he intends to revise them in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the current penalties for most of\r\n\r\nthe offences under the Immigration Act are adequate.

While  the  Employment  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Workers Act provides for mandatory imprisonment  for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  offence, my Ministry has sought deterrent  sentences  on\r\n\r\nsome  first-time offenders.  This had resulted in  three  first-time  offenders  being sent to jail in 1997.  The  maximum  jail\r\n\r\nsentence  meted  out  was  100  weeks  to  a  proprietor  of   a\r\n\r\nconstruction  company  which  employed  more  than  100  illegal\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  The principal contractor of  that  particular\r\n\r\nwork  site  was  also  fined nearly $1.5 million.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthree   employers  of  immigration  offenders  had  been  caned.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  the increase in the number of  illegal  workers\r\n\r\narrested\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently,  the  penalties  are  still  adequate.

The number seems to\r\n\r\nbe  stabilising.   So  there is no cause for  concern  that  the\r\n\r\neconomic  incentive  is  attracting people  across  our  borders\r\n\r\nillegally  to  find jobs.

But just to answer him, those\r\n\r\nwho  enter  the country illegally to work, of course,  face  the\r\n\r\npenalties under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act  and  also\r\n\r\nunder  the Immigration Act.  In the case of foreigners who enter\r\n\r\nSingapore legally to work and had their work permit cancelled by\r\n\r\nthe  employer, they are given a special pass for a short period,\r\n\r\nduring which they should make preparations to leave the country.\r\n\r\nThe  understanding with the foreign worker is that he can remain\r\n\r\nin  Singapore so long as he holds a valid work permit.   If  his\r\n\r\nwork permit has been cancelled or revoked for other reasons,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  he  must  leave the country.

Does the Ministry  make\r\n\r\nany distinction for them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we understand that some of the\r\n\r\nforeign workers have to pay certain sums of money to the  agents\r\n\r\nin   their   home  country  in  order  to  make  the   necessary\r\n\r\narrangements   to   come  to  work  in  Singapore.    But   such\r\n\r\narrangements are completely beyond the control and influence  of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry.  The concern and arrangement of a foreign  citizen\r\n\r\nwith  a foreign agent is totally beyond our control.  For  those\r\n\r\nwho come to Singapore to work, they enter  on the condition that\r\n\r\nthey  can  only remain here so long as they have  a  valid  work\r\n\r\npermit and so long as the employer requires their presence here.\r\n\r\nThere is no promise that they will be here for the full duration\r\n\r\nof the two years for which we grant a work permit, because there\r\n\r\nis  no way that my Ministry can assure every foreigner who comes\r\n\r\nto  Singapore that his employer will have a job for him for four\r\n\r\nyears  or  six  years or whatever period of  time  that  he  has\r\n\r\nindicated.  It is entirely up to the foreigner whether to accept\r\n\r\nor  not  to accept the job offered by his employer in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf,  for  whatever reason, the employer is unable to retain  the\r\n\r\nforeigner in Singapore on a particular job that he has in  mind,\r\n\r\nthen  he has to cancel the work permit and the foreigner has  to\r\n\r\nleave  Singapore.  This is the risk of coming here and they  are\r\n\r\naware of the risk.  They have to be prepared to take this risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, for those workers whose employment\r\n\r\nhas been prematurely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterminated and should they find a job within two weeks, will his\r\n\r\nMinistry consider favourably giving them a work permit?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, our approach towards the non-traditional source workers coming here to look for work is that\r\n\r\nthey must have prior approval before they enter Singapore.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who  are here, once their work permit is terminated,  and\r\n\r\nunless  there  are very exceptional circumstances,  they  should\r\n\r\nleave  the  country.  What we cannot afford to have  is  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  pool of non-traditional source workers hanging around  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  saying  they are looking for  work  and  seeking\r\n\r\nextension for their immigration permits in order to remain here.\r\n\r\nThey  are dragging the process over a long period of time, which\r\n\r\nmeans  that the number of such people hanging around and looking\r\n\r\nfor  jobs  will increase.  That will cause a lot of the problems\r\n\r\nthat  I have mentioned earlier on, ie, social problems, and  law\r\n\r\nand  order  problems.  How are they going to support  themselves\r\n\r\nwhen they are here looking for jobs?  What is there to guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  they will find a suitable job in two weeks?  In fact,  our\r\n\r\npolicy  has  always been that, for work permit applications,  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  a  foreign worker, you must apply for  prior  approval\r\n\r\nbefore  you  come  to  Singapore.

We have placement services to assist Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  retrenched  or who have lost  their  job  for  other\r\n\r\nreasons.  In the case of non-traditional source foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwho are in Singapore, we have had, in the past, on compassionate\r\n\r\ngrounds, tried to place some of those workers who were  in  fact\r\n\r\nasked  to leave by the employers. We found to our disappointment\r\n\r\nthat  our  efforts  were usually unsuccessful.   The  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers who could be successfully placed and the  number\r\n\r\nof  employers whom we could persuade to take up these  displaced\r\n\r\nforeign  workers were minimal. As a result, most of the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  had  to  go  back.  I think we  should  stick  to  this\r\n\r\nfundamental  policy  that they come to Singapore  to  work  with\r\n\r\nvalid  work  permits and with prior approval.  If, for  whatever\r\n\r\nreason,  the employer is unable to keep him in employment,  then\r\n\r\nhe will have to go back.  This is the risk that some of them had\r\n\r\npaid  money to come here and this has to be their own  look-out.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot assume that Singapore streets are paved  with  gold\r\n\r\nand  they  can come here and just continue to have a  good  job,\r\n\r\nearn  a high salary, and regardless of what happens, they  would\r\n\r\nbe able to remain here on various pretexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNDERGROUND WATER RESOURCES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  whether  the  Government has made  any  study  on  the\r\n\r\npossibility of using underground water resources in Singapore to\r\n\r\nsupplement our water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, Singapore's water supply comes entirely from  the\r\n\r\ncollection of surface runoffs from rainfall.

He  also\r\n\r\nstated  that  he would do his utmost to get his government,  his\r\n\r\npeople  and  those  in  the  private sector  to  understand  the\r\n\r\neconomic  costs and the health impact of forest fires and  haze,\r\n\r\nand   seek   their  cooperation  in  stopping  illegal   burning\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Environment Ministers also discussed the forest\r\n\r\nfires  raging in the East Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah,\r\n\r\nand  were briefed by the Malaysian Environment Minister on their\r\n\r\nefforts  to  bring  these  fires under control.   The  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinister informed us that many of these are peat fires,  against\r\n\r\nwhich conventional methods of fire fighting are not effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought in Kalimantan, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei has\r\n\r\nbeen particularly severe and prolonged, and rain is not expected\r\n\r\ntill the later half of this year.  The dry season in Sumatra  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  set in around the middle of this year.  Whilst  efforts\r\n\r\nare  being made amongst the affected ASEAN countries to  jointly\r\n\r\ntackle  the forest fires with international aid where available,\r\n\r\nat  home  we  have  been advising Singaporeans  to  install  air\r\n\r\ncleaners and special filters to mitigate the effects of haze  on\r\n\r\ntheir  homes, schools and offices.  We have tested these devices\r\n\r\nand found them to be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister: (1) what measures are being taken to contain the fires\r\n\r\nin  Kalimantan; and (2) is there any evidence of illegal burning\r\n\r\nin Sumatra?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, at the present moment, a team from\r\n\r\nUNEP, as well as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperts  from Germany, are in Kalimantan helping to  assess  the\r\n\r\nsituation.

Sir, fortunately,  Sumatra  is\r\n\r\npresently fairly free of fire, and that is why we have agreed to\r\n\r\nput the highest priority on maintaining the current situation in\r\n\r\nSumatra.    We   have  set  up  the  sub-regional  fire-fighting\r\n\r\narrangement  which will be organised to operationalise  what  we\r\n\r\nhad agreed upon in terms of cooperation to spot the fires and to\r\n\r\ndeploy  the necessary people to prevent those fires from  taking\r\n\r\nhold when they do break out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he does\r\n\r\nnot  consider it really a mockery to tell people, those who have\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient  funds even to meet their daily  expenses,  that\r\n\r\nthey should install air purifiers and cleaners in their homes to\r\n\r\navoid  any  health impact?  May I ask the Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has any plans to use some of the US$5  billion  that\r\n\r\nthey have set aside to help Indonesia to help the needy here who\r\n\r\nmay  be in need of respiratory equipment and other medical  aids\r\n\r\nto help them get over the haze problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, our attempt to advise Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwas  in  response to the appeals by Singaporeans for information\r\n\r\nof  what  action  they can take to mitigate the effects  of  the\r\n\r\nhaze.   Even  at the worst period last year, the  PSI  level  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  on a 24-hour basis, was in the region of about  138,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in  the  unhealthy region but not  in  the  hazardous\r\n\r\nregion, most Singaporeans really would be able to cope with  the\r\n\r\nhaze  without  any  equipment, such as  purifiers  and  filters.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for those Singaporeans who suffer from health problems\r\n\r\n-  the  asthmatics,  the elderly who are sick  and  who  require\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment  -  they can easily go  to  the  polyclinics.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  fees  in the polyclinics are already  very  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised,   but  for  those  people  who  require   additional\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  Medifund  which  can  then  help  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\npolyclinic  fees  in  full.   So there  is  no  reason  for  any\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  at  all to feel that they are  being  deprived  of\r\n\r\nassistance from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister, regarding\r\n\r\nthe  fires in Kalimantan last year and the haze which it caused,\r\n\r\nwas  it  not  known that a large percentage of it  was  actually\r\n\r\ncaused by illegal burning on large plantations?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in fact, the Indonesian Minister\r\n\r\nat  our  last ministerial meeting in Brunei had stated  that  he\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the  present fires in  Kalimantan  were  largely\r\n\r\ncaused,  in the initial stages, by illegal burning.  But because\r\n\r\nof  the  extreme  dryness of the island  due  to  the  prolonged\r\n\r\ndrought,  those fires have spread very rapidly into  the  nature\r\n\r\nreserves and other areas which are by and large uninhabited.  So\r\n\r\nin  terms  of the genesis, yes, the fire originally was  started\r\n\r\nlargely  by illegal burning but, however, the present  scale  of\r\n\r\nthe fires is caused largely by the prolonged drought.\r\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, could nothing be done then about\r\n\r\nillegal burning which is really the genesis of the fires?

The grant is treated as a housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy  enjoyed by the eligible recipient, in lieu of buying  a\r\n\r\nnew subsidised flat from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Government introduced the Executive\r\n\r\nCondominium (EC) Housing Scheme to meet the aspirations of young\r\n\r\ncouples, many of whom are graduates and professionals, who  want\r\n\r\nto own private homes quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage these couples to apply for an EC instead of\r\n\r\njoining the HDB queue, the Government decided in 1996 to  extend\r\n\r\nthe  CPF Housing Grant to first-timers buying an EC.  The  grant\r\n\r\nof $40,000 makes the ECs more affordable, since the grant can be\r\n\r\nused towards the 20% downpayment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the NMP's question: will the $40,000 CPF housing grant\r\n\r\nbe  extended  to  those who want to buy private properties,  the\r\n\r\nanswer   is   no.    Because   unlike  private   apartments   or\r\n\r\ncondominiums,  ECs  are  sold under the  conditions  of  the  EC\r\n\r\nHousing  Scheme  Act and Rules which have several  restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe  eligibility conditions are, however, similar  to  those  of\r\n\r\npublic  housing.  In addition, a purchaser is also subjected  to\r\n\r\nthe following conditions of ownership:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the purchaser must occupy the EC for the first five\r\n\r\nyears after taking possession of the EC;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the purchaser can only sell the EC after completion of\r\n\r\nthe  5-year occupation period, and from the 6th to the 10th year\r\n\r\nof  ownership, he can only sell the EC to Singapore citizens  or\r\n\r\nSingapore Permanent Residents; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the purchaser and spouse are permanently debarred from\r\n\r\nbuying subsidised public housing from HDB.  In other words, they\r\n\r\nare totally out of the public housing scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private apartments or condominiums, they are\r\n\r\nsold by private developers under very different conditions.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  control ownership  of  these  residential\r\n\r\nproperties  which  the  purchasers can  use  either  for  owner-occupation or for investment or for speculation.  The purchasers\r\n\r\nfor  private  residential properties are also  from  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome groups.  Hence, the Government has no plans to extend the\r\n\r\nhousing grant to purchasers of private properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the problem of housing shortage serious? It is not so\r\n\r\nserious.   The  waiting  time to book the  ECs  is  very  short.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is zero today.  With the completion of HDB's referral\r\n\r\nof  applicants on the Executive Flat (EF) queue to the Executive\r\n\r\nCondominium developers, 95% of all the ECs are now available for\r\n\r\nsale under the open category.  In other words, anybody who meets\r\n\r\nthe  housing conditions can apply to buy an EC.  Applicants  are\r\n\r\nnow  able  to  book an EC immediately at the launch  of  any  EC\r\n\r\nprojects.   Yew  Mei is on the market for buying and  Summerdale\r\n\r\nhas  just  been  launched last weekend.  For those  first-timers\r\n\r\nwishing to buy HDB flats, the average waiting time has also been\r\n\r\nlowered  from the previous 4.5 years to 2.5 years now.   If  the\r\n\r\napplicant is not fussy about location, he can get a 4- or 5-room\r\n\r\nflat in the West Zone at an average waiting time of 1.25 to  1.5\r\n\r\nyears which, I think, is a reasonable waiting time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, first-time couples today have many choices to own\r\n\r\ntheir own homes.  They can either buy a private property if they\r\n\r\nhave  the  means;  or they can buy a more restrictive  Executive\r\n\r\nCondominium with the CPF housing scheme; or they can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuy  a  HDB  flat  from the resale market with the  CPF  housing\r\n\r\nscheme; or they can apply for a new HDB flat.  Finally, there is\r\n\r\nthe  option to live with dad and mum, and that is the  option  I\r\n\r\nencourage most.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND MEMBERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statistics of profits/losses from investments)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chng Hee Kok\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.

Hence, after offsetting for  the  CPF\r\n\r\ninterest,  these  members do not have any net  realised  profits\r\n\r\navailable for withdrawal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 17 per cent of CPF investors incurred\r\n\r\nrealised  losses, even before offsetting for the  CPF  interest.\r\n\r\nOf  these,  76 per cent or about 56,000 members made  losses  of\r\n\r\nless than $1,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the depressed stock market has added to the poor\r\n\r\nperformance  of CPF members' investment.  It is also  noteworthy\r\n\r\nthat  CPF  members usually choose to invest on the  local  share\r\n\r\nmarket   themselves  rather  than  place  their   savings   with\r\n\r\nprofessional fund managers in the form of unit trusts  and  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement   accounts.

They also have relatively small balances to construct  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful portfolio of investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is therefore looking into the further\r\n\r\nrefinement  and liberalisation of the CPF Investment  Scheme  to\r\n\r\ngive  members  more  options to invest  with  professional  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers.  Members can choose from more fund managers  and  unit\r\n\r\ntrusts.  The fund managers of CPF-approved unit trusts will have\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility to diversify portfolios to  maximise  risk-adjusted returns for CPF investors.  In addition, the new  rules\r\n\r\nto  require greater disclosure of investment information by  the\r\n\r\nfund  managers will enable CPF investors to make better informed\r\n\r\ninvestment  choices.

CPF   members\r\n\r\nparticipating  in the Investment Scheme must, however,  exercise\r\n\r\nprudence  and  judgement in their investments.

We understand that some families require the\r\n\r\nservices of a foreign domestic worker and our policy is  not  to\r\n\r\ndeny Singaporeans of such service if they are able to afford it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is still a need to ensure that  the  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign domestic workers in Singapore remains manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households employ foreign domestic workers for a variety of\r\n\r\nreasons.   Some employ a foreign domestic worker to  look  after\r\n\r\nthe  aged  and handicapped, others to look after young children,\r\n\r\nand  yet others to attend to household chores or even to do  all\r\n\r\nof  these things.  We should not favour any particular household\r\n\r\nor  type  of work by exempting them from the levy or granting  a\r\n\r\nconcession.   The levy is a transparent pricing  mechanism  that\r\n\r\napplies  equally  to all employers.  Waiving the  levy  for  any\r\n\r\nparticular   group  of  employers  will  undermine  Government's\r\n\r\nefforts to manage the demand for foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out that a working woman who\r\n\r\nemploys  a  foreign domestic worker to look after a  handicapped\r\n\r\nfamily member is also entitled to the double tax relief from the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic worker levy.  Furthermore, the Government  has\r\n\r\nprovided  various tax reliefs and assistance to help handicapped\r\n\r\npersons and their families.  For example, the family member of a\r\n\r\nhandicapped person is entitled to claim a handicapped  dependant\r\n\r\nrelief  of $3,500 for the maintenance of the handicapped person.\r\n\r\nGovernment also provides other forms of assistance to  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations  which  provide  support  and  care   for\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons.  These include residential and respite care\r\n\r\ncentres,   hostels,  day  activity  centres  and  provision   of\r\n\r\ntechnical  aids  for  disabled persons.  We should  address  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the handicap-care from a total perspective rather  than\r\n\r\nsimply  waiving  the maid levy which would increase  households'\r\n\r\nreliance  on  maids and undermine the development of alternative\r\n\r\ncare systems.

Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Extradition Act in order to\r\n\r\nenable  the continuation of the system of extradition with  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Extradition Act allows the extradition of\r\n\r\nfugitives to and from \"foreign States\" and declared Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries.  Extradition vis-\ufffd-vis Hong Kong was on the basis  of\r\n\r\nthe provision on declared Commonwealth countries.  From 1st July\r\n\r\n1997,  Hong  Kong ceased to be part of the Commonwealth.   As  a\r\n\r\nSpecial Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina,  Hong Kong is no longer a Commonwealth State, nor is  it,\r\n\r\nstrictly speaking, a \"foreign State\" within the meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nExtradition Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enable extradition arrangements with\r\n\r\nterritories which have a special status such as Hong Kong, it is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary  to  amend the Act.   This  Bill  therefore\r\n\r\namends  the  definition  of  \"foreign  State\"  to  include   any\r\n\r\nterritory  specified in the new Third Schedule to the Act,  with\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore has an extradition treaty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the benefit of Members, let me say that the United\r\n\r\nKingdom has taken a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar approach on the ground that the Hong Kong SAR is  a  sui\r\n\r\ngeneris  entity  in international law.  Last  year,  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom made elaborate amendments to their Extradition Act  1989\r\n\r\nso  that its provisions pertaining to foreign States, designated\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries and colonies also applied  to  the  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  SAR.   We,  however,  have taken  a  simpler  approach  of\r\n\r\nwidening the definition of \"foreign State\" so that it covers not\r\n\r\njust states but also \"territories\" such as the Hong Kong SAR.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 45 of the Act\r\n\r\nto  empower the Minister, by order published in the Gazette,  to\r\n\r\namend, add to or vary the new Third Schedule when an extradition\r\n\r\ntreaty  between any territory and Singapore has come into  force\r\n\r\nor has ceased to be in force, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Third Schedule in the Bill sets out the\r\n\r\nterritories with which Singapore has an extradition treaty.  The\r\n\r\nSchedule  lists  the Hong Kong SAR of the People's  Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina.  Singapore and the Hong Kong SAR signed an Agreement  for\r\n\r\nthe  Surrender of Fugitive Offenders on 11th November last year.\r\n\r\nIt  will  enable  Singapore and Hong Kong to  surrender  persons\r\n\r\naccused   or   convicted  of  offences  committed   within   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  either  Party,  who  are  found   within   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  the  other,  subject  to  the  terms  of   the\r\n\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill is enacted and comes into force, Hong Kong\r\n\r\nwill  be gazetted under section 4(1)(b) of the Act as a \"foreign\r\n\r\nState\" for the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of  the\r\n\r\nExtradition (Commonwealth Countries) (Consolidation) Declaration\r\n\r\n(Chapter 103, Declaration 1) will be amended to remove Hong Kong\r\n\r\nfrom the list of declared Commonwealth countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my understanding of\r\n\r\nextradition  is  that it is dependent entirely on  statute.   My\r\n\r\nquestion to the Minister is that since Hong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKong is not a sovereign state, can it sign an extradition treaty\r\n\r\nwith  the  Republic of Singapore?  Unlike the UK,  we  have  not\r\n\r\namended our laws in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the extradition treaty signed between Hong Kong\r\n\r\nand  Singapore, may I ask the Minister whether  it  was  at  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  of  the  Hong  Kong government  or  was  it  on  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  initiative?   I would  like  to  further  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  are the criteria he would look  into  before  an\r\n\r\nextradition  treaty is signed between Singapore  and  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry.   In this respect, may I ask how many of the  countries\r\n\r\nin  ASEAN have signed extradition treaties with Singapore  other\r\n\r\nthan Thailand?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer to section 3 of our Extradition\r\n\r\nAct.  I note that in that section, English extradition laws  are\r\n\r\nincorporated  into our statute.  Section 3 puts into  effect  in\r\n\r\nour  Extradition Act all those foreign States which have  signed\r\n\r\nextradition  treaties  with  England  as  if  they  had   signed\r\n\r\nextradition  treaties  with  us.   Since  we  are   now   making\r\n\r\namendments  to  our Extradition Act, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  why he does not now also include the list  of  foreign\r\n\r\nStates  in the new  Third Schedule.  In the absence of the  full\r\n\r\nlist  of foreign States in our Extradition Act, we have to  look\r\n\r\nto  the  English Extradition Act to find out all  the  names  of\r\n\r\ncountries which have an extradition treaty with us by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe  said English Act.  This is quite inconvenient, to  say  the\r\n\r\nleast.   Would  the Minister consider putting the full  list  of\r\n\r\nforeign States in our new Third Schedule?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have noted the various points and\r\n\r\nquestions  raised  by  Mr Chiam.  As to  who  initiated  it,  my\r\n\r\nrecollection  is that there was a mutual desire  by  both  sides\r\n\r\nthat   the   arrangements,  which  previously  existed,   should\r\n\r\ncontinue.    In other words, it was in the interest on  the  law\r\n\r\nand  order  grounds  of both Hong Kong and  Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\narrangements,  which  had been in place for  extradition  before\r\n\r\nHong Kong became an SAR, should continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on whether they had the competence, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  they had the competence and there was no objection by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to which ASEAN countries have formal\r\n\r\nextradition   agreements,   the  position  is   that   we   have\r\n\r\nextradition arrangements with Malaysia and Brunei and  the  kind\r\n\r\nof   expeditious  arrangements  are  set  out  in  our  criminal\r\n\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the provision which he referred to concerning\r\n\r\nextradition  treaties  entered into by the  United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nother  foreign  countries, yes, before Singapore  separated  and\r\n\r\nbecame  independent,  the  United Kingdom  had  its  extradition\r\n\r\ntreaties with other countries which may have listed Singapore in\r\n\r\nits  scope  of operations.  It does not follow that, today,  all\r\n\r\nthose  arrangements automatically apply.  In  other  words,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government will have to carefully consider whether all\r\n\r\nthese  treaty obligations are automatically binding on us before\r\n\r\nwe  can  consider publication of the treaties.  So this will  be\r\n\r\ndone   periodically  by  the  Attorney-General's   Chambers   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with those countries concerned.  But I want to make\r\n\r\nthe  point  that it is not automatic that all those  extradition\r\n\r\narrangements will apply in each and every case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe the Minister has left out\r\n\r\none  point,  which is on the criteria for us to  enter  into  an\r\n\r\nextradition treaty with another country.  Also, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and Brunei, my reading of the law is that  extradition\r\n\r\ncan only be carried out when there is an extradition treaty.  If\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have an extradition treaty with Malaysia and Brunei,\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  force those governments to hand over a fugitive  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If the Member will recall I do not have\r\n\r\nthe  statutory provisions with me right now  there are statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions  for Malaysia and Brunei to provide for  this  and  I\r\n\r\nshall  be  happy, at a later occasion, to refer these  statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions to the Member.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the criterion for any extradition arrangements, not\r\n\r\nonly  for  Singapore, it is whether the two countries  concerned\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there  is a desire,  a shared desire,  that  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of law and order, it is mutually beneficial for  there\r\n\r\nto be an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreement  for  the reciprocal handing over of  fugitives.   But\r\n\r\nthat is a general principle.  There also has to be agreement  on\r\n\r\nthe  nature of offences which are known as extraditable offences\r\n\r\nand  also  on  who  are extraditable persons.   Sometimes  these\r\n\r\narrangements  are  easier to conclude when countries  have  very\r\n\r\nsimilar  legal  systems and procedures.   Where  countries  have\r\n\r\nrather distinctly different legal systems and procedures, it may\r\n\r\nbe  more  difficult to conclude.  So, the general  approach  is,\r\n\r\nfirst,  there must be a mutuality of interest that they want  to\r\n\r\nconclude these agreements and, secondly, flowing from that, they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  examine the legal provisions  whether  they  are\r\n\r\ncompatible or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.

Many could\r\n\r\nbe working part-time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic maids are female, work within the confines of\r\n\r\ntheir employers' home for 24 hours of the day, and except during\r\n\r\ntheir time-off, are isolated from the rest of society nearly all\r\n\r\nthe  time,  and depend on their employer for food  and  lodging.\r\n\r\nMaids are therefore more vulnerable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabuse by employers and their immediate family members, than  any\r\n\r\nother categories of employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employers have an obligation to treat their maids\r\n\r\nhumanly  and  decently.  The great majority of  employers  treat\r\n\r\ntheir  maids well, but a small minority behave as if their maids\r\n\r\nare slaves.   They get upset easily when their maids do not meet\r\n\r\ntheir expectations.  Some even physically abuse them. Maid abuse\r\n\r\ncould  be in the form of simple assault or causing serious hurt.\r\n\r\nSome  employers took advantage of their maids by outraging their\r\n\r\nmodesty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of maid abuse cases reported to the Police\r\n\r\nnearly  doubled, from 105 in 1994, to 192 in 1997.   Of the  192\r\n\r\nreported  cases  in  1997,  157 cases  were  substantiated  with\r\n\r\nevidence,  and appropriate actions had been or are  being  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  the  offenders.   Although the number  is  still  small\r\n\r\nrelative  to  the maid population in Singapore, we  should  curb\r\n\r\nsuch incidents before they get out of hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid abuse runs counter to Singapore's aspiration to become\r\n\r\na  gracious and civil society.  Abuse of foreign domestic  maids\r\n\r\ncan  also  damage  our  international reputation  and  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.     The recent case of Hartati, the Indonesian  maid,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  was  widely  reported in  the  Indonesian  media.\r\n\r\nJakarta  imposed a temporary ban on maids coming  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nfollowing that incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to designate certain offences in the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code to carry 1.5 times the normal maximum penalties,  if\r\n\r\nperpetrated upon a domestic maid (regardless of whether she is a\r\n\r\nlocal  or  a  foreigner) by the employer  or  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer's household.   This will signal clearly to employers of\r\n\r\ndomestic maids that the Government takes a serious view of  maid\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, these offences are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Hurt or Grievous Hurt (section 323, section 324 and\r\n\r\nsection 325) of the Penal Code;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Wrongful Confinement (section 342, section 343 and\r\n\r\nsection 344);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Assault or use of Criminal Force with intent to outrage\r\n\r\nmodesty (section 354); and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Insult of Modesty (section 509).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple hurt and outraging of modesty are the two most\r\n\r\ncommon   forms  of  maid  abuse.  These  two  offences  together\r\n\r\nconstitute about 92% of all cases in the last four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill creates a new section 73 in the Penal\r\n\r\nCode, prescribing that the maximum penalties for the offences  I\r\n\r\nhave listed would be 1.5 times what the offender would otherwise\r\n\r\nhave  been  liable for, when the victim is a domestic maid,  and\r\n\r\nthe  offender  is  the employer or a member  of  the  employer's\r\n\r\nhousehold.   For  example,  the  current  maximum  penalty   for\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  causing  hurt is 1 year's imprisonment,  or  up  to\r\n\r\n$1,000 fine, or both. The maximum penalty will become 1.5 years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment, or up to $1,500 fine, or both. Clause 2 will  also\r\n\r\nmake  any  attempt  to commit or abet these offences  punishable\r\n\r\nwith the enhanced penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Applicability of enhanced penalties</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the enhanced penalties will apply whether the offences\r\n\r\ntake  place inside or outside the employer's place of residence.\r\n\r\nThis is because the abuse need not necessarily take place within\r\n\r\nthe  four  walls of the employer's home.   Employer's  household\r\n\r\nwill be defined as family members of the maid's employer who are\r\n\r\nresiding  in  the same home as the employer and the  maid.    It\r\n\r\nwill  exclude  visiting relatives and friends, as  they  do  not\r\n\r\nexercise any authority over the maid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced penalties will also not apply in situations\r\n\r\nsuch  as  when  a maid's employer sends her to work  in  another\r\n\r\nhousehold,  say, his brother's home on an ad hoc  basis,  and  a\r\n\r\nmember  of that household, say, his brother, subsequently abuses\r\n\r\nher.    Of course, the employer should not have sent the maid to\r\n\r\nwork in his brother's home in the first place, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  is  against the Employment of Foreign Workers Act.     But\r\n\r\nshould  he  do  that,  the enhanced penalties  would  not  apply\r\n\r\nbecause  like  visiting relatives and friends, the brother  does\r\n\r\nnot exercise any real authority over the maid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the definition of domestic maid in the Bill, the\r\n\r\nenhanced  penalties  will  also not apply  to  part-time  maids.\r\n\r\nThis is because part-time maids maintain their network of family\r\n\r\nand friends, and are consequently less vulnerable to abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I first introduced the Amendment Bill in this House,\r\n\r\nI  have received feedback that some employers are concerned that\r\n\r\ntheir maids may exploit the special protection provided to  them\r\n\r\nunder  the  Amendment Bill to get out of their contracts  or  to\r\n\r\nspite  their  employers.   Let me assure Members  that  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to safeguard employers' interests against such  maids.\r\n\r\nPolice  will warn and, where appropriate, prosecute a  maid  for\r\n\r\ngiving  false information to a public servant, under  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode.   Foreign  maids who misconduct themselves stand  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  work  permit  and can also be debarred  from  working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Jurisdiction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magistrate's and District Courts are currently\r\n\r\nempowered,  under  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,   to   impose\r\n\r\nsentences  up  to  two  years'  and  seven  years'  imprisonment\r\n\r\nrespectively.   To enable these Courts to continue to hear  maid\r\n\r\nabuse  cases carrying the enhanced penalties, clause  2  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  provides for these Courts to continue to have jurisdiction\r\n\r\nover such cases and impose the enhanced penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is intended to send a strong signal to those\r\n\r\nemployers who have a tendency to abuse their domestic maids that\r\n\r\nwe take a very stern view against such abuse.   My Ministry will\r\n\r\ncontinue to monitor closely maid abuse trends after the enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties have been implemented. If necessary, we will take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadditional  measures  to tackle maid abuse, including  expanding\r\n\r\nthe situations when the enhanced penalties would apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Penal Code (Amendment)  Bill  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\npenalties for offences against domestic maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with growing affluence and the increase in dual income\r\n\r\nfamilies,  employing  women  foreigners  to  take  care  of  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  chores and to tend to our children or elderly  parents\r\n\r\nhas  become the trend in most families who can afford to do  so.\r\n\r\nEven  for  families  where the wife is not working  outside  the\r\n\r\nhome, having a maid to do housework and to take care of children\r\n\r\nor the elderly sick is fairly common as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, and sadly though, affluence does not bring about a\r\n\r\nrefinement  in character or behaviour of some Singaporeans.   In\r\n\r\nrecent  years, abuse of domestic maids, going by press  reports,\r\n\r\nhas become fairly common and there seems to be a worrying trend.\r\n\r\nThe  type  of abuses, as reported in the media, has also  become\r\n\r\nmore bizarre and cruel.  Abusers seem to be getting younger too!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also reported cases of false\r\n\r\naccusations being made against employers but such cases  are  in\r\n\r\nthe minority.  Those maids invariably did so to get out of their\r\n\r\ncontract  of  service  so that they may return  to  their  homes\r\n\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by and large, the majority of domestic maids are well\r\n\r\nbehaved and discharge their duties admirably.  They take a  huge\r\n\r\nload  off  their  employers, especially  the  career  women  and\r\n\r\nworking mothers.  There are also instances of domestic maids who\r\n\r\nhad  performed tasks beyond their call of duty and  helped  save\r\n\r\nthe lives and property of their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good employers are also happily in the majority and many\r\n\r\ngrateful and understanding employers have also regarded  trusted\r\n\r\nmaids as members of their own family and take good care of their\r\n\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this, it is still necessary for us to\r\n\r\narrest  the  rising  trend  of domestic  maid  abuse.   We  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  that domestic maids are human beings who are  forced\r\n\r\nto  offer  themselves  as maids because of  financial  hardship.\r\n\r\nThey leave behind their families to come alone to a strange land\r\n\r\nso that they may sustain their families at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic maids are not like those in regular jobs. They\r\n\r\nhave  no  co-workers  to turn to for help or emotional  support.\r\n\r\nThey are very much on their own to fend for themselves.  They do\r\n\r\nnot  work  regular hours as those in regular employment  do  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  cases of maids having to work literally 24  hours  a\r\n\r\nday.   They have also no homes to return to, to unwind like most\r\n\r\nof  us,  and  are  in  constant contact  with  their  employers.\r\n\r\nLastly,  they have no families to turn to for emotional support.\r\n\r\nAll  these make a domestic maid different from not only us,  but\r\n\r\nalso  other  foreign workers.  Domestic maids are cooped  up  in\r\n\r\ntheir employers' homes day-in-day-out.  They are totally cut off\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rest of the world, as it were.  If they  are  abused,\r\n\r\nthere  is no one on hand to help them.  It is for these  reasons\r\n\r\nthat  the  law must protect them and punish the guilty to  deter\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a perception, Sir, that offences against domestic\r\n\r\nmaids  are committed by male employers.  This is not so as there\r\n\r\nare  several cases of abuse committed by women employers,  their\r\n\r\nparents  or  children.   Domestic maids are  not  only  sexually\r\n\r\nabused,  they can be physically and emotionally violated.   Most\r\n\r\nof  these  incidences  of abuse seem to  be  reported  by  third\r\n\r\nparties,  and not by the maids themselves.  These maids  may  be\r\n\r\ntoo intimidated to do anything but suffer in silence as they may\r\n\r\nhave  been  put  in  fear  of  their  life  and  limb  and  even\r\n\r\nrepatriation,  if  they  dare  breathe  a  word  of  their  ill-treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to address the concern of some Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nfeel  that the enhanced penalties seem to favour domestic  maids\r\n\r\nmore  than abused wives.  This is not so and I do not think that\r\n\r\nthis  is even our intention.  Wives should not be compared  with\r\n\r\ndomestic maids as they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  a  special category of persons who enjoy the protection  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  and  they have a special role in our  society  as  our\r\n\r\npolicies  have  always been family-oriented.  Abused  wives  can\r\n\r\nseek  redress  in  the  Family Court by way  of  a  personal  or\r\n\r\nexpedited  protection order for herself, or a domestic exclusion\r\n\r\norder.   They  can  also  turn to their own  parents,  siblings,\r\n\r\nrelatives or friends readily for assistance to deal with violent\r\n\r\nor  abusive husbands.  They can also bring an end to such abuse,\r\n\r\nof course, ultimately by divorcing their husbands.  Maids do not\r\n\r\nhave this ready access or privilege.  Neither can they enjoy any\r\n\r\nother  protection because they do not know how to access it  and\r\n\r\ndo not have the financial means to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps in seeking to enhance the penalties for\r\n\r\noffences  against  domestic maids,  we  should  also  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to look into the penalties for offences  of  family\r\n\r\nviolence  as  well to see if they should also be brought  up  to\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in the\r\n\r\nwake  of  a spate of maid abuse cases in the last few months,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Penal Code is timely, necessary and consistent  with\r\n\r\nour  national effort, as the Minister himself said, to create  a\r\n\r\ngracious  and  caring  society.   No  one  can  object  to   our\r\n\r\nGovernment severely penalising employers who exploit their maids\r\n\r\nand treat them like indentured servants or domestic animals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of enhanced penalties for a specially\r\n\r\nvulnerable and defenceless category of victims is valid.  It  is\r\n\r\na  commendable  example of State-sanctioned protection  for  the\r\n\r\nparticularly  vulnerable  members of a  domestic  household.   I\r\n\r\nwould,  however,  take  the point further  and  argue  that  the\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill has not gone far enough and should be extended to\r\n\r\ninclude  enhanced  penalties for other vulnerable  victims  like\r\n\r\nspouses, young children, handicapped and elderly dependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me elaborate. The Amendment Bill sends an\r\n\r\ninconsistent  message on violence.  If it  is  valid  to  regard\r\n\r\ndomestic maids as a specially vulnerable category\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  victims  for protection, why leave out the other potentially\r\n\r\nhelpless  and  exploited  members in  any  household?  Does  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  feel equally compelled to also enhance  penalties\r\n\r\nfor  child abuses, especially sexual abuses of minors and  those\r\n\r\nwho are intellectually disabled?  Children are as vulnerable and\r\n\r\npowerless as maids in the hands of abusive parents.  What  about\r\n\r\nabuses of elderly dependants and spouses?  Why single out maids?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a consistent deterrent against domestic violence,\r\n\r\nregardless of who is the victim.  Chief Justice Yong Pung How in\r\n\r\nthe  recent annual Workplan seminar said that \"punishment policy\r\n\r\nmust be clear, predictable and coherent\".  I cannot agree more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me a punishment reflects a society's values about what\r\n\r\nit  considers  as unacceptable behaviour.  Our message  must  be\r\n\r\nconsistent.   Insofar as abuse of maids is an  act  of  domestic\r\n\r\nviolence, the same principle of enhanced penalties should  apply\r\n\r\nto  all vulnerable victims such as spouses, young children,  and\r\n\r\nthe  handicapped  or  elderly dependants.  In  this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nstress  that  injury need not simply be physical in nature,  and\r\n\r\nextreme   humiliation  is  certainly  a  form  of  psychological\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is the Amendment Bill highlights the\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy  and discrimination in the treatment  of  wives  and\r\n\r\ndomestic  maids.  With enhanced penalties only for maid  abuses,\r\n\r\nwe  may  end up with an iniquitous situation whereby, if  a  man\r\n\r\nbashed  up  his  wife he could get one year's jail,  but  if  he\r\n\r\ncommits  the same degree of violence on the maid, he  could  get\r\n\r\none-and-a-half time year's jail.  Why do we make  penalties  for\r\n\r\nwife  abuse lighter?  Will we end up condoning spousal  violence\r\n\r\nmore than maid abuse?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case of equal treatment of women as a whole and\r\n\r\nrespect for them.  Our Constitution provides for equality before\r\n\r\nthe  law;  any preferential treatment of one category of  women,\r\n\r\nthe  domestic maids, as opposed to an equally important category\r\n\r\nof women, the wives, will violate this principle and create more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresentment  against the law at its apparent lack  of  comparable\r\n\r\nprotection for local abused wives.  We need to remove or address\r\n\r\nthis discrepancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not address this two-tier punitive sanction, we\r\n\r\nare  in  danger  of  creating different classes  of  victims  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  violence and it would be unfair to potential  victims.\r\n\r\nIt  would  appear  that  the drafters  of  this  Bill  are  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  the sufferings of the domestic maids  than  the\r\n\r\npain  of abused wives.  I hope the amendment of this Bill  is  a\r\n\r\nstart  for  an  overall review of the sentencing  guidelines  on\r\n\r\ndomestic violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then we can clearly say to the community that domestic\r\n\r\nviolence  of any kind and to any helpless member of a  household\r\n\r\nis  wrong.   I do not think it is highly improbable one  day,  a\r\n\r\nviolent  employer, who is about to hit a maid in a fit of  rage,\r\n\r\nwill suddenly think twice and will deliberately choose to hit  a\r\n\r\nfamily  member  -  child,  spouse or elderly  parent  instead  - because  he  or  she  will  get away with  a  lighter  sentence!\r\n\r\nIndeed,  many wives may be compelled to claim that they  are  in\r\n\r\nfact  domestic  maids, in order to get greater protection  under\r\n\r\nthe law!  I am sure, Sir, that such an unintended consequence is\r\n\r\nnot  what  the  Government  has in mind  when  introducing  this\r\n\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue, which is related to this Bill which I\r\n\r\nthought I should bring up, is the recognition that the Amendment\r\n\r\nBill  is only an enabling legal tool.  It is a necessary measure\r\n\r\nbut  not  a  sufficient one to stop maid  abuse.   Other  social\r\n\r\npolicies must be established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important reason why abuse of domestic maids occurs,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  not  because  of  inherent  nastiness  of  Singaporean\r\n\r\nfamilies.   The  same person who treats his subordinate  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace   with  respect,  and  waitresses  or  other   service\r\n\r\npersonnel  outside the household, may abuse the  maid  at  home.\r\n\r\nThis apparent dichotomy in behaviour is due to the fact that our\r\n\r\nsociety  has  created  certain normative  standards  of  conduct\r\n\r\ntowards people we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeal   with   outside   our  household.   The  employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship  is  bound by many laws which establish  a  web  of\r\n\r\nmutual  obligations.  The State has created this web; otherwise,\r\n\r\nwe  would  have workplaces that resemble Dickensian  conditions,\r\n\r\nand workers' rights have gone a long way since the last century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we do not have a codified, formalised web of mutual\r\n\r\nrelationships  and  obligations  for  workers  in  the  domestic\r\n\r\nhousehold.   The  domestic  household  worker  should  have   no\r\n\r\ndifferent  rights  and responsibilities as a factory  worker  or\r\n\r\noffice  worker.  It is precisely because they do not,  and  that\r\n\r\ntheir  destiny  is subject to the whims and random  kindness  of\r\n\r\ntheir  employers.  Sir, we cannot leave such relational  harmony\r\n\r\nin a household to \"luck\" and ambiguous management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, we ask for greater deterrents against maid\r\n\r\nabuse;  on the other hand, we must institutionalise the  working\r\n\r\narrangements  of  maids.   There should  be  standard,  properly\r\n\r\ndrafted work contracts stipulating terms and conditions,  mutual\r\n\r\nobligations - no less than what governs the working relationship\r\n\r\nbetween a factory operator and the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry of Manpower to draft a standard\r\n\r\nemployment   contract  for  all  domestic  maids  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  nationality.  We should also consider  extending\r\n\r\nthe  Workmen's  Compensation Act and other  relevant  protective\r\n\r\nlegislation  for  gainfully employed people, to domestic  maids.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  only  some  embassies  out  of  concern  for   their\r\n\r\nnationals  who  work as maids, do so.  But we  would  like  some\r\n\r\nstandardisation.   And  more  important  than   legislation   is\r\n\r\nconsistent  enforcement of State sanctions on violations.   Laws\r\n\r\nare only effective when they are activated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are not enough, Sir. We also should have\r\n\r\neducation  programmes  to  educate families  about  relationship\r\n\r\ndynamics and potential conflicts which can arise when a stranger\r\n\r\nenters the family with all the attendant stresses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have countless programmes on parenting, on marital\r\n\r\ncounselling, etc.  Yet we have ignored the fact that a maid,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin the confined space and privacy of household, has not been\r\n\r\nconsidered as a member of the family, for natural reasons.   Yet\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have programmes to teach employers and maids how  to\r\n\r\nrelate.  Companies hold courses for supervisors to learn how  to\r\n\r\ndeal  professionally  with workers, but we  do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nemployers, like housewives, for example, need to learn the  same\r\n\r\nin dealing with their maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner we recognise the reality that domestic maids are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a permanent - and growing - feature of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety  (we have 100,000 of them now and there will be more,  I\r\n\r\nthink)  and  establish  a  professional relationship  with  them\r\n\r\nwithin the household, the better prepared we are as employers to\r\n\r\ntap  them as a valuable resource to help us cope with the double\r\n\r\nburden responsibilities of most Singapore families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Amendment Bill and I hope we take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to adopt a thorough and multi-pronged  approach  at\r\n\r\nall  levels  to  address domestic violence within  the  coherent\r\n\r\nframework of fair and appropriate sanctions for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing\r\n\r\nme  this  opportunity.  First, I rise to support the Bill.   The\r\n\r\nBill  is  timely.  The newspaper reports, both  in  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  and the New Paper, have highlighted the plight  of  these\r\n\r\nmaids,   especially  the  New  Paper.   Many  thought   it   was\r\n\r\nsensational  to  have this news but I think it was  a  reminder,\r\n\r\nSir, to Singaporeans at large that some members of our community\r\n\r\nare not being fair to these maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of our citizens treat their maids well,\r\n\r\nbut there is a small minority who think they literally own these\r\n\r\nmaids.   They require them to do all sorts of things.  With  the\r\n\r\nproposed  legislation,  this small group  is  well  warned  that\r\n\r\nshould they not change, they will meet the might of the law  and\r\n\r\nthe law will take all this into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many may think that this is a bit harsh, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink  so.   These  maids have come all the way  from  different\r\n\r\ncountries.  They have left their families;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are in a foreign country with different cultural milieu and\r\n\r\nthey  have  come  here because of economic  necessity  in  their\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  fact,  let us not forget when  our  forefathers\r\n\r\ncame,  they  too came in this condition to earn a  living  here.\r\n\r\nThese  maids have left their families behind, some of them  have\r\n\r\nyoung  children.   And instead of showing some  sympathy,  these\r\n\r\nperpetrators have in fact treated these maids with abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in earlier days, maids were a luxury. Only the rich\r\n\r\ncould  afford them.  They were the traditional \"black and white\"\r\n\r\nladies  who,  in  most cases, were regarded as  members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   And  they, in fact, had authority  of  the  family  to\r\n\r\npunish  errant children and many children regarded them as  good\r\n\r\nas  their parents.  Why have we shifted the position?   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  something  that we ought to ask  ourselves.   Has  our\r\n\r\nsociety  lost  its  compassionate  values?   Because  both   the\r\n\r\ntraditional  \"black and white\" ladies and these  ladies  do  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing.  It is necessary for parents that they conduct with\r\n\r\ntheir maids in such a way that their children will pick the good\r\n\r\nhabits from them - the language that is used, the way we address\r\n\r\nthem,  the way we deal with them, the way we take them  out  for\r\n\r\nlunch, whether we let them sit outside the cafeteria or they sit\r\n\r\nwith us.  These are the values which the children will pick  up.\r\n\r\nIn  many  cases, the maids are so good that the children  regard\r\n\r\nthem  as  foster  parents.  And these maids have very  important\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   to  the  family,  and  I   would   urge   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans at large not to do anything that will diminish  our\r\n\r\nstanding in the international community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Minister, not because of any pressure\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  but because of our own conviction  that  what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done  is not correct, that the Government has decided  to\r\n\r\nintroduce this legislation.  If nothing else, it will serve as a\r\n\r\nreminder,  I  repeat again, Sir, to those who are not  going  to\r\n\r\nconduct  themselves properly that they are  going  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nmight of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one area which I am a little concerned. Some\r\n\r\nof these maids have the habit  I have one experience through my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessional  dealings   of  making allegations  which  are  not\r\n\r\naccurate.  There may be some truth in the allegation.  I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police were so thorough, that we must pay tribute  to\r\n\r\nour  Home Team, and that the officers concerned investigated the\r\n\r\nmatter.   This  is very important because the Police  have  been\r\n\r\nvery fair.  When the law is being administered, we must see  the\r\n\r\ngenuine from the fake.  There will be some cases, Sir.  But this\r\n\r\nis  an  administrative area.  I would urge the Minister  not  to\r\n\r\ntolerate such acts of these maids which are purely to punish the\r\n\r\nhusband or wife of the household.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an increasing demand for maids. Although it is not\r\n\r\nrelated,  I would like to mention that we may have to live  with\r\n\r\nthis phenomenon for some time to come.  But we should try to see\r\n\r\nthat  we  are less dependent on maids.  This is a social problem\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to consider.  But I am fully in support  of  this\r\n\r\nmove.   This  legislation is necessary.  I hope the  Government,\r\n\r\nthe NMPs and the Opposition in this House will vote and show our\r\n\r\nneighbours and maids that we are all in support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, this is an important issue.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have been shocked by the cases spotlighted  by  the\r\n\r\nmedia  and  I  believe no Singaporean condones the behaviour  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen.   Yet,  there seems to be no  sign  of  the  problem\r\n\r\nabating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the figures of complaints made to the Philippine\r\n\r\nEmbassy alone, we can see that there has been little improvement\r\n\r\nfrom  1992  to 1996.  The number of complaints of ill  treatment\r\n\r\nhad been held fairly constant.  For cases of molest, it had been\r\n\r\nfluctuating from year to year, most notably, although with  some\r\n\r\nfluctuation, complaints about assault had gone up sharply.   The\r\n\r\nMinister's  figures on the Police reports, which  are  different\r\n\r\nfrom  the Embassy's complaints, show similar trends for assault.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  Sir,  in 1992, complaints received by  the  Philippine\r\n\r\nEmbassy  for assault were a mere 20; 1993, 70; 1994,  39;  1995,\r\n\r\n79; 1996, 115.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not have the 1997 figure, Sir.  This kind of stark cruelty,\r\n\r\nSir,  flies  in the face of our ambition of becoming a  gracious\r\n\r\nsociety.  For if we are to become truly a gracious society, then\r\n\r\nwe  must  accord  human  dignity to all of  us,  all  among  us,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  status  or  even\r\n\r\neconomic standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some basics, Sir, that must be respected. And if\r\n\r\nthese basics are not observed, then there must be equal right to\r\n\r\nredress  against  the wrongdoer, no matter who  he  or  she  is.\r\n\r\nDomestic  workers  and foreign maids must have equal  protection\r\n\r\nunder  our laws and equal access to justice and institutions  of\r\n\r\nlaw.   That is the true promise of a gracious society, an  equal\r\n\r\nsociety; that is the promise of human dignity and human  rights.\r\n\r\nIt  only  takes  a few severe cases to bring that  promise  into\r\n\r\nquestion.   It  only  takes a few severe  cases  to  strain  our\r\n\r\nrelationships with the society from which these foreign  workers\r\n\r\ncome  from.   I do not mean just government and government  with\r\n\r\nour neighbouring countries.  I mean between society and society,\r\n\r\npeople to people.  So I join the Government and the Minister  in\r\n\r\nseeking  ways of improving our behaviour and stopping this  ill-treatment of domestic maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, in considering this particular Bill, we should\r\n\r\nhave  two concerns.  The first is whether this amendment is fair\r\n\r\nand  just.   The second is whether this amendment is  sufficient\r\n\r\nfor the task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of fairness and justice, some other MPs and\r\n\r\nNMPs  have spoken on this, and indeed some may question  whether\r\n\r\nthese  particular amendments are fair to Singaporean  employers.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because we are basically proposing a system of unequal\r\n\r\nlaws.   That is, as NMP Claire Chiang has pointed out, you  have\r\n\r\npotentially  a lesser penalty if you strike your  wife  or  your\r\n\r\nchild as opposed to your domestic maid.  That is true too if you\r\n\r\nstrike  a foreign worker who is not a domestic maid or  a  part-time  domestic maid; you also do not get the enhanced penalties.\r\n\r\nThere  are some employers and other people who would argue,  no,\r\n\r\nthis should not be done.  In fact, there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  in  which maids themselves have been guilty of  something\r\n\r\nillegal.  I think these are real concerns.  But I want to  point\r\n\r\nout  why,  to  my  mind,  these unequal  laws  are  nevertheless\r\n\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that there are other cases in which we\r\n\r\ndo  give special attention and special protection to classes  of\r\n\r\npeople.    For  example,  we  guard minors,  the  young  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  our  children,  to a far greater  degree  than  fellow\r\n\r\nadults.   This is not merely because of their age or  youth  per\r\n\r\nse.  Rather, it is a recognition of the particular vulnerability\r\n\r\nof  this class.  So to me, when we talk about this unequality of\r\n\r\nlaws,  the  question must come: do domestic maids fit into  this\r\n\r\ncategory of particular vulnerability?  I believe they do.   They\r\n\r\nare  far  from  home in a strange land with laws,  cultures  and\r\n\r\nsometimes even a language which they do not fully understand  or\r\n\r\nare conversant with.  They live in the homes of their employers,\r\n\r\nsubject to instructions 24 hours a day, sometimes, unreasonable;\r\n\r\nsometimes, reasonable.  And if they face ill-treatment, some  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  friends  to tell and often, do not  feel  comfortable\r\n\r\nenough about our police system to make a complaint.  More to the\r\n\r\npoint,  many  may be reluctant to complain, lest they  may  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  sacked, sent home straightaway for this  will  cause\r\n\r\nthem  great financial loss in addition to the physical and other\r\n\r\nabuses they have already suffered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on this point, I am reminded that our Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower has earlier pointed out our continuing policy  to  give\r\n\r\nforeign workers a two-week period, at the most, once their  work\r\n\r\npermits  are  revoked.  This is a threat, in a way,  that  hangs\r\n\r\nover  the  heads of maids who want to complain.   So  for  these\r\n\r\nreasons, the foreign domestic maids are more vulnerable than the\r\n\r\naverage  person in our society.  And for these reasons, I  stand\r\n\r\napart from those who would say we must raise the other penalties\r\n\r\nfirst.  We should lead with this amendment and if these laws are\r\n\r\nunequal, I think this can be justified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to my second question: whether this\r\n\r\namendment,  on  its own, is sufficient for the problem  that  it\r\n\r\ntries to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolve.  Sir, in making laws and public policy, there are clearly\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways  and  stages for preventing  criminal  or  other\r\n\r\nunwanted  behaviour.  There are at least four we can  think  of:\r\n\r\n(1)  Education and self-control or restraint;  (2)  Counselling,\r\n\r\nmediation,  often by the community;  (3) Preventive intervention\r\n\r\nby  Police or other Government agencies;  (4) Punishment by  the\r\n\r\ncourts.  Of these four possibilities of stages and institutions,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill before this House clearly targets the fourth and  last\r\n\r\npunishment by the courts.  This is not a prescription for  self-control  or  prevention.  These laws, if  passed,  increase  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  possible penalties.  The harm in that case has  already\r\n\r\nbeen done.  The amendment does not help that particular employer\r\n\r\nor  that  particular  maid.  It does not  prevent  a  particular\r\n\r\ninstance of abuse.  At most, we can say we are sending a  signal\r\n\r\nto  other  employers that they should not cause  harm  to  other\r\n\r\nmaids.  Is that signal enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, crimes in a household are not rational and thought\r\n\r\nout in advance.  They are often acted out on impulse, anger or a\r\n\r\nmoment  of  weakness.   In such cases, I  think,  frankly,  this\r\n\r\namendment  will not help.  Acting on impulse or anger,  few  are\r\n\r\ngoing to pause, as NMP Claire Chiang has imagined they might, to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Wait, I will get 1\ufffd times the penalty.  Therefore, I will\r\n\r\nstop.\"   Anger and impulse drive human nature much more strongly\r\n\r\nthan  this.   For  this  reason, while I  agree  that  the  ill-treatment  of domestic maids is an important problem, I  believe\r\n\r\nthis amendment alone is insufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to consider other\r\n\r\napproaches  to  supplement  the present  amendment.   We  should\r\n\r\nrecognise that irrationality is often the cause of these  abuses\r\n\r\nand   address  the  underlying  household  relationship  between\r\n\r\nemployer  and  domestic maid.  And I hope this  Government  will\r\n\r\ntake a multi-pronged approach to the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this approach, penal sanctions, such as those today,\r\n\r\nwill  play  a  part.   They can be a symbol that  we  take  ill-treatment  seriously.   Other measures  are  important.  So  the\r\n\r\nsymbol stands for something real and is not a mere symbol.   The\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  I  have  in  mind relate to the other  stages  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned for prevention, in terms of education, counselling and\r\n\r\nmediation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been learning to use these tools more in\r\n\r\nrecent   years.   We  have  sought  to  apply  them  in  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  family  and concerning the  community.   Beyond\r\n\r\nfamily  members  and  neighbours, let us  also  include  another\r\n\r\nmember  of  many  Singaporean households, the domestic  maid  or\r\n\r\nhelper.   Government  agencies cannot and  should  not  do  this\r\n\r\nalone.   They should work with civil society groups.  There  are\r\n\r\nalready  a  number  of civil society groups  and  non-government\r\n\r\norganisations, such as the Family Life Society, to just  mention\r\n\r\none,  which  already offer some help and counselling to  foreign\r\n\r\nmaids.   More  can be done.  For example, courses for  employers\r\n\r\nand  household members can be held.  But these groups often find\r\n\r\nthemselves  short  of staff and funds to cope  with  the  needs.\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  and  should assist and support  their  work  by\r\n\r\ncloser  coordination  with MCD and relevant  agencies,  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  funding.  Some useful work  that  could  be  done\r\n\r\nincludes  establishing  a hotline, or helpline,  especially  for\r\n\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the employers, I urge information and education. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower has taken steps in this direction.   More\r\n\r\ncan  be  done.  I would urge that on granting and renewing  work\r\n\r\npermits,   the   Ministry  of  Manpower  sends   employers   (a)\r\n\r\ninformation   on   agencies  and  NGOs  to   provide   frontline\r\n\r\ncounselling  and mediation; (b) information about  the  enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties proposed by this Bill, assuming we pass it; and (c)  a\r\n\r\ncode  of  conduct  on treatment of domestic  maids,  if  not,  a\r\n\r\nstandard  contract.   Only some embassies  and  some  employment\r\n\r\nagencies,  as  the  Minister well knows,  have  adopted  such  a\r\n\r\nstandard  contract.  The Government could help in this  case  to\r\n\r\nensure that other agencies are encouraged to follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary aim of what I propose the Ministry or the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  a  whole   do would not be  to  scare  employers\r\n\r\nbecause I think scare tactics would not help us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  impulse  and irrationality take over.  Rather,  it  is  to\r\n\r\nshare  with  them  the  norms  that  this  community  and   this\r\n\r\nGovernment expect of its citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which we could help domestic workers, the\r\n\r\nmaids, is to reconsider our repatriation policy as regards those\r\n\r\nwho  make  complaints.  At this point, I need some clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister or perhaps his colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower.   My limited understanding of the issue  is  that  the\r\n\r\nmaids  who make complaints are treated just as any other foreign\r\n\r\nworker who has his work permit terminated.  In other words, when\r\n\r\nI  complain,  I  lose my job, I go home.  And  as  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  in this short plea, that this in a way is  a  chilling\r\n\r\nfactor.    People  will  not  complain  because  their  economic\r\n\r\nconcerns and their livelihood are tied up with this issue.  They\r\n\r\nwill stomach much too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such measures, Sir, can help prevent ill-treatment. Some\r\n\r\nemployer-maid   relationships  can  be  kept   cordial   through\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  mediation.  In other cases,  if  a  particular\r\n\r\nrelationship is beyond repair, then counselling and this  change\r\n\r\nof manpower policy can help both sides recognise that it is best\r\n\r\nfor  the  maid  to  transfer to a new  employer  to  seek  other\r\n\r\nemployment,   rather  than  to  continue  in   that   household.\r\n\r\nPrevention is a better approach than punishment after the crime.\r\n\r\nThese  measures will also help Singaporeans to be more  educated\r\n\r\nand  move us towards a more gracious society, cognizant  of  the\r\n\r\nhuman dignity of all of us and all among us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, some comments about the drafting of the Bill.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  think  it must be clear to all of us that  while  the\r\n\r\namendments  enhance  the  maximum penalty,  sentences  will  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  heavier.   The  courts  retain  discretion   in\r\n\r\nindividual  cases  to  mete  out punishment  within  the  normal\r\n\r\nlimits, rather than going to the enhanced levels.  This Bill, in\r\n\r\nthis  sense, does not prescribe mandatory penalties.   Many  may\r\n\r\nquestion  this.  I think  this is rightly so, that  these  cases\r\n\r\ninvolve  household relationships, that there are many  variables\r\n\r\nand, therefore, there may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  many mitigating factors involved which should be left to the\r\n\r\ncourts on individual cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill singles out some crimes for enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties but not others, as the Minister has explained.  But  I\r\n\r\nfind  that  this is so even if the other crimes are  of  a  very\r\n\r\nsimilar  nature.  For example, wrongful confinement is  enhanced\r\n\r\nunder sections 343 and 344 of the Penal Code.  However, wrongful\r\n\r\nconfinement  under  section  342  is  not.   To  me,  the   only\r\n\r\ndifference  between these crimes is the period  of  confinement.\r\n\r\nSection  343 is for three days or more.  Section 344 is  for  10\r\n\r\ndays or more.  Section 342, presumably, is for periods less than\r\n\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are differences of quantity and not of quality.\r\n\r\nFor consistency and to send the right signal, I would suggest to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that all these penalties should be enhanced.   It\r\n\r\nshould  then be left to the courts whether to enhance  penalties\r\n\r\nin individual cases as befit the circumstances before them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point on drafting is how this Bill defines\r\n\r\n\"domestic  maids\".  A \"domestic maid\" is defined as \"any  female\r\n\r\nhouse  servant  employed  in, . the  domestic  services  of  her\r\n\r\nemployer's  private  dwelling-house  and  who  resides  in   her\r\n\r\nemployer's private dwelling-house;\".  The last part on residence\r\n\r\nconcerns  me.   It occurs to me that there are circumstances  in\r\n\r\nwhich the employer, the person holding the employment pass,  may\r\n\r\nhouse the maid elsewhere with another person, such as the parent\r\n\r\nor  relative.  This, of course, is against the conditions of the\r\n\r\nwork permit.    However, though it is against the conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe  work  permit, it is not clear if the maid  would  still  be\r\n\r\nprotected  by  this  Bill,  since  she  does  not  live  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer's  house.   This means that the  employer  is  punished\r\n\r\nunder  the  work permit laws, but not the new enhanced penalties\r\n\r\nunder  the  Penal  Code.   For this  reason,  if  there  is  ill\r\n\r\ntreatment, it is not clear if the employer or relative would  be\r\n\r\nsubject to enhanced penalties under the Penal Code.  If this  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  then  people  would benefit by doing  one  wrong,  acting\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the work permit, and avoid punishment for  another\r\n\r\nwrong, enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties under this Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clear these doubts and to give full effect to these\r\n\r\namendments,  I  suggest  the  section  should  have  a   deeming\r\n\r\nprovision.   Such a provision would deem that the holder  of  an\r\n\r\nemployment  permit is, for the purposes of the  Penal  Code,  an\r\n\r\nemployer for the purposes of enhanced penalties, and the maid is\r\n\r\ndeemed to live in the household, no matter what the situation in\r\n\r\nactual  life  is.   This  would then make  two  sets  of  people\r\n\r\npotentially liable, those who are in actual control of the  maid\r\n\r\nand those who hold the work permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill, as I have said from the start,\r\n\r\nbut  I  encourage that this be the first step.  Let  it  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step  and let other measures, by Government  directly  or\r\n\r\nGovernment enabling and civil society following, come after this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In  my\r\n\r\nview,  this is one Bill we should never have needed in the first\r\n\r\nplace.   But I rise to support this Bill, as I believe  that  we\r\n\r\nshould take stern measures against employers who commit offences\r\n\r\nagainst such domestic maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, the legislation appears discriminatory in\r\n\r\nthat  it  treats  offences  against  domestic  maids,  who   are\r\n\r\ngenerally  foreigners,  more  seriously  than  similar  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted by Singaporeans against other Singaporeans.  I have my\r\n\r\nreservations about such discriminatory legislation although,  in\r\n\r\nthis particular case, there is justification for doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assured that the Minister recognises the fear that\r\n\r\nthis legislation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  lead  to abuses when maids may blackmail employers.   There\r\n\r\nhave  been  cases of maids making false allegations about  their\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can all agree that recent cases of abuses of maids\r\n\r\nby  a few employers have tarnished and damaged the reputation of\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially at a time when we want to attract  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  who  work  and  live  here.   This  Bill  reflects  our\r\n\r\nseriousness in ensuring that foreigners are not only welcomed to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  their safety and security safeguarded, but  that  we\r\n\r\nwill go to the extent of having such discriminatory legislation.\r\n\r\nIn  the long run, however, Singapore's reputation as a place and\r\n\r\nhome  for  these  foreigners rests not on such  enforcement  and\r\n\r\ndeterrence, but on the goodwill, trust and respect that we  earn\r\n\r\nof  being  responsible, caring and fair employers.   Until  such\r\n\r\ntime  when  we  can meet in this House again to  remove  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  on  the  ground that such legislation  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrequired, we would not have achieved this goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the Minister to consider other penalties,\r\n\r\nsuch  as to prohibit employers and their immediate families from\r\n\r\never employing a domestic maid, either local or foreign, if they\r\n\r\nare  found guilty of abusing their maids.  In more serious cases\r\n\r\nof  abuse, we should have no hesitation to shame and make public\r\n\r\nthe names of such offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that much of the problems we have seen in recent\r\n\r\ncases stems from the disrespect some Singaporeans have of maids,\r\n\r\nin  particular, and those who work and serve them,  in  general.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  is timely that we considered a campaign  to  inform\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  about  the  real need to  treat  foreigners  well,\r\n\r\nwhether  professionals or casual labourers,  and  especially  to\r\n\r\ninform  them of the important contribution such foreigners  make\r\n\r\nto Singapore's economy and society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I wish to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI rise to speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier sitting of this House on 30th August 1993,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour, in answer to an Oral Question, assured\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  firm action would be taken  against  employers\r\n\r\nfound  abusing their maids.  Not only are they subjected to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  criminal laws of the land, the employer and the  spouse\r\n\r\nwill also be barred from future employment of foreign maids.  It\r\n\r\nnow   appears  that  these  measures  have  been  found  to   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient  in  dealing with the problem.  This  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of grave concern and deep disappointment.  In Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  are  attempting to create a gracious and civil society.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  there  are  those  who  are  obstructing  this\r\n\r\nobjective and who are intent on victimising those who  work  for\r\n\r\nthem and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is proposed in this Bill that the punishment be\r\n\r\nenhanced  to 1.5 times that of the penalties in the  Penal  Code\r\n\r\nfor  the  prescribed offences.  While I agree that the penalties\r\n\r\nshould  be enhanced as proposed, I wonder whether that would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  deal with the mischief that the  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\naddress.   For example, are there enough avenues for  maids  who\r\n\r\nallege  abuse  to  go to report such abuses?   Will  such  maids\r\n\r\nrefrain  from reporting if they think that to do so will  result\r\n\r\nin  them  being unemployed or, worse, being asked to  leave  the\r\n\r\ncountry?   Will  abusive  employers, who  are  cocooned  by  the\r\n\r\nrealisation that the maids may be most reluctant to report them,\r\n\r\nbe sufficiently discouraged by the increase in penalties?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary and desirable to provide a code of\r\n\r\nconduct,  a  series  of obligations of good  conduct,  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer  of every maid should be asked to comply with,  failing\r\n\r\nwhich  they should then be deprived of the services of the  maid\r\n\r\nand  also  be asked to pay the cost of the termination  of  such\r\n\r\nservices.  For instance, they may be asked to pay the  maid  the\r\n\r\nremainder of the contract of services and other costs  to  allow\r\n\r\nsuch  a  maid to gain other employment or to return to her  home\r\n\r\ncountry.  I should emphasise that this is not a proposal to  set\r\n\r\nup  a Maids' Charter or Bill of Rights.  Rather, there should be\r\n\r\na  code of decent behaviour that should serve as a guide to  all\r\n\r\nthose who employ maids.  In this way,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  less  misunderstanding, fewer opportunities  for\r\n\r\nabuse and more harmony between the employer, the family and  the\r\n\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think there should be some controls over maid\r\n\r\nagencies  to  ensure that the maids are properly  briefed  about\r\n\r\ntaking  up  domestic duties in Singapore.  One  often  hears  of\r\n\r\nmaids  who  do  not  understand the standards  of  hygiene,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in Singapore.  Maid agencies should therefore give  the\r\n\r\nmaids orientation courses before they come to Singapore so  that\r\n\r\nthere  will   be less misunderstanding between the employer  and\r\n\r\nthe  employee.   And if there is less dissatisfaction  with  the\r\n\r\nmaid, fewer opportunities for abuse will arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the Bill, there should be additional means\r\n\r\nother than the enhanced punishments to control this problem.   I\r\n\r\nrefer  to  compensation for the victims of abuse.  It  would  be\r\n\r\nextremely difficult, if not impossible, for any abused  maid  to\r\n\r\ngo  through the civil process, for example, to claim for loss of\r\n\r\npay or other costs, such as medical costs.  The courts also have\r\n\r\nthe jurisdiction and powers under the Criminal Procedure Code to\r\n\r\naward to the victims compensation for the abuse.  This would,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  be  a firm signal to the victim that we in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  want  not  only  to  see that the  abusive  employers  be\r\n\r\npunished, but also that the victims be compensated.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nif  this  type  of  compensation is allowed,  the  investigating\r\n\r\nauthorities must be very sure of the circumstances of each case.\r\n\r\nBut as there is already ex hypothesi a criminal investigation in\r\n\r\nprogress, I am sure that the standard approved will be  high  in\r\n\r\nevery case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to draw on a remark made by the\r\n\r\nMinister just now when speaking on the Bill.  He mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill would not cover part-time workers.  On the question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  a  part-time worker should be regarded as somebody  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not deserve this enhanced protection, perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\ncould explain to us why that is the case.  But, in general, Sir,\r\n\r\nI support this Bill subject to the comments I have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking in\r\n\r\nsupport of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill.  I have heard all the comments that they have made and, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  I just want to address a few points raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMembers who have spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok and Mdm Claire Chiang asked whether we\r\n\r\nwould enhance or look at the punishment for family violence.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  issue of family violence was fully debated  when  we\r\n\r\namended the Women's Charter about 1\ufffd years ago, and under  those\r\n\r\namendments  we  have provided a lot of access to women  who  are\r\n\r\nabused  by their husbands and more or less given them an  easier\r\n\r\nway  of getting redress from the courts or the authorities  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  abused by their husbands.  Of course,  I  believe  my\r\n\r\ncolleague in the Ministry of Community Development will continue\r\n\r\nto look at the trends in wife abuse and if the amendments do not\r\n\r\ndeal  with the problem, then in future we may have to relook  at\r\n\r\nthe  punishments again.  But, as of now, I do not think  MCD  is\r\n\r\ngoing to do anything about changing the Women's Charter, because\r\n\r\nI  believe the amendments that it has made have adequately dealt\r\n\r\nwith the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the children who are vulnerable and, therefore, need\r\n\r\nparticular  protection, I believe we have also made revision  to\r\n\r\nthe  Children and Young Persons Act not long ago to enhance  the\r\n\r\npenalties  for people who abuse children.  I think  we  have  to\r\n\r\nwait and see whether the amendments have the intended effect  or\r\n\r\nnot.   If  not,  I believe my colleague will also  do  something\r\n\r\nabout  that.   But,  as  of now, I think  we  should  leave  the\r\n\r\nsituation as it is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have brought up this subject of maids to\r\n\r\nthis  House and ask Parliament to enhance the punishment is that\r\n\r\nmaids are very different from our relatives and other categories\r\n\r\nof  workers.  These maids come from far away countries.  I would\r\n\r\nsay  most  of them are illiterate and live in rural areas.  Some\r\n\r\nhave  practically no idea what Singapore really  is  like  until\r\n\r\nthey step on to our shores and, therefore, adjustment can become\r\n\r\nquite  difficult  for  them.  More so,  when  they  have  to  be\r\n\r\nseparated  from  their families and work in  a  totally  strange\r\n\r\nenvironment under very strange conditions.  I think we  have  to\r\n\r\npay some special\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention  to how they adjust and cope with the new environment.\r\n\r\nIf  in  the process of working here, the employers were to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  them or abuse them, then, in order  to  become  a\r\n\r\ngracious  and  civil  society, we  have  got  to  find  ways  of\r\n\r\nprotecting  them.  Hence, this particular amendment  to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe punishment for those who abuse their maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we should also equate our wives with maids.\r\n\r\nWe  really do not think our wives are maids.  I think all of  us\r\n\r\nlove our wives.  There is no doubt about that.  But for some who\r\n\r\ndo  not, there are other ways for the wives to seek redress from\r\n\r\ntheir  relatives  and from those around them  and  they,  unlike\r\n\r\nmaids  who  are confined to the home, will know how  to  find  a\r\n\r\nplace  to  go  to if they are abused by their husbands.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould  not take this lightly and think that our wives are  like\r\n\r\nmaids and, therefore, we should enhance the punishment for those\r\n\r\nwho  abuse their wives.  But, as I said, if in time, indeed  the\r\n\r\nabuse  of wives is a serious problem, then I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will pay particular attention to that and  amend\r\n\r\nthe law, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also in the process of reviewing the Penal Code for\r\n\r\nother offences and the review has been on-going for a while  and\r\n\r\nI  hope  to be able to move the amendments in Parliament  during\r\n\r\nthis  session.  But until they are ready, I will not be able  to\r\n\r\ntell you more about the sort of amendments that we are going  to\r\n\r\nmake  and  whether or not we are going to enhance the  penalties\r\n\r\nfor family violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang and others have also suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould  have a standardised contract for maids and this  subject\r\n\r\nhas  been  raised many times, particularly with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower.   My colleague,  the Minister for Manpower,  tells  me\r\n\r\nthat  actually the contract between maid and employer is  really\r\n\r\nbetween   the   two   of  them.   Maids  work  under   different\r\n\r\ncircumstances for different reasons, for different employers and\r\n\r\nso  on,  and therefore it is quite difficult to have a  standard\r\n\r\ncontract specifying the exact terms for each of the maids and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers.   But the Manpower Ministry encourages the  employers\r\n\r\nto  have  a  contract with their maids, so that they  know  what\r\n\r\ntheir  obligations are, what their duties are,  what  the  terms\r\n\r\nare,  and  so  on.   And  I  believe that  most  employers  have\r\n\r\ncontracts for their maids.  Otherwise, they will not be able  to\r\n\r\nsettle disputes when these disputes arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Ministry does have a unit in the Ministry to\r\n\r\nhelp  settle disputes for the maids who complain to them or even\r\n\r\nfor  the  employers  who  complain  about  their  maids  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.   My  colleague tells me that the  Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nquite successful in settling most of these disputes.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  see  the need to impose a standard  contract  for\r\n\r\nhiring  of  maids.  Some embassies, for example, do insist  that\r\n\r\nmaids  have  a  standard contract.  For example, the  Philippine\r\n\r\nEmbassy  does  insist that the maids have a  standard  contract;\r\n\r\notherwise they will not be allowed to work in Singapore.  Again,\r\n\r\nwe  leave  it  to  the individual embassies  to  work  out  such\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay suggested that there should be other\r\n\r\napproaches  to  help resolve problems between  maids  and  their\r\n\r\nemployers.  As I said, the Manpower Ministry does have a unit to\r\n\r\nhelp  to mediate in employer-employee disputes between the maids\r\n\r\nand  employers.  But there are other measures that the  Manpower\r\n\r\nMinistry is also considering.  For example, they are considering\r\n\r\nissuing  an advisory to all foreign workers in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nadvisory will give them information concerning the conditions of\r\n\r\nwork  permit  laws  and employment in Singapore,  the  telephone\r\n\r\nnumbers of the helpline of the Ministry, the contact numbers  of\r\n\r\nthe  relevant agencies such as embassies and the Police.  As  Mr\r\n\r\nTay  suggested,  there could be other NGOs  who  could  help  in\r\n\r\nmediation  and  conciliation of problems between  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees.   I  am sure the Manpower Ministry will consider  co-opting them if they can provide assistance to the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is also considering doing an orientation video\r\n\r\non the culture and norms in Singapore and what the foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  can  expect  here,  and  this  will  be  produced   and\r\n\r\ndistributed free to all the employment agencies.  The employment\r\n\r\nagencies  are  also encouraged to screen the  video  to  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers before they even start work.  The advisory and the video\r\n\r\nwill  be  available in a few months' time.  But in the  interim,\r\n\r\nthe  Manpower Ministry has provided the contact numbers  of  the\r\n\r\nForeign  Workers' Unit in the Ministry, through a letter  issued\r\n\r\nto  all  the  employers, to all the domestic foreign workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I believe those of us who are employers of  foreign\r\n\r\nmaids would have received such a notice some time ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from March last year, employers of foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  maids are also required to take up a personal accident\r\n\r\npolicy for their foreign workers as a condition for grant  of  a\r\n\r\nwork  permit, and the minimum sum to be assured is  $10,000  and\r\n\r\nthe  compensation, should it be payable, will be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nforeign domestic worker or her beneficiaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are steps that the Ministry has taken to improve\r\n\r\nthe  working  conditions and the terms of the  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.   And  I  am sure the Manpower Ministry  will  consider\r\n\r\nother  approaches and measures which they may think  about  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  which can help improve the lot of  the  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether his understanding was correct\r\n\r\nregarding  the repatriation policy of foreign domestic  workers,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  if  a worker were to complain, then the worker  would\r\n\r\nlose  the  job  and  be repatriated by the Ministry  or  by  the\r\n\r\nemployer.  Apparently, according to the Manpower Ministry,  this\r\n\r\nis  not  true.   If  a  complaint were to be lodged  against  an\r\n\r\nemployer,  the Manpower Ministry will not allow the employer  to\r\n\r\ncancel  the  work permit just like that, because  they  want  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the  complaint.  And sometimes the domestic  worker\r\n\r\ncould have gone to the embassy and be housed in the embassy, and\r\n\r\nduring  that period the worker also cannot be repatriated.   And\r\n\r\neventually should the maid be found to be not at fault  and  the\r\n\r\nemployer is at fault, and she has paid a lot of money or she\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  wants  to work in Singapore, the Manpower Ministry  will\r\n\r\nallow  her to continue to work in Singapore under a work  permit\r\n\r\nfor a different employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Ministry has been quite flexible, understanding and\r\n\r\ncompassionate  in  considering  the  plight  of  those   foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers who have paid a lot of money to come  here  to\r\n\r\nwork and who really genuinely want to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the drafting suggestions made by Mr Tay, I have been\r\n\r\nguided  by  the Attorney-General that this is the way we  should\r\n\r\ndraft  our laws.  Whether or not we should deem a person who  is\r\n\r\nthe  employer  as a registered employer of the domestic  worker,\r\n\r\neven though that worker may not be working in his household, and\r\n\r\ndeem  the person liable for the enhanced punishment, I think  we\r\n\r\ntake  it  one step at a time.  If there is a trend to show  that\r\n\r\nemployers  overcome the law by getting another person to  employ\r\n\r\nthat worker, and eventually allow the person to work in his home\r\n\r\nand  abuse the maid, then we will amend the law to take care  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem.   So, don't worry employers, if you intend  to  do\r\n\r\nthat, be sure the law will catch up with you in no time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Baharudin suggested banning employers from hiring maids\r\n\r\nif  they  were found to have abused their maids.  Yes, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthat  is  what  the Manpower Ministry does.  If a maid  makes  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint, and the complaint is substantiated, then the employer\r\n\r\nwould  be banned from hiring a domestic worker.  Employers  will\r\n\r\nbe  shamed  indeed if their cases go to court and you  will  see\r\n\r\nthat  their names will be all over the newspapers.  There is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt about that.  Our newspapers will make sure of that too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the code of conduct, as suggested by Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nTet Yung, I understand from my colleague, the Manpower Minister,\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  indeed  being  considered.   They  have  already\r\n\r\nconsidered  putting up a guide for employers so that  they  know\r\n\r\ntheir obligations and how they should treat their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have dealt with most of the questions. If\r\n\r\nthere is any other question which I have left out, please let me\r\n\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TELECOMMUNICATION AUTHORITY OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus of the TAS Act, 1992, was on the separation\r\n\r\nof  the  regulatory  function of TAS  from  the  commercial  and\r\n\r\noperational  functions,  and  on  the  transfer  of  rights  and\r\n\r\nliabilities of the reconstituted TAS to the privatised Singapore\r\n\r\nTelecom  and  Singapore Post.  Since then, the telecommunication\r\n\r\nenvironment  has  greatly  changed.   From  a  single   monopoly\r\n\r\noperator environment, we are now moving towards a multi-operator\r\n\r\nenvironment  where there is aggressive competition  between  all\r\n\r\nplayers.   Today,  we  already  see competition  in  value-added\r\n\r\nnetwork  services,  cellular mobile  telephone  services,  radio\r\n\r\npaging services, and Internet-access services, to name a few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come Year 2000, there will be competition in the biggest\r\n\r\npiece  of the pie, which is the domestic and international basic\r\n\r\ntelecommunication services.  The whole process of liberalisation\r\n\r\naims to sharpen our competitive edge as a global business centre\r\n\r\nand  bring maximum benefits to the consumers.  This can only  be\r\n\r\nrealised  if  there  is in place a strong and  clear  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework which supports a level playing field and ensures fair,\r\n\r\neffective  and sustainable competition among all operators.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the convergence of telecommunications, computing  and\r\n\r\nbroadcasting technologies is a worldwide trend giving rise to  a\r\n\r\nnew info-communications industry.  We will have to encourage the\r\n\r\nintroduction of new and innovative technologies in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nensure our services and infrastructure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet  the  increasingly sophisticated needs  of  businesses  and\r\n\r\nconsumers.   The  regulatory  framework  that  we  develop  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  be able to address these rapid changes  in  both  the\r\n\r\nmarket  environment and technology advancements.   In  order  to\r\n\r\naddress  these  varying issues, the current  TAS  Act  that  was\r\n\r\npassed in April 1992 needs to be amended to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) ensure that TAS has the necessary powers to carry out\r\n\r\nits  functions  and  duties  in  a  liberalised,  multi-operator\r\n\r\nenvironment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) bring the TAS Act up-to-date given changes in\r\n\r\ntechnology and new types of offences; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) ensure that the penalties and enforcement measures\r\n\r\nspecified   in   the   TAS   Act  are   adequate   to   regulate\r\n\r\ntelecommunication and postal licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the key provisions of the Bill. Clause\r\n\r\n3  of  the Bill provides for a new function and duty for TAS  to\r\n\r\ncreate an economic framework for the operation and provision  of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  and  postal systems  and  services.   Such  a\r\n\r\nframework would promote and safeguard competition and  fair  and\r\n\r\nefficient market conduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary if TAS is to regulate any conduct which\r\n\r\nmay restrict competition in telecommunication services or in the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  market.  As part of the regulatory  framework\r\n\r\nthat  TAS  will  establish,  TAS  proposes  to  issue  codes  of\r\n\r\npractice, which would apply to its licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 7 of the Bill provide for additional\r\n\r\nconditions  that  TAS  may impose on a  telecommunication  or  a\r\n\r\npostal  licensee.   In  particular,  conditions  requiring   the\r\n\r\nlicensee  to  enter into agreements or arrangements relating  to\r\n\r\ninterconnection, access and sharing of infrastructure, would  be\r\n\r\nmade express.  The guiding principle is that where licensees are\r\n\r\nunable to agree on the terms and conditions for interconnection,\r\n\r\naccess and sharing of infrastructure, these would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetermined by TAS.  These issues are critical issues in a multi-operator environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interconnection and equitable access between and among\r\n\r\noperators  are essential for end-to-end connectivity and  ensure\r\n\r\ntransparency  to  end  users  in a  multi-operator  environment.\r\n\r\nWhile  TAS  has set broad guidelines for operators to co-operate\r\n\r\nin  this area, TAS would need to be empowered to determine these\r\n\r\nterms and conditions where licensees are unable to agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 7 of the Bill also require telecommunication\r\n\r\nand  postal licensees to comply with TAS' codes of practice  and\r\n\r\nstandards  of performance which TAS is empowered to issue  under\r\n\r\nclause  27  of  the  Bill.  TAS may also  give  directions  with\r\n\r\nrespect   to   standards  of  performance  and  procedures   for\r\n\r\ncompliance by licensees.  Clauses 5 and 8 empower TAS to suspend\r\n\r\nspecific services instead of the entire licence which may  cover\r\n\r\nseveral services, depending on the circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes it a requirement for TAS' prior approval to\r\n\r\nbe  sought  for  connection of equipment to a  telecommunication\r\n\r\nsystem  or  equipment of any licensee, and  not  just  a  public\r\n\r\ntelecommunication licensee.  This is to protect the integrity of\r\n\r\nour networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill provides for further measures against\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  fraud.  Two new offences in  connection  with\r\n\r\ndishonestly   obtaining   a   telecommunication   service    are\r\n\r\nintroduced. With changes in technology, there has been  a  shift\r\n\r\nin offences from the traditional telephony environment to mobile\r\n\r\ncommunications.  Under the first offence, a person is guilty  if\r\n\r\nhe  has in his custody or control, anything which he intends  to\r\n\r\nuse  to  obtain  a  service  dishonestly  or  which  he  intends\r\n\r\ndishonestly, to allow others to use to obtain a service.   Under\r\n\r\nthe  second offence, a person is guilty if he supplies or offers\r\n\r\nto  supply  anything, which is intended to be used to  obtain  a\r\n\r\nservice  dishonestly. These provisions would address  those  who\r\n\r\npossess  cloned  telecommunication equipment  and  use  them  to\r\n\r\ndishonestly  obtain or use a telecommunication service.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant to control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  incidence of fraud, not just to safeguard the industry  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  ensure  that  the higher costs of  operations  do  not\r\n\r\nultimately translate to higher prices to legitimate end-users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of the various cable cut incidents last year\r\n\r\nand  early  this year, we have put in place further measures  to\r\n\r\nensure that parties take due care against such incidents. Clause\r\n\r\n18  increases  the fine that may be imposed for  an  offence  of\r\n\r\ndamaging  a  cable of a telecommunication system to $1  million.\r\n\r\nClause  19  introduces a new section which imposes  a  duty  for\r\n\r\npersons who excavate any land to first ascertain the location of\r\n\r\nany main, cable, pipe, conduit, circuit or wire belonging to  or\r\n\r\nunder the control of a telecommunication system licensee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant new provision is introduced in clause\r\n\r\n23  of  the  Bill.  TAS is empowered to determine the space  and\r\n\r\naccess  requirements by the developer or owner of  the  building\r\n\r\nwho  requires  a telecommunication service to be provided  in  a\r\n\r\nbuilding.   This  is important in a multi-operator  environment.\r\n\r\nTAS,  the  regulator,  is  in the best position  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\noptimally-efficient space requirements of  all  operators  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-operator environment. By doing so,  TAS would ensure  that\r\n\r\nconsumers  are  not deprived of the choice  of   more  than  one\r\n\r\nservice  provider,  for  the provision  of  a  telecommunication\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 expands section 103 to allow all\r\n\r\ntelecommunication   licensees,   and   not   just    a    public\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  licensee,  to  enter  any  building  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of eliminating interruptions or interference to a radio-communication system or service. This is necessary  to  maintain\r\n\r\nthe quality of service to its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 introduces two new sections, sections 103A and\r\n\r\n103B.   Section  103A  empowers TAS  to  give  directions  to  a\r\n\r\ntelecommunication licensee, and to a developer or an owner of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding,   on  the provision of access for the installation  of\r\n\r\nfacilities,  necessary  for  the  provision  or  enhancement  of\r\n\r\nquality  of a telecommunication service.  Section 103B  empowers\r\n\r\nTAS to direct a licensee to co-ordinate and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooperate  with  any other person in the use or sharing  of  any\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  installation, plant  or  system  to  minimise\r\n\r\nduplication or wastage of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining provisions of the Bill are housekeeping\r\n\r\nmatters,  such  as  the  deletion of  obsolete  provisions,  the\r\n\r\nenhancement of penalties under the existing Act as well as  some\r\n\r\nminor amendments, such as removing the restriction on the number\r\n\r\nof   Board  members of TAS.  This is to allow  TAS  to  tap  the\r\n\r\nexpertise of members from various industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides a framework which would equip TAS\r\n\r\nwith  the necessary powers and safeguards for a dynamic,  multi-operator, telecommunications environment.  The implementation of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  amendments  to the  Act  would  serve  to  better\r\n\r\nregulate the industry and protect the interest of  the public as\r\n\r\nwell as improve the standards of performance of the operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the TAS (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, as introduced by the Minister of State for\r\n\r\nCommunications,  are  quite wide ranging, and  these  amendments\r\n\r\nmake  up  to  date the Telecommunication Authority of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAct,  in  a  field  which is characterised by rapid  change  and\r\n\r\nrapidly changing technologies which have very definitive  impact\r\n\r\non  competition, markets and market powers of the players.   The\r\n\r\nTAS  has  a  role  to  create the framework  for  a  competitive\r\n\r\ntelecommunication service system in a market that has the  scale\r\n\r\nand  scope  of  a  natural monopoly.  Further, telecommunication\r\n\r\nservices   have   also  the  features  of   call   and   network\r\n\r\nexternalities which are, in general, spillover gains  to  others\r\n\r\narising from the consumption of that service by an individual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These features of natural monopoly and externalities in the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices industry make the fair and efficient regulation of that\r\n\r\nmarket  environment so difficult.  By the character of a natural\r\n\r\nmonopoly  in  scale  and scope, it is entirely  possible  for  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly  to supply the whole of the market demand cheaper  than\r\n\r\nmultiple firms.  Yet, regulatory controls must be introduced for\r\n\r\na  rule-based  competition,  as  competition  is  good  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumer  and raises the standard of services of the  providers.\r\n\r\nSomeone  asked  me, a few months ago, why the Government  should\r\n\r\nregulate and control our single licence holder, SingTel, to give\r\n\r\nfair  competition to all these new entrants, many of  them  from\r\n\r\noverseas,  when  our own operator may not be so  fairly  treated\r\n\r\noverseas  in  other markets.  I do not know whether  this  is  a\r\n\r\nvalid complaint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good for the consumers here that some regulation for\r\n\r\nuniversal service and interconnection access and the sharing  of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  are provided for in these amendments.   This  is\r\n\r\ndone  in a general environment for encouraging deregulation  and\r\n\r\nallowing  access  for  the  new  prospective  entrants  to   the\r\n\r\nindustry.   Consumers in Singapore have gained from the  limited\r\n\r\ncompetition we have recently seen in the mobile phone and paging\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Prices have fallen substantially and service  quality\r\n\r\nhas  generally  risen.  This augurs well for  further  areas  of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication services which may be deregulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation for competition also gives our own major\r\n\r\nservice  operator the opportunity to get ship-shape and  tip-top\r\n\r\nfor   its   competition  overseas  in  this  very  intense   and\r\n\r\ntechnologically fast driven market.  The most fundamental  tenet\r\n\r\nin this deregulatory exercise must be to enable the industry and\r\n\r\nthe  players  in  it  to be abreast of the latest  technological\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and  the  facility they afford  to  discriminating\r\n\r\nconsumers.  Such technological developments have always expanded\r\n\r\nthe scope for competition and the boundary limits of the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems paradoxical that a deregulatory environment with\r\n\r\nnew  entrants  is also bringing with it new regulations.   These\r\n\r\nregulatory controls which TAS will have to administer  are  more\r\n\r\ncomplex and will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  more  alive  to  the inter-relationships  and  the\r\n\r\nefficient  networking  of  infrastructure  with  interconnection\r\n\r\naccess.  It is an everlasting play for profit, technologies  and\r\n\r\nefficiency for the players, the TAS and the consumers.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will also assure the House that consumers' interest\r\n\r\nwill be safeguarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, clause 26 of the Bill amends two subsections\r\n\r\nof  section  114  dealing  with the  errors  and  omissions  for\r\n\r\ninformation transmitted through telecommunication.  Under  this,\r\n\r\npublic  telecommunication licensee's exclusion of  liability  is\r\n\r\nenabled provided these injuries or losses are beyond the  public\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  licensee's  control.   The  safeguarding   of\r\n\r\nelectronic  snooping or security control are important  features\r\n\r\nfor  public telecommunication licensees.  In the US, people have\r\n\r\nsued  common  carriers for losses due to fraudulent messages  or\r\n\r\nother   economic   losses  due  to  delays  or  distortions   in\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  messages.  One  particular  concern  is  that\r\n\r\nservice  provider employees should not be allowed  to  read  the\r\n\r\ncontents  of  other  people's  messages  without  authorisation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  we  have not built up enough case experience  in  this\r\n\r\nfield  to  pinpoint, as of now, how the lines of  responsibility\r\n\r\nshould  be  identified  or drawn within the  various  ambits  of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  Nonetheless, it is important to know that the\r\n\r\nBill   does   not   exclude  entirely  the   public   licensee's\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank\r\n\r\nthe GPC Chairman for his support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched on the safeguarding of the interest of\r\n\r\nconsumers.   Indeed, safeguarding the interest of  consumers  is\r\n\r\none  of the key objectives of TAS' function as a regulator.   In\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that consumers are able to realise the benefits\r\n\r\nof  effective  and  sustainable competition in a  multi-operator\r\n\r\nenvironment,   a  framework  for  fair  competition   has   been\r\n\r\nestablished.  TAS is mindful that there must be a level  playing\r\n\r\nfield for all operators.  This would be done by establishing the\r\n\r\nrelevant codes of practice and standards of performance for  the\r\n\r\noperators to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomply  under  the  proposed  revisions  to  the  TAS  Act.   As\r\n\r\nmentioned by Mr Chay, consumers have been the main beneficiaries\r\n\r\nsince   competition  was  introduced  in  the  telecommunication\r\n\r\nindustry  last  April.   With  further  liberalisation  of   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  industry, they can look forward  to  enjoying\r\n\r\nthe  wider  range  of new and innovative products  and  services\r\n\r\noffered  at  competitive prices and a high  quality  of  service\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also commented on clause 26 which seeks to amend\r\n\r\nsection 114.  He has rightly pointed out that we have to look at\r\n\r\nthe  implication of this clause and I would like to  assure  the\r\n\r\nMember  that  where  there is loss from  error  or  omission  in\r\n\r\ninformation  transmitted through telecommunication,  the  public\r\n\r\ntelecommunication licensee is not liable where it is due to  the\r\n\r\nfault  of  another person or causes beyond the  control  of  the\r\n\r\npublic telecommunication licensee.  We do this because, in order\r\n\r\nfor  e-commerce, for instance, to thrive, we need to  have  this\r\n\r\nprotection so that the telecommunciation licensee will  be  able\r\n\r\nto  provide   good quality of service standards for transmission\r\n\r\nof  electronic data, and so on.  As for loss due to the fault of\r\n\r\nthe  telecommunication  licensee,  it  is  a  commercial  matter\r\n\r\nbetween the provider of the service and the consumer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay also raised a concern about giving new\r\n\r\nentrants  the  opportunity to compete with SingTel when  SingTel\r\n\r\nitself  is not given the same treatment overseas.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say  that Singapore's competitive edge hinges on our ability\r\n\r\nto  continually respond to technological changes and provide  an\r\n\r\nefficient    and    innovative   info-communication    services.\r\n\r\nLiberalisation of the telecommunication industry  will  help  us\r\n\r\nmaintain our competitive edge and entrench Singapore as a global\r\n\r\nbusiness  centre, besides encouraging SingTel to get  ship-shape\r\n\r\nfor its competition both here and overseas, as pointed out by Mr\r\n\r\nChay.   This  is also in accordance with our commitment  to  WTO\r\n\r\ngroup  of basic telecommunications to help achieve a liberalised\r\n\r\nglobal telecommunication market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.
