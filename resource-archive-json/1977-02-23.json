Within  each  town,  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive network of internal services will bring\r\n\r\nresidents from the various neighbourhoods to the town\r\n\r\ncentre  terminal  where  external  services  to   the\r\n\r\nCentral  Business  District, major industrial  zones,\r\n\r\nand other towns will originate. Where demand is high,\r\n\r\nexpress  services will be introduced. Such  a  system\r\n\r\nwill  make  best  use  of the limited  resources  and\r\n\r\nrestricted road space and reduce operating costs. The\r\n\r\nalternative of linking each part of the town directly\r\n\r\nwith  various  destinations is an  expensive  way  of\r\n\r\nproviding good service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service 220, which was introduced on the 1 5th March\r\n\r\nlast year and is now enjoying good patronage, is  the\r\n\r\nforerunner of internal services for Bedok  New  Town.\r\n\r\nIt  will be strengthened with additional buses as and\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary.

I must answer  his\r\n\r\nquestion   in   the  same  manner.  Funds   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of the swimming pool must come from  the\r\n\r\napproved  yearly Budget allocation to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSports   Council   (SSC),  or  from   donations   and\r\n\r\ncontributions.

I believe that  the\r\n\r\nSSC Master Plan for 1976-1982 provided originally for\r\n\r\nthree  swimming pools in the North Zone, two of which\r\n\r\nare to be sited in the Surin Avenue area.

The music\r\n\r\nand   dance  presentations  included  in  its   Youth\r\n\r\nFestivals have always been recorded and telecast.

Last year, a total of 199 advertisements  were\r\n\r\nrejected   for   showing   on   TV.

For  example,  acceptance   of\r\n\r\ncommercials promoting jeans does not mean  Government\r\n\r\nendorsement or otherwise of that apparel. We are only\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  selling air-time.

Apart  from writing for  TV  and  Radio,\r\n\r\nthere  are  insufficient opportunities and  scope  to\r\n\r\ninduce  more  people  to take  up  scriptwriting  and\r\n\r\nperformance   on   a  full-time  basis.   A   related\r\n\r\nconsideration  is  the need for a greater  number  of\r\n\r\nstaff such as set designers, carpenters, staging crew\r\n\r\nand wardrobe personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Member for Whampoa finds\r\n\r\nthe branch libraries useful, and indeed they are.  We\r\n\r\nwill continue to build these branch libraries in  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  and areas where  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  justifies  the building  of  such  branch\r\n\r\nlibraries. There are already two branch libraries  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and  Toa Payoh. The next  branch  library\r\n\r\nwill  be  opened  in Katong in 1978.

The Ministry has been keeping under\r\n\r\nconstant study and review developments in the use  of\r\n\r\nalternative energy sources besides fuel oil. Research\r\n\r\ninto these areas is being encouraged. Studies on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  solar  energy have been  undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nMechanical   and   Engineering  Department   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore and research  is  still  in\r\n\r\nprogress.  There  has  been  some  progress  in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of methods for the conversion  of  solar\r\n\r\nenergy  into  electrical energy by solar  engines  in\r\n\r\ncountries  like Israel, Italy and the  USA.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  technical feasibility of such methods to produce\r\n\r\nelectrical   energy  on  a  small  scale   has   been\r\n\r\ndemonstrated, such methods have not yet  reached  the\r\n\r\nstage  of  being  economically viable.  Further,  the\r\n\r\namount  of  electricity generated  by  known  methods\r\n\r\nwould  not be sufficient to meet the needs of  blocks\r\n\r\nof   HDB   flats.   Unless  there  is   a   technical\r\n\r\nbreakthrough resulting in drastic cost reduction,  it\r\n\r\nis  unlikely  that  any  scheme  for  the  supply  of\r\n\r\nelectricity through the use of solar energy would  be\r\n\r\navailable  in  the  near future.  The  Ministry  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to monitor developments in this  field  and\r\n\r\nencourage  research in the conversion and utilisation\r\n\r\nof solar energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, may I just seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nhon.

I shall try to answer those  policies\r\n\r\nand actions which appear to be misunderstood. I shall\r\n\r\nalso  outline  the  decision-making and  consultative\r\n\r\nprocesses  in the Ministry of Education to show  that\r\n\r\ndespite contrary views expressed by some Members  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  does  not  rush into  changes  and  ad  hoc\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Moral and Social Values and Attitudes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been asked as to what is meant by\r\n\r\n\"Asian values\". This term is only a convenient way of\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  variety of norms,  practices  and\r\n\r\nbeliefs  inherent  in  the cultures,  traditions  and\r\n\r\ncustoms  of  Asia.  It  is  intended  only  in   this\r\n\r\ngeographical  sense. Since the vast majority  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  are of Chinese, Malay and  Indian  ethnic\r\n\r\norigin  and we are in a geographically Asian context,\r\n\r\nit  is  essential to our survival as  a  nation  that\r\n\r\nvalues and attitudes based on the Chinese. Malay  and\r\n\r\nIndian  cultures, traditions and customs are promoted\r\n\r\nand  encouraged But this does not mean  that  Western\r\n\r\nvalues and attitudes have no place in our society and\r\n\r\nschool   curriculum.  It  is  only  the  values   and\r\n\r\nattitudes  of  the  West that are pernicious  to  our\r\n\r\nsociety that we are against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the teaching of these desirable values and\r\n\r\nattitudes in our schools, while this is done  through\r\n\r\nthe  subject  Education  for Living  at  the  primary\r\n\r\nlevel,  at  the  secondary level, there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nsingle subject but three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseparate  subjects of Civics, Geography and  History.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  teaching and acquisition of  desirable\r\n\r\nvalues and attitudes is not by formal lessons in  the\r\n\r\nclassroom alone but also by precept and example.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  teachers  but parents, family and  friends  all\r\n\r\nhave a part to play in this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Language Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticism has been directed at the announcement made\r\n\r\nby   the   Ministry  of  Education  on  22nd  January\r\n\r\nregarding first and second language requirements  for\r\n\r\nadmission   to  Junior  Colleges  and  Pre-University\r\n\r\nclasses  from 1979. This is no new and ad hoc  policy\r\n\r\nbut  a  continuation and development of the bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy  advocated  17  years  ago  in  1959.  It   is\r\n\r\nimportant for those graduating from universities  who\r\n\r\nwill  be holding key positions of leadership  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  to be effectively bilingual in their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue   and   English.  The  language   requirements\r\n\r\nannounced  on  22nd January are principally  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of raising the level of the first language of\r\n\r\nthose  entering the universities. Employers  in  both\r\n\r\nthe public and private sectors have complained of the\r\n\r\ndeclining  standards in language  of  our  university\r\n\r\ngraduates. The universities, on the other hand, blame\r\n\r\nthis  on the standard of the students coming to  them\r\n\r\nfrom the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to raise the level of the first language is\r\n\r\nshown  by  the results in English as a first language\r\n\r\nin  the  GCE `O' level examinations. In 1973, 35%  of\r\n\r\nthose  who sat for the examination passed in  English\r\n\r\nas  the first language. 37% in 1974 and 44% in  1975.\r\n\r\nWhile  the intention of the announcement is to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  level  of the first language, we have to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  this  is not done at the expense of the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage. Therefore, minimum standards have also been\r\n\r\nspecified  for the second language for  admission  to\r\n\r\nJunior Colleges and Pre-University classes from 1979.\r\n\r\nBut  these  minimum standards are not  high  Grade  8\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  specified for 1979 is  really  just\r\n\r\nbelow pass level, while Grade 7 which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  specified for 1980 and 1981 is  still  not\r\n\r\neven  a pass at `O' level, that is, equivalent  to  a\r\n\r\npass at Sec. II or Ill level. These grades should  be\r\n\r\nattainable  by most pupils as is shown  by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the proportion of pupils who sat for and passed\r\n\r\nthe  GCE  `O' levels in Chinese as a second language,\r\n\r\nfor  example, was 60% in 1973, 57% in 1974,  59%  in\r\n\r\n1975 and 69% in 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the language requirements are not\r\n\r\nintended as a bar to those who are well qualified for\r\n\r\nand able to benefit fully from a university training.\r\n\r\nConsideration  may  be  given  to  exceptional  cases\r\n\r\ndepending  on the merits of each. A general exception\r\n\r\nto  those who score not more than an aggregate of  15\r\n\r\npoints  has  already  been announced.  They  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed provisional admission to Junior Colleges  and\r\n\r\nPre-University classes even if they fail to meet  the\r\n\r\nlanguage requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Kindergartens</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request was made that the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\ntakes  over  all  kindergartens in order  to  control\r\n\r\nstandard and quality. I wish to inform the House that\r\n\r\nthere is provision for kindergartens to be registered\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry  and satisfy certain  conditions.\r\n\r\nStandard  and  quality of teaching are  some  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions. I would also like to inform hon.  Members\r\n\r\nthat   a   committee  has  been  set  up   comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the Ministry of  Social  Affairs,\r\n\r\nthe People's Association and officials of my Ministry\r\n\r\nto  look  into the improvements that can be  made  in\r\n\r\nkindergarten education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Village Schools</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that most rural aided schools are small\r\n\r\nbut  not  all  of  them are sub-standard.  It  is  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's   policy  to  encourage   the   Management\r\n\r\nCommittees  of  these aided schools to rebuild  where\r\n\r\nthere is a need. My Ministry is offering them capital\r\n\r\naid   up   to  50%  of  the  total  approved  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure. A number of village schools have already\r\n\r\nbeen rebuilt or extended through this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adult Education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education programme is managed mainly by the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Board. It runs language  courses  in\r\n\r\nour  four  official languages as  well  as  in  other\r\n\r\nlanguages  such  as  Japanese,  German,  French   and\r\n\r\nArabic.  In 1976, a total of 10,000 students attended\r\n\r\nthese courses. In the field of general education, the\r\n\r\nBoard conducts courses leading to the GCE `O' and `A'\r\n\r\nlevels.  There were over 20,000 students enrolled  in\r\n\r\nthese  courses  in  1976.  Students  in  the  Board's\r\n\r\ncommercial   education  courses  are   prepared   for\r\n\r\nexternal  examinations and examinations conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board.  A total of over 9,800 students  attended\r\n\r\nthese  courses in 1976, of whom 2,000 were  full-time\r\n\r\nday  students. The Board also conducted a variety  of\r\n\r\nvocational  and  technical education  courses  for  a\r\n\r\ntotal of over 7,200 students in 1976. There were also\r\n\r\nfurther  education  courses in  Interior  Decoration,\r\n\r\nHome  Furnishing and so forth for which the enrolment\r\n\r\nin 1976 was over 4,700.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is expected to continue with these types\r\n\r\nof  programmes. In particular, more emphasis will  be\r\n\r\ngiven to commercial education. The Board will also be\r\n\r\norganising  and  conducting the  extension  education\r\n\r\nprogramme for the primary school Basic Course  pupils\r\n\r\nwho enter the Junior Trainee Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Evaluation and Assessment of the Education System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments were made on the Basic Course and its\r\n\r\nintroduction  projected  as  an  indictment  of  past\r\n\r\npolicies  and  actions of the Ministry of  Education.\r\n\r\nThis  was  put forward as reasons for commissions  of\r\n\r\ninquiry  to be set up and for reviews to be  made  of\r\n\r\npast policies and actions. I do not think there is  a\r\n\r\nneed for such a Commission. The Basic Course has been\r\n\r\nintroduced as a continuation and development  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  launched  some 17 years  ago  to  provide\r\n\r\nuniversal  primary education. The initial efforts  in\r\n\r\nthis  programme  were  towards  providing  places  in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools for all those eligible for admission\r\n\r\n..  Not only has this been achieved but the success\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation  control programme has been so  successful\r\n\r\nthat there has been a reduction in the primary school\r\n\r\nenrolment  of  about  13% from  363,000  in  1966  to\r\n\r\n316,000  10  years  later in 1976.  The  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ntherefore now in a position to allow retention to  be\r\n\r\npractised at all levels in the primary school  system\r\n\r\nand  also provide an avenue for channelling into  the\r\n\r\nBasic Course those pupils who are unable to cope with\r\n\r\nthe more academically-inclined Standard Course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was as a result of a continuous review and\r\n\r\nmonitoring of the education system. There is  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Education,  a  Ministerial   Committee\r\n\r\nchaired  by the Minister and comprising the  Minister\r\n\r\nof    State,   Parliamentary   Secretary,   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Director of Education, heads of  branches\r\n\r\nand  other  senior  officials of the  Ministry.  This\r\n\r\ncommittee   meets  monthly  and  reviews  the   major\r\n\r\npolicies and activities of the Ministry. In addition.\r\n\r\nthere  is a Planning and Review Committee chaired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretary and comprising the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Education  and  other  senior  officials  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  which directs research into and  collection\r\n\r\nof  data  on various aspects of the education system.\r\n\r\nmakes  recommendations  and reviews  plans  and  work\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  The Planning and Review Branch, set  up\r\n\r\nsome  six  months ago, researches into  and  collects\r\n\r\ndata  on the education system and monitors it closely\r\n\r\nthrough  sources  both within the  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nschools and from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, special committees may be set up\r\n\r\nwith  the  best  expertise available  from  different\r\n\r\nsources  to review particular aspects of the  system.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the recent review of the  secondary\r\n\r\nschool technical education programme, a committee was\r\n\r\nset  up chaired by a professional engineer in private\r\n\r\nindustry who also has been and is a member of various\r\n\r\npublic   bodies.  The  committee  members   comprised\r\n\r\nanother  industrialist  in  the  private  sector  and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  University  of   Singapore,\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and the Ministry of Education.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of this committee, changes  were\r\n\r\nmade to the secondary school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical education curriculum in Secondary 1 classes\r\n\r\nthis  year.

Since early last year, a team  of\r\n\r\nsenior  Ministry officials have been visiting schools\r\n\r\nto   find   out  their  problems  and  have  informal\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with the principals and senior  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff.   In  addition,  a  series  of  seminars   and\r\n\r\nworkshops for principals and teachers have  been  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  held  where  policies,  plans   and\r\n\r\nproblems   are  discussed  and  recommendations   put\r\n\r\nforward. These recommendations are, in turn,  studied\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  officials. The Ministry  officials\r\n\r\nthemselves also have regular residential seminars  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  basic  issues of concern  to  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is consultation with bodies outside the\r\n\r\nMinistry and the schools too. For instance, the  NTUC\r\n\r\nand   the   teachers'  unions  as  well  as  employer\r\n\r\norganisations  have  been consulted  from  the  early\r\n\r\nstages in the formulation of the Basic Course and the\r\n\r\nJunior Trainee Scheme and continue to be consulted on\r\n\r\nthis. The teachers' unions were also consulted before\r\n\r\nthe  changes  to  the  Secondary  1  curriculum  were\r\n\r\naffected this year. Members who are concerned  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether civil servants read Hansard and whether their\r\n\r\ncomments  are  taken seriously may be  interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Planning and Review  Branch  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education has compiled a  list  of  the\r\n\r\ncomments  made by Members pertaining to the education\r\n\r\nsystem  since 1972.

Is there not  a  co\r\n\r\nordinating body to over-view all the decisions before\r\n\r\nany  of these committees are allowed to go ahead with\r\n\r\nwhatever terms of reference they have been entrusted?\r\n\r\nIs this not the cause of all the problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is\r\n\r\nno. There is no such danger. These committees set  up\r\n\r\nas  and  when necessary are working committees.  They\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations  to  the  Planning  and  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.  These  recommendations,  in   turn,   are\r\n\r\nstudied  and  if  found acceptable, are  put  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial Committee for a final decision. There are\r\n\r\ntherefore two layers of coordinating committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one subject raised in the Defence\r\n\r\nPolicy statement excited more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention,  both  inside this House and  outside  it,\r\n\r\nthan  other matters. This is the proposal  to  enlist\r\n\r\nwomen  into full-time national service. Most MPs  who\r\n\r\nspoke  on  the subject supported the idea,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon Gardens and the Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta argued quite logically that\r\n\r\nsince  men and women are equal, this equality  should\r\n\r\nextend  to  their obligation to defend  the  country.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  time comes to enlist them, women  will  be\r\n\r\ntrained and posted to non-combatant duties, as is the\r\n\r\npractice in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs, however, queried the need to enlist\r\n\r\nwomen  into the army. Their reservations are  however\r\n\r\nbased  on  a  misunderstanding, which I now  wish  to\r\n\r\nclear up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan argues that it is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary  now  to extend  national  service  to\r\n\r\nwomen. I agree with him. There are now enough 18-year\r\n\r\nold men to replace those going ROD. But, as explained\r\n\r\nin  the  Addendum  to  the President's  Address,  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  available in future years will  get  smaller\r\n\r\nand  smaller and that in ten years' time, the  number\r\n\r\nwill be about 30% less than what it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum states that this has consequences which\r\n\r\nare  being examined in MINDEF, Obviously, there is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  review manpower establishment in the  army,\r\n\r\nbut  however much we trim down the establishment, it\r\n\r\nis  unlikely that this could achieve a 30% saving  in\r\n\r\nmanpower.  Therefore, if we want  to  maintain  force\r\n\r\nlevels  at present strength, it will be necessary  to\r\n\r\nrecruit women to fill up non-combatant posts, as  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done  in  other armies. This is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nsimple  arithmetic  and I do not  think  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to have a public forum, as the Member  has\r\n\r\nsuggested, to prove that two plus two equals four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to extend NSF to women has excited a\r\n\r\nlot  of comment because it seems novel. There are two\r\n\r\npoints  of clarification I want to make on this.  The\r\n\r\nfirst is that women soldiers are not really a novelty\r\n\r\nin Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  Members are well aware. But few people know  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  less than 2,544 women soldiers  in  the\r\n\r\nregular service. In fact, we have more women soldiers\r\n\r\ntoday  in the regular service than there are soldiers\r\n\r\nin the two battalions during the colonial times These\r\n\r\nwomen  are  in  vocations such  as  typists, clerks.\r\n\r\ntelephonists, electronic  technicians, drivers  and\r\n\r\nstorekeepers.   My   second   observation   is   that\r\n\r\nenlistment  of NSF women is not something which  will\r\n\r\ntake  place  immediately. The  manpower  shortage  is\r\n\r\nprospective rather than immediate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has made a plea on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  women and expressed the hope  that  since\r\n\r\nthey  are  a  special asset to the  nation, and  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  asset  is their feminity, national  service\r\n\r\nfor  women  should  be such as not  to  destroy  this\r\n\r\nfeminity. I give the Member full assurance  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces will not perpetrate  such  a\r\n\r\nheinous deed as destroying the feminity of our women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah makes the point that\r\n\r\nthose who are not selected one year after the call-up\r\n\r\nage of 18 should be granted deferment. This, in fact,\r\n\r\nis  the  general practice at present. There could  be\r\n\r\nspecial  circumstances;  for  example,  a  registrant\r\n\r\nneeded  time to recover from illness or he  is  doing\r\n\r\nsecondary or tertiary education at the age of 18.  In\r\n\r\nsuch instances they will be called even after the age\r\n\r\nof  19. Should any of them encounter difficulty  over\r\n\r\nemployment,  they  could get a certificate  from  the\r\n\r\nCentral Manpower Base to the effect that they are not\r\n\r\nliable for full-time national service. Older MPs  are\r\n\r\naware of this procedure,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem which affects Malay MPs more than\r\n\r\nthe  others because of the specific circumstances  of\r\n\r\npast recruitment policy in the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, recruitment into the SAF had to take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the ethnic distribution  of  soldiers,\r\n\r\nboth  national servicemen and regulars.  This  is  an\r\n\r\naccepted  practice in multi-racial societies  because\r\n\r\nmilitary  service is a matter of importance  and  the\r\n\r\nethnic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistribution  of soldiers is obviously an  important,\r\n\r\nyet  delicate, subject. When national service  began,\r\n\r\nthere was a large preponderance of Malay soldiers  in\r\n\r\nthe  army  because the regulars of the two battalions\r\n\r\nwe  inherited  from  the British were  preponderantly\r\n\r\nMalays. The non-Malays, especially the Chinese,  were\r\n\r\nsimply not interested then in joining the army.  This\r\n\r\nwas especially true of the regular NCO ranks. Because\r\n\r\nof  this, the intake of Malays into national  service\r\n\r\nwas  limited for some years. This did not present any\r\n\r\nproblem  to the army because total numbers  available\r\n\r\nwere  in  any event much more than could be  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, over the years, we had increasing numbers of\r\n\r\nnon-Malays entering the regular service as  NCOs  and\r\n\r\nthe  ethnic  balance  of  this  important  group   of\r\n\r\nmilitary  personnel  has  moved  nearer  towards  the\r\n\r\nproportion  in the general population.  So,  as  from\r\n\r\nthis  year,  increasing numbers of Malay  youths  are\r\n\r\nbeing enlisted into the army and this will be evident\r\n\r\nat  the decentralised National Day parades this year.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  which the Member for Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nraised is, therefore, a passing one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has made a number\r\n\r\nof  observations on defence policy, and I would  like\r\n\r\nto  comment on them in detail. The hon. Member  seems\r\n\r\nto be in favour of total involvement of all citizens,\r\n\r\nmen  and women, in the defence of our Republic. While\r\n\r\nI respect the sentiment which inspires such a view, I\r\n\r\nam  doubtful  as  to its wisdom.  One  of  the  prime\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  building up a  defence  force  is  to\r\n\r\ncreate a climate of confidence which would enable the\r\n\r\nordinary   business  of  life  to   go   on   without\r\n\r\nimpediment.  If  we  were  to  adopt  the  policy  he\r\n\r\nrecommends,  that is total involvement of  every  man\r\n\r\nand  woman in defence of the country, this  may  well\r\n\r\ncreate   anxiety,   and  even  introduce   a   crisis\r\n\r\natmosphere where none exists now. I think this  is  a\r\n\r\nwrong thing to do when there is no military threat to\r\n\r\nour security discernible on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards deferment on medical or financial\r\n\r\ngrounds,  the  principle has been  well  established.\r\n\r\nApplications for exemption on financial  grounds  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  by  an advisory board which  consists  of\r\n\r\nprominent citizens from industry, the civil  service,\r\n\r\nthe  universities and the professions. Exemptions are\r\n\r\ngranted  only in serious cases in which  hardship  is\r\n\r\nmore  than  temporary. Exemptions on medical  grounds\r\n\r\nare  granted  only if the person is  certified  by  a\r\n\r\nmedical  board  (consisting of three doctors)  to  be\r\n\r\npermanently  unfit  for  national  service.  However,\r\n\r\nthose  with HSC/4 qualifications are still called  up\r\n\r\nfor  full-time  national service  even  if  they  are\r\n\r\nmedically unfit and are posted to sedentary  civilian\r\n\r\noccupations instead of undergoing military  training.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to ensure that the medically unfit  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  an  advantage  over  the  fit  in  respect   of\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  Many are  posted  to  outside\r\n\r\nMinistries,  for  instance,  in  the  Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment  where  they are good at calculating  what\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  have to pay. They work, of  course,  under\r\n\r\nsupervision of experienced staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Serangoon Gardens has raised\r\n\r\nthe  question on the future role of volunteers in the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Defence  Force (PDF). He  asked  whether  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  force  could not be  detailed  to  certain\r\n\r\nsecurity  duty so as to release the regular army  and\r\n\r\nreservists for other roles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PDF has a long and interesting history and close\r\n\r\nconnections  with  Members  of  Parliament  during  a\r\n\r\nperiod.  In  fact,  at one time,  all  MPs  who  were\r\n\r\nphysically  fit were members of the PDF, and  a  good\r\n\r\nmany  were commissioned as officers. Sad to  say,  of\r\n\r\nthese, only two remain, namely, the Member for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  and the Member for Kampong Chai Chee.  These\r\n\r\ntwo are now officers in the 101st Battalion, PDF, and\r\n\r\nhave  reached  the rank of Captain.  Since  the  last\r\n\r\nelections,  the  number of MPs in the  battalion  has\r\n\r\nincreased by 50% from two to three, with the election\r\n\r\nof the Member for Serangoon Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few words about the history of\r\n\r\nthis battalion, 101 PDF, as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsoldiers  call it, how it came about,  and  what  its\r\n\r\nfuture  is  likely to be. The 101 PDF can  trace  its\r\n\r\nancestry  to  the  former Singapore  Volunteer  Corps\r\n\r\nwhich  was  started by the British in the year  1854.\r\n\r\nDuring  confrontation, some volunteers were mobilised\r\n\r\nfor full-time service and the unit was re-titled 10th\r\n\r\nBattalion, Territorial Army. Members would  recollect\r\n\r\nthat we were then part of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After August 1965, the battalion was re-titled 10th\r\n\r\nPDF  and the number has now been changed to 101  PDF.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  distinguish it  from  the  PDF  reserve\r\n\r\nbattalions   consisting  of  certain  categories   of\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  after  their  ROD,  and   these\r\n\r\nbattalions start with lower serial numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101 PDF is really a composite unit of volunteer\r\n\r\nelements   consisting   of  the   original   infantry\r\n\r\nbattalion, the volunteer engineers, formerly 106 PDF.\r\n\r\nthe  S Battery of the Volunteer Artillery and the PDF\r\n\r\nWomen. This amalgamation took place in May 1974. This\r\n\r\nwas  necessary because each of these different groups\r\n\r\nhad  been  dwindling  in numbers through  the  years,\r\n\r\nmainly because no significant role could be found for\r\n\r\nthe volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After amalgamation in 1974, it was still not certain\r\n\r\nwhether  the battalion would survive or would  die  a\r\n\r\nnatural death through continuing attrition of members\r\n\r\nleaving  the  battalion. Many in MINDEF thought  that\r\n\r\nthe battalion would die, but in fact it refused to do\r\n\r\nso.  No  one understood what the reason for this  was\r\n\r\nalthough  there was some speculation. One  school  of\r\n\r\nthought,  for  instance, believed that the  continued\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the battalion was due to the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe   officers'   mess   had   the   most   sumptuous\r\n\r\nairconditioned bar in the SAF. I do not believe  this\r\n\r\ntheory because I think, by and large, ours is  not  a\r\n\r\nboozing army. Another theory was that the annual  in-camp  training  was  well  attended  because  members\r\n\r\nwanted  to escape from their wives. This may  or  may\r\n\r\nnot be true. I have no evidence one way or the other.\r\n\r\nSo  to  find  out what the facts were, when  101  PDF\r\n\r\ncarried out its annual in-camp training from 17th May\r\n\r\nto 29th May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1976,  at  Pulau  Tekong Camp I, I  decided  to  send\r\n\r\nMINDEF's research team to this Camp to find out  what\r\n\r\nwas happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reported an interesting situation. Morale\r\n\r\nappeared  to  be  very  high. One  soldier  told  the\r\n\r\nresearch staff:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can quit any time we want and our presence here\r\n\r\ntoday  is  art  indication of our  interest  and  our\r\n\r\nhappiness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The report goes on to note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A look at the barrack lines reveals the presence\r\n\r\n`of   clothes   of  all  colours  and  hues   blowing\r\n\r\ntriumphantly  on  the  clothes  lines  (outside   the\r\n\r\nbarracks( in the afternoon sea breeze coming from the\r\n\r\nSouth China Sea Inside and outside the barracks,  men\r\n\r\nappeared  in  various  types of  clothes, regulation\r\n\r\ntraining  uniforms, regulation PT  kits,  unregulated\r\n\r\nshorts  and  T-shirts of all sizes and colours,  some\r\n\r\neven  bearing the slogan \"Cancel last order\", whilst\r\n\r\nsome  soldiers were jogging around in beautiful track\r\n\r\nsuits. An air of freedom and satisfaction appeared to\r\n\r\nbe the prevailing mood:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military performance was not too bad and the\r\n\r\ntrainfire  result  not  entirely  discreditable,  67%\r\n\r\npassing  the test. Discipline seemed to be excellent,\r\n\r\nthere  being  only one disciplinary case,  a  private\r\n\r\nsoldier   being  reprimanded  for  arguing   with   a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  officer. There seemed to be a  camaraderie\r\n\r\namong  members of the battalion which  is  not  often\r\n\r\nfound in other army units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report stated that most officers and men agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the  quality of food had improved considerably.\r\n\r\nHowever, they felt that the quantity of food  served\r\n\r\nwas insufficient to satisfy the improved appetite  of\r\n\r\nmen  under  rigorous physical training. However,  the\r\n\r\nprivate  soldiers complained about  having  to  serve\r\n\r\nfood to officers during meal time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research team listed out some of the grievances\r\n\r\nof  members of the battalion. In general,  they  felt\r\n\r\nthat  they were being neglected, which was of  course\r\n\r\nquite true. They felt that promotion prospects in the\r\n\r\nbattalion   were  virtually  absent.   One   corporal\r\n\r\ncomplained  that he served between 1947 and  1956  in\r\n\r\nthe  volunteer  corps  and had reached  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nsergeant. When he rejoined in 1969, his old rank  was\r\n\r\nnot  given him, There was a widespread complaint that\r\n\r\nemployers were not sympathetic in granting them leave\r\n\r\nto attend in-camp training. All the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolunteers wanted to know what the future was. As one\r\n\r\nsoldier puts it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Because of the peculiar type of treatment we\r\n\r\nvolunteers get, some people think we must be  Out  of\r\n\r\nour  minds  to volunteer, but nevertheless  we  still\r\n\r\nvolunteer.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One soldier identified in the MINDEF report as No.\r\n\r\n2175148/J, Pte Lau Teik Soon, asked the research team\r\n\r\nto   get   answers  to  two  questions  from   higher\r\n\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n(a) For what priorities do volunteers exist as far as\r\n\r\nMINDEF  is concerned? (b) What are the prospects  for\r\n\r\nvolunteers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions posed by Pte. Lau Teik Soon have been\r\n\r\nexercising the minds of MINDEF General Staff and  PDF\r\n\r\nHQ.  Since Pte. Lau has transformed himself into  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon  Gardens,  it  has  also  been\r\n\r\nexercising  my mind. I therefore want to examine  the\r\n\r\nproblems in detail and to suggest some solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of the problem is that the hardcore, i.e.,\r\n\r\nthose who refuse to die, is not sufficient in numbers\r\n\r\nto  form  a  full-strength  infantry  battalion.  The\r\n\r\nhardcore consists of 41 officers and 133 other ranks,\r\n\r\nas  against  some  800, all told, needed  to  form  a\r\n\r\nbattalion.  Before  any solution is  possible,  there\r\n\r\nmust   be   some  credible  means  of  getting   more\r\n\r\nvolunteers. Previous recruitment exercises  met  with\r\n\r\ndisappointing results. In 1972, against a  target  of\r\n\r\n300,  there were only 35 suitable applicants of which\r\n\r\nonly  19 were subsequently enlisted. The exercise  in\r\n\r\n1974 fared no better. Until some means could be found\r\n\r\nto get better results, 101 PDF will, I fear, continue\r\n\r\nto  limp along. This is where hon. Members can  help,\r\n\r\nespecially  the younger MPs and the new ones.  Unless\r\n\r\nthey  show an example by coming forward to  join  101\r\n\r\nPDF,  they  can hardly expect the general  public  to\r\n\r\nrespond  with  enthusiasm. If  there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers of MPs volunteering to join the battalion,  I\r\n\r\nwill  arrange  for  a suitable officer  cadet  course\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be undertaken after working  hours  and\r\n\r\nduring weekends for these MPs as well as for existing\r\n\r\nmembers of the battalion who are of officer material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, the MPs concerned could help in the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  drive.  Nearly all  constituencies  have\r\n\r\nyouth groups, some of whose members could be suitable\r\n\r\nmaterial  for  this battalion. If Members  find  this\r\n\r\nidea  attractive, I suggest that they  could  form  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  under the leadership of the three  Members\r\n\r\nof the House who are members of 101 PDF, and work out\r\n\r\nplans on how to progress the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDF HQ is thinking of raising, in three phases, four\r\n\r\nRifle  Companies of the battalion, a support company,\r\n\r\nas  well as an HQ Company. We have sufficient regular\r\n\r\nofficers  and  NCOs  to assist  in  the  buildup  and\r\n\r\ntraining   of  the  battalion;  training  areas   and\r\n\r\ntraining courses could be made available. The problem\r\n\r\nis  to get enough men who are as keen, dependable and\r\n\r\ndurable as the hardcore which refused to give up. And\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the young, fit and new MPs will respond\r\n\r\nto this challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives me\r\n\r\ngreat  pleasure  to welcome 11 new  Members  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It has been my duty to have followed  closely\r\n\r\nwhat  they have said in the proceedings of  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  days. I may not always have been here physically\r\n\r\nbut  with the aid of modern electronics, I can assure\r\n\r\nMembers that I do with considerable ease follow  what\r\n\r\ntakes  place, not only when they speak but when  they\r\n\r\nlaugh,  not  very  often, when they jeer, even  less\r\n\r\noften,  when they interject, rarely at all. It  is  a\r\n\r\nlivelier session than it has been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I ought to begin by saying that they ought\r\n\r\nto take themselves seriously because we, on this side\r\n\r\nas  Members  of the Government, take them  seriously.\r\n\r\nUpon   us  is  the  burden  of  finding  a  successor\r\n\r\nGovernment worthy of its responsibilities. It is  not\r\n\r\nan  easy job. First, let me explain the shock for new\r\n\r\nMembers.  They have been at the hustings.  They  made\r\n\r\ndifferent kinds of speeches. They come here, they are\r\n\r\nbound by Standing Orders and rules of debate which we\r\n\r\nhave inherited, copied, modified, and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  modified  insufficiently for  our  purposes;\r\n\r\ncopied  from  the British, Westminster  pattern,  but\r\n\r\nmodified  inadequately. We have got to find  our  own\r\n\r\nstyle.  We  have got to be bold enough to experiment.\r\n\r\nWe  do not say in approval \"Hear. Hear\" because  that\r\n\r\nis  not  what Singaporeans say. They are not supposed\r\n\r\nto  clap in the British House of Commons. Maybe  ,the\r\n\r\nAustralians;  the New Zealanders, they do  not  clap.\r\n\r\nBut  I have been in the Lok Sabha, which is the Lower\r\n\r\nHouse  in  India.  At  any one time  there  are  1 5\r\n\r\nspeakers on their feet, literally. The Speaker points\r\n\r\nto  one  person, and he is the one that goes  on  the\r\n\r\nofficial  record. But 14 others are going merrily  on\r\n\r\nat the same time. In 1971, my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law, was with me in my journey to India, when  we\r\n\r\nmet  the retired Speaker, who had become Governor  of\r\n\r\nthe  State  in  which Jaipur is,  Rajasthan.  He  was\r\n\r\nwriting a book about his experiences, the humour  and\r\n\r\nthe humourous times he had. His successor was another\r\n\r\nSikh, turbaned gentleman, more robust physically.  (I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know if he could have been as robust as  the\r\n\r\nelderly  gentleman  he succeeded).  I  asked  him  in\r\n\r\nDelhi,  December  1971, whether  things  were  better\r\n\r\nthen. He said, \"Yes, only 12 people speak at the same\r\n\r\ntime.\" Maybe the state of emergency in India has made\r\n\r\nit  possible for the Lok Sabha to have one speaker at\r\n\r\none time. We must have some order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me explain the problems that we face, by\r\n\r\nfirst  reading an excerpt from a book  written  by  a\r\n\r\nBritish  left-wing  Minister  who  started  the  free\r\n\r\nhealth  service scheme in Britain, Aneurin Bevan.  He\r\n\r\nis  dead. I had the privilege of knowing him  and  he\r\n\r\ngave me this book. It was published in 1952, entitled\r\n\r\n\"In  Place  of  Fear\". On page 6,  he  described  his\r\n\r\nexperience and the dangers of a Britisher or Welshman\r\n\r\nin his case, going into Parliament:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`His (the MP's( first impression is that he is in a\r\n\r\nchurch the stained glass windows, the rows of statues\r\n\r\nof  great  statesmen of the past, the echoing  halls,\r\n\r\nthe   soft-footed   attendants  and   the   whispered\r\n\r\nconversation, contrast depressingly with the  crowded\r\n\r\n`meetings and the clang and clash of hot opinions  he\r\n\r\nhas  just left behind in his ejection campaign.  Here\r\n\r\nhe  is, a tribune of the people, coming to make  his\r\n\r\nvoice  heard in the seats of power, instead, it seems\r\n\r\nhe is expected to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406.</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworship;  and the most conservative of all  religions\r\n\r\n-- ancestor worship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he should bear in mind is that these\r\n\r\nwere not his ancestors [namely, the working class. He\r\n\r\nis  talking  now as a Welsh miner or a descendant  of\r\n\r\none.]  His  forebears had no part in the  past, the\r\n\r\naccumulated  dust  of  which  now  muffles  his   own\r\n\r\nfootfalls.  His  forefathers were  tending  sheep  or\r\n\r\nploughing  the  land, or serving the statesmen  whose\r\n\r\nnames  he  sees written on the walls around  him,  or\r\n\r\nwhose  portraits  look  down upon  him  in  the  long\r\n\r\ncorridors,  It  is not the past of  his  people  that\r\n\r\nextends  in colourful pageantry before his eyes  They\r\n\r\nwere  shut Out from all this: were forbidden to  take\r\n\r\npart   in  the  dramatic  scenes  depicted  in  these\r\n\r\nfrescoes.  In him his people are there for the  first\r\n\r\ntime, and the history he will make will not merely be\r\n\r\nan  episode in the story he is now reading, [that is,\r\n\r\nhim]. It must be wholly different:\r\n\r\nas  different  as is the social Status which  he  now\r\n\r\nbrings with him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  epilogue I read at Fullerton Square when Mr  Roy\r\n\r\nJenkins gave up his seat, left the British Parliament\r\n\r\nto  become President of the EEC Commission,  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  debates and parliamentary  triumphs  were\r\n\r\nmeaningless, that changes in government do not  bring\r\n\r\nabout  fundamental  changes of  economic  and  social\r\n\r\npolicies   that  have  set  in,  that   a   successor\r\n\r\ngovernment  inherits  all the mistakes  and  all  the\r\n\r\npolicies of its predecessor and takes a long time  to\r\n\r\nunwind  itself, untangle itself, from what has  been.\r\n\r\nBut Aneurin Bevan writing this before 1952 was not to\r\n\r\nknow the epilogue. He urges his young Labour MPs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to preserve the keen edge of his critical judgment\r\n\r\nhe  will  find  that  he must adopt  an  attitude  of\r\n\r\nscepticism   amounting  almost   to   cynicism,   for\r\n\r\nParliamentary procedure neglects nothing which  might\r\n\r\nsoften the acerbities of class feelings. In one sense\r\n\r\nthe House of Commons is the most unrepresentative  of\r\n\r\nrepresentative   assemblies.  It  is   an   elaborate\r\n\r\nconspiracy to prevent the real clash of opinion which\r\n\r\nexists  outside  from  finding  an  appropriate  echo\r\n\r\nwithin  its  walls.  It  is a social  shock  absorber\r\n\r\nplaced  between privilege and the pressure of popular\r\n\r\ndiscontent,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Member's first experience of this is when he\r\n\r\nlearns  that  passionate  feelings  must  never  find\r\n\r\nexpression  in  forthright speech. His  first  speech\r\n\r\nteaches  him that [That is your duty. Mr  Speaker,  l\r\n\r\nHaving   come   straight  from   contact   with   his\r\n\r\nconstituents, he is full of their grievances and  his\r\n\r\nown  resentment, and naturally, he does his  best  to\r\n\r\nshock his listeners into some realisation of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He delivers himself therefore with great force and,\r\n\r\nhe     hopes    and    fears,    with    considerable\r\n\r\nprovocativeness. When his opponent arises to reply he\r\n\r\nexpects  to hear an equally strong and uncompromising\r\n\r\nanswer His\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopponent   does  nothing  of  the  sort   in   strict\r\n\r\nconformity    with   Parliamentary   tradition, he\r\n\r\ncongratulates  the new Member upon a most  successful\r\n\r\nmaiden speech and expresses the urbane hope that  the\r\n\r\nHouse will have frequent opportunities of hearing him\r\n\r\nin  the future The Members present endorse this quite\r\n\r\ninsincere  sentiment with murmurs of  approval.  With\r\n\r\nthat, his opponent pays no more attention to him, but\r\n\r\ngoes  on  to  deliver the speech he had  intended  to\r\n\r\nmake.  After  remaining in the seat a little  longer,\r\n\r\nthe  new Member crawls out of the House with feelings\r\n\r\nof deep relief at having got it over, mingled with  a\r\n\r\nparalysing sense of frustration, The stone he thought\r\n\r\nhe had thrown turned out to be a sponge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have bothered to describe this typical\r\n\r\nexperience of a working man speaking in the House  of\r\n\r\nCommons for the first time were it not characteristic\r\n\r\nof  the  whole  atmosphere The classic  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nstyle  of  speech is understatement  It  is  a  style\r\n\r\nunsuited  to  the  representative of  working  people\r\n\r\nbecause it slurs and mutes the deep antagonism  which\r\n\r\nexist in society\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have not, fortunately, inherited the British\r\n\r\nEmpire.  We  have inherited a very small fragment  of\r\n\r\nit. We have not the deep class antagonism, but if  we\r\n\r\ndo not bring out these differences of opinion, and if\r\n\r\nwe  had not done so successfully since 1965 when  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis MPs walked out of this Chamber, I do\r\n\r\nnot believe that in February, 1968, in September 1972\r\n\r\nand  again  in  December 1976,  we  could  have  been\r\n\r\nreturned unanimously and completely. So, when in  his\r\n\r\nyouthful zest and enthusiasm, the Member for Kim Seng\r\n\r\nand   that   is  also  a  convention  which   British\r\n\r\nnewspapers have dropped because nobody knows who  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kim Seng is they know Dr Ong Leong  Boon,\r\n\r\nthey  know  him and they will get to know him  better\r\n\r\nand  better  as the years go by. This is a  marathon,\r\n\r\nnot a hundred yards spurt. With every passjng speech,\r\n\r\nwith every passing act, the character, the style, the\r\n\r\nstrength, the weaknesses are etched in the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe  public. You can do a PR job, as has been written\r\n\r\nin  American  books after the making  of  presidents,\r\n\r\nwhere  you  have  a vast electorate  of  200  million\r\n\r\npeople  with over 120 million potential voters,  with\r\n\r\nthe  help of radio and TV, and you suddenly find with\r\n\r\na  whole host of ghost writers and advisers, that the\r\n\r\nman  becomes  scholarly, learned, solicitous  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech. Catch him at a press conference and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion and answer session, where the ghosts  cannot\r\n\r\nwhisper to him, and the man is betrayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when Dr Ong Leong Boon, the Member for Kim Seng,\r\n\r\ninvited  public debate and public discussion,  forums\r\n\r\non  television, I say. \"Choose your partners and pick\r\n\r\nyour  opponents.\" And I think he even tried. Not very\r\n\r\nmany,  but  he and a few others, have praised  me  in\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches,  praised Dr Toh, never  attacked  Dr\r\n\r\nGoh. The Chinese saying goes: ruan de qi ying de pa -\r\n\r\nBully the soft, keep clear of the tough. Because  you\r\n\r\ncan be hurt and he does not want to be hurt. But life\r\n\r\nconsists of both the soft and the hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many issues have been raised. It is the aftermath of\r\n\r\nan  election  campaign. I heard my  own  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  yesterday.  He  was  in  good  form.  He   had\r\n\r\nrecovered. I was proud of him. It is the old Ya'acob,\r\n\r\nwhose  voice nearly fully restored despite  nearly  a\r\n\r\nfatal  loss to the oratorical powers that we have  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. He may not impress the Gallery up  there\r\n\r\nbecause the Malay speaking audience is not there. But\r\n\r\nif  you go down to Geylang Serai, you will need  Haji\r\n\r\nYa'acob because he has a style panache they call it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to remind Members is this:\r\n\r\nthat  we  take them seriously, and over ~  period  of\r\n\r\ntime  we  begin to take some MPs more seriously  than\r\n\r\nothers, because they have done their homework. It  is\r\n\r\na  question of getting to know them, familiarity over\r\n\r\na long stretch of time. It has its advantages and its\r\n\r\ndisadvantages. I take the Member for Katong seriously\r\n\r\nwhen he speaks. He has done his homework. He tries to\r\n\r\npresent  it  logically,  forcefully,  humourously.  I\r\n\r\nthink  Joe  Conceicao has now gone through  simulated\r\n\r\nfire.  He  has  won  an  election.  He  was  returned\r\n\r\nunopposed in 1968. They were so scared of him in 1972\r\n\r\nthat  he was again returned unopposed. But this  time\r\n\r\nthey  were  foolhardy  enough  to  take  him  on.   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are a few others like him. It would be\r\n\r\ninvidious but I think I ought to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmention  Dr  Chiang  Hai Ding,  the  Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan,  and  my own former Political  Secretary.  Dr\r\n\r\nAugustine  Tan. \"Former\" I think he knows the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy, and I do. When he is in form, he is first class.\r\n\r\nYes, he  is.  But  I am a hard task-master.  I  want\r\n\r\nsomebody to be in top form, in top gear all the  time\r\n\r\nbecause  nothing  less  will suffice.  Because  if  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  engine  is  working  on   all   8\r\n\r\ncylinders, and when I press it it is working on 3,  I\r\n\r\nam in deep trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is really so simple, yet it has been\r\n\r\nsolved  only a few times in a few countries and  only\r\n\r\nover  certain periods of time a one-man one-vote,  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  group of men who can provide a continuity\r\n\r\nin  good government, change of policies, flexibility,\r\n\r\nto  reflect  the changing moods of an electorate.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, you need a wide spread, a wide  variety\r\n\r\nrepresenting all types, reflective and representative\r\n\r\nof  the population. And that is why we are here.  But\r\n\r\nfrom amongst us, most of us, or perhaps I can say all\r\n\r\nof  us, speak more than one language or you would not\r\n\r\nbe  here. You may not speak the second language  well\r\n\r\nbut  you understand what is being said. You know what\r\n\r\nyour  constituents  want. You know  what  it  is  all\r\n\r\nabout. Therefore, I am a little disappointed to  find\r\n\r\npeople who have gone through this process questioning\r\n\r\nthe wisdom of demanding minimum pass standards in the\r\n\r\nsecond  language.  This  is Singapore.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  It is Mr Sia, Member  for  Moulmein,\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Bedok wants a commission of  inquiry\r\n\r\ninto schools. And there are quite a few others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain briefly and simply for the new\r\n\r\nMembers. Language, culture, and religion in a  multi-racial,  multi-lingual, multi-religious  and  multi-ethnic  society, with one-man one-vote, can  lead  to\r\n\r\ngreat  tragedy. As it has, in the case of  India  and\r\n\r\nPakistan  a  division  of  the  country.  And  again.\r\n\r\nbetween East and West Pakistan, both Muslim, but  one\r\n\r\nBengali-speaking  and  the  other  Urdu-speaking.  In\r\n\r\nIndia  itself, as it breaks up into various  language\r\n\r\nprovinces, or states. And in Canada, after nearly 200\r\n\r\nyears of British\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconquest  of  Quebec, the Quebecois  are  talking  of\r\n\r\nseparate independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played one-man one-vote, it is very significant. Not\r\n\r\none  single Chinese educated Member of this House has\r\n\r\nquestioned the wisdom of that move. It is the English\r\n\r\neducated  and  the Malay educated. I think  it  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  tribute. I take it as, a great tribute  to  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and myself. And this, is not a  joke.  At\r\n\r\nevery election, the same issue crops up - the killing\r\n\r\nof  Chinese language, culture, civilisation. We  have\r\n\r\nheard  it before. Maybe Mr Tan Soo Khoon, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Alexandra,  now 27, would not  have  known  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  riots! 30,000 to 50,000  Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschool  students camped in Chinese High  School.  The\r\n\r\nplace  was  surrounded by riot police. Mr  Tan  would\r\n\r\nhave  been four years old then. I think it  is  worth\r\n\r\nrecounting  that. Oompah! Merdeka! Oompah!  Merdeka!,\r\n\r\nthey  chanted,  and they formed a  circle  round  the\r\n\r\npolicemen  and danced round them. I was  their  legal\r\n\r\nadviser. I was legal adviser to the Singapore Chinese\r\n\r\nMiddle School Students Union - zhong xue lien (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).\r\n\r\nA  boy  got  scalded with a cauldron of  boiling  hot\r\n\r\nwater. They were afraid - the comrades were afraid of\r\n\r\nwhat  would  happen  if  the parents  discovered  it,\r\n\r\nbecause the parents would then descend on the  campus\r\n\r\nand  pull  all their children home. The  boy  was  in\r\n\r\ngreat  pain. They were wanting me to find  a  way  to\r\n\r\nsmuggle a doctor in. But, unlike Mr G. Raman who very\r\n\r\nunwisely   misconstrued  the  constitution   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore Students' Union,  I  assumed\r\n\r\nthat the Special Branch then under the control of the\r\n\r\nBritish, would have a very shrewd idea of what  would\r\n\r\ntranspire  between the students and me. I  gave  them\r\n\r\nvery  correct advice. I said the right  thing  to  do\r\n\r\nwould  be  to ask the police for permission to  bring\r\n\r\nthe  boy  to  hospital, failing which to  ask  for  a\r\n\r\ndoctor  to go in, but not to smuggle one in. And  the\r\n\r\nbest thing to do was to do it quickly before the  boy\r\n\r\ndies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we are beginning to become one\r\n\r\npeople,  very  slowly, very gradually.  Let  us  not\r\n\r\nforget that those of us who read the Chinese papers - (I do not know how many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo with the English educated.

The\r\n\r\nHokkiens  have  the  vote, and they  count  how  many\r\n\r\nHokkiens   and  say.  \"All  right,  you   have   that\r\n\r\nrepresentative on the committee.\" The  Teochews,  the\r\n\r\nCantonese,  the Hainanese, the Shanghainese  and  the\r\n\r\nHakkas - they are not one Chinese, they are different\r\n\r\nChinese.

I  was\r\n\r\nmentioning that the Ministry of Education was not the\r\n\r\nmost popular of portfolios. And I would like to pay a\r\n\r\ntribute,  if  I may, to my former Cabinet  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Geylang West, Mr Yong Nyuk  Lin.  He\r\n\r\ntook  on the job where angels fear to tread. He moved\r\n\r\nin.  I  often wondered whether he knew how many  land\r\n\r\nmines there were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of play has been made of the number of\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  Education in the  last.  17  years.  I\r\n\r\nthink,  after a while, a debating point, if  repeated\r\n\r\nand   not  rebutted  becomes  part  of  the  accepted\r\n\r\nmythology.  I  think  I  must rebut  it,  break  this\r\n\r\ndebating point and consign it to the rubbish heap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong held this office from June 1959 to October\r\n\r\n1963, four years and four months. Then Mr  Ong  Pang\r\n\r\nBoon  took over because it was a political hot potato\r\n\r\nand  I  needed someone with a fair, but  not  a  low,\r\n\r\nmelting  point.  And Mr Ong took it on  from  October\r\n\r\n1963  till  September 1970 - seven years  he  was  in\r\n\r\ncharge.  It was still a \"hot potato\" Then  he,  after\r\n\r\nseven years, got stale in education. I had Mr Lim Kim\r\n\r\nSan  take over from September 1970 to September 1972,\r\n\r\ntwo  years. Four years, seven years, two years.  Then\r\n\r\nDr  Lee Chiaw Meng took over from September 1972 till\r\n\r\nJune  1975, nearly three years. So up till June  1975\r\n\r\nthere  were  only four Ministers of Education  in  16\r\n\r\nyears. And not only that. There was continuity in the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries. From 1959 to 1963 there was  a\r\n\r\nseries   of   changes:   Lee  Siow   Mong,   Hoffman,\r\n\r\nAmbiavagar. S.C. Thong. Mr Yong Nyuk Lin went through\r\n\r\nfour  Permanent Secretaries. They probably found  the\r\n\r\ngoing  too  tough. Then Kwan Sai Kheong, and  William\r\n\r\nCheng now in Labour. William Cheng was in the Special\r\n\r\nBranch before he moved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  with  Mr  Ong to Education in October 1963.  They\r\n\r\nstayed  on  right up till 1972. No change  in  nearly\r\n\r\nnine full years. No change in Permanent Secretary  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind Members of the changes that took\r\n\r\nplace.  In  1959  the PAP came in -  multilingualism.\r\n\r\nfour  official languages. And for Mr P.  Govindaswamy\r\n\r\nwe  keep a translator, special for him, in Tamil. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson is costing the House more than  any\r\n\r\nother Member of this House. He can speak English. But\r\n\r\nhe  exercises  his  right to speak  in  Tamil  and  I\r\n\r\nrespect the right, as we must. It is written  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution. Malay is the national language and four\r\n\r\nofficial languages. We were going into Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members, if I may, of the percentages\r\n\r\nof  Primary  1 registration figures for the  English,\r\n\r\nChinese. Malay and Tamil streams. I will not give the\r\n\r\ntotal  numbers.  This will probably be  published  in\r\n\r\ntomorrow's  papers. For 1960, the figures  were:  for\r\n\r\nall  races,  51% in the English stream;  39%  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream; 8% Malay stream; 0.23% Tamil stream.\r\n\r\nThen  came merger and Malaysia. Remember 1963? Famous\r\n\r\nday that was. The Malay stream jumped up. It had been\r\n\r\ngoing  down  from 8.6% to 7.8%, it went  up  in  1962\r\n\r\n8.41%;  1964  8.84%; 1965, in Malaysia,  8.94%.  Then\r\n\r\ncame  separation and independence. In 1966 the  Malay\r\n\r\nstream registered a decline from 8.94% to 6.76% - one-quarter  immediately. The Chinese  stream  went  down\r\n\r\nfrom  39% in 1960, to 29% in 1963. Then it went  down\r\n\r\nto  27% in 1964. After Separation (1965), in 1966  it\r\n\r\nwas  32%, up 5%. But, in terms of Chinese alone, that\r\n\r\nwould  be a jump from 37.6% in 1964 to 44.9% in 1966.\r\n\r\nThis  is sufficient of the past - 10 years, 11 really\r\n\r\n-  for  me to talk about it without arousing passions\r\n\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, before registration of students, the\r\n\r\nChinese  press mounts a campaign, and  we  let  them.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two ways of doing this, by  edict  or  by\r\n\r\nvoluntary choice. And had we done the stupid thing by\r\n\r\nedict and said, \"You will learn two languages and you\r\n\r\nwill learn English as one of the two\", I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore would have gone a different way.  We  would\r\n\r\nbe  speaking Chinese in this Chamber. And I think  my\r\n\r\nMandarin would be fairly fluent by now, instead of my\r\n\r\nHokkien becoming more fluent than my Mandarin because\r\n\r\nI have to make speeches in Hokkien outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read the figures from 1966 after independence\r\n\r\nto  1976  -  10  years. English -  from  60%  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  it has gone up in this year's entrance  in\r\n\r\nPrimary I to 86%. From 60% to 86%. Chinese went  down\r\n\r\nfrom   a  high  of  33%  in  1967, two  years  after\r\n\r\nseparation,  to 13.75% this year. Malay in  1966  was\r\n\r\n6.76%,  this year it is 0.19% that is for  the  small\r\n\r\nislands  -  Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin,  -  where  they\r\n\r\ncannot  get  English  schools. Tamil  since  1975,  I\r\n\r\nregret  to inform the Member for Anson, is 0.0%.  But\r\n\r\nnever  fear,  they are learning Tamil in the  English\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nTamil  students  are not allowed to register  in  the\r\n\r\nschools.  So  how can we get the Tamil  students?  We\r\n\r\nmust allow them to register. But we do not allow them\r\n\r\nto be registered. It says, \"Only Malay or Chinese\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a lot of\r\n\r\ntime  for  the Member for Anson. Of course, we  allow\r\n\r\nthem to register in any school where there is a Tamil\r\n\r\nteacher.  We  cannot have Tamil teachers where  there\r\n\r\nare no Tamil students, and we cannot have three Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents  with one Tamil teacher. So we have  got  to\r\n\r\ngroup  the  Tamil  students in the best  schools  for\r\n\r\nTamil.  I  assure him that it is our  intention  that\r\n\r\nwhoever  becomes  a Tamil orator in this  House  will\r\n\r\nalways find a following outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they say, \"seven Ministers\", it is not true.\r\n\r\nWhat  happened was, in June 1975. Dr Lee  Chiaw  Meng\r\n\r\nhaving   had  three  years,  moved  over  to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I asked Dr Toh Chin Chye to  take  over.\r\n\r\nBut  I  wanted Mr Chai Chong Yii to run it  under  Dr\r\n\r\nToh's  supervision.  Dr Toh said,  \"Either  I  am  in\r\n\r\ncharge or I am not.\" In which case I said, \"Right.  I\r\n\r\nwill  be  in charge.\" So after 14 days I took charge.\r\n\r\n16th June, 1975\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  an  announcement to say that I was  in  charge.\r\n\r\nThen  I  went into it. I had this advantage over  all\r\n\r\nthe other Ministers. I had the feedback from the army\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am  on a special committee  called  Delco\r\n\r\nwhich monitors what is happening. I am also aware  of\r\n\r\nwhat is happening in Labour for jobs. But never mind.\r\n\r\njust   Defco  alone  was  enough.  We  had   national\r\n\r\nservicemen. We had instructors ready: in English  for\r\n\r\nthose who spoke English, Mandarin for those who spoke\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay for those who spoke Malay, and  Tamil\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  spoke Tamil. They  failed  in  large\r\n\r\nnumbers.  We  did not know why. I used  to  go  round\r\n\r\nNational  Day dinners where national servicemen  were\r\n\r\ninvited.  I spoke to them in Mandarin and in  English\r\n\r\n-blank.  I  spoke to them in Hokkien - Ah  ha,  their\r\n\r\nfaces  lit up. Sometimes even in Hokkien they do  not\r\n\r\nlight  up.  <i>yi  si  buay hiau  kong  a-m'ng  wei</i> ()\r\n\r\n- big trouble. So we  grouped  Hokkien\r\n\r\nplatoons  with  Hokkien instructors, and  immediately\r\n\r\nthe  marksmanship went up from 30% to 95%,  equal  to\r\n\r\nall  the  others. So the instruction  was  wrong.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, automatic promotion was wrong. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwho  made  that point. I think it was the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Congratulations. But remember\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Yong  Nyuk  Lin  was  having  the  4-2-3-3,\r\n\r\nremember  the  3-3-4-2  issue  -three  years   junior\r\n\r\nmiddle,  three  years  senior middle.  He  wanted  to\r\n\r\nchange  it  and make it equal to the English  stream,\r\n\r\nfour  years  secondary. \"O\" levels, two  years  post-secondary,      \"A\"      levels.      Oompah!Merdeka!\r\n\r\nOompah!Merdeka!, Strikes - <i>ba ke</i>() <i>ba  kao</i>(),\r\n\r\nwhich    means    boycott   lessons,   and    boycott\r\n\r\nexaminations.  I think we have to publish  all  these\r\n\r\nwith  pictures  complete.  It  should  be  compulsory\r\n\r\nreading  for  all  new  MPs. I  think  it  should  be\r\n\r\ncompulsory  reading for all University undergraduates\r\n\r\nand  all  teachers because suddenly even  I  had  not\r\n\r\nrealised  that  in 1954 the Member for Alexandra  was\r\n\r\nfour years old! But we could not change. Mr Yong Nyuk\r\n\r\nLin's problem was that we had promised a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace in school for every child. So it was a logistic\r\n\r\nproblem.  We  doubled the schools by  a  morning  and\r\n\r\nafternoon  session,  doubled  the  intake,  recruited\r\n\r\nteachers  by  the droves. Of course, the standard  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  went down. We had lecturers in the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College who spoke English learnt in  Madras.\r\n\r\nThe students had difficulty in understanding what the\r\n\r\nteacher  was  saying.  He  could  not  speak  Queen's\r\n\r\nEnglish,  but  better some English than  no  English.\r\n\r\nBetter  \"Yes, man\" than <i>\"Buay hiau lah\"</i>().  That\r\n\r\nis big trouble. We solved the logistics problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the political problem in 1963 which Mr Ong\r\n\r\nPang  Boon, as Minister, took over. We had gone  into\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Education was a separate  State-autonomous\r\n\r\nsubject, and we knew there were going to be problems.\r\n\r\nJust  think what would have happened if we were still\r\n\r\nin   Malaysia?  I  ask  Members  to  sit   back   and\r\n\r\ncontemplate.  I  would not go further.  Many  Members\r\n\r\nhave been on parliamentary delegations. But how would\r\n\r\nthe  State-autonomous  authority  on  Education  have\r\n\r\nfitted  in  with the overall policy from the  Federal\r\n\r\ncapital?  How about the employment problem with  jobs\r\n\r\nin government, jobs in the private sector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think this education policy was a resounding\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  political  terms.  This  move  was  long\r\n\r\noverdue  but we were so preoccupied with the problems\r\n\r\nof  survival. As Dr Goh told me happily once, I think\r\n\r\nit  was  not  very long after independence  when  our\r\n\r\nbattalion came back from Sabah and they had no  camps\r\n\r\nto  move into. Half the battalion were supposed to be\r\n\r\nour  battalion. Dr Goh said to me. \"You know, you are\r\n\r\nlike  a British Prime Minister being protected  by  a\r\n\r\nregiment  that is half Italian. And we  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  will happen.\" We survived that. But gently does\r\n\r\nit  and firmly. I am proud to say we made it. We made\r\n\r\nit.  We  have  got  a Singapore Army  which  includes\r\n\r\nSingapore  English speaking. Chinese speaking.  Malay\r\n\r\nspeaking  and a few Tamil speaking. But they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to win votes, so they speak English in the  SAF\r\n\r\nThey all can, as the Member for Anson can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during this period that I went into it and\r\n\r\ndecided no. I had the advantage of the feedback  from\r\n\r\nboth Labour and the army. I went into it and sat down\r\n\r\nfor  months and sent, with the Chairman of the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, a team of officers to implement a\r\n\r\nnew  policy  made  possible only because  our  family\r\n\r\nplanning policy had worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members go back to the 1959 projections, we would\r\n\r\nbe  having 70,000 to 75,000 babies born a year  today\r\n\r\nbecause the rate of increase was 4% per annum.  Today\r\n\r\nit  is  just over 1%. Last year, the Dragon Year,  it\r\n\r\nwent  up.  I  expect this year to show a commensurate\r\n\r\ndecline,  to make up for last year's excess.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat it is not popular with seven Catholic MPs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really remarkable. I only knew when Members\r\n\r\ntook the oath. So I did a count. There are 1 5 out of\r\n\r\n69  who were sworn in on the Bible. 15 out of  69  is\r\n\r\n21.75%   of   the   population  of  this   House.   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Christians. The missionaries  did  a\r\n\r\ngood  job  in  producing  leader-men.  But  in  total\r\n\r\npopulation the Christians are only about 9%.  21%  in\r\n\r\nthis  House representing 9% outside. I think the next\r\n\r\ntime  we interview candidates we are going to have  a\r\n\r\ncloser look. Ah! but that is not the whole story.  We\r\n\r\nhave  got  seven  Catholics, and they  are  all  good\r\n\r\nCatholics.  I know the Papal bull - when I  say  \"the\r\n\r\nPapal  bull\", I am not saying that in jest.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat is the technical term, is it not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whatever it is, the\r\n\r\nPope    issues    his   interpretation,    and    the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  is that you can only  do  it  by  the\r\n\r\nrhythm method. Well. I wish all Catholics have a good\r\n\r\nsense of rhythm. Seven Catholics make up 10% of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, more  than  10%.  69 Members  and  seven  are\r\n\r\nCatholics and they are less than 4% of the population\r\n\r\nSo the next time we have got to have another question\r\n\r\n``what   denomination?\"  before  we  find   ourselves\r\n\r\noutvoted   on   a   free   vote   on   abortion   and\r\n\r\nsterilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me come back to the realities. There was no\r\n\r\nother way than bilingualism. By\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nedict,  one-man one-vote means the Chinese  language.\r\n\r\nThis  is a Chinese-speaking Singapore with the Malays\r\n\r\nand the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a great admiration for the three new MPs - the Member for Kallang (Mr Dhanabalan), the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kolam  Ayer (Encik Sidek Saniff) and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kembangan (Encik Mansor Sukaimi). I have\r\n\r\napproved  that  they be given Mandarin teachers.  But\r\n\r\nlet me tell them what a French, but English-speaking,\r\n\r\nbrain  surgeon in Canada has written. He  wrote  this\r\n\r\nbecause  he  was  studying the problem  of  Canadians\r\n\r\nlearning French at the same time as English. It is an\r\n\r\narticle  of only 12 pages, and I commend  it  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Katong.  He is an  avid  reader  and  an\r\n\r\neducated man. My definition of an educated man  is  a\r\n\r\nman who never stops learning and wants to learn. I am\r\n\r\nnot interested in whether a man has a PH.D or not, or\r\n\r\nan  MA, for that matter, or a diploma. Mao never  had\r\n\r\none;  neither  had Khrushchev; nor Stalin.  But  this\r\n\r\nbrain  surgeon. Dr Wilder, writing in a volume called\r\n\r\n\"Brain\".  Volume  88 (1965) pages  787  to  798  (12\r\n\r\npages)  Dr  Wilder Penfield, a Canadian neurosurgeon.\r\n\r\ndiscovered,   watching   his   children   and   doing\r\n\r\nexperiments  on other children that in a right-handed\r\n\r\nchild  the left temporal lobe of the brain cortex  is\r\n\r\noften  used to learn the mother tongue and the  right\r\n\r\ntemporal  lobe  the  other  languages.  Learning   of\r\n\r\nlanguages by a child must be done before the  age  of\r\n\r\n12  years  when  the cortex is still  uncommitted  to\r\n\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every diplomat who has his children educated in\r\n\r\nvarious parts of the world, will confirm this - and I\r\n\r\nconfirm it from my own experience - that when you get\r\n\r\na child to learn a language he picks it up naturally.\r\n\r\nA  language is heard and spoken by a child  from  the\r\n\r\nmother, long before he learns to read and write. They\r\n\r\nare  two different functions. You hear and you speak.\r\n\r\nAt  a later stage you see the symbol, you read it and\r\n\r\nyou reproduce it, you write - two separate functions.\r\n\r\nI  learnt some Chinese as a child. But if you do  not\r\n\r\npersist  in the language, as diplomats will tell  you\r\n\r\nabout  their children - when they get posted out  too\r\n\r\nearly, the children lose it and lose it forever.  But\r\n\r\nif the language is learnt till\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  the  late teens, 18 or 16, it  is  there  for\r\n\r\nlife, for keeps. I learnt it the hard way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has the rare and doubtful\r\n\r\ndistinction  of  writing,  ghost-writing, my   first\r\n\r\nChinese  speech.  I  stood out at  what  is  now  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Theatre. It was an open field - qun zhung da\r\n\r\nhui (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)20,000 people turned up and I debated\r\n\r\nwhether I should read it in Cantonese or in Mandarin.\r\n\r\nQuite  a  problem.  My opponent challenged  me  to  a\r\n\r\ndebate either in Mandarin, Hakka, Cantonese, Hokkien.\r\n\r\nName  it,  he  is ready. He is now a very  successful\r\n\r\ntextile  merchant. You never really learn  until  you\r\n\r\nknow that you have got to use it. From that day on, I\r\n\r\nhave  never  ceased to learn. That is  more  than  20\r\n\r\nyears.  And  I had been learning before  that.  After\r\n\r\nthat.  I learnt with a passion, which could not  have\r\n\r\nbeen there but for this traumatic experience - 20,000\r\n\r\npeople  to  hear  my kindergarten Mandarin.  Quite  a\r\n\r\nshock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between my children and me is that\r\n\r\nwhen  I  switch to Mandarin I am like  an  old  valve\r\n\r\nradio  -  you know, the old valve radio  or  TV?  The\r\n\r\ndifference between a transistor TV and a valve TV? An\r\n\r\nold  valve TV, once you switch on, takes two to three\r\n\r\nminutes to warm up. Then you get the sound. Then  you\r\n\r\nget  into  the  mood. Then you switch  on  to  a  new\r\n\r\ncircuit,  from AC to DC from 220 volts to 110  volts.\r\n\r\nBut  with my children, you switch on, you just  press\r\n\r\nthe button it is on, instant. And if they stop at 12.\r\n\r\nit  is  compulsory. You cannot get into  a  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  unless you pass your second language. And  if\r\n\r\nthey  stop, and they do, they are bright, they  score\r\n\r\none's. The present system is simple: you get under 20\r\n\r\npoints  for  the five best subjects  and  you  go  to\r\n\r\nJunior College. Am I right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

So  what  do  they  do?  They   score   in\r\n\r\nmathematics,    additional   mathematics,    physics,\r\n\r\nchemistry, one  other. Does not need  swotting.  You\r\n\r\nknow, they are bright lads. English, just a pass does\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter. 6, 7 or 8; Chinese fail. Well, all right, it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter, it is not included. We have  given\r\n\r\nthem three years' notice. They are now in Sec 2,  now\r\n\r\nswot.  And  I  bet you, in six years'  time  we  will\r\n\r\nproduce  `A' level graduates who will go  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsimultaneous   interpreters'  room  and   outdo   the\r\n\r\nsimultaneous interpreters. Because I am  quite  sure.\r\n\r\nThe   simultaneous  interpreters,  after  this   long\r\n\r\ninterval since our last meeting, they are like  valve\r\n\r\nradios,  whereas we are now going to produce students\r\n\r\nwith `transistors'. And they are bright, they will do\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how sharp they are. Maybe it is good,\r\n\r\nmaybe  it  is  not so good. But this is  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration Singaporean. The best scholarship you  can\r\n\r\nget  is  the President's scholarship. If  you  are  a\r\n\r\nPresident's scholar, you are really good. And you  do\r\n\r\nnot  apply for it. After the examination results  are\r\n\r\nknown  for  the  `A' levels, the P.S.C, invites  the\r\n\r\nschool  principals to recommend those who they  think\r\n\r\nshould  be considered. They are considered  not  only\r\n\r\nfor their `A' level results, their `O' level results,\r\n\r\ntheir  ECA  and all the other activities,  leadership\r\n\r\nqualities.  No bonds, nothing. They do  not  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  it.  They  still get a few  hundred  dollars  a\r\n\r\nmonth, a  year. Then comes the SAF scholars.  MINDEF\r\n\r\nhas  spent  billions of dollars in  training  and  in\r\n\r\nhardware.  And the people who have to run MINDEF  and\r\n\r\nmake the decisions were never trained as soldiers.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  highest rank Dr Goh reached was  that  of\r\n\r\nLance  Corporal? Private? A Private in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nVolunteers. And the professional side, 1 and  2  SIR,\r\n\r\nthey were recruited in 1955/56, and again in 1958/59,\r\n\r\nto  be  ceremonial guards for the Istana and to  help\r\n\r\nthe  police  when  the crowds got out  of  control  - internal security exercise. In other words, there was\r\n\r\nnot  the  officer cadre that can run  and  spend  the\r\n\r\nbillions.  And so men have had to be taken  out,  put\r\n\r\nthrough a crash course so that they know what is cost-effectiveness in terms of weapons, training  manuals.\r\n\r\nSo the SAF scholar is critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year there are some 15,000 to 20,000 men in\r\n\r\nthe  reserves, and they are in the reserves right  up\r\n\r\nto 40 years. So you start\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  18 to 40, that is 22 years. Multiply that by  a\r\n\r\nfactor  of  10,000, and not 15,000, you have  220,000\r\n\r\nmen.  Multiply that by 20,000, you get  440,000.  Who\r\n\r\nare they being led by? They are bright men, you know.\r\n\r\nThey  are  top  executives. If  they  know  that  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  only  barely got two `O' levels,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is good for morale. Our generals  will  be\r\n\r\nsome  of  the most able and some of the most resolute\r\n\r\nof  men  with a very high melting point, not wax  but\r\n\r\ntitanium.  It is in a crisis, when the crunch  comes,\r\n\r\nthat  you  make decisions which can cost hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands  of  lives, because we are a  very  compact\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell you how attractive it is. If you are\r\n\r\na  2nd  Lieutenant, you get paid as a 2nd Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nYou  can  choose any university to go to and you  are\r\n\r\npaid all expenses. Do you know what the students have\r\n\r\ndone? They are brought back every summer vacation for\r\n\r\ntraining, but they say, \"That is no good.  We  would\r\n\r\nlike to go holidaying round the continent and see the\r\n\r\nworld.\"  So  they  choose  to  take  a  Colombo  Plan\r\n\r\nScholarship  to Australia. They only  do  two  months\r\n\r\ntraining. January and February, as a recruit and then\r\n\r\nin  March  they  are  off. When  they  come  back  as\r\n\r\nengineers  they are graduates, and they get  paid  as\r\n\r\ngraduate  engineers. We have cut that  off  now.  Not\r\n\r\nonly have we made it that they go the following year,\r\n\r\nand  not  that they pass `A' level last year and  are\r\n\r\ngoing  this February or March. They are going  in  15\r\n\r\nmonths'  time. They will complete the officer cadet's\r\n\r\ncourse, then go, and come back and serve. Immediately\r\n\r\nthey  moved back and said, \"Right, we will  take  the\r\n\r\nSAF.\"  They compete for the SAF scholarship.  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  the slightest doubt that if we carry this on  to\r\n\r\nthe  next  stage, at the `A' levels - that  you  will\r\n\r\nhave, for entrance to the university, a good pass  in\r\n\r\nthe second language - they will pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the reasons why. Now and for a very\r\n\r\nlong time anybody who has any pretensions or any hope\r\n\r\nof becoming a leader has got to know a minimum of two\r\n\r\nlanguages I had before me the circulation figures  of\r\n\r\nthe  English and Chinese newspapers. I can rattle  it\r\n\r\noff from memory. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  produce the exact figures later. 160,000  for\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times, Nanyang, Sin Chew, Sin Min and Min\r\n\r\nPao, 280,000. Assuming that the English educated have\r\n\r\nless  readers per copy - I mean each copy is read  by\r\n\r\nless  people  - it means that if you  want  to  be  a\r\n\r\nMinister and you do not read the Chinese papers, you\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what the ground is thinking and  saying\r\n\r\nand  you are in trouble. Let me say that one  of  the\r\n\r\nduties of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Foreign Affairs was - not now, because  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  (Mr  Rajaratnam) has  now  made  other\r\n\r\narrangements  more systematically - to  read  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister all the politically sensitive items  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers.  So Mr Rajaratnam  was  educated\r\n\r\ninto  the  Chinese mind. Now, of course it  has  been\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised. So the Parliamentary Secretary has\r\n\r\ngot to be found other duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a further reason why it must be so. Let\r\n\r\nme tell the Member for Moulmein, and I say, do not be\r\n\r\nafraid of the argument. I am glad that he raised  it.\r\n\r\nBecause he gives me the opportunity to expound  this.\r\n\r\nA lot of thinking went into this. Way back in 1965 we\r\n\r\nfound  ourselves suddenly independent.  If  you  lose\r\n\r\nthat Chinese education and you go completely English-educated,  you  will  lose  that  drive, that  self-confidence. That is what is wrong. The danger is,  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  Chinese educated and only Chinese educated,\r\n\r\nyou  are  monolingual, then your source of literature\r\n\r\nwill  be communist. That is big trouble. But  if  you\r\n\r\nare  bilingual, you have binocular vision, then  you\r\n\r\nsee the world in 3-D. And I will confirm that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to China last year, May. Many members of the\r\n\r\nparty  spoke  Chinese, were Chinese.  There  was  no\r\n\r\nproblem  of  language. We understood what  was  being\r\n\r\nsaid  and  what  was being written. There  is  a  new\r\n\r\ndiction. Completely different, Of course, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong  is  right: no culture, no  civilisation,\r\n\r\nstands  still.  Or it dies, or it is  mummified.  The\r\n\r\ndifference  between the Chinese in Peking  or  Canton\r\n\r\nand  the Chinese in Singapore is so great as to  make\r\n\r\nit  a  difference  of kind And when  the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is trilingual and he knows of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother different world, a vast world reaching out to\r\n\r\nMars  and  beyond, he listens to all this exposition,\r\n\r\nunderstands  it, but he says to himself, \"Well,  that\r\n\r\nis  one  way  of doing it.\" But in Singapore  we  had\r\n\r\nbetter do it the simpler way. For us, the easier  way\r\n\r\nis  just plug it into the grid. We stand other risks,\r\n\r\nof course, because the grid is already there. You tap\r\n\r\nWestern  science, Western technology, trade with  the\r\n\r\nWest. But when they have a depression, recession  and\r\n\r\nunemployment, we get the rigor. We cannot avoid that.\r\n\r\nWhether  America is in recession or  Europe  has  got\r\n\r\nfive  or  six  million unemployed, it makes  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest difference to China. Self-reliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Zi li geng sheng </i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Is that it? You see, you\r\n\r\nhave  got  to use the phrase everyday to  recall  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a critical decision was made. And  I  say,\r\n\r\ndecision  is  right and must be pursued vigorously  - that if we become a monolingual society, deculturised\r\n\r\nfrom our roots, we are in deep trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain to the Member for Moulmein why we are\r\n\r\nalready  in trouble, In the old days, in the bad  old\r\n\r\ndays, we  had  very  good  workmanship.  Whether  as\r\n\r\ncarpenters or as skilled technicians, they  were  the\r\n\r\njobs  done by the hard-working, industrious, skilled\r\n\r\nChinese-educated,  They were  the  best  fitters  and\r\n\r\ntechnicians - United Engineers, Keppel Shipyard.  The\r\n\r\nCantonese  are  the best. But now they  have  learned\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Like the Member for Ang Mo  Kio,  he  is  a\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  graduate. Why should he  be  doing  work\r\n\r\nwhich should be done by an English educated boy  less\r\n\r\ncompetent  than he is? So, he is a land surveyor.  He\r\n\r\nhas  gone  on  to management. Yes, and  why  not?  He\r\n\r\nspeaks  English now, also plus Chinese. But  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  if he did not start speaking Chinese, he  would\r\n\r\nnot  have learnt his English. I know very few English\r\n\r\neducated  who  can speak Chinese as well  as  he  can\r\n\r\nspeak  English,  I know of some who have  tried  very\r\n\r\nhard.  They have to. You take a Malay and  an  Indian\r\n\r\nand cut him off from the past - what have you got  to\r\n\r\ngive him? If you take him to America and you say.  \"I\r\n\r\nam an American.\" I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow how many saw this Alistair Cook series: \"Are you\r\n\r\na  Communist? No. I have never been a member  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist party. Everyday I swear that I will  defend\r\n\r\nAmerica, be loyal to America, I put my right hand  on\r\n\r\nmy  heart.\" Well, that is a total, complete different\r\n\r\nvalue  system.  Have  we got a total  complete  value\r\n\r\nsystem  to  replace the Confucian system, to  replace\r\n\r\nMalay  culture and values and Islam? P.  Govindaswamy\r\n\r\nwith 3,000 years of his Tamil scripts, is he going to\r\n\r\ngive  that up? I say, \"Very big trouble.\" But if  P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy's  son  decides to emigrate  to  Canada,\r\n\r\nwhich  he  can as a doctor, well, that is  different.\r\n\r\nThen   you  plug  in  into  a  whole  North  American\r\n\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know what is going to happen. The end\r\n\r\nproduct  has got to be partly the decisions we  make,\r\n\r\nbut  also mainly what the interaction will be between\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  a  whole world of literature,  science,\r\n\r\ntechnology, arts, culture, music, the mass media  and\r\n\r\nthe lot, and the basic values of your own self. It is\r\n\r\ncritical.  They took the African, put  him  in  slave\r\n\r\nships  and  brought him to America.  After  ten,  God\r\n\r\nknows  how many generations, this man wanted to  know\r\n\r\nwhence he came from. He wrote about <i>Roots</i>. Joe, have\r\n\r\nyou read it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have. They have made a good\r\n\r\nTV series of it - an American negro with considerable\r\n\r\nWhite  parentage spent years to trace  his  ancestors\r\n\r\nback  in  Sierra  Leone or some place  nearby  called\r\n\r\nKinta or something, and wrote what he called faction,\r\n\r\nnot  fiction, but faction based on facts  but  in  a\r\n\r\nfictional way, because he cannot completely establish\r\n\r\nall  that happened. Tremendous impact on both  whites\r\n\r\nand blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, all the professionals, English-educated, want their children to be professionals.\r\n\r\nAnd  they are very worried when their children cannot\r\n\r\nmake it, Because they have to learn two languages. It\r\n\r\nis  easier  to  make  it if they have  to  learn  one\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Then  you score A's.  You  have  to  learn\r\n\r\nChinese. It is such a difficult language. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  examiners are so strict,  bred  in  the\r\n\r\nimperial examination classical system, that to  score\r\n\r\na  5 in Chinese is five times more difficult than  to\r\n\r\nscore  a  5 in Malay. And, of course, all the  bright\r\n\r\nyoung  sparks decide after a while, \"Really, my  mind\r\n\r\nis not suited for Chinese, I want to learn Malay as a\r\n\r\nsecond  language.\" Yes, it is much  easier.  You  can\r\n\r\nread this. There is no problem at all. It is the same\r\n\r\nromanised  script. And you know, after  a  while,  it\r\n\r\nsays  for taxi,<i> teksi </i>(t-e-k-s-i). Well, that is  all\r\n\r\nright. We will just learn that. Taxi in Chinese, what\r\n\r\nis it? <i>de shi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), that is Singapore, you know,\r\n\r\nonomatopoeic  transliteration.  But   that   is   not\r\n\r\ncorrect. There are no taxis in China. But I will  put\r\n\r\nmy  bottom  dollar on the fact that  when  China  has\r\n\r\ntaxis, it will not be called <i>de shi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). The\r\n\r\nJapanese  are  prepared,  because  they  have  always\r\n\r\nborrowed.  They  have  borrowed their  language  from\r\n\r\nChina,  they have borrowed their technology from  the\r\n\r\nWest  - to their great advantage. But a culture which\r\n\r\ngoes back 4,000 years is too proud to borrow. So  the\r\n\r\nJapanese says for the atom bomb atomo bombo. But  the\r\n\r\nChinese translate it, give it their own name - <i>he  zi\r\n\r\nwu qi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) <i>yuan zi dan</i>( ) - nuclear weapon,\r\n\r\natomic  bomb. You translate the meaning. You call  an\r\n\r\naeroplane, an aeroplane? No. <i>Fei ji</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), flying\r\n\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has its advantages. It has got its dangers.\r\n\r\nBecause   if  the  boy  is  monolingual,   then   the\r\n\r\nliterature  that he has will be more  and  more  only\r\n\r\nfrom  China.  And whether you read the most  innocent\r\n\r\nbook  on  the  beauty of Kwei Lin and its stalagmites\r\n\r\nand   stalactites,  in  between  you  will  get   the\r\n\r\n\"Thoughts\". Yes. It is part of the new evolving value\r\n\r\nsystem.  But  it is a risk we must take. For  another\r\n\r\nreason,  that  those who are at a  disadvantage, who\r\n\r\nlive  in  a  completely dialect-speaking  village  or\r\n\r\nhome, who are not particularly fast in learning, when\r\n\r\nthey  go to school they are learning two foreign,  or\r\n\r\ntwo  new languages, neither of which is their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue, Mandarin and English. When Mr Jek Yeun  Thong\r\n\r\nspeaks Mandarin, I do not have to know that Mr Jek is\r\n\r\nCantonese. I can hear it in the Mandarin.  So  I  can\r\n\r\nfrom   Mr  Lai  Tha  Chai  -  what  they  call  qiang\r\n\r\ndiao(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccent.

In\r\n\r\ncase  the  press gets me wrong, it is psephology  and\r\n\r\nnot  psychology. I have a dictionary here. It is  the\r\n\r\nscience of how people vote.

We trampled Hong Lim for eight  weeks  and\r\n\r\ncanvassed every house, every cubicle, every corner of\r\n\r\nevery  staircase where there was a human being -  six\r\n\r\nto  eight times. And we had lost two Hokkien speakers\r\n\r\n-  orators.  One  was Lim Chin Siong.  He  went  with\r\n\r\nBarisan.  And then we were fighting the man we  built\r\n\r\nup  as  our  Hokkien orator, Mr Ong Eng Guan.  Now  a\r\n\r\ngeneration has grown up not knowing him.  But  he  is\r\n\r\nvery  good. We taught him how to be an orator. I hear\r\n\r\nthat  we have got somebody amongst our 11 new Members\r\n\r\nwho  is prepared to teach how to speak Hokkien. Well,\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing the panache and style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dale Carnegie!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Dale Carnegie? Let me tell you\r\n\r\nthat  I then learnt Hokkien because we decided if  we\r\n\r\nbuild another Hokkien speaker and they do this to us,\r\n\r\nwe  are in big trouble. So I learnt Hokkien. And  let\r\n\r\nme   assure  the  three  Members  who  are   learning\r\n\r\nMandarin: learn Mandarin because no soldier,  no  NSF\r\n\r\nwill say, \"No, I cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nspeak  Mandarin.\" You know, their name  tags  are  in\r\n\r\ndifferent colours so we know what language he speaks.\r\n\r\nBlue for English, pink for Mandarin, red for Hokkien.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a lucky colour. We give them red, they  said.\r\n\r\n\"No, no. I want pink. I am an educated Mandarin.\"  So\r\n\r\nyou  have  now  to examine them because  nobody  will\r\n\r\nconcede  that he cannot speak Mandarin. And it  is  a\r\n\r\ngood base from which to learn Hokkien, if need be.  I\r\n\r\nwill  bear  witness  to that. Because  you  know  the\r\n\r\nclassical. Hokkien is the southern variation  as  the\r\n\r\nChinese  went south and got mixed up with  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nother  people who were there and they got  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nnative  Hokkien words not to be found in the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncharacter  system. Many of them. My mind is cluttered\r\n\r\nup with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I also read in this article by the\r\n\r\nbrain  surgeon that the mind is not like  a  cupboard\r\n\r\nand  therefore you fill up the space.  The  more  the\r\n\r\ninput and the earlier it is, the bigger the capacity.\r\n\r\nI  thought  to myself, what a great shame I  did  not\r\n\r\nknow  that.  If I had listened to my grandmother  and\r\n\r\nslotted all these languages, how much easier it would\r\n\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now meet what I consider is the basic\r\n\r\nproblem. I think Haji Ya'acob bin Mohamed posed  that\r\n\r\nquestion  yesterday. What are we? Is it growth, more\r\n\r\ngrowth,  more  materialism? Just what are  we  doing?\r\n\r\nWhat  do we try to be? Does man live by bread  alone?\r\n\r\nWell,  we  are trying to make a nation,  a  people  - tolerant, considerate, compassionate but rugged or we\r\n\r\nwill  not survive. Because it was never the intention\r\n\r\nof   the  British  that  Singapore  should  ever   be\r\n\r\nindependent. Let me assure all hon Members that  each\r\n\r\ntime  I  swear the oath of allegiance to the Republic\r\n\r\nof Singapore, my mind goes back to the 9th of August.\r\n\r\n1  965. I did not want it. We had independence thrust\r\n\r\nupon us. And the expectation was that in two to three\r\n\r\nyears  we  would be so down on our knees and crawling\r\n\r\nthat  we  would  have to go back  on  any  terms.  No\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  Education, Labour, and  all  the  other\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Different terms. Maybe if they were  kind,\r\n\r\nlike\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca. But we resolved  to  make  this\r\n\r\nwork. Never forget that. It was the will, not just of\r\n\r\na  few  men. That was necessary. But the will was  in\r\n\r\nthe  people. Otherwise it would not have worked. They\r\n\r\nwent  through  the biggest education  Singapore  ever\r\n\r\ngot. It was from September 1963 to August 9, 1965. We\r\n\r\nlearnt what life was about. It also caused two  riots\r\n\r\n-  June  1964, late September 1964. During the second\r\n\r\none  I  was away in Brussels as the guest speaker  at\r\n\r\nthe  centenary  of the Socialist International.  Then\r\n\r\nthey wanted me to explain how bad communism was - the\r\n\r\nCommunists  were  winning in  Southeast  Asia  except\r\n\r\nSingapore. But, alas, the world has changed. Now  the\r\n\r\nSocialist  International has got new activists.  They\r\n\r\nwill not invite me to address them, What is the point\r\n\r\nof  addressing  them anyway? They want  to  dress  me\r\n\r\ndown. They have no use for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Chai Chee (Mr Fong Sip Chee)\r\n\r\nraised a critical question. And I take him seriously.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"We cancel each other out.\" No. He is wrong.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  big  difference  between  culture   and\r\n\r\ncivilisation. First, I quote from the Shorter  Oxford\r\n\r\nDictionary and then quote the Chinese for it. I  have\r\n\r\ngot  the  Chinese definition. \"Civilisation\" that  is\r\n\r\nthe  broader  term,  the  modern  term.  Civilisation\r\n\r\n-civilised  condition or state. And to \"civilise\"  is\r\n\r\nto  bring out of a state of barbarism; to instruct in\r\n\r\nthe  arts  of  life; to enlighten and to  refine;  to\r\n\r\nbecome  civilised. Now \"Culture\" -\"the  training  and\r\n\r\nrefinement   of  mind, tastes,  and   manners;   the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  being thus trained  and  refined;  the\r\n\r\nintellectual  side of civilisation.\" The intellectual\r\n\r\nside  of civilisation, not the technological side.  I\r\n\r\nnow read from Webster's English Dictionary translated\r\n\r\ninto     Chinese.     First,    the     non-communist\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  then  the communist  interpretation.\r\n\r\nBecause I think Joe's point is a very important one - that  nothing is static. We are not the  same  as  we\r\n\r\nwere,  30,  40  years  ago;  nor  any  other  people.\r\n\r\nCivilisation  - <i>Kai hua huo kai hua zhi  zhuang  tai;\r\n\r\nwen  ming</i> () Culture - <i>xin zhi shang  yu\r\n\r\ndao  de  shang you jiao yu er de zhi kai ming yu  pin\r\n\r\nge</i>;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>de yu zhi yu zhi lie guo</i> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).\r\n\r\nLet me read from the New Chinese/ English\r\n\r\nDictionary,  which  the ISD has proscribed.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse.  I have taken it out of the ISD library.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  civilisation is one of  the  oldest  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Then it says <i>Kai hua, jiao hua, wen ming  shi\r\n\r\njie</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Culture - <i>jiao yang,\r\n\r\nsiu yang, de (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) yu, zai pei, yang zhi, yang\r\n\r\nyu pei yang</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Of course, if\r\n\r\nwe  want  just the old values, then we will be  stuck\r\n\r\nwith <i>zi Ii geng sheng</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Then we start\r\n\r\nlearning  from  the steam engine. If  we  start  from\r\n\r\nStephenson  and the steam engine, by golly,  it  will\r\n\r\ntake a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese and the Manchu Chinese reactions to the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the  West on their ancient  civilisations\r\n\r\nwere completely different, The Chinese Manchu dynasty\r\n\r\nmade the Chinese civilisation pay a very heavy price.\r\n\r\nThey  thought they could shut off the West.  But  the\r\n\r\nJapanese said, \"We'd better get these black ships and\r\n\r\ntheir  cannons quickly.\" Learn. They found out.  They\r\n\r\ngave their daughters in exchange for gunners on board\r\n\r\nships  that  came,  for a sample of  the  guns.  They\r\n\r\nlearned fast. You know the Boxer Rebellion. Why is it\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Boxer Rebellion? It is  still  practised\r\n\r\ntoday.  The  other  day  I was  reading  through  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps magazine. Some instructors  say  nei\r\n\r\ngong(), where you control your inside and  your\r\n\r\nmuscles are so stiff that a car can go over you. Yes.\r\n\r\na  car  with the weight spread. When they sacked  the\r\n\r\nforeign  embassies  in  Peking.  1898, the  European\r\n\r\npowers and the Japanese then sent in an expeditionary\r\n\r\nforce and they thought <i>nei gong</i>(), bullet will\r\n\r\nnot  go through. But they died like flies. They  were\r\n\r\npulverised.  They  were made to pay indemnities.  And\r\n\r\nthey  never  rose  until after  the  war.  They  went\r\n\r\nthrough a whole period of turmoil. All right, so they\r\n\r\nhave with their millions of bare hands paid for the R\r\n\r\nand  D  (Research and Development) with the help,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  of  a  few scientists and technologists  who\r\n\r\nwere trained, and helped in the atomic bomb and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhydrogen bomb research, in America, and they exploded\r\n\r\nthe  first bomb in 1964. Well, they have medium-range\r\n\r\nrockets. Inter-continental missiles, now coming  into\r\n\r\nuse  but  with liquid fuel which is highly  dangerous\r\n\r\nstill.   That   is  what  the  intelligence   reports\r\n\r\npublished in military magazines in NATO tell us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be right, it may be wrong. I do not think we\r\n\r\nwant  to  do  that. We want to try, very  simply,  to\r\n\r\nallow  each  individual ethnic, cultural, linguistic,\r\n\r\nreligious group to keep what it can of its  past  and\r\n\r\nto  acquire  what is necessary to make  Singapore  an\r\n\r\nindustrialised society, or we will never get off  the\r\n\r\nground. If we go back to a farming community with the\r\n\r\nchangkol or the spade, and to fishing. I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  can support a population of 30,000 on three meals\r\n\r\na  day. This is worth a research. Joe, suggest it  to\r\n\r\nsome  of your wiseacres at the University. Say, do  a\r\n\r\nmodel,  simulate  a computer model -  so  much  land,\r\n\r\ninput  so  much  fertiliser, so many  man-hours  with\r\n\r\nchangkol  and  women and children, How many  tons  of\r\n\r\ntapioca can it produce and vegetables and chicken and\r\n\r\ngoats?  You  know what happened to the goats  in  the\r\n\r\nsouthern  islands? Way back in 1959 we put  goats  in\r\n\r\nsouthern islands, Since it is barren, send goats. The\r\n\r\ntheory  was  that  the  goats will  roam  around  the\r\n\r\nislands, feed off all kinds of wild leaves, multiply.\r\n\r\nand the islanders will have a better diet. We paid to\r\n\r\nlearn the hard way. I think that was the first lesson\r\n\r\nin  economics  for me as well as for the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Ubi.  That is not the way  to  develop.  Far\r\n\r\nbetter  we have a petrol refinery than goats,  hoping\r\n\r\nthey  will multiply. Because what happened  was  that\r\n\r\nman's  hunger  was  greater than  goats'  ability  to\r\n\r\nmultiply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on a few other items before I\r\n\r\ncomplete  my,  I  hope, induction  into  both   mass\r\n\r\npolitics  and  parliamentary  politics  for  the  new\r\n\r\nMembers, The way we conduct ourselves in this Chamber\r\n\r\nand outside as MPs, as Parliamentary Secretaries,  as\r\n\r\nMinisters,  will  decide whether in 1981,  beginning,\r\n\r\nmiddle, end, depending on when we think we will  get\r\n\r\nthe maximum votes, the elections are fought from now,\r\n\r\nnot in 1981.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not fight the elections in December, the 23rd.\r\n\r\nWe  fought  it as from September 1972. We  made  sure\r\n\r\nthat  no MP, no Parliamentary Secretary, no Minister,\r\n\r\nmisbehaved or abused his power. Because if you do, it\r\n\r\nis a very tight and swift compact society, it spreads\r\n\r\nlike wild fire. Dr Ong, the Member for Kim Seng,  his\r\n\r\ngeneration  does not go to coffee-shops. But  let  me\r\n\r\ntell  him that he would be surprised to know what  is\r\n\r\nbeing  discussed and debated with very great  candour\r\n\r\nand  vehemence and the very frank language with which\r\n\r\nit  is  discussed, of the weaknesses and  follies  of\r\n\r\nMPs,  Ministers and others. And when the CP mounts  a\r\n\r\nsmear  campaign  I  have  seen  sane  rational   men,\r\n\r\nMinisters,  suddenly  turn pale  because  the  Branch\r\n\r\nSecretary  came and said \"By God, the  whole  kampong\r\n\r\nhas  switched allegiance. Rumour has it  that  you've\r\n\r\ngot four wives.\" The Minister collects a whole bundle\r\n\r\nof  pamphlets,  brings his biography  and  personally\r\n\r\ndistributes it to counter the smear. It took  us  the\r\n\r\nbest  part  of  13 years from 1 952, before  we  even\r\n\r\nfounded the party, to\r\n\r\n1965,  to  establish ourselves as people who  can  be\r\n\r\ntrusted and relied upon regardless of smears. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  could allow a deliberate smear  campaign  of\r\n\r\ncorruption  during the campaign and took action  only\r\n\r\nafter.  We ran the risk that if we took action during\r\n\r\nthe  campaign, they would say \"Unfair\". But after the\r\n\r\ncampaign  -  you utter all these falsehoods,  knowing\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no other way in which to  shake  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  the  people have in the Government, than\r\n\r\nalleging  corruption, well, matters have  got  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved.  We  have to make changes in  the  election\r\n\r\nlaws. Because if a man is bankrupt it is no use suing\r\n\r\nhim. K.C. Lee, how much does he owe you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> $36,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> $36,000. The man returns two\r\n\r\nweeks  before election. Everybody knew that  election\r\n\r\nwas  coming. He returned one month before, dissolves\r\n\r\nhis party, joins the Workers' Party and starts off on\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaign.  The story is not over yet.  Wait  for  the\r\n\r\nnext instalment. There is something quite interesting\r\n\r\ncoming.  Why  did  he  do it? From  now  onwards,  no\r\n\r\nbankrupt  will be allowed to take part in an election\r\n\r\ncampaign. We will change it because the chap says: \"I\r\n\r\nam  bankrupt,  so  what? You sue me.\"  He  owes  K.C.\r\n\r\n$36,000; I now sue him. He owes me $136,000. How much\r\n\r\nmore bankrupt can he be? These are elementary rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me just clear a few of the points which\r\n\r\nnobody  else  will be clearing because  they  overlap\r\n\r\nMinistries.    Mr   Dhanabalan   said    \"legislative\r\n\r\noverkill.\"  That  is  a  fair comment.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nchoice?  Your  choice is to educate  them.  Education\r\n\r\nbegins  in  the home before the child  even  goes  to\r\n\r\nschool. You know what has happened to those who  went\r\n\r\nto  school and never learnt? \"Yes man; no, man.  Buay\r\n\r\nhiau.()\". The Member now knows what  that  means.\r\n\r\nSo  we start off in the schools, but meanwhile people\r\n\r\nare  being  killed on the roads. This is a choice  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  make.  Wait  until  we  have  an  educated,\r\n\r\ncourteous,  considerate generation or start  now  and\r\n\r\nsay \"stop the killing\". Maybe it is wrong. But let us\r\n\r\nsee whether it will work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have talked about fringe car parks for years.\r\n\r\nIt  is not an innovation by Singapore. But nobody had\r\n\r\nthe  restlessness, audacity or courage, depending  on\r\n\r\nwhether  you like us or you do not like us.  We  said\r\n\r\nthat  we cannot allow this as the place will jam  up.\r\n\r\nWith  every  high-rise, just think of the  number  of\r\n\r\nfloors - and each floor of a high-rise building,  you\r\n\r\nmultiply  that by 10 cars. My God, what will  happen?\r\n\r\nSo  we had to do it. We did the fringe car parks. The\r\n\r\nSingaporean then did his calculation. He  is  a  very\r\n\r\nsharp character, He said, \"No. My car in the sun  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole day paying, paint rotting? I'll  take  the\r\n\r\nbus ride from my house.\" So the fringe car parks were\r\n\r\nnot  used.  All  right. We had asked,  I  had  asked,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Cabinet committee  sat  down  with  the\r\n\r\nexperts.  \"What happens if the fringe car  parks  are\r\n\r\nnot used when we have gone to all this trouble?\" They\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Sir,  in that case, we, have got  $7  million\r\n\r\nworth  of  tarmac!\" So we have $7  million  worth  of\r\n\r\ntarmac which we will put to other uses. But if we had\r\n\r\nnot done that, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  wanted  to  commute, we would  have  been  in\r\n\r\nbigger trouble. But it worked, with adjustments, with\r\n\r\nmodifications.  So  it is easy  to  say  \"legislative\r\n\r\noverkill\".  But I ask the Member: is he  prepared  to\r\n\r\nwait  until  we can get the children to  be  literate\r\n\r\nfirst  and  then to bring home the message  to  their\r\n\r\nparents.  Because without language you  cannot  learn\r\n\r\nanything.  If you are deaf and dumb, then  you  start\r\n\r\nmaking  signals  to each other, there  are  very  few\r\n\r\nthings you can communicate by signals of hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is the tool to all human thought, human\r\n\r\nknowledge.  And it is because we made the mistake  of\r\n\r\nallowing   them  to  be  promoted  -  because   their\r\n\r\nmathematics  was  good so they had  the  intelligence\r\n\r\nthat  they  ignored language - that I now see  it  in\r\n\r\nletters that I receive, in Cabinet papers, from first-class  Administrative Officers. And automatically  my\r\n\r\nball-point comes up and I correct, and I say  to  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  Secretary: \"Please show officer who  drafted\r\n\r\nthis.\" I become the school master. It is sad, but  it\r\n\r\nis  true.  If you say, \"Look, you will not  get  into\r\n\r\nJunior College without distinction in your first  and\r\n\r\nsecond   languages.\"  I  tell  you  they   will   get\r\n\r\ndistinctions in their first and second languages. But\r\n\r\nif you say best of five subjects, they will say. \"All\r\n\r\nright.   Which  are  the  ones  that  I  can   score?\r\n\r\nMathematics.    Additional   Mathematics,    Physics,\r\n\r\nChemistry and ECA\", depending on whether you are  the\r\n\r\nvigorous type, like the \"rat-catcher\". But I think it\r\n\r\nis  a  fair point made by Mr Fong Sip Chee,  Mr  Ivan\r\n\r\nBaptist and Encik Sidek Saniff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Sweep and Toto, it is a problem we face. They\r\n\r\nface  it in Moscow. They have got the sweepstake.  If\r\n\r\nyou  do  not run the Big Sweep and Toto, the chap-ji-kee  man who has always swindled the people of  their\r\n\r\nmoney is still there. It is the history of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese  who travelled overseas are the  biggest\r\n\r\ngamblers you can find in the world. Because to  leave\r\n\r\nChina  was to gamble. In Manchu China if you returned\r\n\r\nyou  were  beheaded.  Because you  were  bringing  in\r\n\r\ndangerous  foreign  ideas.  So  to  leave  China  for\r\n\r\nNanyang was a gamble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered once doing a case that the Chinese\r\n\r\ngambled in New Zealand. There was a New Zealand case,\r\n\r\nwhether that came under the New Zealand gaming  laws.\r\n\r\nVery  interesting. Everywhere they went they gambled.\r\n\r\nWhich would you have? An honest Government Toto or  a\r\n\r\ndishonest chap-ji-kee? I spent years getting chap-ji-kee  operators  off.  Ten years,  and  they  paid  me\r\n\r\nhandsomely. And I decided it was wrong. That  is  why\r\n\r\nwe  are changing the laws of evidence and the laws of\r\n\r\nprocedure.   Because  I  knew   it   was   absolutely\r\n\r\nnonsensical. Transferring British ideas of  evidence,\r\n\r\njustice - a man goes to court and swears, \"Yes, I did\r\n\r\nsee  him  stab the other man.<i>\" `M si gua ay tai  chi.\r\n\r\nmai  ch'ap</i>(In Hokkien: not my business.  Don't\r\n\r\nbother.) You have had it. Even in Mandarin,  back  in\r\n\r\nancient   China.   So   we   have   to   make   these\r\n\r\nmodifications.  I say, yes, there is a contradiction.\r\n\r\nAnd  I say, if you stop it they will go and sell  you\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian sweepstakes. We have got Channels 5 and\r\n\r\n8.  You stop the advertisement of cigarette lighters,\r\n\r\nthere are Channels 3 and 10. The reception may not be\r\n\r\nso  good. You block a film in Singapore, you  have  a\r\n\r\nthriving  film  industry in Johore. So  what  is  the\r\n\r\nanswer? The answer really is to implant in the child,\r\n\r\nvery  early, values which will last a life-time.  You\r\n\r\nare  not  going to sell me cigarette smoking, however\r\n\r\nhard  you  try. I hope I have succeeded in implanting\r\n\r\nit  in  three persons I was responsible for  bringing\r\n\r\nout  into this world. Touch wood, none of them smoke.\r\n\r\nBecause  they saw their father smoke, making campaign\r\n\r\nspeeches, trying to keep himself with a packet of  10\r\n\r\nin  his  pocket. In 1957 we fought the  City  Council\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections. At the end of it, at  the  VMH  I\r\n\r\ncould not tell the crowd <i>Kam sia kok wei</i> (). I\r\n\r\nlost  my  voice. That December I said, \"No.  That  is\r\n\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other way. We are an open, exposed\r\n\r\nsociety.  You want to stop the tourists?  It  is  1.5\r\n\r\nmillion.  You want your hotels empty? You  want  your\r\n\r\nshops  to  look  you up? There will be more  tourists\r\n\r\ncoming  to  Singapore than there are Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nanother 10 years or less than 10 years. There  is  no\r\n\r\nother way than to implant the values in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet  us  not kid ourselves. No society is static.  It\r\n\r\neither  adjusts, adapts, learns how to protect itself\r\n\r\nor it is debased, corrupted and brought down. You can\r\n\r\nhave  no  society -mummified, unless it is  isolated,\r\n\r\nlike the Red Indians were, like the Polynesians were.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  the  white men came and  brought  measles,\r\n\r\nchicken  pox,  VD, flu and they die like  flies.  And\r\n\r\nthat  is the way they got rid of a lot of them.  They\r\n\r\ngave  them chicken pox, and the Red Indians died  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  less Red Indians in the world. There  are\r\n\r\nvery few aborigines left in Australia. Or you face up\r\n\r\nto  it.  And  you  face up to it by implanting  basic\r\n\r\nvalues.  That  is why however different  the  various\r\n\r\nreligions, this  Government is in favour  of  a  man\r\n\r\nbelieving  in something than believing in nothing.  I\r\n\r\nwould  rather have a Muslim, a devout Hindu,  than  a\r\n\r\npermissive atheist. And it is because of the problems\r\n\r\nof atheism in the West that they are in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately the Chinese never believed in heaven and\r\n\r\nhell  for  rational  behaviour.  It  is  <i>dao  de  dao\r\n\r\nyi</i>(), that to be a civilised society, as I have\r\n\r\nread just now, \"Man must behave\" says Confucius, long\r\n\r\nbefore  Mao, \"in a certain way in order that  orderly\r\n\r\ncivilised living is possible.\" Not that you  will  go\r\n\r\nto  hell  if you do bad, or you will go to heaven  if\r\n\r\nyou  do  good.  But if you do not do that,  civilised\r\n\r\nliving is not possible for anybody. In the West  they\r\n\r\nsay  \"God  will punish you. Thou shall  not  -\".  The\r\n\r\nBible  says  so. So when they got to the  moon,  they\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Well, this is all not true. It cannot be true.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, there is only one life. And if you miss the\r\n\r\nenjoyment now, you get old, never enjoyed,  you  have\r\n\r\nmissed it. So let's enjoy now.\" As the British  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said, the most hateful slogan he  has  ever\r\n\r\nheard was:\r\n\r\n\"What   do   we   want?\"  And   the   crowd   chants.\r\n\r\n\"Everything\". Just like so-and-so says \"amen.\"  \"What\r\n\r\ndo  we  want? Everything! When do we want  it?  Now!\"\r\n\r\nWhy? Because otherwise you may be dead tomorrow:  you\r\n\r\nwould  have missed the chance. So let us  have  a  go\r\n\r\nquickly  before  we  get  old  and  we  cannot  enjoy\r\n\r\nourselves. Very sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain values which have preserved us.\r\n\r\nThis is much the oldest civilisation in the world,  a\r\n\r\nbit of what you call <i>chui niu, bu da hao</i> ()\r\n\r\n.  It  is  one  of  the great civilisations,  an  old\r\n\r\ncivilisation,    Civilisations   existed    in    the\r\n\r\nMesopotamian  valley, in Mohenjo Daro,  and  lots  of\r\n\r\nother  places.  But it is the only one  which  had  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  history and survived, more or  less  with\r\n\r\ndefinite links to the past. It is different from what\r\n\r\nyou  see of Greece and the people now in Greece.  The\r\n\r\nfirst principle of any civilisation is orderly living\r\n\r\nand  the rearing of the young. Maternity is a  matter\r\n\r\nof  fact,  provable fact. Paternity is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nopinion.  You can have blood tests and so  on.  Maybe\r\n\r\nthey  can  find a test to establish it.  Yes,  it  is\r\n\r\nyours.  Nobody else's. How do you know it is  not  my\r\n\r\nbrother's? And so the Jews accept this fact. And  the\r\n\r\nJews say, \"Never mind what the father was. But is the\r\n\r\nmother  a Jewess? If she is a Jewess, then the  child\r\n\r\nis  a Jew.\" So Sammy Davis is a Jew. That is where he\r\n\r\nhas  got  his talent from. First, you see  his  nose.\r\n\r\nThen  you hear his voice. He got it from his  African\r\n\r\nline, a tremendous big voice. He had the best of both\r\n\r\nworlds.  I  think that is critical. I am not  saying,\r\n\r\n\"No, let us be celibate.\" I am not even asking let us\r\n\r\nall  be  faithful  to  our  wives,  let  us  have  no\r\n\r\ndivorces. I do not ask that. All I ask is, please  do\r\n\r\nnot  misbehave yourself. Anybody who has a  paternity\r\n\r\nsuit  against  him is out and there  will  be  a  by-election.  That  is all I say. Let us  have  none  of\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass media of the West believes that we ought to\r\n\r\nbe  like  them. Why? Because we are human beings  and\r\n\r\nthey are civilised. They are advanced and, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must be like them. We are not like them.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot civilised. But you see, here is my authority.  It\r\n\r\nis the oldest civilisation in the world. It goes back\r\n\r\n5,000  years.  But actually they go  back, provable,\r\n\r\n4,000  years. The 5th thousand is mythology. Whatever\r\n\r\nit  is, that is because, you say, \"Look, you touch my\r\n\r\nwife,  I  kill  you.\" Then there is a pool  in  which\r\n\r\neverybody  can forage. It may be hypocritical.  Maybe\r\n\r\nit  is  bad.  But  it preserved the civilisation  for\r\n\r\n5,000 years and it had nothing to do with God, heaven\r\n\r\nand hell. And I say, you lose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, we lose all. You tell me what we have got, she\r\n\r\nmo  lui  gen ma? <i>Fei lui fei ma</i> ().  Neither\r\n\r\ndonkey  nor horse. You do not know who is the father.\r\n\r\nThat is a very unhappy state of affairs. I am glad P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy shakes his head. Make sure that your son\r\n\r\nis  as devout as you are. I beg your pardon. I think,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, we must change our style because I  read\r\n\r\nfrom Aneurin Bevan it does not become us - we do  not\r\n\r\nspeak  that way. We do not think that way. I use  the\r\n\r\nlanguage,   but  the  inside,  my  value  system   is\r\n\r\ndifferent. I understand the Englishman. He knows deep\r\n\r\nin  his heart that he is superior to the Welshman and\r\n\r\nthe  Scotsman.  That  is why  the  Welshman  and  the\r\n\r\nScotsman  now,  particularly the  Scotsman  with  the\r\n\r\nNorth  Sea  oil, says, \"O.K. I want to be independent\r\n\r\non  my  own.\"  Deep  here, I am a Chinaman.  Yes, an\r\n\r\nuprooted  Chinaman, transformed into  a  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nBecause when I went to China I discovered that I  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  Chinaman. Yes. Mr Lee Khoon Choy will  be  my\r\n\r\nwitness.  I  brought my young daughter  with  me  for\r\n\r\npolitical reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, one of the so-called opposition\r\n\r\nleaders, questioned, \"Who paid for her fare?\"  during\r\n\r\nthe elections. I did. She did not travel at Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for definite specific political reasons, one\r\n\r\nof  them  being to test how a Chinese-educated  girl,\r\n\r\nbut   bilingual,  would  react  to  this   situation.\r\n\r\nCompletely   Chinese  educated,  from   three   years\r\n\r\nkindergarten. Nanyang Nu Zhong you zhi yuan I am glad\r\n\r\nto say that we will relax our regulations about young\r\n\r\npeople  visiting  China. I think  we  were  wrong  Of\r\n\r\ncourse if we let them all go, it grows and grows, all\r\n\r\nthe  chaps  who  join  the  Equatorial  Society,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Musical Association, Kang Le or whatever  it\r\n\r\nis,  and  that  is a, different story. But  in  small\r\n\r\ngroups,  there is no better education  for  a  proper\r\n\r\nappreciation of Singapore. You come back and kiss the\r\n\r\nsoil!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have the rare distinction. You know. I\r\n\r\noften meet great statesmen, my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivilege, who told me wondrous tales before  I  went\r\n\r\nto  China. Of course, a lot of it was true, It  is  a\r\n\r\nmarvellous society compared to what it was. But  when\r\n\r\nwe  were little boys we used to do that sort of thing\r\n\r\n(indicating). <i>\"Ai cho peng yu ma?\"</i> ()  - \"Want  to  be friends?\" Choose which one? <i>\"Ch'ia  seh\r\n\r\nsin   chia  poh.\"</i>()  -  \"This   is\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  Any time, every time, you can  damn  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and so long as it is not a lie and  a\r\n\r\ncriminal lie, nothing happens to you. You can  say  a\r\n\r\nlot of things. You can write books about him, damning\r\n\r\nhim. So long as it is not a libel, go ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you, I have the rare distinction of having\r\n\r\ntwo  Ministerial  colleagues  who  have  brothers  in\r\n\r\nChina.  I have a perception and I think they  have  a\r\n\r\nperception  (they have been there) of China  and  the\r\n\r\ngreat sacrifices they are making to turn China into a\r\n\r\nmodern  industrial state by the end of this  century.\r\n\r\nTo  anybody who wants to go, I say I will give him  a\r\n\r\nfirst-class  trip by SIA with all  the  best  of  in-flight  service. Entry point Hong Kong, if you  like,\r\n\r\ntake  the train: or Tokyo, and take another aircraft.\r\n\r\nSIA  does not yet go to Peking, but one day  we  will\r\n\r\nwhen  we  establish relations. And  I  am  absolutely\r\n\r\ncertain  that,  this can be done, given  appreciation\r\n\r\nthat   we  share  a  common  destiny.  Without   that\r\n\r\nappreciation, of course, we are in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I pose the real basic\r\n\r\nproblem facing Singapore, and indeed the world -  the\r\n\r\nanswer to communism and its spread. Here in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia,  it  is  by  insurgency, subversion,  input  of\r\n\r\nideology, infusion of weapons and insurgency.  If  we\r\n\r\njust  take Singapore alone, we would have solved  the\r\n\r\nproblem,  But  we know that it has not  been  solved,\r\n\r\nbecause it is not just Singapore, They say \"Malaya\" - Malayan Communist Party\r\n\r\n- including Singapore. <i>Bao kuo xinjiapo zai nei</i>().\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the answer? The answer of the West - this\r\n\r\nwas  the  answer of Europe and America of the  Dulles\r\n\r\nera  - was that if you are not anti-communist, it  is\r\n\r\nimmoral. And\r\n\r\nDulles said the Indians were non-aligned and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  they  were  immoral. How do  they  prevent  their\r\n\r\npeople  from going communist? Their counter  ideology\r\n\r\nwas then anti-communism. And in America a witch-hunt.\r\n\r\nthe  McCarthy  era. If you are a communist,  you  are\r\n\r\nout. So if you want to be a naturalised American, you\r\n\r\nswear  that  you  have never been  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunist  party at all, ever in your  life.  But  in\r\n\r\nBritain  - and they used to tell me with great  pride\r\n\r\nand  I listened to them and I almost believed them  - they  said,  \"All  you have got to do  really  is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop. Then you would be like us, where we can have\r\n\r\ncommunists running around and they cannot  cause  any\r\n\r\ntrouble. You see, they have got no followers  because\r\n\r\nwe  give  the  good life to the people. So  they  are\r\n\r\ntreated as cranks, idiots, half-wits.\" Those were the\r\n\r\n1940s  when I was a student. Then came the  1950s\r\n\r\nwhen I was a politician and a member of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment All -Party Delegation. The government then\r\n\r\nwas a very weak one, not independent, and used to  go\r\n\r\nto London every year to negotiate a new constitution.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  met my old friends. They said. \"Yes, that  is\r\n\r\nthe   way.\"   Morgan  Phillips,  now  dead,   general\r\n\r\nsecretary  of the British Labour Party, said,  \"Don't\r\n\r\nworry  at  all.  The Communists are cranks.  Look  at\r\n\r\nthem,  at  every election they lose.\" The  TUC  said,\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no  problem at all. Just a few  cranks.\"  Their\r\n\r\ncounter  was materialism. \"I give you the good  life\"\r\n\r\nwhich means \"With one-man one-vote I seduce you  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  ideology by the good soft  life.\"  Did  it\r\n\r\nwork?  I  do  not think it has worked, The Communists\r\n\r\nhave  now  got into powerful positions in the  unions\r\n\r\nbecause they work harder, To be a communist, you must\r\n\r\nhave very active glands. If you want a good life, you\r\n\r\ngo  into  the city and make money like Slater Walker.\r\n\r\nOr  you  do  it the honest hard way - be a doctor  on\r\n\r\nNational  Health,  or a dentist on  National  Health.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also a good way. Or if you have really  got\r\n\r\nactive  glands, you think the, society is wrong,  you\r\n\r\nare  deprived, you never went through a  good  school\r\n\r\nthat  taught  you  to speak English like  an  English\r\n\r\ngentleman, but you spoke English like a working class\r\n\r\nperson  whose home was poor, then with active  glands\r\n\r\nyou work like a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeaver,   because   your  glands  are   pouring   out\r\n\r\nadrenalin.  So  now  they  are  in  charge  of   very\r\n\r\npowerful, critical unions, and they are setting  the\r\n\r\npace. They are calling the shots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened here in the `40s, `50s and `60s? I\r\n\r\nthink we have very happy memories of the Middle  Road\r\n\r\nunions  - <i>ge ye? eh? fan xing? ge ye, hen huo puo  de</i>\r\n\r\n(). Every day they ate\r\n\r\nthere  and they slept there. They showed the  workers\r\n\r\nhow  hard working they were. They denigrated me. They\r\n\r\nsaid  I had an air-conditioned office and I slept  in\r\n\r\nan  air-conditioned room. I was a bourgeois. So  were\r\n\r\nall  my friends, bourgeois men, They thought we  were\r\n\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learnt how they operated. It is the same modus\r\n\r\noperandi.  They  are active. They  are  working  with\r\n\r\nsocial democrats or democratic socialists. The social\r\n\r\ndemocrat likes his glass of beer, likes to have  fun.\r\n\r\nso  he  leaves the meeting early. When all the  chaps\r\n\r\nhave  left,  they take the vote at 2 o'clock  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning and carry the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the PAP, we used to squat till 3 or 4 o'clock\r\n\r\nam, and in this Parliament. For those who were  then\r\n\r\nnot  here,  we  used to have marathon  sessions  that\r\n\r\nbegan at 2 o'clock p.m. and ended up the next morning\r\n\r\nat  7  o'clock. On one memorable occasion, the failed\r\n\r\ncandidate   for   Rochore  made  a  7 1/2-hour   speech.\r\n\r\nMarvellous.  He  had ghost writers there,  scribbling\r\n\r\naway. As he finished a whole sheaf, more sheaves came\r\n\r\nin.  7 1/2  hours - to intimidate us. They made  a  very\r\n\r\ngrave  error of judgement. He gambled, and  he  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  gambler,  and  he lost.  We  learnt  how  they\r\n\r\noperated.  We knew how the magician worked.  We  were\r\n\r\nnot  in  the audience. We were actually at  the  back\r\n\r\nstage,  watching the magician and, in  fact,  helping\r\n\r\nhim  from  time to time. He said, \"You hold this  hat\r\n\r\nfor me.\" So we held the hat and looked inside and saw\r\n\r\na  hole:  it had a false bottom from where he  pulled\r\n\r\nthe  rabbit.  So  we said. \"Ah, so  that's  it.  Very\r\n\r\nclever.\"  <i>hen cong ming. Ji qiao xiang  dang  Ii  hai</i>\r\n\r\n{) - very clever. The\r\n\r\ntricks are quite skilful, So when it came to our turn\r\n\r\nand they wanted to operate on us, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Ah, yes.\" We were not there when they  pulled\r\n\r\nthe  trigger.  We were somewhere else. And  what  was\r\n\r\nmore  important, we never gave hostages  to  fortune.\r\n\r\nKeep your hands clean, Gentlemen. If we allow you  to\r\n\r\nput  your  hand in anybody's till, then  we  are  all\r\n\r\ndead, politically. That is the first lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it was with great sorrow that we had to\r\n\r\nprosecute Mr Wee Toon Boon. I had no choice.  He  was\r\n\r\nmy  friend. He was my comrade, going back to 1957  in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council elections. He fought the communists\r\n\r\nwith  us. But as Singapore developed, and with  rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment, people got rich quickly. His CCC  member\r\n\r\nwas  a  contractor, building the people all sorts  of\r\n\r\nbuildings. He lent him Mercedes cars. You start  off,\r\n\r\nfirst, by lending the man, \"Any time you like to  use\r\n\r\nmy  car,  it is there. Why sit in a Ford? You  are  a\r\n\r\nMinister.\"  But Ministers use cars only  on  official\r\n\r\nfunctions  from the pool. He said, \"Use my Mercedes.\"\r\n\r\nIt  started  off  that  way. Then  your  appetite  is\r\n\r\nwhetted.  Then  step by step you  are  seduced  until\r\n\r\nfinally,  why not ...? Once you have given a  hostage\r\n\r\nto  fortune,  it  is finished. So please,  Gentlemen,\r\n\r\nlearn  this.  There are many more  lessons  which,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  I will have the pleasure of imparting in time,\r\n\r\nby  which I mean, in time before you are put  to  the\r\n\r\ntest. That is really the crunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other debating points. The Member for\r\n\r\nNee  Soon  said, we rush through Bills in the  House,\r\n\r\nand  so on. We have had an impeccable record. In  the\r\n\r\nThird  Parliament  from 12.10.72 to  24.11.76,  there\r\n\r\nwere  only five Certificates of Urgency. It is a good\r\n\r\ndebating point, that we rushed through the House, all\r\n\r\nthree  Readings, without adequate time for study  and\r\n\r\ndebate. A common occurrence? Five times in 4 1/2  years,\r\n\r\nand  every  one  of  them was very urgent,  technical\r\n\r\nones. Do better next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody else wanted the Parliamentary Pensions Act\r\n\r\nto be amended because, quite rightly, we all feel\r\n\r\nvery sad. I think the Member for Nee Soon also said,\r\n\r\n\".., the Parliamentary Pensions Act (should be\r\n\r\namended) to see whether our late MP is due for any\r\n\r\nentitlement under this Act.\" We all feel and, I feel,\r\n\r\nI have lost a good friend. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  cannot.  We can pass it, but it would  be  wrong.\r\n\r\nBecause the next step is that the civil servant  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Me  too.\"  What is your answer?  What  is  our\r\n\r\nanswer?   Yes,  for  me,  69  heroes  of   Singapore,\r\n\r\ndefenders  of  freedom, but not for you, the  60,000\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, plus the statutory boards,  100,000-plus  people? We have to pay all the widows? The  law\r\n\r\nsays,  and  we  follow the law, that if  a  man  dies\r\n\r\nbefore he has retired, although he has qualified  for\r\n\r\na  pension,  his dependants get one full  year's  pay\r\n\r\nwithout  paying estate duty or income  tax.  That  we\r\n\r\nshall do. And the rest is up to you and me. And I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  say that quite a few have written  to  give\r\n\r\nmore  than I have suggested. I am quite prepared  for\r\n\r\nsome  shocks. Some may write in and say. \"Please  can\r\n\r\nI,  in view of the harsh circumstances I am in,  give\r\n\r\nless  than what you have suggested?\". Well,  that  is\r\n\r\nour  responsibility. We discharge it. And in  1980/81\r\n\r\nwe can face the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other matters - PUB bills, PUB tax surcharge.\r\n\r\nThe    Minister   for   National   Development    and\r\n\r\nCommunications  is  Chairman of  the  PUB  and  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  passes the buck to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nHe  is right. I Interruption! Yes, all right. That is\r\n\r\nfair. Mr Lim Kim San, his shoulders are broad enough.\r\n\r\nHe  will take anything. He does not run from a scrap.\r\n\r\nI say yes, an adjustment will have to be made. We all\r\n\r\nknow  that  this was a campaign issue,  and  probably\r\n\r\ncost  us some votes. All right, the price of  oil  is\r\n\r\ngoing   up,   and  adjustments  have  to   be   made.\r\n\r\nElectricity bills will have to go up because the cost\r\n\r\nof  oil  has gone up. We will adjust it so  that  all\r\n\r\nthose who live right up to the point-block flats will\r\n\r\nbe  out of the tax range. We are working it out. That\r\n\r\nis for electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for water, it is a different problem. In the case\r\n\r\nof water, it is not money that we want. We want to\r\n\r\ninculcate thrift in the use of water. It becomes a\r\n\r\nhabit. We get a drought that lasts like the one in\r\n\r\n1963 when we went to elections - it lasted six to\r\n\r\nseven months - and we were in deep trouble. Then 80%\r\n\r\nof Singapore were living in houses without the water-closet. And we were having to switch off the water\r\n\r\nmains without causing trouble. But now if you switch\r\n\r\noff the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater  mains,  and  we  are all on  the  water-closet\r\n\r\nsystem,  I  ask  you, \"What will you  do?\"  We  tried\r\n\r\nindustrial  water when Mr Ngeow Pack Hua, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Boon Lay went canvassing, there were complaints.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Metal parts rust and corrode because industrial\r\n\r\nwater  has  a  high content of salt.  <i>dui  bu  dui</i>(Is it not right?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the Singaporean. He is a hardworking,\r\n\r\nindustrious, rugged individual, Or we would not  have\r\n\r\nmade the grade. But let us also recognise that he  is\r\n\r\nchampion  grumbler.  That is  why  you  see  all  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  sociologists go round the  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats  asking.  \"Do you like the government?  Do  you\r\n\r\nlike  to  live  here?\" Of course, they pour  out  all\r\n\r\ntheir  woes and all their grouses. Sure win  for  the\r\n\r\nopposition.  Well, the Barisan Sosialis contested  in\r\n\r\nfive constituencies. They had all their candidates in\r\n\r\nfive  constituencies like Toa Payoh to test,  because\r\n\r\nthey  know  that  is  the new  Singapore.  The  attap\r\n\r\nkampong  will  be  over.  No  place  to  hide   guns,\r\n\r\ngrenades.   And   every  block  will  have   national\r\n\r\nservicemen, police, army, vigilante corps  and  Block\r\n\r\ncommittees, loyal to the people of Singapore.  Never\r\n\r\nmind whether they vote opposition or vote PAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the price of water is not graded in blocks,\r\n\r\nand people start using water lavishly then when there\r\n\r\nis  a  drought, Gentlemen, you tell me how do you  go\r\n\r\nand  get  a  bucket  of water - Affluent  water  (not\r\n\r\n\"effluent\" spelt with an `e' but \"affluent\"  with  an\r\n\r\n`a')  -  there is a ban. We speak Singapore  English.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  water our gardens, we do not  use  effluent\r\n\r\nwater  but affluent water. When I read this,  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"God  bless my soul\". Only in Singapore,  see!  If  I\r\n\r\nwere  a newspaper man, I could write quite an article\r\n\r\nabout Singapore: what an affluent society, even their\r\n\r\nwater,  in  times of drought! The flowers and  shrubs\r\n\r\nare  kept  alive with affluent water! This  and  many\r\n\r\nother things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want the income tax reliefs to be increased. Why\r\n\r\nnot? But let me tell you the impact. The argument  is\r\n\r\nsound:  yes, it was fixed 30 years ago. Yes, I  think\r\n\r\nthe Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson made the point. <i>shi bu shi</i>? (Isn't\r\n\r\nit?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> <i>Shi</i> (Yes).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right. The cost of living\r\n\r\n30  years  ago,  <i>er shi, san shi nien  qien</i>  ( -  \r\n\r\ntwenty, thirty years ago). I  have  got  the\r\n\r\nfigures which show how much the base will shrink  by.\r\n\r\nYou have got to cut for everybody. So the chap at the\r\n\r\ntop  immediately gets the benefit, and  all  the  way\r\n\r\ndown.  And  I  think the broader the  base  the  more\r\n\r\npeople pay income tax, the less they are in favour of\r\n\r\nthings  for  free.  I  am anticipating  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance's speech on the 4th of March. I have just had\r\n\r\nto  read  it.  41% of revenue is going to  come  from\r\n\r\nincome  tax.  You want to cut it down to  35%?  Fine.\r\n\r\nWhere  do  we find the 6%? Any suggestions?  And  you\r\n\r\nknow  that  is the most unfair tax. Why do they  look\r\n\r\nfor   MPs, those  people  wanting  hawker  licences?\r\n\r\nBecause you can make $3,000 a month if you are a good\r\n\r\nkuay  teow  man  and no income tax. Is  it  not?  Car\r\n\r\nparks, nobody pays income tax. So we have got to look\r\n\r\naround and see, \"Ah, he has got a Mercedes Benz and a\r\n\r\nhouse.\" Then we catch him. But he is clever. He  puts\r\n\r\nit in his cousin's name, and so on, so that we do not\r\n\r\nget him. You want to impose an unfair tax on the wage\r\n\r\nearner  who cannot dodge the tax? But the Singaporean\r\n\r\nis  a champion tax dodger. He is a champion grumbler.\r\n\r\nHe  is  a champion tax dodger. Hawking is one.  There\r\n\r\nare  many others. I hate to say this, but I think the\r\n\r\nmedical  profession is a very lucrative one,  present\r\n\r\nMembers  excepting. Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  when you go and see a private doctor,  he  will\r\n\r\ngive  you  a  jab for anything between  $5  and  $10.\r\n\r\ndepending on whether he adds vitamins or no vitamins,\r\n\r\nand you do not get a receipt for it. Boh su yiau, lah\r\n\r\n(  - no need, la). So you are taxing the  honest\r\n\r\nand making the dishonest wealthier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real tax policy for us as a developing country\r\n\r\nis  a tax on expenditure. Yes, value added, which  is\r\n\r\nthe way the European Community does it. Their biggest\r\n\r\ntax comes from value added tax. The more you spend,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  more  money you have, the better  the  life  you\r\n\r\nlead,  the  more  you can afford  to  pay  for  other\r\n\r\npeople's children's education, good health. But here,\r\n\r\nthe  higher the income tax, by cutting the  base  you\r\n\r\nput  the burden on a small group, the more unjust  it\r\n\r\nbecomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson is a wage earner. I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with him, So am I, cannot  dodge  it.  He\r\n\r\ncannot.  But  if I am a contractor I can  build  your\r\n\r\nhouse. We are friends, so I will build your house.  I\r\n\r\nwill  charge you one-tenth the price, or maybe  free.\r\n\r\nYou  sell  me the fridge cheap, and maybe furnish  my\r\n\r\nhouse for me, since you make furniture, So Income Tax\r\n\r\nhas  a  transaction in which no money was passed.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that. I practised the law for 10 years  and  my\r\n\r\njob  - I am sorry to say - involved getting dishonest\r\n\r\npeople to avoid paying their taxes. And often (I  say\r\n\r\nthis  without  wanting  to be immodest)  successfully\r\n\r\nbecause the Government lawyer, on a fixed salary,  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  good as the private lawyer with a very  high\r\n\r\nincentive.  If  a man has got to pay half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  in tax, he is prepared to give me  at  least\r\n\r\n10% if I get him off. If I take less than 10%, I am a\r\n\r\nfool,  am  I  not? Can the Government  also  pay  its\r\n\r\nlawyers  10%  on  the  1/2-million  dollars?   So   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is always landed with the less sharp legal\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not that we pass too many Bills. It\r\n\r\nis  that  there are no good draftsmen, and it worries\r\n\r\nme  because laws have to be passed. I do not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  my own lawyer, but when I flip through it, I know\r\n\r\nthat  certain  basic  draftsmanship  laws  are  being\r\n\r\nbreached. But who is to do it? Nobody who has four As\r\n\r\nin the HSC takes law. There is engineering, medicine,\r\n\r\nyou  name it. But law, what for? You are playing with\r\n\r\nwords.  So  we  know  from the point  of  entry,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Entrance, just what the level of  ability\r\n\r\nis. And at. 18-plus, if that is your level, you might\r\n\r\nwork  hard and improve. But it is very unlikely  that\r\n\r\nyou will have that sharp razor edge. So that is a big\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will sort out all the other problems. But one\r\n\r\nmajor  and  decisive problem is how  do  we  produce,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  crunch comes, a group of  men  who  will\r\n\r\nsurvive the crunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  last  time,  in  1959, very fortunately, if  my\r\n\r\nmemory  is right, we won 43 out of 51 seats. In  1961\r\n\r\nwhen  the crunch came and they thought the other side\r\n\r\nwas  winning,  it  became  26-25.  It  was  quite  an\r\n\r\nexperience, and  of  course the British  were  quite\r\n\r\nworried too. So they said, \"Look, keep the communists\r\n\r\nout at all costs. Have an alliance with - never mind,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are corrupt or not - the Labour  Front.\r\n\r\nSocialists, whatever it was. Have an  alliance  with\r\n\r\nthem.\"  If  we had, we would have died. Finally, one\r\n\r\ndied  -  Ahmad Ibrahim. Another good man. He died  in\r\n\r\n1962. It became 25-25.  If  Singapore  wants excitement,  that  is  real\r\n\r\nexcitement.  That is real drama and a  real  test  of\r\n\r\nnerves. And we had to bring in a sick Member here  to\r\n\r\nvote at all odd hours of the day and night. From mid-1962, when Ahmad Ibrahim died, till September 1  963,\r\n\r\nover  one year, it was a test of nerves. So  we  knew\r\n\r\nwhat  the  melting  point  was, at  what  degree  of\r\n\r\ntemperature. It was a process of elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Gentlemen of that generation, there are\r\n\r\nonly  ten left in this House. Of the 1955 generation.\r\n\r\nwhen  I was sitting in the Opposition debating  with,\r\n\r\nfirst,  Mr David Marshall, and then Mr Lim Yew  Hock,\r\n\r\nthere   were  four  of  us  -  three  PAP   and   one\r\n\r\nIndependent. Ahmad Ibrahim is dead. Goh Chew Chua  is\r\n\r\ndead.  Lim  Chin Siong is in Britain, I  hope  living\r\n\r\ncomfortably  and  happily. He  also  made  the  wrong\r\n\r\nchoice, but at least he was courageous enough to say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, I call it quits.\" And I respect him. I am  the\r\n\r\nsole survivor of the 1955 generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nine others from 1959. Harrowing days they\r\n\r\nwere! Let me read their names. I go back to 1955.  Mr\r\n\r\nChan  Chee Seng (Jalan Besar) 1959. Mr Chor Yeok  Eng\r\n\r\n(Bukit Timah) 1959. He will bear witness that Barisan\r\n\r\nwent  to look for him in the middle of the night.  He\r\n\r\nlived in Bukit Timah in a lonely place, and they were\r\n\r\ngoing  to fix him. If he crossed over, then it  would\r\n\r\nbecome  25-26. If I had to go to battle and I had  to\r\n\r\nchoose  one  other,  I will pick him.[Applause.]  Goh\r\n\r\nKeng  Swee,  Lee  Khoon  Choy,  Ong  Pang  Boon,   S.\r\n\r\nRajaratnam, Toh Chin Chye, Haji Ya'acob and Yong Nyuk\r\n\r\nLin. I am not a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslim.  I  do  not know where Haji Ya'acob  got  his\r\n\r\nstrength  from, maybe from Islam. But if I  am  in  a\r\n\r\ntight  corner  I  think I would  like  to  have  Haji\r\n\r\nYa'acob  around because together we had gone  through\r\n\r\nsome  very tough times. [Applause] The real test  was\r\n\r\nwhen there were race clashes and the police were  not\r\n\r\nin  our  hands from 1963 to 1965. It was so easy  for\r\n\r\nthe  Malays just to flip over and fix Ya'acob. He was\r\n\r\noffered a vast sum of money. Berapa ban yak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed):</b> Ten years' salary and\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ten years' salary and allowances\r\n\r\njust  to  switch over.

The communists were running\r\n\r\naround.  Rahim Ishak, E. W. Barker, Fong Sip Chee,  P.\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy - may I pause here? Congratulations!  He\r\n\r\nmade  Mr  David Marshall lose his deposit  in  Anson.\r\n\r\n[Applause.]  When  the  communists  backed  Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall in the by-election in 1962, Mr Marshall won.\r\n\r\nWhen  the communists fielded their own candidate,  Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall lost his deposit. You beat Barisan, We  want\r\n\r\nto  make sure that we have got men like him. Ho Cheng\r\n\r\nChoon,  Ho  See  Beng, Jek Yeun  Thong,  who  was  my\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary in 1959. I am glad that  I  lost\r\n\r\nonly my Parliamentary Secretary, and not my Political\r\n\r\nSecretary.  My Parliamentary Secretary, whom  Mr  Jek\r\n\r\nhad  guaranteed  had  given  up  communism, suddenly\r\n\r\nwalked  over to the other side. I woke up one morning\r\n\r\nto  find he was anti-Malaysia, anti-Merger. You know.\r\n\r\nthis  was  a  very deep conspiracy. Jek  (I  give  no\r\n\r\nsecrets away) was the leader of the cell under  which\r\n\r\nChan  Sun  Wing, my former Parliamentary  Secretary.\r\n\r\nwas.  But  Jek did not know that his former  superior\r\n\r\nturned up and told Chan Sun Wing to switch. So  Jek's\r\n\r\norder was countermanded. Chan Sun Wing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought  that  the other side was going  to  win,  so\r\n\r\nbetter  take the other side's orders. God bless  Chan\r\n\r\nSun  Wing.  I hope, if he is alive somewhere  in  the\r\n\r\nRhio  Islands or in Indonesia or some place, that  he\r\n\r\nis  living peacefully and happily because if he comes\r\n\r\nback  the  police  would  like  to  ask  him  a   few\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963 - Lim Kim San. Ng Kah Ting (Punggol), my\r\n\r\ncongratulations. We did not expect to win. The Member\r\n\r\nwas  then 23, a very young man. He probably also  did\r\n\r\nnot  expect to win, but fought and won. Ng Yeow Chong\r\n\r\n- I am sorry to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has not been\r\n\r\nable  yet  to  attend  our  Sittings  because  he  is\r\n\r\nreceiving  treatment in hospital for his eye.  Othman\r\n\r\nWok  and  Rahmat Kenap. I pause there and say  -  <i>Ta'\r\n\r\nnampak  songkok awak</i>. It is hidden by the microphone.\r\n\r\nYes, he has not got a Ph.D. He has not even got a BA.\r\n\r\nI  go further here. Ada School Certificate? Ada Sijil\r\n\r\n\"O\" level?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai):</b> <i>Ta`ada</i>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> <i>Ta'ada</i>. But I tell you what he\r\n\r\nhas  got:  courage, loyalty and steadfastness  in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis. After the riots in Geylang Serai, it was like\r\n\r\nthat,  each time I went down to face the mob. It  was\r\n\r\neasier for me but tougher for him because he was then\r\n\r\ntreated  as  a traitor, kafir. In fact, in  the  last\r\n\r\nelections he was nearly called a kafir. For those who\r\n\r\nare  not  familiar with this word or phrase, that  is\r\n\r\nthe worst thing you can call a Muslim - an infidel He\r\n\r\nis  a  good  Haji.  This time he survived  the  smear\r\n\r\nbecause he had learned, without a School Certificate,\r\n\r\nwhat is required of an MP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sia Kah Hui, Teong Eng Siong - 1963 generation: 24\r\n\r\nout  of 69 - just one over one-third. If we can  pass\r\n\r\nto  you, the other two-thirds, an idea of what it was\r\n\r\nlike,  then  maybe we will be all  right.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that you (the two-thirds) are not all  right.\r\n\r\nAll I am saying is that: you would not know until the\r\n\r\nguns  open  fire. You can put soldiers through,  what\r\n\r\nthey  call, the fireworks -where they know that  they\r\n\r\nare  firing blanks and thunder flashes, and there  is\r\n\r\nso much smoke and so on. But when an army goes in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the  American army landing in North  Africa  in\r\n\r\n1943 for the first time, they got really slaughtered.\r\n\r\nIt was only after that first shock that they got over\r\n\r\nthe  combat  shock,  and  became  warriors.  You  can\r\n\r\nsimulate it but it is not the same. When he knows  it\r\n\r\nis  a  real live bullet, because it goes zing and  is\r\n\r\nmeant  for  him, that is the time when you know  -you\r\n\r\nlook at his pants and you know whether he is a man or\r\n\r\nhe is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the 1966 generation - the by-elections\r\n\r\nwhen  Barisan Sosialis walked out. Ho Kah Leong,  Lim\r\n\r\nGuan  Hoo.  He went to fight Bukit Merah,  which  was\r\n\r\nfirst won by Barisan. Well, he won. But we shall miss\r\n\r\nhim.  I hope he can recover but the chances are  very\r\n\r\nslender,  and  his  wife  and  family  are  facing  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  ordeal. Mr Tang See Chim,  Dr  Yeoh  Ghim\r\n\r\nSeng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the 1967 generation. Mr Ang Nam Piau, Mr P.\r\n\r\nSelvadurai. I think the 1967 generation is not  quite\r\n\r\nthe  same, because then they knew they were  winners.\r\n\r\nIn  1966, maybe we could still have lost But in  1963\r\n\r\nwhen  we  fought we knew that we could not only  lose\r\n\r\nour pants, but we could lose our lives. And those who\r\n\r\nwere  at  the counting centres at Bukit Timah, where\r\n\r\nthey  lost -Mr K.C. Lee for Bukit Panjang and Mr Chor\r\n\r\nYeok Eng for Bukit Timah - if we had lost and Barisan\r\n\r\nhad  won.  I  think they would have come out  of  the\r\n\r\ncounting  centre  pretty bashed up. Oompah!  Merdeka!\r\n\r\nOompah! Merdeka! and the crowds were there They  have\r\n\r\nthe technique, and I admire this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, in 1957 when I was at the Vatican, St.\r\n\r\nPeter's, the first time the Pope was being televised,\r\n\r\nas  he came out from the aisle, my God. I watched it.\r\n\r\nHaving  watched the communists. I know  some  of  the\r\n\r\nmodus  operandi  of this, the mass reaction.  As  the\r\n\r\nPope  came down carried on this palanquin, the  crowd\r\n\r\nlifted  their arms and said, \"Viva il Papa,  Viva  il\r\n\r\nPapa.\" I said. \"Boy, this is strange.\" I hope this is\r\n\r\nnot  blasphemy.  I  have got seven  Catholic  Members\r\n\r\nhere.  I  am  on their side. I said. \"Where  are  the\r\n\r\ncheer leaders?\" I looked around and there, up on  the\r\n\r\nwalls,  the  pillars, were choir boys.  As  the  Pope\r\n\r\npassed the choir boys said, \"Viva il\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450.</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPapa, Viva il Papa\" and the nuns below said \"Viva il\r\n\r\nPapa\"  and the crowd went \"Viva il Papa\". Two thousand\r\n\r\nyears of sound, tried and tested techniques, and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, we know a lot more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see when one opposition leader went to\r\n\r\nFullerton  Square and said, \"We want to be heard\".  I\r\n\r\nsaid  it  is kindergarten stuff. If we had wanted  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the opposition we would have  carried  on\r\n\r\nwith our Party conference on 12th December. Let us be\r\n\r\nfrank, we called off our Party conference slated  for\r\n\r\nDecember the 12th. 13th was Nomination day. We  said,\r\n\r\n\"No.  We  would  intimidate the opposition.  That  is\r\n\r\nbad.\"  We  could  have packed that meeting.  We  were\r\n\r\ngoing to win, We had the organisation. We could  have\r\n\r\nscared  the opposition. They did not have to  believe\r\n\r\nme. We knew that the Western press wanted them to win\r\n\r\nand  would say, \"Well, the PAP demonstrated. They had\r\n\r\na  huge  crowd  of 50,000 and intimidated  them.\"  We\r\n\r\nsaid, \"No, cancel it.\" We won. We won because we gave\r\n\r\nno hostages to fortune. We governed fairly, honestly,\r\n\r\nand justly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one last word of advice, if you like to call\r\n\r\nit, or just plain fact. If you want to be popular, do\r\n\r\nnot   try   to  be  popular  all  the  time.  Popular\r\n\r\ngovernment  does not mean that you do popular  things\r\n\r\nall the time. We do not want to be unpopular or to do\r\n\r\nunpopular  things. But when they are necessary, they\r\n\r\nwill be done. Popular representative government means\r\n\r\nthat within each five-year period, your policies have\r\n\r\ndemonstrably worked and won popular support  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat it means And if we flinch from the unpopular, we\r\n\r\nare  in  deep trouble. Of course, the Area  Licensing\r\n\r\nScheme  was  unpopular.  Of course, car  taxes  were\r\n\r\nunpopular.  But. Gentlemen, which would you  have?  A\r\n\r\njammed-up Singapore with car owners exasperated, bus\r\n\r\npassengers  exasperated,  or  20,000  to  30,000  car\r\n\r\nowners  having to lay up their cars and  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands  going through in buses or in shared  cars?\r\n\r\nWe  made  that decision, and it was right. Of course.\r\n\r\nif we had an election period, like the New Zealanders\r\n\r\nand the Australians have, for three years instead  of\r\n\r\nfive years, that is more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult. But Sir Robert Menzies, in spite of three-year  periods, won and stayed in office for 12 years.\r\n\r\nBut  he  knew that popular representative  government\r\n\r\nmeans  that sometimes even when 51% (he once told  me\r\n\r\nup  till  55%)  are  against you,  if  it  is  right,\r\n\r\nproceed. When it works out all right, they will swing\r\n\r\nback.  But if you flinch, then that 55% becomes  65%,\r\n\r\nand you are out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave you with a final rider. This is psephology.\r\n\r\nAll of you are pressing to do popular things and, of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is right - more and better homes, more  and\r\n\r\nbetter  amenities. But let me pose you  this  problem\r\n\r\nand  you think it out. I am not going to give you the\r\n\r\nanswer.  I  am not going to tell anybody the  answer.\r\n\r\nTake  two similar constituencies, both Housing  Board\r\n\r\nestates. One is Marine Parade and the other is  Buona\r\n\r\nVista.  I  have got the figures here.  Both  are  new\r\n\r\nconstituencies. Marine Parade has no one-room  flats.\r\n\r\nBuona Vista - I think Dr Ang Kok Peng can tell  us  - has  got  1,300  one-room flats. (I am speaking  from\r\n\r\nmemory.  My  papers are in a jumble but I  will  find\r\n\r\nthem.)  The Member for Buona Vista won 80.65% of  the\r\n\r\nvotes. The Member for Marine Parade, with the mostest\r\n\r\nfive-room  flats,  with the mostest four-room  flats.\r\n\r\nwith   no  one-room  flats,  got  76%.  Right?   Now.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you are to succeed us. At least I hope you\r\n\r\ndo,  otherwise you should not be here.  Tell  me  the\r\n\r\nanswer.   Both   were   new  MPs.   Both   were   new\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Is it because Dr Ang  Kok  Peng  was\r\n\r\nbetter known after being in Crawford?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Next to Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, next to Ulu Pandan. Part of\r\n\r\nUlu  Pandan. Is it because the Member for Ulu  Pandan\r\n\r\nlooked after it better than the Member for Joo Chiat?\r\n\r\nBoth  faced candidates who were unknown. Can somebody\r\n\r\nsolve  it?  The team who can sit down and solve  that\r\n\r\nriddle  has got one of the qualifications to  succeed\r\n\r\nus Only one of the qualifications - solve it. I think\r\n\r\nI  know, and I will tell only a few people. I do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in telling university researchers where  they\r\n\r\ngo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrong.  They  write  all  kinds  of  spurious   silly\r\n\r\narticles or books. They get MA's and Ph.D's for them.\r\n\r\nI  read  them  and I know them to be wrong.  I  laugh\r\n\r\naway.  But  I  never tell them why  they  are  wrong.\r\n\r\nBecause I am an Asian. I am not a Westerner. This  is\r\n\r\nan  Asian  situation, and do not be clever. Why  show\r\n\r\nthem  how clever we are. Be modest. Just keep  quiet.\r\n\r\nIf  they  want to be wrong headed, wish them luck.  I\r\n\r\nmust  apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir, because  my  papers\r\n\r\nmust have got stuck. But I promise to get the figures\r\n\r\npublished. The facts are there. I am publishing known\r\n\r\nfacts.  `How  many five-room point-blocks?  How  many\r\n\r\nfour-room  blocks?  How many one-room, two-room  and\r\n\r\nthree-room  blocks? And on all counts, and  at  every\r\n\r\nstage,  the  Member for Marine Parade had the  better\r\n\r\nconstituency.  By the seaside, you  get  sea  breeze.\r\n\r\nWhat'  more can you ask for? Higher income. Those  of\r\n\r\nyou who do not get from the Minister for Finance your\r\n\r\nswimming pool or your sports stadium, take heart.  Do\r\n\r\nnot  worry.  That is not the magic. The  magic  is  a\r\n\r\ncombination of factors which go more than just beyond\r\n\r\nincome and creature comforts and a good home.  But  I\r\n\r\nwill  lay my bottom dollar - I am not a betting  man,\r\n\r\nas  a rule. I never buy the Toto. I never buy the Big\r\n\r\nSweep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because the first lesson I\r\n\r\nlearnt in mathematics was the law of chances.  If  we\r\n\r\neach  buy one ticket, one in 10 gets a chance to  win\r\n\r\n$10.  But  if we each buy, one ticket and the  winner\r\n\r\ngets  $7.  I  say,  \"No. Count me out.\"  Because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes 30% as tax. Why should I buy? It  is\r\n\r\nsilly.  But there are silly people. So we  cater  for\r\n\r\nthem.  But I will bet one bottom dollar that  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  elections  in  1980/81, the Member  for  Marine\r\n\r\nParade,  given  six to eight per cent growth  between\r\n\r\nnow  and  1980/81, will improve his margin. Not  only\r\n\r\nbecause he will get a playing field after the  school\r\n\r\nis  built, but because he would have learnt  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  formula.  And, Gentlemen, when Western  educated\r\n\r\nacademics  want  to  visit your  constituencies,  say\r\n\r\n\"Please by all means\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  if you ask my opinion, my advice to you is, let\r\n\r\nthem  find  out  the  old formula,  which  they  will\r\n\r\ndiscover  long after we have gone on to new formulae.\r\n\r\nThat away, you will live long, happily in office, and\r\n\r\nin  retirement, with a government ticking  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  you  enjoy your pension.
