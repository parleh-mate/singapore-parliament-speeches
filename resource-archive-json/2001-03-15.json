This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  persons below the age of 21 are deemed not  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  legal  capacity  to  enter into  any  contract  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of a flat.

Every parent with a child in our school  system\r\n\r\nhas  suggestions on how to improve it.  Some of  these  ideas\r\n\r\nsound very logical and it is tempting to tweak the system  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  them.   For instance, when  pupil  workload  was\r\n\r\nidentified to be an issue, we reduced the course load.   Sir,\r\n\r\nI surmise that step-wise improvements are useful, provided we\r\n\r\nare  already  very  happy  with  our  existing  system.   But\r\n\r\nsometimes  it  might be better if we perform a  total  review\r\n\r\nand, where necessary, implement system-wide changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we have got today is a very good system,\r\n\r\nhighly  productive and efficient.  All we have to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nlook  at the recent 'A' and 'O' level results, and from  that\r\n\r\nperspective,  it is a system any education authority  in  the\r\n\r\nworld would envy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a system designed by systems engineers where\r\n\r\npupils  are  sorted  according to their  learning  abilities.\r\n\r\nFrom  primary 4 onwards, the school children are graded every\r\n\r\ntwo  years, and streamed to different ability streams.  After\r\n\r\n'O'  level,  they are channelled into different career  paths\r\n\r\naccording to their examination results.  Some 20%  go  on  to\r\n\r\nuniversities, another 40% to the polytechnics and the rest to\r\n\r\nITE.   It  is  a  traditional system where rote learning  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  pay great dividends.  As a result,  we  send  our\r\n\r\nchildren to schools to be educated.  They ended up being on a\r\n\r\ntreadmill whose speed is being cranked up one notch every  so\r\n\r\noften,  because  there is a need to separate the  outstanding\r\n\r\nfrom the merely good.  Stress is high.  And our children  end\r\n\r\nup spending most of their time poring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover books and pitifully little time in other activities such\r\n\r\nas  sports that school-going children in other countries  are\r\n\r\nengaged  in.  Many of our children do not enjoy school,  even\r\n\r\nthough they score very well in their examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is worthwhile for us to note that almost\r\n\r\nevery  education  system  in the  world  requires  a  12-year\r\n\r\neducation for the children before they are admitted into  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.   This  minimum period seems to  be  a  universal\r\n\r\nnorm.   Perhaps  it  has something to do  with  the  maturing\r\n\r\nprocess  of the human mind.  However, because of our singular\r\n\r\nfocus  on knowledge acquisition, at every level of our school\r\n\r\nsystem, our children out-perform their counterparts in  other\r\n\r\ncountries, in particular, some of the western countries.  But\r\n\r\nonce  our  young  men  and  women  graduated  from  a  4-year\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree programme, I surmise that they  emerge  no\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the graduates from other overseas universities.\r\n\r\nSo,  the advantage gained in our school system seems, to  me,\r\n\r\nto  be  short-term ones.  Therefore, my question is:   is  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  subject  our children to  study  so  much,  be\r\n\r\nsubject to so much stress prior to entering university  when,\r\n\r\nafter  graduation, they are almost back to the same level  as\r\n\r\nothers from a less stressful education system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I think it is well-known in the university\r\n\r\neducation  circle  that no matter how we design  the  sorting\r\n\r\nsystem,  be  it examinations or otherwise, it is very  likely\r\n\r\nthat  the same strong students will always emerge at the top.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  that  is the case, and if we do not have  permanent\r\n\r\nlong-term advantages, the question then is: why do we put our\r\n\r\nchildren  through a pressure cooker system, so much  so  that\r\n\r\none young girl even took her own life for failing to meet  up\r\n\r\nto  her own expectations?  I note that Dr Lily Neo has a  cut\r\n\r\non this subject and I would not go into this further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years now, the Government has asserted that the\r\n\r\nstress  in  the education system is not there as a result  of\r\n\r\nany  Government policy.  The Minister has, in fact, responded\r\n\r\non  many occasions that even if he instructed the schools  to\r\n\r\nban all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhomework,  it  would not have changed the situation  at  all.\r\n\r\nThe  simple  reason is that the parents would then  step  in,\r\n\r\ntake  over and hire tutors to ensure that their children stay\r\n\r\non  top.   So,  who  is responsible for  the  stress  in  our\r\n\r\neducation system  -  the parents or the system itself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents' behaviours are indeed rational and\r\n\r\nlogical.   They want the best for their children.   They  are\r\n\r\nequipping their children for the best jobs in the job market.\r\n\r\nI surmise that they are just responding to the way our system\r\n\r\nselects  candidates to fill the best jobs in the job  market,\r\n\r\nin  particular, when they first graduate from the university.\r\n\r\nAt  that  stage, because of our transparency and our emphasis\r\n\r\non  meritocracy, individuals are chosen by the civil service,\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs  and  statutory boards based almost exclusively  on\r\n\r\ntheir academic achievements.  Furthermore, because we have  a\r\n\r\nscholarship  system, these candidates are chosen  soon  after\r\n\r\ntheir  'A' level examination results, when most of  them  are\r\n\r\njust 18 years old.  For the creme de la creme, good jobs  and\r\n\r\nwell-smoothened  career  paths  await  the  scholastic   high\r\n\r\nachievers.  This is epitomised by the public  service,  which\r\n\r\nonly picks the very best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no easier way to pick them than to\r\n\r\nbase  on scholastic achievement at that time.  I believe this\r\n\r\nis  what  drives  the  competitive engine  in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem.  Examinations must be designed to separate the few at\r\n\r\nthe  apex  from the mere outstanding.  At the last 'A'  level\r\n\r\nresults, the number of students with 4 As, if you look at the\r\n\r\nreport,  is in fact very staggering.  Since we can no  longer\r\n\r\nseparate  the cream from the mere outstanding, we  introduced\r\n\r\nthe  S  paper into the examinations.  This intensity  to  get\r\n\r\nbetter and better results in the examinations percolates down\r\n\r\nthe  whole system, from pre-university all the way to primary\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we were to address how to improve our\r\n\r\napproach  to education, reducing course load to the  students\r\n\r\nitself  is  not  enough.  We will still need  to  change  the\r\n\r\nculture, starting with changing the selection process for the\r\n\r\nbest jobs in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njob  market.  In this area, the Government will have to  take\r\n\r\nthe  lead if we are indeed committed to changing the culture.\r\n\r\nTo  start with, we should change the way candidates  for  the\r\n\r\nbest  jobs in the civil service are selected.  We should  de-emphasise  scholastic achievements and focus on  demonstrated\r\n\r\nabilities.   Perhaps  we can learn from the  Singapore  Armed\r\n\r\nForces  how  they  select  the  officers,  where  the   total\r\n\r\ncapability of the individual is assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is for the Administrative Service to\r\n\r\nrely  less on scholars, fresh out of the university,  and  to\r\n\r\ntap matured talents from the open job market.  If the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs and the statutory boards take the cue, we could  be\r\n\r\non  our way to change the culture.  Once that message is made\r\n\r\nloud  and  clear, I am sure the behaviour of the parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents will change accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, changing the culture of the whole society is\r\n\r\nnot  the  task  of  MOE  alone, but might  require  a  policy\r\n\r\ndecision  by  the Cabinet.  But change we must in  order  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  continue  to do well  in  the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   Creativity and innovation are key  to  the  wealth\r\n\r\ncreating process in the KBE.  And without change, our current\r\n\r\neducation system would be found wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given much thought to this issue.\r\n\r\nI  think  the House would benefit from his comments  on  this\r\n\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, a common refrain\r\n\r\nand  lament  we  hear these days are the heavy  workload  and\r\n\r\nstress faced by students and teachers.  Here, I want to  echo\r\n\r\nthe  GPC  Chairman for Education, Dr Wang Kai  Yuen,  on  the\r\n\r\npoints he made.  Thus we hear the chorus of complaints  about\r\n\r\nthe  misgivings  expressed  in the school  ranking,  students\r\n\r\nbeing  streamed into Gifted and Special Assistance Programme,\r\n\r\nExpress  and Normal streams, class size could be smaller  and\r\n\r\nthe  declining mental health of our children.  Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  basic  concern is really the fear of parents that  their\r\n\r\nchild may not be able to cope and do well in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the pace of change has been frantic. So many\r\n\r\nthings  are happening.  I fear that our children are spending\r\n\r\ntoo  much  time  on  the computers, since the  time  that  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  IT  in schools.  There are non-academic  subjects\r\n\r\nand  healthy  sports  and recreational activities  which  our\r\n\r\nchildren  should be learning and doing, but are  not.   There\r\n\r\nare  so many demands, yet the time and resources are limited.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  take  stock  of the individual's  capacity  and\r\n\r\ncapability and help them prioritize accordingly.  We have  to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  children to organise themselves and  manage  their\r\n\r\ntime better as we adults do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents should know that their children have at least 40\r\n\r\nyears  of  active  working life ahead of  them.   To  have  a\r\n\r\nheadstart is to lay a strong foundation.  It requires patient\r\n\r\nnurturing.  If the children need more time, we ought to  give\r\n\r\nit to them.  We may wish to be quick, but we should not be in\r\n\r\na  hurry,  because  we understand \"make haste,  less  speed\".\r\n\r\nEven  more  important is the inculcation of good  values  and\r\n\r\nsound  principles in our young.  Parents themselves must  set\r\n\r\nthe right and good example for their children.  We seem to be\r\n\r\ndoing things for our young instead of showing them how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that our children have different gifts\r\n\r\nand talent endowments.  We should not ask the children to  do\r\n\r\ncourses  and subjects that they are not interested in.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  see  a  growing number of them dropping  out  of\r\n\r\nmedicine, legal practice and accountancy after graduation.  A\r\n\r\ncommon  reason offered was that they were doing it for  their\r\n\r\nparents.  How sad, they should be doing it for themselves and\r\n\r\nbe  proud  of it.  Mind you, we are talking about very  noble\r\n\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education can actively embark on a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive programme to guide the parents as to  how  they\r\n\r\nshould   educate   their  children  at  home.    Perhaps   in\r\n\r\npartnership between the teachers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparents,  we  can achieve better outcome in the progress  and\r\n\r\noverall development of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how he proposes to address the\r\n\r\ncommon concern of heavy workload and stressful schooling  and\r\n\r\nthe  consequential  effects  on  our  parents,  teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, last year, I spoke\r\n\r\nabout  the  education system that is mainly  focused  on  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of delivery of subjects and lessons and  therefore\r\n\r\nwe  have  achieved  well  in terms of measures  like  scoring\r\n\r\nstraight   `A's,  ranking  of  schools  based   on   academic\r\n\r\nexcellence  and achieving top marks in international  Science\r\n\r\nand  Mathematics competition.  The issue therefore is whether\r\n\r\nthe efficient education system has allowed us to produce good\r\n\r\ninnovators,  entrepreneurs, artists, sportsmen and  women  of\r\n\r\nexcellence in non-academic areas.  The real answer is that we\r\n\r\nhave limited success in these areas.  My main question to the\r\n\r\nMinister  is:  what  has  he done in implementing  the  `mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation'  approach in our education  system?   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  give specifics of what he really means by the  mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation programme and how he plans to implement this in\r\n\r\nschools?   To-date, I am still confused as to what  it  means\r\n\r\nand  not able to see the concrete examples of implementation.\r\n\r\nAre  our  schools set up to allow customisation of  education\r\n\r\nfor  our  children  of differing abilities  or  are  we  just\r\n\r\ncategorising  our  children according  to  academic  learning\r\n\r\nabilities, like we have been doing in the past?  How  are  we\r\n\r\nensuring that the system we have in place is able to identify\r\n\r\nnon-academic  talents and groom students of such  talents  to\r\n\r\nachieve  their  full  potential?   Does  our  school   system\r\n\r\nconsider grooming students to achieve excellence in such non-academic  areas as important as those who have done  well  in\r\n\r\nacademic  areas?  I have to admit that to-date,  I  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen   able  to  see  any  significant  impact  of  the  mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken about streaming of our children at the\r\n\r\nPrimary  4  level  and I would like to touch  on  this  again\r\n\r\ntoday.  Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  are so stressed these days, as we have  heard  from\r\n\r\nour  previous two speakers, that I do not think many of  them\r\n\r\nenjoy  going to school.  How then can we inculcate the  value\r\n\r\nof  lifelong  learning  if  they  get  disillusioned  by  our\r\n\r\neducation  system at such an early age?  I have  seen  in  my\r\n\r\ndaughter's  school, it was examination period, where  a  girl\r\n\r\nwas  struggling not to go for her test, and her parents  were\r\n\r\npulling her on one end and the teacher and the principal were\r\n\r\nall  encouraging her to go.  It was really a very distracting\r\n\r\nsight for the children around her too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we survey all the education systems around the world,\r\n\r\nwe  are the only country in the world that does streaming  at\r\n\r\nsuch  an  early age.  While the intended outcome is to  allow\r\n\r\nevery  child to learn at his or her pace, the actual  outcome\r\n\r\nis  that  we label them and eliminate them or greatly  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir  chances of getting back to the mainstream  Express  or\r\n\r\nNormal  (Academic) streams.  Can the Minister give statistics\r\n\r\nof  how many children streamed to the EM3 stream have made it\r\n\r\nback  to EM1 or EM2 streams in the primary schools?  And  how\r\n\r\nmany EM3 students, who went to the Normal (Technical) stream,\r\n\r\nmade it back to the Normal (Academic) and Express streams?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I attended a function recently organised by CDAC,\r\n\r\nMENDAKI and SINDA.  This is called Project Team, and we  have\r\n\r\nheard  about  it in this House recently.  The  programme  was\r\n\r\nintended  to  bring  children of various  races  and  streams\r\n\r\ntogether in trying to inculcate a sense of community and bond-building  among themselves.  When I actually  asked  some  of\r\n\r\nthem,  many  of them right from the beginning when  they  got\r\n\r\ntogether, segregated themselves according to the streams that\r\n\r\nthey came from, and basically treated each other differently.\r\n\r\nThose  from  the lower streams seem to be having  self-esteem\r\n\r\nissue and those from the higher streams seem to have a `high-class'  feeling issue.  If we start to develop this  kind  of\r\n\r\nattitude  at early ages, we will see real problems when  they\r\n\r\ngrow up as adults in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also curious to find out what programmes have been\r\n\r\nput  in place to promote creativity and lifelong learning  in\r\n\r\nour  schools.  Particularly, have there been any  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum which develop the creative mind and inculcate\r\n\r\nthe  value of lifelong learning?  I myself have not seen  any\r\n\r\nevidence  of this being done.  In fact, we still continue  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  the  academic issues and measures,  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthere have not been many changes.  And I do not think we will\r\n\r\nsee  any impact in trying to develop creativity and the issue\r\n\r\nof lifelong learning among our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, lest we get carried\r\n\r\naway  with  the notion that our education system is  full  of\r\n\r\nwarts and problems, I do want to bring the focus back to  the\r\n\r\npoint  that,  overall,  we  have  a  good  education  system.\r\n\r\nCertainly  that  is the feedback I get from parents  and,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  observers  both within and  outside  Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nthink   the  fact  that  we  are  raising  issues  that   are\r\n\r\nqualitative in nature suggests that we want to make  it  even\r\n\r\nbetter.  It would be a far greater cause of concern for us if\r\n\r\nwe  are  complaining about the quality of the instruction  we\r\n\r\nget in our schools, or that our students are not measuring up\r\n\r\nwhen we compare them with international standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in part, that is due to the various initiatives\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry has undertaken over the last few years,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  focusing on the hardware in terms  of  improving\r\n\r\nfacilities, the systems through school evaluation models  and\r\n\r\ninformation technology, and so on.  Also, it has demonstrated\r\n\r\na focus on perhaps the most important element - the teachers,\r\n\r\nthe  people  who make the system work.  In that  regard,  the\r\n\r\nterms of employment for teachers are important.  Salaries and\r\n\r\nbenefits  are an essential part.  One does not want to  over-emphasise this because I think there is more to a career than\r\n\r\njust  the  pay  and the benefits, but this  is  an  essential\r\n\r\nelement.   And  I would be pleased to know from the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat initiatives would be taken in that regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, as importantly, what other initiatives are\r\n\r\nbeing undertaken to enhance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   work   experience  of  our  teachers  in   the   school\r\n\r\nenvironment?  A common complaint is administrative load,  and\r\n\r\nthat  leading  to  stress.  Are there other measures  we  can\r\n\r\nundertake through employment of additional support  staff  or\r\n\r\nin terms of providing them with customised IT solutions which\r\n\r\nmight  minimise  these forms of burden in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  so that they can concentrate on what they do  best,\r\n\r\nwhich is, teach students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one feedback that we have obtained from the GPC for\r\n\r\nEducation is that perhaps in our education system, a  certain\r\n\r\nprosaic  utilitarian attitude is emerging.  Evidence of  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  in the form of the choice of subjects our students\r\n\r\nseem to be gravitating towards, with a particular emphasis on\r\n\r\nthe Sciences and Mathematics and away from the softer, harder-to-score subjects like the Humanities.  We have heard that in\r\n\r\nsome  of  the top schools, due to emphasis among the students\r\n\r\nthemselves, by choice, there would appear to be a  move  away\r\n\r\nfrom English Literature.  If they must do an Arts subject and\r\n\r\nas  required by the schools, they would prefer to do  history\r\n\r\nor  geography,  because it is easier  to  score  than  to  do\r\n\r\nLiterature, which generally, it seems, is a harder subject in\r\n\r\nwhich  to  get an `A' or a distinction.  This is attributable\r\n\r\nto   many  causes   -  that  we  over-emphasise  Science  and\r\n\r\nMathematics,  that  schools are too geared towards  achieving\r\n\r\nquantitative results, because of the ranking system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, whatever the cause, the question really is: is\r\n\r\nthis  an  example of market failure perhaps in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem?  In this day and age, when we are emphasising a broad-based  education  where we want to ensure that  our  students\r\n\r\ncome  out  with the capability to channel their energy  in  a\r\n\r\nbroad  range of areas of endeavour, because the needs of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment,  the economy, and our society  are  changing  so\r\n\r\nfast,  would  it not be important for us to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nstudents  have  a  broad-based  approach  in  their  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: is this a cause for\r\n\r\nconcern at this point?  Is there a marked trend?  If  it  is,\r\n\r\nis it a cause for concern?  In particular, is this an example\r\n\r\nof  perhaps  a  market failure where some form of  Government\r\n\r\nintervention  might be justified?  Just as, for example,  one\r\n\r\ncould  argue that the choice of mother tongue as an  academic\r\n\r\nsubject  might  not  be high on the list of  priority  for  a\r\n\r\nstudent  because of the difficulty to score points,  but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has seen fit to emphasise it as an essential  part\r\n\r\nof  education  process.  Could we adopt  a  similar  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the humanities?  If we do adopt such an attitude, how\r\n\r\ncan  we  structure the system to ensure that this becomes  an\r\n\r\nessential part of the total education experience our students\r\n\r\nhave in schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, our education\r\n\r\nsystem  continues to be a topic that generates what we should\r\n\r\nperhaps  simply  describe  as \"animated  conversation\"  where\r\n\r\nanywhere  and  anytime, you find a gathering of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho are parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Members before me have spoken on various\r\n\r\naspects  of  our  education  system  that  cause  stress  and\r\n\r\ndistress  to parents and children.  Sir, we have  a  dilemma.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry's view is that the fundamental problem lies  in\r\n\r\nparents'   unrealistic  expectations   of   their   children.\r\n\r\nParents,  on the other hand, are equally convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nproblem essentially resides in the rigidity of an unforgiving\r\n\r\nsystem.    When  you  analyse  the  stories  and  experiences\r\n\r\nrecounted,  the  issues  may be grouped  largely  into  three\r\n\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first relates to the thorny issue of our values - our practice of reducing everything to economics, of\r\n\r\nmeasuring  success and the dollars and cents that  come  with\r\n\r\nthe  high-paying  jobs  that  come  to  those  with  academic\r\n\r\nachievements that drive our parents to drive their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set relates to the many individual anecdotes\r\n\r\nof  teachers  who are less sensitive and less nurturing  than\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  considered adequate and satisfactory to guide  and\r\n\r\nhelp our children develop to the best of their abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third set relates to principals. The Ministry has\r\n\r\non  occasions before pointed out that it has over  the  years\r\n\r\nbeen  responsive  in  reviewing  policies,  for  example,  in\r\n\r\nreducing curriculum load.  Therefore, a number of operational\r\n\r\nissues,  such as, for example, starting times of  the  school\r\n\r\nday,  principals  have  been  given  full  autonomy  to  make\r\n\r\ndecisions.   It seems, however, that some principals  may  be\r\n\r\nover-zealous in pursuing academic results and rankings on the\r\n\r\none  hand,  or possibly not taking advantage of the  autonomy\r\n\r\ndelegated to them on the other.  However, when you hear  good\r\n\r\nstories of good schools, invariably, I think, you will find a\r\n\r\ngood  principal with initiative, supporting and managing  his\r\n\r\nor her staff well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at the problem of values, that is\r\n\r\nsomething that the Ministry of Education cannot solve on  its\r\n\r\nown  and which takes a long time to evolve and resolve.  When\r\n\r\nyou  look at the anecdotes that relate to teachers, I  really\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  how  one  can go about  ensuring  that  25,000\r\n\r\nteachers perform consistently up to the standards that we all\r\n\r\nwant for the instruction of our children.  So it seems to  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  best  bet  we may have that would  enable  a  more\r\n\r\nimmediate   better  management  of  parents'  anxieties   and\r\n\r\nfrustrations  is  to  pull out all stops  and  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nidentification  and accelerated development of  good  dynamic\r\n\r\nprinciples  to  optimise  the  management  of  resources  and\r\n\r\noperation  of  issues  and the insightful  implementation  of\r\n\r\npolicies  at individual school level.  I recognise that  300-plus  good  principals sound a lot more manageable  a  number\r\n\r\nthan  25,000  good teachers.  But it is still a  tall  order.\r\n\r\nHowever, by grouping or clustering schools together  and  the\r\n\r\nassignment of particularly strong principals so that they may\r\n\r\nbe  well  distributed  among the  clusters  could  achieve  a\r\n\r\nmultiplier effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more thing, Sir, that is needed and that is\r\n\r\nto be sure that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  of  performance must be clear and  consistent  with\r\n\r\npolicy directions so that principals are not incentivised  to\r\n\r\nbehave in incongruent ways.  In other words, for example, the\r\n\r\nMinistry says that ranking of schools in academic performance\r\n\r\nis  not  the  be-all  and the end-all and  other  things  are\r\n\r\nimportant  too, then principals' performance,  appraisal  and\r\n\r\nprogress in their careers should reflect that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will take my observations into\r\n\r\nconsideration  as an attempt at a shorter term solution  even\r\n\r\nas we grapple with the longer term and even more difficult to\r\n\r\nresolve  issues  and  challenges  in  the  education  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  has  been scoring highly in preparing  Singaporean\r\n\r\nchildren  academically  and is now  endeavouring  to  further\r\n\r\neducate and equip them to face the information technology and\r\n\r\nnew  economy age.  Thus far, MOE has been concentrating  more\r\n\r\non imparting knowledge to the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for an ideal education, MOE should treat the\r\n\r\neducation of our children in a more holistic way.  The  well-being  of  the  children, such as their mental  state,  their\r\n\r\nsocial  requirements and their physical needs, should be  the\r\n\r\nconcern of all the teachers as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers should not just concentrate on teaching\r\n\r\nthem  the  academic syllabus.  They are very much in  contact\r\n\r\nwith  our  children  and are ideally  suited  to  take  added\r\n\r\ninterest  and  be  concerned with their students  in  a  more\r\n\r\nholistic way.  They should also teach and help them cope with\r\n\r\nlife.  I am not, in any way, suggesting that we diminish  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of parents.  I am suggesting  that  teachers\r\n\r\nbe  equipped with skills and encouraged to identify  students\r\n\r\nwith  difficulties, be it social, mental or  even  financial,\r\n\r\nand refer them for assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 2,358 new cases of children aged below 18 were\r\n\r\nregistered   at  the  Government  psychiatric  clinics.    As\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier by Dr Wang Kai Yuen,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  recently, a 12-year old student jumped  to  her  death.\r\n\r\nSir, could stress, maybe due to the heavy school load or  the\r\n\r\nunrealistic expectations of parents, be the cause?   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nour  children should also be taught how to cope  with  stress\r\n\r\nfrom  young  to  attain their maximum potential.   The  early\r\n\r\ndetection of those children who are vulnerable to stress will\r\n\r\nsave them from poor performance and mental breakdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, schools have no choice but to get\r\n\r\ninvolved  with  some parents.  This area  must  be  expanded.\r\n\r\nOften  times,  we  need to solve problems  at  the  root  and\r\n\r\nsometimes the parents may have to be advised.  Sir, it  would\r\n\r\nalso  be  worthwhile for the Ministry of  Education  and  the\r\n\r\nschools  to  put in more effort to alleviate the anxiety  and\r\n\r\nbetter  inform  the  parents on issues,  such  as  streaming,\r\n\r\nbanding, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holistic and comprehensive education would be ideal in\r\n\r\nhelping  parents  with  school-going kids  balance  work  and\r\n\r\nfamily commitments. We may, perhaps, try matching work  hours\r\n\r\nwith  school hours.  Sir, since we are tending towards single\r\n\r\nsession  schools, we can have the children stay back  in  the\r\n\r\nschool  to  do  \"homework\" or have \"remedials\"  whilst  their\r\n\r\nparents  are still at work.  Another way of helping  parents,\r\n\r\nespecially  those who are working, is to organise  the  extra\r\n\r\ncurricular   pursuits  collectively  in  the  schools   after\r\n\r\nclasses.   This  will  save parents  having  to  ferry  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to and from different places for these hobbies.   I\r\n\r\nwould like again to plead with the Minister for Education  on\r\n\r\nanother item.  Would he give the directive for our schools to\r\n\r\nstart  later so that children do not have to wake up  in  the\r\n\r\nwee hours each morning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister for Education to look\r\n\r\ninto  the  above issues favourably.

But  does  such  an\r\n\r\nenviable success status come with a price?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore on the \"The Singapore Family\" revealed that the\r\n\r\ngreatest  worry  for  about 45% of  families  came  from  the\r\n\r\nproblems   associated   with  their   children's   education.\r\n\r\nSingaporean parents have also frequently mentioned children's\r\n\r\neducation  as the contributory factor in opting  for  smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is there any possibility in getting the excellent\r\n\r\nresult without getting \"The Singapore Family\" so stressed up?\r\n\r\nIf  so,  what are the steps that must be taken?  In this  new\r\n\r\neconomy  and information technology age, stressful education,\r\n\r\nbe  it real or perceived, is a very compelling reason for  us\r\n\r\nto  improve  the  teaching  and  learning  processes  of  the\r\n\r\neducation here.  The past practice of rote learning should be\r\n\r\nchanged towards emphasis on understanding and application  of\r\n\r\nsubjects.   I agree with my parliamentary colleague,  Mr  Loh\r\n\r\nMeng  See,  that it is time to look into our teaching  method\r\n\r\nand  syllabus in our schools.  Sir, the syllabus needs to  be\r\n\r\nrevamped  to make it less demanding so that the teachers  can\r\n\r\ncomplete  it  and the students can understand what  has  been\r\n\r\ntaught.   Overloading pupils unnecessarily with homework  and\r\n\r\ntests  should  be  minimised.   Worse  still,  we  would   be\r\n\r\nexpecting  students to master by themselves those  topics  in\r\n\r\ncertain subjects that cannot be covered in the classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, Sir, spend as much as $30 million each\r\n\r\nyear on their children's tuition.  This is far too much.  Why\r\n\r\nis  there such a need for so much tuition?  It will be a good\r\n\r\nidea if our schools can provide some sort of tutorial classes\r\n\r\nafter  normal school hours, not for giving the children extra\r\n\r\nwork but for helping them cope with their homework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for the ranking of schools may have to be\r\n\r\nexpanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements  and\r\n\r\ngrade scores.  More weightage should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  for  other  markers relevant  to  the  present  times.\r\n\r\nRanking  should take attainments in developing the potentials\r\n\r\nof  students in information technology, in sports and in  the\r\n\r\narts  into  consideration.  Sir, this will ease much  of  the\r\n\r\npressure put upon students, parents as well as teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is every parent's aspiration to see his or her\r\n\r\nchildren  attain  tertiary education.  But not  all  children\r\n\r\nhave  the  same  capabilities and there  are  certainly  many\r\n\r\nvariants.  Having flexibility in varsity-entry criteria  will\r\n\r\nease the stress from many students and parents.  Expansion in\r\n\r\nthis  area will be useful.  Parents can then settle down  and\r\n\r\nallow  their children to develop their own unique  potentials\r\n\r\nthough they may not conform to the norm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry of Education will consider the\r\n\r\nsuggestions I have made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools are the main providers of education for our children.\r\n\r\nWhile  parents  are  not happy with the  standards  of  these\r\n\r\nschools, they are horrified of the behaviour of the students.\r\n\r\nThis   is   generally  how  the  neighbourhood  schools   are\r\n\r\nperceived.   We need to correct this perception  for  it  has\r\n\r\nserious  repercussion on the community.  If  a  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschool  is  perceived as being problematic, good students  in\r\n\r\nthe community would not want to go there.  Firstly, this will\r\n\r\nput  pressures on the good schools and frustrates  successful\r\n\r\nstudents and their parents.  Secondly, by failing to  attract\r\n\r\ngood  students,  the  quality of  the  student  body  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools will drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that a school with a poor image saps the\r\n\r\nself-esteem  and  morale of its students.  The  teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals  are probably similarly affected.  Low esteem  and\r\n\r\nmorale leads to poor behaviour which explains the behavioural\r\n\r\nproblems of these students.  The situation is aggravated when\r\n\r\nthe  quality of the student body drops.  It thus goes into  a\r\n\r\nvicious cycle with the problems worsening with the years.  We\r\n\r\nmust break this vicious cycle.  Can the Ministry do more  for\r\n\r\nour neighbourhood schools, especially\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose poorly perceived by the community?  Can more resources,\r\n\r\nsuch as teachers, be provided?  With more teachers, the class\r\n\r\nsize  can  be  smaller so that each student can receive  more\r\n\r\ncare  and  attention  and help.  This  will  be  particularly\r\n\r\nhelpful with English Language teachers as the standard of the\r\n\r\nlanguage is generally low in neighbourhood schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to give more attention to our\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  schools.   These are  the  main  providers  of\r\n\r\neducation for our young in the community.  The well-being  of\r\n\r\nour  schools  bears  upon  the  quality  of  our  young.   As\r\n\r\nneighbourhood schools are an integral part of the  community,\r\n\r\nI  also  urge the schools to work with our community leaders.\r\n\r\nI  am sure that our community leaders are eager to help build\r\n\r\nschools that the community can be proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, our\r\n\r\nschool  system  has undergone major changes and restructuring\r\n\r\nover  the past two to three decades.  Tremendous improvements\r\n\r\nhave  been  made and great efforts have been put  in  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  prepare our students in recent  years  for  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of a new knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Ministry of Education has devolved\r\n\r\ngreater  autonomy to some schools, some pre-selected schools,\r\n\r\nusing basically two schemes.  One is the independent schools,\r\n\r\nand  the  other is the autonomous schools.  These are  indeed\r\n\r\nsteps  in  the  right direction.  With greater  independence,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  more  creativity and motivation  among  the\r\n\r\nadministration  and  teaching staff  to  serve  the  students\r\n\r\nbetter.   Each  effort  has certainly,  in  my  view,  helped\r\n\r\nstudents  perform  better in schools and have  also  nurtured\r\n\r\nbetter all-round development in our students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the next step, I wonder if it is the appropriate\r\n\r\ntime  to  allow  private organisations to  run  some  of  our\r\n\r\nschools.   I  am  saying beyond what is  practised  now,  ie,\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided    schools,   allow    completely    private\r\n\r\norganisations  to  run  some of our Government  schools.   In\r\n\r\nother words, I wonder if it is feasible to privatise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of our schools beyond the concept of independence of our\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided schools.  While the Ministry should not  let\r\n\r\ngo  everything, make it laissez-faire, it should set  certain\r\n\r\npreconditions on curriculum, discipline and other basics, and\r\n\r\nin  return for some Government funding.  I wonder if it would\r\n\r\nbe  interesting to evaluate and perhaps set up a pilot scheme\r\n\r\nto  allow commercial organisations, particularly, educational\r\n\r\norganisations, either local or foreign, to run  some  of  our\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept will not be entirely similar. It is,\r\n\r\nin  some  ways,  like what the Government has  done  for  our\r\n\r\nuniversity by setting up a private university, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nManagement  University.   Sir,  the  Ministry  has  begun  to\r\n\r\nintroduce greater creativity and put less emphasis on content\r\n\r\nand  greater enrichment modules have been added to the school\r\n\r\ncurriculum, allowing the appropriate private operators to run\r\n\r\nour schools and produce even more outstanding results in this\r\n\r\ndirection.  It is certainly worth experimenting this,  and  I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the  Minister  can  give  this  suggestion   some\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, every child in\r\n\r\nour  schools is born differently.  Each has his  or  her  own\r\n\r\nlevel  of  intelligence, but our school system  assumes  that\r\n\r\nevery  child has an IQ of 120.  This is the level of IQ which\r\n\r\nevery  university  graduate is supposed to  possess,  and  it\r\n\r\nimposes  a  heavy  load of school work on them  from  primary\r\n\r\nschool  onwards and, at the same time, stream them at Primary\r\n\r\n4,  and again at Primary 6.  Primary 6 is the level when they\r\n\r\nsit for their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, I read in the papers that parents\r\n\r\ncomplained  of the difficulty of the Mathematics and  English\r\n\r\npapers.   They said that even adults did not know how  to  do\r\n\r\nthose   papers,  how  then  could  the  children  pass  their\r\n\r\nexaminations based on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  papers?  Not only parents have complained.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  Mr Goh Chok Tong, himself commented  that  he  was\r\n\r\nshocked  to  see  from Primary 1, the children  are  learning\r\n\r\nwords which he would not have known until Primary 4 or 5.  It\r\n\r\nwas reported in the Straits Times of 22nd January.  The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister asked the Education Minister, \"Is the school  system\r\n\r\ntoo  stressful?\"  My view is that, for children  who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  particularly high IQ, and for children  who  are  late-developers, the answer, of course, is yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our school system, with a heavy curriculum, is too\r\n\r\nstressful, because there are reports in our local press  that\r\n\r\nour  primary school kids are being sent by their  parents  to\r\n\r\npsychiatrists for treatment.  Parents are worried  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren, because they know that if their children are unable\r\n\r\nto  pass  the  PSLE,  they shall be  branded  as  rejects  or\r\n\r\nfailures  and streamed to the slow-learner Normal stream.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  psychological harm done to those children  at  an\r\n\r\nearly  age  can  have an adverse effect on their  self-worth,\r\n\r\nself-esteem,  self-respect and self-confidence.   They  shall\r\n\r\ngrow  up  forever feeling that way.  It is important  that  a\r\n\r\nchild  has  self-confidence, otherwise, it  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndifficult for him to succeed when he grows up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to make our school less\r\n\r\nstressful by not imposing such a heavy workload on our school\r\n\r\nchildren,  especially  at  the  primary  school   level.    A\r\n\r\ncommittee  should be set up to look into how  to  lessen  the\r\n\r\nheavy curriculum in our schools.  It would be a sad day  when\r\n\r\nour  children end up as mental patients and who are not  able\r\n\r\nto  take charge of their own lives and their own affairs when\r\n\r\nthey  grow  up.  They shall become a liability to the  state.\r\n\r\nChildren are our future assets, and we cannot afford to  lose\r\n\r\nany one of them, if we can help it.

Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\norder  to  attain  the IT 2000 objectives, the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nrequired that a certain amount of time be set aside to  apply\r\n\r\nIT  in  the  teaching  of  the  various  subjects,  including\r\n\r\nChinese.  Development of software for the teaching of Chinese\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  has  to start from scratch, as  the  softwares\r\n\r\npreviously developed in Taiwan and China are not suitable for\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  of the low level and narrow  syllabus  of\r\n\r\nChinese in the schools in Singapore. Over the last few years,\r\n\r\nour  Chinese  teachers have suffered all  kinds  of  torment.\r\n\r\nApart from learning computer and IT knowledge, they have also\r\n\r\nto  spend  a  lot of time in the development  and  design  of\r\n\r\nsoftware for the teaching of Chinese in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not know how effective, or whether there\r\n\r\nis  any  value-added effect to the teaching of  Chinese  with\r\n\r\nthese softwares.    First of all, the teaching of language is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the  teaching of other subjects  because  in\r\n\r\nlanguage,  the  main  emphasis  is  on  listening,  speaking,\r\n\r\nreading  and  writing, whereas for the  other  subjects,  the\r\n\r\nemphasis is on the absorption of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are many multimedia softwares in the\r\n\r\nteaching  of Chinese. What effects have they on the  teaching\r\n\r\nof  Chinese?   Would they really arouse the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents in the learning of Chinese?   I think it is the  way\r\n\r\nit is taught\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the personality of the teachers that make the difference.\r\n\r\nA  resourceful  teacher can bring life to the  classroom  and\r\n\r\ncommand the respect and attention of the students.  Only then\r\n\r\ncan   the   students  find  the  learning  of   the   subject\r\n\r\ninteresting.   I am not against the use of IT technology  for\r\n\r\nthe  teaching of Chinese.  What I want to know is whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  this  computerisation  of  Chinese  teaching  would   be\r\n\r\nworthwhile  and  whether or not it has  added  value  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching of Chinese in Singapore?  Or is all this fuss  being\r\n\r\nkicked up just because the officials concerned are trying  to\r\n\r\nfulfill the objectives set down by the Ministry of Education?\r\n\r\nI hope that we will review the effects of this IT application\r\n\r\nin the teaching of Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to talk about creative learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam lamented on the degree of\r\n\r\ndifficulties in the Mathematics syllabus and that parents are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to help their children.  We have now entered  into\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century,  and we should not  remain  in  the  19th\r\n\r\ncentury.  There are changes in the high technologies  in  the\r\n\r\n21st  century.   Our  pupils, I  think,  rank  first  in  the\r\n\r\nInternational Mathematics Competition.  What is important  is\r\n\r\nthat  students  should  understand  the  subject,  not  their\r\n\r\nparents.   When I was young, I could not even read ABC.   But\r\n\r\nmy  two-year grandson is already able to recognise from A  to\r\n\r\nZ.   Therefore, we should not put any restrictions on pupils'\r\n\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the language competence among\r\n\r\nthe  \"O\"  level  and \"A\" level students.  I have  found  that\r\n\r\ntheir  writing ability is far from satisfactory.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  double  our efforts in  this  aspect.   If  our\r\n\r\nstudents have to spend a lot of time on the learning  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and  yet can only listen and speak in  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  but not able to write it well, I can understand.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  they  cannot even write properly in the first language,\r\n\r\nthen  something must be seriously wrong somewhere.  Recently,\r\n\r\nI  came  across  many students who could not write  a  proper\r\n\r\nletter  to apply for a job.  This reminds me of the so-called\r\n\r\nwriting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nability  crisis that took place in the US in the 70s.   There\r\n\r\nwere  23 million Americans who were only semi-literate.  They\r\n\r\ncould  only  read  simple advertising materials  and  labels.\r\n\r\nThey  were  not  able to read articles in the newspapers  and\r\n\r\nmagazines, and university undergraduates could not even write\r\n\r\na proper essay.  A highly-qualified manager could not write a\r\n\r\nproper  note.   Many Government officers and scientists  were\r\n\r\ntherefore  asked to attend crash courses in  writing.   I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about the crisis in America because I am worried that\r\n\r\nthe same writing crisis might occur in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in a very advanced high-tech society.\r\n\r\nWatching  TV  and  surfing  the Internet  have  replaced  the\r\n\r\nreading  of  newspapers,  and  phone  calls  and  email   are\r\n\r\ngradually   replacing  letter-writing.   Going  on   to   the\r\n\r\nInternet, we can  communicate to someone thousands  of  miles\r\n\r\naway at the click of the mouse.  Jargons and short forms  are\r\n\r\nused  unreservedly over the emails, eg, \"by the way\" is typed\r\n\r\nas  \"BTW\",   \"for  your  information\" is  \"FYI\",  etc.   What\r\n\r\nworries me is that if our students are not able to use  their\r\n\r\npen  to write, then their writing ability will drop.  You may\r\n\r\nsay   that  we  have  essay-writing  competitions  among  the\r\n\r\nstudents and their results are good, but this happens only to\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  the  cream  in the  schools,  the  very  top\r\n\r\nstudents.   Those  students  who  are  not  so  good  in  the\r\n\r\nlanguages  will  never  be selected  to  take  part  in  such\r\n\r\ncompetitions.  Therefore, we cannot measure the  standard  of\r\n\r\nthe  writing  ability of our students in general  by  looking\r\n\r\njust at the results of the essay-writing competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that the Ministry could strengthen the\r\n\r\nteaching  of writing through creative education.   We  should\r\n\r\nencourage  pupils to read and write more, so  that  they  can\r\n\r\nwrite presentable minutes and reports.  The class should read\r\n\r\nall  sorts of books, and not just the same old textbook,  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  should make it a rule that every student must  read\r\n\r\ncertain articles from the Straits Times and the Lianhe Zaobao\r\n\r\nand to comment on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  comments or reports would then be marked and  assessed\r\n\r\nby  the  teachers.  Only through this method will the writing\r\n\r\nability  of our pupils be raised and satisfaction be  derived\r\n\r\nout  of  writing.   I  hope  the  Minister  can  consider  my\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nin  his  National  Day  Rally Speech  last  year,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said that he was prepared to increase  spending  on\r\n\r\neducation from 3.6% to perhaps 4.5% of GDP over the next  few\r\n\r\nyears, provided of course that the funds are put to good use.\r\n\r\nThis year, the Minister for Finance has indeed increased  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education's budget by $480 million, an  increase\r\n\r\nof  8%,  and  this  is higher than this year's  expected  GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of  5%-7%.   So we  are  moving  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these additional resources, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation will be able to implement worthwhile programmes  to\r\n\r\nbring us closer to realising our vision of \"Thinking Schools,\r\n\r\nLearning  Nation\"  and  making  an  Ability-Driven  Education\r\n\r\nhappen,  so  that all our people can receive  a  well-rounded\r\n\r\neducation and are developed to their full potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priorities this year are in three broad areas.\r\n\r\nFirst,  our  schools; second, post-secondary  and  continuing\r\n\r\neducation; and, third, the pre-school sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, we will see through the major programmes\r\n\r\ninitiated  in  the  last few years, such as  the  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology Masterplan; bringing all our schools up to  modern\r\n\r\nstandards through rebuilding and improvements under PRIME;  a\r\n\r\nmore  well-rounded  and  creative curriculum;  and  promoting\r\n\r\nexcellence  both  in  teaching  and  administration  in   our\r\n\r\nschools.  But the real focus of my Ministry for schools  this\r\n\r\nyear  will  be  teachers  - recruiting  and  developing  good\r\n\r\nteachers  and making sure that we have enough of them  to  do\r\n\r\nall  the good things that we want to do in the coming  years.\r\n\r\nGood  teachers are the key to all that we do. They give  life\r\n\r\nand reality to all the good things we want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  in  education, and deliver the quality education  with  a\r\n\r\nhuman touch that our children need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong school system, the other key pieces of the\r\n\r\neducational  process  are the pre- and  post-school  sectors.\r\n\r\nThis year, the Ministry of Education will be putting in place\r\n\r\nmore  pieces to strengthen the education system at both  ends\r\n\r\nof  the  education time continuum.  At the front end  of  the\r\n\r\ncontinuum, my colleague, Dr Aline Wong,  will say more  later\r\n\r\ntoday about what steps we will be taking from now on to raise\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  pre-school education  to  provide  a  sound\r\n\r\nbeginning  for  all our children. At the  other  end  of  the\r\n\r\neducation  time continuum, Mr Peter Chen will tell  you  more\r\n\r\nabout  expanding opportunities for further education  in  our\r\n\r\npost-secondary   sector,   to   provide   Singaporeans   with\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  acquire  and  update  their   skills   and\r\n\r\nknowledge for the new economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that as we get down to discuss individual\r\n\r\nissues in detail, this broad overview of our priorities  will\r\n\r\nhelp  Members place the discussion on education today  within\r\n\r\nthe larger context of what we are working to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this segment, I will address Members' questions on\r\n\r\ncurrent  initiatives  in our school  system.   Last  year,  I\r\n\r\ninformed  this House that the Ministry of Education  aims  to\r\n\r\nmove  towards ability-driven education to develop and harness\r\n\r\nthe  talents  of  our students.  By customising  learning  to\r\n\r\ndifferent needs and abilities, we aim for an education system\r\n\r\nthat  provides  students of all abilities with  an  education\r\n\r\nthat maximises their potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not there yet, but we are making progress. Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit   Singh   asked  what  we  are   doing   with   mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation.  Mass customisation has been a feature of  our\r\n\r\neducation  system for many years.  Our streaming system  more\r\n\r\nclosely  matches  curriculum  and  the  pace  and  method  of\r\n\r\nlearning with the abilities and aptitudes of our children  so\r\n\r\nthat  each  student can proceed at his or her own  pace.   Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  was talking about a curriculum which is too heavy  and\r\n\r\nwhich appears to be catering only to the most able students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   therefore  assume  that  he  is  a  strong  supporter  of\r\n\r\nstreaming,   because  streaming  addresses   precisely   this\r\n\r\nproblem,  ie,  providing  a  differentiated  curriculum   for\r\n\r\nstudents of different abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a system, streaming is better than requiring every\r\n\r\nstudent  to fit into only one prescribed programme of  study.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the more we want education to be customised, what  we\r\n\r\nwould  end up with are more streams and sub-streams.  Through\r\n\r\nstreaming  and giving those who need it a lighter  curriculum\r\n\r\nor  more  time,  we  have  reduced  educational  wastage  and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  raised  the  educational  attainment   of   our\r\n\r\nstudents.  In 1980, before streaming, only 58% of a Primary 1\r\n\r\ncohort  completed secondary school.  By the  year  2000,  the\r\n\r\nproportion was 93%.  The alternative to streaming is not that\r\n\r\neveryone  will suddenly be able to pass in the top stream  or\r\n\r\nExpress  stream.  The alternative to streaming is  that  many\r\n\r\nchildren will fail and they will drop out of school and  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be there in any of the other streams.  That is  the\r\n\r\nreal  alternative to streaming.  That was where  we  were  in\r\n\r\n1980  when  only 58% completed secondary school, compared  to\r\n\r\n93% today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked how many people actually made\r\n\r\nthe  transition from one stream to another.  There  are  some\r\n\r\nstatistics here.  In 1999, 382 Secondary 1 Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nstudents  transferred  from  Normal  (Technical)  to   Normal\r\n\r\n(Academic) stream in Secondary 2, and another 347 Secondary 1\r\n\r\nNormal  (Academic)  students  transferred  to  the  secondary\r\n\r\nExpress  stream.   The system is an open  one.   We  must  be\r\n\r\nrealistic and give the students the curriculum and  the  time\r\n\r\nto be able to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, 38% of Normal (Academic) stream students\r\n\r\nwho  took their \"O\" level in 1999 entered the polytechnic  or\r\n\r\npre-university  institutions.  If they were  not  given  five\r\n\r\nyears,  rather than four years, to do their \"O\" levels,  they\r\n\r\nmight  not have made it at all.  This is the real alternative\r\n\r\nif we want to do away with streaming.  I would ask Members to\r\n\r\nthink about it carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, for mass customisation, we now also have\r\n\r\nprogrammes to cater to students with a range of aptitudes and\r\n\r\nabilities who need more support. We have the Gifted Education\r\n\r\nProgramme  and  elective programmes in  languages,  arts  and\r\n\r\nmusic.    The  Ministry  of  Education  is  also  encouraging\r\n\r\nautonomous  schools  to develop niche areas  to  nurture  the\r\n\r\ntalents  and  abilities of their students.   School  clusters\r\n\r\nhave  set  up  centres  for music, the arts  and  science  to\r\n\r\nprovide  enrichment  for  students  with  the  aptitude   and\r\n\r\ninterest.  We  support the establishment of a  sports  school\r\n\r\nunder  the  auspices of the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports.  But whether or not we would have top sportsmen,\r\n\r\nas Mr Inderjit Singh hopes and which I hope too, also depends\r\n\r\non  the  talents  we have in our talent pool,  and  also  the\r\n\r\ninclination  and desire of students and parents  to  want  to\r\n\r\npursue this line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo said that schools should look out for weaker\r\n\r\nstudents  and  those  facing problems so  that  they  can  be\r\n\r\nassisted.  Other MPs have also spoken about helping kids  who\r\n\r\nare  weaker.   Not  all the programmes in mass  customisation\r\n\r\nhave  an academic focus, not all are examinable, and not  all\r\n\r\nare  for the top kids.  Many are simply there to cater to the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the students to enrich their experiences.   And\r\n\r\nwe have programmes to support students who need more support.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  for example, we introduced the \"B\" syllabus  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  have difficulties coping with the  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguages.  And we have the Learning Support Programme, which\r\n\r\nhas  been  operating for some years now, which is implemented\r\n\r\nin  all  our primary schools which help P1 and P2 pupils  who\r\n\r\nare  weak  in  English.   There  is  also  the  programme  to\r\n\r\nEncourage Achievement and Better Learning (ENABLE) to support\r\n\r\nstudents who are not achieving their potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principals and teachers want to do their best for\r\n\r\ntheir  students, and they run many programmes to  help  their\r\n\r\nstudents,  such  as remedial classes for academically  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents, or enrichment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes and co-curricular activities. The community  helps\r\n\r\ntoo through programmes organised by the self-help groups.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  mind parents also helping their children with  work,\r\n\r\nsometimes  with tuition too.  Of course, they should  not  go\r\n\r\noverboard.  It is not something which the school can entirely\r\n\r\ndo and it is not something that I can stop if parents want to\r\n\r\ndo more for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents play the most important part in partnering\r\n\r\nschools to support, motivate and encourage their children  to\r\n\r\ndo  the best that they can, and yet, to know when not to push\r\n\r\nthem  too  far,  or  too  hard.   Parents'  expectations  and\r\n\r\nattitudes  have  a  strong  bearing  on  the  stress   levels\r\n\r\nexperienced by our young and how our young cope with  school.\r\n\r\nI  know it is not easy to be a parent, having some experience\r\n\r\nmyself, and all of us want to do the best that we can for our\r\n\r\nchildren. Schools too want to do the best that they  can  for\r\n\r\ntheir students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and schools need to work together to bring out\r\n\r\nthe best from our children, be it streaming, examinations  or\r\n\r\nremedial  lessons, or enrichment or CCA, so that  programmes,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  designed to provide a range of opportunities  and\r\n\r\nsupport   to  various  groups  of  students  with   different\r\n\r\nabilities  and aptitudes, do not become a source  of  anxiety\r\n\r\nfor parents and their children. Streaming at Primary 4 is one\r\n\r\nexample.  There is no point overloading children with  higher\r\n\r\nmother tongue in EM1 if they do not have the aptitude or  are\r\n\r\nunable to cope.  We should remember that the final choice  of\r\n\r\nwhich  stream  to place their child in after P4  really  lies\r\n\r\nwith  the  parents.  We have many parents who opt to  do  the\r\n\r\nmore  demanding EM1 stream for their children, and  very  few\r\n\r\nwho opt out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, stress comes from a mismatch between\r\n\r\nexpectation  and  achievement.   The  education  system,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  our society and families, can offer so much  more  to\r\n\r\nour  young  people  today - not just  in  school,  but  piano\r\n\r\nlessons,  extra  tuition, holidays abroad, computers  -  that\r\n\r\nthere is just so much on the plate to choose from and compete\r\n\r\nfor time and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention.   But  the  day and the year have  not  grown  any\r\n\r\nlonger.  I suppose that psychiatric care for some children is\r\n\r\na  manifestation  of the increased complexity  of  life  that\r\n\r\nyoung  people  today  face.  To deal  with  stress,  schools,\r\n\r\nparents and society need to understand that while we want the\r\n\r\nbest  for  our children, we, all of us, should not push  them\r\n\r\nbeyond  their  limits.   Children  are  different  in   their\r\n\r\npotential  and  their  needs, and we need  to  encourage  and\r\n\r\nsupport them to do the best that they are able to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the partnership between schools, parents\r\n\r\nand the wider community in nurturing and helping our young to\r\n\r\ngrow,  Parent-Teacher Associations or Parent  Support  Groups\r\n\r\nhave  been set up in many schools. These provide parents with\r\n\r\nan  avenue to work with the school for the benefit  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren's education and welfare.  Parent-teacher conferences\r\n\r\nmay  also be initiated by the parent or the teacher any  time\r\n\r\nduring  the  year  to  discuss the  child's  development  and\r\n\r\nperformance in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complement the efforts of schools in building home-school links, an advisory committee called COMPASS,\r\n\r\ncomprising  representatives from the community  and  parents,\r\n\r\nand  chaired by myself, was set up two years ago in 1999. The\r\n\r\nrole   of   COMPASS   is  to  promote  and   strengthen   the\r\n\r\ncollaboration between schools, parents and the  community  in\r\n\r\nensuring the wholesome and total development of our children.\r\n\r\nWe  have distributed to Members the COMPASS booklet on  home,\r\n\r\nschool  and community partnerships which sets out  the  roles\r\n\r\nschools,  parents  and community play in ensuring  the  well-being of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work towards greater collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween  home and school and encourage more open dialogue  to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  children  grow,  and  help  schools,  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents develop healthy and realistic expectations  of  each\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang has an interesting observation. He suggested\r\n\r\nthat  our  education system is too demanding because although\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren   do   better  in  schools  in   all   international\r\n\r\ncomparisons, by the time they graduate from university,  they\r\n\r\nare no different from other overseas graduates.  So why study\r\n\r\nso hard in school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang mixes up two things. International comparisons\r\n\r\nat   the  school  level,  such  as  the  Third  International\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science Study where Singapore  Secondary  2\r\n\r\nstudents  emerged first in Mathematics and second in Science,\r\n\r\nlook  at  the performance of the whole population of students\r\n\r\nat  that  level. Dr Wang was comparing, anecdotally, I  might\r\n\r\nadd,  and  not  based  on  any studies,  between  people  who\r\n\r\ngraduate  from  the same tertiary institutions,  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nsame  courses.  The people who graduate from the same courses\r\n\r\nin  the same higher education institutions can be expected to\r\n\r\ndo  no  better nor worse than others who similarly  graduate.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  our  students  who  study  at  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nuniversities do very well in those universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the proper comparison to make? If you look\r\n\r\nat the proportion of our students who make it to the tertiary\r\n\r\nlevel,  and the types of courses that they study, and compare\r\n\r\nthat  against  other countries, it is quite  clear  that  our\r\n\r\nschool system gives our students a stronger foundation and  a\r\n\r\nlong  term advantage over their peers in other countries.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to quote from a yet unpublished study by Dr  Andy\r\n\r\nGreen  from  the University of London Institute of Education.\r\n\r\nHe  compared the whole education from primary school  through\r\n\r\nto  post-graduate education in Singapore and the UK, and  the\r\n\r\nsystems  are very comparable. It is more difficult to compare\r\n\r\nthe US system because there are differences, levels and types\r\n\r\nof  examinations and so forth.  The British  system  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore system are very comparable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Andy Green concluded that at every level through to\r\n\r\nbasic degrees, we do better than the UK, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Comparable data on rates of qualification in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  England  in  1998  show  that  Singapore  has  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion of young people gaining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualification at each level, except post graduate.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  larger  proportion  of  the  cohort  entering  higher\r\n\r\neducation  courses than the UK. In 1998, it can be  estimated\r\n\r\nthat  over 55% of an age group in Singapore enrol on a higher\r\n\r\neducation  course at diploma or first degree level.   In  the\r\n\r\nUK,  total  entrants to higher education in 1998  represented\r\n\r\nabout 36% of the 18-20 year old cohort.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics show starker differences when we look at\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  who do Mathematics and Science, in  particular,\r\n\r\nAdvanced  Mathematics.  Some 20% of each cohort in  Singapore\r\n\r\ngained  a  Mathematics A level, compared with 7% in  the  UK.\r\n\r\nThis  strong grounding in mathematics and science allows  our\r\n\r\nstudents  to  pursue  more  challenging  courses  than  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in the UK.  If we look at the UK  and  the  US,\r\n\r\nthey  are  lamenting that their own people are  not  studying\r\n\r\nengineering.   Their  engineering  schools  are  filled  with\r\n\r\nforeigners including Singaporeans.  In contrast, NUS, NTU and\r\n\r\nour  polytechnics produce large numbers of people trained  in\r\n\r\nengineering and technology.  74% of our polytechnic  students\r\n\r\nand  56%  of  NUS/NTU  students do  science  and  engineering\r\n\r\ncourses.   I quote from Dr Green's study again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore produces a large number of engineering\r\n\r\ngraduates  relative to its population size.   5%  of  an  age\r\n\r\ngroup   in   Singapore  graduate  from  first  degree   level\r\n\r\nengineering courses, compared with just over 2%  in  the  UK,\r\n\r\n[ie,  two and a half times on a cohort comparison basis  with\r\n\r\nthe  UK.]   In addition, large numbers graduate from  diploma\r\n\r\ncourses  in  engineering  -  twice  as  many  as  achieve  an\r\n\r\nHDN/HNC*   certificate  in  engineering  in  the  UK   (whose\r\n\r\npopulation is around 20 times greater).'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the strong foundation that our Singapore children\r\n\r\nhave  acquired from the hard work that they have  put  in  at\r\n\r\nschool  carries them through college, and into their careers.\r\n\r\nMany  of  their counterparts in the UK and the US  would  not\r\n\r\neven  be at the start line in college, because not enough  of\r\n\r\nthem  had that kind of preparation in school.  Even  in  non-engineering  and  scientific courses, a  strong  quantitative\r\n\r\nfoundation gives our students an advantage in areas  such  as\r\n\r\naccounting, financial engineering,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  information  processing, and logistics  management.\r\n\r\nOur students gain a long term, perhaps a life-long, advantage\r\n\r\nover  their  counterparts in other countries who are  not  as\r\n\r\nwell  prepared.   This solid foundation could  be  even  more\r\n\r\ntelling  in  future, as a good foundation in mathematics  and\r\n\r\nthe  sciences  makes it much more easy for  a  person  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained and retrained in continuing education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang is therefore wrong to conclude that our\r\n\r\nstudents  do  not  have to study so hard in  school.   It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  because our students are well prepared in  school,\r\n\r\nboth  academically and in terms of their values and attitudes\r\n\r\nto  learning,  that  so  many  of  them  do  well  in  higher\r\n\r\neducation.   The  strong  work  ethic  and  values  that  our\r\n\r\nchildren imbibe give them an edge over others, and will  help\r\n\r\nthem to succeed in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, we have been putting in\r\n\r\nplace  programmes  and systems so that all  our  schools  are\r\n\r\nequipped   to   prepare   our  children   for   the   future.\r\n\r\nEnhancements  continue  to be made to school  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nschool management, and curriculum and assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our $2 billion IT master plan is now into its third and\r\n\r\nfinal  phase of implementation.  All teachers are trained  in\r\n\r\nIT  and we are already starting to look at the next step,  to\r\n\r\nlook beyond, to see where we want to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $4.5 billion Programme for Rebuilding and Improving\r\n\r\nExisting Schools (PRIME) is in its second phase.  By the  end\r\n\r\nof  next  year,  46%  of  all schools  would  have  undergone\r\n\r\nredevelopment  under PRIME.  These investments make  possible\r\n\r\neffective new combinations of people and technology to  raise\r\n\r\nstandards and extend learning opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of IT, the Ministry of Education develops\r\n\r\nand  provides  a  wide range of learning resources.   Mr  Low\r\n\r\nasked about what we are doing for the Chinese language.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduced  14  CD-ROMs,  21 audio CDs and  77  video  CDs,  to\r\n\r\nsupport  schools  in  the  use of  IT  for  teaching  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.   The Ministry has also developed a website  called\r\n\r\n\"Happy  Town\" to support the learning of Chinese language  at\r\n\r\nthe  upper primary level.  And the Ministry will continue  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and source for suitable materials to support the  use\r\n\r\nof IT in our schools, not just in Chinese language but in all\r\n\r\nsubject areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan asked the Ministry to improve the\r\n\r\nstanding  and  image of neighbourhood schools.  To  encourage\r\n\r\nand nurture more good schools, the Ministry of Education has,\r\n\r\nover  the years, steadily given more autonomy to schools,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can be more innovative and responsive to the needs\r\n\r\nof  pupils.   In  1994, autonomous schools  were  introduced.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  two more schools  - Xinmin and Dunman   -   have\r\n\r\nbeen accorded autonomous status, bringing the total number to\r\n\r\n20.   The Ministry intends to double the number of autonomous\r\n\r\nschools  to provide pupils and parents a wider range of  good\r\n\r\nschools.   We have also fully implemented the School  Cluster\r\n\r\nScheme,  which facilitates the sharing of resources and  best\r\n\r\npractices among schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to these measures, good schools are not limited\r\n\r\nto  brand  name  schools.   We have many  good  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools that add value to their students, so that they do  as\r\n\r\nwell  or  better than students who had scored better  in  the\r\n\r\nPSLE,  carry  themselves with confidence and are well-rounded\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Our neighbourhood schools have been doing  well\r\n\r\nin  both academic and non-academic areas.  Could I ask for  a\r\n\r\ntable  to  be distributed to hon. Members on value  added  of\r\n\r\nsome  of  our schools?  [Table distributed to hon.  Members.]\r\n\r\nOf  the schools that have received the value-added award  for\r\n\r\nacademic  performance  each year, about  75%  are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  schools.  That means they  do  very  well  for\r\n\r\ntheir  students.  Neighbourhood schools like  Rulang  Primary\r\n\r\nand  Jurong Primary are known for their IT programmes;  Radin\r\n\r\nMas Primary for its Digital Art programme; and Greenridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary  for its band.  Five years ago, few would have  heard\r\n\r\nof Xinmin, a neighbourhood school in Upper Serangoon.  Today,\r\n\r\nit  is a popular autonomous school known for many innovations\r\n\r\nand good quality of education.  It is also one of our top  50\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have done much to raise public\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the positive developments in our neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools  through both print and broadcast media.  One example\r\n\r\nis  the  Ministry of Education's television series  \"Learning\r\n\r\nJourneys\"  aired last year.  Schools on their  own  are  also\r\n\r\nencouraged  to actively publicise themselves.  With  a  wider\r\n\r\nrange  of schools distinguishing themselves in various areas,\r\n\r\nwe  hope that discerning parents and students will be able to\r\n\r\nselect schools that best suit their educational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked whether we could have private\r\n\r\nschools.   Although  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  given\r\n\r\nschools more autonomy and flexibility, the Government has  no\r\n\r\nplans to privatise existing national schools.  Already, about\r\n\r\none  quarter  of  all  our  schools are  Government-aided  or\r\n\r\nindependent.    The  guiding  principles  for  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  reflect the fundamental organising  principles  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean   society,   such  as   equal   opportunity   and\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.   Our  schools  provide  a  common   educational\r\n\r\nexperience  to  build national identity and social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nAny child regardless of his socio-economic background can  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to any secondary school based solely on merit,  and\r\n\r\nhe  need  not worry about the fees.  Allowing schools  to  go\r\n\r\nprivate  will introduce the potential for creating a division\r\n\r\nwithin  our school system where admission is based on ability\r\n\r\nto  pay rather than merit.  And this has potentially divisive\r\n\r\neffects on our society, which I would be reluctant to  embark\r\n\r\nupon any time soon or in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from good school management and infrastructure,\r\n\r\nour  students  are receiving a holistic education  through  a\r\n\r\nwell-rounded  curriculum  that  is  regularly  reviewed   and\r\n\r\nupdated.   I  informed this House two years ago that  we  are\r\n\r\nreducing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontent  by  30%  and  we  have  done  so.   Changes  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  system in the year  2003,  which  will\r\n\r\ninclude  bonus  points for CCA, and this will  reinforce  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of other measures of ability.  Furthermore,  this\r\n\r\nyear,  we will be introducing Edusave Awards for Sports,  the\r\n\r\nArts, community service and uniformed groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue to introduce changes that focus on the\r\n\r\nholistic  development of our young people, bilingualism  will\r\n\r\nremain a cornerstone of our education system.  Our young need\r\n\r\nto   learn  English  to  prepare  them  for  the  globalised,\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  world.   But,  while  the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  are competent users of English, I cannot but  agree\r\n\r\nwith Mr Peh that we should strive for a better standard,  and\r\n\r\nwe   are  doing  so.   Since  last  year,  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  revised  English language syllabuses  which  give\r\n\r\nrenewed attention to grammar to help our students become more\r\n\r\neffective  users of the language.  Many schools have  reading\r\n\r\nand  public  speaking  programmes to promote  confidence  and\r\n\r\nbetter usage of the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with the mother tongue language issues\r\n\r\nlater  in the session if I have the time.  I would just  like\r\n\r\nto conclude here by saying that our education system provides\r\n\r\nopportunities  for educational advancement  to  all  students\r\n\r\naccording  to their aptitudes and abilities.  The changes  in\r\n\r\nour  school  system,  the programmes and structures  move  us\r\n\r\ncloser   to  providing  an  ability-based  education  system.\r\n\r\nStudents  in  our national schools can benefit  from  a  high\r\n\r\nquality of education, so that the vast majority of our people\r\n\r\ncan stay on the correct side of the global knowledge divide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that several Members have raised the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  teachers.   This is perhaps  the  most  critical\r\n\r\nelement in a good education system, and I will speak on  this\r\n\r\na little later today, because I see that several Members will\r\n\r\nalso  want  to  speak on this subject, and I will  come  back\r\n\r\nagain when I have heard their suggestions and views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, we have used a lot of money on\r\n\r\nIT for schools.

In particular, I  would  like\r\n\r\nto  know  how  the application of IT has enhanced  and  added\r\n\r\nvalue  to  the quality of teaching.  Secondly, how  does  the\r\n\r\napplication of IT in teaching of language help students learn\r\n\r\nthe language?  Was there any study done as to how application\r\n\r\nof  IT  in  the teaching of language can achieve  a  specific\r\n\r\nteaching objective?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the use of IT in education is\r\n\r\na  relatively new area and there are not very many definitive\r\n\r\nstudies that have been done on the effects of the use  of  IT\r\n\r\nin education.  But we do know that, for example, if you go to\r\n\r\na  language laboratory and you use headphones and  listen  to\r\n\r\ntapes, and if you watch Chinese movies, it is likely that you\r\n\r\nwill gain some benefit.  And if you get the vocabulary, it is\r\n\r\nmore  interesting and you will be learning something, and  it\r\n\r\nprobably helps to improve your language ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we are also trying with the use of IT for\r\n\r\nmother tongue learning.  I believe that the students who  are\r\n\r\nusing it will probably find it more interesting.  They have a\r\n\r\nwider  range  of resources available.  And if they  can  read\r\n\r\nbooks  which  are  animated, I think it is all  very  useful.\r\n\r\nEven  looking up the dictionary is a pleasure today  compared\r\n\r\nto looking up a dictionary which is non-IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Thank you, Sir, for permitting me to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister.  When I say that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  any long-term advantage, that a university  degree\r\n\r\nholder,  say,  from  a USA university,  with  a  Bachelor  of\r\n\r\nScience,  and  another student graduating  from  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nuniversity  in  the same area and domain, they probably  have\r\n\r\nthe same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontent  and knowledge at that level.  That is what  I  meant\r\n\r\nwhen I say an individual from the Singapore system, after  he\r\n\r\ngraduated  from  a four-year degree programme,  compared  to,\r\n\r\nsay,  a  US  graduate in the same discipline, the  amount  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  they have is probably  the  same.   In  that\r\n\r\nsense, we do not have a long-term advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I do not think the Minister has addressed\r\n\r\nmy  point  that  we  actually learn a lot  in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem, but in terms of utilisation and creativity, we are no\r\n\r\nbetter off than a graduate from, say, a USA university.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  area  that  Mr Inderjit Singh has in  fact  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I would like to address Dr\r\n\r\nWang's  points  on two levels.  One at the individual  level;\r\n\r\nand the other at the society level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, I have already put up the\r\n\r\nstatistics to show that many more of our students get to  the\r\n\r\nstart  line.   When  they get to the finishing  line  at  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  and they take a course in Science or  Engineering\r\n\r\nin  the United States, or they take Science or Engineering in\r\n\r\nNUS  or  NTU, they may be comparable.  But a very much higher\r\n\r\nproportion of our students get to the start line and actually\r\n\r\nget through, 21/2 times more than in the United Kingdom.   So\r\n\r\nat  the  individual level, our students have 21/2 times  more\r\n\r\nopportunity  to get through the system and come  out  with  a\r\n\r\nScience  or  Engineering degree than a  student  in  the  UK,\r\n\r\nbecause of the strong preparation that they have in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the society or country level, you can see that a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  these  countries are lamenting  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nengineers and scientists to support the economy.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nshortage  too,  but for different reasons - we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nenough  people.  But a large proportion of our  students  are\r\n\r\ngoing  through  such  programmes and  they  are  getting  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of these programmes.  So at the society level, on the\r\n\r\nwhole people level, we are also doing better and not just at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe individual level.

The graded project work which students now have to\r\n\r\ndo, which teachers have to supervise, is one such example.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that many of our students have been very busy  over\r\n\r\nthis  vacation doing some project work or other.  So this  is\r\n\r\none  example of some of the changes that are taking place  in\r\n\r\nour education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify one\r\n\r\npoint on the streaming issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point was: do we really have to stream our children\r\n\r\nat  such an early age at Primary 4?  We can still achieve the\r\n\r\nsame desired objective of having our children go into ITE  or\r\n\r\npolytechnics  at secondary school level if we  use  the  PSLE\r\n\r\nresults to do the streaming by having various grades for them\r\n\r\nto  go  into various streams.  Streaming at Primary  4  level\r\n\r\ncreates  unnecessary stress at such an early  age,  and  this\r\n\r\nwill  basically develop an attitude among children where they\r\n\r\nwill not enjoy going to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue the Minister mentioned was that parents\r\n\r\nhave  a  choice  on streaming at EM1, EM2 or EM3  level.   In\r\n\r\npractice, schools really do not allow much choice to parents.\r\n\r\nParents  are told that this is where they have to go  on  the\r\n\r\nground.   While the desired objective is to let our  children\r\n\r\nlearn  at their own pace, in implementation, I think teachers\r\n\r\ndread  taking an EM3 student, when they should actually enjoy\r\n\r\ntaking  this  EM3  student and make him or her  into  an  EM1\r\n\r\nstudent   through   the   process.    But,   I   think,    in\r\n\r\nimplementation,  we are spending a lot of time  grooming  our\r\n\r\nEM1  children  to  be among the best and  maybe  not  putting\r\n\r\nenough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffort to improve those who are in the lower streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I wish Mr Inderjit Singh were\r\n\r\nright, that every EM3 student could be converted into an  EM1\r\n\r\nstudent.  I wish that he was right.  I wish that he was right\r\n\r\nthat  just  by putting in effort, we could do that  also.   I\r\n\r\nhave  the same desires as he has.  His heart is in the  right\r\n\r\nplace.   But  we  have  to face the reality  -  children  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  We have to give them a curriculum which they  can\r\n\r\ncope  with.  The reason that we have an EM3 stream is because\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  children are unable to cope with  Mathematics,\r\n\r\nScience and language, which are going on both in the EM1  and\r\n\r\nEM2  streams.   If  they are not able to cope  and  they  are\r\n\r\noverloaded, they end up not learning anything in Primary 4, 5\r\n\r\nand  6, because the load is just too heavy, and they have  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  reduced curriculum.  They face the same  examination\r\n\r\npaper,  and  they are totally disheartened because  they  can\r\n\r\nmake no headway with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that being fairer to them than providing them with a\r\n\r\ncurriculum  which  they  can  handle,  which  they   can   do\r\n\r\nreasonably well in, and progress on to secondary schools?  In\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, if they do well, as I have indicated  just\r\n\r\nnow  with the figures, they can move on.  If they do well  in\r\n\r\nITE,  they  can move on too to the polytechnic.  If  they  do\r\n\r\nwell  in the polytechnic, they can move on to the university.\r\n\r\nThe  doors are not closed.  I am not saying that it is  easy,\r\n\r\nbut the doors are not closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has to ask himself whether he really\r\n\r\nfeels  that  it  is fairer to the students if  we  push  them\r\n\r\nthrough  a  uniform programme which they are unable  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  or we try and tailor programmes which the children  are\r\n\r\nable to cope with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I agree with that.

It is not\r\n\r\neasy  these days having to deal with a class of children  who\r\n\r\nare  getting  more difficult to control and  discipline,  let\r\n\r\nalone other administrative duties.  Should we not have a two-teacher  position in certain difficult classes  to  make  the\r\n\r\nwork of our teachers more manageable and productive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are professionals. We should accord the\r\n\r\nrespect  and  status  to the teachers in  our  society.   Our\r\n\r\nteachers  are well trained and fully competent to  teach  our\r\n\r\nchildren.   I just wonder whether our parents show  the  same\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the teachers who are helping their children  in\r\n\r\nschool.   Sometimes we hear of parents who  think  that  they\r\n\r\nknow  better  than  the  teachers  and  interfere  with   the\r\n\r\nteacher's relationship with their children in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides academic qualifications, teachers require\r\n\r\nspecial  attributes.   They must  love  children.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nvocation.   In  the  teacher's hands  lie  the  future  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry, a generation of leaders to be educated and nurtured,\r\n\r\nand a successful individual who makes the work of the teacher\r\n\r\nworthwhile and rewarding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, to attract individuals to take up the teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  is  in itself a long process.  For  a  start,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  sad if the vast majority of children  of  teachers\r\n\r\nbecome  averse  to teaching and not follow the  footsteps  of\r\n\r\ntheir  parents.  Students should be inspired, when young,  to\r\n\r\nbecome  teachers.   They  should be  given  encouragement  to\r\n\r\nbecome  one.   Teaching  is  the sharing  of  knowledge.   In\r\n\r\nschool,  our  children should be encouraged  to  share  their\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  teach  their weaker  classmates.   We  should\r\n\r\nactively inculcate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  attitude of sharing and for the better students to help\r\n\r\ntheir   weaker  classmates  in  understanding  the   lessons.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  must  have the sense of mission  in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nteach,  otherwise they would not persevere and not last  very\r\n\r\nlong  in  the teaching profession.  I therefore salute  those\r\n\r\nteachers who have stayed until their retirement and for  some\r\n\r\nwho continue even after retirement in different capacities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether the Ministry is\r\n\r\nrecruiting  the  right people to become teachers?   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry  has,  over  the  years,  varied   the\r\n\r\nselection  criteria for those who applied to become teachers.\r\n\r\nIs  it  time for a review?  We need to give every support  to\r\n\r\nour  teachers, to encourage them to continue in their service\r\n\r\nfor as long as possible and make valuable contribution to our\r\n\r\nyoung for the future of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister the state of the teaching\r\n\r\nservice.   Is he happy with the number of teachers  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  recruited?   How could we improve  and  strengthen  the\r\n\r\noverall experience and competency level of our teachers?  How\r\n\r\ndo we encourage as many of them to develop teaching as a long\r\n\r\nterm career?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, let me quote the British\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Union leader when he talked about the shortage  of\r\n\r\nteachers  in UK recently: \"The British government before  the\r\n\r\nlast  election made a famous war cry, `Education,  education,\r\n\r\neducation.'   But they should have been thinking:  `Teachers,\r\n\r\nteachers,  teachers'.\"  And I would also like to quote  Kevin\r\n\r\nSpacey,  actor of a teacher in the movie \"Pay It Forward\",  a\r\n\r\nvery   inspirational  movie  about  the  interaction  between\r\n\r\nteachers and students: \"It is important that someone suggests\r\n\r\na  way  of  opening  up  your mind.   Great  teaching  is  an\r\n\r\nincredible art.  It is not easy at all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the men and women, who teach our children, hold the\r\n\r\nkey  to opening up the mind of children.  The speakers before\r\n\r\nme  have  already touched on this point.  On their  shoulders\r\n\r\nare placed a heavy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  transmitting  knowledge  and  inculcating\r\n\r\nvalues,  and only the committed and dedicated will take  this\r\n\r\non  as  a  lifelong  vocation.  Like many  countries  with  a\r\n\r\nvibrant economy, it is very difficult to find qualified young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  choose teaching as their  lifelong  career.\r\n\r\nMOE currently looks for future teachers among the top 30%  of\r\n\r\neach  cohort.  This effectively limits the pool of candidates\r\n\r\nfor  the teacher training to the university.  Given the  pool\r\n\r\nof  other  sectors  of  the economy, we are  just  recruiting\r\n\r\nenough  new  teachers  to  fill the  vacancy  resulting  from\r\n\r\nretirement and attrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran has already spoken on the need to address the\r\n\r\nissue  of  making  teaching an interesting  career  from  two\r\n\r\naspects, namely, compensation and benefits, and also  equally\r\n\r\nimportant,  the  continuing development  of  teachers  during\r\n\r\ntheir career lifetime.  On this topic, since the Minister has\r\n\r\nalready  mentioned that in this year's Budget,  it  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  a  higher budget allocation, would he review  how  the\r\n\r\nMinistry can make teaching a more challenging and interesting\r\n\r\ncareer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  figures  released  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, during the last five years, that is, from 1995  to\r\n\r\nthe  year  2000, approximately 80 Chinese teachers  from  the\r\n\r\nprimary  and  secondary  schools  and  junior  colleges   had\r\n\r\nresigned.   It  was just about 2.4% of the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nChinese teachers, and the number is negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time, about 230 Chinese teachers\r\n\r\nretired from the service.  In other words, every year we need\r\n\r\nto  recruit  300 Chinese teachers.  I do not  know  how  many\r\n\r\nChinese  teachers are being nurtured by the  NIE  each  year.\r\n\r\nBut  from  the fact that the MOE had been recruiting  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  from China every year for the past three years,  it\r\n\r\nis quite obvious that the local supply is inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, we engaged 33, and another 62 in 1999. During\r\n\r\nthe first 10 months of last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear, 81 came.  Appropriately, importing foreign talent is  a\r\n\r\ngood thing. But it must be based on some good plan to attract\r\n\r\nand  recruit,  and not as a stop-gap measure.  Otherwise,  it\r\n\r\nwill lead to many sequelae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that there is yet another batch of Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers coming from China.  It is quite obvious that we  are\r\n\r\ngetting  more  and more Chinese teachers from China.   It  is\r\n\r\ngood  that  we recruit talented Chinese teachers from  China.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we should treat them well, with proper respect  and\r\n\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are unlike the other professions. In the Tang\r\n\r\nDynasty,  there  was a great scholar, Han Yu,  who  said:  \"A\r\n\r\nteacher  is one who preaches the doctrine, imparts  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  clears  your doubts.\"  In other words,  teachers  are  a\r\n\r\nspecial breed of people who could teach us and would leave  a\r\n\r\nvery  long lasting impression on their students.  It  may  be\r\n\r\ndifficult   for  teachers,  who  are  engaged  on  short-term\r\n\r\ncontracts  and  who  come  and go,  to  take  on  this  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have a very complete solution to resolve this\r\n\r\nproblem of shortage in Chinese teachers.  This solution would\r\n\r\ninclude expanding the talent pool of Chinese scholars; review\r\n\r\nthe workload of the Chinese teachers and improve their career\r\n\r\nprospects.  As for the foreign teachers, we should also  have\r\n\r\nsome long-term arrangements to enable them to gradually adapt\r\n\r\nto  the  local situation and cultivate in them the  necessary\r\n\r\nsense  of  belonging.   We could let them integrate into  our\r\n\r\nsociety and develop a sense of belonging here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of talent pool of Chinese scholars would\r\n\r\ninvolve the issue of eligibility of students to study \"Higher\r\n\r\nChinese\".   According to the feedback from some  parents  and\r\n\r\nsecondary school teachers, if a student does not score an  A*\r\n\r\nin Chinese or a Distinction in Higher Chinese at the PSLE, he\r\n\r\nwould not be allowed to take Higher Chinese in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondary  school. He would also need to  score  an   \"A\"  in\r\n\r\nEnglish in the PSLE before he is allowed to do Higher Chinese\r\n\r\nin the secondary school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, we can see that the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nimposed  a lot of restrictions on the student's intention  to\r\n\r\ndo  Higher Chinese.  MOE's intention is that the student must\r\n\r\nmanage  his English and other subjects well.  This is  beyond\r\n\r\nreproach.  However,  by so doing, it is  certainly  going  to\r\n\r\ndeprive  some  students of the opportunity  to  study  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese, and is tantamount to reducing the source of  Chinese\r\n\r\ntalents who can be groomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that such a restriction imposed on the student's\r\n\r\neligibility to do Higher Chinese needs to be reviewed.  Faced\r\n\r\nwith  the  withering  number  of Chinese  talents,  including\r\n\r\nChinese  teachers,  and coupled with the picking  up  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  our  Asian neighbour, China, we should  promptly\r\n\r\nchange  this  practice, and actively nurture a batch  of  new\r\n\r\nChinese  talents as successors to satisfy the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational situation in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I feel that the present stringent requirements\r\n\r\nshould  at least be relaxed to allow more students to have  a\r\n\r\nchance of studying Higher Chinese  in the secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I am encouraged\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister's assurance that securing quality  teaching\r\n\r\nresources is one of his top priorities.

Many  regret the lack  of  opportunity  or  the\r\n\r\ninability to inculcate values in students.  The role  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers has also evolved into more of a facilitator than  an\r\n\r\ninstructor  per  se.  Also the perception that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nolder  ones can retire whenever they would like to  does  not\r\n\r\nmake  for good morale.  Sir, these teachers have been pillars\r\n\r\nand  have  painstakingly instilled values alongside  lessons.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be  a shame to have to lose their passion  because\r\n\r\nthey feel overwhelmed, or even defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the more tech-savvy younger teachers\r\n\r\nfrequently  find coping with parents, defiant  students,  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  load or even a promotion difficult  to  bear.\r\n\r\nThey, too, find their flames waning early into their teaching\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I understand that the school and even\r\n\r\ncluster leadership is well-placed to counsel teachers who may\r\n\r\nfeel  a  little overwhelmed, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  setting  up an avenue outside  of  this  formal\r\n\r\nstructure to complement this support.  For example, a pool of\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers or principals at headquarters itself can\r\n\r\nbe  made  available  to guide and mentor  young  teachers  on\r\n\r\nhandling  stress  and  the more experienced  on  coping  with\r\n\r\nchanges.  Other possibilities can include peer-support groups\r\n\r\nfor teachers to share common problems and solutions, all done\r\n\r\nin such a way as not to undermine the leadership in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be a sad day if we lose teachers with\r\n\r\npassion to stress and the inability to cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as a member\r\n\r\nof  COMPASS  as  well as a parent, I have the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nvisit  many schools and have also seen teachers who teach  my\r\n\r\nchildren.

The recent salary  revision  to\r\n\r\nteachers  was  a  right  step in trying  to  remunerate  them\r\n\r\nfairly.  However, even with salary revisions, I see that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry has not been able to meet recruitment targets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, the shortfall in teaching was about 6,300\r\n\r\nteachers.  Last year, the shortfall, according to the Budget,\r\n\r\nis  about  4,600 teachers.  Although there is an improvement,\r\n\r\nthere  is  still  a  shortfall.  The shortfall  seems  to  be\r\n\r\naggravated  by  two other factors.  One  is  that  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nexperienced  teachers seem to be retiring  in  the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears.   Another  one is that the teaching service  does  not\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  able to get enough males to join  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice.   When  you  go round, you see  more  females.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:   are there adequate male role  models  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching service and what is its impact on our children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I spoke to the teachers, I asked them, \"Well, the\r\n\r\nteaching  profession is well paid, why aren't people  joining\r\n\r\nin?\"   The  feedback I got is, \"The workload  is  heavy,  the\r\n\r\nstress  is  high.\"   Then I told them,  \"But  I  thought  the\r\n\r\nteaching   service  has  now  got  administrators,  operation\r\n\r\nmanagers in schools to help you cope with this workload.\"   I\r\n\r\nwas  told  that these are just layers in the hierarchy  which\r\n\r\nactually  generate even more work.  So I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nit is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is I also notice that, in this year's\r\n\r\nbudget,  the  manpower numbers for the teaching service  have\r\n\r\nbeen reduced by 500 places for the next financial year.   Why\r\n\r\nis  the number in the teaching service reduced, ie, why do we\r\n\r\nneed  less teachers?  And what steps are we taking to recruit\r\n\r\nmore  teachers  to  meet  the  shortfall?   In  addition   to\r\n\r\nimproving  pay,  developing teachers through education,  etc,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  we  doing  to  enhance the working  conditions  of\r\n\r\nteachers?  The next point is that some time ago, there was an\r\n\r\nannouncement about getting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  who are already working and have made career  changes\r\n\r\ninto the teaching profession.  What progress have we made  in\r\n\r\ngetting  people  from  other professions  to  move  into  the\r\n\r\nteaching service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  agree with Mr Low Thia Khiang's objection to the use  of\r\n\r\nIT  in  teaching.   No  doubt, the  high-tech  method  cannot\r\n\r\nreplace  the  conventional method  in  the  teaching  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents, but it does help to raise the standard of teaching.\r\n\r\nOur  Chinese  teachers in Singapore have, over the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears,  developed  some fantastic softwares for the  teaching\r\n\r\nof  Chinese, based on our Singapore context,  and the results\r\n\r\nare   very  remarkable indeed.  Maybe Mr Low is not aware  of\r\n\r\nthese  softwares,  some  of  which are  multimedia  software.\r\n\r\nThese softwares have raised the interest of the pupils in the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  the language.  I recommend that Mr  Low  pay  a\r\n\r\nvisit to  some of the schools, eg, Raffles Girls' School,  to\r\n\r\nobserve how these softwares are being used in the teaching of\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, the Ministry of Education has\r\n\r\nmade  great  efforts in the past few years and  has  achieved\r\n\r\nremarkable results. This is particularly in the provision  of\r\n\r\nschool buildings and the various educational facilities.  The\r\n\r\nachievement  is  clearly there for all  to  see.   While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  invested  a lot in infrastructure,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nhardware  part  of it, we must also strengthen  our  software\r\n\r\naspect, ie, the upgrading of our teachers and do our best  to\r\n\r\nensure that we have enough teachers in Singapore,  especially\r\n\r\nlanguage  teachers.  It is only with enough language teachers\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to effectively implement our bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the median age of our teachers in the various\r\n\r\nstages of education is an important data that we should  take\r\n\r\nnotice.   This  data  will  help us  to  plan  our  need  for\r\n\r\nteachers,  so that they may not be a phenomenon of  \"the  new\r\n\r\ncrop  still in the blade and the old ones all consumed\".    I\r\n\r\nremember  that five years ago, the median age of our  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  in the primary schools was 47 years old.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  many  Chinese  teachers in the primary  schools  were\r\n\r\nolder than 47\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  old.  I would like to know what is the median  age  of\r\n\r\nthe  primary school Chinese teachers now.  I would also  like\r\n\r\nto  know whether there is any plan on the part of MOE to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  we  have enough Chinese teachers in  the  various\r\n\r\nstages  of  our  education system to take  on  the  important\r\n\r\nresponsibility of teaching the mother tongue language. I know\r\n\r\nthat  apart  from actively cultivating some  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbecome  Chinese  teachers,  MOE  is  also  importing  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  from other countries to help alleviate the  problem\r\n\r\nof  shortages  in the supply of local Chinese teachers.    As\r\n\r\nmentioned  by Mr Goh Choon Kang just now, we have imported  a\r\n\r\nlot of Chinese teachers from China.  I would like to know how\r\n\r\nmany foreign Chinese teachers are there now in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a necessity for us to attract more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to become Chinese teachers, to retain  all  the\r\n\r\nexisting   teachers  and  to  help  them  to  upgrade   their\r\n\r\nprofessional level.  We should take some measures  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  administrative burden of the teachers so that  they  can\r\n\r\nconcentrate on teaching.  I am very glad that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation had introduced the Mother Tongue Language Teachers'\r\n\r\nAward  last year.  I would like to ask the Minister how  many\r\n\r\nteachers  have  benefited from this  Mother  Tongue  Language\r\n\r\nTeachers' Award and whether there are any incentives  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education to encourage our mother tongue teachers\r\n\r\nto  further  their  studies  and upgrade  their  professional\r\n\r\nlevel.  At the same time, we should also encourage them to be\r\n\r\nreleased  from  their  heavy  teaching  commitments   at   an\r\n\r\nappropriate  time to go for further studies  on  a  full-time\r\n\r\nbasis to \"charge up their batteries\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Singapore Chinese Teachers Union (SCTU)\r\n\r\nis   the  only  trade  union  representing  all  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers.  I hope that the Ministry of Education will enhance\r\n\r\nits  links  with the SCTU and to improve the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  through  a tripartite effort to nurture  more  high\r\n\r\nquality professionals in the teaching of Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the issue of class size is one\r\n\r\nof  efficient or quality teaching.  Can a teacher  give  more\r\n\r\nefficient  teaching  if  the class size  is  large,  say,  50\r\n\r\npupils,  or  when a class size is small, say, 20  pupils?   I\r\n\r\nthink most people would agree that when a class is smaller in\r\n\r\nsize,  more  efficient or effective teaching can  be  carried\r\n\r\nout.   The  reason is simple.  For a smaller class size,  the\r\n\r\nteacher  can  give  more  personal attention  to  the  slower\r\n\r\nlearners, and it is also easier to control the class  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  pupils  to  pay  attention to the  teacher  when  he  is\r\n\r\nteaching.   There  is  also  less  stress  on  the  teachers.\r\n\r\nFeedback, from readers in the Forum page of the Straits Times\r\n\r\nrecently, favours smaller classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua cited problems of the inability of\r\n\r\npupils,  after passing out from secondary schools,  to  write\r\n\r\neven a proper essay or an application letter and, in the case\r\n\r\nof  Dr  Lily  Neo, she says that there is too  much  tuition.\r\n\r\nThese  problems, I believe, arise because our teachers cannot\r\n\r\ngive effective teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our class size is too large. The issue of a smaller\r\n\r\nclass size is not a new one.  I have brought this topic up in\r\n\r\nalmost every Budget, in the Committee of Supply.  Most of our\r\n\r\nschools now have a class size of about 40 pupils.  I had been\r\n\r\na  school teacher myself, Sir, and I can tell you that it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to teach a class of 40 pupils.  I have  suggested,\r\n\r\nand I would suggest again, that we reduce our class size to a\r\n\r\ncompromise  number of 30 pupils.  I say \"compromise\"  because\r\n\r\n30 to a class is still too large.  The ideal, of course, is a\r\n\r\nclass  size  as small as possible.  The ideal, of course,  is\r\n\r\n1:1,  but that is too idealistic.  I would suggest, if it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  to bring down our class size to about  30  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  as  a  compromise.  But, the class size,  as  I  was\r\n\r\nsaying,  we should get it down to as small as possible,  say,\r\n\r\n10-15  per  class.  However, from the point of  view  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry's resources, it may be difficult to get a class  down\r\n\r\nto 10 or 15 pupils.  I think it is a luxury at the moment, if\r\n\r\nwe  did  that.   I  would  say  that  we  can  make  a  great\r\n\r\nimprovement from a class of 40 to a class of 30, and it would\r\n\r\nbe a great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleap forward for our education system if we achieve that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that when we reduce the class size, there\r\n\r\nis  a  problem of shortage of teachers.  I would say that  we\r\n\r\nneed  not all at once convert our school system suddenly from\r\n\r\n40  to  30  in a class.  The 1/4 reduction shall, of  course,\r\n\r\nneed   25%  more  teachers.   I  have  been  informed   that,\r\n\r\ncurrently, our teaching strength is about 23,000, which would\r\n\r\nmean  that  if  we  reduce our class size by  1/4,  we  would\r\n\r\nrequire about 5,700 more teachers, which is really a very big\r\n\r\nnumber.   To solve the teacher shortage, I would say that  we\r\n\r\nslowly  reduce the class size and build more schools  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, say, over a period of 10 years building programme.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am not advocating that we make a sudden or overnight\r\n\r\nchange.   As long as there is a commitment for change,  I  am\r\n\r\nvery happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem cited, Sir, is that when we recruit more\r\n\r\nteachers,  the  standard  of the teachers  will  drop.   This\r\n\r\nproblem  can  be solved by good teacher training  programmes,\r\n\r\ntogether with good pay and incentives to recruit good  people\r\n\r\nto  the  teaching profession.  Of course, the quality of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  recruited must be good.  But I think also that  the\r\n\r\nlove for teaching is equally important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this year the Minister shall be more amenable to\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion.  Perhaps he may even do an experiment and try\r\n\r\ntwo  schools  first  to see whether it is successful  with  a\r\n\r\nsmaller class size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, my question to the Minister is: how\r\n\r\nmuch  of  a difference can a smaller class size make  to  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  education our children receive?   It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of whether a smaller class size makes a difference  - because, I think, as Mr Chiam has said, and I think that is a\r\n\r\nfairly simplistic argument to say, a smaller class size will,\r\n\r\nof  its  own accord, make a difference - the question is,  in\r\n\r\nthe  scheme of things relative to the other factors, how much\r\n\r\nof  a  difference  can it make?  Intuitively,  parents  would\r\n\r\nargue that a smaller class size is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  when  it comes to the allocation of hundreds of millions\r\n\r\nof dollars, clearly we have to go beyond intuition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOE has said that class size is one of a slew of\r\n\r\nfactors  that  impact  on the quality of  education.   Others\r\n\r\ncited  include  motivation  of pupils,  teaching  strategies,\r\n\r\ndesign of curriculum and the like.  The question then is  one\r\n\r\nof  an  allocative decision.  The Government has  stated  its\r\n\r\ncommitment,  and I think the Minister has stated  this  again\r\n\r\ntoday,  that  it  is prepared to spend a considerably  larger\r\n\r\namount  of money on education.  Where should the next hundred\r\n\r\nmillion dollars in education go when we are talking about the\r\n\r\nschool  system  and  the education within  a  school  system?\r\n\r\nShould  it  go  towards more IT?  Should it go  towards  more\r\n\r\nteaching  strategy  development and  curriculum  development?\r\n\r\nShould  it go towards reducing class size?  That is  where  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  relative  importance  of  these  factors  becomes\r\n\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has cited the fact that, if we try and\r\n\r\nlower  class size abruptly, the quality of our teachers  will\r\n\r\nfall,  and  that  will have an adverse effect.   Nobody  will\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  that argument, and nobody  is  asking  for  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  or  precipitous change.  But the question  is:  is\r\n\r\nthere a long-term target that the Ministry is working towards\r\n\r\nin  reducing the size of our classes?  The problem of quality\r\n\r\nof teachers will have a gradual correction of its own accord.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Minister himself has said, each cohort is  attaining\r\n\r\nhigher levels of education.  So, presumably, we can gradually\r\n\r\nincrease the pool we recruit from within Singapore to augment\r\n\r\nour  teaching  resources.  The other avenue,  of  course,  is\r\n\r\ntapping of foreign pool as well, for certain content areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction could also be phased in. If we do\r\n\r\nnot want a wholesale introduction of a smaller class size, we\r\n\r\ncould perhaps target it at specific areas, whether it is  at,\r\n\r\nsay,  early primary or even the primary level as a whole,  in\r\n\r\norder to ease transition into the school system, and in order\r\n\r\nto enhance the early primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  experience, and we can also target it  at  perhaps\r\n\r\ncertain  pedagogic groups, where highly interactive learning,\r\n\r\nwith  the  teacher  actively involved with the  students,  is\r\n\r\nnecessary and desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the establishment of a clear policy direction on\r\n\r\nwhere the class size should  be is an important signal to the\r\n\r\nprincipals  down the line, because the Ministry has  devolved\r\n\r\nconsiderable flexibility and responsibility to principals  on\r\n\r\nhow  they  manage  at the micro level the relative  sizes  of\r\n\r\ntheir  classes,  and  some  have  channelled  more  resources\r\n\r\ntowards  slow  learners  and so on.  But,  unless  the  macro\r\n\r\npicture is clearly defined, I think there would not be enough\r\n\r\nresources  for flexibility at the micro level.   So  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate  some  clarification  from  the  Minister  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's position on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, let me now deal with teachers,\r\n\r\nan  issue that my Ministry will be focusing on in the  school\r\n\r\nsector  this coming year.  Teachers lie at the heart  of  all\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  in  education, and we need good  teachers,  and\r\n\r\nenough  of them, to do all the things that we want to  do  in\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a rough picture of where the teaching force\r\n\r\nis  today.   We  have  about 25,000 teachers,  but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nteaching force which is roughly an M-shape by age.   We  have\r\n\r\nmany teachers who are in their 50s and older, who joined  the\r\n\r\nteaching   service  and  took  us  through  the  trials   and\r\n\r\ntribulations  of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, and produced  the\r\n\r\ngood  education  system that we have today.  So  they  really\r\n\r\nwere  the  ones  who  carried the load over  the  last  three\r\n\r\ndecades  of nation-building.  But many of them are coming  to\r\n\r\nretirement age.  I will lose 3,500 of them over the next five\r\n\r\nyears.  3,500 is enough to wipe out all the teachers in 10 of\r\n\r\nour constituencies completely.  It is about something like 50\r\n\r\nschools' worth of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we have been able to recruit new teachers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  over  the last 4-5 years, because  of  the  new\r\n\r\nteachers'  schemes  that  have  been  put  in  place  by   my\r\n\r\npredecessor, Mr Lee Yock Suan.  And, in the last  few  years,\r\n\r\nwe have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen able to recruit some 5,000 to 6,000 teachers.  So it  is\r\n\r\nan M-shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, the median age of teachers was 43. That\r\n\r\nmeans,  if  you open the staff room and you look inside,  the\r\n\r\nmedian  age of the teachers is 43 years old.  Today,  if  you\r\n\r\nopen  a  staff  room and you look inside, the median  age  of\r\n\r\nteachers is 38.  In five years' time, when you do that again,\r\n\r\nthe  median age of the teachers will be 33.  There is a  very\r\n\r\nbig  shift  going  on in the teaching service.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nmanage  this  change.   We see it now differentially  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   In  some of the schools that you go to,  half  the\r\n\r\nteachers  have less than five years of service,  some  higher\r\n\r\nthan  that - 60%-70%.  If you went to the same school 6 or  7\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  you  would probably find  that  70%-80%  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers had been there for 15, 20 or 30 years.  This is  the\r\n\r\nkind of change that is going on today in the system.  So,  it\r\n\r\nis  quite critical for us to be able to make sure that we can\r\n\r\nrecruit and retain enough teachers, so that many more of them\r\n\r\nwill  stay with us and become the new bedrock upon which  the\r\n\r\neducation  system is built, just like our loyal and dedicated\r\n\r\nteachers  who are in their 50s and over, who will be retiring\r\n\r\nover the next five to 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I do that, let me first discuss the issue of\r\n\r\npupil-teacher  ratios  and class  sizes  which  has  come  up\r\n\r\nregularly.   I  can almost predict what Mr  Chiam  will  say.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, pupil-teacher ratio and class sizes are not the\r\n\r\nsame thing.  Class size is a specific arrangement for putting\r\n\r\na  certain number of students in a specific way in  a  class,\r\n\r\nwhereas  pupil-teacher ratio is an indication of the teaching\r\n\r\nresources  that  we  have available, say,  for  a  particular\r\n\r\nschool, in relation to the number of students there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinking class sizes has an intuitive appeal. Fewer\r\n\r\nstudents mean more attention for each child.  Proponents  say\r\n\r\nthat  it will raise the quality of education, improve pupils'\r\n\r\nperformance, and reduce teacher workloads.  And the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education is in fact open to all ideas that  can  improve\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  education  that our  students  receive  and\r\n\r\nimprove the working conditions for teachers, including\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanging  class sizes and seeing what other methods  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  use to deal with some of the problems that teachers face\r\n\r\nin class, with either large marking loads or students who may\r\n\r\nneed extra attention and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are also mindful that the quality of\r\n\r\neducation is not determined by just a single factor.   It  is\r\n\r\nin  fact  multi-factorial.  The factors which  influence  the\r\n\r\nquality of education are not limited to class size, but  also\r\n\r\ninclude  curriculum, how it is delivered, school organisation\r\n\r\nand  tone.  And whether or not the students behave themselves\r\n\r\nin  a school or in a class has a lot of impact on whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  we can teach in a large class or teach in a small class.\r\n\r\nIf  we  have 10 students who are disruptive all the time,  we\r\n\r\nare not going to be able to get any teaching done.  But if we\r\n\r\nhave  40 students who are on-task and eager to learn, we  can\r\n\r\nget  quite  a lot of teaching done.  That makes a fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference.   Of course, home support and, finally  and  most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  teacher quality.  These factors  also  interact\r\n\r\nwith  one  another.  Good teachers are the key to  everything\r\n\r\nthat   we   do  because  education  is  a  completely   human\r\n\r\nenterprise.   It is about people for people, and  it  happens\r\n\r\nthrough people.  When you put the teacher in a classroom, she\r\n\r\nperforms,  and  how  she interacts with  students  determines\r\n\r\nwhether education actually takes place or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we lay out the systems and infrastructure\r\n\r\nnecessary for an ability-based education, we need good people\r\n\r\nto  deliver  this  education.  Ideally, we would  have  small\r\n\r\nclasses, every one of which would be taught by good teachers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the  proportion  of  good  teachers  in   the\r\n\r\nEducation  Service  and  class  size  is  probably  inversely\r\n\r\nrelated, especially when we look at the issue from the  scale\r\n\r\nof the entire education system, and not just one class or one\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country faces this problem. In the US and UK,\r\n\r\nwhere  class sizes are small, the big outcry is over  teacher\r\n\r\nquality.  In September 1998, the then US Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Richard Riley, pointed out that the  US  faced  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of high-quality teachers, with shortages developing\r\n\r\nin  specific fields of expertise, like Mathematics,  Science,\r\n\r\nspecial education and bilingual education.  He lamented:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Too many school districts are sacrificing quality for\r\n\r\nquantity to meet the immediate demand of putting a warm  body\r\n\r\nin  front  of a classroom. This is a mistake. Even  now,  too\r\n\r\nmany school districts are issuing emergency licences.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nEmergency  licences are issued to teachers who are not  fully\r\n\r\nqualified  to  teach.   School systems that  have  sought  to\r\n\r\nradically  reduce class size have found that it has  come  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of teacher quality because it forces schools  to\r\n\r\nhire  under  qualified teachers, or teachers whom they  would\r\n\r\nnot otherwise have hired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A January 2001 Education Week article says, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"California learnt their lesson first-hand when the\r\n\r\nstate  undertook  its  own  class size  reduction  initiative\r\n\r\nbeginning in 1996.  In the first year of implementation, more\r\n\r\nthan  a  fifth of the new teachers hired in that  state  have\r\n\r\nonly emergency credentials.  Hit hardest were schools serving\r\n\r\npoor  and  minority students, and in the hunt for new  space,\r\n\r\nadministrators  found themselves carving  classrooms  out  of\r\n\r\nbroom  closets  and erecting portable classrooms  on  top  of\r\n\r\nplaygrounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  is a real trade-off between quality and quantity,  and\r\n\r\nthe empirical evidence on the benefits of focusing on cutting\r\n\r\nclass  sizes  is  inconclusive, because  there  are  so  many\r\n\r\nfactors at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chronicle of Higher Education, April 1998, cited a\r\n\r\nwide  ranging  survey of the research that has been  done  on\r\n\r\nclass sizes.  This is the conclusion and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"277 studies have been done on the effects of class\r\n\r\nsize.   15% have found statistically significant benefits  in\r\n\r\nsmaller classes, while 13% found that on average, students in\r\n\r\nsmaller classes perform worse on tests.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling the number of teachers or increasing them by\r\n\r\none-third  or one-quarter, to halve our class sizes,  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  same thing as doubling the number of computers  to  half\r\n\r\nthe pupil-computer ratio, or even doubling the amount of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspace  provided in our schools.  Incidentally, we  are  doing\r\n\r\nboth  of  these.  With computers, you just put in  an  order.\r\n\r\nThey  will  arrive  next  week. And  most  importantly,  each\r\n\r\ncomputer that comes is of the same quality, or perhaps,  even\r\n\r\nmore  powerful  than the older models that are  currently  in\r\n\r\nservice. They might be even cheaper than the current  models.\r\n\r\nIf you order a lot of computers, you get a bulk discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we do that with teachers? Where do I order them\r\n\r\nfrom?   Please tell me. Would we enjoy a bulk discount if  we\r\n\r\nhire  more  teachers, and will they be as good as  or  better\r\n\r\nthan  the  ones  currently  in  service?   If  we  lower  our\r\n\r\nstandards and increase our intakes, they certainly  will  not\r\n\r\nbe,  either  in  terms of ability to teach or  motivation  or\r\n\r\naptitude.  The truth is, it is not easy to find good teachers\r\n\r\nto do all the things that we want to do.  This is a challenge\r\n\r\nthat is not unique to Singapore. The choice is not between 40\r\n\r\nstudents taught by a good teacher and two classes of 20, each\r\n\r\ntaught by a good teacher, but a class of 20 taught by a  good\r\n\r\nteacher, and the other class of 20 taught by a teacher who is\r\n\r\nperhaps not fit to teach by today's standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the approach that we are taking to build\r\n\r\nup our teaching force.  We recruit as many teachers as we can\r\n\r\nwho meet our standards and we have not limited the number  of\r\n\r\nteachers   that  we  can  recruit.   Indeed,  the   4,000-odd\r\n\r\nvacancies  that Mr Thomas has pointed out pertain  mainly  to\r\n\r\nthe provision for the recruitment of trainee teachers as they\r\n\r\nundergo  training at the National Institute of Education  and\r\n\r\nfloat  posts  to  hold  those on no-pay leave,  study  leave,\r\n\r\nprofessional   development  leave,   scholarships,   training\r\n\r\nawards, and so on. We have quite a lot of slack in the number\r\n\r\nof  teachers that we can recruit and if we are able  to  find\r\n\r\nthe teachers, to recruit as many as we want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been expanding our teaching force, we do\r\n\r\nso  with  an  eye to quality.  This means that  it  will  not\r\n\r\ntranslate  into dramatically smaller class sizes  across  the\r\n\r\nboard  any  time  soon. It is also because  of  the  changing\r\n\r\ndemographics of our whole teaching force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have been able to expand the size of our teaching  force,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  last four years.   But  because  student\r\n\r\nenrolments  in our schools have also been rising, the  growth\r\n\r\nof  our  teaching service has largely gone into  catering  to\r\n\r\nthis  increased enrolment.  Nevertheless, in spite  of  that,\r\n\r\nthere  has,  in  fact, been some improvement of pupil-teacher\r\n\r\nratios.   I  would  ask  the Clerk to distribute  some  data.\r\n\r\n[Handout distributed to hon. Members.]  At the primary level,\r\n\r\nover the last ten years, enrolment has increased by 19% since\r\n\r\n1990  or by some 50,000 students.   This means something like\r\n\r\nanother 2,000 teachers are required to cater to them.  But in\r\n\r\nspite  of needing an additional 2,000 teachers, we have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  do  a  little better than that.  Our  pupil-teacher\r\n\r\nratio in the primary schools has improved slightly from 25.8%\r\n\r\nto  24.9%.  At the secondary level, enrolment rose by 10%  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  10  years.  The pupil-teacher ratio improved  from\r\n\r\n21.7%  to 18.6%.  This means that in every school, there  are\r\n\r\nnow  more teachers per student to share the teaching  duties,\r\n\r\ncompared to, say, five years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that student enrolments in our secondary\r\n\r\nschools  will  continue to rise by nearly 20%  again  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming four years.  But because our target is to recruit  our\r\n\r\nteachers from the top third of each cohort, there is a  limit\r\n\r\nto  how  far  we  can  reduce  pupil-teacher  ratios  without\r\n\r\ncompromising  on  quality.  There is  also  a  reality  check\r\n\r\nneeded  to ascertain what proportion of the pool of potential\r\n\r\ncandidates who have the aptitude and interest and how many we\r\n\r\ncan  realistically attract to be teachers.  We do,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nrecruit   teachers  from  a  wide  range   of   sources   and\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, including non-university graduates,  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates  and  also  people in their  mid-career.   Not  all\r\n\r\nteachers  we  recruit are fresh graduates. Even  so,  we  are\r\n\r\ncurrently   already  recruiting  one  out  of   every   eight\r\n\r\nuniversity graduates, which is a very high level. Honestly, I\r\n\r\nam  not  confident  that  we  can  do  very  much  more  than\r\n\r\nrecruiting one out of every eight graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is right that the key is how best do we use\r\n\r\nthe teaching resources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we have.  How do we allocate them to get the most effect\r\n\r\nand  the  best  education that we can get for  our  children?\r\n\r\nGiven these constraints, the Ministry's position on deploying\r\n\r\nour  teachers  is to do so where the additional teachers  can\r\n\r\ncontribute most towards the learning of students.   One  good\r\n\r\nexample  is the Learning Support Programme (LSP) under  which\r\n\r\nP1  and  P2 students with difficulties in basic literacy  are\r\n\r\ntaught  in  small group sizes of between 8-10 students.   The\r\n\r\nLSP  supports 20% of P1 pupils and 10% of P2 pupils  and  the\r\n\r\nresults  have been quite impressive.  Over a 10-month period,\r\n\r\nP1  LSP pupils increase their reading age by 26 months,  thus\r\n\r\nnarrowing  their  reading  age deficit  by  16  months.   The\r\n\r\nclasses  are conducted by 214 teachers, whom we call Learning\r\n\r\nSupport Coordinators, and each of our primary schools has  at\r\n\r\nleast  one LSC.  This year, 10 primary schools will  get  one\r\n\r\nadditional teacher each to implement a similar programme  for\r\n\r\nMathematics on a pilot basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we spread these teachers out thinly to help reduce\r\n\r\nclass sizes across the board, the impact would be negligible.\r\n\r\nYou  will  not  feel it at all.  But by putting  the  teacher\r\n\r\nresources  in  areas that count, we are able to  make  a  big\r\n\r\nimpact on the students. It is more effective to identify  the\r\n\r\nlearning needs of the students and to design programmes  that\r\n\r\nhave high impact on a significant number of students and  use\r\n\r\nthe  teacher  resources that way, which may  include  smaller\r\n\r\nclasses  for specific subjects for specific periods  than  to\r\n\r\ntry to reduce class sizes across the board.  In this way,  we\r\n\r\nhave been able to cater to the learning needs of students who\r\n\r\ndeserve more attention, either because they are weaker as  in\r\n\r\nthe  Learning Support Programme, or because they have special\r\n\r\nabilities as in the Gifted Education Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to get more teachers and increase the\r\n\r\nteaching force, we will continue to look at how best  we  can\r\n\r\ndeploy these teachers, what programmes are available and  how\r\n\r\nwe  can  improve  the  learning outcomes  for  our  students.\r\n\r\nSchools  are  also given the flexibility to vary their  class\r\n\r\nsizes.  Some schools have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbigger  classes.  They have a good teacher who can deliver  a\r\n\r\nlecture  well to 80 students.  Some schools decide that  they\r\n\r\nwant to split their classes for their weaker students into 20\r\n\r\neach.   Some  have found that it has been useful,  some  have\r\n\r\nfound that it has no effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class sizes in the Normal and Express streams generally\r\n\r\nrange  from about 30-40 students.  In fact, parents  want  to\r\n\r\nplace  their children in the most popular schools even though\r\n\r\ntheir classes are filled to the brim.  As MPs, you would have\r\n\r\nheard that parents always come and make suggestions that, \"It\r\n\r\ncannot  make that much difference if you squeeze in one  more\r\n\r\nchair  and  desk there for my son or my daughter.\"   We  have\r\n\r\nheard  that many times.  If class size is indeed the sole  or\r\n\r\nthe  major  determinant  of  quality,  parents  would  choose\r\n\r\nschools  that  are less heavily subscribed as they  are  most\r\n\r\nlikely to have vacancies and, therefore, smaller classes. But\r\n\r\nthey  do  not.   While I started out by saying  that  smaller\r\n\r\nclass sizes have an intuitive appeal, all parents intuitively\r\n\r\nknow  and understand that there is more to quality than class\r\n\r\nsize, and it is indeed a multi-factorial issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about\r\n\r\nforeign Chinese language teachers in our education system.  I\r\n\r\nwill  address  one or two of the issues, but  not  the  whole\r\n\r\nrange.  To  help foreign teachers adapt to our  system,  they\r\n\r\nparticipate in induction programmes conducted by the Ministry\r\n\r\nbefore  they  are  deployed to teach.  They  receive  further\r\n\r\nsupport and guidance in their schools and clusters.  So  far,\r\n\r\nour   foreign  teachers,  including  Chinese  teachers,  have\r\n\r\ngenerally  performed  well and have adapted  to  our  system.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a few who do not demonstrate good performance  or\r\n\r\ngood work and they will not have their contracts renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have also asked about employing foreign\r\n\r\nteachers.   We  are  recruiting good  quality  teachers  from\r\n\r\noverseas.  We  now  have about 400 of them.   They  are  very\r\n\r\nuseful in specific\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas  but there is a limit to how many we can deploy in  our\r\n\r\nsystem.  There are two constraints.  First, good teachers are\r\n\r\nin acute shortage all over the world.  If we want to go to UK\r\n\r\nto  recruit  teachers, we must remember that they  just  came\r\n\r\nover  last year to recruit our teachers.  I am not  sure  how\r\n\r\nmuch  headway  we can make with that.  The second  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  foreign teachers may not be as sensitised to our  norms\r\n\r\nand values, such as multi-racialism, and this is why most  of\r\n\r\nour foreign teachers are in the secondary schools and not  in\r\n\r\nthe  primary schools because primary school students are very\r\n\r\nimpressionable  at a young age, and it is important  that  we\r\n\r\ngive them good guidance and values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline is that we want more good teachers and we\r\n\r\nwant  a  good  balance  between quality  and  quantity.   The\r\n\r\ncorrect  focus  is, therefore, on building  up  our  teaching\r\n\r\nforce,  while maintaining teacher quality.  Our main  efforts\r\n\r\nwill,  therefore,  be  directed towards recruiting  our  fair\r\n\r\nshare  of  talent  and retaining outstanding and  experienced\r\n\r\nteachers.   The  measures  include  giving  teachers   better\r\n\r\nsupport and recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked about what we have done on teacher\r\n\r\nworkload  and  administrative support.   More  administrative\r\n\r\nsupport  will indeed be provided to teachers.  Last  year,  I\r\n\r\nannounced  that we will provide one more extra administrative\r\n\r\npost  for  every school.  Providing one more  post  to  every\r\n\r\nschool will incur a budget of $20 million a year.  And indeed\r\n\r\nthis increases to three the number of administrative posts in\r\n\r\nschools,  compared to none just five years ago.  So  we  will\r\n\r\nmove forward and see how far we can go.  But there is also  a\r\n\r\nlimit  to how many people we can recruit because, as everyone\r\n\r\nknows,  there are also not enough people doing this  kind  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  work in Singapore.  But we  have  also  given\r\n\r\nschools  the flexibility and autonomy to buy support services\r\n\r\nto  assist  teachers in administrative duties, by using  this\r\n\r\nmoney.  So the post can be commuted to money, and the schools\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  use  their operating funds.  Some schools have  already\r\n\r\ndone  so.    Instead of employing one person  for  the  whole\r\n\r\nyear, they can employ four people for three months during the\r\n\r\npeak  periods,  if the schools feel that is what  they  need.\r\n\r\nSchools  can  also  use  this  fund  to  engage  people  with\r\n\r\nspecialised  skills, such as music instructors to  help  with\r\n\r\nCCA.   The Ministry of Education monitors the usage  of  such\r\n\r\nfunds and will increase the quantum, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be providing principals, HODs and teachers\r\n\r\nwith IT support to do their work better.  One example is  the\r\n\r\nintegrated  IT support system for schools, what  we  call  in\r\n\r\nshorthand  \"school cockpit\", which is being  developed  at  a\r\n\r\ncost  of  $35 million.  This is basically something which  is\r\n\r\nbuilt around teachers and enables teachers and school leaders\r\n\r\nto  have  all  the  necessary information, data,  statistics,\r\n\r\nfunctions  and so on that they need to manage the pupils  and\r\n\r\nto work better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also giving beginning teachers more support.\r\n\r\nBeing  a  teacher is intellectually stimulating but  it  also\r\n\r\nrequires hard work, and beginning teachers cannot be expected\r\n\r\nto  just  go into a school at the deep end and start working.\r\n\r\nSo  they are mentored and we also provide 80% of the standard\r\n\r\nworkload only for beginning teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about giving counselling and\r\n\r\nsupport to older teachers, apart from beginning teachers.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  do  have  a  counselling centre  in  the  teachers\r\n\r\nnetwork,  which is outside of the hierarchy of  clusters  and\r\n\r\nprincipals.   So teachers can avail themselves  of  that.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is a good idea and we will see what we can  do  to\r\n\r\nimprove counselling and so on for our teachers to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main initiative that we will be implementing for\r\n\r\nteachers this year is reshaping the teaching career, so  that\r\n\r\nit can better meet the Ministry of Education's organisational\r\n\r\nneeds  and the aspirations and talents of our teaching posts.\r\n\r\nWe want to create a culture of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessional  excellence which will attract  and  retain  the\r\n\r\nbest  teachers and a profession which nurtures the individual\r\n\r\nand  motivates all to achieve superior performance.  We began\r\n\r\nour  pay  and  career review for teachers in  September  last\r\n\r\nyear.   The initial broad recommendations include setting  up\r\n\r\nthe  teacher  and specialists' career tracks, in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  current managerial track to HODs and principals, so that\r\n\r\nMOE  can  build up a top notch team of professional teachers,\r\n\r\ncapable  leaders  and  dedicated specialists.   Part  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  review  also  examines how to  restructure  the  pay\r\n\r\nsystem, but it will look beyond just the tangible rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition for teachers will be reshaped within a total\r\n\r\nframework  that  includes  elements  such  as  learning   and\r\n\r\ndevelopmental opportunities.  For instance, the Ministry will\r\n\r\nspend  more than $1 million a year to fully sponsor  teachers\r\n\r\nfor  the  National Institute of Education's advanced  diploma\r\n\r\nand  advanced post-graduate diploma programmes.  I  will  not\r\n\r\nannounce details of the review today.  The review is expected\r\n\r\nto be completed soon, and I expect to be able to announce the\r\n\r\ndetails  within the next two months.  With these changes,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have put in place a strong framework for the Education\r\n\r\nService to continue to attract, reward and develop those with\r\n\r\na passion and aptitude required to be teachers, and this will\r\n\r\nhelp  us to have good teachers and enough of them to  do  all\r\n\r\nthe  good  things  that we want to do in  education  for  our\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform Members that\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\"  time on this amendment is  4.10  pm.

Originally,  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese  could only be studied by those in the  top  10%.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it was in 1994 when we opened it up and allowed  the\r\n\r\ntop  20%,  from 10% to 20%.  And last year, we opened  it  up\r\n\r\nfurther  to  allow  those  from  21st   to  30th  percentile.\r\n\r\nActually, one-third or 30% of the students now are able to do\r\n\r\nHigher  Chinese, or higher mother tongue now, which is really\r\n\r\na much broader band.  So it is three times the potential pool\r\n\r\nthan it used to be.  I hope that answers, to some extent,  Mr\r\n\r\nGoh's  desire  for  more students to be  able  to  do  Higher\r\n\r\nChinese.  But we still have a requirement for the students to\r\n\r\nbe  good in the languages, because we want to make sure  that\r\n\r\nin  the  course of doing Higher Chinese, they do not overload\r\n\r\nthemselves, and find that they are unable to cope with either\r\n\r\nthe languages or with the other subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> May I also seek a clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister  on  the implementation of the recommendations  from\r\n\r\nthe review of the mother tongue teaching?

The matter came  to  a\r\n\r\nconclusion  with  the exemption of three categories,  namely,\r\n\r\nmadrasah  students,  children  attending  designated  private\r\n\r\nschools  and  children  who  are tutored  at  home  by  their\r\n\r\nparents.   Although my focus for this cut  is  on  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation  (CE)  for  children with special  needs,  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if the Minister could also provide an update on\r\n\r\nnew   developments   concerning  compulsory   education   and\r\n\r\nmadrasahs.   Specifically, I would like to  ask  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinistry is convinced that the madrasahs are in a position to\r\n\r\ncope with the minimum requirements of PSLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to children with special needs, I recall the GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, raised this  issue  during  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory education debate last year.  The concern for  this\r\n\r\ncategory  of children still looms when our GPC met  with  the\r\n\r\nresource  panel members recently.  There is a strong  feeling\r\n\r\nthat  such  children should be integrated into  our  national\r\n\r\nschool  system  as  opposed  to  leaving  them  entirely   to\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations to worry about the plight  of\r\n\r\nthese  children.   The  idea is to  cultivate  awareness  and\r\n\r\ncompassion  within the wider school system  for  our  not-so-lucky  children who are born with disabilities from  a  young\r\n\r\nage.  Without some form of legislation, the education of such\r\n\r\nchildren\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepends  very  much on the VWOs running the special  schools.\r\n\r\nIn  many cases, places in such schools are limited and a long\r\n\r\nwaiting list builds up, resulting in some children not  being\r\n\r\nable to attend school.  This imposes a burden on the families\r\n\r\nand  subsequently  on  the special needs children  themselves\r\n\r\nwhen they become adults without any education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the current approach of delegating the\r\n\r\neducational responsibility of special needs children to  VWOs\r\n\r\nwithout  the  Ministry of Education's supervision  or  direct\r\n\r\nintervention  may not be in the spirit of providing  for  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  every  child, as embodied in the United  Nations'\r\n\r\nCharter of which Singapore is a signatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, although the number of such children is\r\n\r\nnot  very  many,  the special requirements and infrastructure\r\n\r\nneeded to cater to special needs children are varied and,  in\r\n\r\nsome cases, may be complex.  I would like to propose that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education conduct a detailed study of the  varied\r\n\r\nneeds  of  such children and thoroughly assess the situation.\r\n\r\nThe  findings  of  the study should be made  public  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, the current policy reviewed on the outcome of  the\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also encouraged to note that the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  earlier remarked that the focus  of  his  Ministry\r\n\r\nthis  year  will be on teachers.  I hope he does  not  forget\r\n\r\nalso  teachers  who are dealing with special needs  children.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  and Sports should  also  monitor  the\r\n\r\nschools  run  by  VWOs  catering to  special  needs  children\r\n\r\nclosely   and  allocate  additional  resources  to  them   as\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Government has decided to\r\n\r\nimplement  compulsory education.

Is there  an\r\n\r\naction  plan  worked out by the Ministry to coordinate  other\r\n\r\nkey  social  service agencies for the purpose of implementing\r\n\r\ncompulsory education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A lot has been reported on this. I understand that\r\n\r\nsome   quarters  of  the  Malay  community  are   still   not\r\n\r\ncomfortable with the implementation of compulsory  education.\r\n\r\nThey  are concerned about how the implementation would affect\r\n\r\nthe  long-term existence of madrasahs and whether,  with  the\r\n\r\nnew requirement, it might also dilute the religious character\r\n\r\nand  objective of setting up madrasahs.  Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\ntell us what he thinks the issues are and how he proposes  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the  issues  in  a satisfactory  way  to  allay  the\r\n\r\nconcerns of the Malay community?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, MOE is conducting a pilot\r\n\r\nprogramme  on  pre-school education.  In  today's  Singapore,\r\n\r\nevery  child enrolled in Primary 1 would have taken at  least\r\n\r\ntwo  years of kindergarten.  But not every child has the same\r\n\r\ntwo  years  of experience.  It ranges from private individual\r\n\r\nattention   programmes   to   the   more   egalitarian    PCF\r\n\r\nkindergartens.   It all depends on the wherewithal  of  their\r\n\r\nparents.   Some  parents  even send  their  children  to  two\r\n\r\nkindergartens  in one day.  The first one to  Montessori  for\r\n\r\nindividual  attention  and the second  one  to  PCF  for  the\r\n\r\ndiscipline that they will face when they enrol in Primary  1.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a fact that some children start Primary 1 much better\r\n\r\nprepared than the others.  The Minister in his reply  earlier\r\n\r\nhas  also  addressed  this matter when he  talked  about  the\r\n\r\nLearning Support Programme.  So it is debatable whether  such\r\n\r\nheadstart  that the children enjoy has any long term  impact.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think the confidence gained by some of these children\r\n\r\nwith the headstart could mean an insurmountable gap for their\r\n\r\nclassmates to catch up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we pride ourselves in providing an equal\r\n\r\nopportunity primary school education to our children so  that\r\n\r\nall  children,  rich  or poor, would  be  treated  the  same.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is  clear that with widening  income  gap,  our\r\n\r\nchildren  are not starting from the same starting  line  when\r\n\r\nthey  begin  the formal education in school.  I think  it  is\r\n\r\ntime now for the Ministry to provide subventions to certified\r\n\r\nkindergartens so that more qualified teachers could be  hired\r\n\r\nfor these kindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, parents need help to navigate through\r\n\r\na  wide  range of options available at the pre-school  level.\r\n\r\nVariety occurs in many ways - number of hours taught, type of\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  pedagogic  method  used,  teacher-pupil   ratio,\r\n\r\nrelative emphasis on language, second language, and the like.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, I think it is vitally important that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education as the recipient of the products of the\r\n\r\npre-primary  system helps parents understand the requirements\r\n\r\nand  what  they  ought to be looking for  at  the  pre-school\r\n\r\nlevel,  to ensure that their children go through an effective\r\n\r\nbut not stressful pre-primary education.  At the same time, I\r\n\r\nthink the pre-primary education institutions themselves  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  immensely  from  assistance  from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation   in  structuring  a  curriculum  that  will   lead\r\n\r\nlogically and naturally into what is taught at Primary 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister announced that there would be\r\n\r\ncertain  longitudinal studies done to understand  better  the\r\n\r\nvalue and the impact of pre-school education on children.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know,  first, what is  the  status  of  this\r\n\r\nlongitudinal  study; and secondly, in the interim,  while  we\r\n\r\nwait  for  the  outcome of the study, what is being  done  to\r\n\r\naddress some of the needs I have just outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, I would like to address some of the questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on pre-school education (PSE). Last year, I\r\n\r\nshared  with  Members  of  this House  MOE's  philosophy  and\r\n\r\napproach to reviewing the pre-school education in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our intention is to improve the quality  of  pre-school  education by focusing on certain areas where MOE  can\r\n\r\nhave high leverage while retaining its provision in the hands\r\n\r\nof the private and people sectors.  MOE would improve the pre-school curriculum, raise teachers' qualifications, set higher\r\n\r\nteacher  training  standards and more stringent  regulations.\r\n\r\nWe  had  also  announced that we would do  a  pilot  research\r\n\r\nproject  in order to guide our policy decisions.   So  it  is\r\n\r\ntimely  that  Mr  Iswaran has asked for  an  update  on  this\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the announcement that I made last year,\r\n\r\nseveral  key  pieces of the review have been  put  in  place.\r\n\r\nFor  example, we have delineated the Desired Outcomes of pre-school  education which focus on values, attitudes and skills\r\n\r\nrather  than specific academic competencies.  We have already\r\n\r\ndisseminated  this  set  of Desired Outcomes  widely  to  the\r\n\r\nservice  providers, and have also devised a set of curriculum\r\n\r\nguidelines  based  on  the Desired Outcomes.   These  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes serve as a timely reminder to educators and  parents\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of taking a longer term view to learning.\r\n\r\nOver-emphasising academic achievements and preparation for P1\r\n\r\nmay  yield immediate academic gains in a child, but they  may\r\n\r\nbe  at the expense of his motivation and love for learning in\r\n\r\nthe long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December last year, my Ministry and the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports jointly  introduced  a  new\r\n\r\nframework  for PSE teacher-training and accreditation.   This\r\n\r\nframework  provides a common training path for  professionals\r\n\r\nin  both  kindergartens and childcare centres and allows  for\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  of existing training programmes.   This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  enhance  the  standards  of  teacher-training   and\r\n\r\nincrease the attractiveness of the entire pre-school  sector.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  framework, all pre-school  supervisors  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  be  trained to diploma level in  four  to  five\r\n\r\nyears'  time.   During this transition period,  MOE  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development and Sports will facilitate\r\n\r\nas  many  existing  supervisors as  possible  to  attain  the\r\n\r\nrequired diploma qualifications.  As for accreditation, since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  announcement  of our accreditation  framework,  we  have\r\n\r\nstarted   to   process  the  applications  of  PSE   training\r\n\r\nproviders.  They have submitted their curriculum, etc, for us\r\n\r\nto accredit their training programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we have started a pilot research programme,\r\n\r\nin collaboration with the National Institute of Education, to\r\n\r\nstudy  the long-term cognitive and non-cognitive benefits  of\r\n\r\npre-school  education.  Establishing the long-term  value  of\r\n\r\nPSE  will allow us to make judicious investments in the  pre-school sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 2,000 K1 children from 46 selected pre-school\r\n\r\ncentres  are now involved in this study.  We have designed  a\r\n\r\nnew  PSE  curriculum with the Desired Outcomes in  mind,  and\r\n\r\nthis  new  curriculum will be child-centred,  developmentally\r\n\r\nappropriate  and  tailored  to  help  children  acquire   the\r\n\r\ncritical   foundations  of  learning.    Teachers   who   are\r\n\r\nparticipating  in  this programme have been  trained  to  use\r\n\r\nthese new materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of preliminary findings from this research\r\n\r\nprogramme is expected to be ready by the end of this year  or\r\n\r\nin about a year's time.  These findings will guide MOE in our\r\n\r\npolicy  planning  and help us determine  what  would  be  the\r\n\r\noptimal  investment in the pre-school sector.  As Mr  Iswaran\r\n\r\nasked,  while  we are waiting for the results of  this  pilot\r\n\r\nresearch  programme, we have been disseminating  the  Desired\r\n\r\nOutcomes  of PSE, designing the new curriculum, piloting  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum and training teachers for the pilot programme.  We\r\n\r\nare  also accrediting the training programmes which have been\r\n\r\nsubmitted by various training agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen spoke on the need to provide pre-school\r\n\r\ncentres,  especially  those that serve the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  who  are by no means rich, with more  support  to\r\n\r\nemploy  better  qualified teachers.   Besides  improving  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the teachers, kindergartens would also  need  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their curriculum and facilities in order to raise the\r\n\r\nquality  of  education.   We  are aware  that  managing  this\r\n\r\nupgrading process can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe a very challenging task, especially for kindergartens that\r\n\r\nare not-for-profit.  MOE is therefore looking into how we can\r\n\r\nprovide  the  not-for-profit kindergartens with resources  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  manage this upgrading process smoothly and  bring\r\n\r\nquality pre-school education to more children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the day, our effectiveness in\r\n\r\nimproving  pre-school education hinges on how  successful  we\r\n\r\nare  in  moving away from the current predominantly  academic\r\n\r\nfocus  towards  a more balanced and all-round development  of\r\n\r\nthe  child.   To  achieve this shift,  the  support  of  both\r\n\r\nparents and pre-school educators is critical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the questions on compulsory\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  progress  made so far in  the  implementation  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory education.  Mr Low, in particular, asked  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  framework that we put in  place  in  order  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  Compulsory Education  Act.   As  Members  are\r\n\r\naware, compulsory education will be introduced from the  year\r\n\r\n2003  for the age cohort entering Primary 1.  We are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  putting  in  place the necessary  mechanisms  to\r\n\r\nsupport  this introduction.  For instance, work is  currently\r\n\r\nunderway to establish the CE Board and gazette the subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation by mid-2002.  Under the CE Board, counselling and\r\n\r\nmediation procedures would be put in place to ensure that the\r\n\r\nlegal enforcement of CE would be taken only as a last resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked under what circumstances would parents be\r\n\r\nbrought to court.  In deliberating on the introduction of the\r\n\r\nCE  Bill,  we  provided  for legal  sanctions  against  those\r\n\r\nparents  who are recalcitrant and do not bring their kids  to\r\n\r\nschool,  but legal sanctions would be resorted to only  as  a\r\n\r\nlast  resort.   There would be a process of counselling,  and\r\n\r\nassistance  would  be  given to families  particularly  those\r\n\r\nencountering financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems,  relationship problems, and so forth, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan send their children to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the role of the CE Board would be to\r\n\r\nreview  cases  of  non-compliance  referred  to  it  by   the\r\n\r\ncounselling officers and, where necessary, refer the cases to\r\n\r\nthe  Director-General  of Education, who  can  then  raise  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to the Subordinate Courts for legal  action  as  a\r\n\r\nlast resort.  So between now and the implementation of CE  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  2003,  we  are  putting  in  place  these  various\r\n\r\nmechanisms   and   we  will  be  gazetting   the   subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation by the middle of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Low also asked about the\r\n\r\nresponse  or  what actions have the Malay community  made  in\r\n\r\norder  to adjust to the CE arrangements.  Sir, in making  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  the Committee on Compulsory  Education  had\r\n\r\nsolicited  feedback and views from the different  groups  and\r\n\r\ncommunities  who would be affected by CE, and  this  included\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community.  Specific recommendations, such as the\r\n\r\nPSLE benchmark that the madrasahs need to meet, were based on\r\n\r\nproposals put up by MUIS, in consultation with the madrasahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members may recall, this benchmark has been pegged at\r\n\r\nthe  average PSLE aggregate score of EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils\r\n\r\nin  the  six lowest-performing national schools.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthat the madrasahs are working towards meeting and surpassing\r\n\r\nthis PSLE benchmark.  After all, they have almost up to eight\r\n\r\nyears  from  now  till the first cohort of  the  P1  entrants\r\n\r\nprogresses to the PSLE level.  Or, up to six years  after  CE\r\n\r\nis  introduced in 2003.  I believe they are already beginning\r\n\r\nto prepare for this requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the exemption of special needs children from\r\n\r\nthe  framework  of CE is concerned, Mr Ahmad Magad  raised  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of questions.  Sir, exempting these children from  CE\r\n\r\nis a decision we have taken after very careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently,  we  have  a multi-tier system  to  cater  to  the\r\n\r\nspecial  needs  children, as Mr Ahmad Magad  is  aware.   For\r\n\r\nchildren  with  mild disabilities, they will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted into our national schools.  In fact, we have them in\r\n\r\nboth  the primary schools and secondary schools.  We  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with  additional support services as well  as  assisted\r\n\r\ndevices  to help them cope with integration and to study  the\r\n\r\nmainstream curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children with moderate to severe disabilities, it\r\n\r\nwould  be prudent to let their parents decide on the type  of\r\n\r\neducation  and  care  that would best meet  these  children's\r\n\r\nneeds.   In some cases, the disability of these children  may\r\n\r\nbe so severe or rare that homes or medical institutions would\r\n\r\noffer  them  better  support  and  care.   For  the  greatest\r\n\r\nmajority  of  children with special needs, they  are  already\r\n\r\nenrolled  in  Special  Schools where they  receive  intensive\r\n\r\nattention  from specially trained teachers, with the  support\r\n\r\nof  specialised equipment and the services of therapists.  It\r\n\r\nis better for them to attend these schools where they receive\r\n\r\nan education catered to their individual needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the good intention and concern of those who\r\n\r\ncall  for  CE to include children with special needs.   Under\r\n\r\nthe  \"many helping hands\" approach, MOE will continue to work\r\n\r\nwith  the voluntary welfare organisations, the community  and\r\n\r\nparents   to   provide  for  the  needs  of   children   with\r\n\r\ndisabilities.  Where necessary, more can be and will be done.\r\n\r\nCaring  for these children does not mean that we must  extend\r\n\r\nCE  to  them, or bring them under the framework  of  CE.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  doing  so, it may not be in the best  interest  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would recall, we have defined \"CE\" as education\r\n\r\nwithin  our  national  schools  which  teach  the  mainstream\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   Even  with CE, the parents  bear  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for ensuring that the child  attends  school.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  law  provides  for  penalties  for  recalcitrant\r\n\r\nparents who fail to do so.  In extreme cases, the parents may\r\n\r\neven be sentenced to jail.  For parents who are already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nburdened  with taking care of the child with disabilities,  I\r\n\r\nam sure the Member would not like to have them come under the\r\n\r\nlaw in such a manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemption of children with special needs from\r\n\r\ncompulsory  education is not a violation of  our  commitments\r\n\r\nunder the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Although\r\n\r\nArticle  28.1(a) of the Convention requires States to provide\r\n\r\nfree  and  compulsory  primary  education  to  all  children,\r\n\r\nSingapore  had entered a reservation to this Article  in  our\r\n\r\naccession  to  the  Convention.  Singapore is  therefore  not\r\n\r\nobliged  to  comply  with  this Article  of  the  Convention.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I emphasise that we have been taking  care  of\r\n\r\nthe needs of the special education children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad also asked that MOE should conduct a\r\n\r\nstudy  of the needs of the children and, based on this study,\r\n\r\nreview  the  provisions for them.  MOE is in fact  constantly\r\n\r\nreviewing the needs of these children.  However, their  needs\r\n\r\nare very diverse and complex.  A general study would not help\r\n\r\nin targeting assistance to where the needs are.  Instead, MOE\r\n\r\nhas  adopted  a  more targetted approach  for  children  with\r\n\r\nspecific  types of disabilities.  For example, we collaborate\r\n\r\nwith  the  Dyslexia Association of Singapore and  the  Autism\r\n\r\nResource  Centre  to  study  the needs  of  these  groups  of\r\n\r\nchildren  and  to  cater to them.  We are also  collaborating\r\n\r\nwith  a  new society called SPARK to examine how we can  help\r\n\r\nchildren with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder to\r\n\r\nsee how we can cater to these groups of children also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that our awareness of these conditions\r\n\r\n-  autism,  dyselxia,  attention  deficit  and  hyperactivity\r\n\r\ndisorder  -  has  only grown substantially in  recent  years.\r\n\r\nExpertise   and   resources  to  deal  with  these   learning\r\n\r\ndisabilities  are still lacking, not just in  Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nthe world over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for funding for special education children, let me\r\n\r\ninform the Member that, indeed, MOE has increased the funding\r\n\r\nover the years.  For FY1999, we devoted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$18 million to special education.  This is a capitation grant\r\n\r\nfor  recurrent expenditure.  We increased that to $24 million\r\n\r\nin  FY2000 and we are proposing a $27 million expenditure  in\r\n\r\nthe next financial year.  MOE has committed itself to provide\r\n\r\nup to a cap of 2.5 times the cost of providing primary school\r\n\r\neducation for special needs children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wong, \"guillotine\" time is 4.10 pm.\r\n\r\nWe still have quite a lot of speakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Can I just take one more second on the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list  because  Mr  Ahmad Magad  mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list is long?

University  places  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased.  Over the years, our universities have contributed\r\n\r\nto  the development of the country, successfully meeting  the\r\n\r\nhigh  level manpower needs of the nation.  Recently, however,\r\n\r\nthe  tempo  of  change  has speeded  up.   The  pace  can  be\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  fast  and furious, the  change  radical.   The\r\n\r\nimpact would be long term with changes to the culture of  the\r\n\r\ninstitution.  The resultant and intended consequences of  the\r\n\r\nchanges may not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessarily  match.  The implementation of  the  changes  can\r\n\r\nsignificantly  influence the result.  It may be  helpful  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to watch the changes and the impact and  advise\r\n\r\nthe universities, where appropriate and necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more of our young seek a university education.\r\n\r\nAmong  them  are  graduates from our polytechnics.   Although\r\n\r\nuniversity places have increased, they are not able  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe   growing  demand.   If  they  cannot  get   into   local\r\n\r\nuniversities, parents are prepared and will continue at great\r\n\r\nsacrifices  to  send their children to overseas universities.\r\n\r\nToday, many of our young are studying overseas and the number\r\n\r\nis set to increase.  Upon graduation, most will return home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the move by the Government to set up\r\n\r\na  fourth  university.  Some concerns have been expressed  on\r\n\r\nthe  quality of this university.  These concerns can be  met,\r\n\r\nif  the  establishment of the institution is premised on  our\r\n\r\nneeds  for its graduates, and the students are being able  to\r\n\r\nundertake  a  university education.  The university  can  set\r\n\r\nappropriate  entry criteria to make sure that only  qualified\r\n\r\nstudents are admitted.  Next, it must ensure that the content\r\n\r\nand  quality of instruction and the output criteria  befit  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree.  If this is done, we can be confident  of\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of its graduates and that its degrees  will  be\r\n\r\nrecognised and accepted.  It does not have to be exactly like\r\n\r\nNUS,  NTU  or SMU.  It will find its niche.  It will  not  be\r\n\r\nworse  than  the  education that the  students  will  receive\r\n\r\noverseas.  An education in the fourth university will be less\r\n\r\ndemanding and the parents will continue to enjoy the  company\r\n\r\nof  their  children  and the latter, the  guidance  of  their\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposal to set up a fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I will just keep it short.

Mr Loh\r\n\r\nMeng See has asked about the professional qualifications.   I\r\n\r\ndo not have the figures as to what percentage of students who\r\n\r\nhave successfully graduated from these programmes, decide  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  other professions later on.  I certainly will  take\r\n\r\ninto account the suggestion that he has and pass it on to the\r\n\r\nuniversities in the selection of students.  As you  know,  in\r\n\r\nselection  for  medical students, there is an interview  and,\r\n\r\nduring  that  interview,  they  will  try  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\naptitude,  the  perseverance and the  real  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents to take medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, in response to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's repeated call for life-long learning, many  mid-career  executives and workers are enrolling themselves  into\r\n\r\npart-time   and   distance  learning  in  undergraduate   and\r\n\r\npostgraduate overseas programmes, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves.

Competition for student enrolment\r\n\r\nis aggressive.  Apart from cheaper course fees, some offer  a\r\n\r\nmultitude  of  exemptions  and  shorter  time  for  programme\r\n\r\ncompletion  to  woo students.  Unwary people who  enrol  with\r\n\r\nsuch institutions may have to find out the hard way when  the\r\n\r\nqualifications they acquire are not recognised by prospective\r\n\r\nemployers or the Government.  Discontentment may set in  when\r\n\r\nthese  people are not able to obtain good jobs  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nhaving responded to the Government's call and, more so, after\r\n\r\nhaving invested large sums of money and personal time on such\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand the complexity of monitoring or\r\n\r\nsupervising standards of such programmes, my concern  is  for\r\n\r\nthis to become a potential social and political issue in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.

I was also hoping that I could  pick  up\r\n\r\nsome  business  management knowledge  in  a  more  systematic\r\n\r\nmanner  from the university.  To my surprise, after embarking\r\n\r\non  this  course, I discovered that I have not only learnt  a\r\n\r\nlot of new western and oriental business management knowledge\r\n\r\nbut  have also got acquainted with a lot of friends  who  are\r\n\r\nsenior executives in the Asia Pacific region.  They come from\r\n\r\nChina,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  have  therefore established a valuable regional  business\r\n\r\nnetwork  which  is of great help to me to explore  the  Asia-Pacific market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should expand this course so that there would\r\n\r\nbe  more  students  coming from the Asia  Pacific  region  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.

They are likely to  be  the\r\n\r\nhands-on  type,  probably  with a polytechnic  diploma  in  a\r\n\r\nrelevant  field, an \"A\" level qualification, or  someone  who\r\n\r\nhas  considerable  work experience in an  appropriate  field.\r\n\r\nThe  most important quality that the person must have is  the\r\n\r\ncapacity to be able to benefit from a degree-level education.\r\n\r\nHe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould be a full-time or part-time student.  If anything,  for\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  in mind, a part-time programme  lends  itself\r\n\r\nrather  well to an industry and practice-oriented  university\r\n\r\nwhere  real-life  problems,  from  the  student's  workplace,\r\n\r\nbecome a learning experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern has also been expressed as to the quality of the\r\n\r\ndegree, and how the public will view such a degree.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  concern  is  understandable.  Many  of  us  will  recall\r\n\r\nsimilar  concerns  when  NTU came  into  being  as  a  second\r\n\r\nuniversity.  In Singapore, the authority to award degrees  is\r\n\r\na  jealously-guarded, almost sacred privilege, and I want  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  House  that a degree programme,  or  the  fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity,  will  have  rigorous  admission  standards   and\r\n\r\ncriteria  appropriate  for an industry and  practice-oriented\r\n\r\ndegree.  It must have the support and acceptance of industry.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be a degree, as Dr Tan Boon Wan has said, different\r\n\r\nfrom  an  NUS  or  NTU degree, but it must  be  a  degree  of\r\n\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the issues the committee (chaired by\r\n\r\nme) that has been asked to look into the set up of the degree\r\n\r\nprogramme, will consider carefully.  We will study models  in\r\n\r\nthe US, UK and Germany for relevant lessons, and we will make\r\n\r\nour recommendations in the second half of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been some calls for continuing education\r\n\r\nand training, especially that we may make the best use of our\r\n\r\neducational  institutions, that we should align the  existing\r\n\r\nfacilities  there, to enable them to play their role  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision of continuing education and training.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  assure the House that those plans are in hand,  and  both\r\n\r\nthe   ITE  and  the  polytechnics  will  be  expanding  their\r\n\r\ncapacity,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  provision  of\r\n\r\ncontinuing   education   and   training   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Loh.

We have been the envy of many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   However,  we have paid  a  high  price  for  our\r\n\r\nprosperity  and economic success.  If you observe  carefully,\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporean married couples today have to work and more\r\n\r\noften  than  not, both the husband and wife have to  work  to\r\n\r\nsustain  their living needs.  Of course, some choose to  work\r\n\r\nbecause they want to be financially independent.  While  most\r\n\r\nchoose  to work because they have little choice as they  need\r\n\r\nto  maintain and sustain their high standard of living,  many\r\n\r\nalso  want  to provide their children with the best  possible\r\n\r\nfacilities and benefits.  As a result, many parents have very\r\n\r\nlittle  time because they usually leave their home early  and\r\n\r\ncome  home late.  Worse still, some even spend their  weekend\r\n\r\nworking instead of spending quality time with their children,\r\n\r\nnot  to mention fruitful communications with them.  As  such,\r\n\r\nover  time,  children would become detached and  bear  little\r\n\r\nfeeling  of closeness to their parents.  Many would not  even\r\n\r\nwant  to  share  with their parents when they  have  personal\r\n\r\nproblems.  It would have a very serious impact on our  social\r\n\r\nlife if this trend is not addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent times, we notice that a growing number of\r\n\r\nchildren are being looked after by domestic maids.   This  is\r\n\r\nnot  completely bad, but it does have undesirable effects  on\r\n\r\nthese  school-going children.  As most schools are still  run\r\n\r\non  a  half-day basis, these children will go home either  to\r\n\r\nface  the  four  walls of the house or the maid.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  the  maid  to  perform the  role  of  the  mother  in\r\n\r\nnurturing the children and supervising them in their studies.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  these  children have so much  time  at  their\r\n\r\ndisposal  that  they  end up loitering at  shopping  centres,\r\n\r\nvideo arcades or even lazing around the neighbourhood and get\r\n\r\nmixed  up with some bad hats and become juvenile delinquents.\r\n\r\nThis will eventually lead to more social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has started experimenting with single\r\n\r\nsession  schools. But I understand that such  single  session\r\n\r\nschools  are  mainly independent schools. In  most  of  these\r\n\r\nindependent schools, the children usually come from  families\r\n\r\nwith   better   educated   parents  who   are   professionals\r\n\r\nthemselves.  More often than not, these parents know  how  to\r\n\r\nnurture and educate their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is more on the neighbourhood schools. I\r\n\r\nwould like to urge the Government to introduce and expand the\r\n\r\nsingle  session  schools  to as many of  these  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools as possible.  They are schools with children from the\r\n\r\nlower-income  families.   Usually,  the  parents   have   low\r\n\r\neducation  and probably have to spend the whole day  working,\r\n\r\nand  have very little time or no time to spare.  Even if they\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  teach their children, very  often  they  are\r\n\r\nlimited  by their low education and knowledge, and  they  are\r\n\r\nunable   to  be  of  any  help  to  the  children.   So   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of single session schools will keep the children\r\n\r\noccupied with useful and beneficial school activities instead\r\n\r\nof indulging in unlawful activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can also use the time available to inculcate the\r\n\r\nvirtues  of  moral uprightness, respect for the elders,  etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, I understand that we are short of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers, but I think we can recruit more teachers so that we\r\n\r\ncan help these students with their studies and their work  by\r\n\r\ngiving them remedial classes, etc.  But I still hope that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  can step up efforts in recruiting and  training  of\r\n\r\nteachers.  The schools can also look into the possibility  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting  part-time tutors to provide proper  guidance  and\r\n\r\nconduct  useful activities for these children.  We know  that\r\n\r\nif we do not invest in our young now, it will eventually lead\r\n\r\nto  more  serious  problems later on.  Of course,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that the parents should push their responsibility  to\r\n\r\nthe  schools in the education of their children, but  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  the schools can play an important and critical role  in\r\n\r\neducating the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\norder  to  attend the graduation ceremony of my  daughter,  I\r\n\r\nvisited  London  last year,  and I took  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nstudy  how  they rank their schools in England.  Over  there,\r\n\r\nthe ranking of primary and secondary schools is only used for\r\n\r\ninternal reference by the Ministry of Education to find  ways\r\n\r\nand  means to encourage the schools to raise their standards.\r\n\r\nThey do not announce the ranking openly to the parents.  Only\r\n\r\nthe university rankings are made public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, ever since we implemented ranking of\r\n\r\nschools,  it  has caused some very intense competition  among\r\n\r\nthe schools.  All the schools wish to be ranked in the higher\r\n\r\nechelon  and,  therefore, many of these schools  engage  good\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers and take in only good students.   So,\r\n\r\nthe  good schools are always good and those teachers who were\r\n\r\nsent  to  the  top  50  schools are very happy  and  excited.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who were sent to those schools which  are  not\r\n\r\nlisted among the top 50 will be disappointed and demoralised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that the Ministry of Education should\r\n\r\nreview  this  ranking  of schools, and  let  the  schools  be\r\n\r\ntreated equally as institutions which impart knowledge to the\r\n\r\nstudents and nurture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  moral,  intellectual, physical, social  and  aesthetic\r\n\r\nqualities.  But, most importantly, the school ranking  should\r\n\r\nbe  used  only for the internal reference in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation as an assessment of the performances of the various\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this ranking system should be retained, I think MOE\r\n\r\nshould  consider  the method of banding.  Perhaps,  we  could\r\n\r\nrank all the schools into three bands.  First of all, set  up\r\n\r\nstandard  criteria for the banding, taking into consideration\r\n\r\nthe academic results, co-curricular activities, general moral\r\n\r\nstandard of the students in the various schools.  We can rank\r\n\r\nthem  as distinction, merit, pass, etc.  Those schools  which\r\n\r\nattain distinction grades in all the various aspects will  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as  band \"A\". Those with merit  grades,  will  be\r\n\r\nclassified as band \"B\", while those which score only a  pass,\r\n\r\nwill be classified as band \"C\" .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those schools which are in band \"C\" we should give\r\n\r\nthem  more   resources  and  other facilities  to  help  them\r\n\r\nimprove their performances. If the teachers and students  can\r\n\r\ncooperate and uplift the school from band \"C\" to band \"B\",  I\r\n\r\nthink  we should give some commendation to  the teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals. This will stimulate the teachers in the band  \"C\"\r\n\r\nschools   to improve the overall standard of the school.    I\r\n\r\nhope   that  all  the  primary  and  secondary  schools   can\r\n\r\neventually  reach  an  equally high standard.   I  feel  such\r\n\r\nbanding system is better than the present ranking system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the \"Cleanest Hawker Centre in Singapore\"\r\n\r\ncompetition.   Last  year,  we  only  picked  the  top  three\r\n\r\n\"Cleanest  Hawker Centres in Singapore\".  As a  result,  many\r\n\r\nstallholders told me that they did not stand a chance at all,\r\n\r\nand  they simply dropped out of the race. Last year, I picked\r\n\r\nthe top 10 \"Cleanest Hawker Centres in Singapore\" and many of\r\n\r\nthese  hawkers  were very positive in participating  in  this\r\n\r\ncompetition.   When the team of judges went to inspect  these\r\n\r\nhawker centres, they found that the general standard had gone\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is our town council. In the earlier\r\n\r\ndays, the Ministry of National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment ranked all the town councils from 1 to  16.   But\r\n\r\nwe  found that the top ones were always at the top and  there\r\n\r\nwas  only a  difference of 0.1 or 0.2 marks separating  them.\r\n\r\nThose  who were ranked lower down were demoralised  and  they\r\n\r\nfelt that they had done their best but they were still ranked\r\n\r\nat  the  bottom.  They  just could not be  bothered  with  it\r\n\r\nanymore.   Finally, MND decided to band them into bands  \"A\",\r\n\r\n\"B\"  and  \"C\".   As a result, this year when we  conducted  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  among  our  residents, we found  that  all  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  had  improved in their performance over  the  year.\r\n\r\nThis  shows that this banding system for the ranking  of  our\r\n\r\nschools  can be feasible and would encourage all the  schools\r\n\r\nto  participate  actively  in this competition  by  improving\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The \"guillotine\" time for this amendment\r\n\r\nis 4.50 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I will be very\r\n\r\nbrief although this can be a very long subject to talk about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always used the word \"tolerance\" when we\r\n\r\ndiscuss  race  relations.  But tolerance  implies  acceptance\r\n\r\nwithout  questioning  why.  We should  go  beyond  tolerance.\r\n\r\nMulti-racialism must never be taken for granted. We must work\r\n\r\nhard  at  it through actions and deeds.  To do this, we  must\r\n\r\nhave  an  appreciation and understanding of  the  lifestyles,\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  habits of each different race.  We  have  taken\r\n\r\nsteps  to  ensure a good multi-racial mix at our HDB estates,\r\n\r\nby  fixing the percentage of each racial group in an  estate.\r\n\r\nThen, when we noticed, after the 1984 general elections, that\r\n\r\npeople  were  voting along racial lines,  we  took  immediate\r\n\r\nsteps  to  prevent  the  possibility of  having  no  minority\r\n\r\nrepresentation in this House.  Can you imagine this House  of\r\n\r\nMPs  of Chinese origin, and yet we tell the world that we are\r\n\r\na multi-racial country?  Thus, we introduced the GRC concept,\r\n\r\nwhere a member from the minority race is essential in a slate\r\n\r\nof  candidates  to  be elected.  And because  of  the  rising\r\n\r\nreligious fervour around the region and the world,  we  acted\r\n\r\nfast by introducing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Maintenance  of Religious Harmony Act  to  preserve  the\r\n\r\nright  to  practise without fear or favour.  This will  allow\r\n\r\nour  multi-religious groups to conduct the practice of  their\r\n\r\nfaith  in  a free and fair way, as our racial groups practise\r\n\r\ndifferent religions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are positive actions that the Government took\r\n\r\nbecause  we  wanted to avoid racial conflict.  Our historical\r\n\r\npast  has examples of what can happen if there is a breakdown\r\n\r\nin  racial harmony.  These are actions taken after the events\r\n\r\ncame  to  light. Therefore, the best place that we can  start\r\n\r\nour  multi-racial culture is our schools.  Young children  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races play and fight together, without a  care  of\r\n\r\neach  other's  race or language.  Being innocent  and  fresh-faced,  they  enjoy  the  warmth and company  of  each  other\r\n\r\nwithout   prejudice.   Thus,  from  young,  we   must   avoid\r\n\r\nsegregation  of  pupils for administrative  convenience.   We\r\n\r\nmust, for example, encourage non-Chinese pupils to join China\r\n\r\ntours  instead  of taking only Chinese students.   Basketball\r\n\r\nshould  not  be a sport only for Chinese students.   Teachers\r\n\r\nmust have a high level of awareness on this subject.  It must\r\n\r\nbe  internalised  in them so that they can  handle  sensitive\r\n\r\nsituations  by not offering hamburgers to Malay students,  or\r\n\r\nbeef  to  Hindu  students.  Also, schools,  such  as  Special\r\n\r\nAssistance Schools and madrasah schools, should develop their\r\n\r\nown  programmes to allow students to understand  the  way  of\r\n\r\nlife of other races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, fundamental to just tolerance is this need to\r\n\r\nteach our students each other's culture and social behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen  our  children  from  young  are  constantly  doing  and\r\n\r\nexperiencing multi-racial social norms, it will not  just  be\r\n\r\nblind  acceptance of racial tolerance.  Multi-racialism  must\r\n\r\nbe  based on a strong foundation of understanding, knowledge,\r\n\r\naction  and deeds in schools that will carry them into  their\r\n\r\nworkplace and HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope that the Ministry will encourage schools of\r\n\r\ntheir  very  important role of promoting  multi-racialism  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> We have not been able to answer\r\n\r\nall the points that Members have raised today.

I  would particularly like to thank him for  all  his\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and  comments today.  The  reason  that  I  have\r\n\r\nresponded  to him so fully is because I take his  views  very\r\n\r\nseriously,  and I know that many people take his  views  very\r\n\r\nseriously and give them a lot of weight.  So, I felt  it  was\r\n\r\nimportant for me to respond to his comments as completely  as\r\n\r\nI  could  today,  just to make sure that  there  is  a  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding on the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Ong Ah Heng that, with the\r\n\r\nexception of two secondary schools, whose transition  to  the\r\n\r\nsingle  session system is tied to the completion of  the  new\r\n\r\nbuildings, all the other 160 secondary schools and three full\r\n\r\nschools  are  now  operating single session.   There  are  48\r\n\r\nprimary  schools operating single session, but most  of  them\r\n\r\nare  new  schools, and yet to achieve full  enrolment.   When\r\n\r\nthey  do,  they probably have to operate on double  sessions.\r\n\r\nEither  that  or  they are schools in mature  estates  facing\r\n\r\nfalling  enrolment,  or  they are primary  sections  of  full\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single-session programme is a significant step\r\n\r\nforward  for secondary schools and it has allowed schools  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  greater flexibility in the use  of  curriculum\r\n\r\ntime  and resources.  Our schools can now introduce  a  wider\r\n\r\nrange  of  enrichment  programmes to  cater  to  students  of\r\n\r\ndifferent abilities and family backgrounds.  The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will  consider  whether  to  have  single  session\r\n\r\nprimary schools when PRIME is closer to completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is a partnership among schools, parents\r\n\r\nand the community.  No\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  how  good a job our schools, our principals  and  our\r\n\r\nteachers  do,  they cannot and should not replace  the  love,\r\n\r\nconcern and support of the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to school ranking. One of the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  school ranking is to provide schools  with  a\r\n\r\nyardstick  to improve their performance.  This is not  unique\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  I am a little surprised that Mr Ang says that\r\n\r\nUK  does  not reveal their ranking data.  As far as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthey  actually do and also in quite considerable detail.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  our ranking is really very mild and  gentle.   We\r\n\r\nhave  something  like  350  schools,  200  primary  and   150\r\n\r\nsecondary.  We do not rank the primary schools.  Of  the  150\r\n\r\nor so secondary schools, we rank 50 of them.  In many places,\r\n\r\nincluding  UK, and in many states in the United States,  they\r\n\r\nrank  them from top to bottom.  In some states in the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  the avowed aim of putting the schools at the  bottom\r\n\r\nis to name and to shame them into doing something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can quite honestly say that in Singapore, I am not\r\n\r\nashamed of any of the schools that I have.  In our system,  a\r\n\r\ngood education takes place in all of them.  In our system, we\r\n\r\nfind  it necessary and useful to just rank the top 50.  In  a\r\n\r\nsense,  there  is  a band of the top 50 schools  for  Express\r\n\r\nstream  and  the  top 40 schools for Normal  stream.  I  have\r\n\r\ndistributed  the  data earlier on.  In  fact,  my  Ministry's\r\n\r\nfocus  in the ranking exercise is not on the absolute ranking\r\n\r\nof  the schools, but the value-added ranking, because if  the\r\n\r\nbest  students  go to a particular school, I do  expect  that\r\n\r\nthat  school  would  turn  up on the  top  with  an  absolute\r\n\r\nranking.  What I am more interested, and what parents  should\r\n\r\nbe interested in, should be the value-added ranking, which is\r\n\r\nto  say,  if a particular school has a student population  of\r\n\r\nthis  characteristic and this school is able to get more  out\r\n\r\nof  these  students  than would have been normally  expected,\r\n\r\nthen  there is something special about this school.  I  would\r\n\r\nask  parents, Members of this House and members of the public\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  the  value-addedness of the  ranking  exercise\r\n\r\nrather the usual focus on the absolute ranking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang has suggested that instead of ranking, we should\r\n\r\nuse  banding  instead.  To introduce a more well-rounded  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  framework for assessment, we introduced the  school\r\n\r\nexcellence  model  in  1999  that allows  schools  to  assess\r\n\r\nthemselves on how well they have achieved, both academic  and\r\n\r\nnon-academic  outcomes.  In addition, the  school  excellence\r\n\r\nmodel  appraises  management processes as  well,  since  good\r\n\r\nprocesses will ensure sustained results.  Mr Ang may be happy\r\n\r\nto know that banding of schools is practised under the school\r\n\r\nexcellence  model.   Depending on  how  the  school  assesses\r\n\r\nitself,  to  appraise itself in one of five bands  available,\r\n\r\nand  with  the first year's assessment as a base, the  school\r\n\r\nwill then chart its own progress, self-improvement strategies\r\n\r\nand  track its improvements up the band or to the next higher\r\n\r\nband  over  time.   The  school excellence  model  will  also\r\n\r\ninclude  other  things  which  are  non-academic  in  nature,\r\n\r\nincluding how they perform in other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come now to multi-racialism in schools? I\r\n\r\ncompletely  endorse what Dr Tan  Cheng Bock has said.   There\r\n\r\nare many principals and teachers in this House today as well,\r\n\r\nand I urge them to take that message away with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (In Mandarin) :</b> Sir, with our public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  still in need of further improvement,  the\r\n\r\nschool  bus  is still a very important service to our  school\r\n\r\nchildren.  But now, in our housing estates, multi-storey  car\r\n\r\nparks  are  replacing the parking lots on the  surface.  Many\r\n\r\nschool  bus  drivers have complained to  me  that  they  were\r\n\r\nfinding  it increasingly difficult to find places  for  their\r\n\r\nschool buses at night.  Even the schools do not allow them to\r\n\r\npark the school buses overnight in the school compound.   Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister please help?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to bring up one\r\n\r\naspect  of  polytechnic education, and this is in  regard  to\r\n\r\nbringing   in  of  foreign  students  into  polytechnics   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I would like to request the Minister  to  review\r\n\r\nthe current process, because part of it is done by direct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecruitment, which I think is the best and preferred way.  In\r\n\r\nsome countries, they use intermediaries or agents to bring in\r\n\r\nthe  students.  When doing this, I would ask the polytechnics\r\n\r\nto ensure that there is no profiteering in the process.  Even\r\n\r\nif there is no choice and they have to use an agent, we could\r\n\r\nwork  out  a  scheme  on the scope of  work,  what  they  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  do,  how  much they are  to  charge  for  their\r\n\r\nservices  and things like that.  Because they not  only  make\r\n\r\nmoney by bringing in the students, but once the students  are\r\n\r\nhere,  they charge for settling in cost, housing,  etc,   and\r\n\r\nfor  some of these charges, eg,  for housing, the margins are\r\n\r\nmore than reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is for the polytechnics to do this\r\n\r\nservice themselves.  Maybe the Minister could do a review  of\r\n\r\nthis matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.35 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, student care centres (SCCs)\r\n\r\nare primarily operated by voluntary welfare organisations and\r\n\r\nnon-profit  organisations with funding from the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports.  Some, I  understand,  are\r\n\r\nalso  operated  privately.   Some feedback  I  received  from\r\n\r\nparents  suggests that there is a commitment by the operators\r\n\r\nof  these  centres to synchronise their programmes  with  the\r\n\r\nschool  curriculum.   On  the other  hand,  I  also  received\r\n\r\nfeedback  from operators indicating that the programme  could\r\n\r\nbe  more  effective and beneficial for the  children  at  the\r\n\r\ncentres  if  neighbourhood schools where they  operate  could\r\n\r\ndirectly  cooperate  with them.  They will  be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to tailor programmes specific to the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  if  the respective school teachers  could  directly\r\n\r\ninterface  with  the SCC operators.  Based on  this  valuable\r\n\r\nfeedback  from  the operators themselves,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that a more coordinated approach be considered by the\r\n\r\nMinistry, as we extend this programme to more neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nThis could be linked directly with an individual or, for that\r\n\r\nmatter, a cluster of schools in the neighbourhood where  they\r\n\r\nintend to locate.  Programmes developed by these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncentres  could then be tailored such that they are correlated\r\n\r\nwith  the individual's co-curriculum.  Such an approach  will\r\n\r\nnot  only  benefit  the students but also the  SCCs  and  the\r\n\r\nparticipating schools, as it adds greater value for  all  the\r\n\r\nthree parties involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  reply to two questions.   Firstly,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  parking of school buses raised by Mr  Yeo  Guat\r\n\r\nKwang.   Strictly speaking, providing parking facilities  for\r\n\r\nschool buses is a matter that does not come under the purview\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of Education.  However, we understand and we\r\n\r\nare  sympathetic with the problems faced by many bus  drivers\r\n\r\nto  find  a place to park their buses.  In fact, since  1983,\r\n\r\nthe MOE has allowed overnight parking for school buses in our\r\n\r\nschools  mainly  to  help  solve the  problem  of  off-street\r\n\r\nparking faced by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position remains the same today. School bus\r\n\r\noperators  who  wish  to  park  their  buses  in  any  school\r\n\r\novernight may apply directly to the school concerned.  I hope\r\n\r\nthey will communicate with the school and find a way to get a\r\n\r\nplace  to park their vehicles.  Today, about a third  of  our\r\n\r\nschools are being used by school bus operators to park  their\r\n\r\nbuses overnight.  That is the situation today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad made some suggestions concerning the\r\n\r\nstudent  care centres.  Again, the activities and  programmes\r\n\r\nof  the  student care centres are matters that  do  not  come\r\n\r\nunder the purview of the Ministry of Education.  However,  we\r\n\r\nunderstand the concerns raised by Mr Ahmad Magad  as  to  how\r\n\r\nthey  could  maximise their programmes to benefit the  school\r\n\r\nchildren  in the areas where the SCCs operate.  One  way  for\r\n\r\nthe  SCCs to design their programmes to meet the needs of the\r\n\r\nchildren attending the centres, and if the children come from\r\n\r\na  few  schools  around the centres, I suggest the  operators\r\n\r\nengage the schools directly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalk to them and see how they can coordinate their programmes\r\n\r\nto benefit the students.  I am sure many of the schools would\r\n\r\nbe  happy  to  do  this.  Today, in fact,  various  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations  have been  discussing  with  schools.\r\n\r\nThey  started  it  in  the past and they  have  devised  some\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which are more suited to the children who  attend\r\n\r\nthe SCCs.  And I hope these people who raised the matter with\r\n\r\nMr  Ahmad  Magad could start a dialogue with the schools  and\r\n\r\ncome up with some programmes together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, Mr Thomas Thomas has said that the\r\n\r\npolytechnics,  in particular, should not use private  agents.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree with him.  They should not, and they do not  use\r\n\r\nprivate agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the point made here is really not private\r\n\r\nagents,  but the concern is that some students may  be  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of by certain individuals, and it goes beyond  just\r\n\r\nrecruitment.   Mr  Thomas also referred to  what  they  might\r\n\r\ncharge  for  bringing  them in and so  on.   I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult for the polytechnics  really  to  police\r\n\r\nthis.  It may well be a case for CASE really.  It could  well\r\n\r\nbe  that.   But  beyond making very clear  to  all  potential\r\n\r\nstudents  that the polytechnics do not use any agents  or  do\r\n\r\nnot  take  account of any lobbying by anybody for  admission,\r\n\r\nand  admission is based strictly on merit, there is not  much\r\n\r\nthat  we can do beyond that.  However, if Mr Thomas has  some\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  we  will be very glad to see how  publicity  in\r\n\r\nthis matter may be followed up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, as a clarification, if the\r\n\r\nforeign  students  are already here and they  have  problems,\r\n\r\nwould there be some sort of apparatus or mechanism to address\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  problems  and  grievances?   And  would  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics help the students to resolve these problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, every polytechnic indeed has got\r\n\r\npersonnel  who  will  help students  and  deal  with  student\r\n\r\naffairs.

But at the end of the day, it may well be something\r\n\r\nthat  they have to be careful about, and the remedy may  have\r\n\r\nto be sought outside the polytechnic system, eg, CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Inderjit Singh is\r\n\r\nnot here.

This situation is made worse if the school happens to be\r\n\r\na  better  known  and  popular school,  when  the  estate  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  new  with many young parents having  children  of\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 school-going age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was the case last year in my ward when Rosythe\r\n\r\nSchool  was  relocated  to Serangoon North  Avenue  4.   Many\r\n\r\nparents  in the immediate neighbourhood, some of whom  living\r\n\r\njust  a  stone's  throw away from the school, were  extremely\r\n\r\ndisappointed  when their children could not be accepted  into\r\n\r\nthe  school,  even  though  they live  well  within  the  one\r\n\r\nkilometre  radius.   These unsuccessful  children  were  then\r\n\r\nsubsequently given places in other schools, many of which are\r\n\r\nsome distance away from their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, depending on the luck of the draw,\r\n\r\nchildren  living, say, one kilometre away may be  successful.\r\n\r\nThe result is that there will be many children travelling  by\r\n\r\nbuses  every school day to their respective schools.   Surely\r\n\r\nthis  defeats  the  purpose of having  neighbourhood  schools\r\n\r\nwhich,  presumably, are to have pupils living  close  to  the\r\n\r\nschools,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso that travelling time for the pupils would be minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had this system for sometime now. While it\r\n\r\nhas  worked quite well in the past, I believe it needs  fine-tuning now to satisfy the needs of a new breed of parents who\r\n\r\nare   now   very  much  more  involved  in  their  children's\r\n\r\neducation, especially at Primary 1 level.  I would  therefore\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest to the Minister to review and fine-tune  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   For example, one way could be to rank the  distance\r\n\r\nof each household from the school, and the ranking to be used\r\n\r\nto  allocate  the  available places based  on  the  household\r\n\r\nnearest  to  the  school having the pole position.   In  this\r\n\r\nexample, though within the one kilometre radius, those nearer\r\n\r\nto  the  school will have greater priority than those further\r\n\r\naway.  This method, I am sure, will ensure the children could\r\n\r\ngo  to schools situated next door to their homes.  I am  also\r\n\r\nvery  sure  that the Ministry could come up with  many  other\r\n\r\nideas.   The point is that the current system needs  refining\r\n\r\nand perhaps it is time to do such refinements now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we agree that the\r\n\r\nschool  holidays are very important to our teachers.   During\r\n\r\nthe   holidays,  they  can  do  some  reading  up  to  enrich\r\n\r\nthemselves  and,  most importantly, they can drop  everything\r\n\r\nfrom  their heavy school commitments, and relax.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  see   more  and  more  of  our  teachers  going  to\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nowadays I discover that many of the teachers have\r\n\r\nto  participate in many of the school activities, and this is\r\n\r\nbecoming an increasing trend, particularly HODs who  have  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  school every day during the school holidays.  I  hope\r\n\r\nMOE  will  review this matter and make sure that our teachers\r\n\r\nwill have enough time to rest or to recharge themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, this point that I am raising on\r\n\r\nprivate  tuition  has been covered by the  Minister  earlier.\r\n\r\nBut I just want to add on to the points and say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the normal course of teaching, it should be sufficient for\r\n\r\nmost  students to learn everything they need to  learn  in  a\r\n\r\nclassroom  and  then  maybe with a  little  bit  of  remedial\r\n\r\nteaching.   But  if  our  students  have  to  have  classroom\r\n\r\nteaching,  remedial teaching, private tuition,  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncope, then some fundamental questions need to be asked.   Are\r\n\r\nwe  teaching  the right way or is there something  about  the\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  knowledge that needs to be  relooked?   Tuition\r\n\r\nalso  adds on to the stress of students, because I have  come\r\n\r\nacross  children who say that they are very  busy.   I  asked\r\n\r\nthem  why,  and they said they have got mother's homework  to\r\n\r\ndo,  school homework to do and tutor's homework  to  do.   So\r\n\r\nthey  seem to be always laden with work, work, work.  It  may\r\n\r\nbe a good way of starting off for their working life by being\r\n\r\nhardworking, but I think we should also allow our children to\r\n\r\nenjoy the fullness of childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that many of the less\r\n\r\nwell-off  parents,  who  may not be able  to  afford  private\r\n\r\ntutors,  may be at a disadvantage.  So we should try to  have\r\n\r\nan  education  system in which school teaching  and  remedial\r\n\r\nclasses should be sufficient for all students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, on priority of allocation of\r\n\r\nPrimary  1  places,  MOE provides sufficient  primary  school\r\n\r\nplaces to accommodate all children.  No child is deprived  of\r\n\r\na  school place and the majority of parents are able to enrol\r\n\r\ntheir children in schools near their homes.  While there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient  vacancies for all, my Ministry cannot accommodate\r\n\r\nall  requests for any particular schools as vacancies in each\r\n\r\nschool  are limited.  The existing guidelines have become  an\r\n\r\naccepted  means for parents to enrol their children into  the\r\n\r\nlimited vacancies in popular schools.  Normally, parents  are\r\n\r\nable  to  secure places in primary schools without balloting.\r\n\r\nBut for those schools where the number of registrants exceeds\r\n\r\nthe  available  places, there has to be an allocation  system\r\n\r\nthat   takes  into  account  a  number  of  different,  often\r\n\r\ncontending factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current P1 Registration System, children who\r\n\r\nstay nearer to the school do get priority over those who stay\r\n\r\nfarther  away.  Should the demand for the school  exceed  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  vacancies in any phase of registration, balloting\r\n\r\nwill  be  conducted.  Priority will be given first  to  those\r\n\r\nchildren living within one kilometre of the school,  then  to\r\n\r\nthose  children living within two kilometres of  the  school,\r\n\r\nand   finally  to  all  the  other  children  more  than  two\r\n\r\nkilometres away from the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mr Heng is suggesting is a further or finer\r\n\r\ndivision of priority, so that some children get places at the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  others  who might get places under  the  present\r\n\r\nsystem.   There is no perfect system, Sir, that  can  satisfy\r\n\r\neveryone.   Mr  Heng's  model  of  replacing  balloting  with\r\n\r\nregistration  by  proximity  also  has  its  drawbacks.   For\r\n\r\nexample, with such a system, we may have to admit a child who\r\n\r\nstays  100 metres away from a school but reject one who stays\r\n\r\n101  metres away, for both of whom the school in question  is\r\n\r\nthe  nearest.  Is such a rejection more acceptable to parents\r\n\r\nthan  for them to fail in securing a ballot?  I do not  think\r\n\r\nso.   What about for children who stay at equal distance away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  school,  say, in the same HDB block?   How  do  we\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  who from that block should get admitted?   For\r\n\r\nsuch cases, we still have to resort to balloting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system attempts to strike a balance between\r\n\r\nvarious  important  considerations for P1 registration,  from\r\n\r\nrecognising  the importance of placing siblings in  the  same\r\n\r\nschool,  to  distance  from home, to  relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nschool.   MOE  is prepared to consider another  model  of  P1\r\n\r\nregistration if there is a better model.  However, till  that\r\n\r\nbetter model is found, MOE has no plans to change the current\r\n\r\nestablished  P1  registration  guidelines.   Nevertheless,  I\r\n\r\nthank  the Member for speaking about this subject and putting\r\n\r\nforth his suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for school holidays, an issue raised by Mr Yeo Guat\r\n\r\nKwang,  our principals are mindful of the fact that  teachers\r\n\r\nneed  regular breaks in order to recharge themselves for  the\r\n\r\nnew term or academic year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  do  ensure that all their teachers get  some  time  off\r\n\r\nduring the school vacation.  Such time-off can take place any\r\n\r\ntime  during  the  year's school holidays, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nschool's schedule and the teachers' duties.  All our teachers\r\n\r\nshould  have  more than two weeks' continuous break,  usually\r\n\r\nduring  the  December  school vacation.   The  scheduling  of\r\n\r\nteachers'  involvement  in activities and  programmes  during\r\n\r\nschool  vacation is generally worked out by the  school,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes by the individual teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity and range of activities and duties vary\r\n\r\nfrom  school  to  school, and from teacher to  teacher.   The\r\n\r\nprincipal has an overview of this in his school and will work\r\n\r\nas  much  as  possible to balance the load on  the  teachers.\r\n\r\nTeachers  can  be  involved in professional  development  and\r\n\r\nstudent  activities, in the areas of remedial enrichment  and\r\n\r\nCCA  during  the school holidays.  Our principals  are  aware\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to  organise school activities  during  the\r\n\r\nholidays  such that teachers have a significant period  where\r\n\r\nthey can take time off for a short break, and spend time with\r\n\r\ntheir family.  Our principals are already doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of tuition, which Mr Thomas briefly touched\r\n\r\non, it is one of those phenomena or intractable problems that\r\n\r\nsocieties  such  as  Japan and other  East  Asian  societies,\r\n\r\nincluding  China,  Hong Kong and Taiwan face,  where  parents\r\n\r\nplace  a  high premium on their children's academic  success.\r\n\r\nDemand  for  tuition  in Singapore is actually  driven  by  a\r\n\r\nnumber of factors.  Among them, the aspiration of parents for\r\n\r\ntheir  children is a main factor.  Where the child's  mastery\r\n\r\nof  certain  subjects is weak, I agree with my Minister  that\r\n\r\ntuition  and  remedial classes indeed  can  help  the  child.\r\n\r\nRemedial  lessons  can help.  In the past,  educated  parents\r\n\r\nwould  often  coach their own kids after school or  supervise\r\n\r\ntheir  children  in  doing  homework.   Nowadays,  with  many\r\n\r\nworking  couples, many parents find it difficult to have  the\r\n\r\ntime  to  do  so  for their children.  There  are  also  some\r\n\r\nparents  who  feel  they  have lost  touch  with  the  school\r\n\r\ncurriculum or are outdated in what they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknew  from  their old school days.  These parents would  also\r\n\r\nhire  tutors to help their kids with their homework.  I think\r\n\r\nthat  in  itself should not pose much of a problem,  although\r\n\r\nideally  the parents should still take interest and  continue\r\n\r\nto guide their children in their home study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also parents who hire tutors in order\r\n\r\nthat  their kids can improve their grades from, say,  90%  to\r\n\r\n95%,  to  98%,  or to obtain advance coaching  ahead  of  the\r\n\r\nclass,  whether  it  is  by a couple of  advance  lessons  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  even by coaching ahead of the next academic  year.\r\n\r\nBesides  overloading  the child, this practice  can  actually\r\n\r\ncause  the child to lose interest in school and attentiveness\r\n\r\nin  class.  The long-term effects on the child can  be  quite\r\n\r\nharmful.   I  think giving too much tuition to children  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  already tired from school is going to add  to  the\r\n\r\nstress level for the kids, and even for the parents who often\r\n\r\nhave  to  cart their children back and forth from one tuition\r\n\r\nsession to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuition takes time away from the child's rest and\r\n\r\nrecreational needs and eats into the time that the child  has\r\n\r\nfor reflection and for doing creative things by himself.   It\r\n\r\nmay reduce the child's sense of self-discipline because it is\r\n\r\nbest that he takes personal responsibility for completing his\r\n\r\nown  homework.  Worse still, it can kill the child's interest\r\n\r\nin  school.  Too much tuition would turn the child  off.   As\r\n\r\nparents,  we  should  be  mindful  of  the  impact   of   our\r\n\r\nexpectations on children's learning and stress levels, and be\r\n\r\ncareful not to overburden them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools currently provide adequate time and\r\n\r\nattention to students to learn their academic subjects fully.\r\n\r\nTeachers  regularly give remedial classes to those  who  need\r\n\r\nhelp  with  their  school work.  At the  primary  level,  the\r\n\r\nlearning support programme gives additional support to  those\r\n\r\nidentified to be weak in English and Mathematics.  The ENABLE\r\n\r\n(Encouraging Achievement and Better Learning) programme gives\r\n\r\nadditional  support  to  those who are  not  achieving  their\r\n\r\npotential.   Our  curriculum  has  given  more  emphasis   to\r\n\r\ncritical and creative thinking skills.  At\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  we  have reinforced the importance  of  co-curricular activities to enhance core skills and values among\r\n\r\nour students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools therefore offer a holistic and broad-based\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  a  child.  Tuition  cannot  and  should  not\r\n\r\nsubstitute for the education that a child receives at school.\r\n\r\nThere will always be parents who wish to supplement this with\r\n\r\ntuition.  This is a choice for parents to make and,  I  hope,\r\n\r\nto make judiciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you very much for so much time for me to talk\r\n\r\nabout tuition.

May I ask her whether  this  is\r\n\r\nfairer  than the current system where someone next  door  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to  get  a place, whereas someone  living  one\r\n\r\nkilometre away can still get a place, depending on  the  luck\r\n\r\nof the draw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I think he did not hear what I say.

So is it fairer for the allocation  of\r\n\r\nschool  to  be  decided by a balloting which is  transparent,\r\n\r\nwhich  everybody  watches, which everybody  knows  about  the\r\n\r\nprobability  of  success,  than  to  draw  a  ranking  system\r\n\r\naccording to distance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng, can you withdraw your amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, \"guillotine\" time is 5.13 pm,\r\n\r\nI believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although it is true that it is all within the one-kilometre radius and it might be nearest to the school for\r\n\r\nboth  pupils,  surely  if  you are  talking  about  distance,\r\n\r\nsomeone  living next door should have a better priority  than\r\n\r\nsomeone  living  one kilometre away.  In any case,  both  are\r\n\r\nequally in the same situation by being nearest to the school,\r\n\r\nwhichever school it may be, but at least the one next door is\r\n\r\nnearer than the other who is  one kilometre away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I am sure the Member in his meet-the-people sessions has also encountered cases where some\r\n\r\nfamilies  pleaded for priority to be admitted on grounds  of,\r\n\r\nsay, the child's sickness, or that the mother is working  and\r\n\r\nis  unable  to  bring  the  child  to  school,  or  that  the\r\n\r\ngrandparent   cannot  manage  to  take  care   of   so   many\r\n\r\ngrandchildren.   So  these families are also  in  need  of  a\r\n\r\npriority of allocation.  I think whatever system we adopt, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  draw  a line somewhere.  And when we draw  a  line,\r\n\r\nthere are always people on the border.  Balloting so far  has\r\n\r\nbeen accepted by the parents as a very established procedure.\r\n\r\nSo  until we can find a better system, we will stick to  this\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I find it difficult to\r\n\r\nunderstand why the Senior Minister of State should  bring  in\r\n\r\nother  people's arguments, like people being sick, one parent\r\n\r\nlooking  after  so  many  children.

Sir,  there  are many different  environmental\r\n\r\nrankings  for  Singapore.  The Political  and  Economic  Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy   Ltd   ranked  Singapore,  among   other   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries,  to  be  the best of the three  out  of  the  five\r\n\r\nenvironmental   factors  under  their   consideration.    The\r\n\r\nGreening Industry Network Index (GIN-DEX), with Thailand  and\r\n\r\nUS  collaborations, tried to link economics and environmental\r\n\r\ndevelopment  with  the  consideration  of  energy  used   and\r\n\r\npollution control.  Singapore is ranked No. 8 out of  the  36\r\n\r\ncountries  under  their  ranking.   They  also  plan  to  use\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a model to show others how one could deal  with\r\n\r\ntheir environmental pollution while developing their economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also rated to be one of the 15 top most\r\n\r\nliveable  cities in the world.  I would like to ask  why  the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Task Force of the Global Leaders  of  Tomorrow\r\n\r\nrated us so low in its Environmental Sustainable Index (ESI).\r\n\r\nIs  the  way  in computing the index not adequate  enough  to\r\n\r\nreflect our environmental friendliness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sustainable environment is an issue where not many\r\n\r\npeople  can understand its implication.  In the modern  world\r\n\r\nwe  live  in, we consume a large quantity of fossil fuel  and\r\n\r\nraw  materials,  like iron, copper and  aluminum.   Even  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  friendly three-way catalytic  convertors  that\r\n\r\nreduce  vehicle  pollution, the materials, like  rhodium  and\r\n\r\npalladium,  that  are  used are not  sustainable.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, once they are consumed, they are almost gone forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment is not sustainable as far as the\r\n\r\nresources, that I have cited, are concerned.  Therefore, when\r\n\r\nwe  talk  about sustainable environment, besides  encouraging\r\n\r\nthe  use of renewal energy sources, we are trying to conserve\r\n\r\nthe  resources and sustain them for as long as possible.  The\r\n\r\nconcept  is  therefore  not to prevent  consumption,  but  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  consumption with efficient use.   The  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich we should approach the sustainable environment issue is\r\n\r\nto do it in the most feasible way of reduction, recycling and\r\n\r\nreuse  of  resources.   In the energy issue,  we  should  aim\r\n\r\ntowards  the  best conversion of the efficiency  from  fossil\r\n\r\nfuel  to  electricity  and to make the best  efforts  in  the\r\n\r\nconservation   of   energy   at  home,   offices   and   road\r\n\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard that our Government has introduced\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  recycled programmes for wood, paper,  aluminum\r\n\r\ncans  and  glass bottles.  However, we did not  see  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  products sold in the local market using  the  recycled\r\n\r\nmaterials.  Where have these recycled materials gone?  Is the\r\n\r\neffort  taken by the Government in the promotion of recycling\r\n\r\nnot  enough  for  us  to  see the  resultant  impact  of  the\r\n\r\nrecycling movement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what measures have we taken to promote\r\n\r\nenvironmental   sustainability  on  reusing,  recycling   and\r\n\r\nreducing?  What is our policy in environmental sustainability\r\n\r\nin road transportation, power generation, energy conservation\r\n\r\nfor homes, offices, factory buildings and even for the random\r\n\r\ndemolition of relatively new buildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, like my GPC\r\n\r\nChairman, I am quite surprised to come across this  study  by\r\n\r\nthe  Global Leaders for Tomorrow Environmental Task Force  on\r\n\r\nthe  2001  Environmental  Sustainability  Index  which  rated\r\n\r\nSingapore as one of the 10 worst performers in the world.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  it ranked Singapore 9 out of 10 worst, below countries\r\n\r\nlike  Bangladesh,  Nigeria  and  Vietnam.   Although  in  the\r\n\r\ndetailed  report, Singapore was ranked half way  through  the\r\n\r\nbottom  half of the 122 countries assessed, it is still  well\r\n\r\nbelow countries like Sri Lanka, Russia, Fiji and Ghana.  As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironmental  quality is one of the major factors  that  our\r\n\r\ninvestors  consider before they commit their  investments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, such an international study may harm our effort in\r\n\r\nattracting international investors.  The study did answer why\r\n\r\nSingapore scored so low and insisted that the index indicated\r\n\r\nin  the  report was accurate.  Of course, the correctness  of\r\n\r\nthe indexing methodology used by the task force is debatable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  an  international  report  like  this  can  do\r\n\r\nSingapore's  image,  as an environmental friendly  nation,  a\r\n\r\ngreat discredit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many other studies, like my GPC Chairman said,\r\n\r\nhave  ranked  Singapore very high, we still need  to  clarify\r\n\r\nsuch a well published study.  Therefore, I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether they have made any detailed study on the\r\n\r\nreport  to  find  out  the  actual cause  for  them  to  rate\r\n\r\nSingapore so low and to come out with an explanation so as to\r\n\r\nput  our  views  across to counter this  seemingly  incorrect\r\n\r\nassessment.   It is thus important that this is done  through\r\n\r\ninternational media so as to affirm our commitment to  upkeep\r\n\r\nour high environmental standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, both my GPC Chairman and\r\n\r\nDeputy Chairman have already spoken on the Global Leaders  of\r\n\r\nTomorrow  Environmental  Task Force report  called  the  2001\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Sustainability Index.  What is interesting  is\r\n\r\nthat  the study used 22 indicators covering issues,  such  as\r\n\r\nenvironmental  systems, stress reduction, human vulnerability\r\n\r\nreduction,  social  and  institutional  capacity  and  global\r\n\r\nstewardship   in  environmental  management  protection   and\r\n\r\nparticipation to arrive at the index.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Chen has said, 122 countries were indexed on\r\n\r\na  scale  of 0:100 with Finland scoring the highest  with  an\r\n\r\nindex  of  80.5, and Kuwait with the lowest with an index  of\r\n\r\n24.7.   Singapore was ranked 65 to an index of  46.8,  behind\r\n\r\nsome  Asian  neighbours, such as Japan and Malaysia.   I  use\r\n\r\nthis  because,  at  about the same time,  there  was  another\r\n\r\nreport on the quality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  environment  by  the  Political  and  Economic  Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy   Limited.   This  report  covered   only   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  and Singapore scored ahead of the other countries,\r\n\r\nlike  Japan  and Malaysia, as having the best environment  in\r\n\r\nAsia, as I have just mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why the difference? The answer apparently lies in\r\n\r\nthe  objectives of the two studies.  The first report was  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  the  ability of a country to sustain its environment\r\n\r\nas  it  develops further into the future.  The second was  to\r\n\r\nmeasure the quality of a country's environment, as it is now,\r\n\r\nat  the prevailing time.  So in other words, I take it  that,\r\n\r\nwhile  the quality of our environment is high now, very good,\r\n\r\nthe question remains that: can we sustain it and continue  to\r\n\r\nkeep the quality high in the future as more demands, such  as\r\n\r\npopulation growth and economic development, are made  on  it?\r\n\r\nThe answer appears to be negative going by the World Economic\r\n\r\nForum Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is nothing new. There are many disadvantages\r\n\r\nwe have in this area, such as small land mass, lack of forest\r\n\r\nand rural areas, high population density, or relatively large\r\n\r\nindustrial  base, and the like, work against us in sustaining\r\n\r\na  good environment.  Yet despite these factors, as shown  by\r\n\r\nthe  PERC  report, we are able to maintain a good environment\r\n\r\nnow, through the many initiatives that we have taken, such as\r\n\r\ntree   planting,  garden  city  concept,  cleaning   of   our\r\n\r\nwaterways, especially the Singapore River, and also  all  the\r\n\r\nother anti-pollution regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, these and many other programmes of the\r\n\r\nMinistry have served us well.  However, I would like to  take\r\n\r\nthe World Economic Forum Report as an early warning signal, a\r\n\r\nwake-up  call, so to say.  The question we should  be  asking\r\n\r\nourselves  is:  are we still doing enough?  Are  our  current\r\n\r\nphilosophy of what we are doing and the policies correct, not\r\n\r\nonly  for  the short or immediate term, but also in the  long\r\n\r\nterm?  Do we need to take stock of what we are doing now  and\r\n\r\nexamine them in the light of environmental sustainability  in\r\n\r\nthe longer term?  Perhaps, the Acting Minister will enligthen\r\n\r\nus on these concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, I also have a suggestion for him. It is\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  we  human are the people  who  pollute  our\r\n\r\nenvironment  and, therefore, for long-term sustainability  to\r\n\r\nwork,  there must be plans to make us pollute less.  So  far,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the policies to make us pollute less are  based  on\r\n\r\npunishment.   I put it forward that they have not  been  very\r\n\r\neffective.  Just look at our anti-littering laws and our anti-littering  campaigns.  After so many years, it is  still  not\r\n\r\neffective.   Just  take a look at the  place  after  a  major\r\n\r\nevent,  litter  is  all  over the place.   I  dare  say  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is kept litter-free by the street cleaners, and not\r\n\r\nbecause there are no litter bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the real long-term solution is to inculcate good\r\n\r\nenvironmental  behaviour as part of  our  habits.   For  such\r\n\r\nbehaviour to be habit-forming, we must start ingraining  such\r\n\r\nbehaviour into our children from a very young age by  mothers\r\n\r\nat  home  to  be reinforced in kindergartens and  schools  by\r\n\r\nteachers.  Sir, I suggest that we start with the mothers.   I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the  Acting Minister that  he  will  succeed  in\r\n\r\ninfluencing latter generations to be environmental caring  as\r\n\r\nmany  of  our social and behavioral values are imparted  from\r\n\r\nour mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, over the last 35 years, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas    successfully    coped   with   the    challenges    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and urbanisation and, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nprovided  a  healthy  environment for  Singaporeans.   Today,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  renowned as a Garden City with a well-designed\r\n\r\nland-use   plan   and   a  comprehensive  and   sophisticated\r\n\r\nenvironmental infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1992, the Environment Ministry prepared \"The\r\n\r\nSingapore Green Plan - Towards a Model Green City\" to adopt a\r\n\r\nfresh  approach towards environmental management.  The  Green\r\n\r\nPlan  aims to address global environmental concerns, such  as\r\n\r\nglobal  warming, protection of the ozone layer,  preservation\r\n\r\nof  biodiversity  and endangered species  and  prevention  of\r\n\r\npollution  of  the  seas.   The Green  Plan  also  identified\r\n\r\nstrategic  directions with Action Programmes and targets  for\r\n\r\nspecific areas and sectors.  In this regard,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  hope the Environment Minister can update the House on  the\r\n\r\ntargets  achieved so far, and future environmental management\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following clarifications to make:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the progress made in \"The Singapore Green\r\n\r\nPlan\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Has the Ministry managed to build environmental\r\n\r\nconsciousness   among  Singaporeans?   What   are   the   key\r\n\r\nbenchmarks and indicators?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) How many firms have developed corporate\r\n\r\nresponsibility  towards environmental management?   What  are\r\n\r\nthe successful programmes or initiatives implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Is there any review to improve the environmental\r\n\r\naudit in Singapore?  Has such audit increased business cost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak on the review of the Green Plan and the Rio+10 process.\r\n\r\nIf I may, though, can my first point be to confess that I was\r\n\r\nidentified by the World Economic Forum as a Global Leader  of\r\n\r\nTomorrow.  I am a member of the task force that produced  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  sustainability index that other  Members  have\r\n\r\nreferred  to.  I joined this task force late and I, too,  was\r\n\r\nsurprised at its conclusions.  I have given my inputs to  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  by  email but I have been unable to  attend  their\r\n\r\nmeetings and full deliberations because of other commitments,\r\n\r\nincluding the sitting of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that sense, I start off by saying I believe that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  a  generally  good  record  in  environmental\r\n\r\nprotection.   This  is especially in the  case  of  pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol,  the  so-called \"brown\" issues, which  explains  the\r\n\r\nPERC  report  Mr  Heng Chiang Meng referred  to.   In  nature\r\n\r\nconservation,  though, on the \"green\"  issues,  some  believe\r\n\r\nthere  are  shortcomings, and many of these result  from  the\r\n\r\nintensity  of population and land use in Singapore which  are\r\n\r\ninescapable, given our size.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  sense, my own belief is that some environmental studies\r\n\r\nwill  always  rank us lower than we think,  because  of  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  sustainability, the peculiar  circumstances  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and its geography, and of population density.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let me come to my second point. This is that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  look  forward to opportunities  to  engage  the\r\n\r\ninternational community, to explain to them our strong points\r\n\r\nand,  also,  to  accept  their  criticism  of  some  of   our\r\n\r\nshortcomings, and learn to improve.  That is why I  bring  up\r\n\r\nthe  review of the Green Plan and the Rio+10 process because,\r\n\r\nin  the  coming  year, 2002, there will be  an  international\r\n\r\nreview  of the 1992 Earth Summit that was held in  Rio.   The\r\n\r\nnew  meeting  will  be held in South Africa.   Singapore  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  a Green Plan and is now coming up to a review  of\r\n\r\nthat  Plan, and I would like to ask the Acting Minister  what\r\n\r\nis the progress of that review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that I hope that, against this\r\n\r\nbackground, in undertaking this review, the Government  would\r\n\r\nbe open and self-critical.  There are some suggestions in the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1992&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Plan that have not been fully taken up, and  they\r\n\r\ndeserve to be considered anew.  There are also areas  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  upon.   In  some  cases,  technologies,  like  power\r\n\r\ngeneration,  waste treatment, and alternative energy  sources\r\n\r\nlike  solar power, have improved considerably in the last  10\r\n\r\nyears,  and we have to ask if we are making full optimal  use\r\n\r\nof these improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is that, in coming up to this review and a\r\n\r\nreview  of our national Green Plan, I would ask the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto make a concerted effort to engage civic groups and experts\r\n\r\nin  the process.  Many have already served in drawing up  our\r\n\r\ndraft  recommendations, but more can  be  involved  when  the\r\n\r\nplans  are  openly reviewed, if indeed they  will  be  openly\r\n\r\nreviewed.  Consultation and participation are good  ways  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  get  citizen  feedback,  they  also  help  them  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the constraints and concerns the Government feels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is that I would ask Singapore to\r\n\r\nparticipate  early and strongly in the global review  of  the\r\n\r\nRio+10  process.   We are a small island  and  vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nchanges in the environment of our neighbours, or the world as\r\n\r\na whole.  We should, therefore, pay attention not just to our\r\n\r\nenvironmental record here in Singapore, but the world's,  and\r\n\r\nplay  our  part  as  a  steward of the  common  environmental\r\n\r\nheritage  of  the world.  This should involve  not  just  our\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies or civic groups and experts.  Rather,  we\r\n\r\nshould use this opportunity to reach out to the international\r\n\r\ncommunity.   A  national committee can  be  formed  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose, and it could serve to communicate and cooperate with\r\n\r\nother  countries on these areas of common concern.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to   ask   the  Minister  if  he  would  seize   these\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  reach out to explain to the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity, and fully participate in the efforts to  make  the\r\n\r\nworld a better place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the Members\r\n\r\nfor addressing the issues of environmental sustainability and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Green Plan.  In my response, I will  touch  on\r\n\r\nthe broader aspect of sustainability.  I will not go into the\r\n\r\ndetails in some specific areas, so as not to pre-empt Members\r\n\r\nwho will be speaking on these specific areas in the remaining\r\n\r\ncuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr Kenneth Chen and Mr Heng\r\n\r\nChiang  Meng  mentioned  the  ranking  in  the  Environmental\r\n\r\nSustainability  Index (ESI).  As Mr Heng has said,  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  city-state, a country with a small land area,  a  city\r\n\r\nthat  is densely populated, and we live in a highly urbanised\r\n\r\nenvironment.   We see busy traffic every day.  We  also  have\r\n\r\nindustries  which are highly competitive and export-oriented,\r\n\r\naccounting  for more than 20% of our GDP.  Some  people,  who\r\n\r\nare  not  familiar  with developments  in  Singapore,  expect\r\n\r\nSingapore  to face problems of polluted air, water and  land.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same time, they expect Singapore to face  a  serious\r\n\r\nthreat,   of  living  near  the  threshold  of  environmental\r\n\r\ndisaster.  Indeed, this is the assessment of the ESI,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nranking Singapore as the 9th worst in the world, in terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  danger  of  living near the threshold  of  environmental\r\n\r\ndisaster, as mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality is that today, in Singapore, we still\r\n\r\nenjoy  clean  air, water and living environment.   With  100%\r\n\r\nmodern  sanitation for every household, refuse collected  and\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  daily, the incidence of food-borne, water-borne\r\n\r\nand  vector-borne disease is low.  We are able to  stay  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  threshold of environmental disaster  because,  all\r\n\r\nthese   years,  we  have  been  able  to  harness  technology\r\n\r\ncreatively  and  effectively.  At  the  same  time,  we  have\r\n\r\napplied   our  minds  innovatively  to  protect  our   living\r\n\r\nenvironment  with a great sense of commitment, responsibility\r\n\r\nand  social discipline.  Take the last 10 years, for example.\r\n\r\nAs  Dr  Teo  Ho Pin has mentioned, we published the Singapore\r\n\r\nGreen  Plan  (SGP), and this is our blueprint  for  a  \"model\r\n\r\ngreen city\".  Dr Teo asked for the progress of the SGP.   Six\r\n\r\nworking  committees  were formed to implement  six  areas  of\r\n\r\naction.   They formulated 133 action programmes,  which  were\r\n\r\npublished  in  November 1993, and they have been  implemented\r\n\r\nover the last 8-9 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, due to time constraints, I will not go into the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  all aspects of progress.  I will just  highlight\r\n\r\nsome  of  them as an illustration of the kind of progress  we\r\n\r\nhave  made.   For  example,  in  the  area  of  environmental\r\n\r\neducation,  we  started  a Council for  the  Environment  for\r\n\r\nTertiary Institutions.  There are now Environmental Clubs and\r\n\r\nenvironmental educational advisors in schools, and the  media\r\n\r\ncontinue to give publicity and coverage to issues relating to\r\n\r\nthe  environment.   Last  year,  the  Clean  and  Green  Week\r\n\r\nreceived  the support of 28 private sector organisations,  71\r\n\r\nGROs, 14 NGOs and more than 125,000 Singaporeans took part in\r\n\r\nthe   various  activities.   In  the  area  of  environmental\r\n\r\ntechnology,  in  fact,  Singapore has  played  host  to  many\r\n\r\nregional  forums, workshops, and exhibitions on environmental\r\n\r\ntechnology.  We send and receive many trade missions.  At the\r\n\r\nsame time, we have set up the Environmental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology  Institute (ETI) at the NTU, to support  and  help\r\n\r\nstart-up ET companies.  In the area of resource conservation,\r\n\r\nwe introduced the accelerated depreciation scheme for energy-efficient  technology.  We promoted recyling of  wastes.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, our power plant implemented the combined cycle\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of environmental audit, mentioned by Dr Teo\r\n\r\nHo  Pin, I am pleased to say that, of the 930 companies which\r\n\r\nhave a potential to pollute the environment, in fact, 230  of\r\n\r\nthem have gained the certification of ISO 14001.  This is  up\r\n\r\nfrom  14  before  1992.  So we see a marked increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  companies  putting  in  place  the  environmental\r\n\r\ntechnology   management  system.   In  the  area   of   clean\r\n\r\ntechnology, we saw the additional supply of natural gas  into\r\n\r\nSingapore;  the  introduction  of  unleaded  petrol  for  all\r\n\r\nvehicles  since July 1998; the introduction of lower  sulphur\r\n\r\ndiesel  of  0.05% by weight in March 1999; and the tightening\r\n\r\nof emission standards for industries and vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of nature conservation mentioned by Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay,  I  believe  the Minister for National  Development  has\r\n\r\nmentioned in the Committee of Supply that MND is now studying\r\n\r\nthe recommendations supported by the focus group.  I think he\r\n\r\nalso said that nature sites will be preserved for as long  as\r\n\r\nthey are not needed for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of noise control, in fact, ENV has\r\n\r\nintroduced  new regulations to control noise from  industrial\r\n\r\npremises.  At the same time, we have implemented a network of\r\n\r\n21 stations to monitor ambient noise in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, we have made good progress in the\r\n\r\nlast  10  years, but we will not stop there.  Next  year,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be publishing the SGP for the next 10 years.  Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay  asked  whether  we will continue to  involve  the  civic\r\n\r\norganisations and so on.  I assure him that in the review  of\r\n\r\nthe  SGP, we will invite the private and public sectors,  and\r\n\r\nNGOs,  to be jointly involved in the review of the SGP.   Our\r\n\r\naim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to  get  it ready in time for release at the  Rio+10,  so\r\n\r\nthat,  as  Mr  Simon  Tay  has mentioned,  we  can  keep  the\r\n\r\ninternational community up-to-date on what we  have  done  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At the same time, to share with them our plan and\r\n\r\nvision for the next 10 years and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also suggested that Singapore should\r\n\r\nparticipate  actively  in  the  Rio+10  Summit,  and  that  a\r\n\r\nnational  committee should be formed, to make  sure  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  come  up with an appropriate response to capitalise  on\r\n\r\nthe Rio+10 Summit as an opportunity.  Sir, I fully agree with\r\n\r\nMr  Simon Tay.  In fact, we did participate very actively  in\r\n\r\nthe  1992  Rio Summit, and we intend to continue to  be  very\r\n\r\nactive  in Rio+10.  Just like what we did for the Rio Summit,\r\n\r\nwe intend to set up an Inter-Ministerial committee to prepare\r\n\r\nfor  Rio+10.   At the same time, we will involve the  private\r\n\r\nand public sectors and the NGOs in the whole process, so that\r\n\r\nby the time of the Rio+10 meeting in South Africa, we will be\r\n\r\nable to present a concerted response from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng and Mr Kenneth Chen asked what\r\n\r\nare  ENV's views on the various rankings, and whether we have\r\n\r\nsought  clarification  from the  World  Economic  Forum.   As\r\n\r\nmentioned by some Members, if we were to look at the issue of\r\n\r\nsustainability  from  a  natural  endowment  point  of  view,\r\n\r\nobviously, Singapore would be ranked lowly because we  are  a\r\n\r\nsmall country with no natural endowment.  We have conveyed to\r\n\r\nESI  of  the World Economic Forum that the sustainability  of\r\n\r\nany  environment  goes  far  beyond  natural  endowment.   We\r\n\r\nconveyed to them that with creativity, commitment and the use\r\n\r\nof   technology,   we  can  push  back   the   threshold   of\r\n\r\nenvironmental disaster, as in the case of Singapore.  ESI, in\r\n\r\nresponse,  recognised our performance up to  now.   In  their\r\n\r\nreply,  they  said that in terms of environmental  regulation\r\n\r\nand  management, they rank Singapore as the 5th best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   In  the  area of global cooperation,  activeness  in\r\n\r\nparticipation  in global movements and so on,  they  rank  us\r\n\r\namong the top 25% in the world.  In the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narea of environmental health, they rank us as amongst the top\r\n\r\n33%.   In  the first final report published early this  year,\r\n\r\nthey have reviewed the position of Singapore.  Instead of No.\r\n\r\n9  from  the bottom, they have moved us up to 65th  position,\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the middle.  Obviously, this is not good enough.\r\n\r\nWe  will continue to work on our strategy for sustainability,\r\n\r\nand  continue  to explain to the global community,  including\r\n\r\nESI, so that they can understand better what we have done and\r\n\r\nwhat we will continue to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, our challenge in environmental management\r\n\r\nis  to  protect  and enhance our living environment,  not  by\r\n\r\nslowing  down  economic growth to reduce energy and  resource\r\n\r\nconsumption.   If  we do that, we may well  be  living  in  a\r\n\r\ncleaner  environment, but we will all be poorer off.  Rather,\r\n\r\nwe are going to do it by maximising efficiency and minimising\r\n\r\nwastage,  as  commented by some Members.  This is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  continued  economic  growth  and  improvement   in\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living are not achieved at the expense  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Our twin objectives, basically, are to continue\r\n\r\nto  enhance  performance in the short term and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, strengthen the sustainability for the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay and Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked what\r\n\r\nour  strategies  for sustainability are, and whether  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing enough, have we taken stock and what more will be done.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  pleased  to report to the  House  that  we  have\r\n\r\nreviewed our current strategies.  We have also met with  many\r\n\r\nof  our  partners in the past few months, including  the  GPC\r\n\r\nmembers  who  are  here  today, the Environmental  Management\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Singapore (EMAS), professional  associations\r\n\r\nsuch   as   SIA   and  IES,  staff  unions,   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConfederation of Industries, the Association of Lorry Owners,\r\n\r\nBus Owners and Travel Agents, the recyclers, the Pest Control\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore, the Singapore Sanitary and Plumbing\r\n\r\nAssociation, as well as the GMs of the Town Councils.   After\r\n\r\ntaking  into account their feedback and suggestions, we  have\r\n\r\nupdated   the   overall   framework   for   performance   and\r\n\r\nsustainability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Clerk to distribute a table. I am not\r\n\r\nsure  whether you have it.  If not, I will make sure you have\r\n\r\nit  after this.  I will highlight some of the key features in\r\n\r\nthis  particular  table.  Sir, the environment  is  a  closed\r\n\r\nloop.   What  goes up must come down, and what goes  in  must\r\n\r\ncome out.  In the new economy, we talk about end-to-end.   In\r\n\r\nthe case of environment management, we have decided to go one\r\n\r\nstep further.  We are not just talking about end-to-end,  but\r\n\r\nalso  tying the two ends together, what we call \"closing  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental loop\".  Let me highlight some of  the  concepts\r\n\r\nin  the tying of this environmental loop.  Take, for example,\r\n\r\nclean air.  We recognise that more energy will be consumed by\r\n\r\nfactories,  offices and households.  At  the  same  time,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise that there will be more vehicles on the road.   For\r\n\r\nsustainability, we can close the energy loop, and this  means\r\n\r\nthat we will continue to tighten control on emission but,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we also switch faster to cleaner energy  and\r\n\r\nstep  up energy conservation, a point made by Prof. Low  Seow\r\n\r\nChay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term target, over the next 10 years at least,\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that the air quality in Singapore will continue\r\n\r\nto stay within the US EPA and the World Health Organisation's\r\n\r\nclean air standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of clean land, based on current trend, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  build  a new incineration plant every  five  years.\r\n\r\nEvery  30 years, we need to find a place the size of  Sentosa\r\n\r\nIsland  for  landfill.  To  achieve sustainability,  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  close the solid waste loop. This means  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  ensure the proper collection and disposal of waste but,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, we will pursue the 4Rs more pro-actively,\r\n\r\nas  recommended by Prof. Low Seow Chay. These 4Rs are  reuse,\r\n\r\nreduce,  recycle  and  recover.  We  will  also  give  higher\r\n\r\npriority  to the development of the recycling industry.   Our\r\n\r\naim is to make Singapore a centre of excellence in 4Rs in the\r\n\r\nAsia Pacific.  Right now, 40% of the solid waste generated in\r\n\r\nSingapore  every  day is being recycled.  Over  the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears, our target is to increase it to 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clean water, today we supply about 300 mgd of clean\r\n\r\nwater for a population of about four million.  In the future,\r\n\r\nwe will need to supply more clean water to meet the need of a\r\n\r\ngrowing   population  and  a  growing  economy.   To  enhance\r\n\r\nsustainability in the supply of clean water, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  tap  on  existing  sources of supply,  such  as  rainfall\r\n\r\ncollection, water from Malaysia and, at the same  time,  look\r\n\r\nfor  new  supplies,  for  example,  from  Indonesia,  through\r\n\r\ndesalination and so on.  We will also pursue the core concept\r\n\r\nof  closing the water loop.  This means that we will  reclaim\r\n\r\nused  water to produce high grade clean water, known  as  the\r\n\r\nNewater.   This  is why we have decided to  merge  the  Water\r\n\r\nDepartment,   the  Drainage  Department  and   the   Sewerage\r\n\r\nDepartment to form the new PUB.  This is, of course,  subject\r\n\r\nto  legislative approval by this House tomorrow.  Our  target\r\n\r\nover  the  next 10 years is to increase the rate of recycling\r\n\r\nof  used water from the present 5% to 20% through the use  of\r\n\r\nNewater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of safe food, we are seeing the re-emergence\r\n\r\nof diseases that could affect food supply, for example, Nipah\r\n\r\nvirus,  mad cow disease, foot and mouth disease. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  the world is also facing new uncertainty brought about\r\n\r\nby  advances  in  life  sciences,  for  example,  genetically\r\n\r\nmodified food.  To ensure food safety, we need to monitor and\r\n\r\nmanage  the  entire food value chain. This  means  having  to\r\n\r\nmonitor development in external farms and controlling imports\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary.  At the same time, we have to ensure  proper\r\n\r\nprocessing,  handling, storage, distribution and  consumption\r\n\r\nof  these  foods in Singapore.  We also need to forge  closer\r\n\r\ncollaboration between ENV and AVA and relevant agencies.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, closer collaboration between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nvarious  regional and international agencies.    Our  target,\r\n\r\nover  the  next 10 years, is to avoid any massive  food-borne\r\n\r\ndisease outbreaks in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of infectious diseases, we see recent\r\n\r\nemergence of infectious diseases in other parts of the world,\r\n\r\nfor  example, Avian flu, Hantavirus and so on.  We  also  see\r\n\r\nthe re-emergence of diseases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  malaria, dengue and Legionnaires' disease.  Coupled\r\n\r\nwith  the  greater  cross  border  movement  of  people   for\r\n\r\nemployment,  holidays, business, etc, we  have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  we could only keep the risk  of  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases  low in Singapore, firstly, by upgrading  our  local\r\n\r\ncapabilities  to deal with these diseases and,  secondly,  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  regional cooperation as well as to  forge  closer\r\n\r\ninternational collaboration because diseases know no national\r\n\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are the World Health Organisation's\r\n\r\nCollaborating  Centre for Environmental Epidemiology  in  the\r\n\r\nWestern  Pacific region.  We are also recognised as a leading\r\n\r\ncountry  in  vector control by the World Health Organisation.\r\n\r\nOur  target  over  the next 10 years is to become  a  leading\r\n\r\nresearch  and management centre for communicable  disease  in\r\n\r\nthe Asia-Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On living environment, we have kept Singapore clean and\r\n\r\ngreen  by  spending  a lot of money and employing  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncleaners  and, at the same time, issuing a lot of  fines,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  one  of  the Members.  Looking  ahead  towards\r\n\r\nsustainability, I agree fully with the Member that we  should\r\n\r\nstrive  to become a country where every citizen and  resident\r\n\r\nwill play his or her part to care for, and to take pride  in,\r\n\r\nour living  environment.  We will step up public education to\r\n\r\ninstill  civic-mindedness in our people.  We  will  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  active citizenry and strengthen the 3P partnership - the\r\n\r\npeople,  public  and  private sector  partnership,  including\r\n\r\nmothers, as suggested by Mr Heng Chiang Meng, so as  to  make\r\n\r\n\"keeping  Singapore  clean and green\" our  daily  habit,  our\r\n\r\ndaily desire and our way of life.  Our target, over the  next\r\n\r\n10 years, is that we want to be a clean, green and fine city,\r\n\r\nbut not a city of fines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these outcomes in environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability, ENV will reinvent itself.  We will  build  on\r\n\r\nour current strength and, at the same time, strive to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  even better by being more innovative, more responsive and\r\n\r\nbetter  in  learning in a fast changing world.  Our intention\r\n\r\nis  to  restructure  ENV into a Ministry  with  a  very  lean\r\n\r\nheadquarters,  with  possibly three statutory  boards.  These\r\n\r\nare,  firstly, the new PUB, which is effectively the national\r\n\r\nwater  authority to take charge of clean water.   The  second\r\n\r\nstatutory  board will be the Environmental Health  Agency  to\r\n\r\ntake  charge  of safe food, vector control and public  health\r\n\r\nrelating   to   infectious  diseases.    And   thirdly,   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Protection Agency which will  take  charge  of\r\n\r\nclean  air  and clean land.  This will not happen  overnight.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to achieve this over the next 18-24 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have outlined this evening is a broad\r\n\r\nframework,   aimed   at   enhancing   our   performance    in\r\n\r\nenvironmental protection in the short term and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  sustaining  our environment to support  the  long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our economy and society.  This is version 1.0.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not cast in concrete.  We will continue the process\r\n\r\nof  consultation  with the 3P sectors.  We  believe  that  by\r\n\r\nputting  our heads together and working together, we can  not\r\n\r\nonly  protect our environment for today, make it  better  for\r\n\r\ntomorrow, but also sustain it for generations to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, point of clarification.

I  wonder whether the Ministry can  provide  more\r\n\r\nsupport  to  help the schools to outreach to more  pupils  to\r\n\r\ndevelop this passion to protect the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I thank Dr Teo Ho Pin for his very\r\n\r\ngood  suggestion.

Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next topic I would\r\n\r\nlike to talk about is Newater.  Years ago, I spoke about  the\r\n\r\npossibility of recycling some of our domestic used water  for\r\n\r\nreuse and suggested that the domestic sewers be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseparated from the industrial sewers for the purpose of water\r\n\r\nrecycling without industrial contamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, Members of Parliament were invited by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment to visit the Newater plant  which\r\n\r\nrecycles water for reuse.  We all note with surprise  that  a\r\n\r\nmodernised  water factory, producing huge volumes of  crystal\r\n\r\nclear  water  has already materialised.  We  were  told  that\r\n\r\nlarge  quantities of water were piped into the  golf  courses\r\n\r\nfor  watering of the grass and whatever excess from the plant\r\n\r\nis thrown into the sea.  What a waste!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the cost and quality of\r\n\r\nNewater.  Is it safe for drinking?  What infrastructure do we\r\n\r\nneed  to  deliver Newater to the end user? Sir, the  idea  of\r\n\r\nusing  micro-filtration and low pressure reverse osmosis  for\r\n\r\nbrackish water was heard of many years ago. Is the technology\r\n\r\nused  for  the Newater plant considered to be a technological\r\n\r\nbreakthrough?  If  so,  what is it?   As  we  know  that  the\r\n\r\nmembrane  technology evolves very rapidly  in  the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears,  if we invest heavily in this way in producing  water,\r\n\r\nhow  could  we  be  sure  that  our  water  plant  could   be\r\n\r\nevolutionary?  What is the strategy adopted to keep  in  pace\r\n\r\nwith  water  technology  development  which  is  evolving  so\r\n\r\nrapidly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is importing water from our neighbours. This\r\n\r\nNewater  initiative  offers us a means to  reduce  our  water\r\n\r\ndependency on outside supply.  Theoretically, if the price is\r\n\r\nright,  we should produce as much water as we need.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe long-term objective, in terms of product quantity and the\r\n\r\napplications  of  Newater?  The low pressure reverse  osmosis\r\n\r\nfor  brackish  water depends on the type of membranes  chosen\r\n\r\nand  the  system design.  We are able to obtain  even  higher\r\n\r\nquality  of  water than the PUB water that  we  consume  now.\r\n\r\nThere should be no doubt at all that one day, Newater will be\r\n\r\nserved as potable water.  I would like to ask, in case  of  a\r\n\r\nwater shortage emergency, could Newater be consumed as normal\r\n\r\ndrinking  water?  Are there plans to educate  the  public  to\r\n\r\naccept Newater as an alternative to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotable  water?   Newater is produced through a high pressure\r\n\r\nprocess, and energy is needed.  The cost of producing Newater\r\n\r\nwill  be  higher than that of the conventional filtration  of\r\n\r\nraw  clean  water.  If we are able to secure  sufficient  raw\r\n\r\nwater  supplies,  it does not sound very sensible,  from  the\r\n\r\neconomic  point of view, to put our Newater plant running  at\r\n\r\nfull  load.  If we could purchase cheaper water elsewhere  in\r\n\r\nsufficient  quantities, accept the lower cost in future,  how\r\n\r\ndo we deal with the excess Newater plant capacity that we are\r\n\r\ngoing to build?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low pressure reverse osmosis for Newater operates at\r\n\r\npressure  of  one-tenth  of that of  the  sea  water  reverse\r\n\r\nosmosis.  In other words, the desalination of sea water  will\r\n\r\nbe  many  times higher in cost as compared with  the  reverse\r\n\r\nosmosis  for  the  Newater plant.  If  Newater  is  a  viable\r\n\r\nalternative water source, what is the role of the more costly\r\n\r\nsea  water  desalination?   Are we  planning  to  shelve  the\r\n\r\ndesalination  plan which has been under review  for  quite  a\r\n\r\nwhile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, water is precious.\r\n\r\nWe  should educate and inculcate in our people the message of\r\n\r\nsaving  every drop of water and not wasting water.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  bulk  of water we use in  our  daily  lives  is\r\n\r\ndependent  on  the supply from our neighbouring  country.  In\r\n\r\n2060, when our water agreement with Malaysia expires, we  may\r\n\r\nface  some problems.   Although there are still some 60 years\r\n\r\nto  go,  we cannot wait until then before we take any action.\r\n\r\nWe must be fully prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government has started the ball rolling. We embarked\r\n\r\non  an  experimental  project on  desalination  and  we  also\r\n\r\ncommenced  to  recycle our waste water.  I am very  glad  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment has finally announced  that  our\r\n\r\nNewater  project  is  a success.  The  birth  of  Newater  is\r\n\r\nexciting  and  this technological breakthrough is  indeed  an\r\n\r\nhonour  to Singapore.  This may well be the solution and  new\r\n\r\nhope  to  our  water  supply  problem,  and  may  reduce  our\r\n\r\ndependence on our neighbouring countries for the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the difference\r\n\r\nbetween the Newater and the desalinated water in terms of the\r\n\r\ncost   of  processing.    Secondly,  the  Ministry   of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  said  that there is a possibility  that  Newater\r\n\r\ncould  be potable. Has there been any evidence, so far,  that\r\n\r\nthis  Newater  could  be used for drinking  and  whether  any\r\n\r\nexperiment  has been conducted in, say, the zoo or  the  bird\r\n\r\npark?   With the advance in technology, will the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment  consider Prof. Low Seow  Chay's  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  this  Newater  be  bottled  and  sold  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For the information of Members, the\r\n\r\nperson chairing the proceedings in the Committee is addressed\r\n\r\nas Chairman, and not as Deputy Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I did address you as\r\n\r\nChairman.

May I know when the project  will  be  on\r\n\r\nstream, ie, producing water ready for potable use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by some friends, who have had experience\r\n\r\ndrinking desalinated water in the Middle East, that the taste\r\n\r\nwill  not be to the liking of Singaporeans, to say the least.\r\n\r\nAs  I have not drunk desalinated water, I do not know what it\r\n\r\ntastes  like.

Will  it  be\r\n\r\npiped  directly to the homes from the plants, or will  it  be\r\n\r\nmixed  with our traditional sources of potable water?  Surely\r\n\r\nif  people are apprehensive of drinking Newater, if they  can\r\n\r\nbe  mixed  with  our  traditional sources  of  water  in  the\r\n\r\nreservoirs,   perhaps  this  will  overcome   some   of   the\r\n\r\npsychological barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I would like to ask is what about\r\n\r\nthe  other  sources  of  water,  such  as  water  from  other\r\n\r\nMalaysian states and Indonesia.  We heard some time ago about\r\n\r\nthese  plans, but since then we have heard nothing much about\r\n\r\nthem.  Could the Acting Minister tell us the current status?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at the present moment, we\r\n\r\nare  relying quite heavily on water supply from Malaysia,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore land mass is small and catchment of  rainwater\r\n\r\nis  limited  to a few existing reservoirs.

With today's technology,\r\n\r\nreclaiming  waste water has become a very viable  alternative\r\n\r\nsource of water supply.  The setting up of our Newater  plant\r\n\r\nhas  proved that waste water can be recyled to produce  clean\r\n\r\nwater to the quality even higher than that of the present PUB\r\n\r\nstandard.   With  the  completion  of  deep  tunnel  sewerage\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  quantity  of  waste  water  collection  can  be\r\n\r\nincreased  tremendously and therefore our recycled water  can\r\n\r\nbe increased correspondingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only today it was reported that the cost of desalination\r\n\r\nis  about  one-third of what it was 10 years ago, and  it  is\r\n\r\nstill falling.  With the setting up of our first desalination\r\n\r\nplant  to desalinate sea water into usable water, it is hoped\r\n\r\nthat  our  reliance on foreign water source would be  greatly\r\n\r\nreduced, as we face constant threat of supply being  cut  off\r\n\r\nby our neighbour.  I would like to ask the Minister to update\r\n\r\nus  on the current as well as the medium term of water supply\r\n\r\nsituation  when all our initiatives for increasing our  water\r\n\r\nsupply are realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all these additional sources of water\r\n\r\nsupply,  I  think  we  should not ignore  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nlimiting water wastage.  Recently, there seems to be a let up\r\n\r\non  the effort made to press home the importance of the  save\r\n\r\nwater  message  to the public.  As the demand and  supply  of\r\n\r\nwater  is  interlinked, and while we can  ensure  more  water\r\n\r\nsupply  in  the future, it is equally important to limit  the\r\n\r\ndemand  as  much  as we can now.  I would  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  not to relent on reminding the general  public  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  limiting wastage of  water.   Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\npressure of ever increasing the demand can never be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I thank Members for speaking on\r\n\r\nthis  subject  of  Newater.   I would  like  to  organise  my\r\n\r\nresponse  in  a certain sequence.  Firstly, I would  like  to\r\n\r\naddress  what is Newater, because Prof. Low Seow  Chay  asked\r\n\r\nwhether is this a technological breakthrough, is it something\r\n\r\nnew.   Let  me put it this way.  Right now, we consume  about\r\n\r\n300 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngallons  of water every day.

We\r\n\r\nconsume  about  300 million gallons every day and  output  is\r\n\r\nalso 300 million gallons every day, and we treat every single\r\n\r\ndrop  of this used water.  Today, only 5% of this used  water\r\n\r\nis recycled as industrial water.  The other 95% is discharged\r\n\r\ninto  the  sea.   But  with  the  advances  in  the  membrane\r\n\r\ntechnology, we are saying that instead of discharging it into\r\n\r\nthe sea, why not reclaim the water, because we can now do  so\r\n\r\nvery cost effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we do it? Basically, through three stages.\r\n\r\nThe  first step is to take the water through what we  call  a\r\n\r\nprocess of micro filtration.  In so doing, we remove the very\r\n\r\nsmall  solids  down  to the size of 0.2  micron.   This  will\r\n\r\nfilter out, for example, bacteria.  After the first stage  of\r\n\r\nmicro  filtration, we move on to the second  stage  known  as\r\n\r\nreverse  osmosis.   This is to remove the remaining  viruses.\r\n\r\nThese are the smallest living organisms, down to the size  of\r\n\r\n1,000th  of  a micron.  After that, we put the water  through\r\n\r\nultraviolet, as a safeguard, to sterilise the water.  And the\r\n\r\noutput is high grade water which we call Newater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect is the cost of this Newater resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  technology breakthrough.  Prof. Low Seow Chay, Mr  Heng\r\n\r\nChiang  Meng and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked about the cost.   Let\r\n\r\nme clarify.  The membrane technology is not new.  It has been\r\n\r\naround  for  a  long,  long time.   In  fact,  this  membrane\r\n\r\ntechnology has been used in the USA, Australia, UK and France\r\n\r\nto  reclaim water for years.  So we are not the first in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   But  what  is new is that today,  this  membrane  is\r\n\r\nthinner  and more durable.  In the past, the membrane  needed\r\n\r\nto be replaced every three years.  Now, we need to do so only\r\n\r\nonce  every five years.  Because the membrane is thinner,  we\r\n\r\nare  able  to  push through water through the  membrane,  the\r\n\r\nprocess of reverse osmosis, at a much reduced water pressure.\r\n\r\nThis reduction in water pressure is about 50%, because of the\r\n\r\nthinness   of  the  membrane.   As  a  result,   the   energy\r\n\r\nrequirement has come down.  The cost of Newater is  therefore\r\n\r\nmuch cheaper now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  because  of this, it has now become a viable  source  of\r\n\r\nclean water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cost of Newater compared to desalination is\r\n\r\nvery much lower.  Why, you may ask?  After all, they use  the\r\n\r\nsame  membrane for desalination and Newater.  Why then is  it\r\n\r\ncheaper to produce Newater?  This is because used water has a\r\n\r\nlower total dissolved solid compared to sea water.  Sea water\r\n\r\nhas  much  higher  salt content.  So to push  the  sea  water\r\n\r\nthrough  the  membrane, you will need to  apply  much  higher\r\n\r\npressure,  and  pressure  comes from  energy.   That  is  why\r\n\r\ndesalinated  water  is  much  more  expensive,  compared   to\r\n\r\nNewater.   But  on  the  whole, we can  expect  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndesalination and Newater to continue to decline, as  membrane\r\n\r\ntechnology continues to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third aspect of the question\r\n\r\nraised  by the Members, which is, where are we today.   Prof.\r\n\r\nLow  Seow  Chay and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked about the quality,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  safe to drink and whether we have  conducted\r\n\r\ntests.   Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested why don't we bottle  this\r\n\r\nNewater  and  sell  it as mineral water.  Today,  we  have  a\r\n\r\ndemonstration  plant producing 10 thousand  cubic  metres  of\r\n\r\nNewater every day.  This is equivalent to 2.2 million gallons\r\n\r\nof water per day.  This plant was commissioned in May 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay wondered why do we supply this water\r\n\r\nto  golf courses and throw it away into the sea.  The purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  demonstration plant is for us to convince ourselves\r\n\r\nthat the process does work, and that the quality of the water\r\n\r\ndoes  meet with our expectations.  And I am happy to say that\r\n\r\nwe  have conducted tests covering the physical, chemical  and\r\n\r\nmicro  biological  analysis.  So far, the test  results  show\r\n\r\nthat the standard is well within drinking water standard  set\r\n\r\nby the WHO, the USEPA and the EU.  In short, the water indeed\r\n\r\nis safe for human consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then are we not drinking it today? Sir, if we were\r\n\r\nto look at the overall water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupply  situation,  I  wish to make the  point  that  in  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable  future, there is no need for us  to  talk  about\r\n\r\nconvincing  members  of the public to  consume  the  Newater.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because,  at this moment, there is a growing  industry\r\n\r\nknown  as the wafer fabrication industry.  Over the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears  or so, our aim is to have 25 wafer fabrication  plants\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  And together, they require about  55  million\r\n\r\ngallons per day (mgd) of ultra clean water.  This 55  mgd  is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  15%  of  our  daily  consumption  of   water.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  our point here is this:  Even though the  Newater\r\n\r\nis  ultra  clean water, there is no need, at this moment,  to\r\n\r\nthink  about  human consumption, because  there  is  a  ready\r\n\r\nmarket  which is willing to pay good money for this  Newater.\r\n\r\nI  think  it  makes a lot of sense, from the  standpoint   of\r\n\r\nmatching  supply  and demand for us to  take  the  wafer  fab\r\n\r\nindustry  that  requires high grade water  as  the  immediate\r\n\r\npriority for the consumption of Newater.  Indeed this is what\r\n\r\nwe are doing.  We aim to achieve a 15% consumption of Newater\r\n\r\nby  the  year  2010, about 55 mgd.  This will be supplied  to\r\n\r\nwafer fab plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is our immediate plan? Mr Heng Chiang Meng\r\n\r\nasked how we intend to pipe it to the homes.  Sir, as I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned,  there  is no need to pipe Newater  to  the  homes\r\n\r\nbecause,  in  the  foreseeable future, we are  talking  about\r\n\r\nsupplying this water to the wafer fab plants.  It makes a lot\r\n\r\nof  sense to supply Newater to wafer fab plants because these\r\n\r\n25  wafer  fab  plants are not scattered all over  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  are  located  centrally at three wafer  fab  parks,  at\r\n\r\nWoodlands,  Tampines  and  Pasir  Ris,  and  they  are   high\r\n\r\nconsumption  customers.  As a result,  we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsupply  this  Newater to these 25  wafer fab  plants  in  the\r\n\r\nthree wafer fab parks in a highly cost effective manner.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  our assessment is that we will be able to supply  this\r\n\r\nNewater to them even cheaper than what they are paying  today\r\n\r\nfor  potable  water.  In a way, this is a win-win  situation,\r\n\r\nbecause we are now able to make full use of the Newater  and,\r\n\r\nat  the same time, the industry will be able to achieve  some\r\n\r\nkind of cost savings through the use of Newater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked when are we going to build\r\n\r\nthese new plants.  Sir, we are now in the process of building\r\n\r\ntwo Newater plants, each with a 5 mgd capacity.  They will be\r\n\r\nlocated  at  Bedok  and Kranji Sewage Treatment  Works.   The\r\n\r\ntender  for  consultants  has been called  this  month.   The\r\n\r\ntender  for  the supplying of pipeline will be  called  later\r\n\r\nthis  year.  Our target is to commission both plants  by  the\r\n\r\nend of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members also asked about our long-term plans,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of quantity and application, whether we  will  now\r\n\r\nhave  a situation of having excess Newater, whether we  still\r\n\r\nneed to have desalination, whether we still need to buy water\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia,  and  so on.  Let me put this  discussion  in\r\n\r\nproper perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newater is to reclaim used water. The technology of\r\n\r\nNewater  cannot  create  water  but  it  can  reclaim  water.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  for  the system to work, you look  at  the  water\r\n\r\nsystem in Singapore as a whole system.  If there is no  water\r\n\r\ninput into the system, Newater cannot work because there will\r\n\r\nbe  no water to reclaim.  In other words, we need to continue\r\n\r\nto   inject  water  into  the  water  system  either  through\r\n\r\ncollection  of  rainfall  or taking water  from  Malaysia  or\r\n\r\nthrough  desalination, so that water reclamation can continue\r\n\r\nto  work.   What we are saying is that over a longer  period,\r\n\r\nwith a bigger population, we may not be able to secure enough\r\n\r\nwater  supply on a perpetual basis.  What this means is  that\r\n\r\nby  investing  in Newater technology, we are now  applying  a\r\n\r\nmultiplier factor into the system.  Take, for example, if  we\r\n\r\nare  able  to  reclaim 20% of the water  used  in  our  water\r\n\r\nsystem,  we  will  be able to enhance the capacity  of  clean\r\n\r\nwater by 25%.  If we are able to increase this reclaimed rate\r\n\r\nto 40%, we will be able to enhance the capacity by 67%.  What\r\n\r\nthis  means  is  that  every drop of water  we  collect  from\r\n\r\nrainfall,  import  from  Malaysia, maybe  from  Indonesia  or\r\n\r\nthrough desalination, we will be able to use a drop of  water\r\n\r\nmore than once.  In that way, we make sure that Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe long term, not just the next  20, 50\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears, but maybe the next 500, 1,000 years, will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to maximise every single drop of water coming  into\r\n\r\nthe water system to make sure that we will always have enough\r\n\r\nwater for the economy, the society and the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked what if Malaysia were to cut off\r\n\r\nwater  supply.  Sir, I do not think this would happen because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a water agreement honoured by both sides for  many\r\n\r\nyears.   Water  supply beyond 2061, in  fact,  is  now  being\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  as you have heard from the Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs.  So let me emphasise again that the whole purpose of\r\n\r\nNewater  is  to  add  to  the security  of  water  supply  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but it is not our intention to be self-sufficient\r\n\r\nas far as the water supply is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked how do we intend to keep pace with\r\n\r\nthe  technology.  What we are doing basically is to  continue\r\n\r\nto  work  closely  with the suppliers and  the  other  users,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind that we are not the only user in the world of\r\n\r\nthe  membrane technology.  We will continue to keep in  touch\r\n\r\nwith  them  and  share experience regarding the  use  of  the\r\n\r\ntechnology.    Whenever  there is a promising  solution,  our\r\n\r\nintention is to conduct a pilot project, just like the way we\r\n\r\nhave  done so with Newater.  In this way, hopefully, we  will\r\n\r\nbe able to continue to keep ourselves up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether we have any plan to educate\r\n\r\nthe  public.   Mr Kenneth Chen also emphasised  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to promote the message of water conservation.   Yes,\r\n\r\nI  agree with both of them.  In fact, we intend to set up the\r\n\r\nNewater Visitors Centre at Bedok centre - this would be ready\r\n\r\nby  March  next  year  -  so  that  members  of  the  public,\r\n\r\ngrassroots  members, students, and so on, can be  brought  to\r\n\r\nthe  plant, so that at least they get to know more about  the\r\n\r\nquality of water and the technology that we are deploying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed most, if not\r\n\r\nall, of the concerns raised by Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, on global warming,\r\n\r\ncarbon  dioxide  is  one  of the most significant  greenhouse\r\n\r\ngases  that  causes global warming due to the amount  of  its\r\n\r\nemission.   The under-developed and the developing  countries\r\n\r\npointed fingers to the developed countries for causing global\r\n\r\nwarming  and  asked the developed countries to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nclean-up  and  subsequent  cost  of  the  control  of  future\r\n\r\ngreenhouse  gas  emission.   Singapore  is  not  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsignatories of the World Climate Conference and is  also  not\r\n\r\nclassified  as  a  developed  country.   We  still  have  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to satisfy our conscience  as  a  responsible\r\n\r\nworld  citizen.   There are many things  we  could  do  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  world  citizen  regarding  the  greenhouse   gas\r\n\r\nemission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister about the measures we\r\n\r\nare taking to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All carbons containing fuel generate greenhouse gases\r\n\r\nafter  combustion.  Do we have plans to encourage the use  of\r\n\r\nalternate fuel with lower carbon contents?  It is possible to\r\n\r\nreplace heavy diesel by light diesel, gasoline by methanol or\r\n\r\nethanol,  normal  liquid fuel by LPG and  natural  gas.   The\r\n\r\nrecent  private  attempt of testing  the  idea  of  replacing\r\n\r\ndiesel engines in buses by compressed natural gas is a viable\r\n\r\nproject  towards  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  take  action in helping  and  encouraging\r\n\r\nthis  kind of project.  We should also try to revise some  of\r\n\r\nour  rules  and  regulations to make  sure  that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nobstruct  greenhouse gas-friendly projects by the  supply  of\r\n\r\ngreenhouse gas-friendly fuel, vehicles or equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement of energy conversion efficiency will also\r\n\r\nallow  the reduction of greenhouse gases from every  unit  of\r\n\r\nenergy  which  is generated.  We should try to encourage  the\r\n\r\nreplacement of certain prime mover engines, power  generators\r\n\r\nwhich have poorer overall energy efficiency.  Purely from the\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency point of view, say, for example, a  diesel\r\n\r\ncar will be more efficient than a gasoline-driven car, though\r\n\r\nit may create some unwanted pollutive problems.  An electric\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicle  will  be  more  efficient than  a  gasoline  vehicle\r\n\r\nbecause  the power generation plant that supplies  energy  to\r\n\r\nthe electric vehicle is more efficient than a gasoline engine\r\n\r\nrunning   on  the  road.   Should  the  Government  lay   the\r\n\r\ngroundwork, like rules and regulations, for the people to try\r\n\r\nout  the  various energy efficient vehicles or  cars  on  the\r\n\r\nroads?  For example, should we have rules and regulations  or\r\n\r\nincentives  for  the  people who try out  electric  vehicles,\r\n\r\nnewer type of prime movers for vehicles, like the CNG vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich  has not been tried out in Singapore (but it is an  old\r\n\r\ntechnology favourable to the environment), fuel-cell  powered\r\n\r\nvehicles which are going to be launched, cylinder or gasoline\r\n\r\ninjection vehicles which are already in the market?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for all these vehicles, if we have some sort of rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations or incentives to encourage the promotion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  use,  certainly we are working towards the improvement\r\n\r\nin our effort towards the reduction of greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incineration of solid waste may be a better alternative\r\n\r\nthan landfills because we are a land scarce nation.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  incineration  of solid waste leads to  the  emission  of\r\n\r\ngreenhouse  gases  and without very well utilisation  of  the\r\n\r\nheat  generated because of the composition of the wet garbage\r\n\r\nand  the combustion process.  We should adopt strategies like\r\n\r\nwaste  minimisation  so as to allow a  higher  percentage  of\r\n\r\nwastes  to  be  recovered and change the people's  habits  of\r\n\r\ngenerating wet garbage.  One of the ways of reducing  garbage\r\n\r\ngeneration is to charge garbage for collection by weight.   I\r\n\r\nheard that the Ministry has some proposals sometime ago.  But\r\n\r\ndid  the  Ministry seriously consider charging collection  of\r\n\r\ngarbage by weight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also educate the people on the use of things like\r\n\r\nbiodegradable  products,  for  example,  biodegradable  bags,\r\n\r\ninstead  of using all the PVC products.  The recent  call  by\r\n\r\nthe NGOs to use less PVC carrying bags for shopping is one of\r\n\r\nthe  programmes which is worth supporting.  Is the Government\r\n\r\nplanning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   carry   out  an  education  programme  in  schools,   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with the Ministry of Education, to  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople on waste minimisation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using polyfoam disposable cutlery in canteens and hawker\r\n\r\ncentres is one of the greenhouse gas-unfriendly policies.  On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, we had launched it many years ago  to  reduce\r\n\r\ndependence  on  foreign workers, and  also  it  may  be  more\r\n\r\nhygienic  in food handling; on the other hand, the disposable\r\n\r\ncutlery  will be eventually incinerated which could  lead  to\r\n\r\nthe emission of greenhouse gases.  If we still have a choice,\r\n\r\nwe  should  consider abandoning the idea of using  disposable\r\n\r\ncutlery for the sake of reducing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, in an effort to initiate a green\r\n\r\nrevolution of Singapore roads, the Government is offering OMV\r\n\r\nrebates and road tax incentives to encourage car owners to go\r\n\r\ngreen.  This kind of encouragement would help to bring  about\r\n\r\ngreater  conservation of natural resources and  result  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter  living  environment for all of us.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge the Ministry of the Environment to go a step further  to\r\n\r\nconsider  tax  rebates and financial incentives to  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  environmentally-friendly technologies  for  the\r\n\r\nproduction of electricity, whether on a wide scale  by  power\r\n\r\nstations or locally by some producers of electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the tropics with abundant sunshine. Solar\r\n\r\ncell panels are one obvious example that deserves more of our\r\n\r\nattention.   We  have heard earlier in the debate  that  such\r\n\r\ntechnology  is costly.  But with greater usage, according  to\r\n\r\nsome  industry  sources, the capital cost and maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  hardware  and  equipment can be  reduced  substantially.\r\n\r\nWith  the proper amount of incentives, I believe more  people\r\n\r\nwill   use   solar  cell  panels  to  supplement  electricity\r\n\r\nconsumption.  This will in turn encourage more people  to  do\r\n\r\nresearch  to  develop  better and more affordable  equipment.\r\n\r\nThis  may even lead to technological breakthroughs,  just  as\r\n\r\nreported in the Straits Times today on the low radiation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmobile phones developed by a Government-funded research  body\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to ask the Ministry on our\r\n\r\nefforts   to  address  future  Indonesian  fires   and   haze\r\n\r\npollution.  I want to make some suggestions on what we  might\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you would remember that in 1997 and 1998, Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  region experienced a very dense and prolonged  haze\r\n\r\npollution, resulting from fires mostly in Indonesia.  What is\r\n\r\nof  more  concern  for the present and future  is  that  some\r\n\r\nscientists predict that we will experience another dry spell,\r\n\r\nanother  El  Nino, in 2001 or perhaps 2002.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  timely to ask the Ministry what  steps  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken since 1997 and 1998, and whether what has been done  is\r\n\r\nenough  to  prevent another terrible time of smoke  and  fire\r\n\r\nwhere we can hardly see the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has agreed to many action plans to address the\r\n\r\nissue.  But it is not clear to me whether these actions  have\r\n\r\nactually  been  taken or whether they just remain  as  plans.\r\n\r\nAction  plans  are  often more plans  than  actions.   Recent\r\n\r\nreports are that Indonesian laws are now placing a burden  on\r\n\r\nlandowners to quell fires.  This is hoped to help prove  that\r\n\r\nthey  started  the  fire.  But will  the  Minister  give  his\r\n\r\nopinion on the chances of successful implementation of  these\r\n\r\nplans?   I  ask because there are a few reports of successful\r\n\r\nprosecutions  of  fire-starters and the companies  they  work\r\n\r\nfor.   I  also  ask because I realise the many  problems  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  today face in their country, and that  they  may\r\n\r\nlack attention and resources to deal with the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three suggestions on what we might do to\r\n\r\nhelp Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I know that we presently offer satellite images.\r\n\r\nI  wish  us  to  go  beyond this.  I  wish  us  to  encourage\r\n\r\nIndonesia to do more.  First, by working with provincial  and\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities.   Recently, Indonesia  has  passed  wide-reaching laws to devolve more authority in many matters  from\r\n\r\nJakarta to the provinces.  These provinces, however may  lack\r\n\r\nthe capacity and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention to problems such as the environment and  fires.   I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  the  Ministry to look towards working  more  with\r\n\r\nthem, especially provinces in Riau and Sumatra, which are  so\r\n\r\nnear us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would ask, now that Indonesia has passed\r\n\r\nlaws  for  the prevention of fires, whether we could consider\r\n\r\nmaking these laws enforceable in our courts.  Many Indonesian\r\n\r\ncompanies trade through Singapore or have assets and  offices\r\n\r\nhere.   Many Indonesian businessmen pass through our airport.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore  not impossible that  some  of  the  guilty\r\n\r\nparties  come  to or through Singapore.  If we can  therefore\r\n\r\nidentify  and  prosecute them, we would help  supplement  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the  Indonesian  government  against  these  law\r\n\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would encourage a prudential approach to\r\n\r\nlending  and trading from Singapore.  We are a financial  hub\r\n\r\nand  a  trading  centre for many of the industries  involved,\r\n\r\nincluding   oil  palm  and  timber.   It  is  the  commercial\r\n\r\nundertakings  that  use  fire to clear  land  because  it  is\r\n\r\ncheaper.   Would the Ministry advise Singapore-based  lenders\r\n\r\nand traders to make due enquiries of their Indonesian clients\r\n\r\nand partners?  Where they demonstrably do not cause fires, we\r\n\r\nshould prefer these Indonesian clients.  Where they have,  on\r\n\r\nthe  reverse, broken laws against the use of fire, is it  not\r\n\r\nincumbent on our lenders and Singapore business community not\r\n\r\nto be complicit in these crimes and observe Indonesian law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make these suggestions because it is not just\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  suffers, but the first  victims  are  indeed\r\n\r\nIndonesians  who  live much nearer and amidst  the  fire  and\r\n\r\nsmoke.   I would therefore ask the Ministry concerned how  we\r\n\r\ncan  proactively try to avoid the next El Nino occurrence  by\r\n\r\naddressing these fundamental commercial causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority (LTA) is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntasked with the checking of vehicles which emit black exhaust\r\n\r\nsmoke,  and  the offenders will be detected by  some  special\r\n\r\ngadget used by the LTA and booked for the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop an offender and fine him on the spot is the most\r\n\r\nconvincing  way of establishing the fact that an offence  has\r\n\r\nbeen  committed.  However, this would cause a  delay  in  the\r\n\r\ntransporting  of  goods  by  the vehicle  involved,  and  may\r\n\r\npossibly cause a traffic jam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule against emission of black smoke by vehicles is\r\n\r\nenforced  by  the  Environment Ministry  officials.    A  new\r\n\r\nmethod is now being used.  A latest  high-tech camera is  now\r\n\r\nused to detect the smoke emitted from the moving vehicles  on\r\n\r\nthe  road.   If  the smoke emitted is in excess  of  what  is\r\n\r\npermitted  under the law, the vehicle owner will  be  booked.\r\n\r\nHow  accurate  can  the camera be in determining  whether  an\r\n\r\noffence has been committed? Can the photographs taken by this\r\n\r\ncamera be admissible as evidence in court?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some drivers told me that the Environment Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  would normally hide themselves near a  slope,  and\r\n\r\ntake  photographs of these vehicles when they  are  ascending\r\n\r\nthe  slope.   When  a heavy vehicle, such as  a  fully-loaded\r\n\r\nlorry,  goes  up the slope, it is natural for the  driver  to\r\n\r\nstep harder on the accelerator, resulting in more black smoke\r\n\r\nbeing emitted from the exhaust pipe.  Will the Ministry allow\r\n\r\nthese drivers who have been booked to go to the office of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry  to  view these  photographs,  free  of\r\n\r\ncharge  (I  emphasise: free of charge), to satisfy themselves\r\n\r\nthat they had indeed committed the offence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about those foreign vehicles? Many drivers told me\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry officials only booked local vehicles,  but\r\n\r\nno  enforcement action is taken against heavy vehicles coming\r\n\r\nfrom  other  countries. Is it true that foreign vehicles  are\r\n\r\nnot dealt with for such similar offences? If so, why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the air\r\n\r\nquality in Singapore is good.  We monitor very closely a  few\r\n\r\nkey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npollutants.   These  are  sulphur dioxide,  carbon  monoxide,\r\n\r\nnitrogen oxide, ozone and the particulate matter, both,  what\r\n\r\nwe  call,  PM  10 and PM 2.5, depending on the  size  of  the\r\n\r\nparticulates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these air pollutants are well within\r\n\r\ninternational limit for clean air determined by  the  US  EPA\r\n\r\nand the World Health Organisation.  My Ministry will continue\r\n\r\nto  monitor the quality of the air to make sure that it  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to stay within this limit.  But having  said  that,\r\n\r\nthere  are  two  air pollutants which my Ministry  is  paying\r\n\r\nextra attention because the level of pollution is on the rise\r\n\r\nand  we could reach the limit in the near future.  These  are\r\n\r\nSO2 and particulate matter.  Basically, the three sources  of\r\n\r\npollution are - vehicles, industries and power generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have touched on the issue of\r\n\r\nvehicular pollution.  Prof. Low Seow Chay asked when  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do  more to put in place rules and regulations  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can try out more energy efficient vehicles, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  CNG and the fuel cell vehicles.  Mr Ang Mong Seng  asked\r\n\r\nabout  enforcement operations, appeal procedures, and so  on,\r\n\r\nand  also  enforcement on foreign vehicles, mainly  Malaysian\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Sir, vehicular pollution accounts for 50%  of  the\r\n\r\nparticulate matters.  50% of all the dark smoke, and  so  on,\r\n\r\ncomes  from  the vehicle.  Our top priority is to reduce  the\r\n\r\nemission  of particulate matter, generated mostly  by  diesel\r\n\r\nvehicles - buses, taxis, lorries, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We deploy a set of strategies to contain such emissions.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  impose very stringent emission standards.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  have upgraded the emission standards  for  SO2,\r\n\r\nparticulate   matter,  carbon  monoxide   and   the   unburnt\r\n\r\nhydrocarbon  regularly.   On  1st  January  this   year,   we\r\n\r\nintroduced the Euro II emission standards to make sure  that,\r\n\r\nover  time, it will get better.  The second strategy we  have\r\n\r\ndeployed so far is the introduction of low sulphur diesel  to\r\n\r\nreduce  both  the SO2 emission and the particulate  emission.\r\n\r\nSince  March 1999, which is about two years ago,  sulphur  in\r\n\r\ndiesel has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduced to 0.05%, in terms of weight, and over time,  we  may\r\n\r\neven  look at the ultra-low sulphur diesel which will  be  as\r\n\r\nlow as 0.01%, when the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our third strategy is very much the point brought\r\n\r\nup  by  Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng,  ie, enforcement  against  smoky\r\n\r\nvehicles.   There is no point having very stringent standards\r\n\r\nif we do not enforce these standards.  As mentioned by Mr Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng,  in the past, enforcement on the spot did  create\r\n\r\nsome  problems for other motor vehicles.  So in August  1999,\r\n\r\nmy Ministry decided to make use of digital video cameras.  We\r\n\r\nsited  these cameras in certain locations.  Each time, if  we\r\n\r\nsee  a  vehicle emitting black smoke which is highly visible,\r\n\r\nwe would take a recording.  The recording is then transmitted\r\n\r\nback  to  the Ministry headquarters where some of  my  senior\r\n\r\nofficials  will  sit  in front of the  PC  and  look  at  the\r\n\r\nrecording.   They will then make a determination  on  whether\r\n\r\nthat  particular  offender ought to be let off,  or  given  a\r\n\r\nwarning letter, or indeed given a fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked, firstly, whether these photos\r\n\r\nare  reliable.   Sir, these are not photos.  These  are  real\r\n\r\nvideo,  moving pictures.  So you can see a vehicle moving  on\r\n\r\nthe  road and you see all the black smoke coming out.  So the\r\n\r\nreliability  is  not an issue because what you  see  is  what\r\n\r\nactually happened on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether this evidence is\r\n\r\nadmissible in court.  Sir, I do not know.  So far,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nno  offender, having seen the video, has decided  to  contest\r\n\r\nus.   Because when they see the video, they will see all  the\r\n\r\nblack  smoke coming out, and they put up their hand and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I admit I ought to be fined.\"  So far, we do not have a\r\n\r\nsingle  case in which somebody, after looking at  the  video,\r\n\r\nstill maintains that he or she is innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether we locate those video\r\n\r\ncameras at up slope.  Sir, I can assure him that this is  not\r\n\r\nthe  case.  Because if you were to look at the video, you can\r\n\r\nsee  very  clearly whether the car is moving horizontally  or\r\n\r\nmoving uphill.  I can assure him that there is not a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingle  case of offence involving a vehicle moving up  slope.\r\n\r\nI  am very sure about this because my officials gave me their\r\n\r\nassurance  on this.  In fact, when I looked at  some  of  the\r\n\r\nvideos  myself, I was convinced that the emission was  really\r\n\r\nbad.   It was certainly more than 50-70 HSU because the black\r\n\r\nsmoke was so clearly visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng made a very good point. He asked\r\n\r\nwhether we will allow free inspection of these videos.  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to say, yes.  Indeed, this is the practice.   When  an\r\n\r\noffender receives a notice of offence from us, he is  welcome\r\n\r\nto come to ENV to have a cup of coffee, look at the video and\r\n\r\nconvince himself whether he wants to contest the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng also asked whether our enforcement\r\n\r\naction is applicable to foreign vehicles.  By that, I presume\r\n\r\nhe  is  referring to Malaysian vehicles.  Let me  share  with\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House  on what we  have  done,  as  far  as\r\n\r\nMalaysian  vehicles are concerned.  Malaysian  vehicles  with\r\n\r\nblack  smoke emission exceeding 70 HSU (Hartridge Smoke Unit)\r\n\r\n-  I am told it is the measurement of smoke - are turned back\r\n\r\nto Malaysia.  We do not even want to fine them and allow them\r\n\r\nto  pollute  our air.  We tell them, \"Your case  is  so  bad.\r\n\r\nPlease make a U-turn and go back.\"  For those between 50  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HSU, yes, it is an offence but not too excessive.  We will\r\n\r\ngive  them a compounded fine on the spot because, after that,\r\n\r\nwe would not know where to find them.  For the first offence,\r\n\r\nthey  are  fined $150; second offence is $300 and  subsequent\r\n\r\noffence  is  $500.   Many of them do take  corrective  action\r\n\r\nafter  the first offence because it is not cheap to pay  $300\r\n\r\nand $500 for emission of black smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the enforcement action effective? I think so,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  number of bookings has been on the  rise.   For\r\n\r\nSingapore vehicles, five years ago, in 1996, we booked  6,900\r\n\r\ncases and, last year, it had gone up to 16,000.  In the  case\r\n\r\nof Malaysian vehicles, we see the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease from 3,500, five years ago, to 9,100 last year.   So\r\n\r\nyou  can see that we are serious about enforcement, and as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this enforcement action taken by my Ministry,  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of smoky vehicles, as a percentage of  the  total\r\n\r\npopulation,  has  come down.  We conduct random  survey.   We\r\n\r\nstation  officers  at certain locations and  they  count  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  vehicles  going past and the number  of  vehicles\r\n\r\nemitting black smoke and they compute the percentage of smoky\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, among the Singapore vehicles, 4% were smoky\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Last year, it dropped to 1.1%.  So we are seeing a\r\n\r\nsignificant  drop  of 4% to 1.1%.  In the case  of  Malaysian\r\n\r\nvehicles, the decline is even more dramatic, from 16.2%, five\r\n\r\nyears ago, to 3.9% last year, which means that many vehicles,\r\n\r\nboth Singaporean vehicles and Malaysian vehicles, are getting\r\n\r\nthe  message  that we are indeed serious with our enforcement\r\n\r\naction  and  that  more vehicles are now not committing  this\r\n\r\noffence of emitting black smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the tightening of the emission standards and\r\n\r\nenforcement  will  go  some way in  helping  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nvehicular pollution will not get worse or get out of control.\r\n\r\nBut  we  think at the same time, we ought to look for a  more\r\n\r\nsustainable  solution,  which  is  the  conversion  to  green\r\n\r\nvehicle.  This is the point brought up by Prof. Low Seow Chay\r\n\r\nas  well as a few other Members.  Prof. Low asked what  plans\r\n\r\ndo  we have to speed up the deployment of CNG and whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  any  incentive  schemes in place to  encourage  company\r\n\r\nowners, and so on, to replace their inefficient vehicles with\r\n\r\nvehicles which are more energy efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has looked at the five types of green\r\n\r\nvehicles. These are electric vehicles, liquid petroleum  gas,\r\n\r\nfuel  cell  vehicle, hybrid vehicles and  natural  gas.   Our\r\n\r\nassessment,  at  this moment, not cast in  concrete  because,\r\n\r\nover  time,  things will change - is that the mass deployment\r\n\r\nof  electric  vehicles, at least in the short  term,  may  be\r\n\r\nlimited  by  the recharging mechanism.  This is because  they\r\n\r\nneed to be charged overnight at a recharging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacility.  I think it will take some time before we can  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  network  implemented.  So the role of  the  electric\r\n\r\nvehicle may be hampered by this lack of infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as LPG vehicles are concerned, my Ministry, in\r\n\r\nfact, has decided not to promote LPG, because of the risk  of\r\n\r\nfire  and  explosion.  So we are not going  to  promote  LPG,\r\n\r\nunless there is a breakthrough in the technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area mentioned by Prof Low is the fuel cell\r\n\r\nvehicle.   I agree with him that the fuel cell vehicle  holds\r\n\r\ngreat  promise.  In fact, of the five types of  vehicle,  the\r\n\r\nfuel  cell  vehicle  is the cleanest, from the  environmental\r\n\r\nstandpoint.   But  because  the  technology  is  still  at  a\r\n\r\ndevelopmental stage, what we intend to do is to  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the development and, at the right time,  to  conduct\r\n\r\npilot projects and bring them into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining two are the hybrid vehicles and the\r\n\r\nnatural  gas vehicles.  At least in the near term, these  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of green vehicle are most relevant, in the context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So far, we have introduced incentive schemes  for\r\n\r\nelectric  and hybrid vehicles, and we will see how  it  goes.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time,  my Ministry is  now  paying  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nattention to compact natural gas (CNG) vehicle.  We place CNG\r\n\r\nvehicles  high  on our priority list because, firstly,  these\r\n\r\nnatural gas vehicles emit almost no particulate matter  (PM),\r\n\r\nno SO2, very little carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.  From\r\n\r\nthe  greenhouse  point of view, they emit 20%-30%  less  CO2,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the conventional petrol or diesel vehicle.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, a natural gas vehicle is cleaner than a  hybrid\r\n\r\nvehicle.   It is more implementable, compared to the electric\r\n\r\nvehicle.  At the same time, it is safer than an LPG vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we feel that it makes a lot of sense for us\r\n\r\nto  promote natural gas vehicles in a more concerted  manner.\r\n\r\nThis  is the reason why my Ministry is now working with  SBS,\r\n\r\nSembCorp  Gas,  Volvo and Delgro, to try out 30  natural  gas\r\n\r\nbuses in Jurong by next year.  Our aim is to learn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  this pilot implementation and, from there, we can  then\r\n\r\nlook  into the action plan, to extend the use of CNG vehicles\r\n\r\nto  other  diesel vehicles, not just buses, but  also  taxis,\r\n\r\ntour buses, maybe lorries, pick-up trucks and so on.  In  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term,  we  believe that, even for  the  petrol-driven\r\n\r\npassenger vehicles, CNG is also a very relevant and promising\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next move on to industries, because they are also\r\n\r\na  major source of air pollutants.  Prof. Low Seow Chay asked\r\n\r\nabout  incineration, and whether we could do more to  promote\r\n\r\nwaste   minimisation,  in  order  to  reduce  the  need   for\r\n\r\nincineration.   Sir, I will address that  later  on  when  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the issue of solid waste disposal.  But, as  far  as\r\n\r\nindustries  are concerned, our assessment is that  industries\r\n\r\ntoday  account  for about 40% of SO2 and 20%  of  particulate\r\n\r\nmatter.  In other words, since SO2 and particulate matter are\r\n\r\nat  the top of our list of priorities, we should do something\r\n\r\ntoo  and,  therefore, in the case of industries, our priority\r\n\r\nis to continue to reduce SO2 and particulate matter emission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy basically is, firstly, to continue to\r\n\r\npromote cleaner fuels for steam and heat generation, eg,  low\r\n\r\nsulphur  fuel oil and natural gas, and this will happen  more\r\n\r\nand  more,  now  that we have additional natural  gas  supply\r\n\r\ncoming to Singapore.  Secondly, we are also promoting the use\r\n\r\nof  cleaner technologies to reduce the level of emission, eg,\r\n\r\nsulphur  recovery, so that instead of disposing  the  sulphur\r\n\r\ninto the air, we can actually recover the sulphur itself  for\r\n\r\nother  applications,  or bag filters for  particulate  matter\r\n\r\nremoval.   Thirdly, we will continue to tighten the  emission\r\n\r\nstandards  under  the  Environmental Pollution  Control  (Air\r\n\r\nImpurities)  Regulations  for particulate  matters,  nitrogen\r\n\r\noxides and carbon monoxides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third source of air pollutants is power\r\n\r\ngeneration.   It  accounts  for  60%  of  SO2  and   30%   of\r\n\r\nparticulate matters.  So our priority again is to reduce both\r\n\r\nand, in this area, basically our strategy is to encourage and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  use  of  cleaner fuel,  which  is  basically\r\n\r\nnatural gas and, at the same time, encourage the use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleaner  technology.  For example, many of our  power  plants\r\n\r\nare  now  using the combined cycle power generation  process.\r\n\r\nWe are also working on the flue gas desulphurisation.  As far\r\n\r\nas power generation is concerned, we will continue to tighten\r\n\r\nemission  standards,  so that companies  will  speed  up  the\r\n\r\nadoption of clean energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to global warming, ie, carbon dioxide\r\n\r\nemission.   Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether any action  has\r\n\r\nbeen taken to reduce emission, and Mr Ong Kian Min also asked\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  any  incentive for environmental-friendly\r\n\r\nenergy, eg, solar energy.  Sir, carbon dioxide emission comes\r\n\r\nmainly from the burning of fossil fuels.  At this moment, our\r\n\r\nguesstimate is that power generation accounts for 50% of  the\r\n\r\nCO2  emission in Singapore, industries 35%, and vehicles 13%.\r\n\r\nGiven that we are a city-state and highly industrialised,  we\r\n\r\nadmit  that, in terms of CO2 emission per capita, we  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  high side, and that it will continue to increase as  our\r\n\r\neconomy  continues to grow, etc.  While we cannot do much  to\r\n\r\ntry  to reduce CO2 per capita, there is a lot that we can do,\r\n\r\nin  terms of reducing CO2 per-million-dollar GDP.  This means\r\n\r\nthat, as we grow our GDP, we can find a more efficient way of\r\n\r\nreducing  CO2  emission,  basically  through  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nenergy use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am happy to inform the House that,\r\n\r\nstarting from 1st April 2001, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nwill take over the chairmanship of the Inter-Agency Committee\r\n\r\non  Energy  Efficiency  (IACEE).  Right  now,  the  IACEE  is\r\n\r\nchaired  by  the Ministry of National Development.   Minister\r\n\r\nMah  Bow Tan, a few weeks ago, suggested to me that ENV  take\r\n\r\nover  the  chairmanship so that we could  close  this  energy\r\n\r\nloop,  and I agreed fully with him.  We are going to continue\r\n\r\nto  push for energy efficiency and conservation and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we are going to expand the scope of the Committee\r\n\r\nto include the use of cleaner energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong Kian Min suggested that we should introduce\r\n\r\nmore incentives to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencourage  companies  and  organisations  to  adopt   cleaner\r\n\r\nenergy,  like  solar,  for  example.   We  do  administer  an\r\n\r\nincentive   programme  in  ENV  known  as   the   Accelerated\r\n\r\nDepreciation  Scheme  for  capital  expenditure  for  energy-efficient  and  energy-saving equipment to be depreciated  in\r\n\r\none  year, instead of the normal 3-year period.  So  far,  21\r\n\r\napplications  have been approved.  But, having said  that,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the House that, under the IACEE, we will continue\r\n\r\nto  examine what new incentives and additional programmes  we\r\n\r\nshould  undertake,  in order to speed up this  conversion  to\r\n\r\ncleaner  energy, as well as to improve energy efficiency  and\r\n\r\nconservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me move on to the issue of smoke haze.\r\n\r\nSir, I thank Simon Tay for bringing this up, because it is an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue.  All of us remember that in 1997,  we  went\r\n\r\nthrough  a bad spell of the regional haze.  In the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears, the weather has turned wetter and, as a result, we did\r\n\r\nnot  encounter  any serious problem with the  regional  haze.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  good news.  The bad news is  that  the  global\r\n\r\nclimate  is  changing again and, according  to  the  experts,\r\n\r\nthere  is a 30% chance that, this year, we may see the return\r\n\r\nof  El Nino.  What this means is that there is a chance  that\r\n\r\nwe may see the return of the smoke haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we been doing in the last few years? We have\r\n\r\nbeen keeping in close touch with our Indonesian counterparts,\r\n\r\nto  help  them in whatever way we can.  For example,  in  the\r\n\r\nlast 2-3 years, we have helped the Indonesian government  and\r\n\r\nsome  of  their  regional authorities, to implement  the  PSI\r\n\r\nsystem.  They now have a system to measure PSI, and are  able\r\n\r\nto  monitor  the  seriousness of the haze situation.   As  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay mentioned, we have also shared with them satellite\r\n\r\nimages.  In fact, these satellite images are accurate  up  to\r\n\r\n20  metres, ie, we are able to pinpoint the location  of  the\r\n\r\nfire,  of  the torchhead, all the way down to the nearest  20\r\n\r\nmetres.   So,  it  is very easy now to be on the  ground,  to\r\n\r\nlocate where the fire is.  At the same time, we have provided\r\n\r\nmanpower  training  to  many  of  the  Indonesian  officials,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have a training centre at ENV and, over the  last\r\n\r\nfew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears,  we have continued to take in trainees from Indonesia.\r\n\r\nOver the last six months, I have met with Dr Sony Keraf,  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Minister for the Environment,  twice  -  once  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  once in Sabah, during the ASEAN  Ministerial\r\n\r\nMeeting  on the Environment.  On both occasions, the regional\r\n\r\nsmoke haze was the No. 1 topic of our discussion.  I think Dr\r\n\r\nKeraf  is fully aware of our concern over the situation,  and\r\n\r\nhas  assured us that he would do whatever he can  to  try  to\r\n\r\naddress the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Simon Tay has mentioned, the Indonesian government\r\n\r\nhas  recently  decided to delegate more of the responsibility\r\n\r\nand  authority to the provincial governments.  In fact,  just\r\n\r\nabout  a few weeks ago, I was in Pekan Baru and met with  the\r\n\r\nGovernor of Riau, Pak Saleh, and we discussed various issues,\r\n\r\nincluding the supply of water from Riau province and  so  on.\r\n\r\nOne   of   the   issues   discussed  was   collaboration   in\r\n\r\nenvironmental  management.  Pak Saleh Djasit made  a  request\r\n\r\nfor  us  to,  firstly, help them to enhance  their  technical\r\n\r\nexpertise in pollution management and control, both  air  and\r\n\r\nriver pollution.  He has also asked us to continue to provide\r\n\r\ninformation  exchange, so that they can be kept  up  to  date\r\n\r\nwith  whatever  is  happening.  He has  also  asked  that  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to supply them with satellite images so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  continue to know exactly where the fires are.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  they have also asked us to continue  to  provide\r\n\r\nmanpower  training and this, basically, will be more  at  the\r\n\r\nprovincial  level.   We  have  responded  positively  to  his\r\n\r\nrequests.  A technical team from ENV will be in Pekan Baru in\r\n\r\nMay to work out the entire package of technical collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the Riau province.  We hope  that,  by\r\n\r\ncontinuing to work closely with the Indonesian government  in\r\n\r\nJakarta,  and with the provincial government in  Pekan  Baru,\r\n\r\nhopefully,  we will be able to do a better job together  this\r\n\r\ntime round, should we, indeed, see the return of El Nino.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked whether we could enforce\r\n\r\nIndonesian laws on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevention  of fire in Singapore courts.  Sir,  I  am  not  a\r\n\r\nlawyer, but my understanding is that between nations, we have\r\n\r\nto  respect  the  national  sovereignty  of  our  neighbours.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  not appropriate to talk  about  enforcing\r\n\r\nIndonesian law in Singapore for offences which take place  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   But what we will continue to do will  be,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, to work very closely with the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment, as well as with the provincial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked whether we could do something to\r\n\r\nadvise   Singapore-based  lenders  and  traders  to  take   a\r\n\r\nprudential  approach  towards their  Indonesian  clients  and\r\n\r\npartners.   Sir,  this  is  a very  difficult  area  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  intervene.  As Mr Simon Tay mentioned,  these\r\n\r\nare   really  financial  and  commercial  actions  taken   by\r\n\r\ncommercial  entities.  What we hope is that these  Singapore-based   lenders  and  traders,  being  responsible  corporate\r\n\r\ncitizens,   will  not  associate  themselves   with   illegal\r\n\r\npractices that are detrimental to the regional environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed most of the\r\n\r\nissues brought up by Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is almost 6.45 pm.
