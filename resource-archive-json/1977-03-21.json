This remarkable success is  evident  to\r\n\r\neveryone at home and abroad. The successful effort  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education in this respect  should  be\r\n\r\nrecognised and widely acclaimed by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I now wish to bring up a problem, also a\r\n\r\nfact,  which  is  right before us. This  concerns  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  candidates in the Government Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nexamination for the Chinese stream, who have entered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-U  I  classes. It was not until the 9th  of  March\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Education released the  list  of\r\n\r\nsuccessful  candidates  to the  various  schools.  The\r\n\r\nsuccessful  students then reported at their respective\r\n\r\nschools on the 10th of March. They attended classes on\r\n\r\n11th  of  March, but found that the first school  term\r\n\r\nended the following day, the 12th of March. They  have\r\n\r\npaid a month's school fees for only one day's tuition.\r\n\r\nWhat is the rationale behind all this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Secondary IV examination for the\r\n\r\nChinese stream was held in mid-November last year  and\r\n\r\nthe  results were released on 5th February this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  results,  unlike  in  previous  years, were  not\r\n\r\npublished  in  the press and the candidates  concerned\r\n\r\nhad  to  return to their respective schools  to  check\r\n\r\ntheir  results. The successful students were  required\r\n\r\nto  return to their respective schools on 7th, 8th and\r\n\r\n9th February to fill up the relevant application forms\r\n\r\nfor  admission  to the schools of their choice.  These\r\n\r\nforms  had  to be submitted by the various schools  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education for processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The processing is said to be done by computers and\r\n\r\nas  such, in our mind, it must be time-saving,  highly\r\n\r\nefficient  and  fast, and the newly admitted  Pre-U  I\r\n\r\nstudents should have been able to begin classes  seven\r\n\r\nor  ten days later. But, alas, they have to wait until\r\n\r\ntwo  days  before the end of the first term  to  start\r\n\r\ntheir first lesson. Just how much, may I ask, can they\r\n\r\nlearn in the circumstances? What kind of education are\r\n\r\nwe promoting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I wish to ask are firstly, the results\r\n\r\nof  the  Government Secondary IV examination  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream  were  released on  5th  February  and\r\n\r\ncompleted application forms (for admission to Pre-U I)\r\n\r\nwere  all  submitted to the Ministry for  computerised\r\n\r\nprocessing  on  9th  February.  But  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  had to drag on until 9th March  to  release\r\n\r\nthe  lists  of the newly admitted Pre-U I students  to\r\n\r\nthe various schools. What is the cause for such a long\r\n\r\ndelay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, does the Education Ministry know that much\r\n\r\nprecious time of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents had been wasted? Or was there anything  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry's administration in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nthis matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is it not a fact that the way the matter\r\n\r\nwas  handled  had  caused much precious  time  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to  be  wasted? Pre-U  I  teachers  in  many\r\n\r\nschools  had no classes to teach. Is this not a  waste\r\n\r\nof   the  taxpayers'  hard-earned  money?  Singapore's\r\n\r\npopulation is just over two million people,  and  with\r\n\r\nso   many  people  being  employed  by  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  yet  the Ministry is so inefficient  in  its\r\n\r\nwork.  If the Education departments in countries  like\r\n\r\nChina  and  the United States, with large populations,\r\n\r\nwere  to follow our Education Ministry, then it  would\r\n\r\nnot be difficult to imagine how many people would have\r\n\r\nto  be  employed.  However,  the  efficiency  and  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the  Education departments  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries are not difficult to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educating the young is a long term process and an\r\n\r\narduous task. It is the mainstay of State policy, with\r\n\r\npolitics,   national  defence,  social  and   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and communications as its  ramifications.\r\n\r\nIn  the  early 1960s Western sociologists  discovered,\r\n\r\nafter  much study and research, that education is  the\r\n\r\nmotivating force of national progress. The long  delay\r\n\r\nby our Ministry of Education in handling the admission\r\n\r\nof  Pre-U  I  students not only runs  counter  to  the\r\n\r\nguiding  principle of education but it also makes  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  guilty  of  dereliction.  I  hope  that  all\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House will take note of this.  I  also\r\n\r\nhope that the Education Ministry will pay attention to\r\n\r\nthe work of students by exercising greater supervision\r\n\r\nover  its  staff,  tightening its  administration  and\r\n\r\nraising efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer):</b> Sir, one of the\r\n\r\nmost  important instruments of national endeavour  for\r\n\r\nthe  progress  of  a  country  is  education.  Radical\r\n\r\nchanges  will be present in a country because  of  two\r\n\r\nvitally  important factors: (1) its political  system,\r\n\r\nand  (2) within which is entrenched the values of  its\r\n\r\neducation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can justly feel proud that our country's\r\n\r\neducation  policy is one of the best in the world.  It\r\n\r\nhas successfully met the demands of the nation and the\r\n\r\nworld,  particularly in this part of  the  world.  The\r\n\r\nimplementation of our education system  or  policy  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on quite smoothly, starting from 1959 with  our\r\n\r\nacceptance  of the 1956 All-Party Report  followed  by\r\n\r\nthe   1963  Lim  Tay  Boh  Report  and  the  Five-Year\r\n\r\nEducation   Development  Plan   (1966-70)   aimed   at\r\n\r\nproducing quality students rather than quantity.  1966\r\n\r\nsaw the coming into operation of the bilingual policy.\r\n\r\nIn  1968,  as  a  manifestation of  a  more  effective\r\n\r\nintegration,  integrated schools came into  existence.\r\n\r\nIn  summary  in the implementation of the first  five-year plan, 1961-65, and the second five-year plan,\r\n\r\n1966-70,   emphasis was laid on increasing the  number\r\n\r\nof secondary schools, free education, extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities,  better  teachers, adequate  paraphernalia\r\n\r\nand  spacious  buildings where academic and  technical\r\n\r\nstudents were accorded the opportunity to move  on  to\r\n\r\nPre-university or junior colleges after 1969. Students\r\n\r\nfrom vocational schools had the opportunity to proceed\r\n\r\neither  to the Singapore Vocational Institute  or  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, a programme for the restructuring of\r\n\r\nprimary  education was put forward in 1975 for reasons\r\n\r\nknown   only   to  the  authority.  The   restructured\r\n\r\neducation system, which was the result, I was told, of\r\n\r\ntwo   years'  painstaking  study,  was  rescinded  and\r\n\r\nreplaced by a system currently in force and, that  is.\r\n\r\nthe  streaming of primary schools, a move  that  gives\r\n\r\ntwo interpretations:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) firm belief in their decision for something\r\n\r\nbetter or meritorious will emerge;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) it shows for the first time that there is an\r\n\r\nabsence of \"continuity\" in the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole policy. We have made the decision. It is now our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to see that this system  works  in  the\r\n\r\nbest  possible manner. Towards this end.  I  would  be\r\n\r\nmost  grateful if the Minister could reiterate to  the\r\n\r\nHouse the criteria for the channelling of pupils, with\r\n\r\nparticular reference to Primary I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the shortage of teachers, especially\r\n\r\nEnglish language teachers, I think that while we  need\r\n\r\nteachers  from overseas it is worthwhile  to  seek  an\r\n\r\nalternative to resolve the problem. For example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) provide a re-employment scheme for retired\r\n\r\nteachers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) persuade housewives to resume employment;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) train teachers from the non-English streams,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Chinese and Malay streams,  which  are\r\n\r\nnow  in excess in that particular subject and also  in\r\n\r\nother  appropriate subjects so that  the  position  of\r\n\r\nthese teachers will become more viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meanwhile, I feel that it is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof the Ministry to monitor the response or reaction of\r\n\r\npupils  as well as teachers towards overseas  teachers\r\n\r\nand  also  their relationship with local teachers.  We\r\n\r\ncertainly  hope  that  something positive  can  emerge\r\n\r\narising from our efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of teachers has necessitated in the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of relief teachers. These relief  teachers\r\n\r\nhave  helped to tide over the lack of teachers.  Their\r\n\r\ncontributions cannot be denied. At the same  time, as\r\n\r\nan  educationist. I think we must direct  our  efforts\r\n\r\ntowards producing sufficient trained teachers at  some\r\n\r\nfuture date. In this respect, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he  has  set  any  target  date  in\r\n\r\nresolving this problem in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we interminably hear that teachers grumble when\r\n\r\nMinistry officials visit their schools. They are quite\r\n\r\nunhappy  with the attitude adopted by a few  of  these\r\n\r\nofficials. This must be checked. At the same  time,  I\r\n\r\nnotice  that last year when such visits were  made  by\r\n\r\nsenior  Ministry  officials headed  by  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary,  they were well received by principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  alike. I feel that it would be a  source  of\r\n\r\ngreat encouragement if the Hon. Minister concerned can\r\n\r\nenlighten the House as to what extent such visits have\r\n\r\nhelped  to  boost  the morale of our  teachers.  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that a good policy, a good system  executed\r\n\r\nin a proper manner, particularly with regard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  human  relationship, will  produce  more  fruitful\r\n\r\nresults. I would like to suggest that a study be  made\r\n\r\nby  the Hon. Minister of these visits, that is by  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Development Officer (EDO) and the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary.  The results will be worth  our  while  for\r\n\r\nfuture reference and guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to note that there will be a\r\n\r\npromotion exercise this year. My ardent hope  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will  pay special  attention  to  those\r\n\r\nteachers  whose  salaries, if I may  be  permitted  to\r\n\r\nborrow  the  words from the Minister for  Culture  and\r\n\r\nScience and Technology, are \"the lowest of the low\" in\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  profession. These are the teachers  who\r\n\r\nhave stagnated at lower than $1030, the maximum salary\r\n\r\nfor  an Education Officer. Group III. I earnestly hope\r\n\r\nthat these teachers could be emplaced on EO III scale.\r\n\r\nMost  of them are over 40 years old and do not possess\r\n\r\ncertain  required qualifications, but one thing  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  is that they have contributed immensely  to  the\r\n\r\nprogress of our education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, last\r\n\r\nFriday when the House adjourned there were two Members\r\n\r\nwho  spoke on this same item. This item relates to the\r\n\r\nadministration   of   the   Ministry   of   Education.\r\n\r\nEducational  administration is a  very  difficult  and\r\n\r\nsensitive  matter as it will easily arouse  criticism.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  if  the criticism is  not  proper,  then\r\n\r\nalthough the intention may be good, the result will be\r\n\r\nbad.   I   feel   that  to  do  well  in   educational\r\n\r\nadministration, it is necessary to follow what Lu-Shun\r\n\r\nhad said: that one should be stout and cool enough  to\r\n\r\nface  the criticisms of a thousand men, yet be  humble\r\n\r\nand  willing enough to serve even a child. I think  if\r\n\r\nthe  principle is practicable, then it may  yet  serve\r\n\r\nthe   purpose  somehow.  About  educational  officers,\r\n\r\nalthough   they  do  not  profess  to   be   education\r\n\r\nspecialists,  they do know a lot about education.  So,\r\n\r\nif  there is anything that the newspapers like to play\r\n\r\nup  the  result will be that the aim of such criticism\r\n\r\nis not achieved; on the contrary, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmood  of the teachers is adversely affected. Thus,  in\r\n\r\nthe end the children in our schools suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. The Member for Bedok\r\n\r\nattacked  the Ministry of Education when he  spoke  on\r\n\r\nthe estimates on the Ministry of Home Affairs. But  he\r\n\r\nforgot  to  mention in the House that he was  speaking\r\n\r\nonly  in the capacity of an MP because he was  also  a\r\n\r\nschool  principal  himself. Therefore,  the  next  day\r\n\r\nthere  was a big headline in the Straits Times to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  somebody had said that the officials  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education were not cooperative in the\r\n\r\nanti-drug  campaign,  and  that  they  even  tried  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate the efforts of the Central Narcotics Bureau.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had  any  information he should  give  me  the\r\n\r\ndetails,  that is, the name of the principal,  and  so\r\n\r\non. When he spoke of this in this House the debate was\r\n\r\non the Ministry of Home Affairs. That is why I did not\r\n\r\nreply.  The next day there was a big headline  in  the\r\n\r\npress. So the parents were confused and worried. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  mean that he cannot speak on such matters. But  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  there  are instances  of  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation officials trying to frustrate the efforts of\r\n\r\nthe   Central  Narcotics  Bureau  to  stamp  out  drug\r\n\r\naddiction.  If there is any such instance, please  let\r\n\r\nme know and I will take immediate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me answer questions raised by various\r\n\r\nMembers. The Member for Kallang appealed on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthose  disabled  children and urged  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to pay greater attention to this category of\r\n\r\nchildren.  With regard to these handicapped  children,\r\n\r\ntheir  education  has  all along  been  undertaken  by\r\n\r\nvarious voluntary organisations. They were well looked\r\n\r\nafter  by them. But it does not mean that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  does  not  concern  itself  with  their\r\n\r\nwelfare.  It  is very concerned with their educational\r\n\r\nneeds.   But   things  differ  in  their  degrees   of\r\n\r\nimportance and there is different priority with  every\r\n\r\nmatter. Up to the present time what I can say is  that\r\n\r\nthese voluntary organisations have done quite well  in\r\n\r\nlooking after the educational needs of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhandicapped children. The Education Ministry  is  also\r\n\r\nhelping  them in all possible ways. This Ministry  has\r\n\r\nsent  out  60 teachers to help these organisations  to\r\n\r\nrun  the  classes and their salaries are,  of  course,\r\n\r\npaid  by  the Ministry of Education. Apart from  this,\r\n\r\nevery  year  the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs   also\r\n\r\nprovides  grants  to  help them.  This  has  been  the\r\n\r\npolicy,  though I do not say this is an ideal  way  of\r\n\r\ndoing it. Before this question was brought up, we have\r\n\r\nalready talked with the Ministry of Finance on how  to\r\n\r\nsolve this problem and whether these classes for  such\r\n\r\nchildren  should  be  taken over by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation or whether they should be treated  as  aided\r\n\r\nschools  and assistance rendered to them as such.  But\r\n\r\nthe question is not so simple. In principle, there  is\r\n\r\nno   great   problem.   But  in  actual   fact   these\r\n\r\norganisations  are  quite  different  from  the  aided\r\n\r\nschools. So this matter requires further consultation.\r\n\r\nHis  suggestion is quite agreeable to  me  in  certain\r\n\r\naspects  and I will continue to pay attention  to  it.\r\n\r\nBut there are many ramifying problems which cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved  now  and  here.  The schools  for  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren  run by these organisations have accommodated\r\n\r\n1,126  students and we have sent out 60 teachers  to\r\n\r\nteach  in  these  classes, 22 of  whom  have  received\r\n\r\nspecialised training in educating handicapped children\r\n\r\nand   the   rest   have  received  other  professional\r\n\r\ntraining.  I  do not want to spend too  much  time  on\r\n\r\ndetails  as  there will not be enough time  to  answer\r\n\r\nother questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the various questions raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi. He talked about the Ministry's recruitment\r\n\r\nof  teachers from England and other countries and  put\r\n\r\nforward  certain  advice.  On  Friday  I  had  already\r\n\r\nclarified the postion in this regard that we would pay\r\n\r\nspecial  attention to this matter. But there  are  not\r\n\r\nmany  such  teachers, and their  number  will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to increase very much. I must stress that this\r\n\r\nis  not  the  only  way to solve the  problem  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  teachers. This is only a short  term  or\r\n\r\nmake-shift measure to solve the problem. The long-term\r\n\r\nsolution  chiefly lies in a greater intake of  trainee\r\n\r\nteachers into the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education. In  1976  the  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation  recruited a total of 547 trainee  teachers.\r\n\r\nout  of  which 272 were graduate trainee teachers  and\r\n\r\n275  were non-graduate trainee teachers. In the  first\r\n\r\nhalf of this year. 276 were recruited, out of which 115  were\r\n\r\ngraduate  trainees and 161 were  non-graduate\r\n\r\ntrainee  teachers. In July this year the Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation will take in more trainees to be trained  as\r\n\r\nteachers. This is the main counter measure. Apart from\r\n\r\nthis,  we  also  provide  an  unrestricted  number  of\r\n\r\nscholarships and bursaries for university  studies  to\r\n\r\nthose  youths  who  like  to take  up  teaching  as  a\r\n\r\nprofession.  We  have also had arrangements  with  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned in England, Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand on teacher exchange programmes so that we  can\r\n\r\nsend teachers in Mandarin in exchange for teachers  in\r\n\r\nEnglish. These are some of the measures we have  taken\r\n\r\nto solve the shortage of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about a teacher who was recently asked\r\n\r\nto   leave   Singapore, who   had   taught   in   the\r\n\r\nInternational  School,  now called  the  United  World\r\n\r\nCollege.  I would like to stress here that this  is  a\r\n\r\nprivate school. The teachers were not recruited by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education. If they were recruited  by  us.\r\n\r\nthey  would have to go through certain procedures.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   we   cannot  guarantee  that  one   or   two\r\n\r\nundesirable elements will not infiltrate our  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession.  However, this possibility is  not  great.\r\n\r\nBut  we will pay attention to his advice as to whether\r\n\r\nsuch  teachers would produce any undesirable influence\r\n\r\non our teachers and students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also enquired about the\r\n\r\nteachers' and pupils' reaction. I can say that up till\r\n\r\nnow the reaction is quite positive and favourable, and\r\n\r\nthey  have carried out their duties as teachers  quite\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi touched especially on the\r\n\r\nlowering  standard of English in schools. As a  matter\r\n\r\nof  fact,  I  have read certain reports that  even  in\r\n\r\nEngland the standard of English has gone down.  So  it\r\n\r\nis  not  just  in  Singapore. On  Friday,  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour has\r\n\r\nalso referred to a drop in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard of Chinese. It is a matter of opinion whether\r\n\r\nor  not  there is a drop in the language standard.  In\r\n\r\nthe past our forebears probably read only one book  in\r\n\r\nschool.  Therefore, they had higher demands and  could\r\n\r\nbe  very  strict  and meticulous about  the  form  and\r\n\r\ngrammar  of  the language and tolerating no  mistakes.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the modern society this has changed.  With\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  young people, their attitude  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.   They  are  quite  tolerant  of   language\r\n\r\nmistakes. The problems of examinations and others  may\r\n\r\nhave some bearing on this. But I believe the change in\r\n\r\nattitude is a crucial factor. However, we do  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  we condone a low standard of English. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  should  at least strive for a minimum standard  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the language used is not faulty,  if  not\r\n\r\nexcellent, and would be sufficient for one to  develop\r\n\r\nand build on. That is one chief reason why recently we\r\n\r\nissued circulars to schools stipulating that from 1979\r\n\r\nstudents  wishing to go to the pre-university  classes\r\n\r\nor  junior  colleges  must attain  a  certain  minimum\r\n\r\nstandard  in language. We believe that if the attitude\r\n\r\nis correct the language standard of our youths will be\r\n\r\ngradually raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem touched on by him and which was also\r\n\r\ntouched  on  by the Member for Kolam Ayer, relates  to\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers. A few of these relief  teachers  are\r\n\r\nteachers  trained by the Institute of Education.  They\r\n\r\nwill  eventually take up teaching as their profession.\r\n\r\nBut   for   the   time  being,  because   of   certain\r\n\r\nadministrative problems, these teachers  are  not  yet\r\n\r\nable  to fill up suitable posts, so they remain  where\r\n\r\nthey  are. Sometimes this is because the subjects they\r\n\r\nmastered  do not fit in with the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nschool.  This  is  only  temporary.  In  other  cases,\r\n\r\ncertain  trained teachers have given up teaching.  But\r\n\r\nin   the  meantime  because  of  good  ties  with  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  or of other reasons these teachers  do  not\r\n\r\nmind  going  back to the schools to help do  a  stint.\r\n\r\nMost of the relief teachers do not teach for long.  It\r\n\r\nis  not possible to give all of them training. I  must\r\n\r\ninform  the  House that before these  relief  teachers\r\n\r\ntake up teaching we have instructed the principals  to\r\n\r\nbrief them on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofessional guidance wherever possible, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  cope  with  the  job more  efficiently,  and  the\r\n\r\nprincipals have also complied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also touched on this\r\n\r\npoint.  He  asked  when we would stop engaging  relief\r\n\r\nteachers.  I  cannot  give  him  a  date.  Under   any\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we will need relief teachers unless  we\r\n\r\nemploy  far  more teachers whose sole  purpose  is  to\r\n\r\ntemporarily fill up vacant posts whenever the  serving\r\n\r\nteachers go on leave or fall sick. We cannot  do  that\r\n\r\nfinancially. Therefore, under these circumstances,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible to stop recruiting relief  teachers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no fixed date, in fact, the date to  stop\r\n\r\nengaging such relief teachers will be remote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the Member for Khe Bong's criticism,\r\n\r\nthis  relates to what I said just now. The speech  was\r\n\r\nfull of exaggeration. I do not deny that recently  the\r\n\r\nChinese Secondary IV students had started their school\r\n\r\nterm  late  by  five  working  days.  Last  year,  the\r\n\r\nexamination  results were announced  on  6th  February\r\n\r\n1976  and the school commenced on 1st March. This year\r\n\r\nthe  results were announced on 5th February and school\r\n\r\ncommenced on 10th March. The delay was partly  because\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese New Year holidays. This year the  time\r\n\r\ntaken  was 24 working days against 19 days last  year.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we do not want to delay and waste even a day.\r\n\r\nThe  delay  for this year was due to several  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a greater number of applicants.  Last\r\n\r\nyear  there  were 2,500 applications. This year  there\r\n\r\nwere 3,100 applications. The second reason was due  to\r\n\r\nwrongly  filled  forms. There were 500  of  them.  The\r\n\r\napplicants filled up subjects which were not  provided\r\n\r\nby the schools concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also alleged that computerised processing\r\n\r\nwas faster. I am not a computer expert but I have some\r\n\r\nknowledge about computers, because I have gone through\r\n\r\nsome  courses.  I  know  that  the  computer  is   not\r\n\r\ninfallible or cannot do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverything.  If  you  do  not  know  how  to  use  the\r\n\r\ncomputer, it cannot help you at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer can facilitate or expedite the\r\n\r\nprocessing of application forms, only if the data  and\r\n\r\nprogramming  are correct and proper. Any  delay,  even\r\n\r\nfor one day, is not good. However, we must look at  it\r\n\r\nfrom  a wider angle. I must thank him for bringing  it\r\n\r\nup  here. But if his criticism is highlighted  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  the  next day, and my answer  is  given  a\r\n\r\nsmall  space  in  the newspapers the  result  will  be\r\n\r\nmisleading.  I do not think this is his intention.  Is\r\n\r\nit?  Therefore,  although the intention  is  good  the\r\n\r\nresult may not be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer touched on several points\r\n\r\nand  I have answered some of them. He asked why before\r\n\r\nthe    restructured   education   system   was   fully\r\n\r\nimplemented it was superseded by the new system.  This\r\n\r\nrestructured education system had engaged much of  our\r\n\r\ntime  in its planning. Basically this education system\r\n\r\nwas  still  geared to the needs of average  and  above\r\n\r\naverage students. There was no provision for retention\r\n\r\nclasses.  However,  before implementing  this  system,\r\n\r\nsome  very important information had come to hand.  We\r\n\r\nfound that the automatic promotion system had produced\r\n\r\na  backward  symptom  among many students,  especially\r\n\r\nthose below average intelligence. They were very  weak\r\n\r\nin mathematics and language. They become the so-called\r\n\r\n\"educational  illiterates\".  They  could   not   speak\r\n\r\nMandarin  or English. This is a very serious  problem.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore  did  not  implement  this  restructured\r\n\r\neducation  system  but straightaway  reverted  to  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  system  with  certain  modifications   in\r\n\r\nstreaming  to  meet  educational requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nbelow-averaged. This is well-known to all and  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  ashamed  about  this. Since the  system  was  not\r\n\r\npracticable and had we persisted, it would not  be  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired how the streaming of\r\n\r\nstudents was carried out. I would stress that there is\r\n\r\nno  streaming  at  the  Primary I  level.  Because  in\r\n\r\nPrimary  I  we just take in pupils without  regard  to\r\n\r\ntheir intelligence or their capability. They are just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken in at random. There is no bio-data streaming  in\r\n\r\nPrimary  I. Actual streaming only takes place  at  the\r\n\r\nPrimary II level according to their scholastic results\r\n\r\nand  performance. If there is only one  class  in  the\r\n\r\nschool,  of  course there is no streaming. It  chiefly\r\n\r\ndepends  on the number of classes available.  It  also\r\n\r\ndepends  upon the facilities and the type of  teachers\r\n\r\nin  the  school. Basically, the streaming is dependent\r\n\r\nupon their results in mathematics and languages, first\r\n\r\nlanguage and second language, for Primary II and  III.\r\n\r\nFor  Primary IV, V and VI, science is also taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration when streaming them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also enquired whether we intended to\r\n\r\nrecruit  those teachers who had retired  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nshortage of teachers. In fact, we are doing so.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  are  good  in teaching, physically  fit  and  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to stay on, and the subjects they  teach  are\r\n\r\nthose  that we require to meet the shortage,  then  we\r\n\r\nwelcome  them back. But it sometimes happen that  they\r\n\r\ndo  not want to come back. And sometimes what they are\r\n\r\nable  to teach are not the subjects for which  we  are\r\n\r\nshort of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested whether we should employ\r\n\r\nmarried lady teachers who had given up teaching in our\r\n\r\nschools. He may be surprised to hear the figures I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to give. At present 42% of the teachers in  our\r\n\r\nschools  are married lady teachers. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the question of all married lady teachers  giving\r\n\r\nup  teaching. Actually I would like to see  more  male\r\n\r\nteachers  in the secondary schools, because  they  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with  adolescents. I think male teachers  are\r\n\r\nmore  suitable  than lady teachers for the  boys,  and\r\n\r\nvice versa for the girls. Generally boys have problems\r\n\r\nthat  require  male  teachers to  tackle  while  girls\r\n\r\nprefer lady teachers for help. So teaching should  not\r\n\r\nbe  confined  to either male or female  teachers.  The\r\n\r\npresent  trend is that the number of lady teachers  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.  There  are more and more  lady  teachers.\r\n\r\nAmong the present group of serving teachers, more than\r\n\r\n60%  are women, speaking on a national basis. Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  lady teachers are in the primary schools  where\r\n\r\nthey account for about 67%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kolam Ayer also asked whether we were\r\n\r\nretraining  those redundant Chinese and  Malay  medium\r\n\r\nteachers. Yes, we are doing this. Those who possess  a\r\n\r\ncertain  passable standard of English  will  be  given\r\n\r\nretraining,  so  that they can be  sent  to  teach  in\r\n\r\nanother  medium. Those who are not so good in  English\r\n\r\nwill  be  deployed to the type of work that  does  not\r\n\r\nrequire a high standard of English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned another point. He said\r\n\r\nthat the Education Officers' visits to schools had led\r\n\r\nto  storms of complaints and dissatisfaction among the\r\n\r\nteachers.  But when the Permanent Secretary  with  his\r\n\r\nretinue  of  administrative  officers  went  round  to\r\n\r\ncertain  schools,  he  was received  warmly.  This  is\r\n\r\nplausible. Yet not quite so. In fact, there were  both\r\n\r\nEducation   Officers   and   administrative   officers\r\n\r\naccompanying the Permanent Secretary when he made  his\r\n\r\nround  of  schools.  It was reported  once  that  some\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction and complaints had been  generated  by\r\n\r\nvisits  of professional officers to schools. But  that\r\n\r\nhad  long since been over, and I am not here defending\r\n\r\nthem.  He  should make specific references. He  should\r\n\r\nnot generalise upon some random examples, because this\r\n\r\nwould   cause   certain  anxiety  among   the   people\r\n\r\nconcerned. The purpose of the visit was to explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers and the principals the education  policy\r\n\r\nand to enhance the understanding between the teachers,\r\n\r\nprincipals and Ministry officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Secretary and his senior officials\r\n\r\nhave   visited  120  schools  to-date.  This  includes\r\n\r\nschools,  junior colleges, AEB centres and  vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes,   and   there  have  been   thorough   and\r\n\r\nharmonious discussions between the officials  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers, in arriving at a mutual understanding of the\r\n\r\npractical problems of education, with the result  that\r\n\r\nmany  forums and seminars have been conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for the benefit of the teachers.  All  these\r\n\r\nare  being done without publicity. We do not  want  to\r\n\r\ntalk  so much about it because it is not going to help\r\n\r\nin our educational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork. So we do not want to publicise our effort unless\r\n\r\nwe   have   to.  These  are  all  undertaken  quietly.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  quoted a saying by Lu Shun,  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nliteratus,  that  we  would just  carry  on  our  work\r\n\r\nquietly without pomp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chai, you have devoted a lot of\r\n\r\ntime   on   this  amendment.

I feel that he has\r\n\r\nexaggerated in his reply, because he admitted that the\r\n\r\nschool  term had started quite late this year compared\r\n\r\nto last year.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the teaching profession, the\r\n\r\nrole   of   the  Directorate  is  most  crucial.   The\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of the Directorate would  include.  I\r\n\r\nthink, the following: to define the specific duties of\r\n\r\nprimary  and  secondary school  teachers,  to  suggest\r\n\r\nimprovements in teaching methods and to create rapport\r\n\r\nbetween  the  educationists in the  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers   in   the   schools.  To   undertake   these\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  I would expect that  besides  being\r\n\r\nable  administrators, the top men in  the  Directorate\r\n\r\nshould be persons with a wealth of teaching experience\r\n\r\nand   persons  with  pleasant  personalities  who  can\r\n\r\ncommunicate  easily with the teachers  and  impart  to\r\n\r\nthem their profound knowledge on education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am certain that there are many in the\r\n\r\nMinistry who have these qualities but there are one or\r\n\r\ntwo  very senior officials who do not seem to  possess\r\n\r\nthem,  and unfortunately, the latter seem to  have  an\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the teaching profession. To  be  specific,\r\n\r\nSir, there are one or two high officials who have been\r\n\r\nfound  wanting:  they have shown by  their  deeds  and\r\n\r\nwords  that  they  are incapable  of  making  positive\r\n\r\nsuggestions  on  how teaching could be an  interesting\r\n\r\nand worthwhile profession. Instead, Sir, they seem  to\r\n\r\nhave  made  ridiculous suggestions and even humiliated\r\n\r\ncertain  teachers, and  in the  process,  created  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  anxiety and loss of morale  among  the\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I be accused of generalising, let me give\r\n\r\nyou  an illustration. There is one senior official  in\r\n\r\nthe  Directorate who has been referred to as the  D.D.\r\n\r\nTo  many teachers, it stands not for \"Deputy Director\"\r\n\r\nbut  for  other  things.

According to The Mentor, (Vol. 5.\r\n\r\nNo.  3)  the journal of the Singapore Teachers' Union,\r\n\r\nthe  D.D. has  been  quick in making  suggestions  to\r\n\r\nteachers  on  how  they should perform  their  duties;\r\n\r\nsuggestions  included the following:  teachers  should\r\n\r\ntake  turns  to go to school on Sundays,  they  should\r\n\r\nhelp  pay  school  fees, they  should  buy  their  own\r\n\r\ntextbooks,  they should eat with their  pupils  during\r\n\r\nrecess and teachers should be tested in their teaching\r\n\r\nsubjects before their own pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, there have been considerable remarks\r\n\r\nin  the  teaching community that the D.D. delights  in\r\n\r\nhumiliating,   harassing  and,   worse,   intimidating\r\n\r\nteachers, especially primary school lady teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, isolated or periodic rumours should be\r\n\r\ndismissed,  but  if they persist,  there  must  be  an\r\n\r\nelement of truth in these statements.

It\r\n\r\nappears  that many officers have reached  the  top  of\r\n\r\ntheir  salary scale and have stagnated for many years.\r\n\r\nIf  an  officer's salary has been stagnated  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  and he has still got many more years to  serve,\r\n\r\nthen  what  quality  of work can we  expect  from  the\r\n\r\nofficer?

Could the Minister give some facts\r\n\r\nand  figures of the number of officers who are in this\r\n\r\ncategory?  For this reason I know that the performance\r\n\r\nof  many officers has dropped. I suggest that a  study\r\n\r\nshould  be conducted of all the officers both  in  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service  and  the statutory bodies,  to  assess\r\n\r\ntheir capabilities and potentialities and to think  of\r\n\r\na way to emplace them on an adjusted salary scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must compliment the Government for paying the\r\n\r\nemployees of Government and statutory boards the 13th\r\n\r\nmonth   allowance.  This  is  a  step  in  the   right\r\n\r\ndirection. For a very long time the wages and salaries\r\n\r\nof  Government employees have been lower than that  of\r\n\r\nthe   private   commercial   sector.   But   what   is\r\n\r\ndisheartening is the conditions imposed on the payment\r\n\r\nof  the 13th month allowance. In order to receive this\r\n\r\nallowance, an employee should be in service up to  and\r\n\r\nincluding  31st  December of  that  year.  Many  older\r\n\r\nemployees, particularly those in Division IV, such  as\r\n\r\npostmen,  medical and health servants, school servants\r\n\r\nand  so on, did not have the date of birth written  in\r\n\r\ntheir  birth  certificates  and  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nallotted them 31st December of the year in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  they  were  born as their date  of  birth.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  the employer, retires  them  on  30th\r\n\r\nDecember because they would have passed the retirement\r\n\r\nage  on 31st December, and therefore deny them payment\r\n\r\nof  the  13th month allowance. This is grossly  unjust\r\n\r\nand  no  amount of explanation can convince any person\r\n\r\nthat  this  is not unjust. The Government also  denies\r\n\r\npayment  of  the  13th month allowance  to  those  who\r\n\r\nretire or die within the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read in the press and even heard from\r\n\r\nthe hon.

Both employees died while in service. In\r\n\r\nthe case of the HDB employee, a technician, he died on\r\n\r\n21st December, 1976\r\n\r\nInitially,  the HDB demanded the refund of his  salary\r\n\r\n22nd December, 1976\r\n\r\nthe  parents of the late employee.

Is  this\r\n\r\nreasonable?  The  man  had died  and  his  salary  had\r\n\r\nalready  been paid. They wanted to recover the  salary\r\n\r\nfrom  the  widow.  This  is  not  justified.

The TAS also demanded the refund  of  the\r\n\r\n13th month allowance from the widow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the newspaper reports, I learn that the union\r\n\r\nis  contesting the right of the employer to demand the\r\n\r\nrefund either from the parents or the widow. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  the law in this respect but I am concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe image of the Government in the eyes of the public.\r\n\r\nThe Straits Times wrote an editorial on 10th March and\r\n\r\nI  have  a copy of the editorial here. If the Minister\r\n\r\nwants it I will hand it over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang Siang Pau also Wrote an editorial which\r\n\r\nwas reproduced in the New Nation on 14th March, 1977.\r\n\r\nIn the last paragraph of their editorial they proposed\r\n\r\nthat  the  13th  month allowance  should  be  paid  in\r\n\r\nproportion  to an employee's service. I  also  have  a\r\n\r\ncopy of the editorial from Nanyang Siang Pau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I do not know of any private employer who has\r\n\r\ndenied the payment of bonus to his employees because\r\n\r\nan employee has died on 30th December and did not work\r\n\r\non 31st December, I have also not heard of any private\r\n\r\nemployer who has denied payment of bonus to an\r\n\r\nemployee who, after 30 years of service, retires or\r\n\r\ndies before 31st December. The usual practice is to\r\n\r\npay in full or on a pro rata basis. I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to seriously consider amending\r\n\r\nthe rules so that Government and statutory board\r\n\r\nemployees who retire or die in service before 31st\r\n\r\nDecember will be paid the 13th month allowance on a\r\n\r\npro rata basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, the 13th month non-pensionable annual\r\n\r\nallowance which has been given to our workers  in  the\r\n\r\npast  few years has caused some administrative problem\r\n\r\nin  the  computation of this allowance, as far as  the\r\n\r\ndaily-rated   workers  are  concerned.   This   annual\r\n\r\nallowance  is  normally paid to a worker with  certain\r\n\r\nrestrictions, like working for the whole  year  before\r\n\r\nhe  is  eligible for it. The payment is normally  made\r\n\r\ntowards  the  end of the year. Like the  monthly-rated\r\n\r\nworkers, the daily-rated workers are also paid at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, which is fair to them. But then  when  the\r\n\r\ncomputation of this allowance is made, I believe  many\r\n\r\ndepartments have a cut-off date for the calculation of\r\n\r\nthis  allowance for daily-rated workers. I  understand\r\n\r\nit  is  normally  in the middle of December.  However,\r\n\r\nafter  the payments have been made towards the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year, many daily-rated workers may be absent from\r\n\r\ntheir  place of work for various reasons, thereby  the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  deducting  proportionately  from   this\r\n\r\nallowance  comes in for those workers  who  have  been\r\n\r\naway for more than 16 days in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a department where thousands of daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers are employed, it appears that after being paid\r\n\r\nthe  13th month allowance, the authorities have to re-check the attendance of all their workers till the end\r\n\r\nof  the  year  and then make adjustments on  the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth  allowance. And when adjustments  are  made,  it\r\n\r\nmeans a recovery of their money. Sometimes, it is  not\r\n\r\nan easy business to recover the money, because some of\r\n\r\nthe  daily-rated workers may not turn up any  more  or\r\n\r\nthey   will  dispute  it  when  their  pay  is   being\r\n\r\nrecovered.  This problem has become an annual  affair.\r\n\r\nTo  simplify the payment of this 13th month allowance.\r\n\r\nI  suggest  that  those  who have  worked  up  to  and\r\n\r\nincluding  30th  November, instead of  31st  December,\r\n\r\nshould be entitled to the full eligibility of the 13th\r\n\r\nmonth allowance and that payment could be made towards\r\n\r\nthe end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P.

Minister for Finance that he would look into\r\n\r\nthe matter. He said [Hansard, Vol. 35, col. 936]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These Government regulations have a very long\r\n\r\nstanding, and perhaps they may need to be looked  into\r\n\r\nagain In the Context of our present society, while the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  still lies with the  husband  in  many\r\n\r\nhouseholds. I am not quite sure that the guideline  is\r\n\r\nstill  relevant for others  Obviously we have to  look\r\n\r\ninto   these   regulations  which  are  of  historical\r\n\r\ninterest, rather than to meet the present situation'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a full year since, and his Ministry has\r\n\r\nshown  once again a propensity for selective  amnesia.\r\n\r\nMay  I  take  this  opportunity  to  remind  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical care is provided to a Government\r\n\r\nofficer and his family at all Government hospitals and\r\n\r\nclinics - treatment is free at outpatient clinics and a\r\n\r\nnominal ward charge is levied for hospitalisation.  As\r\n\r\nlaid out in the Instruction Manual No. 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`an officer means and includes an officer or\r\n\r\npensioner of the Government of Singapore, or  a  woman\r\n\r\nofficer  who  is a widow or divorcee or who  has  been\r\n\r\ngranted  a decree of judicial separation, and  is  the\r\n\r\nsole supporter of her family.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The term \"family\" is defined as:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a wife and child (or children) in the case of a male officer; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a child or children in the case of a woman\r\n\r\nofficer  who  is a widow or divorcee or who  has  been\r\n\r\ngranted a decree of judicial separation and who is the\r\n\r\nsole supporter of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the above amounts to is that male officers\r\n\r\nenjoy   medical   benefits  which  are   automatically\r\n\r\nextended  to  his  wife and children,  whereas  female\r\n\r\nofficers  are  entitled  to  such  benefits  only  for\r\n\r\nherself.  Her  husband and children are  not  accorded\r\n\r\nmedical benefits, and they will have to pay. Only if a\r\n\r\nfemale  officer  is widowed or divorced  are  benefits\r\n\r\nextended to her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it unacceptable that this Government regards\r\n\r\nfemale officers as less equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  men, for in almost every way they are  equal  to\r\n\r\nmen, in their work performance and productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pattern of the family unit has changed over\r\n\r\nthe  years, and today the male may not necessarily  be\r\n\r\nthe head of the household. Again, large and increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  of females are employed in the civil service.\r\n\r\nIn   keeping  with  the  Government's  philosophy  and\r\n\r\npractice  of equal treatment for both sexes and  equal\r\n\r\nrewards. I hope the Hon.

Member for Anson and  make\r\n\r\nsome comments on the regulations governing the payment\r\n\r\nof  the  13th  month allowance to civil  servants  and\r\n\r\nemployees  in statutory boards. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson has gone to great lengths to describe\r\n\r\nthe  different  situations  in  which  employees  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  without  being  awarded  the  13th   month\r\n\r\nallowance.  He has also taken great pains to  describe\r\n\r\nthe  situations of families of employees who  died  in\r\n\r\nservice and who faced the heartless officials  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  who  came calling on  them  asking  for  a\r\n\r\nrefund of the 13th month allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations also do not favour those who retire\r\n\r\nfrom  service before 31st December. To take an extreme\r\n\r\ncase,  an  employee  whose  birthday  falls  on   30th\r\n\r\nDecember, will therefore reach his retirement  age  on\r\n\r\n30th  December. He automatically retires and  forfeits\r\n\r\nhis  13th month allowance. He loses it not through any\r\n\r\nfault of his own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  simply because he had the misfortune to  be  born\r\n\r\none day earlier. It also does not favour those who opt\r\n\r\nfor early retirement from service if they tender their\r\n\r\nresignation  before  31st December  even  though  they\r\n\r\ncontinue  serving up till 31st December. It  does  not\r\n\r\nseem  fair  that  a person should be denied  his  13th\r\n\r\nmonth  allowance just because he is simply abiding  by\r\n\r\nregulations governing notice of resignation even if he\r\n\r\nis still in service up till 31st December. The present\r\n\r\nregulations  obviously leave much to be  desired.  The\r\n\r\n13th month allowance is an incentive for those who are\r\n\r\nin  service  to continue being loyal to the Government\r\n\r\nbut  it is also an appreciation of service put  in  by\r\n\r\nemployees during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 13th month allowance is not a bonus such as that\r\n\r\ngranted  by  commercial  firms,  but  in  essence   it\r\n\r\noperates  like one. It contains two elements; firstly,\r\n\r\none  of  providing further incentives  and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nappreciating  past services. It is the latter  element\r\n\r\nthat  is  important for appreciation for past services\r\n\r\nin itself contains a built-in incentive to an employee\r\n\r\nto  strive harder in the coming year. But just because\r\n\r\none  chooses not to continue in service or has to  opt\r\n\r\nout of service or because fate has played a cruel hand\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that  his  past  services  cannot  be\r\n\r\nappreciated.  The  Government awards  the  13th  month\r\n\r\npayment to an employee who enters during the course of\r\n\r\nthe  year on a pro rata basis. Cannot this be  applied\r\n\r\nalso  to  those who leave the service in the year?  It\r\n\r\nseems  that the fairest solution, therefore, would  be\r\n\r\nto award the 13th month allowance on a pro rata basis.\r\n\r\nAs  an example, an employee who retires at the end  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  should be paid three-quarters of  the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth allowance for that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Government has made rules to suit\r\n\r\nits  own  pocket:  \"Pay when you have  to  pay;  avoid\r\n\r\npayment  when  you can.\" No doubt it is  a  very  wise\r\n\r\npolicy to adopt by any government. But cannot we  just\r\n\r\nshow some appreciation for those who leave? Cannot  we\r\n\r\nshow some compassion for those who die? The Government\r\n\r\nseems to take the stand that, \"Since you are no longer\r\n\r\ngoing to be with us,' we are conveniently going to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforget   what  you  have  done  in  the   past.\"   The\r\n\r\nregulations  were  first  made  when  the  13th  month\r\n\r\nallowance  was first introduced. Those who made  these\r\n\r\nregulations did not foresee the situations that  would\r\n\r\narise  as  a  result  of rigid interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\nrules.  But  now that many actual cases have  appeared\r\n\r\nthat  have  led  to many disputes, caused  anguish  to\r\n\r\nsome,  is it not time for us to make changes to  these\r\n\r\nrules?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  allocation for the  Main  estimates  is\r\n\r\nabout  $809  million, for Development  estimates  $659\r\n\r\nmillion,  of  which $105 million is for new  projects.\r\n\r\nJurong  Town Corporation gets $245 million and Housing\r\n\r\nScheme $8.5 million. At the same time $220 million  is\r\n\r\nfor  loans  to  industrial and commercial enterprises.\r\n\r\n$220 million for commerce and industry seems to me  to\r\n\r\nbe  too small. The other day the Minister for Law  and\r\n\r\nthe  Environment said in this House that  the  Raffles\r\n\r\nCentre Shopping Complex development plan would require\r\n\r\n$500  million  and  yet  the total  loan  to  all  our\r\n\r\ncommercial  and industrial enterprises  is  only  $220\r\n\r\nmillion. How can it be enough?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I would like to raise. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's   loans  are  mainly  for  industry   and\r\n\r\ncommerce to the neglect of farming. This is not right.\r\n\r\nSince  we  are emphasising on the development  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  in  all fields, in other words,  diversifying\r\n\r\nthe  economy,  we  should also look  after  the  other\r\n\r\nsectors and also provide loans to the farming industry\r\n\r\nincluding  pig  and chicken rearing,  orchid  growing,\r\n\r\ntropical fish breeding and so on. This will help  them\r\n\r\nto generate more income and also enable them to export\r\n\r\ntheir  produce  abroad to gain large sums  of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange.   Therefore  there   should   not   be   any\r\n\r\ndiscrimination by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to raise a few questions to the\r\n\r\nMinister. Firstly, the Minister for Finance  has  said\r\n\r\nin  his Budget Speech that our economic growth was  7%\r\n\r\nlast  year and that our economic weather is good,  our\r\n\r\nship  of state is in good shape and the command should\r\n\r\nbe \"steady as she goes\". This is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstout  slogan meaning that in the coming year we  will\r\n\r\nbe  having a higher economic growth. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  what  is the  expectation  or  the\r\n\r\npercentage growth for next year. He has said  that  it\r\n\r\nis about 6-8%. This seems to be going backwards. So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask him on what basis has he made  this\r\n\r\ncalculation  of  6-8% growth. Is it due  to  increased\r\n\r\nforeign investments here or greater expansion  of  our\r\n\r\ncommerce and industries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in his Budget it is stated that last year\r\n\r\nprivate  building  construction had decreased  by  3%.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  decrease for the third year. In  view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  I  would like to ask the Minister what measures\r\n\r\nhas  he  got to help the private building construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  If  this  sector  can  recover,   it   will\r\n\r\ncertainly be able to contribute much to our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Minister has also pointed out in his\r\n\r\nBudget  Speech  that securing foreign  investments  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  heavy task for the Government to  tackle.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask him what plans he has to  overcome\r\n\r\nany   such   difficulties,  how  to   induce   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  and what kind of incentives  or  tax  and\r\n\r\nother concessions is he going to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Minister has said that there is a\r\n\r\nshortfall of about $1,500 million in the Budget.  This\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be  financed  by  virement  from   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  and borrowing  or  the  raising  of\r\n\r\nbonds.  This is a very judicious plan because  in  the\r\n\r\npast  the previous two tax-free public bonds had  been\r\n\r\nfully subscribed. If the Minister could plan well  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  funds, I am sure it will be  welcome  and\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  The  recent $40 million bond  issue  will\r\n\r\ncertainly be successfully raised. In view of all these\r\n\r\nreasons  we  need  have  no  fear  of  getting  enough\r\n\r\ndevelopment  funds  for  various  projects.  I   would\r\n\r\ntherefore  like to ask the Minister whether  he  would\r\n\r\nassure  this  House that in the coming  two  or  three\r\n\r\nyears  he  will not levy any more taxes on  road  tax,\r\n\r\nproperty tax, hawker licences, PUB bills, radio and TV\r\n\r\nlicences,  commercial  or  other  taxes, licences  or\r\n\r\ncharges  so  as to enable our people to  help  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  in a more peaceful  and  undisturbed\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly last year, there was a trade deficit\r\n\r\namounting  to $6,000 million, a surprising  sum.  What\r\n\r\nremedy does he have to reduce our trade deficit?  When\r\n\r\nwinding  up his speech on the 14th of this month,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that he would consider  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nTrade  Development Council to further promote external\r\n\r\ntrade.  Very  good, I hope practical  action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken, not just consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand have\r\n\r\nsigned  a  10% tariff concession on mutual  goods  for\r\n\r\nexport  within  these three countries.  What  are  the\r\n\r\nreactions  of  other  ASEAN countries?  Has  Singapore\r\n\r\nconsulted other ASEAN countries on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there are quite a number  of  questions\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have to answer. The first one  is  from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson.  He spoke about  the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank and the Giro system, and asked whether it\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  used  for the  purpose  of  a  central\r\n\r\ncollection  system. The Management Services Department\r\n\r\nhas  been studying for some time the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\ncentral  collection  agency  with  collection   points\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  island  to  collect  fees  and  rates\r\n\r\npayable to Government and statutory boards. While  the\r\n\r\nconcept of multi-purpose centres for the collection of\r\n\r\nbills  has  been  found  to be  feasible,  the  actual\r\n\r\nphysical  setup  has not been determined  and  several\r\n\r\npossibilities  are being explored. One  of  these,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  the  use of the POSB which  has  branches\r\n\r\nthroughout the island. However, the POSB Giro  system,\r\n\r\ndespite the advantages that it has, does not appear to\r\n\r\nbe sufficiently popular. For example, only about 3% of\r\n\r\nPOSB  account  holders are paying their bills  through\r\n\r\nthe POSB Giro system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he asked about tourism and what SIA was doing\r\n\r\nto  encourage  tourists to fly by  SIA, and  how  our\r\n\r\nnational  line  was  progressing,  and  how   it   was\r\n\r\ncompeting  with other airlines. The tourist  industry,\r\n\r\nof course, has been very buoyant. We hope to register\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan increase of 15% to 20% per year in tourist arrivals\r\n\r\nthis year. We do not think too high a figure would  be\r\n\r\nvery desirable because there is already a danger of  a\r\n\r\ndrop  in  the  standard  of courtesy  in  our  hotels,\r\n\r\nrestaurants,     shopping    and     other     service\r\n\r\nestablishments. But SIA is continuing with its efforts\r\n\r\nto  promote  tourism.  It has now,  firstly,  a  well-balanced network of services serving 27 cities  in  22\r\n\r\nforeign countries. It is constantly striving to expand\r\n\r\nthis network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 pm,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SIA spends very considerable sums in\r\n\r\nadvertising and promotion. During the year ending 31st\r\n\r\nMarch it spent $18 million overseas,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, SIA has invited a considerable number of\r\n\r\ntravel  editors and travel agents to Singapore to  see\r\n\r\nfor themselves the attractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Singapore has developed a package of\r\n\r\nholiday  programmes which are targetted for  its  main\r\n\r\ntourist originating ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SIA has spearheaded the establishment of\r\n\r\nattractive  excursion  fares  in  its  main   tourist-generating areas overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum total of SIA's efforts is restricted in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of passengers it carries to Singapore. In  the\r\n\r\ncalendar  year 1976, SIA carried 541,000  passengers,\r\n\r\nexcluding returning residents and West Malaysians into\r\n\r\nSingapore, comprising 43% of total arrivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about SIA's progress and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  with  other  airlines.  Given   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities, SIA can hold its own with  the  world's\r\n\r\nairlines,  Unfortunately, it is not always allowed  to\r\n\r\nspread  its  wings. A case in point is the  series  of\r\n\r\ntraffic  rights discussions with the USA.  After  five\r\n\r\nrounds  of negotiations starting as far back  as  1974\r\n\r\nthere  has  been absolutely no progress. At  the  last\r\n\r\nround  of talks, the US delegation made a demand  that\r\n\r\nSIA  should  obtain rights for a US carrier  from  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  and  Filippino governments.  This  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, absolutely absurd and raises serious doubts as\r\n\r\nto whether the US delegation was sincere in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  efforts to reach agreement. A US airline has been\r\n\r\noperating flights to Singapore for the last  40  years\r\n\r\nbut  SIA  is  still denied the opportunity to  operate\r\n\r\neven one cargo service a week to the West Coast of the\r\n\r\nUSA.  However.  I  suppose  we  must  be  patient  and\r\n\r\npersistent,  and  we believe that the American  people\r\n\r\nwho  are fair minded will allow SIA eventually to show\r\n\r\nits paces across the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked about our trade with\r\n\r\nWestern countries. Trade with the US. Canada, the  EEC\r\n\r\nand  the remaining countries in EFTA has expanded from\r\n\r\n$4.2  billion  in 1971 to $11.4 billion  in  1976,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 160%. During this period, our exports grew\r\n\r\nmore  than 3 1/2 times from $1.5 billion in 1971 to  $5.5\r\n\r\nbillion in 1976. Our domestic exports to these markets\r\n\r\nhave fared even better as they have increased by about\r\n\r\n5 1/2  times  from $610 million to $3.4 billion over  the\r\n\r\nperiod  1971  to 1976. Our export performance  is  due\r\n\r\npartly  to  the preferential access to the markets  of\r\n\r\nthe  US  and the EEC we enjoy under their GSP schemes.\r\n\r\nIt  is also the result of a joint effort by Government\r\n\r\nand  the  private  sector to increase  the  range  and\r\n\r\nsophistication of our products. However, we  have  our\r\n\r\nshare  of  trade problems with the Western  countries.\r\n\r\nWith  high levels of unemployment. Western governments\r\n\r\nare   subjected  to  domestic  pressures  for  greater\r\n\r\nprotectionism.  About  40% of  our  total  exports  of\r\n\r\ntextiles  and  garments are subject to  import  quotas\r\n\r\nimposed by the Western countries. Our more competitive\r\n\r\nelectronic  exports have also triggered protests  from\r\n\r\nsome countries as we attempt to upgrade and diversify.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  while we have performed satisfactorily  in\r\n\r\nthese markets, we will remain alert and intensify  our\r\n\r\nexport promotion efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the main query that I have to answer\r\n\r\nhere  is  the  payment of the 13th month allowance.  I\r\n\r\nhave  already answered quite a number of supplementary\r\n\r\nquestions during Question Time. But I notice  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  not satisfied Members. However. I do not think  I\r\n\r\ncan  do better than to repeat again. The nature of the\r\n\r\nnon-pensionable  allowance  is  a  13th  month  salary\r\n\r\nsupplement payable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople who are in service on the 31st December. It  is\r\n\r\nno use suggesting that this annual allowance should be\r\n\r\nof a different nature and that it should be a token of\r\n\r\nappreciation  to officers who have already  done  some\r\n\r\nservice  but  are not in service on 31st December.  It\r\n\r\nwas  not  so conceived and there is no way in which  I\r\n\r\ncan  change the nature of this allowance to make it  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of compassionate allowance. The difference  is\r\n\r\nlike the difference between a cat and a dog. It is  no\r\n\r\nuse suggesting that the cat should be a dog and should\r\n\r\nbe friendly and compassionate. The fact is that it was\r\n\r\nborn  a  cat, and the non-pensionable annual allowance\r\n\r\nlikewise,  by its very nature, is a payment made  only\r\n\r\nto   serving  officers  on  31st  December   and   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily to officers who have done good service and\r\n\r\nshould   perhaps   be   considered   for   a   certain\r\n\r\nconsideration by Government, whether in the form of an\r\n\r\nappreciation or by way of ex gratia payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry would have no objection to any statutory\r\n\r\nbody  exercising a discretion in special circumstances\r\n\r\nof  extreme hardship to waive recovery. Let us not mix\r\n\r\nthe two matters. One is a matter of ex gratia payment,\r\n\r\nand  the  other is a matter of entitlement to  a  non-pensionable annual allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was one other question I have to\r\n\r\nanswer on the Civil Service. The Member for Anson  has\r\n\r\nsome doubts whether there is fairness and impartiality\r\n\r\nin  the selection of persons who are promoted. I think\r\n\r\nwe  ensure  such fairness and impartiality by  getting\r\n\r\nofficers  who  are  carefully  selected  to  serve  on\r\n\r\npromotion panels. Promoting authorities are concerned,\r\n\r\nI think, only with the attributes of candidates. These\r\n\r\nattributes  can  be  grouped  under  three  factors  - qualification, merit and experience. In the nature  of\r\n\r\nthings, however, in every promotion exercise there  is\r\n\r\nbound  to  be a number of unsuccessful candidates  who\r\n\r\nbecome  dissatisfied with the conduct, and outcome  of\r\n\r\nthe exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Kim Seng who asked\r\n\r\nwhether husbands of married civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants could be eligible for consideration under the\r\n\r\nmedical benefit scheme of the Government. While I  can\r\n\r\nappreciate the arguments which he has provided, we are\r\n\r\nstill living in an age where in any divorce case,  the\r\n\r\nwoman  is  never asked to pay alimony to the  husband,\r\n\r\nand  I  think it is generally considered that husbands\r\n\r\nare  capable of taking care of themselves. In the same\r\n\r\nway, the regulation has been framed on that assumption\r\n\r\nbut  in the unlikely event that a woman officer has  a\r\n\r\nhusband  who is completely dependent upon  her.  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to consider the case for medical benefit as a\r\n\r\nspecial one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised a number of\r\n\r\nquestions. One was on the real growth likely for 1977.\r\n\r\nI  have gone into this in some detail and there  is  a\r\n\r\ngood chance of our achieving a real growth of 6 to  8%\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether there was any likely difficulty due\r\n\r\nto  the  lack  of investments, and what further  steps\r\n\r\nwere  being taken to attract such investments. We have\r\n\r\ntried  to ensure that domestically the conditions  are\r\n\r\nconducive to attracting new investments. We  offer  an\r\n\r\nattractive tax package and have always given  priority\r\n\r\nto   providing  adequate  industrial  facilities   and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts have also been made to upgrade skills in our\r\n\r\nlabour  force to meet the requirements of industry.  A\r\n\r\nsound  and orderly system of wage increases linked  to\r\n\r\nproductivity has also helped us to remain  competitive\r\n\r\nand,  externally,  key personnel  have  been  deployed\r\n\r\noverseas to step up the promotion efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also give more assistance from the Capital\r\n\r\nAssistance  and  Small Industries Finance  Schemes.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  up  to  date the amounts given  have  been\r\n\r\ndismal, but that is because we have started with these\r\n\r\ntwo schemes only over the last year or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked for an assurance that no levy\r\n\r\nof taxes be raised for the rest of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  year.  I have already answered that  question  - that   a   Minister  for  Finance  never  gives   such\r\n\r\nassurances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the trade figures and spoke of\r\n\r\nour  trade  deficit of $6 billion. With  a  developing\r\n\r\neconomy  and  with no natural resources like  ours,  a\r\n\r\ntrade  deficit is inevitable. We require large imports\r\n\r\nof  capital  goods  and  equipment  to  build  up  our\r\n\r\nproductive  capacity and we are dependent on  external\r\n\r\nsources  for  the  bulk of our  food  supply  and  raw\r\n\r\nmaterial  inputs  for  our  industry.  We  expect   to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with this trade deficit as we go  into  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  servicing industries.  Industries  like\r\n\r\nshiprepairing  which require heavy  capital  equipment\r\n\r\nadd  to  our trade import bill, but the services  they\r\n\r\nrender  are  not  shown in the trade  account  as  the\r\n\r\nproduct of these industries is registered only in  the\r\n\r\nservices account and not in the export account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, as an objective of our trade\r\n\r\npolicy,  the reduction of the trade deficit. Over  the\r\n\r\nyears  we have diversified into new products  and  new\r\n\r\nmarkets. We have, for example, gone into production of\r\n\r\ntelevision  tubes  and  chassis  and  quartz  crystals\r\n\r\nrequiring  high levels of technology. Our  exports  to\r\n\r\nWest  Asia  have also developed by 12 times  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  six  years. Our Trade Investment and  Diplomatic\r\n\r\nOffices  will be strengthened in key centres. We  will\r\n\r\nalso set up permanent exhibition centres in West Asia.\r\n\r\nAs  Members  are  aware, we are  not  considering  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Trade Development Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about the Philippines and\r\n\r\nThailand  and  across-the-board reduction  of  10%  of\r\n\r\nexisting  tariffs. Our bilateral agreement with  these\r\n\r\ntwo  countries is a concrete step forward in cementing\r\n\r\ncloser economic ties and we have briefed Indonesia and\r\n\r\nMalaysia on these arrangements. Consideration is being\r\n\r\ngiven  now  to the implementation of bilateral  tariff\r\n\r\nreductions under the ASEAN Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Through   such\r\n\r\nassignments  it  is hoped that our top civil  servants\r\n\r\nwill be able to provide a more courteous and effective\r\n\r\nservice  to  the public. From time to time  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants are subjected to criticisms on the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich   they   interpret   and  discharge   Government\r\n\r\npolicies.  I must say that such courses are  necessary\r\n\r\nif the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment is to implement its policies successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is whether there is any\r\n\r\nfollow-up  action on the part of the CSSDI or  whether\r\n\r\nany  assessment is made on the participants to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  such  useful  experiences  gained  are  put   to\r\n\r\neffective  use.  Do  these civil servants  impart  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  gained  to their subordinates?  As  we  are\r\n\r\naware,  not all Division I civil servants have  direct\r\n\r\nor personal contacts with members of the public in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  their duties. In many cases such  contacts\r\n\r\nare  normally delegated to their subordinates. In view\r\n\r\nof  this,  would it not be desirable for the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  to  provide  such  experience  to  civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  other  divisions who are  constantly  in\r\n\r\ncontact  with members of the public in the  course  of\r\n\r\ntheir  duties?

I shall,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnot  touch on this aspect, but instead on how we could\r\n\r\nalleviate  the effect of high costs of energy  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of economic development. Before I  do  that,\r\n\r\nSir,  let me briefly explain why I am taking  up  this\r\n\r\nsubject   under   the   subhead   \"Permanent   Staff\".\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Division, under  Head  X,  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some months ago, it was reported in the newspapers\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of National Development was studying\r\n\r\nthe  design and construction of buildings with a  view\r\n\r\nto  cutting down unnecessary heat absorption from  the\r\n\r\nsun  so  that  expenditure  on  air-conditioning,  for\r\n\r\nexample, could be reduced. The Public Utilities  Board\r\n\r\nhas also revised its electricity consumption tariff to\r\n\r\npenalise the high consumers so as to cut down the  use\r\n\r\nof  energy.  More recently, some hon. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse have suggested that the Ministry of Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology undertake research into the capture and use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  solar  energy, as we have plenty of it. All  these\r\n\r\nactions  and  suggestions are sound, but the  point  I\r\n\r\nwish   to   make  is  that  there  is  no   nationally\r\n\r\ncoordinated  effort  to work out a  long-range  energy\r\n\r\nstrategy  or programme to mitigate the effect  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh price of oil. I think the Development Division of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance is the best place to work out\r\n\r\nsuch  a  national programme, it being responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  economic development of the country. I would like\r\n\r\nto  know  from  the Hon. Minister for Finance  whether\r\n\r\nsuch  a programme has been or is being worked out;  if\r\n\r\nnot,  whether  he  would consider  initiating  such  a\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main aspects to a long range energy\r\n\r\nprogramme for a country: (1) developing new sources or\r\n\r\nalternative  forms of energy, and (2)  conserving  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  energy. Given a small economy and  a  smaller\r\n\r\ngeographical  area,  the  first  aspect  is  of   less\r\n\r\nrelevance  to us. We have no oil, shale  oil  or  coal\r\n\r\nreserves.  True,  we have plenty of  sunlight,  but  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether  we  have the energy and  resources  to\r\n\r\nundertake  primary research into this area  of  energy\r\n\r\nresource.  Take  the case of Japan, for  example.  The\r\n\r\nfinancial   commitment  of   a   MITI   (Ministry   of\r\n\r\nInternational Trade and Industry) sponsored  \"Sunshine\r\n\r\nProject\" inaugurated in July 1974 envisaged a  minimum\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in constant prices of Yen  4,260  billion\r\n\r\n(or  about  S$37 billion) on research and  development\r\n\r\nwork  for the period 1974 to the year 2000. (The  main\r\n\r\nareas  of  research under the \"Sunshine  Project\"  are\r\n\r\nsolar energy, geothermal energy, coal gasification and\r\n\r\nliquefaction, and hydrogen.) I doubt if we can  afford\r\n\r\nthat kind of expenditure on research into new forms of\r\n\r\nenergy.  Nor  is  it  necessary.  Rather,  we   should\r\n\r\nconcentrate on secondary research to keep  abreast  of\r\n\r\ncurrent scientific and commercial development  in  the\r\n\r\nuse of new sources or alternative forms of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of a long range energy strategy,\r\n\r\nthat   of  energy  conservation,  is  what  we  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on. We could call it a Long Range  Energy\r\n\r\nConservation  Programme. It  is  long  range  because,\r\n\r\nfirstly, any conservation programme has a long lead\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime,  and  secondly, it must be followed  through  so\r\n\r\nthat it becomes a way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Range Energy Conservation Programme could\r\n\r\nhave the following objectives:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To bring about a change in political and\r\n\r\nelectoral  attitudes regarding the value  and  use  of\r\n\r\nenergy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To work with industry to increase the efficiency\r\n\r\nin  the  use of energy, i.e, reduce energy  input  per\r\n\r\nunit of output; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To exact greater effort to reduce retained oil\r\n\r\nimports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservation Programme could include the\r\n\r\nfollowing elements:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Differential pricing to discourage the excessive\r\n\r\nuse of energy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Selective mandatory energy-saving measures such\r\n\r\nas  the maximum amount of lighting for advertisements,\r\n\r\nor  minimum  insulation standards for  air-conditioned\r\n\r\nbuildings;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Building codes aimed at energy conservation;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Financial incentives for investment by industries\r\n\r\nin energy-saving equipment; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Financial or fiscal incentives to promote the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  skilled, labour-intensive  industries\r\n\r\nrequiring relatively smaller energy input per unit  of\r\n\r\noutput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an expert on energy conservation and\r\n\r\nhence  could only touch sketchily on some points which\r\n\r\nI  think  require further attention by specialists.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Development Division will formulate  such  a\r\n\r\nnational programme for energy conservation. I am  sure\r\n\r\nthey have the energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, the recent\r\n\r\nGovernment's  scheme of financial  assistance  to  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding industry to enable Singapore shipbuilders\r\n\r\nto compete in the international market is very commend\r\n\r\nable. But I understand that the scheme has been fouled\r\n\r\nup by too much bureaucratic red-tape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the scheme is a matter of great\r\n\r\nconcern  to me. Not that I seek to be a spokesman  for\r\n\r\nthe shipbuilding managements, but I view the scheme as\r\n\r\nan  aid  for  maintaining job opportunities.  The  two\r\n\r\nunions I am associated with, SILO and PIEU, have a few\r\n\r\nthousand members who are employees of the shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry. Their livelihood is being threatened through\r\n\r\nthe  inability of our shipbuilding industry to compete\r\n\r\non  equal  terms  with their foreign competitors.  The\r\n\r\nprimary cause of such inability is the difficulty,  or\r\n\r\nthe red-tape, local shipbuilders have to go through to\r\n\r\nsecure credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the normal practice for a local firm, which\r\n\r\nhas  successfully bid a contract to build a  ship,  to\r\n\r\nallow  the buyer to pay only 30% of the total cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  ship  as  a  down-payment. The  local  firm  then\r\n\r\napplies to the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) for\r\n\r\na  loan  equivalent to 70% of the total cost to enable\r\n\r\nthe firm to build the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when the troubles arise. The DBS requires\r\n\r\nthe  prospective  buyer  to furnish  in  duplicate  or\r\n\r\ntriplicate his personal particulars, some of which the\r\n\r\nbuyer  considers  impertinent  or  irrelevant  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  his credit-worthiness. Fair enough,  the\r\n\r\nbuyer must answer personal questions to determine  his\r\n\r\nfinancial   status.  But  the  fact  is   that   other\r\n\r\ncountries,  who are our competitors are  more  lenient\r\n\r\ntowards  their  buyers and have done  away  with  such\r\n\r\nquestions. It is, therefore, not surprising that  some\r\n\r\nbuyers react hostilely and refuse to answer all  these\r\n\r\nimpertinent  questions, since they can have  the  ship\r\n\r\nbuilt elsewhere on not less favourable terms of credit\r\n\r\nand  without  the need to answer all these impertinent\r\n\r\nquestions.  I  was told that some local firms  had  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  contracts to build ships  because  of  these\r\n\r\nimpertinent questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the red-tape problem is that\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  basis on which the credit  facilities\r\n\r\nare  made available only for the contruction of self-propelled   ocean-going  ships  of  more  than   5,000\r\n\r\ndeadweight tonnes. Our members are not only employed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin building ocean-going ships but also in building oil\r\n\r\nrigs  and dredgers. The fact that Singapore is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  biggest oil rig builders seems to be a matter  of\r\n\r\nno  consequence to the Finance Ministry  or  the  DBS.\r\n\r\nApparently,  no  credit facilities  can  be  given  to\r\n\r\nbuilders  of  oil rigs and dredgers. A Director  of  a\r\n\r\ncompany  told  our union leaders that he  lost  a  $36\r\n\r\nmillion  contract  because the  DBS  refused  to  give\r\n\r\ncredit  facilities for the building  of  dredgers.  In\r\n\r\nthis  instance, the firm had secured 100% credit  from\r\n\r\nEXIM Bank of Japan for the machinery. What the builder\r\n\r\nneeded was credit for labour cost and materials  which\r\n\r\nwould have been in the region of $3 or $4 million. DBS\r\n\r\nrejected the application because the dredgers  had  no\r\n\r\npropellers. And, consequently, more than 200 employees\r\n\r\nlost  their  jobs. These 200-odd employees  would  not\r\n\r\nhave joined the rank of the unemployed if the DBS  had\r\n\r\nnot been so rigid in its adherence to its self-imposed\r\n\r\nrules for the granting of credit facilities. Moreover.\r\n\r\nsuch rules do not seem to have taken into account  the\r\n\r\ncharacter of Singapore's shipbuilding industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the red-tape problem is that\r\n\r\nconcerning   the   guarantee  the   DBS   wants   from\r\n\r\nshipbuilders. The guarantee is to the effect that  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilder  guarantees repayment of the  loan  during\r\n\r\nthe  seven-year period. Shipbuilders accept the orders\r\n\r\nplaced with them in good faith. Buyers are required to\r\n\r\nmake a downpayment equivalent to 30% of the total cost\r\n\r\nof  their orders. But it will take one or two years to\r\n\r\nfulfil   their  orders.  In  the  meantime,   due   to\r\n\r\nunforeseen   circumstances  or  international   events\r\n\r\nbeyond   their  control,  buyers  may  be  unable   or\r\n\r\nunwilling  to take delivery or, after taking delivery,\r\n\r\nthe  buyers may go bankrupt before repaying the  loan.\r\n\r\nShipbuilders,  therefore, cannot  guarantee  that  the\r\n\r\nbuyers  will  take  delivery of the  ships  they  have\r\n\r\nordered   or   repay   the   loan   fully.   In   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the  local shipbuilder  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nsecure sufficient shipbuilding orders, not because  he\r\n\r\ncannot  win  such  orders  in  open  competition, but\r\n\r\nbecause   he   cannot  obtain  the  necessary   credit\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect the Minister for Finance's retort to be\r\n\r\nthe  usual platitude - that the red-tape is necessary\r\n\r\nif  financial institutions are to be viable. But what\r\n\r\nI  am unhappy about is, not that the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nor the DBS do not throw caution to the winds and lend\r\n\r\nindiscriminately,  but  that  they   are   not   more\r\n\r\nimaginative and realistic in giving credit facilities\r\n\r\nto  shipbuilders. Japanese shipbuilders' success  can\r\n\r\nin  a  way  be  attributed to the  credit  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided by EXIM Bank of Japan. Probably the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  can  have another look at  the  Japanese\r\n\r\nmethod when it lays down policies for DBS to adhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy is that Singapore can ill-afford to\r\n\r\nlose    all   shipbuilding   orders,   which    local\r\n\r\nshipbuilders are prevented from accepting because  of\r\n\r\nthe red-tape governing credit facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat   steps   are  being  taken  by   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to ensure the smooth and  effective\r\n\r\ntransfer of technology to our Singapore workers?  Our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme is more than 10 years old\r\n\r\nand  to-date  the technology transfer  is  still  far\r\n\r\nbelow that expected.

I agree with the\r\n\r\nMember for Marine Parade that, as far as research  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the size of our economy is such  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  spend  large  sums  of  money  on\r\n\r\nresearch programmes which are already being  done  by\r\n\r\ncountries  like Japan, the United States  of  America\r\n\r\nand  other  developed countries.  In  any  case,  the\r\n\r\nresearch in nuclear power and in solar power must  be\r\n\r\non   a  long-term  basis.  As  far  as  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is likely that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall  have  to  rely  upon conventional  sources  of\r\n\r\nenergy supplies, such as oil and coal. Whilst  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that we can buy nuclear power. I think  the\r\n\r\nsize  of our country is such that there is really  no\r\n\r\nplace  where  we  could safely put  a  nuclear  power\r\n\r\nstation  and, unless  we have  absolutely  no  other\r\n\r\nalternative,   we   will  have   to   give   up   the\r\n\r\nconsideration of nuclear power station as a  solution\r\n\r\nto our energy problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as conservation is concerned. I think we can\r\n\r\ndo  something.  In  fact, when the sudden  and  steep\r\n\r\nincrease in crude oil prices began in October 1973 we\r\n\r\nhad  a  national  \"Save energy\"  campaign.  This  was\r\n\r\nconducted on a voluntary basis without any element of\r\n\r\ncompulsion.  A committee chaired by the  Director  of\r\n\r\nTrade   was   set   up.  The  result  was   initially\r\n\r\nencouraging.   The   rate  of  increase   of   energy\r\n\r\nconsumption fell to 4% the following year, that  is,\r\n\r\n1974, and  7%  in  1975. As  a  result  of  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery last year, the rate of increase rose to  10%\r\n\r\nbut still well below the average rate of increase  of\r\n\r\n20% in energy consumption in the years before the oil\r\n\r\ncrisis. In December 1973 we had, what is called,  the\r\n\r\nRestrictions on the Supply, Distribution and  Use  of\r\n\r\nPetroleum  and  Electricity Act,  which  was  passed,\r\n\r\nempowering  the Government to restrict energy  usage.\r\n\r\nThis  Act  is  still  in force. Since  then  we  have\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  encourage the conservation  of  energy\r\n\r\nthrough various campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Marine Parade has suggested,\r\n\r\namendments  to  existing regulations  to  incorporate\r\n\r\nenergy  conservation requirements in building  design\r\n\r\nwould  also help to cut down energy wastage  so  that\r\n\r\nnow  a sufficiently close and effective vigilance  on\r\n\r\nenergy usage can be coordinated and sustained through\r\n\r\nthe  work  of the Department of Trade and the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board. But the problem is admittedly a very\r\n\r\ncomplex one requiring a sense of economy on the  part\r\n\r\nof  all  energy  users, whether  they  be  Government\r\n\r\nministries, industries, businesses, motorists   or\r\n\r\nindividual   households.  I   think   our   immediate\r\n\r\nrequirements  are ensured, however, by the  Agreement\r\n\r\nwhich we signed recently for preferential trading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangements  in  ASEAN  which,  under  one   of   its\r\n\r\nprovisions,  gives us preference to  the  supplies  of\r\n\r\nenergy from our neighbours. Because of this particular\r\n\r\nagreement, I think there should be less worry  on  our\r\n\r\npart on the supplies necessary for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Boon Teck. He has\r\n\r\nraised  the  question of Government's scheme  for  the\r\n\r\ncredit facilities to the shipbuilding industry. He has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  I  would answer him  with  the  usual\r\n\r\nplatitudes. I hope I do not, although I could say that\r\n\r\neven  if  I  did so in the terms in which he suggested\r\n\r\nthat  I  would  do. I would only be suggesting  normal\r\n\r\nbanking prudence. The Member has himself in his speech\r\n\r\nspoken  of the difficulties shipbuilders face,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Due to unforeseen circumstances or international\r\n\r\nevents  beyond their control, buyers may be unable  or\r\n\r\nunwilling  to take delivery or, after taking delivery,\r\n\r\nthe buyers may go bankrupt before repaying the loan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   DBS   and  other  banks  also  face   the   same\r\n\r\ndifficulties when they have to return the money  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government may have advanced them  so  that  some\r\n\r\ncaution from them is surely reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing ship financing scheme of the banks, and\r\n\r\nof  the Development Bank of Singapore particularly, is\r\n\r\nmodelled on the Japanese EXIM bank credit scheme which\r\n\r\nin  turn is based on guidelines laid down by the OECD.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was started in 1971 for vessels above 5,000\r\n\r\ndeadweight tonnes and subsequently extended  to  cover\r\n\r\nalso   vessels  of  below  5,000  deadweight   tonnes.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  is not Government's policy to  subsidise\r\n\r\nthe   local   shipbuilding  industry.  Government   is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  assist the industry wherever appropriate\r\n\r\nto  enable  them  to  compete effectively  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries. At the same time, I ought to say here  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have the same resources that Japan or  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  Western  countries have for  assistance  to\r\n\r\ntheir shipbuilding industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the alleged bureaucratic red-tape, perhaps the\r\n\r\nfollowing clarification should be made. The disclosure\r\n\r\nof  personal  particulars of potential  buyers  is  an\r\n\r\naccepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternational practice. Such information  is  required\r\n\r\nto assess the debt servicing activity of the borrower.\r\n\r\nI  would  be  very happy to learn from the Member  for\r\n\r\nBoon   Teck  what  particular  countries  give  credit\r\n\r\nwithout  even  inquiring into the particulars  of  the\r\n\r\nborrower.  As  in the OECD schemes, credit  facilities\r\n\r\nunder  the  Singapore scheme are not extended  to  oil\r\n\r\nrigs,  as the amount involved is fairly large and  the\r\n\r\ncredit  risks  are  different from ship  financing.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  financing  of oil rigs  is  a  matter  for\r\n\r\nsyndication by our merchant banks and other  banks  in\r\n\r\nour  financial  centre activities. Dredgers  are  also\r\n\r\nexcluded  as  they are not ships but  are  specialised\r\n\r\nforms   of  marine  and  earth  excavating  equipment.\r\n\r\nHowever. I think such financing can be considered on a\r\n\r\ncase  by case basis provided borrowers can comply with\r\n\r\nappropriate terms of financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the case of the dredger referred to by the\r\n\r\nMember  was actually considered on the merits  of  the\r\n\r\nproposal, but   the  financing   fell   through   as\r\n\r\ninsufficient  information was disclosed and  the  Bank\r\n\r\nwhich   was  to  provide  the  guarantee  had  already\r\n\r\nexceeded its credit lines from the DBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Japanese EXIM Bank credit scheme, credit\r\n\r\nfacilities are generally extended to builders  instead\r\n\r\nof  to buyers directly. In our case, direct lending to\r\n\r\nbuyers  are  considered on a case by case  basis.  The\r\n\r\ninterest rates of 8% to 8.5% per annum under  the  DBS\r\n\r\nscheme  are more attractive compared to other existing\r\n\r\nbank   going  rates  of  8.75%  to  9%  per   annum.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Japanese scheme is only available for\r\n\r\nvessels above 10,000 deadweight tonnes. Our scheme is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  in  fact  more  liberal  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  one  in quite a few areas. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay,  however,  that  the  Member's  concern  for  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding industry is shared by the Government  and\r\n\r\nthat  we will do what we can to alleviate any distress\r\n\r\nwhich  the  shipbuilding industry  is  facing  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question I have to consider is that raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Potong Pasir as to what  is  being\r\n\r\ndone  in  regard  to  the transfer  of  technology  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  fact, I believe that the  transfer  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  has been taking place all this while,  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole  period of industrialisation, and  that  we\r\n\r\nhave had some success from such transfers through  the\r\n\r\nactivities not only of our own industrialists but also\r\n\r\nthose  of the many foreign industrial firms we attract\r\n\r\nhere. The advantage of the multi-national companies is\r\n\r\nthat,   we   hope,  they  bring  their  most  advanced\r\n\r\ntechnology  from the West and that in the  process  of\r\n\r\nestablishing themselves here, the technology rubs  off\r\n\r\non  our local population. I do not know exactly how we\r\n\r\ncan  speed  up this transfer, There are  a  number  of\r\n\r\nother  methods we are able to pursue. One of these  is\r\n\r\nthat  we should perhaps acquire some of the industries\r\n\r\nin the US and other advanced technological centres and\r\n\r\ntry  and transfer them to firms in Singapore. I  think\r\n\r\nsome  of our local industries are already doing  this,\r\n\r\nand I hope that in the coming years there will be more\r\n\r\nand  more  of them doing the same, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nproducts which require not too much capital but a  lot\r\n\r\nof  entrepreneurial, scientific and technical  ability\r\n\r\nfrom   the  entrepreneurial  personnel  such   as   in\r\n\r\nelectronics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one point\r\n\r\nof  clarification  from the Minister  for  Finance.  I\r\n\r\nagree  with the Minister that a prudent banker  should\r\n\r\nensure that a loan must not be granted without careful\r\n\r\nconsideration and investigation. But I have been  told\r\n\r\nthat questions on the buyer's personal history and the\r\n\r\nnumber of wives he has have to be answered. What  have\r\n\r\nthese questions got to do with a person buying a ship?\r\n\r\nWhat  I am trying to point out here is this. Financing\r\n\r\nfor  the  building  of an oil rig or  a  ship  is  not\r\n\r\nsuccessful because the DBS rejects the application  as\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  impertinent  questions  have  not  been\r\n\r\nanswered. I was told that the EXIM Bank of Japan  have\r\n\r\ndropped these impertinent questions. Would it  not  be\r\n\r\neasier  to  grant  a loan or credit  facility  to  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilder in Singapore instead of to the  buyer,  so\r\n\r\nthat a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\ncontract to build the ship could be entered into?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> Sir, I am really surprised that\r\n\r\nthere should be any questions raised on the number  of\r\n\r\nwives   or   female  alliances  that  any  prospective\r\n\r\nborrower  has.  I  do not think that  is  particularly\r\n\r\ntrue.  I think the banks are only interested in  those\r\n\r\nparticulars  which relate to his financial operations.\r\n\r\nIt may be that if he has a very, very extravagant wife\r\n\r\nor   wives,  this  may  have  some  bearing  upon  his\r\n\r\nfinancial  standing.

And, in fact, we\r\n\r\nshould  still keep that company in existence for  such\r\n\r\ntraining  purposes  and exchange of  information  with\r\n\r\nother  companies in the same technological field,  and\r\n\r\nthen  bring back the engineers and maybe some  of  the\r\n\r\ntrainees to start similar operations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I would just like to take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to refer to the statement made by the\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier  on.  The Minister  mentioned  about\r\n\r\nsyndication  in financing of large-scale shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nI  am just wondering to what extent the Government  is\r\n\r\nencouraging this particular approach of financing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the size of the operations in\r\n\r\nfinancing  oil rigs, for example, would be of  such  a\r\n\r\ndegree that the Government itself would not be able to\r\n\r\nassist  very much. If we have to provide the resources\r\n\r\nfrom  which the banking sector, such as the DBS, were\r\n\r\nto  lend  to  oil rig builders and so on, the  amounts\r\n\r\nwould  be  so  considerable that the Government  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  find greater sources of finance.  And  I  am\r\n\r\nalready  having difficulty in this House in trying  to\r\n\r\nconvince  Members that there is a need for  broadening\r\n\r\nthe base of taxation or in increasing the taxes. So  I\r\n\r\nthink  on  this  point, perhaps the  financial  centre\r\n\r\nshould  try and do what it can to finance these rather\r\n\r\nspecialised  operations. I believe there are  merchant\r\n\r\nbanks  that  specialise in ship and oil rig  financing\r\n\r\nand  I  think we must leave this mostly to  them.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, of course, is very happy to  provide  the\r\n\r\nbasis  for  the financial centre operations.  We  will\r\n\r\ngive  as  many  licences as are  required  for  anyone\r\n\r\nwishing to enter into this business. But that  is  all\r\n\r\nthat we can do. Maybe through the DBS we can take some\r\n\r\npart in the syndication, but even in that, there is  a\r\n\r\nlimit to what we can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, can I just add a bit more?\r\n\r\nTaxation  is  totally irrelevant to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nsyndication for the financing of shipbuilding.

This means, among  other\r\n\r\nthings, that all the common services within the estate\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  paid  for  directly  by  the  owners  or\r\n\r\nresidents  of the estate. The residents pay a  monthly\r\n\r\nservice  charge  to  cover  common  services  such  as\r\n\r\nprovision and maintenance of lifts, common staircases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorridors, swimming pools, tennis or  squash  courts,\r\n\r\netc., all of which should properly be paid for by  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  But the residents also have  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  providing other services such as maintenance\r\n\r\nof  roads  and  drains, provision of street  lighting.\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  grass verges and  open  areas.  These\r\n\r\nlatter  services  are provided by  the  Government  or\r\n\r\nrelated  bodies  in every other part of  Singapore  at\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  expense  except in the  condominiums.  The\r\n\r\nresidents  in the condominiums, in addition to  paying\r\n\r\ntheir taxes like everyone else, have also to foot  the\r\n\r\nbills  for these services. The cost of these  services\r\n\r\ncan amount to as much as $100 per month per household.\r\n\r\nWould the Minister for Finance consider allowing these\r\n\r\nexpenses to be tax deductible, similar to that allowed\r\n\r\nfor expenses incurred for the maintenance of gardens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, at the moment I cannot see any\r\n\r\ngood reason why the expenses incurred in the upkeep of\r\n\r\nprivate  roads  and  other  amenities  meant  for  the\r\n\r\nexclusive  use  of  residents of  condominium  estates\r\n\r\nshould  be  deductible. Even residents of Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  estates have  to  pay  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges for upkeep and maintenance of the estates, and\r\n\r\nthe   conservancy  charges  they  pay  are   not   tax\r\n\r\ndeductible.

In a condominium,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a right of passage for  the  public.\r\n\r\nNevertheless if the Member can make out a better case,\r\n\r\nwe  will be prepared to give consideration as we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  consideration to all the suggestions of Members\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, the roads in some of the\r\n\r\ncondominiums are really no different from the roads in\r\n\r\nsome  estates  like  Serangoon Garden  Estate.  Watten\r\n\r\nEstate  or Hill Crest Estate. The conservancy  charges\r\n\r\npaid by the HDB cover the types of services which,  as\r\n\r\nI said, should be properly paid for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  residents.

However, permission\r\n\r\nwas  withdrawn by the Comptroller of Income Tax on 4th\r\n\r\nJune. 1975, without giving any apparent reasons. As an\r\n\r\napproved  fund  under the CPF, contributors  need  not\r\n\r\nmake  any  contribution to the CPF  owing  to  certain\r\n\r\nrules,  the concurrence of the Comptroller  of  Income\r\n\r\nTax  must  be obtained before any part of  the  credit\r\n\r\nbalance can be transferred over to the CPF. May I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether he will consider reviewing  this\r\n\r\nmatter again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this\r\n\r\namendment  I  would like to raise three questions.  On\r\n\r\npersonal  income  tax  relief  the  request  has  been\r\n\r\nrejected. There is no hope for more relief. So I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  some  other  reliefs. First, can the  relief  for\r\n\r\nmaintaining parents and grandparents be increased?  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment it is $750 per year. It is really a  small\r\n\r\namount  of money averaging $62.50 per month. Now  that\r\n\r\nprices are rising with inflation, $62.50 is not enough\r\n\r\neven for rental, much less to maintain an aged parent.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  ask the Minister to  increase  the\r\n\r\nrelief for aged parents from $750 to $1,500 per parent\r\n\r\nper year. On average, it will amount to $125 per month\r\n\r\ninstead  of $62.50, so that one can better look  after\r\n\r\none's  aged parents. This will be in keeping with  the\r\n\r\nvirtue of filial piety of the Eastern people and  also\r\n\r\nin keeping with the principles of care for the aged as\r\n\r\nmentioned in the Presidential Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on relief for income tax on\r\n\r\nsports  organisations.  In  its  policy  of  promoting\r\n\r\nsports  the  Government  has been  giving  income  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions   to   donors   who   donate   to   sports\r\n\r\norganisations.  On  the  other  hand  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  taxing  such  organisations   on   all\r\n\r\ndonations. For example, the Singapore Amateur Swimming\r\n\r\nAssociation  is  one  sports  organisation  which   is\r\n\r\npromoting  sports and has won many laurels abroad  for\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, it has the support of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore and large sums of money have been donated\r\n\r\nto  this  sports  association  for  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nswimming. Yet the Government taxes the donations. Last\r\n\r\nyear, the tax on' this Association amounted  to  some\r\n\r\n$20,000.  This  should not be so. It  means  that  the\r\n\r\nconcession  generously promised by the  Government  is\r\n\r\nnow  taken back by the Government. With one  hand  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is giving this concession, but  with  the\r\n\r\nother hand it is taking it back. This shows a lack  of\r\n\r\nsincerity in Government's intention to promote sports.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nwill   consider  exempting  taxes  on   these   sports\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, will the Minister waive income tax on civic\r\n\r\norganisations  which  offer scholarships  and  sponsor\r\n\r\nwelfare  funds,  and give tax concessions  to  donors?\r\n\r\nThese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisations  have  contributed much  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\neducation,  culture and in the social welfare  fields.\r\n\r\nThey  are  also  helping  the Government  by  awarding\r\n\r\nscholarships  to produce many useful people  to  serve\r\n\r\nthe  country.  In view of this, the Government  should\r\n\r\nencourage  these  civic organisations  and  donors  by\r\n\r\nrelieving  taxes on them particularly  on  scholarship\r\n\r\ndonations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Son:</b> As was stated in 1970, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  prepared to consider  applications  to\r\n\r\namend  approved  private  provident  fund  schemes  to\r\n\r\nenable  members  to  withdraw their contributions  for\r\n\r\npurchase of HDB flats on terms similar to those of the\r\n\r\nCPF. I regret that there should have been difficulties\r\n\r\nin  implementing  this intention.

To   obviate  any  applications   from   being\r\n\r\noverlooked,   perhaps  the  Member  can  request   any\r\n\r\nparticular  interested  fund  to  reapply  for  formal\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Member for Sembawang's questions,\r\n\r\nthe  Member may recollect that when I first  announced\r\n\r\nthe  relief  to  taxpayers for supporting  parents  or\r\n\r\ngrandparents,  the  tax deduction was  only  $300  per\r\n\r\ndependant.  After careful consideration I  raised  the\r\n\r\nrelief  by  more  than  the  100%  which  he  is   now\r\n\r\nsuggesting  I  should  do. I raised  it  to  $750  per\r\n\r\ndependant effective from the year of assessment  1975.\r\n\r\nI  should point out that the tax inducement by  itself\r\n\r\nwill  not reverse the trend on the breaking up of  the\r\n\r\nextended  family system in Singapore. Social  planners\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps  now try to find a  solution  to  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  I  am afraid I will not be able to  consider\r\n\r\nraising  the  present relief of  $750  to  $1,500  per\r\n\r\ndependent parent or grandparent that he suggests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that charitable or sports\r\n\r\norganisations  be exempted from income  tax.  I  would\r\n\r\npoint out that charitable organisations generally  are\r\n\r\nalready tax exempt under Section 13(1)(g) of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Act provided they spend 80% of  their  net\r\n\r\nincome  on approved charitable projects, in any  given\r\n\r\nyear   of  assessment.  All  donations  to  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations  are deemed as income and would  qualify\r\n\r\nfor tax exemption if the 80% requirement is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports organisations are distinct from charities and\r\n\r\nare more appropriately termed \"clubs\" for purposes  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax.  A club may qualify for tax exemption  if\r\n\r\nmore  than 50% of its gross receipts are derived  from\r\n\r\nentrance  and subscription fees. Some of these  sports\r\n\r\norganisations  which are affiliated to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council  or  the  Singapore  National  Olympic\r\n\r\nCouncil receive more than half of their income as  tax\r\n\r\nexempt donations from their parent bodies and they may\r\n\r\nnot  meet the 50% requirement. They therefore  do  not\r\n\r\nqualify  for  tax exemption but they pay tax  only  on\r\n\r\ntheir  net  income after providing for  all  allowable\r\n\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think the Member asked about the position\r\n\r\nof scholarships on charitable contributions. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  charities are exempted from income tax  subject\r\n\r\nto certain conditions. It therefore does not matter if\r\n\r\nfunds  are expended on scholarships provided there  is\r\n\r\nprovision  in the constitution or in the Articles  and\r\n\r\nMemorandum   of   Understanding  for   awarding   such\r\n\r\nscholarships.  I  must emphasise that the  scholarship\r\n\r\nmust have that element of public benefit, must be made\r\n\r\navailable  to  all  irrespective  of  race,  creed  or\r\n\r\nreligion  and  should not merely be  confined  to  the\r\n\r\nmembers or their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> In view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nfavourable   reply,  I  beg  leave  to   withdraw   my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead DEE 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon.

Could the Minister enlighten  the\r\n\r\nHouse on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the Member is correct in saying\r\n\r\nthat I was wrong when I said that the maximum was  23%\r\n\r\nfor all HDB owner-occupied properties. The position is\r\n\r\nthat in those areas which were at 23% before the rates\r\n\r\nwere  increased, the owner occupiers were  allowed  to\r\n\r\nretain  their 23%. That was the maximum for them.  But\r\n\r\nin  areas  which have been at 36%, like Stirling  Road\r\n\r\nand St. Michael's Road, then there was no question  of\r\n\r\nbringing  this  down. They were in an area  which  was\r\n\r\nrated  at 36%. All the houses in that area were  rated\r\n\r\nat  36%, so they were given the same rate. I think  I\r\n\r\nmisled  the  hon.  Member. I was  myself  misled  into\r\n\r\nthinking that that was the situation: that 23% was the\r\n\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I make a further\r\n\r\ncomment?  The reduction in the property tax  rate  was\r\n\r\nbrought  about some years ago when I brought  up  this\r\n\r\nmatter  on the need to have a uniform rate of property\r\n\r\ntax  for HDB properties. There were at that time other\r\n\r\nproperties  which attracted the rate of 36%,  and  all\r\n\r\nwere  subsequently brought down. As we are all  aware,\r\n\r\nproperty tax is based on whether the property is in  a\r\n\r\nrural,  urban  or  certain divisions.  This  rate  was\r\n\r\nbrought  down to 23% irrespective of where the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  estates are but, unfortunately, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  may be an oversight on the part of the Property\r\n\r\nTax  Department  in  missing out these  two  areas.

The  Memorandum on the Main  and  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates does not give us any clue as to what the new\r\n\r\nprojects  are and we must, therefore, ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance to give us a breakdown of the $105 million\r\n\r\ninto  provision  for new projects  and  provision  for\r\n\r\nunder-estimation for on-going projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding under-estimation for project cost, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask a few more questions:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When funds for projects are under-estimated, is\r\n\r\nthere  a  re-evaluation of the  cost-benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nprojects before additional funds are disbursed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are the reasons for the underestimation\r\n\r\nthoroughly  investigated for each and  every  case  of\r\n\r\nsignificant underestimation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the business world, good estimates are\r\n\r\ncritical  to  profits. When companies or firms  tender\r\n\r\nfor  a  contract,  they must stand by  their  tendered\r\n\r\nprice. Thus, whether they end up with a profit or loss\r\n\r\ndepends on whether they have correctly estimated their\r\n\r\nown  costs in the first place. Part of the problem  in\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  of  allocating Government  development\r\n\r\nfunds  is that Ministries and departments do not  have\r\n\r\nto   produce   balance   sheets  and   profit-and-loss\r\n\r\nstatements. Thus, under-estimation, which in  business\r\n\r\nnormally  results in a loss, is not penalised.  Can  a\r\n\r\nsystem  be  worked out to monitor the  performance  of\r\n\r\ndepartments in estimating the costs of their  projects\r\n\r\nwith   a  view  to  improving  the  quality  of   such\r\n\r\nestimates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Where departments frequently underestimate, is\r\n\r\nany attempt made to investigate and understand the\r\n\r\nattitude of the people making the estimates with a\r\n\r\nview to establishing a better rapport? In a company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  financial  controller  or  chief  executive  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  ability and  mental  make-up  of  his\r\n\r\nstaff,  and where cases of non-achievement are  known,\r\n\r\nas  in the case of a bad estimate, we must search  for\r\n\r\nclues behind the failure to perform. The investigation\r\n\r\ninto  the  attitude of his managers is often  a  first\r\n\r\ntask.  I believe the human factor should similarly  be\r\n\r\ngiven due weight in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make it clear that I am not\r\n\r\ncriticising  the  Budget Division of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  or  the user departments concerned  for  poor\r\n\r\nperformance  in fund allocation - not in  this  debate\r\n\r\nanyway  as  I do not have actual examples  of  callous\r\n\r\nunder-estimation.  I am just being  academic.  To  me,\r\n\r\nunder-estimation   is  as  much   a   flaw   as   poor\r\n\r\nimplementation.  It  suggests a  certain  weakness  in\r\n\r\ncontrol. It is a management problem and it would  lead\r\n\r\nto  losses in the business sense. If, for example,  we\r\n\r\ncould  prevent  a loss of $26 million  through  better\r\n\r\nestimation and control, we have an additional argument\r\n\r\nfor income tax reliefs to be increased!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the provision in subhead BAA\r\n\r\n8102  has  been increased because of a change  in  the\r\n\r\nprocedure   for  submission  of  proposals   for   new\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects. Under the  previous  procedure,\r\n\r\nproposals  for  new  development projects  had  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  in  time for consideration for  the  annual\r\n\r\nEstimates. Owing to the great number of proposals that\r\n\r\nwere   submitted  for  consideration  and  the   tight\r\n\r\nschedule that had to be met to ensure that the  annual\r\n\r\nEstimates  were  presented  to  Parliament  in   time,\r\n\r\ninevitably only a cursory assessment of the  proposals\r\n\r\ncould  be  undertaken. For those  that  merit  further\r\n\r\nconsideration,    the    allocation    was     entered\r\n\r\nprovisionally in the annual Estimates subject  to  the\r\n\r\napproval of the Development Planning Committee. In the\r\n\r\ncourse of the new financial year, the Budget Division,\r\n\r\nin  consultation  with the Ministries concerned, then\r\n\r\nmade a more thorough assessment of these proposals and\r\n\r\nappropriate  recommendations  were  put  up   to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the situation whereby projects\r\n\r\ninvolving  Government policy are entered  without  the\r\n\r\nproper approval and also to reduce the workload at the\r\n\r\npeak  of the Budget period as well as to allow a  more\r\n\r\nthorough  assessment of development proposals,  a  new\r\n\r\nprocedure  has been introduced. Henceforth, Ministries\r\n\r\nwill submit proposals for new development projects  at\r\n\r\nany  time  during the financial year. Such development\r\n\r\nprojects will then be processed in the normal way  and\r\n\r\nbecause  the rush of preparing the Budget is  avoided,\r\n\r\nmore accurate estimates can be obtained. The vote has,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  been increased as funds for  new  projects\r\n\r\nare  no longer provided under each Ministry's head  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Projects  approved  in  the  course   of\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1977 will, therefore, be met from  this\r\n\r\nvote  in  the  first  instance and  in  the  following\r\n\r\nfinancial year the approved projects will be shown  in\r\n\r\nthe  annual Estimates under the appropriate Ministry's\r\n\r\nhead   of   expenditure.  New  development   proposals\r\n\r\nreceived  before  the  Budget exercise  totalled  $147\r\n\r\nmillion and therefore the provision for this vote  has\r\n\r\nbeen increased by about $100 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the questions which the Member asked,\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure whether I have got them correctly.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the case of under-estimation. I think  a  new\r\n\r\ncost-benefit  analysis, if this is necessary, can  be\r\n\r\ndone  and  is  done before it goes in the  form  of  a\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to the Development Planning  Committee\r\n\r\nfor approval of the additional allocation of funds. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it is very desirable if one can keep  to  the\r\n\r\nprices  which are originally estimated,  but  this  is\r\n\r\nvery often impossible because certain factors have not\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  into account. For example, if  the  load-bearing   qualities  of  the  soil   are   not   known\r\n\r\nbeforehand,  there is no way in which we  can  prevent\r\n\r\nestimates for piling to be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to getting a better rapport with departments that\r\n\r\nunder-estimate.  I hope this will be achieved  by  our\r\n\r\nnew Budget procedures where we will have a performance-oriented  budget. People in Ministries  will  have  to\r\n\r\nexplain   why  they  have  over-estimated  or   under-estimated, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfailure  or lack of performance will bring its penalty\r\n\r\nin  the  appropriations in the  following  year  which\r\n\r\nwould be in accordance with the performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the reply\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister  and  I beg  leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before I call on the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, may I remind\r\n\r\nMembers   that  it  is  only  10  minutes  away   from\r\n\r\nguillotine time and there are three other Members  who\r\n\r\nhave put down amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head X be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead CAA 8101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for this subhead last year was\r\n\r\n$250,000.

The JTC\r\n\r\nhas,  therefore, offered 730 units of three-room flats\r\n\r\nin  Boon  Lay Garden to the Housing Board for sale  to\r\n\r\nthose on its waiting list for the Telok Blangah. Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah   and   the  Rural  West  zones.  In   addition,\r\n\r\nrecognising   the  increased  personal   mobility   of\r\n\r\nworkers, the JTC has opened applications for its flats\r\n\r\nto  those  working around Jurong, that is, within  the\r\n\r\narea  bounded by Choa Chu Kang Road. Bukit Timah  Road\r\n\r\nand Clementi Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clogged drains and untidy open spaces were caused by\r\n\r\ndebris  from  renovation works  carried  out  by  flat\r\n\r\nowners  and unsatisfactory performance by the previous\r\n\r\nconservancy contractors. Most of the renovation  works\r\n\r\nhave  now been completed. The unsatisfactory condition\r\n\r\nof  lifts in certain flats was due to poor maintenance\r\n\r\nservices  by  one  of  the  lift  companies.  However.\r\n\r\nmaintenance  services have improved and the  frequency\r\n\r\nof breakdowns reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Jurong, the Corporation\r\n\r\nhas  no immediate plans to build more five-room  flats\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  Town  as  there are now  sufficient  flats\r\n\r\navailable, including those under construction, to meet\r\n\r\nthe  demand for the immediate future. Secondly, it may\r\n\r\nbe uneconomical as well as a duplication of effort for\r\n\r\nthe  JTC to produce another publication similar to the\r\n\r\nHousing Board publication of Our Home. However,  as  a\r\n\r\nservice to its tenants and lessees, the Corporation is\r\n\r\nnegotiating  with  the Housing  Board  for  the  joint\r\n\r\nproduction  of the magazine, Our Home. As negotiations\r\n\r\nare  in  their final stages, the distribution  of  the\r\n\r\njoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmagazine to the residents in Jurong Town may be\r\n\r\nexpected in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a programme was drawn up late last year for\r\n\r\nmore  regular  cleansing of water  tanks.  Under  this\r\n\r\nprogramme water tanks are flushed every six months and\r\n\r\nrepainted   every  five  years.  Whenever   necessary,\r\n\r\nflushing or repainting may be carried out earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there is a regular programme for\r\n\r\nrepainting  of  flats every five years. In  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the programme. 18 blocks of flats were repainted\r\n\r\nin  1975 and 17 blocks of flats in 1976. This year  16\r\n\r\nblocks are scheduled for repainting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, resettlement cases are already being\r\n\r\naccorded  priority in the allocation  of  shop  houses\r\n\r\nthat fall vacant. Tendering of shops is done only when\r\n\r\nthere  is no demand by resettlers or when resettlement\r\n\r\ncases  wish  to  use the shops for  trade  or  service\r\n\r\nalready adequately provided in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua:</b> I withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ho\r\n\r\nKah Leong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the sum to be allocated for Head X be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead DAA 8201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $809,006,590 for Head X ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $659,280,000 for Head X ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head J -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P.

This unit is doing its best to control\r\n\r\nand overcome the various problems of pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has been stated recently that air\r\n\r\npollution  in  our  country is on  the  increase.  The\r\n\r\npresence of smog has been found in some parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland.  This  could  be due to pollution  created  by\r\n\r\nsmoke from the numerous industries scattered all  over\r\n\r\nour   island,  power  stations, vehicles  and   other\r\n\r\npolluting agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this Unit has set certain guidelines to\r\n\r\nindustries to eradicate pollution. It is noticed  that\r\n\r\na  number of industries have been reluctant to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  anti-pollution measures. Why is this so? Perhaps\r\n\r\na study could be made to find out why these industries\r\n\r\nare violating the regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps should be taken now to rectify the problem,\r\n\r\notherwise  it would endanger the health of our  people\r\n\r\nin  later years, when remedial action may be too  late\r\n\r\nor expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I am replying on behalf  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1971 the Anti-Pollution Unit has been\r\n\r\nmonitoring  the air for various pollutants  which  may\r\n\r\nhave  direct or indirect effects on health. While  the\r\n\r\nsmoke  level has decreased, other pollutants  such  as\r\n\r\nsulphur dioxide have increased. This is mainly due  to\r\n\r\nthe   increase  in  the  consumption  of  oil  by  our\r\n\r\nindustries, power stations and motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some factories have refused to comply or have been\r\n\r\nreluctant to comply because it increases their  costs.\r\n\r\nBecause of the bad period in the past year we have not\r\n\r\nbeen  rather strict in enforcement, but in the  future\r\n\r\nwe will have to take stricter measures.\r\n\r\n`The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs\r\n\r\nIvan Baptist and Ahmad Haleem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, of course, air pollution is caused by  poor\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and operation of plant and equipment.  In\r\n\r\norder  not  to affect the viability of some  of  these\r\n\r\nindustries, adequate time has been allowed  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  anti-pollution  measures.  But  Members  may  be\r\n\r\ninterested  to  know that in 1976, the Unit  inspected\r\n\r\nover  900 factories to ensure that preventive as  well\r\n\r\nas  palliative  measures are  taken  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\npollution of the air. Tests were also carried  out  in\r\n\r\nvarious  factories to check on dust and acid emissions\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  they  do not  exceed  the  specified\r\n\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that the Unit\r\n\r\nhas recently acquired more sophisticated equipment and\r\n\r\nhas been able to detect the presence of ozone which is\r\n\r\nthe  main  constituent  of  photochemical  oxidant  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  called  photochemical  smog.  Photochemical\r\n\r\noxidants  are  detected on some hot  days  during  the\r\n\r\nafternoon  and  are  formed  by  the  interaction   of\r\n\r\npollutants such as hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen\r\n\r\nwhich  are emitted by motor vehicles, factories, power\r\n\r\nstations and all combustion processes. The reaction in\r\n\r\nthe atmosphere is very complex and it also depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  condition of the atmosphere such as  temperature,\r\n\r\nrelative humidity, wind and the relative concentration\r\n\r\nof  the pollutants. This oxidant disappears as the sun\r\n\r\ngoes down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, the Unit is at present studying\r\n\r\nthe  position  in  detail and  may  introduce  control\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  reduce  the  emission  of  some  of  the\r\n\r\npollutants  such  as hydrocarbons  which  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nbefore were the precursors to photochemical smog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am befuddled with the way\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  has  handled  this  matter.

I am sure the House would like  to\r\n\r\nbe  enlightened on the targets that the Anti-Pollution\r\n\r\nUnit  has set itself and the programmes it has in mind\r\n\r\nto achieve its targets. What bothers me is haw targets\r\n\r\nare  to  be  met  when one compares in  the  Main  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates FY 76 and FY 77 that staff  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced by 5.4% and EOM and OOE increased  by  a\r\n\r\nmere 6% and 3% respectively.

It has got no targets. The target  in  one\r\n\r\nrespect  has been fixed by the Prime Minister who  has\r\n\r\nasked  to clean up the Singapore River and the Kallang\r\n\r\nRiver and set the target date of 10 years within which\r\n\r\nhe  wants  to  see fish swimming in these two  rivers.\r\n\r\nThat settles the water question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air, again we do not have any targets. The\r\n\r\nair  is  not so bad that we have got to clean  it  up,\r\n\r\nsay, within five or 10 years. The objective is to keep\r\n\r\nthe  air  we breathe as clean as it is today  or  even\r\n\r\ncleaner.  With  the  introduction of  industries  into\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the  air  is  being  polluted   by   many\r\n\r\nindustries  and the work of the Unit is  to  see  that\r\n\r\nthis  pollution in the air does not become so bad that\r\n\r\nyou and I cannot safely breathe the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Clean Air Act and the Water Pollution and\r\n\r\nDrainage  Act set out the requirements on the emission\r\n\r\nof  pollutants and effluent discharges from  premises.\r\n\r\nOur  basic  approach to the solution of air and  water\r\n\r\npollution  problems  is to deal with  them  at  source\r\n\r\nthrough  preventive and palliative measures.  This  is\r\n\r\ncomplemented  by  public  education  on  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  and minimise environmental pollution  and  by\r\n\r\nenforcement action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New industries are carefully screened to ensure that\r\n\r\nthey are not too polluting and are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarefully   located   in  industrial   areas   without\r\n\r\nadversely affecting residential estates. Both new  and\r\n\r\nexisting  industries  are required  to  install  anti-pollution  equipment, improve on  their  house-keeping\r\n\r\nand  operation in order to reduce air pollution.  They\r\n\r\nare  also required to use the best practical means  to\r\n\r\ncontrol noxious emissions from their factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water pollution, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nhas  a section in the Sewerage Department to deal with\r\n\r\nthis problem. For some years now it has embarked on  a\r\n\r\nprogramme   to   prevent  and  control  discharge   of\r\n\r\nwastewater  into  the  open  drains  and  canals  from\r\n\r\ndomestic, trade and industrial premises  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfrom farms. This section also advises house-owners how\r\n\r\nto  divert  wastewater  from  their  premises  to  the\r\n\r\nsewers,  and the industries on how to deal with  trade\r\n\r\neffluent. This keeps the Chairman of the PUB happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective method of controlling water\r\n\r\npollution is the extension of sewerage to all premises\r\n\r\nand to ensure that wastewater goes into sewers and not\r\n\r\ninto open drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to use the word \"target\", the target is to\r\n\r\nsewer the whole island finally. But it is not an  easy\r\n\r\nprocess  nor  is it an easy process to  clean  up  the\r\n\r\nKallang and Singapore Rivers. However, the Member  can\r\n\r\nrest  assured that a plan is being worked out to  meet\r\n\r\nthis  target set by the Prime Minister. Many  run-down\r\n\r\nareas in the older parts of the city would have to  be\r\n\r\nredeveloped. Open markets and street hawkers  must  be\r\n\r\ncleared  and resited to proper premises where sewerage\r\n\r\nand other sanitary facilities are available. Only then\r\n\r\ncan refuse be systematically collected and disposed of\r\n\r\nand wastewater properly channelled into the sewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member will agree that though the\r\n\r\nGovernment   can  provide  sanitary  facilities,   the\r\n\r\nultimate  success  in  our  clean-up  programme  would\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the  cooperation of every  member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  No  litter  should be  thrown  or  wastewater\r\n\r\ndischarged indiscriminately into our open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrains.  Only then can our canals and rivers  be  free\r\n\r\nfrom pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the employment position, the Member has\r\n\r\nquoted  some  figures. I am afraid I do not  have  the\r\n\r\nanswers to those figures. All I can assure the  Member\r\n\r\nis  that there has been no reduction in staff in  this\r\n\r\nUnit. There are a few vacancies but the positions  are\r\n\r\nstill  there.

In addition to this, many who were listed\r\n\r\nin  the  electoral registers did not  receive  polling\r\n\r\ncards  and  others  who voted in 1972  were  left  out\r\n\r\ncompletely  in the 1976 electoral registers, although\r\n\r\nthey voted in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you. Sir, further illustrations of the\r\n\r\nhaphazard  situation that must exist in the  Elections\r\n\r\nOffice.   Husbands  were  sent  to  different  polling\r\n\r\nstations  and  even different constituencies  to  vote\r\n\r\nalthough  they  lived in the constituency  with  their\r\n\r\nspouses  for goodness knows how many years.  Why  this\r\n\r\nattempt  to  separate  husbands and  wives?  Why  this\r\n\r\ninconvenience? It is a well-known and established fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  is cheaper and more convenient for  both  to\r\n\r\naccompany  each other to the same polling  station  in\r\n\r\nthe  correct constituency, the constituency they  have\r\n\r\nestablished house in and established relationship with\r\n\r\ntheir MPs. I have definite instances. Take Mr Fok  Yew\r\n\r\nWoon,  for  instance. He lives in  Potong  Pasir.  14H\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon Road. He was asked to vote in Aljunied\r\n\r\nI, Playfair Road School. Burn Road. His wife living in\r\n\r\nthe  same  house  was  sent to  Upper  Serangoon  III,\r\n\r\nCharlton   School.  Aroozoo  Avenue  -  both   rightly\r\n\r\nconstituents of Potong Pasir, mind you. Sir.

In   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  open  canvassing  went  on  in   polling\r\n\r\nstations,  with  or  without  the  knowledge  of   the\r\n\r\nPresiding  Officers.  In one instance,  the  Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficer  in  charge was aware of the  open  canvassing\r\n\r\nthat went on in his polling station, but no action was\r\n\r\ntaken   against  the  culprit  concerned.  In  another\r\n\r\ninstance, the Presiding Officer was not only not aware\r\n\r\nof  the  open  canvassing that went on in the  polling\r\n\r\nstation  under  his charge but had  mistaken  the  two\r\n\r\ncanvassers to be his assistants. As I did not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  too harsh with the two incidents I encountered  at\r\n\r\nthese two polling stations. I brought only one case to\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of  the police who  subsequently  took\r\n\r\naction  against the culprit. The culprit was  recently\r\n\r\nfined  $300  for  illegally  carrying  out  canvassing\r\n\r\nactivities  within 200 metres of a polling station  on\r\n\r\npolling day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two incidents that I had highlighted, it\r\n\r\nappeared   that  the  Presiding  Officers   were   not\r\n\r\nsufficiently alert in enforcing the rules strictly and\r\n\r\neffectively to prevent such incidents from  happening.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  that the same incidents also occurred  in\r\n\r\npolling  stations  in  other  constituencies  on  23rd\r\n\r\nDecember,  1  976. I wonder what steps  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment will take to ensure that a stricter control\r\n\r\nis  exercised to prevent such malpractices in'  future\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I do not think the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nneeds  an  answer  from me.

This happens in all elections.\r\n\r\nPeople get excited and sometimes they do worse things,\r\n\r\nat  least in this country no one has died as a  result\r\n\r\nof an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Potong Pasir, perhaps I could\r\n\r\npoint  out to him that cases of persons having  to  go\r\n\r\nand  vote  in  another constituency  or  of  names  of\r\n\r\npersons  not on the register need not arise  if  these\r\n\r\npeople  had  gone to check the registers  of  electors\r\n\r\nwhen  they were exhibited. The errors in the registers\r\n\r\ncould  have been rectified then. As the Member himself\r\n\r\nhas   pointed  out.  \"there  was  not  enough   time\",\r\n\r\n\"standing in the rain\" and \"there is no place  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre\",  but as  far  as  I  remember  the\r\n\r\nposition was this. The registers were exhibited over a\r\n\r\nperiod  of time. People could not be bothered to  find\r\n\r\nout  whether their names were there. Then some  bright\r\n\r\nspark  started a rumour in Singapore, a rumour to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that if you did not vote, then not only  would\r\n\r\nyou  not have the chance to vote, but cancellation  or\r\n\r\nabsence of your name from the register of voters would\r\n\r\nhave   disastrous  results  like  the  loss  of   your\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  followed by loss of your  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat, and  followed by lots of other privileges  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens have. As a result of this  rumour,\r\n\r\nand  rumour spreads very quickly in Singapore, all the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres were jammed with worried  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  That  was the position.  They  checked  too\r\n\r\nlate. As a result the Government had to come out  with\r\n\r\nan  announcement that none of these evils would befall\r\n\r\nanybody  if his name was not on the register.  All  it\r\n\r\nmeant was that he could not vote. He could always have\r\n\r\nhis  name restored in the register if he has  a  valid\r\n\r\nexcuse for non-voting or pay a sum of $5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has given the names and addresses of some\r\n\r\nof his constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> They are not all my constituents\r\n\r\naccording  to the polling cards sent by the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is not possible for me to give an\r\n\r\nanswer  to his questions as to why they were left  out\r\n\r\nor why they had to vote in another constituency unless\r\n\r\nthe circumstances of their cases are looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should tell Members how the registers of\r\n\r\nelectors are compiled from the records of the National\r\n\r\nRegistration Office.

It is no use having a nomination form  and\r\n\r\njust  putting a PAP candidate. So those ballot  papers\r\n\r\ncannot go out to the constituents until Nomination Day\r\n\r\nand  the  papers  have been printed in the  Government\r\n\r\nPrinting Office.

This could not be avoided\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the increased cost of production.  Whilst\r\n\r\naccepting the reasons for the increased charges, it is\r\n\r\nalso observed that the PUB has, replaced new meters in\r\n\r\ncertain homes and places. The reason for changing  the\r\n\r\nmeters  is  that  they  are not functioning  properly.\r\n\r\nHowever, these new meters have produced heavy bills to\r\n\r\nthe  consumers. I understand that in every  new  meter\r\n\r\nfor  electricity an extra 1% is turned on in  the  set\r\n\r\nprior  to  installation. Why must  this  extra  1%  be\r\n\r\ncharged to the consumers whose old meters were removed\r\n\r\nby the PUB? Even the gas meters have resulted in heavy\r\n\r\nbills. These increases are due to the installation  of\r\n\r\nnew  meters. Sir, the question is, if old  meters  are\r\n\r\nnot   functioning  properly,  why   not   repair   and\r\n\r\nrecondition them, instead of replacing them  with  new\r\n\r\nones?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PUB gas is frequently used in homes,\r\n\r\nthere  is a tendency of the gas leaking from  the  gas\r\n\r\npipe  though  the appliance is not in use.  This  leak\r\n\r\nwill  increase the gas consumption. Could the PUB  not\r\n\r\nthink  of  a system whereby the gas will not seep  off\r\n\r\nwhen it is not in use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a speculation that the authorities are\r\n\r\nconsidering the use of only piped gas supplied by  the\r\n\r\nPUB  for  cooking  appliances.  This  is  because   of\r\n\r\naccidents  or dangers posed by gas supplied  by  other\r\n\r\nmeans. Could a clarification on this be given?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that after a major power failure on\r\n\r\nlast   Deepavali  Eve,  there  were  scattered   power\r\n\r\nbreakdowns  in certain areas of the island  every  now\r\n\r\nand then. Why is this so? Is it because the faults  of\r\n\r\nthat  major  power  failure  have  not  been  properly\r\n\r\nrectified?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when the rates of public utilities are\r\n\r\nbeing  reviewed,  I  suggest  that  if  there  is  any\r\n\r\nsurcharge  on  the new bills, it should not  apply  to\r\n\r\nappliances hired from the PUB,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, it is with considerable interest\r\n\r\nthat I note the reply to the Oral Question raised by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jurong in regard to the salt content of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater  supply  in  Jurong.

I  believe  it  is   not\r\n\r\nnecessary for water to be only safe to drink but  also\r\n\r\nreasonably  attractive to drink. It  should  be  cool.\r\n\r\nclear, colourless and free from disagreeable odour and\r\n\r\ntaste, apart from being free from organisms and faecal\r\n\r\npollution   and   a   control  of  pesticide   levels.\r\n\r\nradiological activity and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely this.

This was  followed  in 1916  by  Great Britain, 1917 by USA and all  through\r\n\r\nthe periods between the two world wars -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, on a point of order, I\r\n\r\ndo not see the relevance in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I suppose the relevance is that it\r\n\r\nwould  be a saving of energy, and the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard also generates electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> But, Sir, the Member has not come\r\n\r\nto it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I will be coming to it. The\r\n\r\nreason  for the historical background is to point  out\r\n\r\nthat,  in all these periods where daylight saving  had\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced, it had proved to  be  able  to  save\r\n\r\npower.  During  the Second World War, daylight  saving\r\n\r\nwas  again adopted for the purpose of conserving  fuel\r\n\r\nand coal, After the war, many countries continued with\r\n\r\ndaylight  saving  for  the same  purpose,  mainly  the\r\n\r\nEuropean countries. China and many other countries  in\r\n\r\nthe  tropics followed, including Ghana, Sarawak, North\r\n\r\nKorea, Malaysia, and also Singapore. We do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave half an hour daylight saving currently in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members are not aware of this, let me explain.\r\n\r\nThe  manner in which time zones are calculated is that\r\n\r\nevery  1  5o  Longitude equals one hour. Singapore  is\r\n\r\n103o East Longitude.\r\n\r\nand  so  we  should be seven hours ahead of  Greenwich\r\n\r\nMean  Time (GMT). If Members check up, they will  find\r\n\r\nthat  we  are instead 7? hours ahead of GMT. Singapore\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, currently saving daylight by  half  an\r\n\r\nhour.  This was introduced just after the Second World\r\n\r\nWar.  Again  in  1968  the United  Kingdom  introduced\r\n\r\ndaylight  saving for the whole year round.  But  after\r\n\r\nthe  Yomkipur  War,  as a way of saving  fuel  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, in 1974 daylight saving was introduced\r\n\r\nall  year round for the whole nation as an experiment.\r\n\r\nThis stopped in 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I am saying is that daylight saving is nothing\r\n\r\nnew  to Singapore. We have had daylight saving. We are\r\n\r\nstill  saving daylight presently. I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nif  the  Hon.  Minister for National  Development  and\r\n\r\nCommunications would investigate and consider  further\r\n\r\ndaylight  saving if it could usefully  conserve  fuel.\r\n\r\nMany members of the public have been complaining about\r\n\r\nthe  PUB  charges.  Maybe  with  the  introduction  of\r\n\r\ndaylight  saving,  we could save some  money  for  the\r\n\r\npublic and also foreign exchange for Singapore in  the\r\n\r\ncosts of the fuel that we import.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon is not here. Mr\r\n\r\nTeong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have only\r\n\r\ntwo simple questions to ask the Minister. The first is\r\n\r\nthat I have received many complaints from the electors\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  high increase in PUB charges.  In  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, a consumer has his PUB bill increased by\r\n\r\nnearly  100%  in three years. That is  to  say,  three\r\n\r\nyears ago his PUB bill was about $100. Nowadays, it is\r\n\r\nabout $200. I would like the Minister to clarify  this\r\n\r\npoint.  Is  it possible to increase the rate  100%  in\r\n\r\nthree  years when his rate of consumption remains  the\r\n\r\nsame?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the fixing of water\r\n\r\nmeters  in  hawker centres. At present, there  is  one\r\n\r\nmeter for every four hawkers. Some hawkers complain to\r\n\r\nme that this is very inconvenient, because some stalls\r\n\r\nuse  more water and some use less but they have to pay\r\n\r\na  pro  rata rate. Therefore, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider the feasibility of  fixing  one\r\n\r\nmeter for each hawker stall. The Minister concerned is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development and he is  also\r\n\r\nthe Chairman of the Public Utilities Board. Therefore,\r\n\r\nhe  should fully understand the problems of both sides\r\n\r\nand be able to compromise. I hope he will give serious\r\n\r\nconsideration to this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  shall take the last speaker first. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang has complained again about increase  in\r\n\r\nPUB  water  charges. The water rate,  of  course,  has\r\n\r\nincreased.  I do not know whether or not  he  realises\r\n\r\nthat  costs  have increased and, as I have  repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  are  going into unconventional  sources  of\r\n\r\nwater  supply. Water is more polluted and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe cost of treatment is high. Moreover, to discourage\r\n\r\nwastage of water, water rates are now calculated on  a\r\n\r\nblock basis. Every family is given a basic block of 25\r\n\r\ncubic metres. (I am not too sure of this figure). That\r\n\r\nis  the first block to which every family is entitled,\r\n\r\nand   it  is  charged  at  a  certain  rate.  If   the\r\n\r\nconsumption  goes  beyond the first  block,  the  rate\r\n\r\nincreases  and  if  it  still  goes  beyond  that, it\r\n\r\nincreases   still  further.  Therefore, though   the\r\n\r\nconsumption of water, in the case he has referred  to,\r\n\r\nremains the same, the consumer has to pay more because\r\n\r\nof  increasing charges and perhaps also because of the\r\n\r\nblock rates. There is no over-charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question of the hawkers wanting a meter\r\n\r\neach.  I  think  we  have more  than  half  a  million\r\n\r\naccounts  at  the  moment.  Hon.  Members  have   been\r\n\r\ncomplaining about mistakes made in reading  meters  by\r\n\r\nmeter  readers. In the case of hawkers, we  are  going\r\n\r\nout of our way to supply one meter for every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour hawkers. I think for their convenience surely the\r\n\r\nfour  hawkers  can come to some sort of  an  agreement\r\n\r\namong  themselves to share PUB charges. Only when  and\r\n\r\nif  hawkers  and members of the public  can  read  the\r\n\r\nmeters  themselves,  and when we have  enough  meters.\r\n\r\nwill the position be reconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very indebted to the hon. Member for the short\r\n\r\nhistory of daylight saving. His suggestion is that  if\r\n\r\nwe  further advance the clock in Singapore we may save\r\n\r\non  fuel.  The maximum difference in time in Singapore\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  year is 45 minutes, We  have  already\r\n\r\nadvanced  the  clock by half an hour.  If  we  further\r\n\r\nadvance the clock, I am afraid that instead of  saving\r\n\r\nmoney on fuel we may have to spend more money on  fuel\r\n\r\nbecause  people  will have to wake up earlier  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning when it is still dark to prepare breakfast for\r\n\r\ntheir  children  going  to school.  I  think  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  the maximum in daylight saving by  advancing\r\n\r\nthe  clock by half an hour. Daylight saving  has  been\r\n\r\nmost  useful in countries which have seasonal  changes\r\n\r\nand  where  the difference in time between winter  and\r\n\r\nsummer is quite wide. For his information, let me  say\r\n\r\nthat  we have already considered the position  and  we\r\n\r\nthink  that  half an hour is the maximum that  we  can\r\n\r\nachieve  without adversely disrupting the economy  and\r\n\r\nsocial habits and customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the Member for Potong Pasir has\r\n\r\ngiven  me the chance to further elaborate on  what  is\r\n\r\nmeant by WHO drinking water standard. The WHO drinking\r\n\r\nwater  standards which I have mentioned in this  House\r\n\r\nas  well as in my address at the opening of the  Upper\r\n\r\nPeirce  Reservoir recently, are parameters recommended\r\n\r\nby  the  World Health Organisation in its publication,\r\n\r\n\"International  Standards  for  Drinking   Water.\"   I\r\n\r\nbelieve that by his very eloquent description  of  how\r\n\r\ndrinking  water should look and taste, he can probably\r\n\r\nadd   greatly   to  the  publication,   However, the\r\n\r\nparameters  mentioned by the World Health Organisation\r\n\r\nare  purely  technical  and they  relate  to  chemical\r\n\r\nsubstances in drinking water for domestic use. Besides\r\n\r\nsalinity, colour and organic contents of water, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso mention the limits for other chemical substances,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese\r\n\r\nand  sulphate.  I suppose that if these  comprise  the\r\n\r\nminimum  content  of water, it would  have  a  certain\r\n\r\ntaste.  If this is exceeded, of course, the  water  is\r\n\r\nunpalatable. There is also a recommended limit for  ph\r\n\r\nvalue of water as well as its hardness. The quality of\r\n\r\ntreated water from the Kranji and Pandan reservoirs is\r\n\r\nwell within this limit. If the Member for Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nis really interested, I can give him a copy of the WHO\r\n\r\nrecommended limits of chemical substances in  drinking\r\n\r\nwater for domestic use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to my very good friend, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson. I should first speak on the subject which I had\r\n\r\noccasion to refer to previously. I have here a copy of\r\n\r\na  PUB  bill which I believe everyone must have  seen.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  PUB  bill [indicating].  I  believe  most\r\n\r\nMembers  must  have handled it at one time  or  other,\r\n\r\nexcept  those who are fortunate enough to  have  their\r\n\r\nbills paid by someone else. I think Members must  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  look at the bill closely, otherwise they would\r\n\r\nnot  have  complained  of an  increase  in  the  water\r\n\r\ncharges or that there has been a mistake. If they were\r\n\r\nto  look carefully at the bill, they will see an  item\r\n\r\n\"Government  tax  on  $90.12.\"  I  have  already   had\r\n\r\noccasion to explain that this is not a surcharge. This\r\n\r\nis a Government tax on PUB bills, including rentals on\r\n\r\ngas  or  other  appliances. Much as I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndebate on this Government tax with the hon. Member.  I\r\n\r\ncannot do so because I believe the prerogative belongs\r\n\r\nto my colleague, the Minister for Finance who has said\r\n\r\nin  this  House that, in conjunction with the increase\r\n\r\nin  oil  prices, there would be a review of this  tax.\r\n\r\nMembers  should remember that this is not a surcharge.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  Government tax: The Member can bring  the\r\n\r\nmatter up with the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His complaint was that bills have been heavy. Well.\r\n\r\nif  he  uses more, he pays more. That is a  fact.  The\r\n\r\nhon. Member is right when he says that new electricity\r\n\r\nmeters  are calibrated 1% higher. The reason is  this.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  that  meters  are clock-work machines  and  with\r\n\r\ncontinuous  use  they deteriorate  and  would  not  be\r\n\r\naccurate. And unfortunately for public utility bodies,\r\n\r\nas  meters  deteriorate, they tend to  under-register.\r\n\r\nElectricity meters tend to under-register by  as  much\r\n\r\nas  3%.  Therefore, in the long run  this  is  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the  consumer.  So  for  a  start, the\r\n\r\nelectricity meter is calibrated 1% higher. This is the\r\n\r\npractice  of  most utility bodies. Electricity  meters\r\n\r\nare  not changed until ten years later. So it is  with\r\n\r\nwater  and gas meters. As they deteriorate, we  change\r\n\r\nthem. Either we recondition the meters, if they can be\r\n\r\nreconditioned, or we change them for new  meters.  Gas\r\n\r\nand water meters are changed on the average every four\r\n\r\nto six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding gas leakage, normally there is no gas\r\n\r\nleakage  if the appliance is closed tightly. If  there\r\n\r\nis  leakage, you  can  smell it,  and  when  you  do.\r\n\r\ntelephone  the  PUB immediately. They  will  come  and\r\n\r\nrepair the appliance. In this way, you would not waste\r\n\r\nmoney  through gas leakage. Regarding the  restriction\r\n\r\nin  the  use of gas, the PUB does not want a monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it welcomes the use of liquid petroleum gas.\r\n\r\nHowever, its  use is restricted in food  centres  for\r\n\r\nreason of safety. Hawker centres tend to attract crowd\r\n\r\nand accidents can happen with such gas containers, and\r\n\r\nif  the  containers  of  liquid petroleum  gas  should\r\n\r\nexplode, it could cause a lot of damage and injury. It\r\n\r\nis for safety reasons that the use of liquid petroleum\r\n\r\ngas  is  not  allowed  in hawker centres.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause the PUB wants to monopolise the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for power failures, I have here art article\r\n\r\nentitled \"The Great Blackout of 1960\". In 1976 at 5.50\r\n\r\np.m. the  lights began to flicker in Salt Lake  City.\r\n\r\nThen,  quite  a large part of America was affected.  A\r\n\r\ncommittee  to look into it was formed and  the  report\r\n\r\nhas  just come to hand. The conclusion of this  report\r\n\r\nis  that  \"you  can do everything but  you  can  never\r\n\r\neliminate  blackout\". We have done everything  we  can\r\n\r\nhere.  We cannot eliminate blackout. But the blackouts\r\n\r\nthat we have from time to time are minor ones.
