We can\r\n\r\nonly  give consolation. And if an epitaph were  to\r\n\r\nbe  written, I can find no better phrase than this\r\n\r\nsimple verse from the Rubaiyat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Then said another, \"Surely not in vain\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My substance from the common earth was taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he who subtly wrought me into shape\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should send me back to common earth again.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we lived in an age of despair, then\r\n\r\nlittle else could be said.

And  it  is  with\r\n\r\nfaith  and  hope that the late Member  for  Anson,\r\n\r\nInche Baharuddin, came forward to take part in the\r\n\r\nleadership of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sacrificed security in his old position as a\r\n\r\njournalist in the Utusan Melayu to face insecurity\r\n\r\nas  a  leader of the people. Inche Baharuddin  had\r\n\r\nserved  the people in the City Council and in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. He was rare as a leader.  He\r\n\r\nwas  broadminded  and tolerant in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  tenets of his Islamic faith. He was loyal  to\r\n\r\nthe  people whom he represented, and on  the  very\r\n\r\nevening  of  his death he was with them  in  Anson\r\n\r\nlistening to their complaints and trying  to  find\r\n\r\nan answer to their questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak not as a partisan, not because Inche\r\n\r\nBaharuddin was a member of the P.A.P., but I speak\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  his virtues and  qualities  as  a\r\n\r\nleader  among  the people, as a representative  of\r\n\r\nthe  people who had sat among us in this  Chamber.\r\n\r\nThere  was so much to hope in a man so young,  and\r\n\r\ncan  you blame us if we are bitter that that  hope\r\n\r\nis knocked out without any warning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people today have a great need for leaders\r\n\r\nwho  are  prepared to be self-sacrificing.  If  we\r\n\r\nhope  to  build our budding nation, if we hope  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  our  quest for  building  our  united\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation,  then it is absolutely  necessary\r\n\r\nthat   leaders  from  all  communities  must  work\r\n\r\ntogether   to   achieve   this   purpose.    Inche\r\n\r\nBaharuddin, young as he was, had the faith that  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation could be built. He had  the  hope,\r\n\r\nalthough he did not live to see his faith and hope\r\n\r\nfulfilled,  that the time will come when  we  will\r\n\r\nall  be marching from strength to strength in  our\r\n\r\ntask of nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you have been in this Chamber for the last six years.

Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance whether the Government has any  plans\r\n\r\nfor   giving  economic  assistance  to  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go\r\n\r\ninto  the  details of what the Government  is  now\r\n\r\ndoing   and  what  it  intends  to  do  to  assist\r\n\r\nSingapore  Malays, I wish to outline some  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal features of the economic position of the\r\n\r\nMalays in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any plan for economic assistance must be based on\r\n\r\na  correct appraisal of the present situation  and\r\n\r\npresent  needs.  The  1957 census  gives  us  some\r\n\r\nindications. Unfortunately, the census figures  do\r\n\r\nnot distinguish between Malays and Indonesians  in\r\n\r\nthe  statistics on occupation. But this is only  a\r\n\r\nminor  disadvantage as the broad picture is  clear\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 there were 57,300 Malays and Indonesians\r\n\r\nworking. There were 3,800 stated to be unemployed.\r\n\r\nOf  the  57,300 persons working, a great  majority\r\n\r\nworked  as  employees.  The  number  of  employees\r\n\r\namounted to 51,400. These are the people who  work\r\n\r\nfor  a  wage  or  a salary. There  were  also,  in\r\n\r\naddition,  some 5,900 who were self-employed,  and\r\n\r\nmost  of  these  are fishermen, hawkers  and  such\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first feature about the economic status of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays in Singapore is that a great  majority\r\n\r\nof  them  are paid employees. In this regard,  the\r\n\r\nMalays in Singapore differ fundamentally from  the\r\n\r\nMalays in the Federation where a great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority  are  not employees but are  farmers  and\r\n\r\nfishermen - people who work on their own account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, of the 51,400 employees, no less than\r\n\r\n26,900  are employed by the Government,  statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations,  the City Council  and  the  British\r\n\r\nDefence  Departments. Some  11,300  work  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the City Council, and some  11,800\r\n\r\nwork  for  the  British Defence Departments.  From\r\n\r\nthis  fact,  it therefore follows that  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities in the public service are matters of\r\n\r\ngreat   importance  to  the  Malay   citizens   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. More detailed and up-to-date figures in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   Central  Government   monthly-rated\r\n\r\nemployees  are available. On 31st December,  1959,\r\n\r\nof  22,966 employees in the Central Government, no\r\n\r\nless than 6,908 are Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general standard of living of the\r\n\r\nMalay  population, not much by way of a scientific\r\n\r\nstudy  has  been  made,  although  this  does  not\r\n\r\nprevent  people from hazarding all kinds of  loose\r\n\r\ngeneralisations.  When I was a  civil  servant,  I\r\n\r\ncarried out a study of incomes in Singapore  among\r\n\r\nthe urban working-class population. In 1953/54,  I\r\n\r\nconducted an extensive social survey in  the  City\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to find out the conditions of  those\r\n\r\nfamilies depending on earners whose incomes do not\r\n\r\nexceed  $400 per month each. Some 83 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nSingapore families living in the city fall  within\r\n\r\nthis  income  bracket.  Within  the  survey  group\r\n\r\nwhich,  by  and  large,  represents  what  we  may\r\n\r\nloosely term the working class, the average income\r\n\r\nof  a  Malay family compares well with the others.\r\n\r\nMalay  families earn an average of $160 per  month\r\n\r\nas  against  $148  of the general average.  Within\r\n\r\nthis selected group, that is to say, among\r\n\r\nworking-class  families,  it can be said that  the  notion\r\n\r\nthat  Malays  are worse off than others  does  not\r\n\r\nhold   true.  But  this  proposition   cannot   be\r\n\r\ngeneralised  over the whole strata of society.  If\r\n\r\nwe  include all persons - rich, the well-to-do,  and\r\n\r\nthe poor together - we find that the proportion  of\r\n\r\nMalays  whose incomes are high enough  to  exclude\r\n\r\nthem from the survey is a small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none.  Only  6  per  cent of  Malay  families  have\r\n\r\nearners  receiving an income of $400  a  month  or\r\n\r\nmore  as  against the general average  of  17  per\r\n\r\ncent.  This means that in the urban Malay  society\r\n\r\nthe    number   of   middle-class   persons   with\r\n\r\nprofessional occupations is much smaller than  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  average of all communities. It is  likely\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  people  in  the  rural  areas   are\r\n\r\nincluded,  the picture will not be much different.\r\n\r\nIt  is  against this background that  we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider what action can be taken to maintain  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the  economic welfare of the Malays.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  must  be that employment opportunities  for\r\n\r\nMalays  in the Government service and in statutory\r\n\r\nauthorities  generally should be  maintained,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  vital since more than half of the  Malay\r\n\r\npopulation  are depending on their  livelihood  on\r\n\r\nthis occupation-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

What  has  become  a\r\n\r\nquestion  mark to me is why that amount  is  voted\r\n\r\nfor  Temporary Staff in order to take charge of  a\r\n\r\nnew  department in the interests of the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Would  it not be better  if  permanent\r\n\r\nstaff were recruited, and not initially temporary?\r\n\r\nIf  permanent staff were recruited,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nmade  through  the Public Service  Commission  and\r\n\r\nthen  there would be no doubt in the minds of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   Members.  If,  on  the  other   hand,\r\n\r\ntemporary staff were to be engaged - I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister concerned could enlighten  us\r\n\r\nas  to the reason why - would the temporary staff be\r\n\r\ndrawn  from  members of the Work Brigade  or  from\r\n\r\nsuch members as were favourably considered by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nunderlying  note of the two remarks of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Kembangan is that somebody is going to\r\n\r\ndo  a fiddle over temporary staff. He thought that\r\n\r\na  far better arrangement would be to get this new\r\n\r\ndepartment staffed by permanent officers  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  appointments could be decided by the Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, thereby giving no room for any\r\n\r\npossibility  of  fiddling appointments.  Now,  the\r\n\r\nMember is under a misapprehension. It is not  true\r\n\r\nthat  only  permanent appointments are decided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service Commission. Any  appointment,\r\n\r\ntemporary or otherwise, for a period of two months\r\n\r\nor  more  must  be approved by the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.   The   Public   Service    Commission\r\n\r\nOrdinance is explicit on that score and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  practice which  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nobserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that the reason why we\r\n\r\nare recruiting temporary staff is not that we have\r\n\r\nany  intention to fiddle appointments - that is  not\r\n\r\nthe   way  the  P.A.P.  Government  conducts   its\r\n\r\nbusiness - but  there  is a more simple  explanation\r\n\r\nand  it  is  this.  The operation  of  registering\r\n\r\nbusinesses will probably begin sometime about  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  the  year.  The Bill  introducing  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Registration Tax will be passed  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  before  long, but  until  that  Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed, no work can start. Therefore, in the first\r\n\r\nyear  of operation, this new department will  have\r\n\r\nabout  six  months or less to do  a  whole  year's\r\n\r\nwork.  It is therefore necessary to engage  people\r\n\r\ntemporarily  to tide over this rush. That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason why we have decided to ask the Assembly for\r\n\r\nthis  vote to enable us to engage more staff on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary basis than would be required on a  \r\n\r\nlong-term basis by this department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  understood the Minister to say that this  staff\r\n\r\nwould  be required to register businesses in order\r\n\r\nto  extract  tax. As I appreciate  the  situation,\r\n\r\nthere  is  already  an  organisation  whereby  all\r\n\r\npersons  carrying on businesses in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nrequired    to   register   under   the   Business\r\n\r\nRegistration Ordinance. If that is so,  what  then\r\n\r\nis  the need to employ all this temporary staff to\r\n\r\neffect that registration, because the registration\r\n\r\nshould already have been effected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present\r\n\r\nBusiness  Registration Ordinance  provides  for  a\r\n\r\nonce  and for all registration. Once you register,\r\n\r\nthat  is the end. That department has no more work\r\n\r\nto  do  as  far  as relations with that  firm  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But  in this case, it is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter.  You have to keep in touch with them  year\r\n\r\nby  year.  Every  year, you  have  to  inform  the\r\n\r\nRegistry that they are in existence and that  they\r\n\r\nshould  pay  their tax.

Now,  as   I\r\n\r\nunderstand   it,   there  is  a   Business   Names\r\n\r\nOrdinance - this Ordinance has been in  force  since\r\n\r\n1940 - under which anyone who carries on a  business\r\n\r\nin  Singapore must register. Having registered, he\r\n\r\nmust  also notify the Registrar of Business  Names\r\n\r\nof  the change in partners and that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is  in  existence now a skeleton  staff\r\n\r\nanyway which knows who are the persons carrying on\r\n\r\na  business,  what are the businesses  registered,\r\n\r\nand  where they are situated. Having reached  that\r\n\r\npoint, the next point I take it will be to extract\r\n\r\ntax  from these businesses every year. Now,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what the new Ordinance is going to  say,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, but it seems to me that possibly\r\n\r\na  lot of money could be saved if extensive powers\r\n\r\nwere  given to the Registrar of Business Names  to\r\n\r\ncollect the tax every year, rather than give it to\r\n\r\nsome    specially   created   revenue   collecting\r\n\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir, that is exactly what\r\n\r\nwe  intend to do.

We  have  also\r\n\r\ncome  to  an  arrangement with  several  statutory\r\n\r\nauthorities,   including  the  Singapore   Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  whereby they will recruit  from  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  for  similar  posts.  We  have  also  had\r\n\r\nrequests for assistance in recruiting workers from\r\n\r\nfirms,  manufacturers  and others  who  want  good\r\n\r\nworkers. We have made use of Work Brigade members,\r\n\r\nsuitably qualified and trained, for recommendation\r\n\r\nto such posts.

For instance, for clerical officers,  the\r\n\r\nminimum  educational  qualification  will  be  the\r\n\r\nSenior   Cambridge  or  the  equivalent   academic\r\n\r\nstandard.

As   he  is  from   a   Socialist\r\n\r\nParty - subject  to correction - it may  be  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  always  right  in  implementing   its\r\n\r\npolicies.  But  could  the P.S.C. engage  only  a\r\n\r\nMalay? It is not our responsibility but it is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the P.S.C. But if the Government\r\n\r\ncould  so direct, I believe the opportunity  could\r\n\r\nbe  given  to the Malays because only one  man  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  The responsibilities of this  post,  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the  functions and operations  of  the\r\n\r\nDewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan, are great.\r\n\r\nIf,  however, the Assistant Head is a  non-Malay - I\r\n\r\nam  not suggesting the Government policy cannot be\r\n\r\nimplemented  - I  think  it  is  proper  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should look to the Federation. I am not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  teach the Government, but the staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Dewan Bahasa should comprise more Malays  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  the pioneers to implement the Government\r\n\r\npolicy. This is my opinion, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the functions\r\n\r\nof  the  Dewan  are well known to Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  There  are  two functions.  One  is  to\r\n\r\nfoster  the development and the popularisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  national  language, which is Malay;  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond is to undertake research in connection with\r\n\r\nthe   primary  aim  of  integrating  the   various\r\n\r\ncultures  and  of spreading a knowledge  of  those\r\n\r\ncultures. So it is inevitable that whoever is  the\r\n\r\nHead of the Dewan shoud be one who is most capable\r\n\r\nof  discharging these functions. It will therefore\r\n\r\ndepend  on who can best discharge those functions.\r\n\r\nHe  may be a Malay or anybody else, so long as  we\r\n\r\nchoose  the  right person who can discharge  these\r\n\r\ntwo  essential functions - one, to spread  knowledge\r\n\r\nof  the national language (Malay), and to help  in\r\n\r\nthe  research and development of the language; and\r\n\r\ntwo,   to   carry  out  sociological   duties   in\r\n\r\nconnection with cultural work. The staff has  been\r\n\r\nchosen  with the view that, apart from  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage, the other three languages and  the  four\r\n\r\ncultures  are involved. It is impossible  to  find\r\n\r\none  man who can carry out this work and therefore\r\n\r\nthe staff must be balanced in such a way that they\r\n\r\ncan complement one another's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I\r\n\r\nhave duly conveyed my views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. Can I be informed\r\n\r\nwhether  administrative  correspondence  in   this\r\n\r\nDewan  will be in Malay, the national language?  I\r\n\r\nask because I know that the status of the national\r\n\r\nlanguage  has  not yet been made official,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether the national  language\r\n\r\nwill  be used in the daily administration  of  the\r\n\r\nDewan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, the use of the\r\n\r\nnational language in this Dewan will depend on the\r\n\r\nextent  to which use would be made of the national\r\n\r\nlanguage  in  the whole administration.  But  here\r\n\r\nagain,  in view of the present transitional  phase\r\n\r\nof   our   development,  it  would  obviously   be\r\n\r\nimpractical to send, say, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nletter in Malay to a Chinese cultural organisation\r\n\r\nwhich might have individuals who do not understand\r\n\r\nthe   national  language.  So  the  use   of   the\r\n\r\nparticular  language  will  depend  on   to   whom\r\n\r\ncorrespondence is being sent. It is no use sending\r\n\r\na  letter  in English to somebody who  knows  only\r\n\r\nMalay, and it is no use sending a letter in  Malay\r\n\r\nto  somebody who knows only Chinese. It  is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  as we go on and as the national language  is\r\n\r\nextensively  used  throughout the  administration,\r\n\r\nthe Dewan too will make better use of the national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of\r\n\r\nInche Mohamed Ali Bin Alwi: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by  $10  in  respect  of  the  new   item\r\n\r\n(Editors).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I said it  should\r\n\r\nbe  against  this background that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  consider what action could  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  economic welfare. I ended,  before\r\n\r\nthe  interruption, with the remark that the  first\r\n\r\nthing  to  do  is  to  make sure  that  there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient  opportunities for  the  employment  of\r\n\r\nMalays   in   the  public  service  and  statutory\r\n\r\nauthorities, because such a large number  of  them\r\n\r\ndepend on these sources for a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second conclusion from my analysis is that we\r\n\r\nshould  make  every  effort to  expand  the  Malay\r\n\r\nprofessional class which today is so small.  There\r\n\r\nis  also  a  third objective which did not  emerge\r\n\r\nfrom the analysis of occupations which I had given\r\n\r\npreviously. It is this. We have large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nMalays  still  engaged  in fishing.  A  number  of\r\n\r\nfishing villages along the coasts of Singapore and\r\n\r\nin  the Southern Islands are in a depressed  state\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the dependence of so many  people  in\r\n\r\nthem  on this precarious source of livelihood.  We\r\n\r\nshall, therefore, have to take special measures in\r\n\r\nregard to this group of Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the policy of the Government in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  economic  welfare  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncitizens  of the State. To achieve the  second  of\r\n\r\nthe   objectives  which  I  have  outlined  above.\r\n\r\nNamely,  the  expansion of the Malay  professional\r\n\r\nclass,  it  is  necessary that every  Malay  child\r\n\r\nshould be given education up to the highest  level\r\n\r\npossible.  To this end, Members will already  know\r\n\r\nthat it is the policy and practice of the P.A.P. Government to give free education to  Malay\r\n\r\nchildren  in  Singapore from primary school  level\r\n\r\nright  up to the University. They do not  have  to\r\n\r\npay  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  fees either in primary  or  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  In the University of Malaya and  in  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,   special   bursaries    have    been\r\n\r\nestablished for which only Malays can compete.  At\r\n\r\npresent, we can say that a Malay student  who  has\r\n\r\nthe  qualification to enter either the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nor the University of Malaya will receive a bursary\r\n\r\nto enable him to get his higher qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards employment in Government service, the\r\n\r\nlargest  number of posts are, as everybody  knows,\r\n\r\nin  Division  IV  and  the  daily-rated  services.\r\n\r\nRecruitment  into  these  grades  is  confined  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Work Brigade. In recruitment  into\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade, and hence ultimately into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  as well as  the  services  of\r\n\r\nvarious  public authorities, they have  agreed  to\r\n\r\naccept  Government's policy in  this  respect.  In\r\n\r\nrecruitment   into   the  Work  Brigade,   special\r\n\r\nattention is paid to the recruitment of sufficient\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  Malays.  The Brigade  now  stands  at\r\n\r\n1,778.  Of this number, no less than 637, or  more\r\n\r\nthan one-third, are Malays. The ratio of Malays to\r\n\r\nnon-Malays in the Work Brigade is higher than that\r\n\r\nin   the  Government  establishments  or  in   the\r\n\r\nestablishments  of  statutory  authorities.   This\r\n\r\nmeans that opportunities open to Malays of \r\n\r\nworking-class origin for work in public authorities and in\r\n\r\nthe Government service will be maintained and even\r\n\r\nexpanded in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the strengthening of the professional\r\n\r\nor  technical classes, the relevant policy here is\r\n\r\nthat in regard to higher appointments to the Civil\r\n\r\nService, it is the policy of the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nto maximise the opportunities for the promotion of\r\n\r\nsuitable Malay officers to the highest grades  for\r\n\r\nwhich  they are fitted. Members will have read  in\r\n\r\nthis  morning's  papers that four  Malay  officers\r\n\r\nhave been promoted to the Singapore Administrative\r\n\r\nService.  In  the past two years many Malays,  who\r\n\r\nstarted their careers in the Government service as\r\n\r\nclerks,  have  been  promoted  to  the  grades  of\r\n\r\nExecutive Officers and Higher Executive Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the special problem of distressed\r\n\r\noccupations  such as fishing. My Ministry  is  not\r\n\r\ndirectly  concerned in these matters. But speaking\r\n\r\nfrom the general angle of economic development,  I\r\n\r\nwould say that the solution to the problem lies in\r\n\r\ntwo  directions.  The first  is  to  induce  these\r\n\r\npersons  to  work in better paid and  more  secure\r\n\r\noccupations. This change can be left to the normal\r\n\r\noperations of the free market. The second solution\r\n\r\nis for those who remain is this depressed industry\r\n\r\nto increase their earning power by improving their\r\n\r\nproduction   methods   and  know-how.   What   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  doing  through  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nNational Development in this matter can be briefly\r\n\r\nstated as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fishing schools are being established to teach\r\n\r\nMalay  youths who want to be fishermen the  latest\r\n\r\ntechnique  in fishing. A school has recently  been\r\n\r\nopened at Pasir Panjang, and more schools will  be\r\n\r\nestablished in other parts of the island. Next, to\r\n\r\nimprove the catch of Malay fishermen, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development intends  to  purchase  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  diesel outboard motors  which  can  be\r\n\r\nrented  to Malay fishermen at reasonable  charges.\r\n\r\nThis  scheme  has been approved by the Development\r\n\r\nPlanning Committee recently, and some five  diesel\r\n\r\noutboard engines will be purchased soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great need of villagers who are depending on\r\n\r\nfishing  for  their income is to  diversify  their\r\n\r\nsources  of incomes. For this purpose, a plan  has\r\n\r\nbeen   approved   by   the  Development   Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  introduce goats  in  Malay  fishing\r\n\r\nvillages. These goats will be purchased  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and its introduction  in  the\r\n\r\nfishing  villages  will  help  to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\neconomy of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point I have not dealt with, and that is\r\n\r\nMalay participation in trade and industry. I  have\r\n\r\nheld  discussions with the Trade Advisory  Council\r\n\r\non  how  a special effort can be made to get  more\r\n\r\nMalays  into  trade and industry. So far  we  have\r\n\r\nonly  discussed  ways and means  whereby  the  big\r\n\r\ncommercial and banking firms can engage Malays  on\r\n\r\ntheir staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  train  them for more responsible  posts.  The\r\n\r\nfirms  I  approached told me that their difficulty\r\n\r\nis  to  get sufficient numbers of qualified Malays\r\n\r\nto  take  up jobs in their businesses. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  comparatively small numbers of Malay students\r\n\r\npassing  out  with School Certificates,  the  more\r\n\r\npromising of these would have little difficulty in\r\n\r\ngetting  good and more secure jobs elsewhere.  But\r\n\r\nin  an  entrepot economy such as ours,  there  are\r\n\r\nlimits  to Government control and direction  over\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

This waiting list is related to the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  jobs that are available, so that  when\r\n\r\nthere  are  opportunities of increased employment,\r\n\r\nadditions are made to this waiting list. The whole\r\n\r\nobject  of  the  exercise is to  strike  a  proper\r\n\r\nbalance  between  the demand for  seamen  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber which is available for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to point out\r\n\r\nto  the Assembly that we have sounded the opinions\r\n\r\nof  employers of seamen in Singapore, and we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  informed  that, in addition to  the  figures\r\n\r\nthat   I   have   given  just   now,   there   are\r\n\r\napproximately 8,000 of our seamen who are  serving\r\n\r\non  ships  throughout the world and  who  are  not\r\n\r\nregistered in our Registry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

These ships  which  are\r\n\r\nregistered    in   Indonesia   employ   Indonesian\r\n\r\nnationals as well as Singapore citizens,  and  we,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  make no  distinction  between\r\n\r\nseamen  who  are  Indonesians and seamen  who  are\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore. In fact, there  are  many\r\n\r\nseamen  from  Indonesia  who  are  our  registered\r\n\r\nseamen and who have been working as seamen through\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  if we were to start discriminating\r\n\r\nin  this  way, Mr Speaker, Sir, by  making  it  a\r\n\r\ncondition that only citizens of Singapore  are  to\r\n\r\nbe  employed  as  sailors on Singapore  registered\r\n\r\nships,  then  it  would be  an  inducement  and  a\r\n\r\ntemptation  to  ships  which  are  registered   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia to dispense with our crews.

It  was also  provided  that  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance could be extended by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara from time to time as he thought fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government considers that under present\r\n\r\ncircumstances it would be more desirable  for  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to be given a more definite  period  of\r\n\r\nlife.  During  the period of one  year  since  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  this Ordinance, 564 motor  vehicles\r\n\r\nand  2,400  bicycles  in 1959, it  would  appear,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  from  the  figures  quoted,  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   as   yet  the  right  impact  on  criminals\r\n\r\ncommitting this type of offence.

It must be remembered also that  time\r\n\r\nis  required to bring about a definite  change  in\r\n\r\nthe  abnormal circumstances which necessitated the\r\n\r\nenactment  of  the Ordinance. The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of bicycle thefts has increased should  be\r\n\r\nweighed  against the fact that there  is  a  large\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of bicycles in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  that,  on the ether hand, there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nsmall drop in thefts of motor vehicles despite the\r\n\r\nfact  that the number of motor vehicles  has  also\r\n\r\nincreased in Singapore. Even if the crime  figures\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  thefts of vehicles remain  static\r\n\r\nduring  the currency of this Ordinance,  that  in\r\n\r\nitself is a good indication that the Ordinance has\r\n\r\nachieved  something good in preventing  the  theft\r\n\r\nfigures   from  rising  appreciably.   The   fact,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  this  Ordinance  would   be   in\r\n\r\noperation for another four years should act  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent   on   the  nefarious  inclinations   of\r\n\r\ncriminals towards this type of offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the purposes of continuity, this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill has been given retrospective effect\r\n\r\nfrom   the   date  of  expiry  of  the   principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance. But until this Bill becomes law, thefts\r\n\r\nof  motor  vehicles and bicycles are  being  dealt\r\n\r\nwith under the Penal Code.

If this Ordinance has now lapsed, then\r\n\r\nI  am suggesting to the Government that this is a\r\n\r\nhighly  improper way of extending the life of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the amendment to amend section 1 (2), it is\r\n\r\nsought  to  delete the word \"one\" and  substitute\r\n\r\ntherefor  the  word  \"five\",  thereby  giving   it\r\n\r\ncontinuity  with  retrospective effect.  To  begin\r\n\r\nwith,   Mr   Speaker,   Sir,   this   is   highly\r\n\r\nundesirable, particularly in a criminal  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich   affects  the  rights  and   liberties   of\r\n\r\nsubjects.  If  this amending Bill is  passed  into\r\n\r\nlaw, then the position in law is that what are not\r\n\r\noffences   today   become   offences   merely   by\r\n\r\nretrospective effect. That is a principle which no\r\n\r\nself-respecting Legislature can accede to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary says that the Government is not going to make use of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in respect of offences that  have  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  since 15th February, 1960,  until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as  this Bill, if it becomes law, is brought\r\n\r\ninto operation. With respect to the Government,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the proper way to  do  it,  as  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Ordinance has now lapsed,  would  be  to\r\n\r\nbring in an entirely new Ordinance which would not\r\n\r\nhave - on the statute book anyway - provisions  which\r\n\r\nwould  enable the Government to take retrospective\r\n\r\naction  in  respect of criminal  offences.  It  is\r\n\r\nhighly  undesirable. As there is  the  Penal  Code\r\n\r\nunder  which the offence of theft can be punished,\r\n\r\nand  as  the laws of the country provide for  the\r\n\r\ndealing  of  these  offences,  I  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that they should withdraw this Bill and\r\n\r\nreintroduce it in another form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would help the\r\n\r\nOpposition  if  the Minister for  Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\ncould  tell  us whether it is right to extend  the\r\n\r\nlife  of a law which has already lapsed.

Although the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  meant to encourage the  people  to\r\n\r\nsave,  as  far  as  the use  of  the  savings  was\r\n\r\nconcerned, we had no say in the matter.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  was so drawn up that  our  savings\r\n\r\nwould  benefit the people of Britain and  not  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 11 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nstated that the money in the savings bank could be\r\n\r\nto  a  small  extent  used to  invest  in  Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernment  securities. To be exact, we  were  not\r\n\r\nallowed to invest more than one-third of the money\r\n\r\nin   the   Post  Office  Savings  Bank  in   local\r\n\r\nsecurities. The rest of the money was to  be  kept\r\n\r\ninvested  outside  Malaya,  which  usually   meant\r\n\r\nBritain.  This meant that only a small  proportion\r\n\r\nof  the  money in the savings bank, which  is  the\r\n\r\nmoney of our people, could be used for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore. In 1947 we tried  to\r\n\r\nask  the British Government to allow us to  invest\r\n\r\nat  least half of the money in the savings bank in\r\n\r\nlocal  securities.  But  we  were  told  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government  would not  agree  to  such  a\r\n\r\nproposal. The Federation of Malaya Government also\r\n\r\ntried  at that time to do the same thing  but  was\r\n\r\nunsuccessful.  But later in 1953,  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  did succeed not merely in  using  half\r\n\r\nthe  money  but even all the money in the  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  to invest in their own securities. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  removed the condition  in  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings Bank Ordinance which  limited  the\r\n\r\namount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  money  of  the Post Office Savings  Bank  that\r\n\r\ncould be used to buy local securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we in Singapore do not have\r\n\r\nindependence,  we  do have a measure  of  internal\r\n\r\nself-government  and we must make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nsavings  and money of the people of Singapore  are\r\n\r\nused  for the benefit and well-being of the people\r\n\r\nthemselves. We cannot allow our money to  be  used\r\n\r\nfor the people of other countries when we need the\r\n\r\nmoney so badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Assembly sitting, we presented and\r\n\r\npassed  the motion about our Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan.  We  were told that as far as possible  this\r\n\r\nPlan must be financed from our own money. Thus  we\r\n\r\nneed  every  cent  that  is  saved  for  our   own\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. For these reasons, we think that\r\n\r\nit  is  about time that this section in  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings Bank Ordinance, which prevents  us\r\n\r\nfrom  using  the  money in the Bank  for  our  own\r\n\r\npurposes, should be removed and that we should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to use the money in the Savings  Bank  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  that we think is best. The  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank (Amendment) Bill seeks to remove this\r\n\r\ncondition in the original Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that this does not mean that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will now use the money in any way  such\r\n\r\nthat  people who put the money in the Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings  Bank will stand to lose it.  We  have  an\r\n\r\nhonest  Government  and this money  will  be  used\r\n\r\nhonestly  and to the best purpose. Again,  I  must\r\n\r\nemphasise   that  it  does  not  mean   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will just take the money and use it for\r\n\r\nits own purpose. If the Government needs the money\r\n\r\nfor  the Development Plan, it will borrow from the\r\n\r\nPost  Office Savings Bank by selling to  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings  Bank  bonds or  other  Government\r\n\r\nsecurities  and the Government would pay  interest\r\n\r\non  these  bonds.  Thus,  when  we  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can use the money, we  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can borrow the money and use it and not\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can take and use  it  as  it\r\n\r\nlikes.  This right to borrow freely from the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings Bank was formerly  denied  to  us.\r\n\r\nWhen this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  is passed, we will have the right to  borrow\r\n\r\nany  proportion  of the money in the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while welcoming the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary's   statement   on   the\r\n\r\neventual use of these monies invested by the small\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, and his statement that  these\r\n\r\nmonies  will not be used by the Government without\r\n\r\nproviding them with an adequate return, he has not\r\n\r\ntold  the  House  whether these monies  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  use will  be  at  the  rates  of\r\n\r\ninterest which the Government would have to pay in\r\n\r\nthe  money  market.

These\r\n\r\nregulations will naturally be made in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the Commissioner of Police and the employing\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, provision is also made in clause\r\n\r\n13  for  the  employment of  police  officers  for\r\n\r\nprivate  purposes,  such as  guarding  persons  or\r\n\r\nproperty  or  for any other reasons acceptable  to\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Police, as it  is  considered\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate that provision for the  hire  of\r\n\r\npolice  personnel should be made in the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nitself and not in Police General Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the, Bill introduces an amendment to\r\n\r\nsection  20 of the Ordinance to provide  that  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   of   Police   could   discharge   a\r\n\r\nProbationary  Inspector or  Cadet  Inspector  only\r\n\r\nwith the consent of the Minister. The discharge of\r\n\r\nsuch an Inspector is excluded from the purview  of\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  section 82 (2) of the Singapore (Constitution)\r\n\r\nOrder  in Council. This clause also introduces  an\r\n\r\namendment  which regularises the eligibility  with\r\n\r\nregard to the payment of gratuities in respect  of\r\n\r\nsubordinate officers discharged with less than  10\r\n\r\nyears' service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides by virtue of clause 4 that\r\n\r\nthere  shall  be no exception to the provision  in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance which prohibits police officers from\r\n\r\nbeing  members  of trade unions or  of  bodies  or\r\n\r\nassociations with political objects.  Formerly  it\r\n\r\nwas provided in the principal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance that where a police officer was a member\r\n\r\nof  a trade union before joining the Police Force,\r\n\r\nhe may, with the consent of the Minister, continue\r\n\r\nto be a member of that trade union during the time\r\n\r\nof  his service in the Police Force. However,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the principal Ordinance  permitting\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of associations  operated  and\r\n\r\nadministered in accordance with Police Regulations\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of enabling police  officers  to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  bring to the notice  of  Government\r\n\r\nmatters  affecting  their welfare  and  efficiency\r\n\r\nremains unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes certain amendments to section 27\r\n\r\nof   the   principal  Ordinance  with  regard   to\r\n\r\npunishment  of  subordinate police  officers  and,\r\n\r\ninter  alia,  provides  that  the  police  officer\r\n\r\nauthorised  by  a  Commanding Officer  to  conduct\r\n\r\ndisciplinary   proceedings   may   impose   on   a\r\n\r\nsubordinate  officer any of the punishments  which\r\n\r\nthe Commanding Officer may impose, except that  of\r\n\r\ndismissal or retirement from the Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill provides that a member of\r\n\r\nthe   Special  Constabulary  (or  Special   Police\r\n\r\nOfficer)  may be prosecuted in court  for  certain\r\n\r\nspecified disciplinary offences as in the case  of\r\n\r\na regular Inspector and subordinate officer of the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force. This clause arose out  of  a  court\r\n\r\ncase  in  which  it  was held that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nprovision  for  members of the  Volunteer  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  to be prosecuted in court  for  such\r\n\r\noffences, and this clause now removes any doubt in\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also makes another provision with\r\n\r\nregard  to the Special Constabulary in that clause\r\n\r\n11  provides that the Commissioner of Police shall\r\n\r\nnot,  without  the  permission  of  the  Minister,\r\n\r\naccept as a member of the Special Constabulary any\r\n\r\nperson who is not a citizen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 introduces a new form of oath or\r\n\r\naffirmation  for persons appointed to the  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  or  to any Auxiliary  Police  Force.\r\n\r\nClause  15  repeals  the provision  of  the  Ports\r\n\r\nOrdinance which relates to the Port Police  Force,\r\n\r\nas  it is now proposed by virtue of this Bill that\r\n\r\nthe  Auxiliary  Police  Force  shall  perform  the\r\n\r\nfunctions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent Port Police Force.

But  there  are  a, few\r\n\r\nthings   which   should  be   explained   by   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary. In view of the fact  that\r\n\r\nwe  are a self-governing State and in view of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  not long after this Bill is passed  it\r\n\r\nwill  be named the Polis Negara Singapura, I would\r\n\r\nlike to know whether there is a plan to change the\r\n\r\nsign  and  emblem  worn by  the  police  force  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, because I find these are the properties\r\n\r\nand  rewards which have been left by the  colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment and which should be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing, Mr Speaker, in regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Guard and Escort Unit. I imagine that perhaps\r\n\r\nin  the  future, additional expenditure  for  1961\r\n\r\nwill  be  proposed before this House in regard  to\r\n\r\nmembers of the Guard and Escort Unit. We know that\r\n\r\nit  was  debated  in December last  year  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that their salary scale was not  at  all\r\n\r\njust,  having regard to the expenditure for  1961.\r\n\r\nSo  the  matter  of  the  salary  scales  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease   in  pay  should  receive  the   serious\r\n\r\nattention of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing.

And his failure to do so,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, does not constitute in law a contempt\r\n\r\nof  the  authority of the Commission. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is therefore proposed to provide  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  refuses to give evidence on  oath  or\r\n\r\naffirmation  or  to  produce a document  or  other\r\n\r\nthing   required  to  be  produced   before   the\r\n\r\nCommission  will be guilty of contempt  under  the\r\n\r\namendment  which  we  have proposed.

There has been a new paragraph (c)  inserted\r\n\r\nwhich says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"[If any person] being required by the\r\n\r\nCommissioners  to  give  evidence   on   oath   or\r\n\r\naffirmation  or  to  produce a document  or  other\r\n\r\nthing,  refuses  to  do so,  shall  be  guilty  of\r\n\r\ncontempt.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that  once  the Commissioner has subpoenaed  a\r\n\r\nperson  to  appear before him and if  that  person\r\n\r\nrefuses to give evidence on oath or affirmation or\r\n\r\nto  produce  a  document, he shall  be  guilty  of\r\n\r\ncontempt and he may be punished under the relevant\r\n\r\nsection.  Let us examine that section in  relation\r\n\r\nto    the   Legislative   Assembly   (Powers   and\r\n\r\nPrivileges) Ordinance. The first section  I  would\r\n\r\ndraw your particular attention to, Mr Speaker, in\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly (Powers and  Privileges)\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  section  3. Section  3  relates  to\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech in this Assembly, and it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No civil or criminal proceedings may be\r\n\r\ninstituted  against any person while a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in respect of words spoken before the\r\n\r\nAssembly or a committee thereof; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in respect of words written in a report to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly or to any committee thereof or in any\r\n\r\npetition,  bill,  resolution, motion  or  question\r\n\r\nbrought or introduced by him therein.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other words, Mr Speaker, Sir, section 3 gives\r\n\r\nabsolute privilege to a Member of the Assembly  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of  statements  made  by  him  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly. I myself am doubtful what the effect  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed amendment to the Inquiry Commissions\r\n\r\nOrdinance   will  have  on  section  3   of   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  There is no doubt that this  amendment\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  later in time. Therefore,  this\r\n\r\namendment  is being made in the full knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  existence  of  section 3 of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether being later in time would have the effect\r\n\r\nof  over-riding section 3 of this 1955  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker. Sir, it is not for me to say. I think\r\n\r\nthe Minister must advise the House on that. If  it\r\n\r\ndoes  over-ride the provisions of section 3,  what\r\n\r\nthen  is  the protection which an Assemblyman  has\r\n\r\nfor  statements made by him in this Assembly?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   could   quite  easily   institute   a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry  in  respect  of   certain\r\n\r\nstatements  made by him in this Assembly,  as  has\r\n\r\nalready been done, and the Commissioner will then\r\n\r\ncall  upon  this  person to come  along  and  give\r\n\r\nevidence.  And if he fails to give evidence  under\r\n\r\nthis  proposed  new clause, the  Commissioner  can\r\n\r\nthen commit him for contempt and fine him. If that\r\n\r\nis  correct, and if those are the powers  intended\r\n\r\nthat  the  Commissioner  or  Commissioners  should\r\n\r\nhave, then section 3 loses any value that it  has.\r\n\r\nThat is the first point, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point also relates itself to other\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Legislative Assembly (Powers and\r\n\r\nPrivileges) Ordinance.

An Inquiry Commission is started  which\r\n\r\nrelates  itself  to  matters  before  that  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, and the Commissioner then exercises his\r\n\r\npowers  under  the Inquiry Commissions  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nsummons  a  Member of the Select Committee  before\r\n\r\nhim and then says, \"I want you to tell me what has\r\n\r\ntaken  place in Select Committee.\" Now that Member\r\n\r\nis  in  a  nice fix, is he not? He is between  the\r\n\r\ndevil  and the deep sea. Supposing he refuses,  is\r\n\r\nthe  position  then  this?  The  Commissioner  may\r\n\r\ncommit  him for contempt and fine him.

Is  that  the\r\n\r\nposition?  Similarly with section 24 (1)  (f)  (i)\r\n\r\nand (ii) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`publishes any report or statement purporting to\r\n\r\nbe  a  report of the proceedings of the Assembly\r\n\r\nin any case-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) where such proceedings have been conducted\r\n\r\nafter exclusion by order of the Assembly of\r\n\r\nthe public; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) where such publication has been expressly\r\n\r\nprohibited by order of the Assembly;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  anything is revealed in respect of  those  two\r\n\r\nmatters  set  out therein, that person  \"shall  be\r\n\r\nguilty  of  an  offence and  shall  be  liable  on\r\n\r\nconviction to a fine of one thousand dollars or to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for twelve months or  to  both  such\r\n\r\nfine  and imprisonment.\" Here again, he is between\r\n\r\ntwo  fires - between the fire of the Speaker and the\r\n\r\nfire of the Commissioner. So the position seems  a\r\n\r\nbit  ticklish for some gentleman who should be  so\r\n\r\nfoolhardy  as to contest an election, get  himself\r\n\r\nelected,  and say something in the Assembly  which\r\n\r\nincurs   the   disapproval  of   the   Government;\r\n\r\nwhereupon  the Government institutes a  Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  and the Commissioner  under  his  new\r\n\r\npowers  seeks to get at the truth of  things.

Money which is held  by  the\r\n\r\nPublic Trustee on trust for a long period of  time\r\n\r\nis  invested  in  the Common  Fund,  so  that  the\r\n\r\ninterest can be credited to the individual estates\r\n\r\nup  to the time of distribution. Other monies such\r\n\r\nas  funds held by an estate which are to  be  paid\r\n\r\nout  within  a few months, or small amounts  which\r\n\r\nare  held  for  minors and are  being  reduced  by\r\n\r\nmonthly payments of maintenance, are held  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic Trustee General Estates Bank Account. Under\r\n\r\nthe  existing  law,  such monies  are  held  in  a\r\n\r\ngeneral banking account and earn interest  at  the\r\n\r\nrate of two per cent on the daily balance which is\r\n\r\npaid   into   the  Consolidated  Fund  under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 6 (7) of the Public  Trustee\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The proposed amendment will enable such\r\n\r\nmonies  to  be  placed on fixed  deposit,  thereby\r\n\r\nearning  interest  at about  four  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\namount in the General Estates Bank Account is  now\r\n\r\nabout half a million dollars and represents monies\r\n\r\ndue  to  about 300 estates varying in  value  from\r\n\r\n$100   to  $20,000.  It  is  difficult,  from   an\r\n\r\naccounting  point  of view, to  pay  out  interest\r\n\r\nearned   on   small   estates   to   the   various\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries, as this will involve  a  tremendous\r\n\r\namount of work; and as the average amount held  in\r\n\r\nsuch  estates  is small, the interest  earned  for\r\n\r\neach  estate  will be negligible. It is  therefore\r\n\r\nproposed,  as  in  the past, to pay  out  interest\r\n\r\nearned into the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed is to section 14 of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Trustee Ordinance.

In order to give\r\n\r\nsuch  directions,  it will be  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to have the audited accounts of the  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee  for  the preceding year, but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nalways  possible for such accounts to be ready  by\r\n\r\nFebruary  in  the  year.

But  the  Select  Committee  spent   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount of time  on  it.  There  were\r\n\r\naltogether  12 sittings. The Committee unanimously\r\n\r\nagreed to this revised Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we made certain important amendments in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill as a whole. One is the changing  of  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the  Bill.  During the  session  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee,   many  witnesses  came  forward.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of them were of the opinion that,  since\r\n\r\nthe Bill was to help in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunification  of the Sikh temples in Singapore,  it\r\n\r\nwas the proper time to change the name of the Bill\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Queen  Street  and  Silat  Road   Sikh\r\n\r\nGurdawaras Bill to that of the present title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major change in the Bill concerns the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  the Board of  Trustees.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, the two main Sikh temples were dominated  by\r\n\r\nthree  societies  of Sikhs. In other  words,  they\r\n\r\nmonopolised  Sikh  affairs  in  Singapore.  During\r\n\r\nCommittee sessions, various Sikh organisations and\r\n\r\nindividuals came forward and put forward the  view\r\n\r\nthat it was high time that this monopoly should be\r\n\r\nstopped  and  proper representation in  the  Board\r\n\r\nshould  be  given.  After  hearing  evidence,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee    unanimously    decided    to     give\r\n\r\nrepresentation  not  only to the  three  societies\r\n\r\nalready   mentioned,  but  also   to   two   other\r\n\r\norganisations  (two  representatives   from   each\r\n\r\norganisation),  and 15 elective members  from  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Sikh  Temple.

Because of the things that had happened\r\n\r\npreviously, the management of their Committees was\r\n\r\nleft  in  the  hands  of  associations,  and   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  which necessitated  that  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  no  longer  exist today.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  has sought to  keep  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  requirements of a  modern  age  and,\r\n\r\nshall we say, the management of a past era, and we\r\n\r\nhave  tried  to  bring  the two  together  in  the\r\n\r\nearnest  hope  that  they  too  will  join   hands\r\n\r\ntogether  and  work  this  Bill  for  the  general\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Sikh community at large.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Committee appreciates that it does not have  a\r\n\r\nhundred  per  cent support of all the  people  who\r\n\r\ncame  before  the Committee, but  I  think  I  can\r\n\r\nsafely  say  that at least 90 to 95  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  came  before  the  Committee  entirely\r\n\r\napproved of clause 3 as it now stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I appeal to certain\r\n\r\nolder  members of the Sikh community to work  this\r\n\r\nBill in the spirit which the Select Committee hope\r\n\r\nthey  will work it? We feel sure that if there  is\r\n\r\nthis harmony between these five societies and  the\r\n\r\nelected representatives of the Gurdwaras, it  will\r\n\r\nbe in the best interests of that community. And  I\r\n\r\nthink it is fair to express at this stage that the\r\n\r\nCommittee felt that the time should soon come when\r\n\r\nthe  entire  management of  the  Sikh  temples  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be left to the congregations  of\r\n\r\nthe Gurdwaras rather than to any associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to associate\r\n\r\nmyself  with the Member for Telok Blangah in  what\r\n\r\nhe  said with regard to the Chairman of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. Sir, a lot of evidence was taken and  a\r\n\r\nlot   of  marshalling  and  channelling  of   that\r\n\r\nevidence  in  a proper direction was  needed.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  are very grateful to you,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   for   having  done  that  and  for   having\r\n\r\npinpionted  the  more important bits  of  evidence\r\n\r\nthat came out before the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Mammen, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mammen</b> indicated dissent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would be completely out of order\r\n\r\nif the Speaker takes part in this debate now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\nWednesday, 24th May, 1961.\" -[Mr Rajaratnam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">6.12 p.m. to Wednesday, 24th May, 1961.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
