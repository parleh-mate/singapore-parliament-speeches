Sir,  the policy speech  delivered  by  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in this  House\r\n\r\nhas  enumerated  the new policies and programmes  for\r\n\r\nour   nation-building.  All  these   programmes   and\r\n\r\npolicies represent a challenge. They outline our aims\r\n\r\nand  tasks for nation-building, that is, to  build  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial, democratic socialist society  which  is\r\n\r\nfair and just. The task of nation-building is not  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  alone. It is also the  task  of  all\r\n\r\npatriotic citizens. All people should be mobilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the present Session is a new page in\r\n\r\nthe history of Singapore. It has ushered in a new era\r\n\r\nin  the  history  of Singapore as an independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign country. It has ushered in an era in  which\r\n\r\nwe should all contribute our best towards building  a\r\n\r\nprosperous  and happy nation. What is regrettable  is\r\n\r\nthat  when  such  an  era is being  ushered  in,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  Members  are  not   sharing   our\r\n\r\nsentiments and the sentiments of the people when they\r\n\r\nresort to boycotting this Session or Parliament. This\r\n\r\nis  understandable  from their philosophy - subversion\r\n\r\nagainst  our nation. We condemn the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\naction  in boycotting the Parliament and in resorting\r\n\r\nto  anti-national activities. As Assemblymen  elected\r\n\r\nby  the people, their basic duty is to speak for  the\r\n\r\npeople  and to voice the intentions and the  will  of\r\n\r\nthe  people in this House. Yet they have gone out  of\r\n\r\ntheir way to say that our independence is phoney  and\r\n\r\nthat  our sovereignty is only superficial. More  than\r\n\r\n100  nations throughout the world have recognised  in\r\n\r\nas  an  independent  and sovereign country,  although\r\n\r\nours  is  a small country. This can be seen from  the\r\n\r\nkeen welcome extended to our Goodwill Mission to \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries led by our Deputy Prime Minister, Dr\r\n\r\nToh  Chin Chye. The talk by the Barisan Sosialis that\r\n\r\nSingapore's independence is false should be condemned\r\n\r\nby all the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what has made the case of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis so sad is the Fact that the  people\r\n\r\nhave  not  paid  any attention to their  shouting  of\r\n\r\nslogans. Their boycott has caused no surprise because\r\n\r\nall  the  people  have  come to  realise  that  their\r\n\r\nperformance   and  the  shouting  of   slogans   that\r\n\r\nSingapore is a neo-colonialist country created by  an\r\n\r\nimperialist  plot  have  been  seen  through  by  the\r\n\r\npeople. Now the people are discerning. In the end, in\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  history, such a hunch  of  political\r\n\r\nadventurers   will  be  buried  by  the  overwhelming\r\n\r\nstrength of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task ahead of us is to build a multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual, multi-cultural,    multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety - fair and just - in which everybody can get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na fair share of the facilities and benefits offered\r\n\r\nby the country and where nobody will he discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  by  others.  This has  all  along  been  our\r\n\r\nobjective, in fact, since 1959 when our Party came to\r\n\r\npower. This policy has been implemented ever since we\r\n\r\nhave been in power. It is the one best fitted to  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   character   of   our   society.    The\r\n\r\nintelligent  leadership and policy of the  Government\r\n\r\nhave  rallied the people closer together.  They  have\r\n\r\nset  an  objective for all the people to strive  for.\r\n\r\nAll  patriotic citizens should seize this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  do  their  best  in this work of nation-building.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the only correct one that can lead our\r\n\r\ncountry towards a happy and prosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Chinese are the majority in Singapore,\r\n\r\nour  policy is based on multi-racialism. This is  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  our  policy in nation  building.  We  have\r\n\r\nrecognised Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English  as  the\r\n\r\nfour  official  languages, with Malay as  the  common\r\n\r\nnational  language. In fact, this humane and  correct\r\n\r\npolicy  will  not  only  bring about  prosperity  and\r\n\r\nstability to our nation, but it is also one that  has\r\n\r\nthe  popular support of the people. From this we  can\r\n\r\nsee that the policy of nation-building based on \r\n\r\nmulti-racialism is one that is acceptable to all. It is the\r\n\r\nonly  correct  one. It is also a humanitarian  policy\r\n\r\nwhich can lead to the happiness and prosperity of our\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  Switzerland, where the same  policy  is\r\n\r\npursued, we also see peace and happiness. The  events\r\n\r\nin  Rhodesia  and  South Africa  and  in  some  other\r\n\r\ncountries, on the contrary, are not very enviable for\r\n\r\nus  to  emulate.  There  is discrimination  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries. They are in a state of turmoil and we  can\r\n\r\nsee sanguinary fratricidal activities going on there.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  remind  the racial extremists  of  such\r\n\r\nracial  inequality  and the tragedy  that  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace  there. They should reconsider their  attitude.\r\n\r\nThey  should  open their eyes wide and  see  what  is\r\n\r\ntaking  place  in South Africa, Rhodesia  and  Cyprus\r\n\r\nwhere  there are racial disturbances. These conflicts\r\n\r\nare a great tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I shall now touch on the Five-Year Plan as contained in the policy speech of the Yang di- Pertuan Negara. The task ahead is for a peaceful reformation of our society. After seven years of continuous improvements in building and construction, we have achieved certain objectives. These\r\n\r\nachievements  have  won  the  general   applause   of\r\n\r\ninternational   circles.  They  have  acclaimed   our\r\n\r\nachievements. Even our Minister for Finance, Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nKim San, was acknowledged for his meritorious service\r\n\r\nin   nation-building  by  being  presented  with  the\r\n\r\nMagsaysay Award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy is good for our society. Under this\r\n\r\npolicy a high living standard for our people has been\r\n\r\nbrought about. From 1961-64 we implemented the  first\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Plan.  We  spent  about  $870  million  in\r\n\r\neconomic     development, housing,     industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment, public administration, social  services,\r\n\r\nand  other services which have given a great  impetus\r\n\r\nto  the  progress of Singapore. From 1961 there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  annual increases in revenue and expenditure  on\r\n\r\ndevelopment is also increasing. In 1961 the  sum  was\r\n\r\n$230  million, and in 1964 it was $280 million. There\r\n\r\nwas an increase of 7 per cent. Additional sums are to\r\n\r\nhe  allotted for the additional one year to the First\r\n\r\nPlan.  Large  sums have again been allotted  for  the\r\n\r\nnext  Five-Year  Plan which will he used  for  social\r\n\r\nreforms,    housing,    urban    redevelopment    and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    which    will    create     more\r\n\r\nopportunities of employment, and which will  lead  to\r\n\r\nthe modernisation of our City State. Undoubtedly this\r\n\r\nFive-Year   Development  Plan  can  be  expected   to\r\n\r\nsucceed.  This  will further raise  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  our  people who are  already  enjoying  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable standard of living, just as what was said\r\n\r\nin the policy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British bases now in Singapore are only a temporary\r\n\r\nmeasure   for   our  own  defence.   Therefore,   our\r\n\r\nGovernment is contemplating the implementation  of  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  force in order to defend our  country.  No\r\n\r\nmatter  how  the Barisan Sosialis and  their  stooges\r\n\r\nboycott  us,  the  people will pay no  heed  to  such\r\n\r\nfoolish antics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures strongly reflect the fact that our\r\n\r\nnation  is  recognised as one having a good standing.\r\n\r\nThe  people understand very well that it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  everybody to contribute his bit to the  continued\r\n\r\nprogress  of his country. For that purpose,  all  the\r\n\r\npeople  should volunteer to join the People's  Forces\r\n\r\nin  order  to  defend our country,  so  that  we  may\r\n\r\nsurvive.  There is a Chinese saying that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nduty  of every citizen to see that his nation exists,\r\n\r\nand   this  kind  of  patriotic  act  is  the  surest\r\n\r\nguarantee of our continued survival and the existence\r\n\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this newly independent country of\r\n\r\nours has given all the people new tasks to perform in\r\n\r\norder  to  build a model country in which  all  races\r\n\r\nwill  have equal status. The minority races will have\r\n\r\nspecial safeguards in the Constitution. Everybody can\r\n\r\nplay  his  part in nation-building. Every able-bodied\r\n\r\nperson and youth should brace himself for the task of\r\n\r\nnation-building  and  render  his  services  to   the\r\n\r\ncountry to the best of his ability, whether it is  in\r\n\r\nthe   fields  of  commerce,  education,  agriculture,\r\n\r\ndefence,  or  in  any other field of human  activity.\r\n\r\nEveryone can contribute his hit to enable the country\r\n\r\nto  march  forward to become a modernised and  highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised  country which  will  bring  about  an\r\n\r\naffluent  society for all the two million  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore --- a new model society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara for his speech, and I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  the First Parliament  of  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore, and I join my friends in thanking the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara for his Address delivered  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. In his Address, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has\r\n\r\nsaid  that equal treatment will he given to all races\r\n\r\nand  all language streams, and also that a Commission\r\n\r\nwill  be  appointed to look into the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\nminority  races and to find .out their  problems.  No\r\n\r\ncountry  in  the  world has only  one  race  for  its\r\n\r\npopulation. At one time or other different races have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlived  in these countries and different cultures  put\r\n\r\ninto  practice. Finally, as the days go by, all these\r\n\r\ndifferent cultures are integrated and become one. For\r\n\r\nexample, take Russia or the United States of America.\r\n\r\nIn  these  countries there are people who speak  many\r\n\r\nlanguages and who belong to many races. Countries  in\r\n\r\nAsia,  Africa and Europe are no exception either.  We\r\n\r\ncan even take our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThey  have people of different races and of different\r\n\r\ncultures.  It is also the case with Singapore,  which\r\n\r\nnow  has  attained full independence. It  has  got  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial population. We, the Government, can  put\r\n\r\ninto practice proper programmes and adopt a policy of\r\n\r\nmutual   understanding  and   tolerance.   By   these\r\n\r\npolicies,  we  can  have  a nation  of  peaceful \r\n\r\nco-existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small island and our people have to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  trade.  We  have to  admit  that  we  are\r\n\r\nenjoying  a high standard of living and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, our population is increasing. So the Government\r\n\r\nhas a duty to increase the facilities for the people.\r\n\r\nIn  education, housing, and in the industrial  field,\r\n\r\nwe have achieved progress through our first Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan.  At  the  same  time when  we  talk  about  our\r\n\r\nprogress, we have also to look into the defects.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has to find out the defects and  work  out\r\n\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Tamil secondary school in Singapore. It\r\n\r\nis  the only Tamil secondary school and is called the\r\n\r\nUmar Pulavar Secondary School. The children who leave\r\n\r\nit after completing their studies are not able to get\r\n\r\nequal    opportunities   for   jobs   in   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  If  the reason for this  is  the  lower\r\n\r\nstandard  of education in this school, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  find  out  the  defects  and,  if  necessary,\r\n\r\nintroduce a new syllabus, thereby giving such \r\n\r\nschool-leavers  equal  preference with  children  who  leave\r\n\r\nschools in other streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our housing programme is praiseworthy. But the\r\n\r\nHousing Board is adopting certain policies which  are\r\n\r\nnot  practicable. For example, take a family  of  two\r\n\r\nboys,  two  girls, and a mother. They take a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the  name of one of the boys and live  for  15\r\n\r\nyears.  As the days go by, the two boys are  married,\r\n\r\nand  one  of  them is quick enough  to  buy  a  house\r\n\r\nthrough a loan from the Government. Since the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flat  was acquired through him,  he  writes  a\r\n\r\nletter to the Board saying that he has bought a house\r\n\r\nand requesting the Board to change the tenancy to his\r\n\r\nbrother  who  is going to live there. But  the  Board\r\n\r\nsays,  \"According to our rules, if a  tenant  buys  a\r\n\r\nhouse  of  his own, he has to vacate the  fiat  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  with  his family.\" \"This is impossible,\"  says\r\n\r\nthe  tenant. \"I can move into my own house only  with\r\n\r\nmy  wife and children. I can't take the whole  family\r\n\r\nin,  my  brother and my mother.\" But the Board argues\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  change the tenancy  only  under  two\r\n\r\nconditions  - one is should the tenant die,  and  the\r\n\r\nother should the tenant leave the country. Other than\r\n\r\nthese  two  conditions,  they  will  not  change  the\r\n\r\ntenancy to any other person. So we have certain rules\r\n\r\nwhich are not practicable, and I request the Board to\r\n\r\nchange  them, so that they could he put into practice\r\n\r\nand  help  to  raise the standard of  living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to touch on foreign policy. We are\r\n\r\nadopting a non-aligned policy in our foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThis  was  stated by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  For\r\n\r\nexample,   we  are  friendly  with  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries and we show our goodwill to them.  This  is\r\n\r\nour desire. This is important for the progress of our\r\n\r\npeople  and  country as a whole. Now  we  are  in  an\r\n\r\natomic  age, and we can only survive if  we  adopt  a\r\n\r\nneutral  policy. Afro-Asian countries and  India  are\r\n\r\nadopting such a policy. Our Government has adopted it\r\n\r\nin  world  politics. It will be independent  in  such\r\n\r\npolicies.  If  we put into practice our policies,  we\r\n\r\nshow  no partiality towards West or East. We are  not\r\n\r\nbound  by  any  of these countries.  In  our  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  as  regards  Vietnam and  the  Indo-Pakistani\r\n\r\nconflict, we are neutral and we closely go  with  the\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries. By adopting this policy, we can\r\n\r\ncreate more opportunities for the trade of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry.  Most  of  our people depend  on  trade  and\r\n\r\nindustries for their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Jurong industrial complex, there are many\r\n\r\nfactories   coming  up  and  more  goods  are   being\r\n\r\nproduced.  We have to search for outside markets  for\r\n\r\nthese products. There is no Common Market going to be\r\n\r\nestablished  with  Malaysia,  so  we  have  to   find\r\n\r\nexternal markets for the good of our people. We  have\r\n\r\nto  live, so the only way is to have a neutral policy\r\n\r\nwith  all the countries and establish trade relations\r\n\r\nwith countries like America, Russia and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister and the State Minister for Education went on\r\n\r\na  tour.  A  good reception was given to  them.  This\r\n\r\nreflects the correctness of our policy. Next year  we\r\n\r\nare   going  to  send  trade  missions  to  different\r\n\r\ncountries. This shows our victory in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan are boycotting this Parliament now. They\r\n\r\nsay  we should be friendly with Afro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we are friendly with Afro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\nNot  only  that, but we go even beyond that.  We  are\r\n\r\nadopting the neutral policy of these countries and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell these people this, in fact, it  is\r\n\r\nthe Barisan who adopt a particular group policy. They\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  should  he  friendly  with  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries but they do not have the foresight  of  the\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been accepted as an independent\r\n\r\ncountry  by  the United Nations. When our  delegation\r\n\r\nwent  to  the  Afro-Asian countries  to  explain  our\r\n\r\nindependence,  they  respected  the  independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  gave  a  red carpet  welcome  to  the\r\n\r\ndelegation.  But the Barisan here are boycotting  the\r\n\r\nSession  of  this Parliament. This shows how  defunct\r\n\r\nthey  are in their policies. They do not know how  to\r\n\r\nrespect their own country's independence. They do not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the independence of their own country.  I\r\n\r\nsay  to  them that they should learn from  the \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  countries to respect Singapore's independence.\r\n\r\nWe  are  trying  to he friendly with  Indonesia,  our\r\n\r\nbiggest neighbour. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sell  to Indonesia,  which  needs  them\r\n\r\nurgently,  food and medicine. Recently the Indonesian\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister, Dr Subandrio, has  expressed  his\r\n\r\ndesire to have talks with Singapore. In future, there\r\n\r\nis an opportunity for better relationship between the\r\n\r\npeoples  of  both the territories. One day  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand Peking will realise the status of our independent\r\n\r\ncountry.  When that time conies, I do not know  where\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan will go and hide themselves. Our foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  will  always take into account not  only  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  our people hut also the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nindeed  very grateful for the opportunity to he  here\r\n\r\ntoday  to  express our thanks to His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara for his Address at the opening\r\n\r\nof the present Session of this House. Grateful indeed\r\n\r\nwe  ought to be for our very presence here,  for  the\r\n\r\npolitical developments in the last two years ---  two\r\n\r\nvery  eventful  years --- took such a rapid  and  rigid\r\n\r\ncourse   that   even  the  then  Central   Government\r\n\r\ncontemplated  repressive measures which  were  openly\r\n\r\nadmitted  without  reserve by the Prime  Minister  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Prince Abdul Rahman, on the day we  became\r\n\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether we can regard ourselves\r\n\r\nas unfortunate, for we happened to assume the role of\r\n\r\nspeaking  the minds of the people and, therefore,  we\r\n\r\nwere supposed to be the ones that were repressed. But\r\n\r\none  thing we are fortunate in - and I think the people\r\n\r\nacross  the Causeway should also share in it  ---  is\r\n\r\nthat   these  repressive  measures  never  became   a\r\n\r\nreality. Because if they did, then it would throw the\r\n\r\nwhole  country  into  chaos and  confusion,  and  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of this House and the Members  here  would\r\n\r\nhave become a mockery of democracy, a term which  has\r\n\r\na  different  connotation in the minds  of  both  the\r\n\r\nfeudal reactionaries ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the House\r\n\r\nthat that is a line which the Chair will not accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The term \"democracy\" has a\r\n\r\ndifferent   connotation   in   the   minds   of   the\r\n\r\ncommunalists and the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intensity of the political struggle\r\n\r\nbetween the P.A.P. and the ultra-communalists in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years was not only a bitter battle  to  win\r\n\r\nand  capture the hearts and minds of the  people  for\r\n\r\nour  survival alone, but was also a conflict  of  the\r\n\r\nbasic political philosophy between the Right-wing and\r\n\r\nthe progressive democratic Socialists, in our way, we\r\n\r\nbelieve that we can succeed and we have succeeded  to\r\n\r\na very large extent in proving to the people that our\r\n\r\nmethod  is the best alternative in achieving a better\r\n\r\ndeal in life for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in whatever direction the political\r\n\r\ndevelopment in our country may take, we, the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nare  always alive to the challenges that confront  us\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time;  and for these  challenges,  we\r\n\r\nsought  for  and  obtained  new  approaches  and  new\r\n\r\nsolutions. In this gruelling struggle, we have  never\r\n\r\nlost  sight of our objectives and obligations to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, i.e., to build, in the course of\r\n\r\nfive,  ten  or even 20 years, a multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nfounded  upon the principles of democratic socialism.\r\n\r\nWe  are caught, as in every developing country in the\r\n\r\nworld,  in  a  dilemma;  that is,  in  our  political\r\n\r\napproaches, the Government must be ideological and as\r\n\r\npragmatic  in  its  administration.  There  are  some\r\n\r\npolitical   Parties  which  cannot  adopt   a   fixed\r\n\r\npolitical  ideology  for  their  party  lines.   Some\r\n\r\npolitical Parties are openly anti-Communist  and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, resist the idea of socialism, for  it\r\n\r\nwas  branded as a foreign ideology. And at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  they  refuse to be called capitalists.  So  if\r\n\r\nthey are anti-Communists, reject socialism and refuse\r\n\r\nto be called capitalists, what are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the struggle was in fact the result of rising\r\n\r\nfear  of  the  traditionalists. It was  the  fear  of\r\n\r\nprogress, the fear of new ideas, the fear of a better\r\n\r\ndeal for the people, the fear of a better alternative\r\n\r\nwhich  inevitably must result in higher  demands  and\r\n\r\nexpectations  from the people. For us, these  demands\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpectations are to be welcomed, because  we  believe\r\n\r\nit  is  only  with  the political sophistication  and\r\n\r\nmaturity of the people that a nation can survive  and\r\n\r\nprogress.  We  can  afford  to  make  this  statement\r\n\r\nbecause,  with our determination, our dedication  and\r\n\r\nour  dynamism  which is so apparently absent  in  the\r\n\r\nleadership  in  the  neighbouring countries,  we  can\r\n\r\nmeet, to a fairly adequate extent, the immediate  and\r\n\r\nthe long-term requirements of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the traditionalists, our\r\n\r\nprogress  and  achievements  must  be  resisted   and\r\n\r\nhalted.  But  they were not the only  ones  who  were\r\n\r\nenvious  and  frightened  of  our  success.  For  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nour  success would mean that the democratic socialist\r\n\r\nway  in  nation-building  was  far  better  than  the\r\n\r\nCommunist-Marxist  idea of armed  revolution  -  that\r\n\r\ndestruction   must  necessarily  be  a   prelude   to\r\n\r\nconstruction. En all these struggles, the  Communists\r\n\r\nand   the   front-line  expendables  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  found  themselves in a  state  of  complete\r\n\r\nindecisiveness and, therefore, inspiration would have\r\n\r\nto  be  sought from somewhere outside Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nthis inspiration was not forthcoming and neither  was\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement satisfactory because, at this  very\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  two reluctant Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Member for Nee Soon and the Member  for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh are now being chased from pillar to post by\r\n\r\nthe anti-Communist army quite near to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our struggle in the last two years can be\r\n\r\ngeneralised  into two fronts. On the  one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nideological  front and, on the other,  the  pragmatic\r\n\r\nfront. The temporary impotency of the Communists  and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis gave us good time  and  a  good\r\n\r\nopportunity to concentrate our efforts in  our  fight\r\n\r\nwith  the  communalists and the traditionalists.  For\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in Singapore, politically our  base  has\r\n\r\nbeen  secured. And to the Communalists, there is only\r\n\r\none  avenue  open to them. They know that politically\r\n\r\nthey  can  never control Singapore. Our  people  with\r\n\r\nprogressive  ideas, our people with  higher  demands,\r\n\r\nrequire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  administration  that will bring  better  results.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  political  arena  of  Singapore  was\r\n\r\ntotally  hostile  to them. And, therefore,  the  only\r\n\r\navenue   left   to  them  was  by  way  of   economic\r\n\r\nstrangulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to touch on the pros and cons of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. I personally feel that the concept and  the\r\n\r\nbasic  principles  which brought about  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nstill  valid  at this very moment. However,  when  we\r\n\r\nwere  a  member in Malaysia, as I said  earlier,  our\r\n\r\nprogress was not to be tolerated. And in this action,\r\n\r\nthey  paid a high price  - turnover tax, crown cork\r\n\r\ntax,  profit tax and a whole host of others - at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of even the sufferings of their own people - our  people. Sir, in sentiment, I cannot  regard  the\r\n\r\npeople across the Causeway as a separate people.  And\r\n\r\nthey  introduced  all these taxes even  knowing  full\r\n\r\nwell that their own people would suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

For\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis,  new instructions  could  not\r\n\r\nreach  them in time and they are now facing a \r\n\r\nthree-level  split,  a  split in the higher leadership,  as\r\n\r\nacknowledged by Mr Lim Ching Siong that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence is genuine and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they must accept the situation and channel  and\r\n\r\nredirect their struggle within an independent nation.\r\n\r\nAnother  split  is among the front-line  expendables,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the present Barisan Sosialis leadership - third-class  heroes  they are  -  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence is phoney, and for that matter they must\r\n\r\nboycott  Parliament sittings and even elections.  But\r\n\r\nsome  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  may  be  more\r\n\r\npractical,  for  even at this moment  when  they  are\r\n\r\nboycotting Parliament, the usual allowance will still\r\n\r\ngo  to  them and they will accept them with open  and\r\n\r\nwilling hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are now caught in a dilemma, as was the\r\n\r\ncase with the M.C.P. in the year 1957, whether or not\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge  the  Pan-Malayan Independence,  with\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence - and  the  Right-wing  also\r\n\r\nfound  themselves in difficulties, some  of  them  in\r\n\r\nrespect of their livelihood. For example - I  would\r\n\r\nask  your  guidance, Mr Speaker, if I am allowed  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to a former Chief Minister of this House  -  a\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister from 1955 to 1959 who said that\r\n\r\nhe  was  the only saviour for the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nand that Singapore was his only country. So many good\r\n\r\nwords had been uttered, so many good things had  been\r\n\r\nsaid,  but  two or three days after independence,  he\r\n\r\nfound  himself forsaking the people of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwillingly   accepting  the  citizenship  of   another\r\n\r\ncountry.  Does  it  mean that  within  two  days,  he\r\n\r\nsuddenly  lost his love for the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nafter  so many good things had been said? He  is  now\r\n\r\nenjoying a good position as a High Commissioner for a\r\n\r\nforeign  country. Sir, \"loyalty\" is a  very  abstract\r\n\r\nterm. As I have said, to the Communists, to the \r\n\r\nRight-wing  and to us, it might mean different things,  but\r\n\r\ndefinitely it does not mean that if one's  rice  bowl\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  broken  tomorrow  or  next  week,   lie\r\n\r\ntherefore would forsake his citizenship and  loyalty,\r\n\r\nwould  assume  citizenship of  another  country,  and\r\n\r\nwould pledge his allegiance to another country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an open society. We prefer and we believe\r\n\r\nin  open  argument, a frank expression of  ideas  and\r\n\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House itself is a public forum for the elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people to come and  voice  the\r\n\r\ngrievances of the people they represent. In  the  ten\r\n\r\nyears from 1955 to 1965 - and from 1959, the first time\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. came to power up to the present time -  we\r\n\r\nhave  fought  the  colonialists, the Communists,  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  opportunists, the  communalists  and  the\r\n\r\nfeudalists and even a combination of some of them, as\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen in the Hong Lim by-election. Sir,  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election could have probably changed  the\r\n\r\nentire course of history of Singapore. Had the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nlost the Hong Lim by-election, then I would say, as I\r\n\r\nhave  said  earlier,  that  it  might  have  led   to\r\n\r\nrepressive  measures, and therefore the existence  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  would no longer be regarded  as  useful.\r\n\r\nHowever,  each phase and each struggle  gave  us  new\r\n\r\nstrength,  dedication and renewed conviction  in  our\r\n\r\nbeliefs,  and  I do not believe that  any  amount  of\r\n\r\nsuppression, threats, such as one voice, one race and\r\n\r\none   religion,  meaningless  demonstrations  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and bomb explosions  or  even  race\r\n\r\nriots - we experienced two race riots in 1964 -  can\r\n\r\ndeter us from our set course to nationhood. We do not\r\n\r\nsubmit to any intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with independence, we are now faced with a\r\n\r\nheavier  burden, but we can bear it. In three  years'\r\n\r\ntime, Singapore will prosper. In the short period  of\r\n\r\nthree to five years, we will set the right foundation\r\n\r\nfor  our new nation. We do not ask for anything  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  right of our people to determine  our  own\r\n\r\ndestiny  and to live our own way of life,  unmolested\r\n\r\nand  unhindered  by anybody in this  region.  We  are\r\n\r\nsmall in every respect, in terms of population, area,\r\n\r\nnatural resources and, therefore, we have no capacity\r\n\r\nto  attack others, and it is not our intention to  do\r\n\r\nso,  but we must have the capacity to prevent  others\r\n\r\nfrom  attacking us. On the other hand, we cannot bear\r\n\r\nthe  tremendous expense of raising and maintaining  a\r\n\r\nfull-scale army and, therefore, we have the  idea  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  up a big people's force, a volunteer  army.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Prime Minister has said, the world does  not\r\n\r\nowe us a living, and we also do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowe  the  world a living. We want to be friends  with\r\n\r\nall.  The  friends  of another  country  may  be  our\r\n\r\nfriends too, but the enemy of another country may not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be regarded as our enemy. To  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  a  special and vested interest in the political\r\n\r\nstability of this region, I say that they really have\r\n\r\nsomething to ponder on. But it would be naive for  us\r\n\r\nto  believe  that we can survive on our  own  without\r\n\r\nsubjecting ourselves to the influence and development\r\n\r\nof neighbouring countries, it is in our interest that\r\n\r\nwe  wish to see Malaysia succeed and prosper, because\r\n\r\nwe believe that if a volcano erupts 250 miles away in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, the lava will come down to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  that  does  not mean that we will  beg  for  our\r\n\r\nsurvival on bended knees. And to those who think they\r\n\r\ncan  sink us by hostile acts, we say, \"Think  again,\"\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore will not be the only one to  sink.\r\n\r\nIn  this  sinking  ship, you carry along  the  entire\r\n\r\nfeudal  system,  the  entire old  social  order.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever happens, Singapore is bound to be a catalyst\r\n\r\nthat  will  start  a chain reaction  throughout  this\r\n\r\nregion,  whether for prosperity or for chaos.  If  we\r\n\r\nsucceed, so will this region. If we fail, then I  say\r\n\r\nthat  those who have special interests in this region\r\n\r\nwill   have   to  sit  down  and  recalculate   their\r\n\r\nobligations in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our foreign policy, we have adopted a non-aligned stand and I am given to understand that there\r\n\r\nis  a  motion in the House in the name of  a  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Member to urge the Government to be friendly\r\n\r\nwith  Afro-Asian  countries. Sir,  we  are  not  only\r\n\r\nfriendly  with  Afro-Asian  countries,  but  we   are\r\n\r\naccepted  as  a  member of the Afro-Asian  camp.  Our\r\n\r\nGoodwill Mission first to the United Nations and then\r\n\r\nto  the Afro-Asian and Eastern European countries  is\r\n\r\nsufficient  proof  to the Barisan Sosialis  that  the\r\n\r\nindependence   of   Singapore   is   not   a   phoney\r\n\r\nindependence  and a neo-colonialist  and  imperialist\r\n\r\nplot.  Even Russia, who, according to some pro-Peking\r\n\r\nelements  in  the Barisan Sosialis, are  revisionists\r\n\r\nbut by no means neo-colonialists, accepted Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhat else do they want?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with growing recognition from countries in the\r\n\r\nworld, our international position is strengthened and\r\n\r\nconsolidated.  While we find more  and  more  friends\r\n\r\ncoming to our aid, we still find opposition among the\r\n\r\nBarisan  who  say  that Singapore's  independence  is\r\n\r\nphoney and a neo-colonialist plot. But we have passed\r\n\r\nthrough difficult periods since independence. On  9th\r\n\r\nAugust  there  were  some high hopes  in  the  former\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government  - before  9th  August  were\r\n\r\nstill  a  member State - the then Federal leadership,\r\n\r\nand even the Barisan Sosialis had hopes that we would\r\n\r\nhe  caught in a difficult position to explain to  the\r\n\r\nworld the existence and the necessity for the foreign\r\n\r\nbases   in   Singapore.  However,   that   hope   and\r\n\r\nexpectation  did not turn out to he in their  favour,\r\n\r\nbecause  not  only the Afro-Asian countries  accepted\r\n\r\nthe existence, and the necessity of the existence, of\r\n\r\nthe   foreign  bases  in  Singapore  to  protect  our\r\n\r\nnational  integrity, but they have also gone  a  step\r\n\r\nfurther to justify the necessity of these bases. Even\r\n\r\nZambia,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  When  Zambia  ran  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties   with   the   neighbouring    Rhodesian\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the Zambian Government openly  requested\r\n\r\ntroops  he  sent, not to protect them but  to  attack\r\n\r\nRhodesia. But the British bases in Singapore are  not\r\n\r\nmeant to attack anybody. As I have said, they have no\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  attack anybody. They exist here  solely\r\n\r\nfor   the   purpose  of  defending  the   territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity of Singapore. But I agree we cannot  depend\r\n\r\nforever  on  others  to defend  us.  If  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  feel that the British bases should  go,  we\r\n\r\nsay yes. But not now. In the long run, yes. We cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  on  others  forever. If  they  can  give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment a scheme or a plan to settle or  to  solve\r\n\r\nthe   consequential  situation  arising  Out  of  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of the British bases, then we say  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared   to  consider  it.  Think  of  it.   40,000\r\n\r\nemployees,  and if each one has a family of  five  to\r\n\r\nfeed,  that means 200,000 mouths to feed.  This  will\r\n\r\nalso  affect  taxi  drivers,  provision  shop-owners,\r\n\r\ndomestic  servants under the employ of  British  army\r\n\r\npersonnel,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  a  whole host of other  incidental  and\r\n\r\nrelated trades. If the Barisan Sosialis can give us a\r\n\r\nsolid   plan  which  can  cope  with  this  kind   of\r\n\r\nsituation, where we have 200,000 hungry stomachs  and\r\n\r\nhungry  mouths to feed, then we say we will  consider\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever our shortcomings, whatever our\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  the years ahead, we  are  confident\r\n\r\nthat  in  ten years we will build up a new generation\r\n\r\nof  people under a multi-racial, multi-religious, and\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural  setup. But there is one  fear - not  a\r\n\r\nconscious fear though - whether or not our success\r\n\r\nin  ten  years will be regarded as a threat  or  even\r\n\r\nsubversive   to  the  leadership  of  a  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Did the Member say \"country\" or\r\n\r\n\"countries\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Country. These are not\r\n\r\nexaggerated or empty assumptions. As I said  earlier,\r\n\r\nthe  success of one country is hound to cast  shadows\r\n\r\non  the  success or failure of another  country,  let\r\n\r\nalone when these countries are so nearby to us. In  a\r\n\r\nshort  time to come, our industrialisation  programme\r\n\r\nwill  succeed,  and we must succeed. To  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members, the Jurong industrial complex is  a\r\n\r\nsham;  it  is  designed  only  to  build  up  a   few\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  But can they say that  these  factories\r\n\r\nand  the employment opportunities for 9,000 to 14,000\r\n\r\npeople  will  he  there had we  not  embarked  on  an\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme? They are not  there  for\r\n\r\nnothing.  They are there as a result of the  efforts,\r\n\r\nthe determination and the dynamism of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the next two or three years, the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\n-  he  is not here today - will find that he will have\r\n\r\nto face a very much different electorate from the one\r\n\r\nlie faced in 1963. Housing and social development, as\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has said in his Address,\r\n\r\nwill  proceed at an even faster pace. We have no fear\r\n\r\nof the days ahead. We have calculated, considered and\r\n\r\nset  our course. We know where we are travelling. We,\r\n\r\nof  course, cannot re-write the history of Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  pretend that we were never under  British\r\n\r\nrule;  that  we were never under Japanese occupation;\r\n\r\nthat we were never a part of Malaysia. We cannot\r\n\r\nre-shape  history. But what is to come we can shape  and\r\n\r\ninfluence.  In  the  short  years  to  come,  we  are\r\n\r\nconfident we can build up a generation and a  society\r\n\r\nthat  can  serve as an example to this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  In  ten years of the P.A.P., names have  been\r\n\r\ncalled of the P.A.P. - chauvinist, Fascist. But none,\r\n\r\nnot  even the Opposition, the Barisan Sosialis or the\r\n\r\nRight-wing,  could  accuse us of corruption.  And  we\r\n\r\nsincerely believe and we are convinced that  with  an\r\n\r\nhonest and incorruptible administration and with  the\r\n\r\ndynamism  of  the leadership, we can  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nbetter  distribution of the country's wealth  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. We assure them, everyone of them will have  a\r\n\r\nfair  share,  not  the way the Barisan  Sosialis  may\r\n\r\nthink - that \"from each according to his own ability,\r\n\r\nand  to  each  according to  his  need.\"  We  say  to\r\n\r\neveryone a fair share. Perhaps even now some  Members\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis will disapprove of armed and\r\n\r\nviolent  revolution for the simple reason  that  they\r\n\r\nmay  have now more things to protect and to treasure.\r\n\r\nSome  things  are  dear to them  that  they  have  to\r\n\r\nprotect  rather than to destroy. We call upon Members\r\n\r\nof   the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  reconsider,  to  \r\n\r\nre-orientate their thinking and adapt themselves to  the\r\n\r\nnew  situation, and not to go along with  meaningless\r\n\r\ndemonstrations,   empty  slogans   that   Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  is  phoney and a neo-colonialist  plot,\r\n\r\nbut  put themselves together and perhaps in that  way\r\n\r\ntheir survival could be prolonged, but not for long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this note I would like to\r\n\r\nassociate  myself  with  the  motion  by  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  to express the House's sincere thanks  for\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency's Speech made at the opening of  this\r\n\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish\r\n\r\nto  associate  myself  with  the  Prime  Minister  in\r\n\r\nthanking His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegara for his Speech to this House last week when he\r\n\r\ngraciously  declared  this  first  Parliament   open.\r\n\r\nBefore  I  proceed to the debate proper,  permit  me,\r\n\r\nSir,  to make an observation on the total absence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Members  of  the Opposition.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have pointed out in their Party organ and in\r\n\r\ntheir local newspapers the reasons for their Members'\r\n\r\nabsence  and  their  boycott of  this  Session.  This\r\n\r\nperformance on their part can be construed as an  act\r\n\r\nof   irresponsibility   to  the   constituents   they\r\n\r\nrepresent. The Members elected to this House  are  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  voice  of  the people  and  to  serve  their\r\n\r\nconstituents well. Time and again, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Members have stressed and maintained that\r\n\r\nthey  represent  the people. Curiously  enough,  they\r\n\r\nchoose to absent themselves from attending this first\r\n\r\nSession  of our Parliament, I really feel  sorry  for\r\n\r\nthe people who elected them, for they are now without\r\n\r\ntheir  representatives to voice  their  opinions  for\r\n\r\nthem  in  this  House. Instead of bringing  up  their\r\n\r\narguments in Parliament and facing up to the  replies\r\n\r\nof  Government  Back-benchers, the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nchoose  to  use the people as the vanguard for  their\r\n\r\nopinions.  Truth  is  what we cherish  and  truth  is\r\n\r\npainful  to  the Barisan Sosialis. But, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nwe on the Government Benches will continue to deliver\r\n\r\nour replies in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Barisan Sosialis'\r\n\r\nallegation  that  Singapore's  independence   is   an\r\n\r\nimperialist colonialist plot and, therefore,  phoney,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say this. This allegation denotes  stupidity\r\n\r\noil  their  part.  For  consequent  upon  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndeclaration of independence, a delegation led by  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister went to the United Nations  to\r\n\r\nseek  Singapore's admission into the world body.  And\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  admitted  into  the  United   Nations\r\n\r\nwithout   dissent,   not  even  an   abstention   nor\r\n\r\nopposition  to  admission was encountered.  Some  116\r\n\r\nmembers voted for our admission. Why is this  so?  If\r\n\r\nthe  independence of Singapore had been phoney,  then\r\n\r\nSingapore would have been rejected on application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when our Goodwill Mission went to\r\n\r\nthe  Afro-Asian  countries and some Eastern  European\r\n\r\ncountries   to  explain  to  them  the  circumstances\r\n\r\nleading  to  Singapore's eviction from Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nMission  found  sympathy  and understanding  wherever\r\n\r\nthey   went,  and  the  Mission  returned  home  with\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another allegation which the Barisan Sosialis made\r\n\r\nis  that  because of the presence of both the British\r\n\r\nmilitary  bases  and  some Malaysian  Army  units  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  after  the declaration of independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  this  independence  is  phoney.  To  this\r\n\r\nallegation it has been explicitly explained not  only\r\n\r\nto  the  world,  but in particular to the  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nworld,  that  the  presence of the British  bases  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for defending our territorial integrity and\r\n\r\nnational sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote from\r\n\r\ntoday's Straits Times, 15th December, back page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bases: You are quite right, says Zambia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zambia's Minister for the Western Provinces, Mr A.\r\n\r\nB. Mutemba, said today that Singapore was \"absolutely\r\n\r\njustified\" in retaining the British bases because  it\r\n\r\nwas not strong enough to defend itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that if there were no British bases the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of not only Singapore but also neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries like Malaysia, would he threatened.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Moreover,  talks  will he held soon with  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom Government to sign a bilateral defence treaty\r\n\r\nin which Britain would be responsible for the defence\r\n\r\nof  the territorial integrity and sovereignty of this\r\n\r\nisland  State, and that the bases would not  he  used\r\n\r\nfor aggressive purposes, it is also a well-known tact\r\n\r\nthat  military bases for defence purposes are  highly\r\n\r\nexpensive to set up and, therefore, cannot  be  built\r\n\r\nin one day, just as Rome was not built in a day. What\r\n\r\nhappens  if  we  ask the British to  dismantle  their\r\n\r\nbases  when  we  are not yet formidably  equipped  to\r\n\r\ndefend ourselves? We will then fall easy prey to  our\r\n\r\nhungry  hitter neighbours. This is what  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  would  like us to be - to  be  colonialised\r\n\r\nagain.

And as what the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture and Social Affairs has  pointed\r\n\r\nout  just now, the bases have directly been a  source\r\n\r\nof  livelihood  to some 200,000 of our population  of\r\n\r\n1.9 million. A helpless situation is what the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis would like to see happen, so that in a \r\n\r\nnon-stable  society  where hunger exists  and  where  the\r\n\r\npeople   are  demoralised  and  angry  with  a   weak\r\n\r\ngovernment, they could capitalise and seize power  in\r\n\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\ninstituted a campaign to recruit volunteers  for  our\r\n\r\nTerritorial Army for local defence. Again the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  came  out in open condemnation  of  such  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  and tried vigorously to get the people  not\r\n\r\nto  join.  Posters and handbills were  plastered  all\r\n\r\nover the place calling on the people not to join  the\r\n\r\nTerritorial Army. These posters and handbills claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore would not like to fight\r\n\r\ntheir  own people and that they wished to eat  bread.\r\n\r\nDid they succeed? Far from it. They failed miserably,\r\n\r\nfor   the   response  to  our  country's   call   was\r\n\r\noverwhelming.  And I am quite positive  that  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  next year our first batch of  Territorial\r\n\r\nArmy volunteers would have been adequately trained to\r\n\r\nassist  in the local defence of our country.  Let  me\r\n\r\nmake  this point clear to the Barisan Sosialis.  They\r\n\r\nneed  not  fear,  because  the  Territorial  Army  is\r\n\r\nintended to safeguard our national integrity.  But  I\r\n\r\nsay  this:  to  those  who  resort  to  violence  and\r\n\r\nunconstitutional  methods,  thereby  threatening  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of our country, then we will not hesitate to\r\n\r\ndeal with them firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to dwell a little on\r\n\r\nour  foreign policy. First, I would like to draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of this House to the noteworthy success  of\r\n\r\nthe  Goodwill  Mission headed  by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to the Afro-Asian and some Eastern European\r\n\r\ncountries. The Mission took pains to explain to these\r\n\r\ncountries not only our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  regarding the presence of foreign  military\r\n\r\nbases  in Singapore but also our non-aligned  policy,\r\n\r\nand  to win and to establish friendly ties with them.\r\n\r\nWe  are  non-aligned in any of the world  power  bloc\r\n\r\nconflicts,  be it Western or Eastern. We wish  to  be\r\n\r\nfriends with whoever wishes to be friends with us, so\r\n\r\nlong as our domestic affairs are not interfered with.\r\n\r\nAs His Excellency has said in his gracious Address - here, I quote [Hansard, 8th December, 1965, col. 11]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our security depends upon having the minimum\r\n\r\nnumber of unfriendly countries and the maximum number\r\n\r\nof friendly ones.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  this non-aligned policy is very necessary for our\r\n\r\nsurvival. Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, may  I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom  today's Straits Times on Zambia's attitude,  or\r\n\r\nZambia's support to such a policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Zambia's Minister for the Western Provinces, Mr\r\n\r\nA. B. Mutemba, ... described Singapore's foreign policy\r\n\r\nas \"practical and far-sighted.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He went on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"As a young nation you could not have done\r\n\r\nbetter.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In being friendly, we are not to be construed as meek\r\n\r\nand weak and that the internal affairs of our country\r\n\r\ncan  be  tampered with. Non-interference in  internal\r\n\r\naffairs should be the basis and prerequisite  to  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of friendliness. With  this  clear-cut\r\n\r\npolicy,  we  will  maintain  our  survival  in   this\r\n\r\nturbulent part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some countries which have bilateral\r\n\r\ndefence treaties and which are non-aligned, and  they\r\n\r\nhave   not  been  branded  as  neo-colonialists, in\r\n\r\npursuing  a  non-aligned attitude we are prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept economic, technical, military, and foreign aid\r\n\r\nwithout  prejudice. You see, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  only carry out policies  after  much\r\n\r\nmeticulous  deliberation  and  planning,  unlike  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis who act on impulses. I would like to\r\n\r\npose this question to the Barisan Sosialis since they\r\n\r\nhave  been  shouting slogans of phoney  independence,\r\n\r\nneo-colonialist  and imperialist plot.  What  happens\r\n\r\nwhen Peking or Djakarta decides to recognise us? What\r\n\r\nhave the Barisan Sosialis got to say on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is about the\r\n\r\neducation system of our country. It is heartening  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  as from next year the study of  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  beginning  with  Secondary  1,   will   be\r\n\r\ncompulsory  in  all secondary schools and  that  this\r\n\r\nsecond  language will be additional to the medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction. This is a big step forward  towards  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of  a  multi-linguistic  and  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety  in  which young students in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety  will  not only be able to converse  in  more\r\n\r\nthan  one  language but also write in and  understand\r\n\r\nmore  than  one language, and who will be geared  for\r\n\r\ntheir future role as the leaders of tomorrow when the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of government falls squarely on  their\r\n\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I notice, an emphasis on scientific,\r\n\r\nvocational and technical education to meet the  needs\r\n\r\nof  industrialisation. I think our  education  system\r\n\r\nneeds   a   careful  reappraisal   because   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  We  are developing  a  generation  of\r\n\r\ncertificate-conscious  and  utility-conscious  people\r\n\r\nand  there is apparently little or no attention  paid\r\n\r\nto  developing  the innate talents of  the  children,\r\n\r\nculturally  or otherwise. Because the young  students\r\n\r\nhave so many subjects in their school curriculum  and\r\n\r\nwith  these  topics upper-most in their  minds,  they\r\n\r\nhave  practically little or no time at all to develop\r\n\r\ntheir  cultural  talents,  May  I  propose  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry    of   Education   see   to   the    proper\r\n\r\nchannelisation  of  time  and  effort   towards   the\r\n\r\nteaching  of the appreciation of art, music, culture,\r\n\r\nand  the  fine  arts in the school curriculum  which,\r\n\r\nafter  all,  is  part  of the  development  of  human\r\n\r\npersonality. Although technicians and skilled workers\r\n\r\nare  required in the industrialisation of our country\r\n\r\nas  industry  develops, a non-Communist,  democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist government should also see to it  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  also  know  how  to  enjoy  their   leisure\r\n\r\nprofitably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although Singapore is now out of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaysia, I still maintain that the\r\n\r\npeople  of  both territories are still one  and  that\r\n\r\nnothing can prevent the people from thinking  as  one\r\n\r\npeople - the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth  Malaysia and Singapore. For more than 140 years\r\n\r\nboth  territories  were ruled by  the  same  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters,   shared  the  same  masters,  and   jointly\r\n\r\nstruggled for independence so as to he free from  the\r\n\r\nshackles of colonialism. This was achieved, hut  both\r\n\r\nwere to be separated after barely two years. Both are\r\n\r\naware  that whatever happens in one territory,  there\r\n\r\nwill  he repercussions in the other. Both are \r\n\r\ninter-dependent of each other on a long-term basis in order\r\n\r\nto  survive,  for the simple reason that  the  people\r\n\r\nshare a common destiny. This artificial separation by\r\n\r\na  legal  stroke is not going to make the people  who\r\n\r\nwas  one, into two separate peoples. I sincerely hope\r\n\r\nthat   sometime  in  the  not  too  distant   future,\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia will be hack in one  fold  and\r\n\r\nbecome one people in which a Malaysian Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I wish to\r\n\r\nbring   out   is  about  the  White  Paper   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  family planning policy. It  is  out  of\r\n\r\npersonal and religious convictions that I would  like\r\n\r\nto deal with this. Furthermore, I feel certain that I\r\n\r\nam  speaking  for  quite  a large  proportion  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents who share my views on this matter.  Now,\r\n\r\nall of us realise that irresponsible parenthood is  a\r\n\r\nbad thing, both for the individuals concerned and for\r\n\r\nthe  State.  I  would  he very happy,  therefore,  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the Government in a campaign to educate  the\r\n\r\npeople   towards  a  more  responsible  attitude   to\r\n\r\nparenthood. But after reading this White Paper, I get\r\n\r\nthe  impression that the Government is  proposing  an\r\n\r\nover-simplified  solution to  a  very  complex  human\r\n\r\nproblem.  There are some assumptions in this document\r\n\r\nthat  I  would  question. For  instance,  that  small\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  happier than large ones.  Many  of  us\r\n\r\nhere,  I  am  sure, have been happily brought  up  in\r\n\r\nfamilies, not of two or three children but of five or\r\n\r\nmore.  We  have  seen  the good results  of  such  an\r\n\r\nupbringing  where children are taught discipline  and\r\n\r\ntolerance, self-sacrifice and a willingness to  help,\r\n\r\nin short, those virtues most needed in society today.\r\n\r\nWe  are  always  hearing about  the  unusually  large\r\n\r\nfamilies of 14 or 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren living in miserable conditions. Let  us  not\r\n\r\nforget  the many moderately large healthy  and  happy\r\n\r\nfamilies  who are living in modest comfort. My  point\r\n\r\nis  that  it is one thing to provide advice and  help\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  wish to space their children  or  to\r\n\r\nlimit the size of their families. It is another thing\r\n\r\naltogether  to  start a campaign aimed at  persuading\r\n\r\npeople to have small families whether they like it or\r\n\r\nnot.  The  White  Paper  constantly  says  that   its\r\n\r\nintention is to increase the happiness of families in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But I disagree with the view that families\r\n\r\nof two or three children are necessarily happier than\r\n\r\nlarger families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the White Paper states that it is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention to advise the  woman  at  her\r\n\r\nrequest  of  the  best  available  method  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning. I have nothing against this, hut I seek the\r\n\r\nassurance of the Minister for Health that no pressure\r\n\r\nwould  he  put on anybody to volunteer for artificial\r\n\r\nmethods  of birth control. For instance,  to  tell  a\r\n\r\nwoman,  whose  family  due to financial  difficulties\r\n\r\nhave  to  accept public assistance, that  unless  she\r\n\r\nconsents  to  family planning, she may  not  get  any\r\n\r\nassistance  at all, would, in my opinion, be  nothing\r\n\r\nshort of moral blackmail. This would be victimisation\r\n\r\nof  the poor. What worries me is that I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper makes it sufficiently clear that the\r\n\r\nGovernment    recognises   the    fact    that    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for deciding on the number of children\r\n\r\nthey  want  belongs to the parents alone.  The  State\r\n\r\nexists  to  help families, not the other  way  round.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of the slogan \"Family Planning for\r\n\r\nAll\",  I  would prefer to see the slogan \"Responsible\r\n\r\nParenthood for All\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the White Paper seems to\r\n\r\nignore  completely the fact that there  are  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands  in Singapore who do not consider  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  methods  mentioned  here as  morally  acceptable\r\n\r\nforms of family planning. They consider that marriage\r\n\r\nis  a  noble  and demanding vocation  and  that  true\r\n\r\nhappiness in marriage requires self-sacrifice,  \r\n\r\nself-control  and  cannot he achieved just  by  mechanical\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Everybody must be free to  follow  his  own\r\n\r\nconscience in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  I seek an assurance from the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nthat  doctors  and nurses in Government Service  will\r\n\r\nnot  be required to act against their consciences  by\r\n\r\nbeing  ordered  to  do  things  which  they  consider\r\n\r\nmorally wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that I do not find in the White Paper any\r\n\r\nmention of the dignity of marriage and parenthood and\r\n\r\nof  the necessity for a careful all-round preparation\r\n\r\nfor  this  noble  vocation. In my opinion,  too  much\r\n\r\nstress is put on material prosperity, as if it  alone\r\n\r\nwill  bring  happiness. There is  nothing  about  the\r\n\r\nimportance of educating our people to become  morally\r\n\r\nmature responsible citizens. All the emphasis  is  on\r\n\r\nmaterial happiness and mechanical control, and what I\r\n\r\nfear  is that in lowering our population rate by  the\r\n\r\nsort  of  campaign envisaged here, we  are  in  grave\r\n\r\ndanger  of  lowering  the whole  moral  tone  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  We  are producing a generation of  soft  and\r\n\r\nthoroughly selfish people, interested solely in their\r\n\r\nown  comfort, lacking the vigour and generosity which\r\n\r\nare  so  vital  to our nation today. If  this  should\r\n\r\nhappen, the cure, in my opinion, would be much  worse\r\n\r\nthan the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, permit me to support the Motion\r\n\r\nmoved by the Hon, the Prime Minister on the Speech by\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara to the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will agree with me if I say\r\n\r\nperhaps nobody, whether those inside this Chamber  or\r\n\r\nthose  outside  this Chamber, would be  surprised  on\r\n\r\nhearing   the   formal  proclamation  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  on the 9th of August.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\ncustomary,  of course, that every marriage  sometimes\r\n\r\nends  up  in a divorce or breaks up, except that  the\r\n\r\nreasons for the separation must be studied as a guide\r\n\r\nfor  our future generation, and we shall leave it  to\r\n\r\nthe  historians to find out and assess  in  the  hope\r\n\r\nthat it will be a guide for posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we know that Singapore with the\r\n\r\nStates  comprising Malaysia are one, not one in  name\r\n\r\nbut one from a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhistorical  and  geographical  point  of  view.   The\r\n\r\nseparation of Singapore from Malaysia is a  very  sad\r\n\r\nevent  indeed. Singapore, with its strategic position\r\n\r\nin  the  world,  is just a mere dot. Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall island State and known as the smallest Republic\r\n\r\nin  South-East Asia. As a result of the separation of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from Malaysia, we have heard many  leaders\r\n\r\nsaying that separation of Singapore from Malaysia was\r\n\r\nconsented  to  by both parties. But, Mr  Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  emphasise  in  this  Chamber   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was evicted from Malaysia.  If  a  husband\r\n\r\nwishes  to  divorce his wife, he gives an  ultimatum,\r\n\r\n\"Out  you go\" or \"Stay in this house.\" If you stayed,\r\n\r\nyou  would  be faced with difficulties,  and  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the family or the children, you  must  go\r\n\r\nout.  Therefore, there is no alternative for the wife\r\n\r\nbut  to leave the house at the behest of the husband.\r\n\r\nThat is the fate that has befallen Singapore. On  the\r\n\r\n9th of August, I - and there were many others like me\r\n\r\nin Singapore - was worried about the fate of this small\r\n\r\nisland  of ours. But after the storm has abated,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  clear, the spirit  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  their determination to live, to  survive,\r\n\r\nis there. And we hope that Singapore will continue to\r\n\r\nlive  and survive on the same equal status with other\r\n\r\nnations throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go further, Mr Speaker, let me touch\r\n\r\nbriefly  on  the  question of the Opposition  Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers  who have boycotted not only the  debates  in\r\n\r\nthis   Chamber  but  also  boycotted  the  Ceremonial\r\n\r\nOpening of the Assembly by His Excellency our Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara. This is an indication which  is  not\r\n\r\nhealthy  to  us,  because the  step  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  in boycotting the Ceremonial  Opening  by\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as Head  of\r\n\r\nState of this country, is an unhealthy indication, an\r\n\r\nill  omen, and a mark of disrespect for the  Head  of\r\n\r\nState  and also for the Assembly. The boycott by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   and   their   unwillingness   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the open argument  -  they  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to come face to face with the Government \r\n\r\nmeans  that  they have betrayed the trust  placed  in\r\n\r\nthem by their constituents that they can voice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir   grievances  in  this  Chamber  so  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   may   take   remedial   measures   where\r\n\r\nnecessary. Their avoidance of open argument is deeply\r\n\r\ndeplored by the people of Singapore who wish  to  see\r\n\r\nSingapore  prosper as a democratic society.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  meaning  if  this Chamber  is  empty?  Are  they\r\n\r\nagainst  a democratic society? Are they to depend  on\r\n\r\nnews  items  from  the newspapers? If  they  consider\r\n\r\nnewspapers are more important than this Chamber, then\r\n\r\nwe  can  go back to the people and let the people  be\r\n\r\nthe  judges, and let them decide whether they want  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic State or otherwise. This boycott is not  a\r\n\r\nboycott of the Government alone but a boycott of  the\r\n\r\nwishes   of   the  people  who  desire  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore. And this, Mr Speaker,  shows\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  indications of a  break-up  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, because if they attend the debate,\r\n\r\nthey cannot see eye to eye with each other on certain\r\n\r\nmatters,  as  it has been reported in the  newspapers\r\n\r\nthat  there  are frictions in the Party  between  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing and the Left-wing. An allegation that this\r\n\r\nAssembly  serves no useful purpose, unlike  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  was voiced by the ex-Member for  Hong  Lim,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng  Guan, who resigned his  seat  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber, thereby creating a by-election which he  did\r\n\r\nnot contest. I think this was more honourable. If the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis maintain that this Assembly is of no\r\n\r\nuse,  how  is it that they contested the by-election?\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately for them, they were defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they further allege that Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence   is  phoney.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   if\r\n\r\nSingapore's independence is phoney, how do we explain\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis' attitude to all the  countries\r\n\r\nin  this world who have extended their recognition of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence? Do they think  that  those\r\n\r\ncountries which have recognised our independence  are\r\n\r\nphoney     \"independent\"    countries?     Therefore,\r\n\r\nindirectly,  they are alleging that  these  countries\r\n\r\nare  phoney independent countries; they are therefore\r\n\r\ndenigrating these independent countries. This word\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"phoney\" has been on the lips of the Opposition  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the  formation  of Malaysia  was  mooted.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have had occasion to allege that the\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation  was\r\n\r\nphoney.  This  term \"phoney\" is used  freely  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members. The Barisan Sosialis sent  three\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to sit in the Malaysian  Parliament.\r\n\r\nIf  it  was a phoney merger, why did they not boycott\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  Parliament  by  not  sending   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   there?   But   they   sent    three\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to sit in the Malaysian  Parliament,\r\n\r\nso  that they could each receive an allowance of $750\r\n\r\nper  month,  free train tickets and other  amenities.\r\n\r\nAnd  now again they say that Singapore's independence\r\n\r\nis  phoney.  They  receive their allowance  but  they\r\n\r\nabsent themselves from this Assembly! On our side, we\r\n\r\nreceive our allowance and we attend meetings. On  the\r\n\r\nother side, they too receive their allowance but they\r\n\r\nabsent  themselves. So, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing that is not phoney. Everything that we do  is\r\n\r\nwrong. There is a Malay song entitled, \"Anything that\r\n\r\nwe  do is wrong.\" But the only thing that is right is\r\n\r\nif  Singapore became a colony of a foreign country to\r\n\r\nwhich the Barisan Sosialis owe their allegiance. Such\r\n\r\nan  action  would  then he right in  their  eyes - the\r\n\r\nsurrender of our sovereignty to a foreign country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now we must be far-sighted and\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  future.  The  future  of  our  State\r\n\r\ndepends,  firstly, on the various  people  living  in\r\n\r\nharmony,  secondly,  on  political  stability   which\r\n\r\nensures  industrialisation  and,  thirdly,   on   the\r\n\r\npeople's   determination  to  progress.   These   are\r\n\r\nimportant  points  we  are faced  with  so  that  our\r\n\r\ncountry may prosper in future. Singapore, a sovereign\r\n\r\nand  independent  State which will be  known  as  the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Singapore is the smallest State in \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia. It is only a tiny dot in the eyes of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It  will be a beautiful garden in which  many\r\n\r\nkinds  of flowers and trees will be planted. We  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  look after the trees to prevent them  from\r\n\r\nbeing  destroyed by pests. We should not forget  that\r\n\r\nthere are disruptive elements who will go all out  in\r\n\r\nfuture to wreck our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nharmony,  as  stated in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech:  firstly,  the  communalistic  elements,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  Communists.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nheadquarters of narrow Malay communalism  is  not  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   but  outside  Singapore.  This   communal\r\n\r\nfeeling was fanned at the time when Singapore  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  State  in Malaysia. If you, Mr Speaker,  are\r\n\r\nfollowing the speeches and articles appearing in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language  newspapers daily,  there  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsingle  day  in  which  there  are  no  speeches  and\r\n\r\narticles by leaders outside Singapore which  whip  up\r\n\r\ncommunal feelings in order to disrupt the harmony not\r\n\r\nonly  of the people of Singapore but of the whole  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia. We are very concerned with this group which\r\n\r\nhas  its headquarters outside Singapore. On the  very\r\n\r\nday  that  Singapore was separated from  Malaysia,  a\r\n\r\nleader  from  the  Federation came  here  to  give  a\r\n\r\nguarantee  to  the Malays in Singapore that  although\r\n\r\nSingapore had been evicted from Malaysia, their  fate\r\n\r\nand  destiny would be looked after, and that if  they\r\n\r\ncould   not  bear  the  hardships  under  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they would be received  with  open  arms\r\n\r\nacross  the Causeway into Johore. This was the  tenor\r\n\r\nof  the  speech  made by a Malay leader  designed  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  Malay organisations so that  the  250,000\r\n\r\nMalays in Singapore will go across the Causeway  into\r\n\r\nJohore  and Singapore will appear as a Chinese  State\r\n\r\non  the surface. Is it his intention to create  chaos\r\n\r\nin  this  country? I am a Malay, and I  say  that  we\r\n\r\nMalays  have  never  migrated. I  consider  that  the\r\n\r\nspirit of migration is a cowardly spirit. The various\r\n\r\nraces  must  live in peace and understanding.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  those  people  who  exhort  the  Malays  to\r\n\r\nmigrate are cowards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Speaker permits me, may I relate what\r\n\r\nhappened  in the Malaysian Parliament as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe   guarantee  that  the  people  from  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway would be prepared to welcome the Malays from\r\n\r\nSingapore? This concerns the movements of  people  to\r\n\r\nand  from Singapore. In the Berita Harian of the 18th\r\n\r\nNovember, there was a news item- \"800 Malays will  go\r\n\r\nto  Johore in 1965.\" A small headline only.  But  the\r\n\r\nUtusan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelayu,  on the other hand, carried a bold  headline.\r\n\r\n\"800  to quit Singapore.\" Mr Speaker, this piece  of\r\n\r\nnews  item is very sensational. On the same day, 18th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1965, in the Utusan Melayu,  the  contents\r\n\r\nread  as  follows: \"Kuala Lumpur, 17th November.  800\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  Singapore  citizens  have  applied  for\r\n\r\npermission  to  live in Johore, in  response  to  the\r\n\r\nexhortation  by the Prime Minister of Malaysia  after\r\n\r\nSingapore   became  separated  from  Malaysia.\"   \"In\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  call  of  the  Prime  Minister  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\"  And  according to this news,  the  Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has offered flats. The report  says  that\r\n\r\nthey  rejected  the offer because they realised  that\r\n\r\nthe  rentals  of  flats in Singapore  are  very  much\r\n\r\ncheaper than those in Johore. They are fully aware of\r\n\r\nthat.  Cost of construction of flats is much  cheaper\r\n\r\nin  Singapore than in Johore. But, Mr Speaker,  what\r\n\r\nis the motive of these 800 people who will migrate to\r\n\r\nJohore  Bahru? Are they people who work in Singapore?\r\n\r\nWhy  did  they  select Johore of all  places?  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  Johore  Bahru is separated  only  by \r\n\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from Singapore. They can  live  in\r\n\r\nJohore  and yet work in Singapore, because there  are\r\n\r\nno  employment opportunities for them in  Malaya.  So\r\n\r\nthe  intention is to collect revenue in Singapore and\r\n\r\nlive in Johore. But why not go to Pahang? Pahang is a\r\n\r\nmuch bigger State; or for that matter in Kelantan  or\r\n\r\nTrengganu?  It  is  because of the proximity  of  the\r\n\r\nplace.  Most of these 800 people were born in  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  they work in Singapore as Customs officials  and\r\n\r\nso on. Yet, it says in the newspapers that the Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  entertain applications  for  land\r\n\r\nfrom  Johore citizens. Is this not a dirty  political\r\n\r\ntactic towards the Singapore Government? Is this  not\r\n\r\na  dirty  tactic to divide the people of  Singapore?\r\n\r\n800  out of 250,000 people means that the Malays  are\r\n\r\nbeing   oppressed  in  Singapore?  I  say  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore is giving  more  privileged\r\n\r\ntreatment  to  the  Malays  in  Singapore  than   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government  is giving  to  the  Malays  in\r\n\r\nMalaya. These are indications that ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

In Singapore there exist groups  who  are\r\n\r\nagitating the Malays to move out to Malaya. There are\r\n\r\nsuch elements, yes. When they do migrate they hope to\r\n\r\nmove  to Johore in a procession. I would like to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  these  leaders  who have  called  for  their\r\n\r\nmigration will be among them. They are urging  others\r\n\r\nto  go.  But they stay put in Singapore because  they\r\n\r\nknow they can enjoy the comfort and luxury here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Mr Speaker, the other elements who try to\r\n\r\nhoodwink  the people, the communalistic elements  who\r\n\r\nuse  language  as an issue in order  to  disrupt  our\r\n\r\nunity, do not come from the Malays only but also from\r\n\r\nnon-Malays. Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English are now\r\n\r\nthe  four  official languages in this  country,  with\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the  common language. Malay has  now  been\r\n\r\naccepted  as  the national language.  This  has  come\r\n\r\nabout  because  of the foresight of  people  who  are\r\n\r\naware  of this problem. Hence, we can create a  happy\r\n\r\nand prosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think I need not elaborate on the\r\n\r\nachievements  which we have made in Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nare  well  known. On housing, for instance, every  45\r\n\r\nminutes one unit of flat is being built. But  what  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say on housing is the problem which the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board is facing.  When  they\r\n\r\nembark  upon  a  project they  face  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nacquiring sites, especially when the sites are  being\r\n\r\noccupied   by   squatters.  This  is   our   problem.\r\n\r\nObscurantist forces are exploiting this situation. If\r\n\r\nthe  sites  acquired belong to the Malays, they  will\r\n\r\nspread   wild  propaganda  that  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nevicting and suppressing the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is the propaganda used by Malay extremists.  If\r\n\r\nthe  squatters affected are Chinese, then the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis will exploit the situation. They will  shout\r\n\r\nat  the  top of their voice and accuse the Government\r\n\r\nof wanting to evict the squatters. There are elements\r\n\r\nin Singapore who are out to disrupt our unity. We pay\r\n\r\ncompensation and provide alternative accommodation to\r\n\r\nthese  squatters in such a way that they are prepared\r\n\r\nto accept the Government's scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the problem also arises when there are\r\n\r\npeople who do not wish to see progress. They consider\r\n\r\nflats  as pigeon-holes. They say Malays cannot  adapt\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  live  in flats.  Mr  Speaker,  I  am\r\n\r\nastounded  at  this.  Pigeon-holes  have   now   been\r\n\r\nconverted into a haven which everyone is rushing for!\r\n\r\nPreviously they have charged that these fiats are fit\r\n\r\nonly  as  pigeon-holes. But they themselves  are  now\r\n\r\noccupying and living in these flats. Why do I mention\r\n\r\nthis,  Mr  Speaker? We are prepared  to  accept  any\r\n\r\ncriticism or condemnation. When the Government wanted\r\n\r\nto  sell flats to the Malays, these elements agitated\r\n\r\nthem  not  to  buy  them. But when  they  became  the\r\n\r\nintermediaries,  they purchased the  flats  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and in turn sold them to the Malays.  The\r\n\r\nmiddleman  gets the credit! I appeal  to  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned to he prepared to give and take. This is  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  Government is  faced  with  squatter\r\n\r\nproblems, resettlement and so on. I appeal to them to\r\n\r\nco-operate  with the Government and come  forward  to\r\n\r\naccept Government's scheme to build flats. Then there\r\n\r\nis  some  meaning  to it. But if  in  the  course  of\r\n\r\nbuilding the flats, they buy the flats and sell them,\r\n\r\nthen they become like brokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Speech of his Excellency the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  I  am  impressed  when  he\r\n\r\ntouches  upon the proposed setting up of a Commission\r\n\r\nto  guarantee  the  rights of every individual.  This\r\n\r\nCommission  will  hear the views of  the  minorities,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  racial,  linguistic and religious  angles.\r\n\r\nTheir  opinions will be carefully considered by  this\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when I returned from New Zealand I\r\n\r\nread all the back issues of the newspapers. This will\r\n\r\nbe  ammunition to certain groups of people, for  they\r\n\r\ncan  charge  that the Government have  neglected  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the  minorities. In fact, immediately  on\r\n\r\nseparation,  the  Prime  Minister  himself   gave   a\r\n\r\nguarantee  on  the position of the Malays  and  other\r\n\r\nminority  groups  in  Singapore.  Therefore,  if   we\r\n\r\nimplement  this, it is not because it is forced  upon\r\n\r\nus.  If  we  advance, it is not because we are  being\r\n\r\npushed by them from behind. We carry this out in full\r\n\r\nconsciousness, with a full sense of responsibility to\r\n\r\ncreate a multi-racial and multi-religious society  in\r\n\r\nour  independent State. To them, I say,  do  not  use\r\n\r\nthis  as  a  weapon  to create dissension  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious  races  in our State. With a  full  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility we must ponder over this for  our  own\r\n\r\nsafety and that of posterity, because our policy  now\r\n\r\nis to survive. That is basic and fundamental. We want\r\n\r\nto survive. And we will survive according to the real\r\n\r\nphilosophical means of survival. We cannot live  like\r\n\r\nwild  boars.  We  cannot  depend  on  other  people's\r\n\r\nbounty.  We cannot live like dogs or like cats  which\r\n\r\neat only the remnants. We want to live and survive as\r\n\r\nan  independent  people, equal in status  with  other\r\n\r\nindependent peoples of the world. That is  our  basic\r\n\r\nphilosophy,  and we are determined to find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to live and survive. For this, we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  make  friends with anybody, provided it does  not\r\n\r\njeopardise our security. We are on the best of  terms\r\n\r\nwith the East European and African countries for  our\r\n\r\ninterest. Yes, we will make friends. We are not going\r\n\r\nto  make friends with countries which are not sincere\r\n\r\nin  wanting  to  make friends with  us.  We  must  be\r\n\r\ncareful when we shake hands with countries which  can\r\n\r\npoison  us.  Mr Speaker, I would like  to  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat our desire is to make friends with all countries\r\n\r\nand  to live in peace, but not at the expense of  our\r\n\r\nbirthright and our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Although there was rejoicing  for  the  newly\r\n\r\nacquired  freedom,  there was  also  uncertainty  and\r\n\r\nanxiety  amongst many people in Singapore as to  what\r\n\r\ntheir future would be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech which was delivered by the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan   Negara  last  Wednesday in this First\r\n\r\nParliament  outlining the policy of  this  Government\r\n\r\nwas  most inspiring and most significant. The Address\r\n\r\nwas very brief, but it gave our people the confidence\r\n\r\nand  hope  for  the  future as the  approach  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems    is   correct.   Faced   with   Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation then and now, and an unfriendly Central\r\n\r\nGovernment who simply wanted to suppress  us  in  all\r\n\r\nforms and see us down, it is reassuring to note  that\r\n\r\nthe leaders of our people are resolute and determined\r\n\r\nthat  we  survive, that we succeed, and,  above  all,\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  be intimidated. I need not recall  events\r\n\r\nwhich  led to our independence, but with independence\r\n\r\nnew problems have been brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now we have been able to withstand Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  We managed to isolate the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  kept the Communalists down. We would be  foolish\r\n\r\nto  assume  that  the Communists will  not  intensify\r\n\r\ntheir activities to create chaos and to recover  lost\r\n\r\nground,  nor  can we overrule the fact that  communal\r\n\r\nextremists   will  not  emerge  to  take   over   the\r\n\r\nleadership of our immediate neighbouring country,  as\r\n\r\nwas  reported in the Straits Times of 14th  December,\r\n\r\n1965   - the  Prime  Minister  of  our   immediate\r\n\r\nneighbouring country\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  criticised for making a declaration to  consider\r\n\r\nthe call for the liberal use of other languages. When\r\n\r\nsuch leaders do assume power, they are bound to cause\r\n\r\na  lot  of misery to the people, and whatever happens\r\n\r\nin that country is hound to affect us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when such hostile actions are\r\n\r\ndirected  against us, we must ensure that  they  will\r\n\r\nnot  succeed in a multi-racial, multi-lingual,\r\n\r\nmulti-religious society like ours, any other form of policy\r\n\r\npursued  to  establish a one race, one language,  and\r\n\r\none religion is hound to create chaos for its people.\r\n\r\nWith our independence, Mr Speaker, the prospects  of\r\n\r\nour  succeeding  in  establishing a  tolerant \r\n\r\nmulti-racial society are much greater, and our results  and\r\n\r\nsuccesses  are  hound  to  have  an  impact  on   our\r\n\r\nneighbours in contrast to what they are pursuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this First Session of Parliament, I\r\n\r\nwelcome the Prime Minister's call to the Backbenchers\r\n\r\nto  perform the role of the Opposition as a result of\r\n\r\nthe decision of the Barisan Sosialis Members opposite\r\n\r\nto boycott this Assembly. As elected Members, we have\r\n\r\nan  obligation  to our electorate,  and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers, by staying away, have forfeited their  right\r\n\r\nto  open  argument and open debate. What can  be  the\r\n\r\nintentions of this boycott? Are they planning a  mass\r\n\r\nby-election or will they resort to armed struggle?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on certain subjects and policies of the Government. Housing has been a successful achievement of the P.A.P. Government in the first five years, according to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech, we produced 51,000 units of low-cost housing. What was more important\r\n\r\nwas  the  scheme for home ownership for  the  people,\r\n\r\nwhich has offered the public about 3,500 units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the second Five-Year housing programme; it is\r\n\r\nstated  in  the Speech that the number of  units  for\r\n\r\nsale to meet increasing demands will he decided upon.\r\n\r\nHere  I  would like to urge the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nconsider  and encourage our people to own  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes,  if  it  is  within their means,  rather  than\r\n\r\nrenting them from the Housing Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One deterrent factor which prevents the people from\r\n\r\nowning  their own homes is the cash deposit which,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, is about one-fifth of the total cost of  the\r\n\r\nhouse.  A  good many people cannot afford  this  down\r\n\r\npayment deposit, but if an arrangement can be  agreed\r\n\r\nupon, I am sure the home ownership scheme wilI have a\r\n\r\ngreat   response.  In  this  respect,  I   have   two\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to  offer to the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. Will he consider amending legislation to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Provident Fund  to  allow  people  with\r\n\r\nadequate  contributions to use them as  security  for\r\n\r\nthe  down payment? The other alternative is  whether\r\n\r\nhe  will allow employers, as has been done in private\r\n\r\ncompanies, to stand as sureties for the down payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal of the Government to\r\n\r\nre-register the population by issuing them  with  new\r\n\r\nidentity  cards is welcome. There are in Singapore  a\r\n\r\ngreat number of people who are born in Singapore with\r\n\r\nbirth certificates without their names on them.  This\r\n\r\nproblem  has caused a lot of hardship and uncertainty\r\n\r\nto  many  Singapore  citizens who wonder  what  their\r\n\r\nfuture  will be. I would ask the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nto   consider   a  scheme  where  bona   fide   birth\r\n\r\ncertificate holders can have their new identity cards\r\n\r\nregistered as being Singapore citizens without having\r\n\r\nto  go  through  the  arduous  process  of  obtaining\r\n\r\ncitizenship again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, on the establishment of missions\r\n\r\nabroad,  I  would like to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to the new issue of passports for Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   on   Singapore  becoming  an   independent\r\n\r\nsovereign nation. We are at the present moment  still\r\n\r\nusing  pre-Malaysian passports, and visas  and  entry\r\n\r\npermits  for permission to enter Singapore are  still\r\n\r\nbeing   undertaken  abroad  either  by  the   British\r\n\r\nConsulates or the Malaysian Embassies. I feel that to\r\n\r\nprolong  this unnecessarily would have a  detrimental\r\n\r\neffect  on our country. We would rather see  our  own\r\n\r\nmissions  abroad  and  our own  staff  handling  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Speech of His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara on Finance, col.  16  of\r\n\r\nHansard states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The basic economic challenge is one of providing\r\n\r\nremunerative   and  meaningful  employment   to   our\r\n\r\npredominantly youthful people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am drawing the attention ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

This policy\r\n\r\nis to the interest of our country. Not very long ago,\r\n\r\nthe  Government announced its policy of  raising  the\r\n\r\nstandard of the second language in all schools and to\r\n\r\ntrain  teachers to teach the second language  in  all\r\n\r\nthe  schools. The expenditure on education has  shown\r\n\r\nthat  education plays a very important  role  in  our\r\n\r\nGovernment policy. The people in Singapore are  fully\r\n\r\naware that our nation achieved independence only four\r\n\r\nmonths   ago.  We  are  in  a  very  critical  stage.\r\n\r\nEverything  must  be  started  afresh  and  our  task\r\n\r\nforward  is full of difficulties. Apart from charting\r\n\r\na  course  for  prosperity, we  must  also  see  that\r\n\r\neducation is being promoted. In his speech, the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara has outlined this policy,  but  the\r\n\r\nanti-national elements have neglected  to  admit  all\r\n\r\nthe  achievements of the Government. They have  tried\r\n\r\nevery  means  to  make use of the language  issue  to\r\n\r\nwreck the unity and solidarity of the people. Such an\r\n\r\nact should be condemned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education poses no problem in our\r\n\r\ncountry.  All along, our Government has been pursuing\r\n\r\na  policy which treats the various streams of schools\r\n\r\nequally.  Our  Government's policy on education  also\r\n\r\nlays  stress  on technical and vocational  education.\r\n\r\nAll  this is reflected in the policy speech. From the\r\n\r\nfinancial   figures,  we  can  also  see   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has spent a lot of money on education.  It\r\n\r\nhas  not neglected its duty to nurture our youth.  It\r\n\r\nis  prepared to shoulder more difficult burdens,  but\r\n\r\nthere are anti-national elements who try to make  use\r\n\r\nof   the  culture  and  language  issues,  which  are\r\n\r\nexplosive  in  nature, in order to wreck  the  social\r\n\r\norder and to undermine and topple the Government.  We\r\n\r\ndo not have to waste time by arguing with them but we\r\n\r\nshould expose their irresponsible acts and speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the incidents at the Nantah campus, we\r\n\r\ncan  see that anti-national elements have tried their\r\n\r\nvery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest to seize any opportunity, without regard to  the\r\n\r\nconsequences,  to create chaos and  disorder  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety by shouting slogans, \"Anti this and that\"  in\r\n\r\norder  to create more unnecessary trouble and burdens\r\n\r\nfor  our  society.  What is more abominable  is  that\r\n\r\nthese  people are not facing reality. They are  \r\n\r\nanti-national.  Their political ideology has been  brought\r\n\r\ninto  the university campus to create trouble  there;\r\n\r\nbut  on  the other hand, they dare not explain  their\r\n\r\nactions and the motives for their behaviour. For  the\r\n\r\npast  few days, we have not been able to see  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Members  in  this  House.  They  are\r\n\r\nashamed of what they have done. That is why they dare\r\n\r\nnot  come here to attend the solemn sittings that are\r\n\r\nheld in this Parliament. If they are ashamed of their\r\n\r\nacts,  it  is  some consolation for our nation.  They\r\n\r\nhave  neglected their responsibility.  Instead,  they\r\n\r\nare  creating trouble outside the House, and they  do\r\n\r\nnot  recognise  that  Singapore  is  independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign. Are they really representing the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  people or are they trying to  sell  out  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must justify what I have asserted just now. Let\r\n\r\nus  see  what  the Opposition Party has published  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Party organ. These articles boil down to  this\r\n\r\npoint:  they are geared to create trouble. All  these\r\n\r\narticles  are meant to distort facts. In the November 6th issue of Barisan - their Party organ - their \r\n\r\nso-called  actions at the University, their  indulgences\r\n\r\nin  all  sorts  of  irresponsible acts  such  as  the\r\n\r\nburning  of  furniture  and  wrecking  of  university\r\n\r\nequipment are mentioned. All these actions  on  their\r\n\r\npart  are  meant to lead our young people on  to  the\r\n\r\npath  of  destruction. I must stress that  while  the\r\n\r\nnation  is  trying  to educate our  young  people  to\r\n\r\nproduce   more  talented  and  skilled  people,   the\r\n\r\nOpposition are not only unable to help the Government\r\n\r\nin  this respect but they also go out of their way to\r\n\r\nspread  all  sorts of groundless rumours,  using  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  means to mislead those guileless  students\r\n\r\ninto  a  dead alley. This is very wrong of  them.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the incidents in Nantah were only engineered by\r\n\r\na few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncliques  of  misguided youths, but they have  allowed\r\n\r\nthe  students  to  waste their  time  in  meaningless\r\n\r\nactivities. Apart from this, the students  have  also\r\n\r\nwasted their parents' money and effort, and have  let\r\n\r\ndown  the general public. These young people in their\r\n\r\nspeeches  talk  about  their  being  highly  educated\r\n\r\npeople,  that  they are for Chinese  education,  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  preserving Chinese culture and  protecting\r\n\r\nNantah; but if they really understand what they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  at  Nantah,  I believe  these  so-called\r\n\r\nhighly educated people, this so-called group for  the\r\n\r\npreservation  of Chinese culture and education  would\r\n\r\nnot  be willing to wreck their own future. They would\r\n\r\nrealise  that they are being misguided by  the  \r\n\r\nanti-national  elements among whom are some who have  been\r\n\r\nintimidated or misguided. However, the folly of these\r\n\r\nyoung  people  has been encouraged by the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParty  from  the  beginning of  all  this  series  of\r\n\r\nincidents. The Member for Jurong, who can usually  be\r\n\r\nseen  at the university campus or in one of the attap\r\n\r\nhouses  near the university, and who carries out  all\r\n\r\nsorts of activities to preserve the so-called Chinese\r\n\r\nculture,  is regrettably absent in this House  today,\r\n\r\nand is therefore not able to answer my criticisms. Is\r\n\r\nhe  encouraging  the  young people  to  embark  on  a\r\n\r\nsuicidal path?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody will say that the Wang\r\n\r\nGung-Wu Report has anything wrong in it. Some of  the\r\n\r\nstudents  have regarded the Report as an  indictment.\r\n\r\nUniversity  staff also admit that  the  Report  is  a\r\n\r\npraiseworthy  one.  The  anti-national  elements  are\r\n\r\nmaking  use of this Report to justify their  actions.\r\n\r\nBut  sonic  of  our  youths and  students  have  been\r\n\r\nmisguided  by these elements into doing  wrong  acts.\r\n\r\nThey try to explain that the Report is drafted by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to change the nature of the university, to\r\n\r\nanglicise  the  university. Such a poisonous  lie  is\r\n\r\nspreading  like  wild  fire  in  the  campus  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  They tried to incite the  students,  and\r\n\r\neven to resorting to violence to intimidate the staff\r\n\r\nof the university, in order to recover the ground, to\r\n\r\nregain control of the university. But when they found\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversity  authorities  were  adopting  a   rational\r\n\r\nattitude,  hoping that the misguided  students  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  deceived by these elements, they were forced\r\n\r\nto  stage a procession in the university, to  assault\r\n\r\nthe  parents of the students, and wreck the furniture\r\n\r\nof  the  university.  This was  the  performance  and\r\n\r\nbehaviour of these so-called highly educated  people,\r\n\r\nbut  the real directors are the pro-Communists, \r\n\r\nanti-national  elements, who staged this procession.  They\r\n\r\nthought  they  could make use of the  students.  They\r\n\r\nincited the students, turned them into terrorists and\r\n\r\nhooligans,  and  made use of some  stupid  people  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  other students in order to  prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom attending classes. We must praise the Government\r\n\r\nfor  its  firm and swift action in taking  action  in\r\n\r\nconjunction   with  the  university  authorities   to\r\n\r\nrestore  law  and  order  in  the  campus.  The \r\n\r\npro-Communists  tried  to  make use of  the  chauvinistic\r\n\r\nsentiments, but their attempts met with failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell those anti-national and\r\n\r\ncommunalist elements that the destruction  of  public\r\n\r\nfurniture  and assault on the students' parents  will\r\n\r\nnot   go   towards  preserving  Chinese  culture   or\r\n\r\neducation.  If  they continue to  try  to  wreck  our\r\n\r\ninstitute of higher learning, they are bound to fail,\r\n\r\nand  they  will  be  fully responsible  for  all  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their acts. That is why they will not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  face  the democratic  sanction  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They will not be able to deceive the  people\r\n\r\nany  more. They have betrayed the interests of  their\r\n\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is now a part of our higher\r\n\r\neducation system. The Government, in implementing the\r\n\r\npolicy   of  equal  treatment  for  all  streams   of\r\n\r\neducation, has not neglected the existence of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  It  also respects the  autonomy  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.  It  has  spent millions  of  dollars  on\r\n\r\ngrants  to  the  university in  order  to  solve  its\r\n\r\nproblems and to bring about improvements. This  shows\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government has done for the university.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  going to interfere with the internal affairs\r\n\r\nof   any   university.   The   Government   has   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to see that our institutes  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  function properly in educating our people,  and\r\n\r\nnot   turn   them  into  hot-beds  for  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if pro-Communists and communalist\r\n\r\nelements  try to indulge in subversive activities,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Government will take  steps  to  eliminate\r\n\r\nthem.  The  two million people in Singapore  are  \r\n\r\nco-operating  with the Government and are  working  hard\r\n\r\nfor  their  prosperity, and for their  self-reliance.\r\n\r\nThe Government has outlined many policies for \r\n\r\nnation-building.   All   patriotic   people   must   concern\r\n\r\nthemselves with all the speeches and legislative acts\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy speech, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nhas  expressed  the intention that we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a multi-racial society. Such a statement gives\r\n\r\nus encouragement. Our past performance and our future\r\n\r\npolicy  show that in carrying out its social  reform,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is motivated by the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore, the Opposition  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are  trying to spread rumours. Such acts  will\r\n\r\nnot  do  them any good. Their irresponsible  speeches\r\n\r\nwill   not  be  able  to  prevent  the  people   from\r\n\r\nsupporting   the  Government.  All  their   plausible\r\n\r\narguments  will  not influence the people  or  affect\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude  towards the Government.  The  policy\r\n\r\nSpeech  has received the support of the people.  This\r\n\r\nshows  that the anti-national elements are doomed  to\r\n\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to express my full support\r\n\r\nfor  the  Address  of Thanks to the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the  mentality  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  is extremely difficult to fathom.  In  their\r\n\r\npublic manifestos and statements, they talk of  their\r\n\r\ntask to educate and free the people from ignorance so\r\n\r\nthat  they can build a new society over the ruins  of\r\n\r\nthe  old.  And  yet  in practical  life,  with  their\r\n\r\ninconsistent   behaviour  and   their   contradictory\r\n\r\narguments,  they arc confusing the people  more  than\r\n\r\nanyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of August when independence was forced\r\n\r\non us, the Barisan Sosialis Members were the first to\r\n\r\ndemand an emergency sitting of the Assembly to debate\r\n\r\nthe  separation. We told them that there  were  other\r\n\r\nmore  urgent  matters than a debate in the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nOur country must first gain admission into the United\r\n\r\nNations  which  had  a  General Assembly  meeting  in\r\n\r\nSeptember.  Our  Ministers must he there  to  present\r\n\r\ntheir case on behalf of Singapore, otherwise we would\r\n\r\nmiss the occasion. So we had to postpone our Assembly\r\n\r\nsittings in order that the Deputy Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\ntwo  other  Ministers  could proceed  to  the  United\r\n\r\nNations to make an appearance, and then to visit  the\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries to win over their friendship and\r\n\r\nrecognition  for  our new nation. Their  achievements\r\n\r\nhave  been widely publicised in the Press, and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot wish to elaborate on them. There is no doubt that\r\n\r\nwe   have   firmly  established  ourselves   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational  field. So now when the difficult  task\r\n\r\nis  over  and  we  are  ready to  have  our  Assembly\r\n\r\nsittings to conduct a full debate on the independence\r\n\r\nand  the manner in which Singapore was separated from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  we  find the Opposition  Members  missing.\r\n\r\nWhat   kind  of  a  situation  is  this?  They   were\r\n\r\nclamouring  for a sitting, but now when we  let  them\r\n\r\nhave   a   sitting,  they  absent  themselves.   They\r\n\r\ncomplained  that they were not given any  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  air the grievances of the people. They said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Press  used to black out their statements.  They\r\n\r\nsaid  that the radio was controlled by the Government\r\n\r\nand  that there were very few Assembly sittings.  And\r\n\r\nnow  when  we arc having a full-scale debate  on  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government, they refuse to turn  up  to\r\n\r\nfulfil their duties as representatives of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, they denounce the independence of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a phoney independence  and  a  British\r\n\r\nplot.  On the other hand, they formed a committee  of\r\n\r\nthe  relatives of detained persons and  got  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong's  father to sign a  memorandum  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  claiming  that  Singapore,   having\r\n\r\nachieved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependence, must release all the patriots who  were\r\n\r\narrested by the British during the colonial days.  At\r\n\r\nthe  time when the majority of the population  wanted\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia, the Barisan Sosialis said  that\r\n\r\nthey were opposed to merger and Malaysia. They wanted\r\n\r\na self-governing Singapore with control over internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  which  actually amounted to  independence.\r\n\r\nNow that we have got independence, which is what they\r\n\r\noriginally  asked for, they turn round and  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  want independence but  a  merger  with\r\n\r\nMalaya.  They  call  it a \"United Malaya\"  (including\r\n\r\nSingapore). So what kind of a political Party is this\r\n\r\nwhich  is  always  going against the  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people? They claim to he fighters for\r\n\r\nthe  cause  of Chinese education and yet  during  the\r\n\r\nrecent   incidents   in  Nanyang  University,   their\r\n\r\nsupporters  heat  up  the  Vice-Chancellor   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  set fire to the  dormitory  of \r\n\r\nnon-academic   staff.   They  broke  equipment   in   the\r\n\r\nlaboratories. They defaced the wall of the university\r\n\r\nwith   their  ugly  slogans.  They  even  locked   up\r\n\r\nProfessors  in their houses in an attempt to  prevent\r\n\r\nthem  from giving lectures. There was a case in which\r\n\r\na teacher had to call for outside help to release him\r\n\r\nfrom his house because his door was tampered with  by\r\n\r\nstudents  in the night. By these and other  underhand\r\n\r\nmethods,  they were able to carry out their so-called\r\n\r\nboycott  of classes for a few days. They finally  had\r\n\r\nto give up the boycott because public opinion was not\r\n\r\nwith them. But their activities have put shame to the\r\n\r\nname of Chinese education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day before His Excellency opened this\r\n\r\nSession,  the  Barisan leader,  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,\r\n\r\nannounced that they were boycotting the Session.  But\r\n\r\nwhen reporters pointed out to him the danger that his\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  may  lose their seats by  doing  so,  he\r\n\r\nreplied that he had to reconsider the matter. Even  a\r\n\r\nresolute man like him is indecisive! Probably he  has\r\n\r\nto wait for instructions from his underground masters\r\n\r\nor   from   his  comrades  in  the  Malayan  National\r\n\r\nLiberation   League   in   Indonesia,    and    these\r\n\r\ninstructions  are  not yet forthcoming,  because  his\r\n\r\nfriends  in  the  M.N.L.L. are  now  busy  hiding  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia. Such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the indecisive and inconsistent Opposition we are\r\n\r\nfacing  today! They are lost souls. They do not  know\r\n\r\nwhere to go from here, and so the only convenient way\r\n\r\nout  of  this  dilemma for them would  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nabsent from the Assembly. With this tremendous amount\r\n\r\nof  split mentality and inconsistency on their  part,\r\n\r\nit  is small wonder that one of their leaders had  to\r\n\r\ngo  to Woodbridge Hospital to seek special treatment.\r\n\r\nIf  this  trend continues, I am afraid many  of  them\r\n\r\nwill have to follow the lead of their leader and they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to line up at the doorstep of  Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital. If that is the case, then the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  will have to seek more money from this  House\r\n\r\nto provide for more V.I.P. wards to accommodate them.\r\n\r\nThey  said in their statement that they would boycott\r\n\r\nthis  Session  because  they did  not  want  to  lend\r\n\r\ncredence  to  the  so-called phoney independence  and\r\n\r\nhelp the P.A.P. Government to deceive the people. I  do\r\n\r\nnot believe this is the real reason. If that is true,\r\n\r\nthen  why  did  they ask for a silting in  August?  1\r\n\r\nthink  the real reason is that they have lost out  on\r\n\r\nall  fronts.  They have lost in the Referendum.  They\r\n\r\nhave  lost  in the general elections. They have  lost\r\n\r\neven in the Hong Lim by election. They have lost  out\r\n\r\nin  all  open arguments. Furthermore, their Party  is\r\n\r\nsplit,  and  there  is no unity between  their  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  their Party. Even their only hope, that\r\n\r\nthe P.K.I may come and rescue them, vanished with the\r\n\r\ncoup and counter-coup on 30th September in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nin August, the Barisan demanded an emergency sitting.\r\n\r\nToday,  four months later, they have refused to  come\r\n\r\nto the sitting. The only difference between today and\r\n\r\nfour  months ago is that in August the P.K.I. was  at\r\n\r\nthe  peak of its influence in Indonesia. Today it  is\r\n\r\ndown  and out. And their friends in the M.N.L.L. are\r\n\r\nin  hiding.  So  the Barisan decided to  boycott  the\r\n\r\nSession  because they cannot echo the voice of  their\r\n\r\nmasters any more, because the masters are nowhere  to\r\n\r\nhe found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to touch upon the question of survival\r\n\r\nwhich  was  very much emphasised in His  Excellency's\r\n\r\nSpeech. The obstructive forces which work against the\r\n\r\nprogress of our society stem from two sources. First,\r\n\r\nthe Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  our country, and second, the feudalists over  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.  We  sought  to join Malaysia  for  greater\r\n\r\nprosperity  and security, which a small  island  like\r\n\r\nours  would not he able to achieve. But we were  very\r\n\r\nsoon   disillusioned.  Our  big  brothers  over   the\r\n\r\nCauseway  turned  out to be not so brotherly.  During\r\n\r\nthe two years we were in Malaysia, instead of helping\r\n\r\nus  with their vast resources and the potentiality of\r\n\r\ntheir   markets   to   hasten  our  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme, they have looted and plundered -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister should he\r\n\r\nmore careful in the choice of his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> For two years they have taken\r\n\r\naway  40  per cent of our Federal revenues  plus  our\r\n\r\nshare  of the profits in the Currency Board. But  not\r\n\r\none  item of development projects was carried out  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Promises  they had made  before  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwere  never carried out after we had joined Malaysia.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, their promise to let us have  autonomy\r\n\r\nin labour and education. This was solemnly guaranteed\r\n\r\nin  the Malaysian Constitution. But on Ithe slightest\r\n\r\npretext,  they  tried to snatch away  our  autonomous\r\n\r\npower in labour by proclaiming a ban on strikes under\r\n\r\nthe   Emergency  powers,  and  this  was  to  include\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another example. It was agreed before we\r\n\r\njoined  Malaysia that for the Singapore component  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Police  Force,  recruitment,  whether\r\n\r\nMalays or otherwise, must be from Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\nIt  was  only fair because jobs in Singapore must  be\r\n\r\ngiven to Singapore citizens, whether they belonged to\r\n\r\nFederal  departments  or  not.  But  after  we   were\r\n\r\nindependent, we were shocked to learn that of the new\r\n\r\nrecruits in the Singapore Police Force since Malaysia\r\n\r\nDay,  the  majority of them came from the Federation.\r\n\r\nThey  were  using  Singapore as a convenient  dumping\r\n\r\nplace for their unemployed. We are not going to allow\r\n\r\nthem to do this any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a subsequent sitting, I will introduce to this\r\n\r\nHouse a Bill to provide for the issue of work permits\r\n\r\nto  non-citizens. The Member for Bras Basah yesterday\r\n\r\nappealed to the Government to be lenient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  issue of work permits. Well. I  do  wish  we\r\n\r\ncould  be  rich  enough to allow our  neighbours  and\r\n\r\nbrothers across the Causeway to share our prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut Members must realise that our rice bowl is barely\r\n\r\nenough  for our 1.9  million or 2 million population.\r\n\r\nIf  more  people come in to share the rice-bow,  then\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  to our own people will be jeopardised.\r\n\r\nIf  we  allow more and more people to jump  into  our\r\n\r\nsmall  boat,  because  life  in  the  Federation   is\r\n\r\nmiserable, then our small boat may sink and  our  own\r\n\r\nlife  may  start to become as miserable as theirs  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation. What we are now, in fact, telling our\r\n\r\nbrothers  across the Causeway is this.  Do  not  take\r\n\r\nSingapore as your escape route from your present  day\r\n\r\nproblems. That is no solution. If you feel you should\r\n\r\nhave  a  better society and a better Government  like\r\n\r\nSingapore, then you must stay in your own  place  and\r\n\r\nrally  more people to light for such a goal.  If  you\r\n\r\ntry  hard  enough,  then one day  the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\nfeudalistic society will collapse and a more just and\r\n\r\nequal  multi-racial society will  emerge.  Thenn  the\r\n\r\npeople  in the two countries, which are separated  by\r\n\r\nartificial means, will be one again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaysia is determined not to\r\n\r\nallow us to prosper. On this basis, we must seek  our\r\n\r\nown  survival.  We  do  not have  to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nFederation for our living, but we must warn them  not\r\n\r\nto  block  us  from  seeking  our  living  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTrading  with  any  country  of  the  world  is   our\r\n\r\nsovereign right, and I hope the Federation Government\r\n\r\nwill  not interfere in our internal affairs. They  do\r\n\r\nnot want to trade with us, and they deny their market\r\n\r\nto  us.  That is their business. We cannot  complain.\r\n\r\nBut  do  not stop us from carrying out our legitimate\r\n\r\ntrade  with  other countries under any  pretext.  The\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation,   when\r\n\r\ncommenting  on  the  Speech of  our  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  said that lie hoped Singapore would live  on\r\n\r\nher own, with her own way of life, and follow her own\r\n\r\ncourses.
