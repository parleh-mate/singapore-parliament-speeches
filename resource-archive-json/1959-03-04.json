Yesterday, as a result  of  a  bright\r\n\r\nidea  by the Member for Queenstown, he wanted to blot\r\n\r\nout  all election offices during polling day.  I  then\r\n\r\nbrought  up  the  difficulties which candidates  would\r\n\r\nencounter  if  they had no place to  meet.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  then  proposed to resolve the  difficulties,\r\n\r\nand  save  face  all  round by allowing  one  election\r\n\r\noffice. I see no reason why election offices should be\r\n\r\nlimited in this way. It is no more than usual for each\r\n\r\ncandidate  to  maintain one election office  for  each\r\n\r\npolling district or division. The average division has\r\n\r\nabout  four  polling districts, and I do not  see  the\r\n\r\nslightest objection to any candidate maintaining  four\r\n\r\nelection offices or as many election offices as  there\r\n\r\nare in polling divisions. I would therefore suggest to\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister that our considered opinion, before\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown upset the general agreement\r\n\r\non  the  subject, was, and still is, the best opinion,\r\n\r\nand this amendment is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to add to what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said.\r\n\r\nI  would  point  out that particularly  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  which cover a  very  wide  area,  one\r\n\r\noffice  is certainly insufficient for the purpose  and\r\n\r\nit   would  cause  very  great  inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\ncandidates concerned. It might be all right in a  city\r\n\r\nconstituency  where the areas are small and  distances\r\n\r\nare not great. But in the case of rural areas, this is\r\n\r\na  considerable disadvantage to the candidate and this\r\n\r\namendment  does not meet the point at  all.  It  could\r\n\r\npossibly be all right if we altered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  amendment to \"an office or offices\", but  as  it\r\n\r\nstands  I do not think it would be acceptable to  this\r\n\r\nside of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I appreciate the point\r\n\r\nraised by the hon.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has indicated that it proposes  to  have  a\r\n\r\npublic holiday declared by His Excellency the Governor,\r\n\r\nexercising   his   power  under  the  Public   Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance. However that may be, Sir, we must  remember\r\n\r\nthat  this  piece of legislation which we  are  pushing\r\n\r\nthrough  this  House  is not only valid  for  this  one\r\n\r\ngeneral election but also subsequent general elections.\r\n\r\nUnless  we  have  a proviso in the Elections  Ordinance\r\n\r\nthat  polling  day  shall be a public  holiday,  it  is\r\n\r\nalways open to a subsequent Government without breaking\r\n\r\nan undertaking, because none would have been given, not\r\n\r\nto  have  a  public holiday on polling day. I therefore\r\n\r\npropose to move this amendment to include, after clause\r\n\r\n14, the proviso ensuring that polling day shall, in any\r\n\r\ngeneral election, either the one we all expect  in  May\r\n\r\nor any other subsequent ones, automatically be a public\r\n\r\nholiday. Sir, I move, \"That the clause be read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I\r\n\r\ncorrect in commenting on this clause? When the Bill was\r\n\r\nmoved  for the Second Reading I emphasised that polling\r\n\r\nday should be a public holiday. In the past many shops,\r\n\r\ndepartment  stores and business houses  remained  open,\r\n\r\nand  it was most difficult for employees to get out and\r\n\r\nvote.  The argument now is that the employers  will  be\r\n\r\nforced to allow their employees to go and vote.  But  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think that is quite sufficient in the  present\r\n\r\ndangerous   state  of  Singapore  under   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Sir, we have to think of females  who  are\r\n\r\ncompelled to vote when their breadwinners are in  their\r\n\r\noffices working. Grown-up daughters and beautiful wives\r\n\r\nwill find it difficult to go out and vote by themselves\r\n\r\nwithout  an  escort. The thing is this. If there  is  a\r\n\r\npublic  holiday it will be easier for the  female  folk\r\n\r\nand  the weak to get assistance from their men folk who\r\n\r\ncould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccompany  them to go and do their duty in, this  very\r\n\r\nimportant election, when this Government must get  out\r\n\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, at last the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has got\r\n\r\nme to my feet. The form of this new clause that he has\r\n\r\nproposed  I have agreed. But he knows full  well  that\r\n\r\nwhat  I have agreed is only the form. I have told  him\r\n\r\nthat if a new clause in this form is put into the  law\r\n\r\nit  will do what he wants it to do. But I dislike this\r\n\r\nnew clause for two reasons. First, it is, at least for\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming general election, quite  unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAn undertaking has been given that polling day will be\r\n\r\ndeclared  a  holiday,  and secondly,  I  dislike  this\r\n\r\ndevice   of  seeking  to  amend  a  not  uncomplicated\r\n\r\nHolidays  Ordinance  by putting  something  into  this\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance. If the hon. Member were satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  arrangements that will  be  made  for  this\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  but fearful  of  what  some  future\r\n\r\nGovernment may do, he should, in my view, introduce  a\r\n\r\nBill to amend the Holidays Ordinance, and not seek  to\r\n\r\namend  the Holidays Ordinance by the by-blow  of  some\r\n\r\nnot  immediately essential or desirable  amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  Elections Ordinance. It seems to me that we shall\r\n\r\nonly  be  storing  up trouble for  the  future  if  we\r\n\r\npersist  in  altering  the law  haphazardly  by  these\r\n\r\ncurious cross-references which in practice will, I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure,  be  liable to be  overlooked  and  cause\r\n\r\nendless trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to\r\n\r\nhave  got the Attorney-General to his feet to meet  my\r\n\r\nargument,  but  I think he can at least  see  that  an\r\n\r\namendment  is necessary if subsequent Governments  are\r\n\r\nto  be  bound.  We can always accept his  Government's\r\n\r\nundertaking, but no subsequent Government has yet come\r\n\r\nabout  nor  given an undertaking. It may believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  proper form to maintain legislative elegance  and\r\n\r\nneatness is to amend the Holidays Ordinance, but  also\r\n\r\nhe  knows  that, if a private Member moves a  Bill  to\r\n\r\namend  the  Ordinance, it must automatically  go  into\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.

There is no time for any  Member\r\n\r\nto move a private Bill. In view of the coming election\r\n\r\nand  in view of my suggestion to give escort to female\r\n\r\nvoters, it is very essential that, as a special  thing\r\n\r\nfor  this  election, we pass this Bill in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the public.

This is a matter in which I  have  to\r\n\r\nrely on the advice of the Attorney General. He advises\r\n\r\nme  that that is not the proper way to achieve it. And\r\n\r\nnow,  I  hear  from the hon.

There are,  however,\r\n\r\nthree items on which I propose to make some additional\r\n\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first refers to the proposed appointments of\r\n\r\ninterpreters for the Legislative Assembly in order  to\r\n\r\nimplement   the   proposal  that   all   debates   and\r\n\r\ndiscussions in the Assembly will be conducted  in  the\r\n\r\nfour  languages, namely English, Malay,  Mandarin  and\r\n\r\nTamil, under the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will recollect that, in this connection,\r\n\r\na  Select Committee was appointed and made its  Report\r\n\r\non  the  matter in 1957, which has been  published  as\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper No. L.A. 20 of 1957. It is imperative\r\n\r\nthat  early  arrangements  should  be  made  for   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  and  training of these  interpreters,  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  trained  staff will be  available  to  render\r\n\r\nsimultaneous  interpretation in the four languages  at\r\n\r\nthe first sitting of the new Assembly. It is therefore\r\n\r\nproposed  to implement immediately the recommendations\r\n\r\nin  sub-paragraphs (7) to (10) of paragraph 35 of  the\r\n\r\nReport,    namely    to   recruit   three    permanent\r\n\r\ninterpreters - one  in  English and  Malay,  another  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  Mandarin, and the third in  English  and\r\n\r\nTamil - and  six part-time interpreters, two  proficient\r\n\r\nin English and Malay, two in English and Mandarin, and\r\n\r\ntwo in English and Tamil, and that Mr A. T. Pilley of\r\n\r\nthe   Linguists  Club,  London,  an  expert   in   the\r\n\r\norganisation and training of simultaneous oral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstructions/translation   personnel   and   who   was\r\n\r\npreviously  consulted  by  the  Select  Committee,  be\r\n\r\nengaged  for  a  period of at least 10  days  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose   of  testing,  selecting  and  training   the\r\n\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concerns the provision of bursaries for\r\n\r\nMalay students in the secondary schools. The object of\r\n\r\nthe  proposal is to enable the Malay students who  are\r\n\r\nin  needy  circumstances to complete  their  secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  The  bursary will  be  awarded  where  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  circumstances of a deserving student  would\r\n\r\nprevent  him  from obtaining secondary education.  The\r\n\r\naward  will  be  confined to Malay  students  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or children of Singapore citizens  resident\r\n\r\nfor  not  less  than  five  years,  prior  to  joining\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. The value of the bursary  would  be\r\n\r\n$72  per  annum  and, on the basis of  250  bursaries,\r\n\r\nsupplementary provision of $18,000 will  be  required.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, school fees will be remitted and the sum\r\n\r\nof $10,080 will be involved in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third refers to the provision of a loan scheme\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  overseas private  students  to  assist\r\n\r\nproven  needy  cases. Assistance will be  confined  to\r\n\r\nstudents who have passed at least their preliminary or\r\n\r\nintermediate  examination, and are making satisfactory\r\n\r\nprogress   in   the   course  of  study   leading   to\r\n\r\nqualifications for which there is still an unsatisfied\r\n\r\ndemand in Government, and to prove their inability  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  studies without Government  assistance.  Any\r\n\r\napplicant  who receives assistance must  undertake  to\r\n\r\napply  for  appointment in Government  service  for  a\r\n\r\nspecified  period. Two sureties will be  required  and\r\n\r\nthe  loan,  which is interest-free, would be repayable\r\n\r\nover  a  period after the students have qualified  and\r\n\r\nbegun  gainful  employment.  It  is  hoped  that  this\r\n\r\nproposal  will  tide  over the  shortage  of  suitably\r\n\r\nqualified  professional men at the  present  stage  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation. Only $20,000 will be required for each\r\n\r\nyear  and  it  is  proposed to  put  the  scheme  into\r\n\r\noperation for five years, or until the demand for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe requisite qualifications has been met.

This Bill is\r\n\r\ndrafted by the legal advisers of Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwhich is essentially a private organisation. But the\r\n\r\nGovernment has seen fit to handle this matter because\r\n\r\nthe provision of higher education in Chinese is of\r\n\r\npublic concern. Very few substantial changes have been\r\n\r\nmade in the Bill as the result of the deliberations of\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee, because it is not the intention\r\n\r\nto make material changes to the proposals submitted by\r\n\r\nthe sponsors of this private institution. I will deal\r\n\r\nwith these changes which we have introduced into the\r\n\r\nBill at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only say at this stage that there is the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  Commission  consisting  of   five\r\n\r\neminent scholars who are extremely interested  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  Nanyang  University.  They  are  making  a\r\n\r\nspecial   study   of  the  constitution   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. Members of the House can therefore  expect\r\n\r\nthat  when  the Commission has completed its findings,\r\n\r\nthere might be further changes to be introduced to the\r\n\r\nUniversity.   Of   course,  those  changes   will   be\r\n\r\nconsidered   jointly   by  the  Government   and   the\r\n\r\nUniversity Authority when they are submitted,  because\r\n\r\nthe Commission was jointly appointed by the Government\r\n\r\nand  the  University.  But  the  matter  of  immediate\r\n\r\nimportance   now   is   to  have  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nincorporated  by  law  so that the  administration  of\r\n\r\nNanyang University can be put on a better footing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the changes which the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  have  introduced  into  the  Bill.  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned   that   the  changes  are   few   and   not\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  I  refer  in  particular,  Sir,  to  the\r\n\r\naddition  of  a  new clause 26 in  the  Bill  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose   of   establishing  the  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union, the constitution of which should  be\r\n\r\napproved by the Council of the University or  by  such\r\n\r\nauthority  as  may be authorised for that  purpose  by\r\n\r\nstatute. The clause also gives power to the Council\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  delegate to the Union, on such conditions as it may\r\n\r\nthink fit to enforce, the management of any building or\r\n\r\ncommon room assigned for the use of students. The House\r\n\r\nwill  remember that at one of the previous sittings  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, when the Minister moved the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill,  he  stated  that  he  would  see  that\r\n\r\nprovision would be made in the Bill to give the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Students' Union a status, and that  is  what\r\n\r\nhas been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the addition of a new sub-paragraph (3)\r\n\r\nto  paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to provide  that\r\n\r\nnotice   of  every  meeting  of  the  members  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity,  stating the business to be  considered  at\r\n\r\nthe  meeting, should be sent by post to each member  of\r\n\r\nthe University at least seven days before such meeting,\r\n\r\nunless  special  circumstances require shorter  notice.\r\n\r\nBut  the  proceedings  of any  meeting  should  not  be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvalidated  by  any irregularity in  respect  of  such\r\n\r\nnotice.

I  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a certain amount of concern over the  welfare\r\n\r\nand  well-being of the public service as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nexpected  political  changes. I would  like  to  remind\r\n\r\nthem, first, that it is their duty as civil servants to\r\n\r\nbe  politically neutral in carrying out the  orders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in power, and that they enjoy a special\r\n\r\nposition  under the new constitution with  their  basic\r\n\r\nsalaries  guaranteed; but that corresponding  to  these\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions  for their benefit,  they  have  to\r\n\r\nshoulder special responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to read what I stated last Sunday\r\n\r\nwith  regard to our policy on labour and trade  unions.\r\n\r\nWe have a special provision entitled \"Special Duties of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Service\" which I stated  on  behalf  of  my\r\n\r\nParty:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At this point, we would like to emphasise the special\r\n\r\nduties of workers in the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  like the Government, the Government agencies,\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Telephone  Board  and  semi-Government\r\n\r\nagencies like the Singapore Improvement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the right to a fair wage and good\r\n\r\nconditions  of  employment,  holidays,  leave,  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits and good terms for retirement. We support  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of collective bargaining between  unions  of\r\n\r\nworkers in these categories and the Government or these\r\n\r\nstatutory  Boards, but we expect and will enforce  high\r\n\r\nstandards  of  service and courtesy to the  public  and\r\n\r\nequally high standards of efficiency and discipline  in\r\n\r\nthese services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of the P.A.P. Government after it\r\n\r\nhas been elected by the people into office to implement\r\n\r\nits policy and no civil servant has the right to oppose\r\n\r\nor block or hinder our policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these few special observations, a P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will treat its workers and the unions  as  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood employer and as the people's trustees.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result of the deliberate\r\n\r\ndistortion  and  propaganda carried on by  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage  Press for the specific purpose of  trying  to\r\n\r\ndemoralise our English-speaking supporters, the  public\r\n\r\nservice thinks, rightly or wrongly, that the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nagainst   them  because  they,  being  members   of   a\r\n\r\nprivileged class, will be destroyed in a non-privileged\r\n\r\nsociety. I would like to remind the civil service  that\r\n\r\nit  is our duty, if and when we form the Government, to\r\n\r\nabide by the rules of the game, and the rules are  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,\r\n\r\n1958,  which safeguards their basic interests. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  this: that their interests  having  been\r\n\r\nsafeguarded,  it is their duty to exert  themselves  to\r\n\r\nthe best of their ability on behalf of the people whose\r\n\r\ntaxes  help  to pay their emoluments and  ensure  their\r\n\r\npeaceful and happy retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I asked a question to which I received a\r\n\r\nreply which was silent on several matters. My motion is\r\n\r\nin  general terms, and I am asking this House  to  join\r\n\r\nwith  me  in  stating something which is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  policy. It is my view that any Malayan officer\r\n\r\nwho  has accepted promotion as a Malayan on account  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayanisation scheme is automatically disentitled,\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the   special\r\n\r\nprovisions that are written into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  abolition terms can say to the contrary. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  if  there  are any other members of  the  public\r\n\r\nservice who hope to follow the example of this  august\r\n\r\nofficial who will retire with a sum of money the total\r\n\r\nof  which we have not been informed, but I would  like\r\n\r\nto state here and now that nobody has the right, if he\r\n\r\nhas  accepted  promotion on account of Malayanisation,\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"Ah, but I am really not a Malayan. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  compensation  like the  white  man.\"  The  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary said yesterday, in regard to this particular\r\n\r\nofficer, that he made representations to the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State  in  1957 - he did not say at what  particular\r\n\r\ntime in 1957 - under section 18 of Ordinance No. 43  of\r\n\r\n1956. The Chief Secretary said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Secretary of State after considering these\r\n\r\nrepresentations  expressed himself satisfied  that  he\r\n\r\nhad  reasonable  grounds  for  anxiety  regarding  the\r\n\r\nfuture of his career in the public service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  would  like to know from the Chief Secretary  when\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of  State expressed himself  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  this officer had reasonable grounds for anxiety.\r\n\r\nI  would  also like to know what advice the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  tendered  to the  Secretary  of  State  in\r\n\r\nregard  to this particular application. When  I  first\r\n\r\ncame to know that moves were being made to retire this\r\n\r\nofficer,  I warned the Chief Minister that this  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  issue and not just a civil service  matter.\r\n\r\nWhen  an officer gets promotion and then says,  \"I  am\r\n\r\ngoing to scoot with a bagful of notes\" - it is the duty\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to prevent that from happening.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to know from the Chief Minister what advice  his\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers tendered to  the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState,  for  the Secretary of State does  not  act  on\r\n\r\nthese matters without advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary went on to say that the officer,\r\n\r\nhaving  become entitled, gave five months'  notice  in\r\n\r\nNovember 1958 of his intention to retire under section\r\n\r\n3 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know these facts. What is the\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  be in terms of dollars?  What  would\r\n\r\nhave  been the position of the officer had there  been\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalayanisation scheme? When in 1957 did he apply to be\r\n\r\nentitled? When was he advised that he was entitled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a country moves from a state of tutelage\r\n\r\nand   dependence  towards  independence,  it  is   the\r\n\r\npractice  in British territories to allow their  civil\r\n\r\nservants  to quit the service and enter the  political\r\n\r\narena. It is a legal and open recognition of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat,  in  a colonial territory, the civil service  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily neutral. Two officers opted to retire\r\n\r\nand  enter  the political arena. They were  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to take part in politics. They were  given\r\n\r\nno  compensation terms. They will be candidates at the\r\n\r\nnext  elections. If this officer felt that at the next\r\n\r\nelections  a  government will come  into  power  which\r\n\r\nwould  give him grounds for anxiety as to his  future,\r\n\r\nit was quite open to him to opt out of the service and\r\n\r\ncontest  the  elections against  the  Party  which  he\r\n\r\ndislikes,  or  which  he thinks will  be  against  his\r\n\r\ninterests. But for him as the Head of the Intelligence\r\n\r\norganisation of the Government, to scoot with a bagful\r\n\r\nof notes is the most deplorable episode ever recounted\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the world. A man who was entrusted  with\r\n\r\nthe   whole   business  of  Intelligence   and   anti-subversion, turns out to be not a great idealist and a\r\n\r\nman  of  convictions and ability to match his  duties,\r\n\r\nbut a lout who only wanted to further his own ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a tribute to my Party, if what the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  said was true, that he quit because he expected\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  come in. I will  say  this,  that  no\r\n\r\nofficer  will be penalised in the service  for  having\r\n\r\ncarried out his orders, whether they be for or against\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the P.A.P., because we expect the civil\r\n\r\nservice to carry out orders. Therefore, we acknowledge\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they must carry out the orders  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  or  any future  Government  which\r\n\r\nfollows  the  P.A.P.  In the case of  this  particular\r\n\r\nofficer, his position is especially entrenched in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   (Constitution)  Order  in   Council.   The\r\n\r\nposition  of  the Commissioner of Police,  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police and the Director of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch  receives  special  mention   in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  on  what grounds the officer can conceivably  be\r\n\r\nanxious  when his position is already a built-in  one.\r\n\r\nAll  I can say is that either he must have done a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreacherous   act  which  he  was  afraid   would   be\r\n\r\nsubsequently  discovered, or that he was a  despicable\r\n\r\nmercenary, and it was a deliberate and calculated plan\r\n\r\nto  go  twice  at  public expense to England,  qualify\r\n\r\nhimself  as  a  barrister-at-law, and then  give  five\r\n\r\nmonths' notice of his intention to retire on full  pay\r\n\r\nat  public expense, while he sits in Chambers  waiting\r\n\r\nto  be admitted to practise at the Bar and rake in the\r\n\r\nshekels.  Sir, I notice that he is prudent  enough  to\r\n\r\nmake   sure  of  collecting  his  compensation  terms,\r\n\r\nbecause,  if  I  read  the  Chief  Secretary's   reply\r\n\r\nyesterday  correctly, his retirement will be effective\r\n\r\nfrom next month, that is before the elections. But, as\r\n\r\nI  told the Chief Minister, this is a political issue.\r\n\r\nNo officer is entitled to do this. It is our view that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  man  should  be made to refund  the  $20,000  or\r\n\r\n$30,000  or  $40,000 that was spent on him on  several\r\n\r\ntrips  to Britain. On the first trip that he went  for\r\n\r\nspecial training as a policeman in order to equip  him\r\n\r\nfor his special duties, he enrolled as a member of the\r\n\r\nBar.  He  is an able officer in his particular  field,\r\n\r\nand  nobody objects to a police officer acquiring some\r\n\r\nlegal  knowledge.  Subsequently, he wangled  a  return\r\n\r\ntrip  during which he completed his studies.  He  then\r\n\r\ncame  back, took full advantage of the fact that there\r\n\r\nwas  Malayanisation and that vacancies were two for  a\r\n\r\npenny right at the top, and got himself ensconced in a\r\n\r\nconvenient job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing against Mr Khaw. I am only sorry\r\n\r\nthat he did a disservice to the whole police force and\r\n\r\nto  the  whole of the public service by  what  he  has\r\n\r\ndone.  My Party has every intention of resisting  this\r\n\r\nofficer  in  his  scheme  to get  about  $100,000  for\r\n\r\ncompensation.  I would like to add this  in  case  any\r\n\r\nother officer thinks of opting out of the service in a\r\n\r\nsimilar way, that it is the business of the Government\r\n\r\nto  prevent this. I do not believe that there  can  be\r\n\r\nany other such mercenary in the service. For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose who stay behind to serve the next Government,  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  a  Government which  will  play  strictly\r\n\r\naccording  to the rules, which states what it  intends\r\n\r\nto  do,  and  will  do  what it has  stated.  We  have\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered  the  position  of  the   public\r\n\r\nservice.  We  are  party to the  provisions  regarding\r\n\r\ntheir  future, and we shall abide by those rules.  But\r\n\r\nwe   expect   and  will  enforce  high  standards   of\r\n\r\nefficiency, discipline and loyalty to the service, and\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that they will rise to the special and\r\n\r\nheavier  responsibilities that  will  fall  upon  them\r\n\r\nafter  the  next general elections. But just  in  case\r\n\r\nthere  happens to be some other adventurer wanting  to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  of a weak and vacillating  Government\r\n\r\ngiving  the  wrong kind of advice to the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState,  I ask the House formally today to join  me  in\r\n\r\nsaying  that  we deplore the payment of Malayanisation\r\n\r\ncompensation terms to any Malayan officer who had been\r\n\r\ngiven  and  had  accepted  promotion  on  account   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.

But  I  ask  the  civil   service,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the higher strata,  to  remember\r\n\r\nthat  their  future, and the future  of  the  country,\r\n\r\ndepends  upon high standards of integrity and  service\r\n\r\nto  the  people. That these Malayanisation  terms  and\r\n\r\nschemes  are  avenues for them to serve  their  people\r\n\r\nbetter,  and  that we expect them so to  approach  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is ridiculous that Government should\r\n\r\nembark  on a policy whereby a local officer  not  only\r\n\r\ngains  accelerated  promotion  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  policy, but also  that  he  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to retire from the public service after having\r\n\r\naccepted  promotion  with compensation  on  the  terms\r\n\r\napproved for expatriate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in carrying out the Malayanisation policy,\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers  have  to  make  room  for  local\r\n\r\nofficers, and it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor this reason that they receive compensation for loss\r\n\r\nof  employment. Does the Government not realise that it\r\n\r\nis acting foolishly, as well as perpetrating a fraud on\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers, when it agrees to allow a local officer\r\n\r\nwho has been promoted to a job vacated by an expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer to leave his job and to receive the same amount\r\n\r\nof  compensation which has been paid to the  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer, with the object of making the job available to\r\n\r\nthe local officer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a local officer has accepted promotion and has\r\n\r\nbeen promoted as a result of the Malayanisation policy,\r\n\r\nhe  should surely never be allowed to pretend that  his\r\n\r\nappointment  will  no longer be safe  for  him  with  a\r\n\r\nchange  of  government, and that  after  having  gained\r\n\r\nearly promotion, he should then be allowed to leave his\r\n\r\njob  on  lavish  compensation terms. Sir,  if  a  local\r\n\r\nofficer  in  the restricted class wishes to retire  for\r\n\r\npolitical  reasons, he had the opportunity of declaring\r\n\r\nhis intention some time ago. In this case, Sir, he will\r\n\r\nleave  the service on his usual pension terms and  will\r\n\r\nnot be compensated for loss of employment; but the case\r\n\r\nto  which I am referring cannot be so compared. In that\r\n\r\ncase, a local officer has been paid compensation  on  a\r\n\r\nvery lavish scale for loss of employment on vacating  a\r\n\r\npost which he was never required to leave and which  it\r\n\r\nwas his duty not to relinquish at a time when important\r\n\r\nconstitutional changes are to take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the officer concerned has been allowed to leave\r\n\r\nthe service and is now practising at the local Bar.  He\r\n\r\nhas been paid compensation far above what he would ever\r\n\r\nhave received on normal retirement after having enjoyed\r\n\r\nthe  higher emoluments of the post which he would never\r\n\r\nhave reached were it not for the Malayanisation policy.\r\n\r\nI consider this action of Government to be indefensible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand deplorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> It seems to me, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the ex-Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFront  Government, now the S.P.A. Coalition Government,\r\n\r\nhas   bungled   everything  in  its  management.   Sir,\r\n\r\nmemories,  especially in Singapore, are very short.  In\r\n\r\n1952,  the  Legislative Council, in order to  help  the\r\n\r\nlocal-born boys to rise to higher positions and to take\r\n\r\nover  high  posts from the expatriates, got a Committee\r\n\r\nappointed  through  me,  the Ad-hoc  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council, with Mr L. C. Goh as  Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe  Report  of the Committee was ultimately presented,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  it recommended that local-born officers should  go\r\n\r\nup  to  the top and take over from the expatriates  the\r\n\r\nright  to run the administration of this Colony. Later,\r\n\r\nthe  Malayanisation scheme with compensation terms  for\r\n\r\nthe  abolition of the expatriates came into being. What\r\n\r\nwas  meant by that scheme? The spirit of it is that  if\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  take  over as early as possible  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of our local-born boys, we must give favourable\r\n\r\nterms   to  the  expatriates - white  or  black,  it   is\r\n\r\nimmaterial - so that they can strike this big lottery and\r\n\r\nretire to their homes. Well, all this is past now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any democratic country democracy can rule only\r\n\r\nif the local men, forming the public civil service, are\r\n\r\nloyal  to their own country. If any local-born  officer\r\n\r\ntakes   advantage  of  the  Malayanisation  scheme   by\r\n\r\nretiring with compensation, and that was not meant  for\r\n\r\nsuch people at all, and the Government has allowed  him\r\n\r\nto  so  retire, then that is wrong in principle. He  is\r\n\r\nnot  retiring  to any other country as  he  is  not  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate; and if he is not an expatriate, why  should\r\n\r\nthis  huge sum then be paid to him? Sir, I do not  know\r\n\r\nthis  officer in question. I do not know anything about\r\n\r\nhis  case, and I am only talking on principle - that  our\r\n\r\nlocal  boys, trained at the expense of public  revenue,\r\n\r\nshould give loyal service and stick fast to their jobs.\r\n\r\nThen only can we gain independence; not otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what has happened in this case, and\r\n\r\nwhile  awaiting the reply of the Government, I wish  to\r\n\r\nstress   this  principle - that  no  local-born  officer,\r\n\r\ntrained  at  the expense of public revenue,  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven the advantage of compensation terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink it is quite obvious that whoever this officer\r\n\r\nmay be, he is not a member of the P.A.P., and perhaps\r\n\r\nhe does not like the P.A.P. He may even fear the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., Sir! He may feel that he should not allow\r\n\r\nhimself to be made a \"Marcus\"! Sir, if this particular\r\n\r\nofficer, according to the existing law today, is\r\n\r\nentitled to retire and is entitled to the compensation\r\n\r\nwhich he has been paid or will be paid, where then is\r\n\r\nthe kick? It may be that he is not sporting. But if he\r\n\r\nhas fear that the future treatment which he might\r\n\r\nreceive may not be fair, then why should he not have\r\n\r\nthe right to retire and receive compensation if the\r\n\r\nlaw so allows him? Sir, bad law is considered better\r\n\r\nthan no law at all. If the law is bad, it has to be\r\n\r\nchanged; and until that law is changed, every person\r\n\r\nworking under that bad law, has his legal rights to\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not defending this man; I do not know him\r\n\r\nwell.  But it is unfair to attack him as he cannot  be\r\n\r\nhere to defend himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to Malayanisation, Sir, In 1924 I fought for\r\n\r\nbetter terms of service for local officers. I was then\r\n\r\nemployed as a teacher. My maximum salary was $300, and\r\n\r\nit  could not get beyond that. A European coming  from\r\n\r\nEngland  started with $400. In 1924, Sir, I  fought  a\r\n\r\nlosing battle. There was no chance. Today we have  our\r\n\r\nchance. We have fought and won Malayanisation by which\r\n\r\nwe  have  got rid of all expatriate officers,  and  by\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are giving our local boys a chance  to  get\r\n\r\nbetter   terms  in  Government  service.  Sir,   their\r\n\r\nsalaries    must    be   commensurate    with    their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  be  equal  to  those  offered  by\r\n\r\ncommercial firms, otherwise we will not get  the  best\r\n\r\nmen  in  the civil service. If commercial firms  offer\r\n\r\nhigher salaries than what the Government can offer  to\r\n\r\nits  civil servants, Sir, I shall feel very sorry  for\r\n\r\nthe class of civil servants we shall have in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nhon. Mr R. C. H. Lim referred to the year 1924. I\r\n\r\nremember coming out here myself as a young teacher in\r\n\r\n1934 - ten years later. There was a senior Chinese\r\n\r\nteacher on the staff who was, so I thought, in charge\r\n\r\nof me and he told me what to do, and kept an eye on\r\n\r\nme. I called him \"Sir\" until I was sent for by the\r\n\r\nprincipal who said that this senior teacher had been\r\n\r\nto see him, and would I stop calling him \"Sir\",\r\n\r\nbecause that embarrassed him. I then looked into the\r\n\r\nmatter - it had not occurred to me before - and found that\r\n\r\nthis man was longer in service than I, and was getting\r\n\r\n$300 a month; and that I with about six weeks'\r\n\r\nservice, was getting $400. That was my first shock at\r\n\r\nthe irrationality of the way things were done in\r\n\r\nSingapore some time ago. I thought then of the\r\n\r\nimportance of giving proper treatment to all officers,\r\n\r\nand I did not feel it was fair, speaking for myself,\r\n\r\nthat I should start at a scale higher than that of a\r\n\r\nman of long experience. I have in the course of nearly\r\n\r\n25 years of life here seen the extreme value of the\r\n\r\nwork of the long service officers, who have come up\r\n\r\nthe hard way in all departments of the civil service,\r\n\r\nand who, in addition to basic qualifications, have\r\n\r\nacquired the practical administrative experience which\r\n\r\nis of vital importance, without which mere intellect\r\n\r\nand scholastic achievements can make most serious\r\n\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was reading, Mr Speaker, a very\r\n\r\ninteresting   book  by  a  Mr  Tarzie   Vittachi,   a\r\n\r\nCeylonese.  It is called \"Emergency 1958\"  and  in  it\r\n\r\nthis  journalist of a most responsible Ceylonese paper\r\n\r\ndescribed how, in May 1958, they arrived at a state of\r\n\r\ncommunal riots, deaths, murders. He described them  in\r\n\r\nsome  detail. For example, how a gang of  rioters  set\r\n\r\nfire  to a sugar-cane plantation in which people  were\r\n\r\nhiding,  and  the flames thus drove the hidden  people\r\n\r\nout;  when  they  were set upon  and  beaten  up,  and\r\n\r\npregnant  women  had their stomachs ripped  open,  and\r\n\r\nbled to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeath.  That  was  the  sort of situation  which  they\r\n\r\narrived  at  in Ceylon. His book is banned  there;  he\r\n\r\nhimself is not allowed to live there apparently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it sounded to me convincing. I was in Ceylon a\r\n\r\nyear  previously  and it seemed to me  something  like\r\n\r\nthat  was  on its way. I recollect also that when  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front Government took office in 1955,  it  was\r\n\r\nnot  long  before  we had rioting in  the  streets.  I\r\n\r\nrecollect then that the experienced Governor we had at\r\n\r\nthat time warned us that rioting and death were on the\r\n\r\nway,  and he was right. These things can happen,  they\r\n\r\ncan  happen  in Singapore, and they have  happened  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent  in Singapore. And the safeguard  against\r\n\r\nthem  is,  very largely, the experience, the practical\r\n\r\nwisdom  of  the  senior civil servants in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice;  whether it is the Government public service,\r\n\r\nor  the  City  Council, or the  Rural  Board,  or  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T., or the Telephone Board, or the Harbour  Board,\r\n\r\nor  any  of  the other quasi-governmental  bodies,  we\r\n\r\nalways come back to the same problem that somebody has\r\n\r\ngot to know the answers from experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

There has been a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nanxiety  expressed  in  getting around  the  political\r\n\r\nreasons in the last few weeks. I have heard a  lot  of\r\n\r\nanxiety. A lot of it is artificially engendered in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  but nevertheless there is that  in  the  air\r\n\r\nbecause,   throughout  many  territories   where   new\r\n\r\ngovernments have come in, there have been difficulties\r\n\r\nfor  civil servants. I would like specifically to say,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, that I do not think this anxiety,  which\r\n\r\nsome  people feel, arises only from P.A.P. activities.\r\n\r\nI  have  risen  frequently before  in  this  House  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpress my disagreement and disapproval of the  things\r\n\r\nthat  have been said in this House, the sort of things\r\n\r\nwhich  inevitably damage the confidence of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice in the good sense of politicians, the sort  of\r\n\r\nthings that have been said from this side of the House\r\n\r\nvery frequently as well as from the other. It is not a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  one Party or another; it is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\npeople  coming rather new to administration.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to start again on that one, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was myself a politician without any\r\n\r\nexperience, except as a schoolmaster, I was pulled out\r\n\r\nby  the  former Chief Minister and made  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works. I came into my Ministry with\r\n\r\na  profound belief that, on the whole, I should find a\r\n\r\nlot  of things wrong and that with my piercing mind  I\r\n\r\nshould be able to put them all right. I said obviously\r\n\r\nthis  ought to have been done, and if it had not  been\r\n\r\ndone somebody was very much to blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  as  I went about my work I discovered, of course,\r\n\r\nthat  certain things ought to have been done, and what\r\n\r\nwas  possible was being done, but we could not do more\r\n\r\nthan  was  possible.  The former Chief  Minister,  Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall, used to have a telephone on his desk at  the\r\n\r\n\"Meet  the  People\"  sessions, and  telephoned  senior\r\n\r\nofficers.   That,   I  am  sure,   induced   in   them\r\n\r\nconsiderable anxiety about their future, because  they\r\n\r\nare  dealing with important work. They got a telephone\r\n\r\nmessage  from  the Chief Minister based on  inaccurate\r\n\r\ninformation  given  by a man dealing  with  a  special\r\n\r\ncase,  and  they  got  instructions  to  do  or   undo\r\n\r\nsomething  on which no proper consideration  had  been\r\n\r\ngiven.  That  was  the thing that  would  cause  great\r\n\r\nanxiety  to any officer who is seriously concerned  in\r\n\r\ngetting his work done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really speak, Mr Speaker, rather on the edge of\r\n\r\nthe  motion  to  the  effect that  even  if,  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular case, the officer concerned is actually  in\r\n\r\na degree of anxiety which is unnecessary and has taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of his legal position to the extent which is\r\n\r\nundesirable, it should not induce any of us  to  think\r\n\r\nthat  that is widespread throughout the civil service.\r\n\r\nI  know  myself  of  senior  civil  servants  who  had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresisted the most tempting offers of posts to go  into\r\n\r\nprivate  life. The rates of pay in government  service\r\n\r\nare  not  equivalent to what a man  can  earn  in  the\r\n\r\ncommercial world, and in carrying on the senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants  are making real sacrifices, and they  should\r\n\r\nbe remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can finish with one of my favourite authors, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Confucius,  in  the  English   translation,\r\n\r\nremarks  that  \"an  accomplished  scholar  is  not   a\r\n\r\nutensil\". A senior civil servant is not a tool; he  is\r\n\r\na  person; and so is a junior civil servant; so is the\r\n\r\nman  who  cleans the drains; they have their feelings;\r\n\r\nthey  have their impulses; these have to be  borne  in\r\n\r\nmind.  The  idea  of the mechanical civil  service  is\r\n\r\nunreal.  Certainly the civil service  must  carry  out\r\n\r\norders,  just as much as a soldier carries out orders.\r\n\r\nWe  have had War Crimes trials after the Japanese  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Nazis had been beaten, and we have seen there how\r\n\r\nsome  people did carry out orders, and how the  orders\r\n\r\nwere held to be invalid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  they were contrary to public morality.

In  so  far  as  the  particular\r\n\r\nmatters under discussion concern the personal act  and\r\n\r\ndecision  of a public officer, it is not a  matter  in\r\n\r\nwhich    the    Minister    concerned    can    accept\r\n\r\nresponsibility. It follows that the discussion in this\r\n\r\nHouse must necessarily be of an ex parte nature, since\r\n\r\nthe  officer concerned cannot in the nature of  things\r\n\r\nbe  here to defend himself, and I would ask the House,\r\n\r\nin  considering  the  terms  of  this  motion  and  in\r\n\r\ndiscussion and any conclusions to which they may come,\r\n\r\nto bear that point in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Sir, that this motion really falls\r\n\r\ninto  two  parts.

On  the  first point, some of the  criticisms\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  voiced,  and  in  particular   the\r\n\r\nobservations made by the hon.

Under that section (Ordinance No.\r\n\r\n43 of 1956):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An officer not in receipt of expatriation pay who\r\n\r\nholds  his  appointment by the approval of a Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State  who following representations made  by  him\r\n\r\nbefore the expiry of a period of three years from  the\r\n\r\noperative date satisfies a Secretary of State that  he\r\n\r\nhas  reasonable  grounds  for  anxiety  regarding  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of his career in the public service  shall  be\r\n\r\neligible  to retire and receive a pension or  gratuity\r\n\r\nand  compensation for loss of career as if he were  an\r\n\r\nentitled  officer and the provisions of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nshall apply accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I am correct in saying that at the time\r\n\r\nof  the  1956 discussions in London, the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  did make it clear that he considered he  had  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards local officers who had accepted\r\n\r\nappointments under his authority, and this section was\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  Ordinance when it  was  enacted  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1956.  I do suggest to the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer,  and  those who are  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  principles involved in this  Ordinance,  that\r\n\r\nthe time when that matter should have been queried was\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Ordinance was enacted, but I have consulted\r\n\r\nHansard on the debate on the Second Reading and in the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage of the Bill, and the matter  was  not\r\n\r\nraised at that time when this Ordinance was enacted by\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the matter, Sir, is concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  particular  application which is the  subject  of\r\n\r\nthis  motion.  As  I  stated in reply  to  a  question\r\n\r\nyesterday  morning, this officer made his  application\r\n\r\nunder  that section in October 1957, and the  gist  of\r\n\r\nhis representation in short was that, in the execution\r\n\r\nof  his  duties, it had fallen to him to play a  major\r\n\r\npart  in  investigating the subversive activities  of,\r\n\r\nand taking appropriate action against, certain persons\r\n\r\nwho might at later time be in a position to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercise  influence,  either  in  or  over  a   future\r\n\r\nGovernment,   and  he  accordingly  had  grounds   for\r\n\r\napprehension regarding his future career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nthat the position of this officer in the post he fills\r\n\r\nhad  special  protection  in being  enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Constitution) Order in  Council,  but  the\r\n\r\nonly  section of which I am aware in that Order  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  this point is section 82 (1)  of  the  Order\r\n\r\nwhich provides that before any appointment is made  to\r\n\r\nthis  post  then  the  advice of  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission has to be referred to the internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  which then has the right to refer the  advice\r\n\r\nback once for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Secretary of State on this\r\n\r\napplication was given in May 1958, and I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear that the Secretary of State's decision\r\n\r\nin  this matter was made on the recommendation of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> The Governor - not the local Government. If\r\n\r\nI  may  revert for a moment to the general  principles\r\n\r\nembodied  in  this application, I would  also  mention\r\n\r\nthat   I  am  advised  that  this  section  has   been\r\n\r\nincorporated  in  similar  legislation  in  all  other\r\n\r\nterritories   at   the   time   of   their   achieving\r\n\r\nindependence  or  self-government,  namely,   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  in India, in Pakistan, in  Ghana  and  in\r\n\r\nNigeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now, Sir, to the personal decision of the\r\n\r\nofficer  to  retire  and  to  take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  he  had  been  accorded  in  reply  to  his\r\n\r\napplication,  I can only say I regret that  he  should\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to  retire, but I must  make  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear,  in  fairness to him, that he had  a  perfectly\r\n\r\nlegal  right to do so and, in this matter, he is  only\r\n\r\nexercising that legal right as an entitled officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in reply to the question yesterday,\r\n\r\nthe  compensation to which he is entitled for loss  of\r\n\r\ncareer  is  not in fact calculated on the  appointment\r\n\r\nwhich  he  fills  at the present time as  Director  of\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch, but on the previous rank held  by  him\r\n\r\nbefore   his  promotion,  and  the  sum  involved   is\r\n\r\napproximately $75,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard, Sir, to the wording of the motion that he\r\n\r\nwas  an  officer  who  had been offered  and  accepted\r\n\r\npromotion  as  a result of Malayanisation,  it  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  difficult  to  say exactly  when  a  promotion\r\n\r\nresults from Malayanisation or when it does not. If it\r\n\r\nis  to an appointment which, as a result of the policy\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  the White Paper on Malayanisation  and\r\n\r\naccepted by this House, is laid down as a post  to  be\r\n\r\nMalayanised  within  a limited period  of  time,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is  clearly no argument in the matter,  but  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular appointment the post is not  in  fact\r\n\r\ndue  for Malayanisation under the policy laid down  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper for a period of six years  from  the\r\n\r\ntime the Paper was tabled and the decision taken. That\r\n\r\nis  on the narrow definition. On the broad definition,\r\n\r\nit  is  of  course perfectly true that certain  senior\r\n\r\nofficers   have  retired  since  the   date   of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  Paper and consequently vacancies  have\r\n\r\noccurred  in the higher ranks and officers  have  been\r\n\r\nappointed thereto on promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only say, in conclusion, that I welcome the\r\n\r\nremarks  made by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  in\r\n\r\nopening his speech on this motion, and I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service as a whole will respond  to  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities under the new Government; and I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  all  parties, and in particular the party  which\r\n\r\nwill  hold  office,  will  always  subscribe  to   the\r\n\r\nprinciple that the civil service should be neutralised\r\n\r\nfrom politics, that for acts done in good faith and in\r\n\r\nan   official   capacity,  there  should   always   be\r\n\r\nministerial  protection;  that  in  matters  affecting\r\n\r\nthem, the approach by the Government should always  be\r\n\r\nobjective  and  not subjective; and  finally,  in  any\r\n\r\nissue  in which disciplinary action is involved,  that\r\n\r\nthe  matter  should  be dealt with by  an  independent\r\n\r\ntribunal,  as  is indeed provided by the existence  of\r\n\r\nthe Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped\r\n\r\nthat this motion would be debated impersonally, but  I\r\n\r\nmust  admit that this is most difficult as the  motion\r\n\r\nwould  never  have  arisen had it  not  been  for  the\r\n\r\ndefection,  if I may say so, of the officer concerned.\r\n\r\nI support the sentiments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpressed in the motion on the ground that it is\r\n\r\na principle to which the Government should subscribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malayanisation of the public service was a policy\r\n\r\nwhich my Government had pressed vigorously. Our reason\r\n\r\nwas to ensure that Ministers would have local men with\r\n\r\nlocal sympathies and the requisite local knowledge and\r\n\r\nexperience to advise them and to ensure the  execution\r\n\r\nof the Government's policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Malayanisation has benefited a good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  local officers and, in certain  instances,\r\n\r\nMinistries  have  had to make-do with available  local\r\n\r\ntalent.  That local officers should take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthis national move is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying, Sir, not to touch on personalities and I\r\n\r\nwish  to  speak  on general principles  affecting  the\r\n\r\npublic  service. The civil service has a tradition  of\r\n\r\nimpartiality,  loyalty and service, and no  Government\r\n\r\nin  its  right  senses will want to  sweep  away  this\r\n\r\ntradition.  It  is  a good tradition.  But  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  must realise that they do not exist  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  maintaining a tradition. They  must  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices and contribute strenuously to justify  this\r\n\r\ntradition   and  to  ensure  that  they   so   conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves  that all Parties who subscribe  to  it - the\r\n\r\npeople,   the   Government  and  the   civil   service\r\n\r\nthemselves - respect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have a civil service taking advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  times  and the moods, we shall be left without  a\r\n\r\npublic service, and only an empty shell of a tradition\r\n\r\nwill  mark  the  passing  of a  body  from  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the people have  a  right  to  expect\r\n\r\nservice and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has seen many changes since the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  Rendel  Constitution.  It   has\r\n\r\nadapted itself to these changes creditably. There have\r\n\r\nbeen  new  and  heavy strains and  stresses,  but  the\r\n\r\nmachinery as a whole has withstood these. I would like\r\n\r\naccordingly to pay tribute to the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has a place and a part to play in\r\n\r\nthe  changes and challenges awaiting us under the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution.  I would not like to see this  machinery\r\n\r\nimpaired  and  it  is the duty of this  Government  to\r\n\r\nensure that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvital  machinery  is  handed  over  intact,  in   good\r\n\r\ncondition  and ready to continue to serve the  people,\r\n\r\nwhatever Government may come into power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I will defend that tradition, I cannot defend\r\n\r\ndefection  on the part of any officer, and an  officer\r\n\r\nwho  sees fit under the circumstances facing us  today\r\n\r\nto  quit  the  service other than on grounds  of  ill-health  or  old  age  or other legitimate  grounds  is\r\n\r\nfailing  in his duty to the Government and the  people\r\n\r\nand damaging the tradition of the service to which  he\r\n\r\nbelongs. Respect for that service cannot be maintained\r\n\r\nif  those who are responsible for it, by their actions\r\n\r\ndisregard it and bring it into disrepute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new constitution has provided safeguards to\r\n\r\nensure the independence of the public service and  has\r\n\r\nset   up  machinery  to  maintain  its  integrity  and\r\n\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service owes its being to the public and\r\n\r\nits first duty is to serve the public through the duly\r\n\r\nconstituted  Government returned  by  the  people.  An\r\n\r\ninadequate  public  service will  make  an  inadequate\r\n\r\nGovernment rendering inadequate service to the  public\r\n\r\nand common sense dictates that no Government will want\r\n\r\nthis to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said all these things, I cannot help but\r\n\r\nshare  the  grave concern of the public  service  over\r\n\r\nwhat has been happening in the City Council since  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. took over control. Much damage has been done  to\r\n\r\nthe  morale  of  the City Council employees,  but  the\r\n\r\npublic  service  need  not be unduly  alarmed  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  adequate  protection afforded  in  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution and this protection cannot be taken  away\r\n\r\nwithout  constitutional changes.  In  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, they are not completely helpless. While  it\r\n\r\nis true that as civil servants they should steer clear\r\n\r\nof  political  activities, as citizens they  have  the\r\n\r\nright to exercise their votes freely and in their best\r\n\r\ninterests. Surely, they and their families  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies' families constitute a good percentage of the\r\n\r\nelectorate. Surely they and their families  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies' families will not be so foolish as  to  cast\r\n\r\ntheir  votes  to  bring into power a Government  whose\r\n\r\npolicy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis going to be detrimental to their security and their\r\n\r\nwellbeing.  Their fate is in their hands. They  should\r\n\r\nbestir themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked several questions by the hon. mover\r\n\r\nof  the  motion. He asked me what advice the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment tendered to the Secretary of State. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  tell him, Sir, that I was not aware of  this\r\n\r\nofficer's  intention to resign from the service  under\r\n\r\nthe   particular   section  in  this  Ordinance   - the\r\n\r\nRetirement   from  the  Public  Service   Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1956 - until sometime in November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just informed that this officer had sent in\r\n\r\nnotice  of his retirement. I was indeed flabbergasted.\r\n\r\nI  tried to do what I could to persuade; to see to  it\r\n\r\nthat such a situation did not arise which, in my view,\r\n\r\nwould embarrass this Government. It has happened.  The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar said that he warned  me\r\n\r\nthat  he would make this a political issue. I know  he\r\n\r\nwill  make it a political issue and I know that I have\r\n\r\nbeen  embarrassed, but I must say it here and now that\r\n\r\nI   have  nothing  to  do  with  it  apart  from  this\r\n\r\nparticular  Ordinance, to which I made reference  just\r\n\r\nnow.  In  this  Ordinance there is  a  section - section\r\n\r\n18 - which   gives  an  officer  the   right   to   make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Secretary of State, and  it  is\r\n\r\nfor  the Secretary of State to consider whether or not\r\n\r\nsuch  an  officer  is  entitled  to  come  under  this\r\n\r\nCompensation  Ordinance. I have  nothing  to  do  with\r\n\r\napproval or advice in regard to this matter. In  fact,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, I was flabbergasted and I was against  it\r\n\r\nbecause,  according  to my way of thinking,  to  allow\r\n\r\nsuch  an  officer to retire at a time when the  danger\r\n\r\nimagined has not happened is to indicate to the public\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  danger  cannot be avoided.  Surely  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore have not been so mesmerized or  so\r\n\r\nfrightened or so intimidated that they will  not  wake\r\n\r\nup  to the danger that faces them, that they will  not\r\n\r\nunite  and  avoid this evil that they fear  is  coming\r\n\r\ninto their midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This officer, Sir, just takes advantage of this\r\n\r\nparticular section and I must say that I do agree,  as\r\n\r\nI said earlier, with the hon, mover of the motion that\r\n\r\nsuch an advantage should not have been taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  at  this time, particularly when there is  already\r\n\r\nsufficient protection written into the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at a future date when a future Government is in\r\n\r\npower  and that future Government is conducting itself\r\n\r\nin  the  same manner as we see from the antics in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council today, surely such an officer  can  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Secretary of State that such an\r\n\r\neventuality  has  arisen and that he seeks  protection\r\n\r\nunder section 18 of this particular Ordinance. But  to\r\n\r\nseek  protection  now and to retire  now  before  that\r\n\r\neventuality  has  arisen is one  that  I  considerably\r\n\r\ndeplore. Here again, Sir, the hon. Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  in  moving  his motion,  issues  warnings  and\r\n\r\nthreats. He says that the P.A.P. will see to  it  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  expense  the  Government  has  incurred   in\r\n\r\nsending  this officer overseas for training  shall  be\r\n\r\ndeducted from whatever compensation he is to receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public service is very sensitive to\r\n\r\nutterances of this kind. If we want the public service\r\n\r\nto  serve the country well, it is up to us to see that\r\n\r\nthey  are not unnecessarily threatened or intimidated.\r\n\r\nThey  have to be instructed no doubt to do their duty,\r\n\r\nand  I  am sure the civil service know their duty  and\r\n\r\nwill  do their duty to the best of their ability.  But\r\n\r\nto  be  threatened with dire consequences as the  poor\r\n\r\nCity Council employees have been facing since 1957  is\r\n\r\nnot going to help to build up the morale of the public\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member in passing mentioned that there are\r\n\r\ntwo  members of the civil service who retired from the\r\n\r\ncivil  service without compensation because  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  into the political arena. It is true they could\r\n\r\nnot  retire with compensation because the Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance does not allow them to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nBut  one  must  not forget that they were  allowed  to\r\n\r\nretire  with their pension rights protected. One  must\r\n\r\nnot  also  forget that the Government does not  demand\r\n\r\nback  the expense that had been spent on one  of  them\r\n\r\nfor  his training. The Government does not demand that\r\n\r\nsuch expenses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be deducted from whatever pension he has\r\n\r\nand  will  be receiving. We do not go out  doing  such\r\n\r\nthings.  If we feel a thing is right, we allow  it  to\r\n\r\ntake  its course. We do not allow ourselves to  be  so\r\n\r\nstirred by emotion as to shout threats or intimidation\r\n\r\nand  such other evil things against the civil  service\r\n\r\nwhich  is  dedicated to the service of the  people  of\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. mover of the motion says that it is because\r\n\r\nof  this weak and vacillating Government that  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  has been allowed to happen. Sir,  had  this\r\n\r\nGovernment been weak and vacillating, the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar and his two colleagues would not  be\r\n\r\nsitting on that side of the House this very minute. It\r\n\r\nis   because   this  Government  is   not   weak   and\r\n\r\nvacillating,  because it is strong in its  service  to\r\n\r\nthis  country,  that subversives were  taken  away  to\r\n\r\nallow them to breathe the air of democratic freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In reply. I cannot believe that the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister intended to incite the  civil  service\r\n\r\ninto  disobedience, but I would ask the civil service,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Chief Minister was ill-advised  enough  to\r\n\r\ntell  them how they can oppose the P.A.P., to remember\r\n\r\nthis.  Keep your politics and your personal views  out\r\n\r\nof  your  service.  If you take the  Chief  Minister's\r\n\r\nadvice  and try to down the Government because you  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with  it,  then that Government  will  not\r\n\r\ntolerate  it.

Let me\r\n\r\nsay  this: In so far as an officer does his  duty,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  first  to  cheer  him,  because  nobody\r\n\r\nunderstands   the   necessity  of   having   effective\r\n\r\ninstruments of policy so well as the P.A.P. We are the\r\n\r\npeople who have a political organisation and know  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of that word \"organisation\" \r\n\r\n- the necessity to build a machine over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand above the individual, and the necessity to get your cadres.\r\n\r\nWhether they be in the civil service or the party organisation,\r\n\r\nwe cheer a man when he works hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One speaker mentioned Mr Marcus. I did not want to bring up City Council matters\r\n\r\nin this Chamber. Mr Marcus was a good officer. For that reason, he was promoted and\r\n\r\nwe cheered him. But Mr Marcus mistook his loyalty to\r\n\r\nhis brother, as his duty to the people. When he did that, he went against the primary \r\n\r\nprinciple to which we subscribe - service first and service last, and your brothers\r\n\r\nand your relatives do not count. That is basic and fundamental. If Members in this House would like to \r\n\r\nknow, Mr Marcus also happen to be a brother-in-law of a Central Committee member of the People's Action \r\n\r\nParty, but we do what is right by the public, not by our friends and our relatives. He was promoted not because\r\n\r\nhe was a relative of this Member. When he defended his brother, although his brother was in the \r\n\r\nwrong, he was brushed aside. I told the civil servant who is in charge of the Establishment Section\r\n\r\nquite frankly that that is the policy of the Party and that he had nothing to fear, whatever\r\n\r\nhis personal views were. But if he was asked to execute policy and he allowed his personal considerations\r\n\r\nto prevent him from executing that policy, then he must be prepared to fight the Party - and no civil servant\r\n\r\nis in a position to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

I say this. Whatever you do or you do not do, remember this - that\r\n\r\nthe civil servant has only his career at stake. When we enter the  political\r\n\r\narena - unless we do it for half a million dollars at a time and vanish with it - our lives are \r\n\r\nat stake. When my colleagues' lives and my life are at stake, I say this: I will brook no \r\n\r\nnonsense from my quarter, not from the Chief Minister or any Government. He said that these \r\n\r\nthings were done without his knowledge. What kind of a Government is his? He is responsible \r\n\r\nfor this. He advises the Secretary of State. His Government does it and it is his business to see\r\n\r\nthat the Governor gives the right advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister is a wily and able politician, unlike the nominated Member,\r\n\r\nMr R. C. H. Lim. He knew that it was political suicide to try and defend this officer.\r\n\r\nMr R. C. H. Lim wanted to defend him, not the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister joined me in deploring\r\n\r\nthis act which is worse than defection. When Dr Otto John hopped from West Germany to East Germany, he defected.\r\n\r\nWhen he hopped back from East Germany to West Germany, he also defected, but there were deep\r\n\r\npolitical complications and emotional implications. But when this officer says,\"Give me $75,000.\r\n\r\nI am going into private practice. What is more, I am going to take my five months' leave with full\r\n\r\npay and I will sit in Chambers as a lawyer while awaiting admission to the local Bar. Then\r\n\r\nI am going to make money\" I say that is not defection. It is a sell-out. I am not threatening any \r\n\r\ncivil servant. In fact, I went out of my way at the outset to state the Party policy on the civil service \r\n\r\ngenerally. But I say to this officer, if he believed that the P.A.P. was going to do him in,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen either he must have a very guilty conscience, something which he has done which he would\r\n\r\nnot like us to know about, or he has not got the courage of his convictions to step out and fight the \r\n\r\nP.A.P. on the S.P.A. ticket. If he does that, we will pay him his pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say this quite frankly, particularly to the English Press. They may have gone out of their way to give\r\n\r\nthe English-educated, particularly the civil servants, the fright of their lives. Changes are going to come within\r\n\r\nthe next few months, and they are necessary and vital if we are to survive and not collapse. If the \r\n\r\nEnglish-educated knew what the problem were, they would be the first to cheer us, because we are making it \r\n\r\npossible for the system to survive and not collapse. If you get Ministers who resign on the eve  of a big \r\n\r\ndebate on an enquiry into their financial affairs and they are referred to as the democratic forces, setting an\r\n\r\nexample to the civil servants, then I say that the whole system will collapse. Anybody and everybody will\r\n\r\ngrab half a million dollars at a time and flee the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this of the Director of the Special Branch. He says that he is anxious. I should have thought that with\r\n\r\n12 years of special training in that job he should have nerves of steel! Anxiety! If he had felt\r\n\r\nanxious, he should have seen a doctor and got a couple of tranquillizers that would put his nerves right!\r\n\r\nThere were no grounds for anxiety whatsoever. If he felt there were, it was because he had no confidence\r\n\r\nwhatsoever in the Labour Front Government at the time when he resigned in November-it might have been\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front, it might have been the S.P.A. On the general principle, I do not think anybody has\r\n\r\ngot the courage to disagree. As regards this particular officer, I say that we are not going to leave the matter\r\n\r\nthere, because it is an absolute scandal that he should have been allowed to go back to finish his legal training \r\n\r\nat public expense and then come and say,\"Well,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am anxious about my future.\" Nothing is a better tranquillizer than $75,000 in the kitty! It is disgusting,\r\n\r\nan utter disgrace to the whole police force and the public service, and I would like the House to know that \r\n\r\nif he were here to defend himself, he would shrivel for shame. It is a lucky thing that he does not have to be \r\n\r\nin this House, and he ought to be thoroughly ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member has sat down.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I did not want to interfere just now while the hon.

We have read in  the  papers  that\r\n\r\nthese  unfortunate people lost practically  everything\r\n\r\nthey  owned.  They  lost  their  household  goods  and\r\n\r\npersonal  effects, their furniture, their poultry  and\r\n\r\nlivestock.  These people are now undergoing  hardships\r\n\r\nand  worried  about their future and the  question  of\r\n\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these problems would not have come about if the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in  the  City Council had  kept  its  election\r\n\r\npledge  to  look after the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, in this case the people in Tiong  Bahru.  A\r\n\r\nlarge part of the area was razed to the ground, due to\r\n\r\nlack  of  water  available for the use  of  the  fire-engines.  The attap dwellers in this area looked  with\r\n\r\ndespair  at their burning huts, while the firemen  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary  firefighters  were  unable  to  save   them\r\n\r\nbecause  of lack of water. I say the P.A.P. dominated\r\n\r\nCity Council is responsible, because we have time  and\r\n\r\ntime again approached the City Council asking them  to\r\n\r\nput up standpipes in the area. We have also asked them\r\n\r\nto  replace the small main waterpipes with big  pipes.\r\n\r\nAnd  even the supply of water, at low pressure, in the\r\n\r\nkampong  was  blocked on many occasions  by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  The  Liberal-Socialist City Councillor,  Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Bah  Chee, and myself brought up the matter,  and\r\n\r\nthe  reply  given  was  that it would  cost  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil a lot of money to replace the old pipes. I  am\r\n\r\nreally  surprised,  Sir, that the City  Council  could\r\n\r\nafford  to  spend  over $105,000 on its  Anti-Spitting\r\n\r\nCampaign, and that the Mayor, upon his election, asked\r\n\r\nfor over $7,000 a month in salary and allowances. Yet,\r\n\r\nSir, they replied that they were unable to replace the\r\n\r\npipes  because of lack of money. They did not  realise\r\n\r\nthat  this  main pipe supplies water to thousands  and\r\n\r\nthousands of residents in that area where the big fire\r\n\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have not only failed in their duty to\r\n\r\nserve  the  people of Singapore, but  they  have  also\r\n\r\ntried  to cash in on the misery of these people.  With\r\n\r\nyour  permission,  Sir, I wish  to  quote  the  second\r\n\r\nparagraph of the paper, The Malayan Undergrad:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Residents from the nearby King Edward VII Medical\r\n\r\nHostel rushed to the scene of the fire to render  aid.\r\n\r\nThey  did all they could, but unfortunately supporters\r\n\r\nof  the  People's  Action Party wanted  them  to  wear\r\n\r\narmbands bearing their Party symbol.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cashing in on the misery of these people who have\r\n\r\nlost everything, P.A.P. supporters converted a coffee-shop, which was only 150 yards away from the scene  of\r\n\r\nthe fire, into a centre of registration and collection\r\n\r\nof  cash. The medical students, anxious to render  aid\r\n\r\nto the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfire victims, were taken in by the pseudo, volunteers.\r\n\r\nThese  students,  all innocent and anxious  to  render\r\n\r\naid,  did voluntary work in registering the poor  fire\r\n\r\nvictims. I went to the coffee-shop and recognized some\r\n\r\nof   these  pseudo-volunteers  as  supporters  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party. I spoke to  a  few  of  these\r\n\r\npseudo-volunteers myself, and I am convinced that they\r\n\r\nare,  in  actual  fact, supporters or members  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party. After my argument with some  of\r\n\r\nthem  there, the students believed it was true because\r\n\r\none of them rushed in and took out a bunch of armbands\r\n\r\nand asked them to put them on. While this argument was\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in  front of the coffee-shop,  the  pseudo-volunteers  planted  a huge flag  bearing  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nemblem,  and political speeches were made through  the\r\n\r\nloud-speakers  which  they had installed.  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"The P.A.P. is the only Party in Singapore which comes\r\n\r\nto the aid of those unfortunate. The Government is not\r\n\r\ndoing anything. No political Party is doing anything.\"\r\n\r\nThey   condemned  other  political  Parties  and   put\r\n\r\nquestions  through the loud-speakers, \"Where  are  the\r\n\r\nother political Parties who profess that they serve or\r\n\r\nare  working  in  the  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\" But they forgot, Sir, that I was there  on\r\n\r\nthe  spot!  I was there right up to 3 a.m. on  Friday,\r\n\r\n13th  February, 1959. Such propaganda! Sir,  the  fire\r\n\r\nprovided a golden opportunity for the P.A.P. to  tell\r\n\r\nsuch  lies to the people. In my opinion, such speeches\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  supporters of the P.A.P. attacking  the\r\n\r\nactivities    of   other   political   Parties    were\r\n\r\nunjustified, particularly on such a sad day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to mention the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar's statement  about  Mr\r\n\r\nMarcus, the Hawker Superintendent in the City Council.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because  his elder brother, the C.A.O.  (Chief\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer), also of  the  City  Council,\r\n\r\ntried  to protect him, and that is why he, the C.A.O.,\r\n\r\ncannot remain true to the P.A.P. The truth is that  in\r\n\r\nthe same area of Kampong Tiong Bahru, that is, Kampong\r\n\r\nSilat,  there  is a very big group of hawkers.  Orders\r\n\r\nwere given by the Mayor himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto arrest these hawkers in that kampong.

He only sent an Inspector to  check  and\r\n\r\nthat  Inspector, I am sorry to say, went out to  check\r\n\r\nbut  did  not return. The whole thing went on for  two\r\n\r\nand a half hours. The least the Assistant Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police  could do was to instruct his  officers  to\r\n\r\ntake  down the names and addresses of these offenders.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that if they did so on that day, these\r\n\r\npseudo-volunteers would disperse.  I  could  tell  you\r\n\r\nthey  would  run away with their tails  between  their\r\n\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion, as I said, has caused many people\r\n\r\nto  be  homeless, and I would like the  Government  to\r\n\r\nreply to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just on a point of clarification.

First, there are quite a number of  people\r\n\r\nwho  owned  houses  in the kampong and  who  had  lost\r\n\r\neverything  in  the fire. I wonder whether  Government\r\n\r\ncould   compensate   these  people.   In   Queenstown,\r\n\r\nGovernment intends building many multi-storey flats as\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  the squatters or  attap-dwellers  in\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  Similarly in this case, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Chief Minister whether Government will  give\r\n\r\ncompensation,  particularly to those people  who  grow\r\n\r\nfood,  the farmers - give them land and cash  for  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  lost  in the fire. And as  the  Government\r\n\r\nintend building multi-storey flats, it is my hope that\r\n\r\nthey will compensate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the few huts which were partly burnt by the\r\n\r\nfire  or  their planked walls damaged by fire-fighters\r\n\r\nwhen they were making fire lanes. These squatters were\r\n\r\nnot  given  any aid by the Social Welfare  or  by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil for Social Services. Will Government see to it\r\n\r\nthat  these  people  who  need urgent  assistance  are\r\n\r\nattended to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, in the case of people who owned shops\r\n\r\nin  this  kampong: when the S.I.T. flats are built  in\r\n\r\nthat area, will these people be given priority to  own\r\n\r\nshops in these multi-storey buildings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I am convinced, Sir, that Government will not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to complete those multi-storey buildings  on\r\n\r\nthe  site  of  the fire within three  months,  but  as\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  so  generous  in  giving  them  three\r\n\r\nmonth's occupation of the Kallang flats without  rent,\r\n\r\nlight  and water, I suggest that Government give  them\r\n\r\nsix   months   to   stay  without   rent,   light   or\r\n\r\nwater - [Laughter] - that is, until the huts-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

He deplored that  fact  that\r\n\r\npeople went about and did acts of charity and kindness\r\n\r\nin  order  that pictures could be taken and published.\r\n\r\nHe  particularly  expressed  his  displeasure  at  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion in our Petir editorial that he went down to\r\n\r\nKampong  Tiong  Bahru, became an amateur fire-fighter,\r\n\r\nand,  as expected, it appeared in the papers next day.\r\n\r\nHe  vehemently  protested that it was not  his  desire\r\n\r\nthat this should be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two copies of two Party organs.

He might be interested to know that a  picture\r\n\r\nshowing  him  with trousers rolled up and  carrying  a\r\n\r\nbucket  of  water, appears on the front  page  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The 24th of February, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nit  was at the first mass rally they were compelled to\r\n\r\nhold  after we got started on our third. He might also\r\n\r\nbe  interested  to know that, despite his  allegations\r\n\r\nthat we went about with photographers, we did not have\r\n\r\npictures  of the fire in our issue of our Petir  after\r\n\r\nthe  fire.  In  fact,  we were kind  enough,  when  we\r\n\r\npublished  the debate, not only to publish a  copy  of\r\n\r\nthe Mayor's but also a copy of Mr Tang Peng Yeu's for\r\n\r\nthe  people's  delectation. Sir,  at  the  time  these\r\n\r\nrespective Party tracts were issued, I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  anybody expected the Member for Tiong Bahru  to\r\n\r\ntry and redeem his position somehow by moving a motion\r\n\r\nin  this  House about the fire.

But for  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar to come now and tell us  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Tiong  Bahru  deplored  the  act  of\r\n\r\nkindness  shown  by the people is, I  think,  entirely\r\n\r\ngroundless.  It  is not because the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru wants to deplore the act of kindness. It is  not\r\n\r\njust because you want publicity for your own Party  or\r\n\r\nfor  yourself  that you go there to  do  your  act  of\r\n\r\nkindness. It is a humanitarian act for the victims who\r\n\r\nwere  caught in the fire.

Sir, it is out of the kindness of his  heart\r\n\r\nand  his sense of duty that the Chief Minister thought\r\n\r\nof  the  plight  of  the  victims,  and  therefore  he\r\n\r\nvolunteered  his services by holding a hose  to  fight\r\n\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The proof is in the picture!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Unfortunately the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar himself was not there to  put  out  the\r\n\r\nfire!  If  he had been there, he would have  witnessed\r\n\r\nwith  his own eyes that the Chief Minister held a hose\r\n\r\nto  fight the fire - not like the P.A.P. or the Mayor of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  brought along with them  photographers\r\n\r\nand a fire-engine. Is that what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  called an act of kindness? I cannot believe it. It\r\n\r\nis  just  because  he  hoped  against  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  would publish on the front page  the  next\r\n\r\nday  a picture of the Mayor directing the fire-engine.\r\n\r\nAnd   he  hoped  his  own  photographers,  should  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers fail to print the picture, would bring that\r\n\r\npicture to the Press for publication. He claims in his\r\n\r\nPetir  that  there is no publicity of any  picture  at\r\n\r\nall.  It  is because the P.A.P. has got no courage  to\r\n\r\nprint  any picture of the actual act or the  good  act\r\n\r\nthey  have done. It is because the Petir has  not  got\r\n\r\nthe courage to show that the Mayor himself went to the\r\n\r\nscene  of  the  fire  with  the  fire-engine  and  the\r\n\r\nphotographers. That was the reason why the Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru has brought up this motion today. I really\r\n\r\ncannot  understand  why,  when  there  is  plight  and\r\n\r\nmisery,  when  the  residents of the attap-houses  are\r\n\r\nsubject  to hardships by the fire, and have  lost  all\r\n\r\ntheir  belongings,  the People's Action  Party  should\r\n\r\nexploit  the  situation  by  going  there  and  making\r\n\r\nelection  speeches. Although Nomination  Day  has  not\r\n\r\ncome  yet,  we are still allowed to make our  election\r\n\r\nspeeches  and  election  campaigns,  but  not  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of the fire victims. The People's Action Party\r\n\r\nheld  a  mass  rally at Jalan Kayu; so  also  had  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Alliance,  but not at  the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\nmisery  of  the public. To have election campaigns  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the fire victims and to exploit them is\r\n\r\nbeyond expression.

What  I  am\r\n\r\nreally   concerned  about  are  the  so-called  pseudo\r\n\r\nvolunteers   who  worked  under  cover  as   volunteer\r\n\r\nworkers.

But I do  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that, though I am no longer interested in a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry, because the truth in so far  as\r\n\r\nwe are concerned is already out, if they say that they\r\n\r\nare  not implicated in this, then it is their business\r\n\r\nto  clear themselves by a Commission of Inquiry or any\r\n\r\nother means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to go back to the 15th of February, at the first\r\n\r\npre-election  rally of the P.A.P. at Hong  Lim  Green,\r\n\r\nwhere Dr Toh Chin Chye, the Chairman, opened with  an\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the current situation in  Singapore.  He\r\n\r\nstated, inter alia, that \"second powerful patrons  for\r\n\r\nTun  Lim  and  the  S.P.A. are  the  British  and  the\r\n\r\nAmericans.\"  Then  with regard to  the  Americans,  he\r\n\r\nsaid, \"But the Americans are less discreet. They  have\r\n\r\nlots  of  money, so there is no difficulty at  all  in\r\n\r\ngiving money to those whom they hope to win and it  is\r\n\r\nan  open secret that income tax investigation into the\r\n\r\nhalf  a  million dollar account at the First  National\r\n\r\nCity  Bank  of New York in the name of a Minister  was\r\n\r\nquickly  choked  off,  because  this  money,  being  a\r\n\r\npolitical   gift,  was  not  liable  to  income   tax.\r\n\r\nAmericans are very slow in learning that those who can\r\n\r\nbe bought for money are not worth the buying.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member identify the paper?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, this was a speech made by the\r\n\r\nChairman of the P.A.P. and it has been reproduced in the\r\n\r\nMarch issue of the Petir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times then carried the story on the 16th\r\n\r\nof  February,  at page 5. On the 16th there  were  big\r\n\r\nconsultations between bank officials, the U.S. Consul-General  and  the  S.P.A. leadership.  Wishing  to  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  as  usual, the Straits Times  gave  a  banner\r\n\r\nheadline \"That $500,000,000\" - er - \r\n\r\n\"$500,000\".  I  am  sure Mr Chew wishes  it  is  $500\r\n\r\nmillion. It is much more worthwhile. \"I deny  this.  A\r\n\r\nstupid  lie!  \",  says the S.P.A. Sir,  this  is  very\r\n\r\ninteresting because I think this sparked off the whole\r\n\r\ndispute. We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever  accused  any  Minister  of  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nrobbing any bank or cheating anybody of $500,000.  All\r\n\r\nwe  said  was,  from  an American  source,  there  was\r\n\r\n$500,000  in the name of a Minister of the  Government\r\n\r\nin  the First National City Bank of New York. We  even\r\n\r\nnamed  the  bank, just to be helpful, and that  income\r\n\r\ntax investigations were started and choked off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to tell the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\nthis:  that one of the duties of the civil service  is\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  orders, but they  have  to  be  lawful\r\n\r\norders. He need not answer, but if he does, he  should\r\n\r\ngive  correct  and truthful answers. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntell  him  this: there is very little about this  case\r\n\r\nthat we do not know about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we go back to the 17th of February - the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes. This is, I think, the biggest blunder ever made\r\n\r\nby  a  group  of  politicians with the  help  of  bank\r\n\r\nofficials and consular staff. They went and denied the\r\n\r\ntruth.  One could laugh at truth, brush it aside,  and\r\n\r\npretend  that it does not exist. But to  deny  it  and\r\n\r\ncall  the other man a liar, then it becomes an  issue.\r\n\r\nBecause,  first  of  all, you confess  that  what  was\r\n\r\nstated,  if true, was most discreditable and damaging,\r\n\r\nand  that it was wrong; and secondly, you compel  your\r\n\r\nopponent to force the issue. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore People's Alliance today denied a P.A.P.\r\n\r\nallegation  that  the Americans had  given  the  party\r\n\r\n$500,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we never said they had given the S.P.A.\r\n\r\n$500,000.  At  the time when the money  was  paid  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. had not been formed. It is obvious in my motion\r\n\r\nthat  investigations  into  this  account  stopped  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1958. We did not say it was the  S.P.A.  We\r\n\r\nsaid it was a group. It did not matter whether it  was\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A. or any other name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The U.S. Consulate-General also issued a statement\r\n\r\ndenying   that  the  U.S.  Government  had  made   any\r\n\r\ncontribution to the S.P.A. and emphasising that it was\r\n\r\nU.S.  Government  policy  not  to  interfere  in   the\r\n\r\npolitical affairs of other nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never said it was the U.S. Government. We said it\r\n\r\nwas  from  an American source - $500,000 in an  American\r\n\r\nbank. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Newell. This is the art, popularly called in\r\n\r\nLatin - suppressio veri suggestio falsi - you, state  the\r\n\r\ntruth  in  a  form  which does not make  it,  strictly\r\n\r\nspeaking, an untruth, but you thereby suggest  a  lie.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr R. P. Newell, General Manager of the Singapore\r\n\r\nBranch  of  the First National City Bank of New  York,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There had been no income tax investigation\r\n\r\nconcerning an alleged $500,000 account in the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No one from the income tax department has asked us\r\n\r\nif there is such an account', he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Newell added that no individual in the Singapore Government had such an account with the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a little bit foolish because Mr Chew,\r\n\r\nas  part  of his farewell gesture before he absconded,\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he did have an account at this  bank,  but\r\n\r\nnothing  like  $500,000. I can quite believe  that  it\r\n\r\nmust  have  gone  down somewhat  since  it  was  first\r\n\r\ncredited to his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, let us hear what Mr Wang Tsun Hao,\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the S.P.A., said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"The statement made by the PAP Chairman, Dr Toh\r\n\r\nChin Chye, that the SPA is receiving monetary aid from\r\n\r\nbank  cornpradores and British and  Americans,  is  as\r\n\r\nfalse as it is stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation that the Americans had given $500,000\r\n\r\nto the SPA is completely unfounded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wang added: \"Since the PAP is so interested in\r\n\r\nrumours and lies, it should not ignore the rumour that\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  is receiving aid from international  sources\r\n\r\nthrough a local bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also not ignore the rumour that $100,000 of\r\n\r\ntrade union funds went into the PAP treasury.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry for Mr Wang. I do not know if he was\r\n\r\naware  of  the truth when he issued the statement,  or\r\n\r\nwho  advised  him to issue that statement.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry to say that, because he was so ill advised as to\r\n\r\ncall the Chairman of the P.A.P. a liar, we called  for\r\n\r\na Commission of Inquiry. There was no crime. No act of\r\n\r\nillegality had been committed. We have not accused the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department of doing something irregular. In\r\n\r\nfact, we admit that if the money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  a  political gift, as we say it must  have  been,\r\n\r\nthen  it is not liable to income tax. But I will  come\r\n\r\nto the business of the choking-off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary said yesterday that Mr Chew\r\n\r\nnever  saw  Mr  Holloway. I know  Mr  Chew  saw  Mr\r\n\r\nHolloway  and  that it was recorded  in  a  file.  But\r\n\r\nbefore we reach that point, may I say what happened as\r\n\r\na result of that denial? Dr Toh said - it was published\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times on 18th February:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Newell, the manager of the National City Bank of\r\n\r\nNew York, said his bank was not involved in any income\r\n\r\ntax investigations. But I said that investigations had\r\n\r\nbeen initiated and were stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Newell said no person in the Singapore Government now has such an account. But he did not say that no\r\n\r\nmoney  had ever at any time been remitted to his  bank\r\n\r\nto   be  operated  by  a  Minister  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Consulate-General denied the U.S. Government\r\n\r\npaid money to the SPA. We have never alleged that  the\r\n\r\nU.S. Government was involved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the call for a Commission of Inquiry, just\r\n\r\nto  establish facts. We have not suggested a crime was\r\n\r\ncommitted. But since we were called liars for  telling\r\n\r\nthe  truth, then the truth should be known. When I had\r\n\r\nto table a motion in order to have this matter brought\r\n\r\nup  in  this Assembly, the Straits Times on  the  19th\r\n\r\nFebruary carried Mr Chew Swee Kee's portrait  on  the\r\n\r\nfront  page - and his famous last words, \"My conscience\r\n\r\nis clear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Asked for his comments on Mr Lee's motion, Mr Chew\r\n\r\nSwee   Kee   told  the  Straits  Times  tonight:   'My\r\n\r\nconscience is clear, I have nothing to fear.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost a doggerel. [Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There seems to be some disorder\r\n\r\nin   the  Strangers'  Gallery.

For instance, the Straits Times  of\r\n\r\nthe  17th  of February in an editorial was ill-advised\r\n\r\nto  take  sides  on this matter before they  knew  the\r\n\r\ntruth. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dr Toh laced the smear with the charge that the\r\n\r\nAmericans  have banked half a million dollars  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of  one  of Singapore's Ministers, a  fine  tale\r\n\r\nwhich  has  promptly  been  denied.  This  unsupported\r\n\r\ncharge, and the curious attack ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and so on, and so on-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...a dirty beginning to the coming elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but the dirt does not come from us. We just\r\n\r\ndisclosed  it  to make sure that people  did  not  get\r\n\r\ncontagious germs as a result of the dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my duty now, briefly, to recite the facts,\r\n\r\nbecause Mr Chew, as he left his duties yesterday, saw\r\n\r\nfit to issue a statement in which he said, inter alia,\r\n\r\npublished in today's Straits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In fact the Government decided to oppose the motion\r\n\r\nthat  was  coming up for debate on March 4  and  there\r\n\r\nwas,  therefore,  no  question  of  any  fear  that  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry would be set up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am astounded at the audacity of this man. First of\r\n\r\nall,  he  is  breaching the Official  Secrets  Act  by\r\n\r\nletting  out what the Council of Ministers had decided\r\n\r\nin privacy. Secondly, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, since there is not going to be an inquiry on\r\n\r\nme, therefore I leave with my conscience clear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I will fight the election under the S.P.A. banner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Presumably he will, because if he is the man that  has\r\n\r\nthe money, he calls the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I can now devote more time to party organisation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows what organisation the S.P.A. has\r\n\r\ngot  in its air-conditioned office in Victoria Street.\r\n\r\nBut not everybody knows where the money came from. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  we  do.  And I say quite frankly  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing which I am going to state which are not  facts\r\n\r\nand  which I cannot justify up to the hilt. I  do  not\r\n\r\nrequire a Commission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry. Mr Chew's absence today is a  confession\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  guilty.  I further  suggest  this:  that\r\n\r\nalthough  he  is  not guilty of any crime,  but  of  a\r\n\r\ntreacherous  political act, the fact that  he  commits\r\n\r\npolitical suicide does not absolve his accomplices. It\r\n\r\nmay  prevent  his  accomplices from being  discovered,\r\n\r\nbecause  he has betaken himself to another place,  but\r\n\r\nit  does not absolve them altogether. But he did admit\r\n\r\nthis - and  this  appears in the Singapore  Standard  of\r\n\r\ntoday's date, 4th March, page four:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Asked whether it was true that he had had an account\r\n\r\nwith the National City Bank, Mr Chew said it was.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well, well, why did the manager say \"No\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that we\r\n\r\nhave  got all the cards on the table. Mr Chew's  file\r\n\r\nis  G.S. 47909. As a former Government servant, he has\r\n\r\nthe  cipher \"G.S.\". Investigations were commenced into\r\n\r\nthis account in September 1958. Mr Chew went and  saw\r\n\r\nMr   Holloway.   There  was  some   explanation   and\r\n\r\ninvestigations  were lifted from their normal  course.\r\n\r\nWe are not suggesting that it was wrong that no income\r\n\r\ntax  was  to  be imposed. We admit that if  it  was  a\r\n\r\npolitical gift, there should be no income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that Mr Chew paid out of this account a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $30,000 to Mr Liu Yi Chih, former proprietor\r\n\r\nof  the Ih Shih Press, and with this money Mr Liu  Yi\r\n\r\nChih  said he bought a house at No. 12, Worthing Road,\r\n\r\nSerangoon Garden Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could go into further details which do not\r\n\r\nreally  concern  Mr  Chew but  will  corroborate  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  facts that we have got. What was  this  money\r\n\r\nfor?  Well, that is not our business. Whatever he  and\r\n\r\nhis  caucus  wanted to do with it was their  business.\r\n\r\nBut we say two sources can be checked with great ease:\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  control  and  income  tax.  Foreign\r\n\r\nExchange  Control  will show the transaction  in  U.S.\r\n\r\ndollars  - about  $150,000 (gold) - and Income  Tax  will\r\n\r\nshow when investigations were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommenced;  when  they  were taken  away  from  normal\r\n\r\nchannels;  when  Mr Chew met Mr Holloway;  and  when\r\n\r\ninvestigations were stopped because the Comptroller of\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  was satisfied that it was not  liable  to\r\n\r\nincome tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am stating another fact openly and publicly\r\n\r\nbecause  I do not think that there is anything  to  be\r\n\r\ngained by suppressing it, and I have the permission of\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Mr Francis Thomas, to do so. Mr Chew  told\r\n\r\nMr  Thomas  at the end of 1957 that he  got  $100,000\r\n\r\nU.S. gold for the Party. Mr Thomas is here to answer,\r\n\r\nif  I  am  accused  of  telling  a  lie.  I  have  his\r\n\r\npermission to state this also. Mr Chew is  not  here.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  hear what he has to say from the wilderness\r\n\r\nto  which he has betaken himself. I say that that U.S.\r\n\r\n$100,000 gold was given to Mr Chew Swee Kee  in  1957\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes, inter alia, of  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nelections;  and  in  the same way over  U.S.  $150,000\r\n\r\ngold,  amounting to M$500,000 was given some  time  in\r\n\r\n1958  for  the  same  political  purposes.  These  are\r\n\r\nirrefutable  facts.  I do not see  why  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance got hot under the collar about this.\r\n\r\nWe  never  said  it  was  for the  Sinapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance.  It was not formed yet. At that  time,  they\r\n\r\nwere  collecting  all the chickens into  the  nest  to\r\n\r\nfield  them as prospective candidates. Members of  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist  Party were  being  inveigled  over.\r\n\r\nThere  was  money  for  jam.  Everybody  was  to   get\r\n\r\nsomething. The name does not matter. It might  be  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance; it might be the Donkeys' Parade. It\r\n\r\nmight be anything. But the important fact is that  the\r\n\r\ncash  was  there  and  Mr R. Jumabhoy  has  mentioned\r\n\r\ndisclosures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Telok Ayer tells me\r\n\r\nthat he has also got something on this.

But Mr Chew\r\n\r\nshould  hear  what the bankers say, \"Five  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand dollars, is that all? So cheap, you could\r\n\r\nhave  bought  out the whole gang for five  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand dollars!\" Why was he so silly? Sir,I do\r\n\r\nnot know. It is not my business. No crime has been\r\n\r\ncommitted, but an act of political folly  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest magnitude has been perpetrated. It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for the Government whether they  want  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  extr1cate themselves  from  the  act  of\r\n\r\nindiscretion  of Mr Chew. The indiscretion  lies\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  collection of $500,000, but  in  the\r\n\r\nfolly  of  putting it in a bank in  his  name;  he\r\n\r\nhaving  once  worked in the Income Tax  Department\r\n\r\nshould  know that these things can be discovered.\r\n\r\nSir,  I had wanted to congratulate him today  for\r\n\r\nhis  great qualities as a salesman, because if  he\r\n\r\ncould  get  $500,000 in hard cash from hard-boiled\r\n\r\nAmericans,   then  it  speaks  volumes   for   his\r\n\r\nsalesmanship, because, with his Party known to  be\r\n\r\nbankrupt,   it  is  really  a  masterly   act   of\r\n\r\nsalesmanship which takes a lot to be excelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts are there.

Americans and\r\n\r\nWesterners  are giving their aid  to  one  or  the\r\n\r\nother country and thereby having an economic  hold\r\n\r\non  these  countries.  But  those  countries  are\r\n\r\nindependent  and it is for them to accept  it  or\r\n\r\nnot. We are still a Colony. So, is it right on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Americans to send money to influence\r\n\r\nthe political elections in this Colony?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been reading in the Press as to what\r\n\r\nhas   happened  to  the  $500,000.  Sir,  in  this\r\n\r\nmorning's  Straits Times - I am quoting  from  it - it\r\n\r\nsays - this is Mr Chew's statement:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I stress here that I have nothing to hide. My\r\n\r\nresignation was purely voluntary one on my part as\r\n\r\nI  felt  that  the good name of the  SPA  must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if one is a good businessman, one should\r\n\r\ndefend  oneself,  and say that the  accusation  is\r\n\r\neither  right  or wrong. Here, in  spite  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion  against  him,  he has  resigned  from  his\r\n\r\nMinistership  and the Assembly,  to  escape  from\r\n\r\nhaving  to  reply. This is not enough.  If  he  is\r\n\r\nescaping from having to reply as a Minister,  then\r\n\r\nit  is the collective responsibility of the other\r\n\r\nMinisters  to reply. They must hold this  inquiry,\r\n\r\nin  fairness and justice to Singapore, and to  the\r\n\r\nAmericans  as  to whether or not the  charges  are\r\n\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, about this flush of money. I understand\r\n\r\nfrom  reliable  sources that last month  Mr  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee  bought  a house in Wilkinson  Road  for\r\n\r\n$75,000.  There are also rumours that he  has  got\r\n\r\nmining interests in Ipoh. Sir, when Ministers take\r\n\r\noffice, they have to declare their assets to  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor and we know  what  their\r\n\r\nincomes  are. We also know that they are forbidden\r\n\r\nto  trade, and if they do trade they must declare.\r\n\r\nThus,  with the limited income to meet Singapore's\r\n\r\nhigh  cost of living, how much can one save? Where\r\n\r\ndoes the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  come  from  after three or  four  years  in\r\n\r\noffice?  Do  you  not think, Sir, that  they  must\r\n\r\nsatisfy the public's query? It is the duty of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers to disclose all these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be very interesting to say from this\r\n\r\nside  of  the House that members of the  Liberal-Socialists at a meeting said, not once but twice,\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  the chief reasons for  leaving  the\r\n\r\nParty was because the Party had not got money  for\r\n\r\nelections.  Here  the S.P.A. has  got  plenty  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  tons of money! This was said in the  Party\r\n\r\nmeeting, and I can bring 40 or 50 witnesses if  it\r\n\r\nis said that my statement is childish, or if it is\r\n\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the voters of Singapore so foolish as to\r\n\r\nallow their votes to be bought by foreign aid,  or\r\n\r\nby any aid? They are no fools. Instead, they would\r\n\r\nreply  that in the coming elections, the  S.P.A.'s\r\n\r\ncandidates  would  lose their deposits.  And  not\r\n\r\nonly  this, they should elect people of  integrity\r\n\r\nof  character  who can safeguard the interests  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and its people. Further, Sir,  if  I  am\r\n\r\nelected,  I would like the Government to  inquire\r\n\r\ninto   the  assets  of  those  who  are   now   in\r\n\r\npower - liquid   assets,  movable   and   immovable\r\n\r\nassets,  either here or overseas,  and  either  in\r\n\r\ntheir names or in their relatives' names. This has\r\n\r\nbeen done in other countries, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S.P.A. presents a very sad spectacle.\r\n\r\nThey were elected on the Labour Front ticket. The\r\n\r\npublic  chose  to  elect ten  of  them.  With  the\r\n\r\ncontrivance and with the help of the nominated and\r\n\r\nex-officio  Members, they have governed  for  some\r\n\r\ntime.  Within  three or six months, three  of  its\r\n\r\nmembers left the Party and came to our side.  That\r\n\r\nis  a  fact - the  ex-members are  still  here.  And\r\n\r\nlater,  Sir,  the  former Chief  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nresigned  his Chief Ministership and had to  leave\r\n\r\nthe Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It  is  indeed\r\n\r\nregrettable that the person named is not here this\r\n\r\nafternoon  to  answer the charges  specifically\r\n\r\nlaid at his door. I must, I feel, in fairness  to\r\n\r\nhim, to my Ministerial colleagues and to my Party,\r\n\r\nsay  that he saw me yesterday and told me that  he\r\n\r\nwould resign his seat from the Assembly and  as  a\r\n\r\nMinister  of the Government, because he felt  that\r\n\r\nin  doing  this  he would save some embarrassment\r\n\r\nfor me and for my Party. I did not know and do not\r\n\r\nunderstand  what caused him to take this  line  of\r\n\r\nreasoning.  But  I feel that as  he  was  a  loyal\r\n\r\ncolleague of mine, and as he had given of his best\r\n\r\nwhilst he was a Minister in the Government in the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  his portfolio, I thought  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be proper for me to accede to his request. I\r\n\r\nallowed him to resign. I would have liked  him  to\r\n\r\nremain and face these charges and answer them,  so\r\n\r\nthat  this Assembly as well as the public can have\r\n\r\na proper assessment of whether or not such charges\r\n\r\nare true or unfounded, or are just mere political\r\n\r\ndistortions.  Unfortunately, he  is  not  here  to\r\n\r\nreply.  But  what  I resent most strongly  is  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  in the speech of the seconder  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion that, by his resignation, he has damned all\r\n\r\nof   his  Ministerial  colleagues,  and  that  his\r\n\r\nresignation  was as a result of the desire  of  my\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  make  him the  scapegoat.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause of that that I feel that the truth  should\r\n\r\nnow be told, not only in regard to the allegations\r\n\r\nthat have been made but also in regard to all  the\r\n\r\npolitical manoeuvrings that have been taking place\r\n\r\nfor  the  past three years, in order  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhealthier,  better  and  non-Communist   form   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Moreover,  Sir,  as  the  time  gets\r\n\r\nnearer  and  nearer towards the general elections,\r\n\r\npolitics tend to get murkier and murkier, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  urge to capture power, it is just regrettable\r\n\r\nthat there are men who are prepared to forget  the\r\n\r\ndecencies of life, the decencies of leadership and\r\n\r\nstoop  to  the extent of doing something which,  I\r\n\r\nmust  confess, was not expected this afternoon.  I\r\n\r\nsay, Sir, let the truth be known once and for all.\r\n\r\nLet  the  people of Singapore wake up to what  has\r\n\r\nbeen going on and let them decide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- and  decide  wisely at the general  elections - so\r\n\r\nthat  the  government that is returned can  be  a\r\n\r\ngovernment that is clean, pure and sincere in  its\r\n\r\nefforts to work for the welfare of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it grieves me to have to say things\r\n\r\nhere which I would not ordinarily have said.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition speakers have forced the pace  and\r\n\r\nforced  the  tone of this debate. When  Mr  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee Kee saw me yesterday morning, he said that he\r\n\r\nwas  prepared to resign from the Assembly and from\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry if I could speak to the  leader  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to see whether all this unnecessary mud-slinging  could be prevented, and if an assurance\r\n\r\ncould  be received from the leader of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  this  motion  would not take  the  trend  it\r\n\r\noriginally intended to take, he would resign. The\r\n\r\nanswer  was  given  in  the affirmative,  and  he\r\n\r\nresigned.   But  this  afternoon,   after   having\r\n\r\nreceived  an  assurance from the hon.  Member  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, the man who hopes to be  the  next\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of this country, what do  we  get?\r\n\r\nAll  this mud-slinging at a man who cannot defend\r\n\r\nhimself,   who   resigned  just  because   of   an\r\n\r\nassurance received from the hon. Member. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  kind of political trickery which we  have  to\r\n\r\ncontend  with at this time when a new constitution\r\n\r\nis to come into force: when complete internal self-government  is  to be given to us  to  guide  this\r\n\r\ncountry  towards prosperity, towards  cleanliness,\r\n\r\ntowards  all that we believe in, all that we  have\r\n\r\nfought for. It is indeed a sad day for me to  have\r\n\r\nto  put  that  faith  in  something  which  I  was\r\n\r\nadvised would never be honoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has now come to the stage, Sir, when it\r\n\r\nis  felt  necessary by the Opposition to try  and\r\n\r\nmake  things  as dirty as they can be  against  my\r\n\r\nloyal  colleagues who have worked  so  hard,  who\r\n\r\nhave fought so vigorously with their hearts, their\r\n\r\nsouls  and  their lives to keep this country  from\r\n\r\nthe grip of Communism, I find that the truth must\r\n\r\nnow  be  told. I am sure the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  have  been  wondering  how  it  was  that  I\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in bringing an All-Party delegation  to\r\n\r\nLondon  and  succeeded in  bringing  home  a  new\r\n\r\nconstitution with the subversive clause. The truth\r\n\r\nshall now be told. If one side can play\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirty and begin to be dirty, I shall play the same\r\n\r\ngame  and do it too, and let the country  and  the\r\n\r\nworld  and  God decide. The subversive clause  was\r\n\r\nput in as a result of the hon.

Member  the  point that he himself  said  in\r\n\r\nmoving  his  motion - when he made such allegations\r\n\r\nand  when  the S.P.A. stated that it was a  stupid\r\n\r\nlie,  and it is because of that refutation it  was\r\n\r\ntrue - according to his reasoning \r\n\r\n- and therefore using his reasoning, what I  said\r\n\r\nand what he said would lead one to believe that it\r\n\r\nmust  have been the truth. But leaving that apart,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  you have so ruled, I must  seek  your\r\n\r\nindulgence  and  the  indulgence  of  this   House\r\n\r\nbecause  I  feel that the time has come  when  the\r\n\r\neyes  of  the  people of Singapore and  the  world\r\n\r\nshould  be  properly opened to all the  intrigues\r\n\r\nthat  have  been going on and on and  on  since  I\r\n\r\nbecame Chief Minister. In saying such things, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  might damn myself, but I am not worried now. As\r\n\r\nChief Minister I am just an individual. As Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock  I  am  still an individual. But the  country\r\n\r\nstands  above all, and if it is going to  be  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the country and, therefore, for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the people of this country,  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  and the Chief Minister can be trampled down,\r\n\r\njust  as  much  as  poor Chew Swee  Kee  is  being\r\n\r\ntrampled  down  when  he is  not  here  to  defend\r\n\r\nhimself.  I  would  like to  say,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been accused of taking very  strong\r\n\r\naction  against subversives, against comrades,  or\r\n\r\nrather  ex-comrades of the People's Action  Party,\r\n\r\nand  that  has  been thrown at me  time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not dismayed because I was doing my duty.\r\n\r\nWhen  I was asked many a time why it was necessary\r\n\r\nthat there should have been so many consultations,\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and friendly meetings with  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust  laughed it off and said: \"Forget  it,  boys!\r\n\r\nThat's nothing.\" Let the truth be told. The action\r\n\r\nthat this Government took against subversives  was\r\n\r\nan  attempt to cleanse the P.A.P. for the good  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. That was what I said. I did it because\r\n\r\nI  felt that it would be in the best interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore if there could be built up\r\n\r\nanother  force  which is dedicated  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the country, which  might  at  that\r\n\r\nparticular time not have awakened to  the  danger\r\n\r\nthat  the  game  that  they  were  playing  was  a\r\n\r\ndangerous game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did so many things for the good of the country.\r\n\r\nI  did  so many things for the good of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nafter discussions with the P.A.P. Such is politics\r\n\r\nin Singapore today!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary, when replying\r\n\r\nto  the  question  raised by the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, said that it was not true that  an\r\n\r\ninquiry  had  been  stopped on the  request  of  a\r\n\r\nMinister.  There  had been no inquiry.  There  was\r\n\r\nconsideration given as to whether or not the funds\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Chew Swee Kee had received came  within\r\n\r\nthe  Income Tax Ordinance, and whether or not such\r\n\r\nfunds  were  subject  to taxation.  There  was  no\r\n\r\ninquiry.  There was no choking-off of an  inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe   hon.  Member  was  not  satisfied,  because,\r\n\r\naccording to him, no man other than he can  speak\r\n\r\nthe  truth. The insinuation is that even the  poor\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary did not speak the truth.  Then\r\n\r\nagain  he  said that we are afraid of a Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry because it will stir up dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been in politics for years and years\r\n\r\nand  years,  and I am just as good a tactician  as\r\n\r\nmany  others. It is my view that, irrespective  of\r\n\r\nthe  merits or demerits of the appointment of such\r\n\r\na  Commission  of  Inquiry, the appointment  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely lead to the disadvantage of  the  Party\r\n\r\nthat  is  being examined. We are having a general\r\n\r\nelection in three months' time, and the Commission\r\n\r\ncannot  wind  up  its  business  so  quickly.  The\r\n\r\ninvestigations  will have to be  done  in  public.\r\n\r\nThere  will have to be almost a running commentary\r\n\r\non what is going on inside the Commission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Inquiry. This will therefore lend extra fuel to\r\n\r\nthe Opposition to hold us up to ridicule. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why we feel that it is not right  that\r\n\r\nwe  should fall into the trap of having to hold  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to go into matters which we\r\n\r\nknow  for sure are not as alleged, although I must\r\n\r\nadmit  that  there were circumstances  surrounding\r\n\r\nsuch    instances   leading   to   the   unfounded\r\n\r\nallegations being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know very little about the source of these\r\n\r\nfunds. But I can say this with all sincerity, that\r\n\r\nthey are not from an American source at all. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  it. I can say this from what  little  I\r\n\r\nknow.  It  is  not  from an American  source.  But\r\n\r\nbefore I go further, Sir, I would like to set  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the  hon. Members of the Opposition  at\r\n\r\nrest, since so much has been said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will accept the motion and appoint a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry. We are not hiding anything. We  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  let the public know to what  extent  the\r\n\r\nallegations made at this late stage are  true;  to\r\n\r\nwhat extent they are just political manoeuverings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S.P.A. has been held up to ridicule by\r\n\r\nthe  previous speakers. It is to be expected  that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  expect  to be well spoken  of  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. We try to do what we can, and what  we\r\n\r\nbelieve is good for the country. We try to keep on\r\n\r\nbuilding up a cohesive organisation, and we  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  not be afraid to  be  held  up  to\r\n\r\nridicule  by  Members of the  Opposition  in  our\r\n\r\ngenuine attempt to find the best way to serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is one of the common failings of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  that,  when  we  try  to  build  up   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic force, all the parts of that democratic\r\n\r\nforce  are not so united. Each force has  its  own\r\n\r\nway  of  thinking, its own line of action and  its\r\n\r\nown beliefs. Therefore, there cannot be that ideal\r\n\r\nstate of united action. Even though we could build\r\n\r\nup  a very strong organisation, there would still\r\n\r\nbe little sprinkiings here and there of so-called\r\n\r\ndemocrats who find that they cannot find a  place\r\n\r\nin  our  organisation. But, Sir,  if  a  political\r\n\r\norganisation is run on the lines of a Party  which\r\n\r\nis Communistic, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  no  need for all these headaches, no need  for\r\n\r\nall   these   attempts  to  bring   about   closer\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  closer unity.  What  the  head\r\n\r\nsays, goes. If it is white, it shall be white even\r\n\r\nthough it may be black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer took this\r\n\r\nmotion  as  an opportunity to smear the reputation\r\n\r\nof  my  Ministerial colleagues, and quite rightly,\r\n\r\nSir,  you  ruled  that  the  amendment  which   he\r\n\r\nproposed  was  not in order. Sir, any  government,\r\n\r\nmay  it  be  the  Government  today  or  the  next\r\n\r\ngovernment - any government - will have to face  such\r\n\r\ncriticism and such attacks. But it is to be hoped\r\n\r\nthat  when attacks of this nature are being  made\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  some sense of proportion,  some\r\n\r\nsense  of appreciation whether or not there  is  a\r\n\r\nbasis for such allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time in all my political\r\n\r\nlife  that I have to stand up in this Chamber  and\r\n\r\nspeak  so  solemnly  and so  sadly  that  a  man's\r\n\r\nbeliefs  in  another man's honesty and  integrity\r\n\r\ncan   be  shattered,  just  because  of  political\r\n\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

One  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure whether the said fund was received  and\r\n\r\nthe  second, is the source of the fund - the  source\r\n\r\nfrom  which  the  fund  was  received.  But  while\r\n\r\nanswering,  the Chief Minister had  just  admitted\r\n\r\nthat  he knew the fund was received. But he doubts\r\n\r\nthe  source  to be from America. That  is  what  I\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that it is also important that we\r\n\r\nmust find out the source - where the fund came from.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know I will be in order if I  move  an\r\n\r\namendment.  To  get the general consent  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  I  will  give  you  the  text  of   the\r\n\r\namendment. May I read it?

Either the P.A.P. is making  a\r\n\r\nfalse  allegation or the S.P.A. is a stooge  party\r\n\r\nof the Americans and is prepared to sell Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  a  certain amount of money. I am not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the allegation is true or false. I only want\r\n\r\nthe  public to know whether there is any political\r\n\r\nParty  which has sold itself to foreign interests,\r\n\r\nor  there  is  a  party which goes  about  telling\r\n\r\nscandalous lies about honest and upright men  like\r\n\r\nour  Chief  Minister. Unless we  decide  that  the\r\n\r\nresults of that Inquiry be made public before  the\r\n\r\nnext  Assembly elections, it is very  unfair  for\r\n\r\nthe  voters of Singapore to know for whom to  vote\r\n\r\nunder this cloud of suspicion. Since this request\r\n\r\nfor the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry is\r\n\r\nmade  in  this House, it is appropriate  that  the\r\n\r\nresults of the Inquiry should also be revealed  in\r\n\r\ntime before the next elections. If the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar is really earnest about his  motion\r\n\r\nand does not want his request for a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  to  languish  in obscurity  after  it  is\r\n\r\npassed,  I  hope  he will have  no  hesitation  in\r\n\r\nsupporting  this  amendment which  seeks  to  give\r\n\r\nteeth to his motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that if the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nhas nothing to fear about this allegation and that\r\n\r\nthere  should be a speedy Inquiry into the serious\r\n\r\nallegation   against   the   Hon.

First,\r\n\r\nlet  us  get  our facts straight. The issue  arose\r\n\r\nover  facts and the Inquiry will be on the facts:\r\n\r\nfirst,  the $500,000 which should be investigated;\r\n\r\nsecond,  the resignation of Mr Chew Swee  Kee.  I\r\n\r\nnever asked Mr Chew Swee Kee to resign. Yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning,  as I was walking into this Chamber,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  asked  me,  \"If  Chew  Swee   Kee\r\n\r\nresigns, will you go soft on him?\" I said,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nit  is  not  for me.

The Member for Sembawang is here to  bear\r\n\r\nwitness   and  several  members  of   my   Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee are also in the  Gallery.  We\r\n\r\nheld a lunchtime meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  decide  the offer of appeasement made  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister on behalf of Mr Chew Swee Kee.  I\r\n\r\ntold  the Chief Minister before lunch that  I  was\r\n\r\nnot  in  a position to decide, and that it  was  a\r\n\r\nmatter for my Chairman. My Chairman decided that,\r\n\r\nalthough he was the person called a liar,  he  was\r\n\r\nnot  in a position to decide either, and we had  a\r\n\r\nCentral Executive Committee meeting at one o'clock\r\n\r\nyesterday which went on to a quarter-past  two.  I\r\n\r\ncame  back  to  this Chamber and  told  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, who was resting in the C.P.A. Room, what\r\n\r\nwas  agreed - that  if Mr Chew  resigned,  then  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be necessary for me to press  for  the\r\n\r\nInquiry,  because then the matter was  admitted;\r\n\r\nbut  that it would be my duty, nevertheless, since\r\n\r\nthe  matter had gone that far, to state the facts.\r\n\r\nI told him that in clear and categorical terms. He\r\n\r\nwas  in  the C.P.A. Room on the adjournment  this\r\n\r\nmorning  when my Chairman. Dr Toh, Dr  Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee,  I  and  the Member for Sembawang  told  him\r\n\r\nclearly that that was the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that I came to\r\n\r\nsee  you  yesterday to make sure that the position\r\n\r\nwas as stated - that Mr Chew had resigned, because\r\n\r\nI told the Chief Minister, \"If Mr Chew is here, I\r\n\r\nmust  pursue the matter to the hilt. If he is  not\r\n\r\nhere,  I am prepared to state the facts,  and  if\r\n\r\nthe  facts  are not challenged, then there  is  no\r\n\r\npoint  for a Commission of Inquiry, be, cause  no\r\n\r\ncrime  has  been  committed but only  a  political\r\n\r\nblunder of the biggest magnitude has been made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I stated must have been too much for\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister. There was only one thing which\r\n\r\nhe did not know, and that is that I had permission\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Hon. the   former   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas)  to\r\n\r\ndisclose  that Mr Chew had told him he  got  U.S.\r\n\r\n$100,000  gold for the Party at the end  of  1957.\r\n\r\nThe Minister told me this only two weeks ago - I  do\r\n\r\nnot  remember  exactly when, but it  was  told  me\r\n\r\nafter I had tabled the motion. He is the only  one\r\n\r\nhonest guy left in the Government, and he told me,\r\n\r\n\"Look, if it is any help, tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

But as\r\n\r\nagainst Mr Chew my Chairman had categorical proof\r\n\r\nand  therefore we went forward when we were called\r\n\r\nliars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the position. My Chairman informed\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister this afternoon, in my presence\r\n\r\nand  in the presence of the Member for Sembawang,\r\n\r\nthat   we  had  to  state  the  facts,  that   his\r\n\r\nresignation does not mean that we have to withdraw\r\n\r\nall  the  charges because they are not necessary.\r\n\r\nThey  have  to  be  stated categorically  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  record,  and  if  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary had looked at file G.S. 47909,\r\n\r\nhe would know that what I stated is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as to the counter-smear. Sir, before I went\r\n\r\nto  London, I thought, \"Oh! The Chief Minister  is\r\n\r\nthe  master plotter in this House.\" He  plots  and\r\n\r\nconspires  with everybody, because he  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncunning  and  a  very wily man. He survived  three\r\n\r\nphases- from  the nominated phase  into  the  first\r\n\r\npartially-elected, and on to  the  Rendel  phase.\r\n\r\nBefore we went to London, we carefully weighed the\r\n\r\nodds,  whether by so doing we would  subsequently\r\n\r\nbe  put in a fix by a possible smear that we  sold\r\n\r\nout  on  our comrades. Sir, he wants at this  late\r\n\r\nstage,  when there is no way out, to smear  me  by\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Ah! I sold out my so-called comrades.  I\r\n\r\nsaw  him  and  agreed the subversive  clause  with\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd at a private meeting.\" Let me tell him\r\n\r\nthis:  I  never,  with him, saw Lennox-Boyd  at  a\r\n\r\nprivate  meeting. I knew, when we were inside  the\r\n\r\nConference Room - the Member for Serangoon was there\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands and Housing - that there were two choices left\r\n\r\nfor me: either  I  broke  up  the Conference  or  I  said,\r\n\r\n\"Reject  the subversive clause and come back.\"  He\r\n\r\nremembered it, because if he wants the  truth  to\r\n\r\nbe  out, let me tell him this: that, in fact, they\r\n\r\nwere  all  in  favour  of it  and  they  tried  to\r\n\r\npersuade  me  to  accept it.  I  said,  \"Under  no\r\n\r\ncircumstances, because I was not in a position  to\r\n\r\naccept any such \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthing  and because my Party members were in gaol.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  whatever  we  do or do not  do,  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain guiding principles we always follow,  and\r\n\r\none  of  them  is: never make a move which  makes\r\n\r\nyou  a  hostage  of another man.  And  if  I  had\r\n\r\naccepted the clause, I would have been a  hostage\r\n\r\nof  chaps  who  were locked up. If I  refused,  I\r\n\r\nmight become a hostage of the people with whom  I\r\n\r\nwas  negotiating. Therefore I came back  and,  on\r\n\r\nthe  slightest challenge, I went and fought  the\r\n\r\npolls.

I  think  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  does  recollect that I  pulled  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  up  when he was on that topic  as  being\r\n\r\nirrelevant and perhaps the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  should be satisfied with his  reply  up  to\r\n\r\nnow. Let us now be relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I just, in passing,\r\n\r\nmention this: that what we do politically, we must\r\n\r\ndo  cleanly and honourably? We are not  afraid  of\r\n\r\nany  inquiry being held, anywhere, any  time,  any\r\n\r\nplace,  on  any one of us, because our  hands  are\r\n\r\nclean.  First  and  last, we  have  financial  and\r\n\r\npolitical   integrity  of  purpose.   They   were\r\n\r\nundecided  on what to do. I knew that  they  were\r\n\r\nplotting.  Now  it  is  too  late  to  close   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - that  is  their biggest  regret.  But  they\r\n\r\nwould  have banged us and closed us down  if  they\r\n\r\nknew  that  we would go from strength to strength.\r\n\r\nIf  they  knew  that, despite the fact  that  they\r\n\r\npulled  away the active C.P. types from the Party,\r\n\r\nthe  Party could still have the momentum  and  the\r\n\r\ndrive  to succeed, they would have closed us  down\r\n\r\nin  August 1957. Sir, I have no illusions on  this\r\n\r\nscore.  The  Chief Minister is a wily  man  and  I\r\n\r\ntreated him on that basis. I say this. The trouble\r\n\r\nwith the Chief Minister is that, although he is  a\r\n\r\nwily man, some of his subordinates are not. One of\r\n\r\nhis subordinates was Mr. de Cruz and he let it  be\r\n\r\nknown  that  it  was the intention of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront to absorb the P.A.P. Therefore, if you  lift\r\n\r\nup all the active C.P. types, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou absorb the democratic element. He knew that we\r\n\r\nwere  not  C.P. types, and yet he carried  out  a\r\n\r\nconsistent  smear  that we are Communists - and  we\r\n\r\nkept      on      saying     we      are      not\r\n\r\nCommunists - deliberately to confuse  the  public.\r\n\r\nThat  was  the reason why he could not close  us,\r\n\r\nbecause   not  only  did  he  know  we  are   not\r\n\r\nCommunists,  but  he  also  knew  that   we   are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  work for a positive  non-Communist\r\n\r\nline.

Let me tell\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister  this:  one  thing  we  never\r\n\r\nunlearn  is  that if you want to be a  force,  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  be clean. Had his group been  clean,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have absorbed them.

They have failed to absorb us.They\r\n\r\nhave failed to block us. When the former Director\r\n\r\nof  the Special Branch decided to scoot, then they\r\n\r\nreally knew that their goose was cooked. I am  not\r\n\r\nafraid  at  any time to be called a non-Communist.\r\n\r\nAt  this  stage, for the Chief Minister to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  I  was fighting the subversives is  a  very\r\n\r\nfoolish  thing,  because that is contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole of his line. I will say this: the reason why\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. survives today is because we have held\r\n\r\na  consistent line. And the reason why the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  collapsed and why the S.P.A. will  collapse\r\n\r\nis  because  it  has no basic beliefs,  no  basic\r\n\r\nline,  nothing to sell; everybody in for  what  he\r\n\r\ncould get out of it - loot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I saw you yesterday and asked you what the\r\n\r\nposition  was with regard to my motion,  since  my\r\n\r\nParty  had agreed that if Mr Chew resigned  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  point  for a Commission of Inquiry.  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister found the facts too  much  because\r\n\r\nthey  told too heavily. He now says he is prepared\r\n\r\nto accept this motion. I had indicated to him that\r\n\r\nafter the debate had taken place, I would withdraw\r\n\r\nmy motion, because it was no longer necessary. He\r\n\r\nsays  he  wants to carry on and accept the motion.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, you told me that if I wanted  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  it, I would have to get the  consent  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.  We  keep our  bargains.  I  still\r\n\r\npropose to withdraw, but there is nothing to  stop\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  on their own, if  they  want  to\r\n\r\nclear   themselves,  from   proceeding   with   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry. I therefore formally, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  ask  your  leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\nmotion, since everybody knows why I am withdrawing\r\n\r\nit.  I  find it serves no useful purpose. We  keep\r\n\r\nour  bargains.  We  do not want to  embarrass  the\r\n\r\nwhole   of   the  Government  as   a   result   of\r\n\r\ninvestigating  Mr  Chew's  affairs.   The   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  knows  exactly how  I  feel  about  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  He knows that this is political dynamite.\r\n\r\nOnce Mr Chew resigned, he admitted his guilt.
