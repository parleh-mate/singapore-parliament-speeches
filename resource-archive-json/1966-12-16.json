However, part-time trained  teachers\r\n\r\nfrom   Government  or  Government-aided   schools,\r\n\r\nbecause   of  their  experience  and  professional\r\n\r\ntraining,  are  retained in  the  Board  to  teach\r\n\r\nsenior  classes, whereas those recruited from  the\r\n\r\nunemployed,   after  they  have  been   given   an\r\n\r\nintensive training course, are teaching  only  the\r\n\r\nSecondary I, II and literacy and language classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to replace all with this\r\n\r\ncategory if the aim is to maintain the standard of\r\n\r\nthe   classes  organised  by  the  Board.  It   is\r\n\r\nenvisaged   that   in  1967  the  scheme   already\r\n\r\nimplemented in the Chinese medium will be  further\r\n\r\nextended  to other language media and  to  recruit\r\n\r\nabout   150  unemployed  who  have  the  necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications  to  teach  in  the  literacy   and\r\n\r\nlanguage classes in the English medium. It is also\r\n\r\nplanned   that   about   45   part-time   clerical\r\n\r\nassistants  now  working in the Board  are  to  be\r\n\r\ngradually replaced by full-time officers recruited\r\n\r\nfrom   the   unemployed  who  have  the  necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

It  is\r\n\r\nstated  that this type of school uniform  is  more\r\n\r\nprogressive than baju kurong. There are others who\r\n\r\nsay that Malay students are Muslims and to put  on\r\n\r\nskirt  and  blouse is forbidden. The  Chairman  of\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O., Singapore, Inche Ahmad Bin Haji Taff, in\r\n\r\nwanting  to  safeguard  the  personality  of   the\r\n\r\nstudents and Malay culture, has resisted the  idea\r\n\r\nof  changing the baju kurong to skirt and  blouse.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my opinion,  whether  the\r\n\r\nstudents are progressive or not does not depend on\r\n\r\ntheir uniform; it does not matter whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  school  uniform is baju kurong or  skirt  and\r\n\r\nblouse.  It  depends on the education imparted  to\r\n\r\nthem  by  the  teachers in  the  schools  and  the\r\n\r\nencouragement  they get to study at home.  Whether\r\n\r\nit  is  acceptable  (halal) or  forbidden  (haram)\r\n\r\ndepends  on each individual. Today there are  many\r\n\r\nMalay   girls  who  put  on  dresses   which   are\r\n\r\ntransparent, and skin tight too. So, in  order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  Malay  culture  and  personality,  does\r\n\r\nInche  Ahmad Haji Taff himself put on baju  kurong\r\n\r\nwhen  he  goes to work in the office? The attitude\r\n\r\nof  this gentleman is like that of the mother crab\r\n\r\nwhich  asks  its  baby to walk straight  when  she\r\n\r\nherself  walks  sideways. It is  better  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion of deciding on the school dress,  whether\r\n\r\nit  is  to be baju kurong or skirt and blouse,  be\r\n\r\nleft to the parents themselves so long as there is\r\n\r\na  distinctive colour in the uniform according  to\r\n\r\nthe  school  the child attends. Also consideration\r\n\r\nshould be given to the extra expenditure that  may\r\n\r\nbe incurred by parents. But what is most important\r\n\r\nis  to look into the matter of the progress of the\r\n\r\nchildren's education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in replying to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang earlier, stated that at the moment there\r\n\r\nare  very few qualified trained Malay teachers  to\r\n\r\nteach in Malay secondary schools. Therefore,  with\r\n\r\nthis shortage, can Malay secondary students become\r\n\r\nmore progressive only by changing their dress from\r\n\r\nbaju  kurong to skirt and blouse? If the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  are  aware of this  shortage,  they\r\n\r\nshould  then find ways and means to overcome  this\r\n\r\nshortage  if they truly wish to see Malay students\r\n\r\nprogress  in  their studies. I still remember  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education during the Government  of\r\n\r\nTun  Lim  Yew  Hock  in  1957  stated  that  Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary schools could not be established because\r\n\r\nthere  were no teachers and no suitable  text-books\r\n\r\nin  Malay.  But when the P.A.P. came to  power  in\r\n\r\n1959, the then Minister for Education, who is  now\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health,  promised  that  Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools would be established  in  1961,\r\n\r\nalthough  he was still facing the same problem  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and textbooks in Malay. But  because  of\r\n\r\nthe keen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffort  put  in,  Malay  secondary  classes   were\r\n\r\nstarted in 1960, that is, one year earlier. If the\r\n\r\npresent  Minister for Education  is  to  wait  for\r\n\r\nqualified teachers in the Malay stream to  descend\r\n\r\nfrom  heaven, and likewise wait for textbooks  to\r\n\r\ndescend  from  heaven, then the intention  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  Malay  education  progresses  will  not   be\r\n\r\nachieved.  I  would like to ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nplans  there are to encourage more Malay  graduate\r\n\r\nteachers, because at present although there are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Malay graduates, they were transferred\r\n\r\nor  ask  for  transfer to other jobs for  specific\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would further like to state\r\n\r\nthat,  at  the moment, there are one or  two  pre-university  classes in the Malay  stream.  If  the\r\n\r\nproblem facing Malay secondary education cannot be\r\n\r\nfaced  by  the  Ministry, what hope is  there  for\r\n\r\nthose  in  the pre-university classes?  What  will\r\n\r\nhappen  to  those  students who  wish  to  go  for\r\n\r\nfurther studies? Does the Ministry have any  plans\r\n\r\nto overcome this problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding vocational education in the Malay\r\n\r\nstream,  I  find that it is important to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of vocational schools  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nstream  so  as  to  give  opportunities  to  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  to  study  in the vocational  stream  in\r\n\r\norder  that they will be well equipped to work  in\r\n\r\nfactories   and  industries  which  need   skilled\r\n\r\nworkers. I hope the Minister will see to  it  that\r\n\r\nvocational   schools  in  the  Malay   stream   be\r\n\r\nincreased  so as to enable Malay students  to  get\r\n\r\nvocational training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding text-books, I have received complaints\r\n\r\nthat  certain schools change text-books from  year\r\n\r\nto  year. This causes difficulties to parents  who\r\n\r\nhave  two  or  more children in the  same  school,\r\n\r\nwhereas  it  is  the  policy of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to provide opportunities  for  them  to\r\n\r\ngive   their   children  adequate  education.   If\r\n\r\ntextbooks are changed from year to year, this will\r\n\r\nbe a problem to the parents, because the textbooks\r\n\r\nwhich  could  have been handed down to  the  other\r\n\r\nchildren  cannot  be  handed  down.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nefforts will be made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto see that textbooks in the schools could be used\r\n\r\nin a manner that would not bring difficulty to the\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, education is\r\n\r\nessential  in any society. In a developing  multi-racial,  multi-lingual, multi-religious  socialist\r\n\r\nsociety like ours, however, education is called on\r\n\r\nto  do  more than just training our young.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso   called  on  to  make  us  good  and  useful\r\n\r\ncitizens, to weld our nation together. In the past\r\n\r\nwe  lived not as a nation. We could not have  done\r\n\r\nthat  because we were then a subject race. In  the\r\n\r\npast we lived in separate communities. Things  are\r\n\r\nnow  different.  We  are now independent  and  our\r\n\r\ndestiny  is  in our own hands. We are  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  our  own  future. We are,  however,  a  small\r\n\r\nnation  living on a small island with  no  natural\r\n\r\nresources. The only resources that we can boast of\r\n\r\nare  our  own  people our skill  in  training,  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and in other fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of education, therefore, should be to\r\n\r\ntrain and nurture these skills to make us good and\r\n\r\nuseful  citizens.  Education,  however,  does  not\r\n\r\nconsist of cramming up all the facts that  we  can\r\n\r\nlay  our hands on - in being what we call a  book-worm or a walking dictionary. The aim of education\r\n\r\nis  to make us a complete man, a man who can think\r\n\r\nand act for himself, a man with a disciplined mind\r\n\r\nand  a  healthy body. We can only achieve this  by\r\n\r\ntwo   branches  of  education,  namely,   literary\r\n\r\neducation  and  physical education.  In  the  very\r\n\r\nrecent  past,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  was  defective  to  the  extent  that   we\r\n\r\nattached  far  too  much  importance  to  literary\r\n\r\neducation  and not enough importance  to  physical\r\n\r\neducation.  A devotion to one branch of  education\r\n\r\nto  the  exclusion of the other branch  would  not\r\n\r\nserve   the   purpose  of  education.  Unmitigated\r\n\r\nattention  to  physical  education,  for  example,\r\n\r\nwould produce a sort of ferocity in us, a sort  of\r\n\r\nuncivilised harshness that we should avoid. On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  a mere literary education  makes  us\r\n\r\nsoft  and  dispirited, something that is not  good\r\n\r\nfor us. Ferocity, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the outcome\r\n\r\nof  the  spirited  element in us. Proper  training\r\n\r\nwould produce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourage. But if that element is over-strained,  it\r\n\r\nnaturally becomes hard and savage. Gentleness,  on\r\n\r\nthe   other   hand,  is  characteristic   of   the\r\n\r\nphilosophic  disposition.  Here  again,  too  much\r\n\r\nrelaxation will result in over-softness. The right\r\n\r\ntraining would produce a gentleness that is steady\r\n\r\nand disciplined. We all know the saying: \"All work\r\n\r\nand no play makes Jack a dull boy.\" All class-work\r\n\r\nand  no field activity would, therefore, take away\r\n\r\nthe  high  spirit that is in us and will  make  us\r\n\r\nweak  and  unstable, bad tempered and peevish.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, there are consequences  of  hard\r\n\r\nbodily exercise and high living with no attempt to\r\n\r\ncultivate the mind or use the intellect in  study.\r\n\r\nAt first the sense of physical fitness fills a man\r\n\r\nwith  self-confidence  and energy  and  makes  him\r\n\r\ntwice  the man he is. But suppose he does  nothing\r\n\r\nelse  and  holds himself aloof from  any  sort  of\r\n\r\nculture?  Then even if there is something  in  him\r\n\r\nthat  is  capable  of desiring  knowledge,  he  is\r\n\r\nstarved of instruction and is never encouraged  to\r\n\r\nthink  for  himself  by taking  part  in  rational\r\n\r\ndiscussions or intellectual pursuits of any  kind.\r\n\r\nAnd  so his mind grows feeble for lack of stimulus\r\n\r\nand  nourishment, and deaf and blind  because  the\r\n\r\ndarkness  that clouds perception is never  cleared\r\n\r\naway. Such a man ends by being wholly uncultivated\r\n\r\nand   a  hater  of  reason.  Flaying  no  use  for\r\n\r\nreasonable  persuasion, he gains all his  ends  by\r\n\r\nsavage violence, like a brute, and he lives  in  a\r\n\r\ndull  stupor of ignorance with no touch of  inward\r\n\r\nharmony or grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am supported\r\n\r\nby good authority and, with your permission, may I\r\n\r\nquote from the Republic of Plato on \"the Education\r\n\r\nfor  the  Guardians\". This is the Conford Edition, Mr Speaker, Sir, at page 99 - middle of the page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are then these two elements in the soul -\r\n\r\nthe  spirited and the philosophic. And it  is  for\r\n\r\ntheir   sake,  as  should  say,  and  not  (except\r\n\r\nincidentally)  for the sake of the soul  and  body\r\n\r\nthat  heaven  has  given  to  mankind  these   two\r\n\r\nbranches of education. The purpose is to bring the\r\n\r\ntwo  elements  into  tune  with  one  another   by\r\n\r\nadjusting the tension of each to the right  pitch.\r\n\r\nSo  one  who can apply to the soul both  kinds  of\r\n\r\neducation blended in perfect proportion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  master  of  a nobler  sort  of  musical\r\n\r\nharmony  than was ever made by tuning the  strings\r\n\r\nof the lyre.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in our education system  we  must  not\r\n\r\nonly  concentrate on literary education  but  also\r\n\r\nconcentrate on what Plato calls, and I think it is\r\n\r\ngenerally  called,  physical  education.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I inquire of the\r\n\r\nEducation Minister what has happened to  the  idea\r\n\r\nof  setting  up an elite school? This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant subject and perhaps Members here will be\r\n\r\ngiven   an  opportunity  to  consider  fully   the\r\n\r\nquestion before this elite school is set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note in the Budget that as usual\r\n\r\nEducation  has taken a lion's share in the  coming\r\n\r\nyear's  expenditure.  It is also  noted  that  the\r\n\r\nemphasis is now shifting from primary education to\r\n\r\nsecondary education. In this connection, it may be\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  ask the Education Minister  whether,\r\n\r\nand  if  so  when, he would take steps to  provide\r\n\r\nfree secondary education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> That\r\n\r\nmay mean more taxes, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On the question of primary\r\n\r\neducation,  Sir,  it  is  noted  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\ncompulsory,  as was remarked by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth.

In this connection, the  role\r\n\r\nof  our  teachers and principals cannot  be  over-emphasised. I have come to understand that once  a\r\n\r\nteacher becomes a principal, he tends to lose  all\r\n\r\ncontact with the classrooms and his students  whom\r\n\r\nhe  is  supposed  to  lead and  inspire  with  his\r\n\r\nleadership. Instead he is bogged down  with  paper\r\n\r\nwork  by  the Ministry which tends to  reduce  him\r\n\r\nmore or less to a chief clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that most of the principal's work is\r\n\r\nto   transmit  instructions  received   from   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  teachers  and report  for  frivolous\r\n\r\nreasons  personally to the Ministry. Letters  sent\r\n\r\nby principals to the Ministry often do not receive\r\n\r\nproper   attention  or,  in  certain  cases,   the\r\n\r\nprincipals  themselves dare  not  write  a  second\r\n\r\nreminder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of the large schools, principals and\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants,  who are  usually  highly-paid\r\n\r\nDivision I officers and experienced teachers, have\r\n\r\nto  spend  most of their time doing clerical  work\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be  done  by Division  III  clerical\r\n\r\nofficers.  How then can we expect our  principals,\r\n\r\nwho are no more than mere transmitting agents,  to\r\n\r\nbe  positive in their approach, to be creative and\r\n\r\ninspire those who are under their care?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister for Education to\r\n\r\nconduct a survey to find out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  many  principals  and  senior  assistants  of\r\n\r\nschools  have  to  devote their time  to  clerical\r\n\r\nwork,   and  how  much  of  this  work  could   be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by a clerk or an executive officer.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that  all  principals  of  schools\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to teach at least one period  a\r\n\r\nday  in  the classes. This arrangement will enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  keep  in touch with students  and  truly\r\n\r\nassess   the  progress  of  the  school  and   the\r\n\r\ndirection it is heading. By keeping in touch  with\r\n\r\ntheir  class-room conditions, they will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter   position  to  understand  the  needs   of\r\n\r\nteachers  and the general attitude and outlook  of\r\n\r\nthe student body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also understood that some of the problems\r\n\r\nof    principals   stem   from   an    inequitable\r\n\r\ndistribution  of teachers to schools.  While  some\r\n\r\nschools have too many teachers, thus enabling  the\r\n\r\nteachers  to  have too many free  periods  a  day,\r\n\r\nother schools are not adequately staffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nto  give serious thought to this matter and revise\r\n\r\nthe  system so that principals of schools will  be\r\n\r\nin  a  position to keep in touch with the students\r\n\r\nand   project  much-needed  character   into   the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  all know  that  the  vote  for\r\n\r\neducation is the largest for next year. I have two\r\n\r\nsuggestions   to  make  regarding  education   and\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is about the post allowance for\r\n\r\nprincipals - in other words, this allowance is  to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to look after their schools  better.\r\n\r\nBut,  in  actual  fact, the  result  is  just  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, because once a principal gets a handsome\r\n\r\npay with an additional post allowance, he will not\r\n\r\nlike  to lose his job and he will not like to take\r\n\r\nsteps to get rid of anti-national elements in  his\r\n\r\nschool.  He will appease these elements  and  will\r\n\r\nnot take action against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. The Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  not quite efficient in  controlling\r\n\r\nthe  purchase and sale of text-books  through  the\r\n\r\nprincipals - the Member for Kampong  Kembangan  has\r\n\r\nraised the question of the purchase of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  text-books - because they  are  allowed  a\r\n\r\ncertain  percentage of commission on the  purchase\r\n\r\nof text-books. This means that they can make money\r\n\r\nout  of such transactions and they, therefore,  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  the  text-books to remain unchanged.  A\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of  them just  try  to  obtain  a\r\n\r\ncommission  on  the bills sent by the  sellers  of\r\n\r\ntext-books  without even looking into the  details\r\n\r\nor  taking  the  trouble to find out  whether  the\r\n\r\nbooks  are worth the money. This does no  good  to\r\n\r\nour  education and nation. Why should we then give\r\n\r\nsuch  a  big vote to education and waste  so  much\r\n\r\nallowance on the principals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I\r\n\r\nam  an  ex-principal, I think what the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  has  said  needs  a  little  bit   of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my 16 years in school, I must say that I have\r\n\r\nnot  known of a single principal in English medium\r\n\r\nschools  who  had  anything to do  with  bookshops\r\n\r\npaying him a percentage. It might have happened in\r\n\r\nChinese schools - and I must say that I have heard\r\n\r\nof that but not in English medium schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, our nation lays great  emphasis  on\r\n\r\neducation. This can be seen especially when we are\r\n\r\nconducting  every  year  primary  school  combined\r\n\r\nexaminations   and   secondary   school   combined\r\n\r\nexaminations  with  the  object  of  checking  the\r\n\r\nprogress of students. This is very good. But if it\r\n\r\nis   too  good,  then,  of  course,  it  will   be\r\n\r\nexcessive. There are principals of certain schools\r\n\r\nwho  are  really not good. Although some  students\r\n\r\nobtain  over 60 per cent marks, they are asked  to\r\n\r\nleave  school to ensure that the school can get  a\r\n\r\nbetter    pass   percentage   in   the    combined\r\n\r\nexaminations.  What  is the  reason  for  this?  I\r\n\r\ncannot understand it. If the students of a certain\r\n\r\nschool  get  worse  results than  those  of  other\r\n\r\nschools, then there may be some reason for getting\r\n\r\nrid of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member opposite me said that he had\r\n\r\nbeen a principal. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  teaching in Indonesia before, and almost half\r\n\r\nof  the  students in my class could  not  pass  an\r\n\r\nexamination. I gave them extra tuition and many of\r\n\r\nthem  managed to become good students.  So  it  is\r\n\r\nagainst   the  principle  of  education  to   sack\r\n\r\nstudents  for  poor  results,  more  so  as  these\r\n\r\nstudents  have around 65 per cent marks, just  for\r\n\r\nprestige.  You do not have to spend more  time  on\r\n\r\nthe clever students. The bad students need more of\r\n\r\nthe  teacher's time and energy. So I hope that the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education will pay more attention  to\r\n\r\nthis  and direct principals of schools not to sack\r\n\r\nsuch  students. We should not chase  them  out  of\r\n\r\nschool  but  we should ask them to come  back  and\r\n\r\nimprove their education so that they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  get  70, 80 or 90 per cent marks.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nright to ask students to leave school so that  the\r\n\r\nschool  can improve its passing percentage in  the\r\n\r\ncombined  examinations,  and  therefore  does  not\r\n\r\ncompare badly with other schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

My first\r\n\r\npoint  is  this. I believe it is our intention  to\r\n\r\nhold the Secondary IV (English stream) examination\r\n\r\nand  mark the papers locally. This examination  is\r\n\r\ncommonly known as the Cambridge School Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination.    Some   time    ago,    we    heard\r\n\r\npronouncements about the setting  up  of  a  Local\r\n\r\nExaminations Syndicate, but up to now this has not\r\n\r\nmaterialised.  I would like to know whether  plans\r\n\r\nare already under way to carry out such a project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in respect of the way the\r\n\r\nPrimary School Leaving Examination is held. Papers\r\n\r\nare given to Primary VI students requiring them to\r\n\r\nchoose  the  correct  answer  from  several  given\r\n\r\nanswers.  I think this system is not a sound  one,\r\n\r\nbecause a student who does not know the correct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer can simply make a wild guess. I have  heard\r\n\r\nof  cases where students simply cast lots for  the\r\n\r\nanswers. I wish to suggest that another system  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  whereby school-leavers in the  primary\r\n\r\nstream  will be examined and tested on  what  they\r\n\r\nhave studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is this. I suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned that the entire school curriculum should\r\n\r\nbe  revised. We are a young independent nation and\r\n\r\nit is our intention to give equal opportunities to\r\n\r\none  and  all, irrespective of race,  language  or\r\n\r\nreligion.   Sir,   in   view   of   the    changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances and our objective to build a  robust\r\n\r\nand   rugged  society  within  the  framework   of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialist  principles,  I  think   the\r\n\r\nentire  school  curriculum  should  be  thoroughly\r\n\r\nrevised  and that a committee, comprising  eminent\r\n\r\neducationists, be set up so as to work out  a  new\r\n\r\ncurriculum  for all schools. By that, I  am  sure,\r\n\r\nSir, our objectives will be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I just want to take up one point.\r\n\r\nThe  hon. Member for Punggol has talked about  the\r\n\r\nPrimary School Leaving Examination. Because I  was\r\n\r\nclosely   connected  with  the  running  of   that\r\n\r\nexamination  for  several years,  I  know  how  it\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I am surprised when the Member says that\r\n\r\nthe  objective  type of examination  is  not  good\r\n\r\nbecause the students tend to just toss a coin  and\r\n\r\nare sure to get a certain number of answers right.\r\n\r\nThe  objective  test  is  actually  considered  by\r\n\r\nleading educationists in the world as the sure way\r\n\r\nof  finding out what children know. In the marking\r\n\r\nof a paper, for example, if there are 80 questions\r\n\r\nset  and  there  are 4 possible  answers  to  each\r\n\r\nquestion  given, if a child were to put down  just\r\n\r\n\"(1) \",  \"(1) \", \"(1) \", and so on as the answers  to\r\n\r\nall  the  80 questions, well, he will get only  20\r\n\r\nmarks,   i.e, one-quarter.  But  in  the   actual\r\n\r\ncomputation  of  the  results,  he  gets  a  zero;\r\n\r\nbecause  if he gets 20 marks, it is equivalent  to\r\n\r\n0.  Anyway,  the system takes too long to  explain\r\n\r\nhere,  but in the marking system where a boy  were\r\n\r\nto  try  that sort of trick, he would get actually\r\n\r\nnothing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I subscribe\r\n\r\nfully  to  all  the  sentiments expressed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang, in particular, that  the\r\n\r\naim  of  education should be to produce a complete\r\n\r\nman,  literate as well as healthy. On the  aim  of\r\n\r\neducation I do not think there is any controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is not really a very controversial subject. The\r\n\r\narguments  centre round how best  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\naim.  In  my  view,  if you want  to  produce  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  man, one who is literate  and  sound  in\r\n\r\nhealth, it depends on the system of education, the\r\n\r\nprincipal, the teachers, the family and  the  home\r\n\r\nenvironment. Whatever sound educational system  we\r\n\r\nmight devise, if the principal and the teachers do\r\n\r\nnot understand the aim and are not prepared to put\r\n\r\nin the effort, then it will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that matter that we are organising a\r\n\r\nseminar of principals sometime towards the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  month with a view to getting suggestions from\r\n\r\nthem, and hoping in the process that they will  be\r\n\r\neducated also!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the elite school.

If  that happens, then  I  think  that\r\n\r\nprincipal  is  not fit to hold that  post  and  he\r\n\r\nshould  vacate it to make way for a more competent\r\n\r\nperson  to be the principal. As for the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat the principal should be asked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto teach at least a period a day, I think it is  a\r\n\r\nsound  suggestion and I shall certainly look  into\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of principals changing school text-books year after year can only be resolved if the\r\n\r\nparents will cooperate with the Ministry, and also\r\n\r\nif the principals will be more responsible and not\r\n\r\nsuccumb  to the temptation of commissions  offered\r\n\r\nto  them  by the booksellers. The present practice\r\n\r\nis  that  a  school  should not change  text-books\r\n\r\nevery  year,  but that a change can only  be  made\r\n\r\nafter  three  years and after sound  reasons  have\r\n\r\nbeen  advanced  for the proposed change  of  text-books.  If the Member for Paya Lebar can  tell  me\r\n\r\nwho  is the principal who changes text-books every\r\n\r\nyear, I shall certainly deal with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Kampong Kembangan, the\r\n\r\nchange of school uniform from the baju kurong  and\r\n\r\nsarong  to  blouse  and skirt  is  voluntary.  The\r\n\r\npupils  or the parents are not compelled  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  change if they do not want to. The suggestion\r\n\r\nwas made because it was found from experience that\r\n\r\nthe  baju  kurong and sarong uniform hinders  free\r\n\r\nmovement during physical education - games. And if\r\n\r\nwe want to produce a robust and rugged generation,\r\n\r\nit is necessary that more emphasis should be given\r\n\r\nto  physical training, sports and games. It is for\r\n\r\nthat reason that the suggestion was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not compulsory if the parents refuse to\r\n\r\nallow their children to put on blouse and skirt. I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that just by changing to blouse  and\r\n\r\nskirt, the traditional culture of the Malays  will\r\n\r\nbe  destroyed. There are many instances  in  other\r\n\r\nMuslim  countries  where they put  on  blouse  and\r\n\r\nskirt  but they are still a powerful nation;  they\r\n\r\nstill  have their own national identity and  their\r\n\r\nown culture. Therefore, the argument that just  by\r\n\r\nchanging the baju kurong and sarong to blouse and,\r\n\r\nskirt,  the culture of the race will be  destroyed\r\n\r\nis not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay pre-university students can be admitted to\r\n\r\nthe   Malay  Studies  Department  either  at   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore  or  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  also  enrol for professional courses  at  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic in the same way as the Chinese  medium\r\n\r\nH.S.C. classes if they have an adequate knowledge\r\n\r\nof  a  second language, which is English  in  this\r\n\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there is a shortage of graduate\r\n\r\nMalay  teachers  to undertake the Secondary  Malay\r\n\r\nmedium  classes. The Ministry has been trying  its\r\n\r\nbest  to  increase the supply by offering generous\r\n\r\nbursaries  and scholarships to Malay students  who\r\n\r\nare  qualified  for admission to  the  university.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we have provided free education  for\r\n\r\nMalays  from  the  primary up  to  the  university\r\n\r\nlevel. In addition, other bursaries and free text-books  are  provided. We hope that by  this  means\r\n\r\nthere will be a greater number of Malays who  will\r\n\r\nstay  in school up to university level.

But when  it\r\n\r\nwas  time for the Bukit Timah by-election to  take\r\n\r\nplace,  and it was decided by the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  to  field Mr Chor Yeok Eng as a candidate,\r\n\r\nit  was necessary for him then to resign from  the\r\n\r\nservice   of   the  Government  as  my   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary. With his return unopposed, I put to the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister the question of his  reappointment\r\n\r\neither   as  a  Political  Secretary   or   as   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary. It was then  decided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister that Mr Chor could be another\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary. It was,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of the Prime Minister that Mr Chor Yeok\r\n\r\nEng  be made a Parliamentary Secretary. Therefore,\r\n\r\nhe was posted to the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the two Members concerned are not aware\r\n\r\nof  the fact that the preparation of the Estimates\r\n\r\ntakes as much as eight months before it could find\r\n\r\nitself in print. In fact, at this very moment, all\r\n\r\nMinistries  are working on the 1968 Estimates.  So\r\n\r\nalthough   the  post  of  a  second  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  may  not appear in the 1967  Estimates,\r\n\r\nall  that  is  necessary  for,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance and Treasury to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo is to agree to an application for supplementary\r\n\r\nestimates. I can only assume that so long  as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  Parliamentary Secretary gets  his  salary,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the Treasury has already approved  his\r\n\r\npost.

Firstly, I wish  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health why there is a difference\r\n\r\nin  the  publication of the results of the tenders\r\n\r\nfor  drugs  and  pharmaceutical products  for  his\r\n\r\nMinistry.   All  other  Government   tenders   are\r\n\r\npublished  in  full  with the  quotations  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  tenderer  and  those  of   the   other\r\n\r\ntenderers,  whereas in respect of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  the individual items of quotation are  not\r\n\r\nstated in the Government Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item I wish to raise is the open sale\r\n\r\nof  harmful drugs in shops which is not under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of pharmacists or doctors. I am referring\r\n\r\nto pep pills which are openly sold in shops. These\r\n\r\npills are reputed to restore energy and act  as  a\r\n\r\nstimulant.  They are taken mostly  by  youths  who\r\n\r\nwish to remain awake in the night. I was told that\r\n\r\nthese  pills  are very harmful and once  a  person\r\n\r\ntakes  them,  he becomes an addict.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthere  are cases of people taking these pills  who\r\n\r\nhave gone to Woodbridge Hospital. I would ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to look into this matter as  unless  the\r\n\r\nsale of these drugs is stopped, it may affect  our\r\n\r\nyouths.  I  understand no action  is  being  taken\r\n\r\nbecause the Ministry of Health feels that this  is\r\n\r\na  matter  for the Customs. I believe the  Customs\r\n\r\nfeels  this is a matter for the police. The matter\r\n\r\nis going round in circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nquite able to answer the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for River Valley in respect of  his  first\r\n\r\nquestion,  when he states that he does not  appear\r\n\r\nto  find in the Government Gazette the publication\r\n\r\nof tenders for the supply of drugs to my Ministry.\r\n\r\nI  would consider that rather odd if that  is  not\r\n\r\ndone.  If  it  is  the case of not providing  full\r\n\r\nparticulars of the successful tender,  then  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  reason for it. It is not  possible  to\r\n\r\nitemise   every  tender  that  has  been  awarded,\r\n\r\nbecause  certain  tenders amount to  hundreds  and\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars and cover a variety of items.\r\n\r\nI  would  say that, in principle, it is  desirable\r\n\r\nand necessary that when Government Ministries make\r\n\r\npurchases of articles or drugs where they are  put\r\n\r\nto  open tender, the results of such award  should\r\n\r\nbe  publicised in the Government Gazette.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember could give me further information later  on\r\n\r\non this subject and if there is any deficiency,  I\r\n\r\nshall see to it that it will be rectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second point, he feels that there should\r\n\r\nbe  some form of control on what he calls the sale\r\n\r\nof  dangerous drugs by indicating that  pep  pills\r\n\r\nare dangerous drugs. I would like to be guided  by\r\n\r\nprofessional officers in this respect.  If  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  there  are those  who,  having  had  a\r\n\r\nsurfeit  of  pep  pills,  have  been  admitted  to\r\n\r\nWoodbridge  Hospital,  I  am  confident  that   my\r\n\r\ndoctors in Woodbridge Hospital would be the  first\r\n\r\nto  raise  this  point with the Ministry  and,  on\r\n\r\nreceipt  of their advice, action would follow.  If\r\n\r\nit  is  true that the control of the sale  of  pep\r\n\r\npills by unauthorised persons in Singapore is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  made the subject of passing the  buck  from\r\n\r\none  Ministry to another, from the Customs to  the\r\n\r\npolice,  and  from the police to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth and so on, then I will certainly look  into\r\n\r\nit and ensure that at least the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nwill  make  up its mind whether or not control  is\r\n\r\nreally   necessary  with  the  present  state   of\r\n\r\nknowledge that we have of the pep pills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> In view of the explanation, I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

They are\r\n\r\nhighly commendable. However, we must not say  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  no  defects. Whenever we  detect  some\r\n\r\ndefects,  I hope the Minister will take  steps  to\r\n\r\nremedy them so that our health services will reach\r\n\r\na stage of perfection as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know and appreciate that the work in the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  apart  from that of  the  doctors,  is\r\n\r\npassed  over  to the nurses and other  attendants.\r\n\r\nComparatively speaking, it is the nurses  who  are\r\n\r\nin  close  contact with the patients. Because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  illness,  some  patients  are  particularly\r\n\r\ngrumpy.  This  is,  of  course,  inevitable.   The\r\n\r\nservices  performed by nurses are  different  from\r\n\r\nthose performed by other public servants. In other\r\n\r\nwords,    when    they   have    accepted    their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  as  nurses, they  must  appreciate\r\n\r\ntheir  role which is quite extraordinary and  more\r\n\r\nresponsible  than  that  of  the  ordinary  public\r\n\r\nservant. They must pay special attention to  their\r\n\r\npatients. The life of the patients depends on  the\r\n\r\nnurses   who   must  serve  them   carefully   and\r\n\r\npatiently. But because of certain grumpy patients,\r\n\r\nsome  nurses  cannot do their work in  a  kind  or\r\n\r\npatient  manner. Because of this,  these  patients\r\n\r\nare dissatisfied with their services. These nurses\r\n\r\nhave  not  shown enough tolerance and kindness  to\r\n\r\nthe  patients who, in turn, will make  complaints,\r\n\r\nsometimes  to Members of Parliament and  sometimes\r\n\r\nto  other departments of Government. Of course, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  say  for a moment that this situation  is\r\n\r\nwidespread. It is not. But whether it is  or  not,\r\n\r\nwe can still say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  from  the  complaints  made  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  nothing seems to have  improved  very\r\n\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Member for Moulmein last year\r\n\r\ndid  make  a complaint to the department concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  discourtesy  of  some  nurses  towards\r\n\r\npatients or other members of the public who sought\r\n\r\nhelp  from the hospitals. At that time, I remember\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary replied that  because\r\n\r\nthe  complaints from the public and patients  were\r\n\r\nunspecified - no names were given, no descriptions\r\n\r\nof  the nurses were given the department concerned\r\n\r\nwas  unable  to  take any action. So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will pay attention to what I am going  to\r\n\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is whether some measures may be\r\n\r\ntaken to give a number to each and every nurse  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  other words,  something  like  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  shown on the police constables' uniforms.\r\n\r\nSay, in group one you can have \"E\" or \"B\" or other\r\n\r\nidentification numbers which may be  used  on  the\r\n\r\nnurses' uniforms. I do not think this will present\r\n\r\nany  difficulty. If you have these  identification\r\n\r\nnumbers  on  the uniforms of nurses, then  persons\r\n\r\nwho  want  to make complaints against the culprits\r\n\r\ncan  take  down  the numbers for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nrecord and make their complaints. This will enable\r\n\r\nthe  department  concerned to take  the  necessary\r\n\r\naction against the culprits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is another point worthy\r\n\r\nof  consideration. With the numbers shown  on  the\r\n\r\nuniforms,  the nurses will realise that those  who\r\n\r\nhave made mistakes will be punished and those  who\r\n\r\nare good will be praised by members of the public.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would like the Minister to see to  it  that\r\n\r\nrecord books are placed in each and every ward  of\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals  so  that patients  are  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to say good things of the good  nurses\r\n\r\nand  make  complaints against the bad nurses,  and\r\n\r\nawards or punishment may be meted out accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I agree with her that one should\r\n\r\nnever  be  satisfied  with conditions  and  should\r\n\r\nalways  attempt  to improve; especially  if  there\r\n\r\nshould be any deficiencies, we should endeavour to\r\n\r\nrectify them. It is only in this way that  we  can\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has spoken largely on the role of\r\n\r\nnurses,  but she has been good enough to say  that\r\n\r\nnot  all nurses are unkind. So here again  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with the subject of the minority  of  any\r\n\r\ncommunity  who  may  not  live  up  to  the   high\r\n\r\ntraditions of this noble vocation of nursing.  She\r\n\r\nmakes  the suggestion that nurses should be  asked\r\n\r\nto put on a number like that of police constables,\r\n\r\nso that it will be easy for identification in case\r\n\r\nof  complaints. But she is also wise enough to say\r\n\r\nthat  it is also possible for a patient to be able\r\n\r\nto remember the number of the nurse who has looked\r\n\r\nafter him very well, so that there will either  be\r\n\r\na  bouquet or a brickbat. This is a question which\r\n\r\nI  believe has been discussed with A.U.P.E., which\r\n\r\nrepresents   the  nurses,  and  I  am   given   to\r\n\r\nunderstand that there is some resistance  to  even\r\n\r\nhaving  names  attached to  the  lapels  of  their\r\n\r\nuniforms.  I  personally  think  it  is   a   good\r\n\r\nsuggestion to have tag names on uniforms.  We  are\r\n\r\nalready  making  a start with the doctors,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to pursue this matter in  respect  of\r\n\r\nnurses  with a different colour - one  colour  for\r\n\r\ndoctors  and a different colour for nurses.

We can even claim that it is among  the\r\n\r\nbest  in  Asian countries. The outpatient services\r\n\r\nprovided in the various districts are very helpful\r\n\r\nto  citizens. The Ministry of Health has not  only\r\n\r\nbrought medical services to the doorsteps  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  but these outpatient services  have  also\r\n\r\nrelieved congestion in the General Hospital  where\r\n\r\nemergency  cases  could be dealt with  efficiently\r\n\r\nand   quickly.   But  in  spite   of   all   these\r\n\r\nimprovements, there are certain points I  wish  to\r\n\r\nbring  to  the kind attention of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a letter dated 21st July, 1966,\r\n\r\nsigned by one Dr Ho Guan Lim, Deputy Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical  Services  (Hospitals),  replying   to   a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  I  made on 18th July, 1966.  My  letter\r\n\r\ncomplained  of  a  rusty nail found  in  the  food\r\n\r\nserved to a patient in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\r\n\r\nSir,   in   his  reply  the  D.D.M.S.  (Hospitals)\r\n\r\nregretted  that  such  a thing  had  happened  and\r\n\r\npromised  that he would tell the hospitals  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  careful in the preparation of food. While  I\r\n\r\nappreciate this act of the D.D.M.S. (Hospitals). I\r\n\r\nhave to quote the second paragraph of the reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I do not think this was deliberate.

The doctors could  be  said\r\n\r\nto  be  heads of the various departments and  they\r\n\r\nacted  like  emperors. They were very pompous  and\r\n\r\nthe patients regarded them with fear. They did not\r\n\r\npay  attention  to the patients. On the  contrary,\r\n\r\nthe  patients  were ridiculed and neglected.  This\r\n\r\nsort  of  situation prevailed in the old  colonial\r\n\r\ndays, but it was wiped out when the P.A.P. came to\r\n\r\npower   in  1959.  The  situation  now  is   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent. But, unfortunately, it is not  manifest\r\n\r\nin  all the hospitals. Some staff in the hospitals\r\n\r\nhave  again adopted the colonial type of  attitude\r\n\r\nwhich   prevailed  before.  They   ill-treat   the\r\n\r\npatients and adopt a contemptuous attitude towards\r\n\r\nthem.  There  have  been many such  complaints.  I\r\n\r\nmyself  have  received quite  a  number  of  them,\r\n\r\nespecially  from the poorer people  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  These people seek treatment in  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals.  Contrary to their  expectations,  they\r\n\r\nare  ill-treated and suffer mental cruelty at  the\r\n\r\nhands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  certain staff in the hospitals. As they are in\r\n\r\nneed  of medical attention, there is no other  way\r\n\r\nout for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several suggestions to make in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The  treatment\r\n\r\nmeted out to certain patients is rather unfair. We\r\n\r\nhave  read in the Press and also heard a lot about\r\n\r\nthe  ill-treatment meted out by the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital  staff.  Even  my  wife  has  experienced\r\n\r\nmaltreatment  in  that  hospital.  This  is   very\r\n\r\nregrettable  and is the cause of  my  anger.  This\r\n\r\nwill  cast  an  aspersion on the  white  angels  -\r\n\r\nnamely, the nurses in the Kandang Kerbau Hospital!\r\n\r\nLet  me  give some examples. This year, a pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman was warded there and she was in great labour\r\n\r\npains.  She was yelling for her papa and mama  and\r\n\r\nthe  nurse  cursed  her  saying,  \"When  you  feel\r\n\r\npleasant and happy, you do not shout for your papa\r\n\r\nand mama. Why do you now call for them?\" This is a\r\n\r\nvery  awkward situation. When she felt the  labour\r\n\r\npangs -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But  the\r\n\r\nnurse  told her, \"You have given birth to so  many\r\n\r\nbabies. Do you not know that this is not the  time\r\n\r\nfor  you to deliver?\" It was only when the patient\r\n\r\nshouted,  \"The  head of the baby is almost  coming\r\n\r\nout,\" that the nurse took steps to put her in  the\r\n\r\nlabour room. So this is really a bad situation and\r\n\r\nit is beyond my description. There have been cases\r\n\r\nlike this.

In my\r\n\r\nconstituency there are a few persons who carry  on\r\n\r\nthe  manufacture of gingili oil. This is done more\r\n\r\nor  less  as  a traditional business  on  a  small\r\n\r\nscale.  We  can  even say that these  are  cottage\r\n\r\nindustries.   Recently  the   manufacturers   have\r\n\r\nreceived  letters  from  the  Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\ninforming  them  that  they should  have  licences\r\n\r\nunder   the   Food   and  Drugs   Regulations   to\r\n\r\nmanufacture gingili oil. They are quite willing to\r\n\r\napply   for   licences.

One of the\r\n\r\nmajor  difficulties which they now face is finding\r\n\r\naccommodation  for their families elsewhere.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Rule which insists that the place of dwelling\r\n\r\nshould be different from that of business could be\r\n\r\napplied  to  applicants who start  their  business\r\n\r\nafter  the  coming into operation  of  this  Rule,\r\n\r\nwhich I believe is from 1-1-65. But in the cases I\r\n\r\nhave  cited, could the Minister be good enough  to\r\n\r\nconsider  them sympathetically, as they have  been\r\n\r\nthere for more than 20 years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I tend to\r\n\r\nagree with the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Aljunied that, in the determination of whether\r\n\r\na  factory should be licensed or not, perhaps some\r\n\r\nexemption  may he permitted if such a  factory  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a small one and could be classified  as  a\r\n\r\nhome  industry. But the rub is that one  does  not\r\n\r\nknow  exactly when it is a home industry that  has\r\n\r\ndone  so  well that it has become a real  factory.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is not, I think, a fair principle  to\r\n\r\nsay that just because a factory has been going  on\r\n\r\nfor the last 20 years, therefore, it should go  on\r\n\r\nfor  the  next 20 years in its old-fashioned  way.\r\n\r\nBecause  Singapore  is  fast  being  rebuilt   and\r\n\r\nurbanised, what used to be a cottage industry  and\r\n\r\nmay  be far, far away from the city area 10 or  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago is not the same cottage industry today,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  might very well be in  the  heart  of\r\n\r\nSingapore itself, so that it is necessary to  have\r\n\r\nsome  element of control and the minimum of health\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, say that precautions have been\r\n\r\ntaken  in the Ministry of Health for the Licensing\r\n\r\nCommittee  to be composed not only of professional\r\n\r\nofficers  but,  in  fact,  to  have  a  membership\r\n\r\nlargely composed of Members of Parliament who  are\r\n\r\nnon-professionals   and   who   are   best   able,\r\n\r\ntherefore,    to    appreciate    the    political\r\n\r\nimplications  in  the implementation  of  official\r\n\r\nregulations,  etc. It is my view  that  for  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time, the Licensing Committee of my Ministry\r\n\r\nseems   to  have  been  somewhat  rigid   in   its\r\n\r\napplication of regulations, and I had hoped  that,\r\n\r\nwith  the  presence  of  a large  number  of  non-professionals  in this Committee, this  aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem  would be looked into.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am, in fact, contemplating a change in  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  the membership of  the  Licensing\r\n\r\nCommittee to include members of the public who are\r\n\r\ngenerally  affected by such licensing  policy,  so\r\n\r\nthat   there  would  be  various  viewpoints   and\r\n\r\nopinions  expressed  in this Committee  comprising\r\n\r\nprofessional  officers,  those  in  the  political\r\n\r\nfield, and also ordinary members of the public, to\r\n\r\nensure  that the policy that we implement will  be\r\n\r\nfound   to  be  reasonable  and,  therefore,   any\r\n\r\nharshness in the application of regulations  might\r\n\r\nbe tempered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nMinister.

But the Health\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  asked them to have a better  place.\r\n\r\nThis  is  more  or less a case where these  people\r\n\r\nhave been running this business for the last 20 or\r\n\r\n30  years.

In this respect, I must, first of  all,\r\n\r\nexpress  my  gratitude to him for his co-operation\r\n\r\nand   the  part  he  himself  has  played  in  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful resiting of hawkers in his constituency\r\n\r\nof  River  Valley, especially the large number  of\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers who used to  congregate  along\r\n\r\nKilliney Road and Killiney Road Private Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of this year we outlined the\r\n\r\nbasic  principles of the new Hawkers Code for  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  and control of an estimated  40,000  to\r\n\r\n50,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers in Singapore. We have  accepted\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  hawking  is  a  way  of  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  we  have  also  ensured  that  any\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  is entitled  to  apply  for  a\r\n\r\nhawker's licence so long as he complies with a few\r\n\r\nbasic principles - of not being a public menace in\r\n\r\nrespect of public health, be a problem to traffic,\r\n\r\nwhether pedestrian or motor, and flouting law  and\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have for a start licensed more than 2,500\r\n\r\nhawkers  in  pasar malams at 66 sites.  With  that\r\n\r\nexperience  we  then moved on  to  selected  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  there  were hawkers congregated  at  street\r\n\r\njunctions, and the Killiney Road Market was one of\r\n\r\nthe  selected  targets  where  we  wanted  to  put\r\n\r\nmatters right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Members of Parliament, which\r\n\r\nalso   includes  my  friend  and  colleague,   the\r\n\r\nMinister    for   Finance,   in   the    Cairnhill\r\n\r\nConstituency, we tackled hawkers around Koek  Road\r\n\r\nand Newton Circus. We have up to date licensed and\r\n\r\ncontrolled about 5,000 hawkers during 1966. As  we\r\n\r\nhave had something like 12,000 licences issued  to\r\n\r\nhawkers  prior  to  the introduction  of  the  new\r\n\r\nHawkers Code, we can say that today we have  under\r\n\r\nlicence and control something like 17,000 hawkers.\r\n\r\nWe  still have to license, I think, another 30,000\r\n\r\nto  40,000. In other words, another two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem has yet to be tackled. We have  about\r\n\r\none-third  of  the  problem in hand.  Given  time,\r\n\r\npatience   and   co-operation  from   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  as  well  as  from  members   of   the\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees  and  from  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  themselves, we should be able to  resolve\r\n\r\nthis problem in a couple of years. The most recent\r\n\r\nattempt  at licensing and controlling hawkers  was\r\n\r\nin  the  North  Bridge Road and High Street  area.\r\n\r\nEven  just outside this House, there used to be  a\r\n\r\nnumber of hawkers plying their wares on the  five-foot way. I think there is now easy access to  all\r\n\r\nand  sundry when they shop along North Bridge Road\r\n\r\nand   High  Street,  which,  I  think,   is   very\r\n\r\nnoticeable.  We have been able to do this  because\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   the   co-operation  of  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for  Culture  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament for Stamford. With his  kind\r\n\r\nco-operation,  we have been able to  persuade  the\r\n\r\nhawkers to take alternative sites in side streets,\r\n\r\naway  from traffic junctions and busy streets,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can continue with their  business  and\r\n\r\nalso allow the life of this community to go on  as\r\n\r\nit  should.  I can say with quiet confidence  that\r\n\r\nthe  progress in the resiting of hawkers has  been\r\n\r\nreasonably  smooth,  that we  have  achieved  some\r\n\r\nsuccess,  and that we hope, given a bit  of  time,\r\n\r\nthat  the  problem of hawkers in  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nsoluble one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But here I will just\r\n\r\ngive my plain facts. The task of the Public Health\r\n\r\nDivision  is an onerous one. Whether our city  can\r\n\r\nbecome  the  healthiest and cleanest in South-East\r\n\r\nAsia depends on the work of this division. Why  do\r\n\r\nI  say so? Let me give some examples. We know that\r\n\r\nduring   these  two  years  Singapore  has   never\r\n\r\nexperienced any cases of malaria or any  epidemic.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a very commendable situation.  In  other\r\n\r\ncountries epidemics are very prevalent.  It  shows\r\n\r\nthat   we  are  very  progressive  in  our  health\r\n\r\nservices.   The   rate  of   mortality   is   also\r\n\r\ndecreasing.  This shows that our medical  services\r\n\r\nare  quite efficient. Our Health Ministry is  also\r\n\r\npropagating  family  planning.  This  is  a   very\r\n\r\ncommendable effort. I would like to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister and the people concerned on\r\n\r\ntheir achievements in these meritorious services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch upon the regulations\r\n\r\nimposed  upon  the hawkers. Hawkers  are  a  major\r\n\r\nproblem  in  our  society. The aim of  controlling\r\n\r\nhawkers  is  to put our hawker problem  in  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  Hawkers are also  our  citizens.  To\r\n\r\nhawk is their right in order to make a living.  We\r\n\r\nare  allotting sites to them. This is  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  our  economic policy. Hawkers in  the  Telok\r\n\r\nAyer Basin also have a hawkers' bazaar there. That\r\n\r\nis  also  a way whereby a few hundred hawkers  can\r\n\r\nmake a living. It is one of the good actions taken\r\n\r\nby Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect is about the X-ray campaign\r\n\r\nundertaken  by the Health Ministry. For  instance,\r\n\r\nin my Sembawang Constituency, the people have been\r\n\r\nafforded the opportunity for free X-rays. This  is\r\n\r\na  commendable action on the part of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nI hope this work will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention another matter. I\r\n\r\nremember   that   at  the  previous   sitting   of\r\n\r\nParliament,  a few Members raised the question  of\r\n\r\ncleanliness and cleansing on the island. I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he is considering  launching  a\r\n\r\ncleansing campaign on a national scale.  He  might\r\n\r\nbe able to call upon all Members of Parliament and\r\n\r\nother  people  concerned to  clean  up  the  whole\r\n\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Health Ministry can do\r\n\r\ntheir task better next year than this year in  all\r\n\r\nfields, whether in relation to hawkers, cleansing,\r\n\r\netc.,  in  order  to  maintain  our  standard  and\r\n\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

First,  a  couple  of  days  ago  we  had\r\n\r\noccasion to hear our No. 2 Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Health. I do not know how  to\r\n\r\nrefer to him, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One solution would be to refer to\r\n\r\neither the more recent one or the older one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The recent one, Sir. He replied\r\n\r\nto  various supplementary questions in  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe eradication of the rampant mosquito menace  in\r\n\r\nour  Republic. Sir, up till today I  am  not  very\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with his answers. He was more  or  less\r\n\r\ndodging  a direct answer all the time in spite  of\r\n\r\nbeing  faced with a direct question.  I  hope  our\r\n\r\nMinister  today can clarify this matter in  regard\r\n\r\nto  the  setting up of the Anti-mosquito  Unit  to\r\n\r\neradicate the mosquito menace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is in regard to our civil\r\n\r\nservice.  I  think this House will agree  with  me\r\n\r\nthat  our  civil service is, in fact, one  of  the\r\n\r\nbest in this part of the world. I am happy to note\r\n\r\nthat  we have one senior civil servant present  in\r\n\r\nthis House. The civil servants have rendered loyal\r\n\r\nand  dedicated  service,  but  in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ndischarging  their  services, some  of  them  have\r\n\r\nbroken down, just as motor-car engines do. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that a number of civil servants, having\r\n\r\ncontracted sickness like cancer and heart trouble,\r\n\r\nhave to go overseas for treatment, not because  we\r\n\r\ncannot  treat them here but because the facilities\r\n\r\nhere,  I  understand,  are  still  inadequate.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  we have the Institute of Medical  Research\r\n\r\nwell  in  hand. Still, life is more precious  than\r\n\r\nwealth.  Therefore, these civil servants  who  are\r\n\r\nseriously  sick will inevitably have to leave  our\r\n\r\nshore  to  seek treatment elsewhere.  Sir,  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering  whether the Minister will come  to  the\r\n\r\nrescue  by  considering whether or not to  provide\r\n\r\nsuch  civil servants passages to whichever country\r\n\r\nthey  wish to go for treatment and also allowances\r\n\r\nfor such treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is this. I wonder whether our\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  institute some  sort  of  health\r\n\r\ninsurance   scheme  for  our  civil  servants.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  there  was a case not  very  long  ago\r\n\r\nwhere  a  civil  servant died as a  result  of  an\r\n\r\noperation.  No doubt, Sir, there was no negligence\r\n\r\ninvolved. But, sad to say, although his family got\r\n\r\nsome money, they suffered a bigger loss in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonetary  returns  and  security.  So  our   civil\r\n\r\nservants,   in   the  course  of   their   duties,\r\n\r\nespecially those who meet with a fatal accident or\r\n\r\nwho contract a dangerous illness, will not be able\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  give their expected  quality  of\r\n\r\nservice. Therefore, Sir, I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider  my  suggestion to institute  a  sort  of\r\n\r\nhealth insurance scheme for civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

He has spoken  in\r\n\r\nvery  glowing terms about the Ministry of  Health,\r\n\r\nand  I am glad he has chosen it to be the Ministry\r\n\r\nwith which he wishes to be associated. Because  of\r\n\r\nits  good reputation, he is adding mere lustre  to\r\n\r\nit. I am pleased to say that he is doing very good\r\n\r\nwork in the Ministry of Health, especially in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassisting  the second Parliamentary  Secretary  in\r\n\r\nhawker  control, and he has given us very valuable\r\n\r\nadvice.  I  am  sure that with his continued  good\r\n\r\nwork  we  should be able to resolve this  big  and\r\n\r\noutstanding social problem in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his call for a general cleansing\r\n\r\ncampaign  in Singapore, I can assure him  that  he\r\n\r\nwill  be called upon very soon to lead it, because\r\n\r\nI  gather the Public Daily Rated Employees' Unions\r\n\r\nFederation are intent on following up their strike\r\n\r\nballot.  If  I  am correct, they are  supposed  to\r\n\r\nserve  their strike notice today, or maybe it  has\r\n\r\nalready   been  served.  So  a  general  cleansing\r\n\r\ncampaign will very soon be coming, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang will lead it.

I do not think it is fair\r\n\r\nto  say  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah - he is not in the House at\r\n\r\nthe  moment, because he is now in the St. Andrew's\r\n\r\nOrthopaedic Hospital making a short speech  on  my\r\n\r\nbehalf for the children's concert way up in Siglap\r\n\r\n-  was  trying  to give a very evasive  answer  to\r\n\r\nMembers  who were very critical about the mosquito\r\n\r\n\"population\",   which  has   also   increased   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  thought  he did  exceedingly  well.\r\n\r\nBecause the problem of mosquitoes in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot   just   a   question  of  exterminating   the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes as you see them. We have to get down to\r\n\r\nthe basic causes and there are numerous causes why\r\n\r\nwe  are  having  so many mosquitoes  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday. Not that we are very proud about it, but it\r\n\r\nis  a  legacy. First of all, there has been  rapid\r\n\r\nbuilding  development over the last five years  of\r\n\r\nwhich we are all so proud, but, unfortunately,  it\r\n\r\ndoes create problems. Because of the speed to  get\r\n\r\nthings  done,  other factors are sometimes  either\r\n\r\nignored  or  put on a very low priority,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhilst we see many beautiful multi-storeyed  flats\r\n\r\nand  factories  coming up, many drains  have  been\r\n\r\nblocked. So we see after every shower large  pools\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstagnant  water,  and  within  a  week,  we   have\r\n\r\nmillions  of mosquitoes. It is a case  of  chasing\r\n\r\nand  closing up all these possible loopholes. This\r\n\r\nhas  to  be tackled at ground level. Then we  have\r\n\r\nnumerous drains all of which have been covered  up\r\n\r\nto  look pretty on which to allow hawkers to hawk.\r\n\r\nBut  underneath, the drains are clogged and  there\r\n\r\nis no flow of water, and stagnant water results in\r\n\r\nthe  breeding of mosquitoes. Then we have our tens\r\n\r\nof  thousands  of hawkers who use  the  drains  as\r\n\r\nrefuse  dumps. They, and even our citizens,  throw\r\n\r\ntheir  rubbish into these drains. I would like  to\r\n\r\ninform  this  House  that  three-quarters  of  the\r\n\r\nrefuse  which we throw into our city garbage  dump\r\n\r\nis  collected from the streets or dug out from the\r\n\r\ndrains.  Public  streets and drains  are  used  as\r\n\r\nrefuse  dumps.  We  have  to  educate  the   whole\r\n\r\npopulation not to treat the streets and drains  as\r\n\r\nrefuse  dumps, and that takes time. Let us have  a\r\n\r\nlook  at our schools. Every school ground looks  a\r\n\r\ndisgrace with all the litter which has been thrown\r\n\r\nby  students.  This  practice is  not  checked  by\r\n\r\nteachers. And so it goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there must be a health campaign to make\r\n\r\neveryone  pick up the litter and put it  into  the\r\n\r\nwaste-paper  basket. We have to provide  thousands\r\n\r\nof  wastepaper baskets all over the  city.  Almost\r\n\r\nevery  home has a little garden, and in collecting\r\n\r\nrain  water it breeds mosquitoes at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe  people complain about mosquitoes, but at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time they are breeding mosquitoes  in  their\r\n\r\nbackyard. Despite the fact that D.D.T. is  such  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  anti-mosquito  insecticide,  mosquitoes\r\n\r\nhave become clever and now they are also resistant\r\n\r\nto D.D.T. The few that are not killed become tough\r\n\r\nand thereafter D.D.T. does not affect them. So  we\r\n\r\nhave    a    stronger   breed    of    mosquitoes,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, not only in Singapore but all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world. All these, I am afraid, Sir,  are  big\r\n\r\nproblems. However, we are at the moment conducting\r\n\r\na  three-month pilot scheme for a selected area in\r\n\r\nSingapore bounded by the Geylang River, Guillemard\r\n\r\nRoad, Paya Lebar, Sims Avenue, Lorong 3, Geylang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad  and Kallang River - an area with about 8,000\r\n\r\nhouses  - and a specific house-to-house survey  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes is being carried out. We should be able\r\n\r\nto  complete  this survey this month and  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  a position to launch an  island-wide\r\n\r\ncampaign. I can then assure the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\nthat even in his constituency we should be able to\r\n\r\nsee  a reduced number of mosquitoes, but not  just\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the civil\r\n\r\nservants  who,  because of illness,  may  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary - as stated by the Member for Punggol  -\r\n\r\nto  seek  medical treatment overseas. I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthis is a matter which is not under my control.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Ministry of Finance has to come into the\r\n\r\npicture.   As  soon  as  the  Salaries  Commission\r\n\r\npublishes  its  findings, and if  this  matter  of\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits does not come into the  picture,\r\n\r\nperhaps it could be taken up separately then. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  the instance the Member has mentioned,\r\n\r\nthat  someone  having died on the operation  table\r\n\r\nshould  have had health insurance, is really  what\r\n\r\nhe wants. The way to help this particular bereaved\r\n\r\nfamily   is   whether  there  is  adequate   life\r\n\r\ninsurance  or not. Health insurance  does  not  do\r\n\r\nanything except meet the medical expenses for  the\r\n\r\noperation,  whether the person is dead  or  alive.\r\n\r\nBut  if the poor chap dies on the operation table,\r\n\r\nand  if  he has had some life insurance,  then  he\r\n\r\ngets  the benefit of the life insurance,  but  not\r\n\r\nhealth  insurance. Health insurance  really  means\r\n\r\nthat if you pay your premiums, and in case medical\r\n\r\nexpenses have to be incurred, like the payment  of\r\n\r\noperation  expenses,  then the  insurance  company\r\n\r\npays for the expenses, which would probably amount\r\n\r\nto just a few hundred dollars. I would say that we\r\n\r\nwould  like  to look after our civil  servants  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  we  can.  Not only can they  break  down\r\n\r\nbecause  of  hard  work, but I  think  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  can  also break down because  of  hard\r\n\r\nwork.  But  I  think,  all  in  all,  we  have   a\r\n\r\nreasonably good health service and I hope  we  can\r\n\r\nmaintain the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh standard of health services in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for his detailed explanation.

I have said from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime  that  trade between Indonesia and  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  be  normalised. We cannot expect  the  same\r\n\r\nvolume  of trade that we had before confrontation,\r\n\r\nfor  the  simple reason that during confrontation,\r\n\r\nIndonesian   merchants  had  already   established\r\n\r\ndirect  contact with their sources of  supply  and\r\n\r\nmarkets. Mr Speaker, Sir, the resumption of trade\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia  could not by any stretch  of  the\r\n\r\nimagination  come to the pre-confrontation  level.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, what we have is largely in the form\r\n\r\nof  barter trade, and as regards that, I think  it\r\n\r\nhas  almost  reached pre-confrontation level.  But\r\n\r\nwhether  or not trade will further improve depends\r\n\r\nvery  much  again upon the situation in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nitself  and  upon  the policies  that  are  to  be\r\n\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether trade will really start flowing between\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and Singapore does not depend  so  much\r\n\r\nupon  how  many visas could be issued by Indonesia\r\n\r\nto  our  traders, but upon whether they could  get\r\n\r\nover  the foreign exchange difficulties in  buying\r\n\r\nhere and whether they would be able to resuscitate\r\n\r\nor  rehabilitate their transport, distribution and\r\n\r\ncollecting systems, so that more of their  produce\r\n\r\ncould be sent abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt at all that now that the\r\n\r\nfloodgates   have   been  opened   following   the\r\n\r\nrecognition of Singapore by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and the signing of trade  and  shipping\r\n\r\nagreements, there will be an increasing volume  of\r\n\r\ntrade   between   Singapore  and   Indonesia.

As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  extension  of  services  due   to\r\n\r\nMalayanisation and various other factors, we  have\r\n\r\nlost quite a large number of civil servants in the\r\n\r\nhigher  echelons,  and  therefore  quite  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  posts  have to  be  filled  by  acting\r\n\r\nappointments. But the civil service being what  it\r\n\r\nis  --  once  a  man  has been appointed,  he  has\r\n\r\nsecurity  of tenure -- we want to be pretty  sure,\r\n\r\nas  far  as possible, that the man who is promoted\r\n\r\nreally deserves promotion.

This  is  a\r\n\r\npassing phase and I expect that with more and more\r\n\r\nqualified  people coming out from our universities\r\n\r\nand from abroad, we will be able very soon to fill\r\n\r\nall these posts substantively by people who really\r\n\r\ndeserve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 2005 refers to Subsidy\r\n\r\nto  Housing and Development Board for an amount of\r\n\r\nover $8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister could\r\n\r\nprovide  the  House with some detailed information\r\n\r\non this subsidy granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a\r\n\r\nprevalent belief that the Housing Board is  making\r\n\r\nmoney because most people - and I think rightly so\r\n\r\n-  consider that a landlord makes money  from  the\r\n\r\nproperties  he  lets  out,  and  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  being  the  largest  property\r\n\r\nholder  or  the biggest landlord in Singapore,  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  make  money. But  contrary  to  this\r\n\r\nbelief,  the Board was set up not with the  object\r\n\r\nof  making  money from properties,  but  with  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  providing the lower  income  group  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens with modern housing at  rentals\r\n\r\nwell within their means. Its objective, therefore,\r\n\r\nis  to house as many of the poorer group of people\r\n\r\nas  possible  at a rental which most of  them  can\r\n\r\nafford to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the large number of houses which the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board  has  put  up  and\r\n\r\nrented  out,  it  is running at a  loss.  For  the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  Members and the  public,  I  have\r\n\r\nfigures  here showing the amount of subsidies  for\r\n\r\nthe  various types of houses put up by the Housing\r\n\r\nBoard.  As  you  know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  standardise  the  rentals  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible so that the same rental would be paid for\r\n\r\none-room   units  all  over  Singapore  with   the\r\n\r\nexception, of course, of the houses built in urban\r\n\r\nareas,  because of the high cost of land  and  the\r\n\r\nbetter  type  of construction that is required  in\r\n\r\nurban areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what we call an emergency one-room unit which\r\n\r\nis let out at $20 per month to Singapore citizens,\r\n\r\nthe \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproximate  subsidy  per unit per  mouth  varies  from\r\n\r\n$15.50  to $18.50, depending upon the cost of  the\r\n\r\nstructure. For what we call the standard  one-room\r\n\r\nunit  in a suburban area where a rental of $26  is\r\n\r\nbeing  charged, the subsidy per unit per month  is\r\n\r\n$15.  For  the  improved one-room units,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhich  have been built and some of which  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  the central area and where  the  rental\r\n\r\ncharge is $36.50 in the central area and $30 in  a\r\n\r\nsuburban area, the subsidy varies from $15 to  $18\r\n\r\nper  unit  per month, depending upon the price  of\r\n\r\nland  and  the cost of construction in each  area.\r\n\r\nFor the standard two-room unit in the central area\r\n\r\nwhere the rent is $66.50, and in the suburban area\r\n\r\nwhere the rent is $46.50, the subsidy per unit per\r\n\r\nmonth  is  round  about  $9.80  to  $10.  For  the\r\n\r\nimproved two-room unit where the rent charged in a\r\n\r\ncentral  area is $66.50, the subsidy  varies  from\r\n\r\n$10  to  $15 per unit per month. For the  standard\r\n\r\nthree-room unit in a central area where  the  rent\r\n\r\nis  $96.50,  and in a suburban area it is  $66.50,\r\n\r\nthe  subsidy  varies from $2 to $5  per  unit  per\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are now over\r\n\r\n80,000  units  let  out to the  public  under  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nand the total subsidy for these units next year is\r\n\r\nestimated  at $8 million. Therefore,  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard is one of the few landlords who do not  make\r\n\r\nmoney  but  lose money, all for a good cause,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is to provide better housing for the  poorer\r\n\r\nsection of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have clarified the question of subsidy\r\n\r\nhere,  unless  the  Member for  River  Valley  has\r\n\r\nfurther questions for clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Even   the\r\n\r\neditorials in the Sin Chew Jit Poh have  commented\r\n\r\non this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a previous sitting, I have already given my\r\n\r\nviews  on this. What I want to know is how we  can\r\n\r\nmake  our economic development keep pace with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the employment situation  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years. In other words, how are  we  to\r\n\r\nprovide  jobs  not only for the tens of  thousands\r\n\r\nunemployed,  but  also for the  50,000  to  60,000\r\n\r\npeople   who  will  be  seeking  employment?   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has told us that unemployment\r\n\r\nis  one of our serious social problems. I say,  in\r\n\r\nall  fairness, that he is adopting a very cautious\r\n\r\nattitude to this question. I will quote an excerpt\r\n\r\nfrom his speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Although we are full of confidence in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  future  of  our  economy,   this\r\n\r\nconfidence  should not be a cause for elation  and\r\n\r\ncomplacency.  This should not make  our  merchants\r\n\r\nand people think that things are all right or that\r\n\r\nthe world owes us a living. If we want to progress\r\n\r\nand  survive,  we  must redouble  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove our economy which is not the same as  that\r\n\r\nof  any  other country. So our economic future  is\r\n\r\nfull  of crises as well as bright prospects  which\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the  situation in  this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote this excerpt from the speech of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance to express my feelings  and\r\n\r\nshare  in  his sentiments. It shows that not  only\r\n\r\ndoes he have confidence in our economic future but\r\n\r\nhe  also  worries about it. This  is  a  sentiment\r\n\r\nwhich everybody can share with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance made two points on external trade but he did not explain them in detail to this House. The first is that for the first nine months the imports amounted to about $3,000 million and the exports amounted to about $2,400 million. As a result, there is an\r\n\r\nunfavourable balance of trade of $600 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we are losing $600 million worth\r\n\r\nof  foreign exchange, although, according to  what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has said in this  House,\r\n\r\nthere  are  about $1,100 million worth of  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves. But if we were to lose so much annually,\r\n\r\nthen the outcome would be disastrous. So I hope he\r\n\r\nwill  think  of  ways to remedy the situation  and\r\n\r\nreduce this unfavourable balance of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about the increase of external\r\n\r\ntrade. According to reports in the newspapers,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  increase  in  our  trade  can  be\r\n\r\nascribed  to  several factors. One is  that  South\r\n\r\nVietnam's  trade  with  us  has  increased  to   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Mr Teong, please proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Trade between\r\n\r\nSouth Vietnam and us has increased. This is mainly\r\n\r\ndue  to the fact that there is a war going  on  in\r\n\r\nVietnam. It is a rather abnormal situation. But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that once the war is ended, then trade  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect will also reduce. So I believed  the\r\n\r\nMinister will agree with me when I say that if  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  rely on our trade with South Vietnam  to\r\n\r\nkeep our economy going well, then that will not be\r\n\r\nquite reliable. Better prospects for our trade may\r\n\r\nperhaps  to  a  great extent depend on  the  trade\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Indonesia and East\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropean and some Afro-Asian countries. This is  a\r\n\r\nbetter way out for our trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nis  that in future, when our country has any trade\r\n\r\ntreaties  with other countries, we should  try  to\r\n\r\nattain  a balance of trade. For instance, we  have\r\n\r\nsigned  trade  agreements with  Russia,  Bulgaria,\r\n\r\nHungary and other countries. We should see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  we  are able to maintain a balance of  trade\r\n\r\nwith  these  countries so that we will  not  incur\r\n\r\nlosses in foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope the Minister can inform this\r\n\r\nHouse  how  much profit every year we are  getting\r\n\r\nout  of  our foreign reserves, amounting to $1,100\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In  his\r\n\r\nspeech  he  enumerated certain export  incentives,\r\n\r\nand  I  just  want to know, if he could  tell  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  whether those export incentives  apply  to\r\n\r\nexports to West Malaysia and Malaysia as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nfrom the Budget speech of the Finance Minister, we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that we are able to achieve  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget without tax increases. This, of course,  is\r\n\r\nvery   encouraging  to  everybody  in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,   we  are  still  concerned   about   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  population  in  Singapore  which,   if\r\n\r\nunchecked,   may  go  beyond  our  control.   This\r\n\r\npopulation  growth is getting bigger  and  bigger,\r\n\r\nand in order to consolidate our economic position,\r\n\r\nwe  have  all  agreed  to rely  a  great  deal  on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in addition to  entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nThat means to say that we have to concentrate  all\r\n\r\nour   energies  and  efforts  on  developing   our\r\n\r\nindustries in the various fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this connection, I would like to\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister to give me some clarification\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the factories already  set  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and their manufactures.  What  kind  of\r\n\r\nprotection   is  given  to  the  manufactures   of\r\n\r\nexisting factories in Singapore? What steps has he\r\n\r\ntaken  to  see that the products of these existing\r\n\r\nfactories can have a place in a foreign market? At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  how is he going to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  local encouragement for the consumption\r\n\r\nof our own manufactures? Sir, we are encouraging a\r\n\r\nlot   of  investors  to  come  here  and  set   up\r\n\r\nfactories. We are doing a lot in this respect. But\r\n\r\nafter these investors have come here to invest, it\r\n\r\nappears  that their manufactures have not  reached\r\n\r\nthe  standard required. They have not  achieved  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory quality in their manufactures. So, in\r\n\r\nmy  view, in order to instil further confidence in\r\n\r\nthe manufacturers and to prospective investors and\r\n\r\nto   arouse   further  interest   in   our   local\r\n\r\ninvestments,  I  feel  that the  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nshould think of these manufacturers by opening  up\r\n\r\na  better consumption market locally. He must take\r\n\r\nall possible steps to encourage our own people  to\r\n\r\nuse our own products, because if our own people do\r\n\r\nnot  use  our  own  products, how  can  we  expect\r\n\r\nforeigners  to  use  our products?  This  is  very\r\n\r\ninconsistent. That is the situation that I know so\r\n\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that some Government departments do\r\n\r\nnot  even  encourage their officers to  buy  local\r\n\r\ngoods.   For  example,  some  articles   used   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments may be available  locally.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, the towels, soap, and toilet  paper\r\n\r\nin  the  Parliament House lavatories. Some  towels\r\n\r\nare  from  China, soap from other  countries,  and\r\n\r\neven  the toilet paper comes from a foreign  land.\r\n\r\nThese  are  very  common items  of  local  produce\r\n\r\navailable  here.  If we do not encourage  our  own\r\n\r\npeople to buy our own goods, how can we expect our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers to sell abroad? Are we  asking  them\r\n\r\nto  put  up their shutters? So without encouraging\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  local goods, we cannot  encourage\r\n\r\nfurther investment in our local industries.  So  I\r\n\r\nhope the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister will take positive and effective steps to\r\n\r\nencourage  further consumption of local  products.\r\n\r\nHe can put up certain encouraging slogans and give\r\n\r\nmore  publicity  to encourage our  people  to  use\r\n\r\nlocal  products.  This will go a step  further  to\r\n\r\nassist our economic development and bring about  a\r\n\r\nbrighter future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just\r\n\r\nnow  I was privileged to hear a Member on my side,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition side, saying that at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  there is an unfavourable balance of  trade\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, which is very dangerous to  us.  We\r\n\r\nshould  take remedial action in this respect.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister should have more courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has said that we\r\n\r\nshould  have  more trade with Indonesia.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  true  and correct, but our Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nreply  just  now  did  not  seem  to  have  enough\r\n\r\ncourage to open up more trade with Indonesia. I am\r\n\r\nsaying this, Mr Speaker, because I was living  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  for quite some time and knew about  the\r\n\r\nconditions there. A local banker has just returned\r\n\r\nfrom  Djakarta and he has spoken to me on  certain\r\n\r\nmatters.  According  to him,  the  Government  and\r\n\r\npeople  of  Indonesia would very much welcome  our\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government to send a trade  mission  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia to have further talks. Except  for  some\r\n\r\ntechnicalities to be taken care of,  the  time  is\r\n\r\nripe for us to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to say is that our able Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance should have sufficient courage to send\r\n\r\nsomeone  over there to talk with them, because  in\r\n\r\nthe past there were strong economic and commercial\r\n\r\nties  between  the two countries, and  trade  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  constituted about 30 per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\ntotal trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I wish to have further\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the Minister  on  his  answer\r\n\r\nabout  the acting posts. I agree with him that  we\r\n\r\nshould have qualified people in the civil service.\r\n\r\nBut  I  was  not happy just now when he said  that\r\n\r\nwherever possible civil servants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  acting  posts should be  replaced  with\r\n\r\npersons who are qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an ex-civil Servant, I know how much it\r\n\r\nwill  hurt  a person, who has been acting  for  so\r\n\r\nmany  years,  suddenly to find himself substituted\r\n\r\nby somebody else in the post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang has swallowed hook, line\r\n\r\nand  sinker, the propaganda line put out by people\r\n\r\nwho  are  not favourably inclined towards  us.  He\r\n\r\nfeels  that  because Singapore has an unfavourable\r\n\r\nbalance of trade, we are in dire danger of  losing\r\n\r\nour  external reserves. I think I did say sometime\r\n\r\nhere  that we have had an unfavourable balance  of\r\n\r\ntrade ever since we can remember, and yet we  have\r\n\r\nstill been able to increase our external reserves.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  talk about the unfavourable  balance  of\r\n\r\ntrade  and the figures which he quoted, they  only\r\n\r\npertain  to  what we call the visible  balance  of\r\n\r\ntrade.  That  is,  items  on  which  we  can   get\r\n\r\nstatistics and to which we can point our  fingers.\r\n\r\nBut there are other items which are not taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration  in drawing up these statistics.  It\r\n\r\nis  my  belief that from the invisible balance  of\r\n\r\ntrade,  from  earnings from the port, earnings  on\r\n\r\nservices  rendered, ship building, ship repairing,\r\n\r\ntourists  and investments, the inflow  of  capital\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad,  we have been able to  maintain  our\r\n\r\nposition, so that, in spite of the figures showing\r\n\r\nthat we have an unfavourable balance of trade from\r\n\r\nyear   to   year,  we  still  find,  with  prudent\r\n\r\nbudgetting  that we able to increase our  external\r\n\r\nreserves.   I  quite  agree  with  the   speakers,\r\n\r\nincluding the Member for Sembawang, who  say  that\r\n\r\nwe should depend more on our neighbours for trade.\r\n\r\nOf  course, it is easier if we can trade more  and\r\n\r\nmore  with our neighbours. But, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe   are   casting   our   net   far   and   wide.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  at  the  present  moment,   though\r\n\r\nIndonesia represents a very large market,  because\r\n\r\nof  conditions there and because of the  state  of\r\n\r\nthe  currency, trade with Indonesia is not as much\r\n\r\nas it should be. Though we would like to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsell to Indonesia, what they are interested in  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  is how much credit we can  give.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tiong Bahru, who, from  what  I  have\r\n\r\nheard  just now, was an ex-teacher (in Indonesia),\r\n\r\nfeels  that  with  courage we can  get  trade.  If\r\n\r\ntrading  is that simple, Mr Speaker, I think  the\r\n\r\ncourageous  elements in our society should  become\r\n\r\nthe  best traders! I can assure him that, if  need\r\n\r\nbe,  I  will lead a mission to Jakarta if it  will\r\n\r\nserve  any  useful purpose. But this  is  not  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  time. They have had several  missions\r\n\r\nhere,  and there are some difficulties with regard\r\n\r\nto  regulations  which will have to  be  clarified\r\n\r\nbefore  we  can really sit down and get going.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we have already signed a trade agreement and\r\n\r\nyet  trade is not going on as briskly as we  like.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Tiong Bahru may or may not know it,\r\n\r\nbut  quite  a  large number of  our  traders  have\r\n\r\nalready  had visas to go to Jakarta, but owing  to\r\n\r\nthe   conditions  there,  they  have  had   second\r\n\r\nthoughts. They may be lacking in courage, but they\r\n\r\nare  full of prudence and they are quite sagacious\r\n\r\nbusinessmen. So if there is any money to  be  made\r\n\r\nby  going  there, I am sure they  would  pluck  up\r\n\r\ncourage  to  go  there. Of  course,  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nentering  into a bilateral trade agreement  is  to\r\n\r\nsee that trade between the two countries balances.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  main purpose of a  bilateral  trade\r\n\r\nagreement.  We  are not going  to  enter  into  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with a country and say,  \"We  will  buy\r\n\r\nmore  from you than we sell to you.\" No.  We  say,\r\n\r\n\"Whatever  you sell to us, you must buy from  us.\"\r\n\r\nThe  idea  of  a  bilateral trade agreement  is  a\r\n\r\nbalanced trade between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants to know how much\r\n\r\nwe  earn  from investments of our foreign reserves\r\n\r\nabroad.  Mr Speaker, Sir, in the revenue accounts\r\n\r\nthey are all lumped together. It is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  separate  interest earnings  from  investments\r\n\r\nabroad and locally. But I would say roughly it  is\r\n\r\nin  the  region  of between $10  million  and  $11\r\n\r\nmillion  annually  on  the one  thousand  and  odd\r\n\r\nmillion dollars worth of foreign reserves that  we\r\n\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure whether or not the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nhas  talked about the Family Planning Association,\r\n\r\nand  whether she has heard about the progress this\r\n\r\nAssociation  has made during the last  few  years.\r\n\r\nReports  from  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nHealth, indicate that the population explosion  is\r\n\r\nwell  contained  and the rate of increase  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation, which was growing at the rate of about\r\n\r\n4  per  cent plus after the war, has come down  to\r\n\r\n2.4  per cent or so. Therefore, we have been  able\r\n\r\nto  contain the terrific increase in the  rate  of\r\n\r\npopulation growth immediately after the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what we are doing to protect local\r\n\r\nindustries, I can only assume that the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  toilet paper and towels in Parliament are not\r\n\r\nlocally manufactured is due to the fact that these\r\n\r\nare  probably  stocks  that are  carried  forward,\r\n\r\nbecause  directives have been sent time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain  to  every  Department  in  Government  that\r\n\r\npreference  should be given to buy local  products\r\n\r\nwherever   possible,  even  though  there   is   a\r\n\r\ndifference of 15 per cent in prices or more. I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you will personally  look\r\n\r\ninto  this question yourself so that we would  not\r\n\r\nhave toilet soap from China and perfumed soap from\r\n\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta asked what we have done to\r\n\r\naid  industrialists  whom  we  have  persuaded  to\r\n\r\ninvest  their money here. I think I have mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  already given some incentives. In\r\n\r\nthis   year's  budget  we  have  given  them  more\r\n\r\nincentives. To see that they get at least  a  fair\r\n\r\nshare  of  the  local market, that at  least  they\r\n\r\nwould  have a chance to capture some of the  local\r\n\r\nmarket, we have imposed quotas so that products of\r\n\r\na similar nature from abroad are either restricted\r\n\r\nin  the quantity that can be imported here or they\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay duty on coming in here.

Quite true. We cannot depend on it  alone.\r\n\r\nBut he adds a rider and says that when the Vietnam\r\n\r\nwar  is  ended  - I do not know; I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nanyone knows when it will be ended - there will  be\r\n\r\nless trade. I think when the Vietnam war is ended,\r\n\r\nif and when it is ended, there will be more trade,\r\n\r\nbecause you need more goods for reconstruction and\r\n\r\ndevelopment than for destruction. But I agree with\r\n\r\nhim  entirely that as much as possible  we  should\r\n\r\ntry  to  depend  on our neighbours. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nour  neighbours do not want us to depend on  them.\r\n\r\nSo  let us be independent ourselves and find other\r\n\r\nmarkets further afield, and if the markets  nearby\r\n\r\ndo  come to some sort of arrangement or feel  that\r\n\r\nit  is time that they consider that we should  co-exist,  then  well  and good, we  will  have  more\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Aljunied thinks\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  an  insult to a civil  servant  who,\r\n\r\nhaving acted in a post, is later on considered  to\r\n\r\nbe  unfit to hold that post substantively.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him  that in more cases than not,  when  a\r\n\r\nperson  has been acting there, the chances of  his\r\n\r\ngetting a promotion are much better. Because of  a\r\n\r\nlack of suitable officers at the moment, we cannot\r\n\r\nhelp  but make use of a few officers for the  time\r\n\r\nbeing.  But,  as  I  have said, the  tendency  for\r\n\r\nofficers  to act too long in the post is  becoming\r\n\r\nless  and  less, because we are getting  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  qualified people from both our  universities\r\n\r\nand from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould like to say that I have not been tricked  by\r\n\r\nthe propaganda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  other persons. As a matter of fact, we  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that there is an unfavourable trade balance.\r\n\r\nBut  I  am  glad to learn, that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  clarified the  position  further  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  this unfavourable balance  has  been\r\n\r\noffset by income from, invisible sources, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  provision of services, shipping and  repairs,\r\n\r\netc.  That means that our prosperity is  a  stable\r\n\r\none.  In other words, it is well-rooted and not  a\r\n\r\nsuperficial prosperity. In any case, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  believe  our Finance Minister will  agree  with\r\n\r\nwhat  I have said, that is, there is a problem  to\r\n\r\nbe solved in relation to trade expansion overseas.\r\n\r\nWe  must  try to cut down our overseas investments\r\n\r\nand  our unfavourable trade balance. If we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  an  unfavourable trade balance, we  will  be\r\n\r\nable to earn more foreign exchange. This will go a\r\n\r\nstep  further in developing our industries.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this development and construction, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  employment opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\npeople   and  their  livelihood  will  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the war in Vietnam, I am not\r\n\r\ndisputing  that  we should have  any  trade  with\r\n\r\nVietnam. No. I remember that during the Korean war\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  lot of trade between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nKorea.  It reached an unprecedented peak.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  more reliable sources  of  trade  with\r\n\r\nother  countries in the world. Our development  in\r\n\r\ntrade will thus be stable and more dependable  and\r\n\r\nwe  will earn more foreign exchange in future.  In\r\n\r\nany case, I am happy with the explanation given by\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister. It proves that he has every\r\n\r\nconfidence  in our ability to develop further  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  industries and foreign trade.

I hope the Minister can  explain  why\r\n\r\nthe  property  tax on this man's  house  has  been\r\n\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the overdue payment\r\n\r\nof  property  tax.  I have also  received  several\r\n\r\ncomplaints from people in my constituency who were\r\n\r\nfined  from  50  cents to several dollars  because\r\n\r\npayment of property tax was delayed for about  two\r\n\r\nor  three months. According to what they told  me,\r\n\r\nit seems that they were not to blame. They did not\r\n\r\npay  property  tax  as they did  not  receive  any\r\n\r\nnotice  and  no reminders were sent to them.  This\r\n\r\nwas  probably due to the postmen who,  being  new,\r\n\r\nwere   not   able   to  locate  their   addresses.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there was no delivery  of  notices  to\r\n\r\ntheir addresses, as a result of which they did not\r\n\r\nknow  about them and payment of property  tax  was\r\n\r\ndelayed.  The officers in the department concerned\r\n\r\ndid  not  accept the explanations given  by  these\r\n\r\npeople. Of course, according to regulations,  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  rightly  fined for  delaying  payment  of\r\n\r\nproperty    tax,   but,   according    to    their\r\n\r\nexplanations, it would appear that we were rather\r\n\r\nunfair to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas  announced that property tax on houses in  the\r\n\r\nurban area will be reduced from 36 per cent to  12\r\n\r\nper  cent. I would like to ask him whether he  has\r\n\r\nany  intention of reducing property tax on  houses\r\n\r\nin the rural areas as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We have the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  moving a reduction of $100 to  the  sum\r\n\r\nallocated  for Head 0807 which touches  on  income\r\n\r\ntax, estate duty, general collection section, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether or not\r\n\r\nyou  will  give a ruling, but I think it  is  only\r\n\r\nfair  and customary courtesy for a Member to  move\r\n\r\nhis amendment, wherever possible, under a specific\r\n\r\nHead if it is shown in the Estimates. That is just\r\n\r\nby the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Member for Sembawang has\r\n\r\ncompletely  not  realised  or  misunderstood   the\r\n\r\npurpose of the incentive for urban renewal  -  the\r\n\r\nincentive we give by reducing property tax from 36\r\n\r\nper  cent to 12 per cent for those developers  who\r\n\r\nare  willing to participate with us in  the  urban\r\n\r\nredevelopment  of the country. I  cannot  see  any\r\n\r\nconnection  between this incentive  to  people  to\r\n\r\ninvest and develop properties in the centre of the\r\n\r\ncity and the question of the rate of property  tax\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas. The $6 concession is a  very\r\n\r\nspecial concession given to those people who  have\r\n\r\nattap houses. The Member is asking for a reduction\r\n\r\nof  27  per cent in property tax on houses in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas,  and  here, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  one\r\n\r\nbegins  to realise more and more that the division\r\n\r\nbetween the rural and urban areas in Singapore  is\r\n\r\na  fictitious one, because the whole of  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  very  fast becoming an urban area. The  reason\r\n\r\nwhy the rate of property tax in the rural area  is\r\n\r\nlower than that in the urban area is that formerly\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas people did not  get  all  the\r\n\r\nservices  available to those living in  the  urban\r\n\r\narea - services which have to be paid for somehow\r\n\r\nor  other, and payment for part of the services is\r\n\r\nderived  from  the  collection  of  property  tax.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is a difference between the  rate\r\n\r\nof  property tax in the urban area and that in the\r\n\r\nrural area. It is a distinction which is very hard\r\n\r\nto  see  because,  as  I have said,  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ngradually  becoming an urban area  right  through.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  from a logical point of view,  instead\r\n\r\nof  reducing the rate of property tax in the rural\r\n\r\nareas now that most of the rural areas are getting\r\n\r\nthe advantage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  services that are available in the  urban\r\n\r\narea,  the rate of property tax in the rural areas\r\n\r\nshould come up to that in the urban area. However,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, we have many different rates  of\r\n\r\nproperty tax in Singapore, and these are relics of\r\n\r\nthe old days when circumstances were different.  I\r\n\r\nthink  very  soon  we will have to  sit  down  and\r\n\r\nreally think of a way to standardise property tax.\r\n\r\nBut  with  present commitments,  as  it  were,  we\r\n\r\nshould count ourselves most fortunate that,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the new form of assessing road tax  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease in car licence tax, we have no additional\r\n\r\ntaxation. I think all of us should heave a sigh of\r\n\r\nrelief,  instead of considering ways  of  reducing\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has brought up the case of one of his\r\n\r\nconstituents  whose assessment was almost  doubled\r\n\r\nand  he wondered on what basis the assessment  was\r\n\r\nraised. By and large, I think there is a review of\r\n\r\nassessment  where  the  assessor  feels  that  his\r\n\r\nproperty  has been under-valued and his  criterion\r\n\r\nwould be how much rent is being paid by properties\r\n\r\nof a similar type around that area. I think in the\r\n\r\ncase  mentioned by the hon. Member, if the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned is not satisfied - or anybody  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  -  with the assessment raised,  there  are\r\n\r\nprocedures available to him for making an  appeal.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  has also said that it is unfair  that\r\n\r\nsome   persons  who  never  received  notices   of\r\n\r\nassessment or whose addresses could not  be  found\r\n\r\nwere  fined between 50 cents and $5 for  delay  in\r\n\r\npayment.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  any  property  owner\r\n\r\nshould know that property tax is due on the 1st of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  and I believe there is a period,  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  15th  of March, within which he has  to  pay.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  you are a property  owner,  it  is\r\n\r\nincumbent upon you to pay your property tax within\r\n\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,993,570 for Head 0807 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0809 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0809 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on the Imports\r\n\r\nand  Exports Office.

The delays are in respect\r\n\r\nof   those   declarations  where   an   inadequate\r\n\r\ndescription of the goods is given, or  in  respect\r\n\r\nof  those  goods  where there  is  a  quantitative\r\n\r\nrestriction or quotas. In certain cases also these\r\n\r\ndeclarations  have  to be sent to  the  Statistics\r\n\r\nCoding  Section  for them to be placed  under  the\r\n\r\nright  code for statistical purposes. In instances\r\n\r\nof  this  nature, there would inevitably  be  some\r\n\r\ndelay,  but where sufficient information is  given\r\n\r\nand where no reference need be made to departments\r\n\r\nlike  Veterinary, Culture, Health,  or  Police  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the goods imported do conform to  the\r\n\r\nregulations for health or security purposes,  then\r\n\r\nnormally  they  would  all be  cleared  within  24\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member requests that goods consigned by air\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  priority  for  clearance.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, whether they come by  air,  sea  or\r\n\r\nland,  the  goods have to conform  to  our  import\r\n\r\nrestrictions.  And  here  again  where  sufficient\r\n\r\ndetails  and descriptions of the goods are  given,\r\n\r\nthey  would be cleared very quickly. So the  delay\r\n\r\ncomplained  of is not due to a shortage  of  staff\r\n\r\nbut  to  certain  procedures  which  have  to   be\r\n\r\nfollowed.

This is inevitable as\r\n\r\nevery application has to be thoroughly\r\n\r\ninvestigated not only to determine the length of\r\n\r\nresidence of the applicant but also whether he\r\n\r\nfulfils the other conditions for citizenship, such\r\n\r\nas good character, etc. In addition, some\r\n\r\napplicants must pass an elementary national\r\n\r\nlanguage examination. While we were in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe Citizenship Registry dealt with an average of\r\n\r\n40 cases a day. After independence, however, there\r\n\r\nwas a rush of applications for citizenship. This\r\n\r\nwas because citizenship is essential for Housing\r\n\r\nBoard accommodation, free education and other\r\n\r\nsocial amenities. The number of applications\r\n\r\nincreased to as many as 600 a day, whereas the\r\n\r\nstaff could only cope with interviewing 60 to 70\r\n\r\napplicants a day. This resulted in the Registry\r\n\r\nhaving to stagger the dates of interview of\r\n\r\napplicants. At one stage, the interval between the\r\n\r\nissue of an application form and the date of the\r\n\r\ninterview was as long as one year. However, in the\r\n\r\nmiddle of this year, the Registry staff was\r\n\r\nincreased, resulting in the Registry being able to\r\n\r\ncope with 140 interviews a day. At present, the\r\n\r\nsituation has improved with the Registry dealing\r\n\r\nwith about 150 applications a day, and the waiting\r\n\r\nperiod for the interview has been reduced to seven\r\n\r\nor eight months. With the completion of the\r\n\r\nnational re-registration exercise, it is expected\r\n\r\nthat the Citizenship Registry will be able to deal\r\n\r\nwith applications, more expeditiously.

When a non-citizen who has\r\n\r\nalready  obtained a blue identity  card  gets  his\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship,  he  has  to  get  a   red\r\n\r\nidentity  card.  In  answer  to  my  question   in\r\n\r\nParliament, the Minister for Labour said that  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a change the fee is only 50 cents. But  even\r\n\r\nafter  the  announcement  by  the  Minister,   the\r\n\r\nregistration officer insisted on a payment  of  $5\r\n\r\nbecause  he  thought it was a replacement.  I  can\r\n\r\nshow  a letter written by the registration officer\r\n\r\nto prove this. He did not think this was a change.\r\n\r\nHe  considered this a replacement. No one will say\r\n\r\nthat the change to a red identity card from a blue\r\n\r\nidentity  card  can be considered  a  replacement.\r\n\r\nLately,   I  spoke  to  the  Permanent  Secretary,\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour, on this matter and he promised\r\n\r\nto look into it. And now I am informed that he has\r\n\r\nreferred  it to the Attorney-General and a  ruling\r\n\r\nhas  been  made that the fee for such a change  is\r\n\r\nonly  50  cents. I am really very  happy  to  know\r\n\r\nabout  this decision. But there is one more point,\r\n\r\nand this is the refund of money colleted in excess\r\n\r\nfrom the public for such changes. I am told that a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons,  including  the  son  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance,  paid  $5 for changing the blue  identity\r\n\r\ncard for a red one. Can the Minister consider  the\r\n\r\nrefund  of excess fees collected and make a public\r\n\r\nannouncement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The national re-registration,\r\n\r\nalthough scheduled to be completed by the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  is likely to be carried forward  till\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  January 1967. Up to  10th  December,\r\n\r\n1,184,836 persons have been registered for the\r\n\r\nnew  laminated  cards. Of this  number,  1,055,242\r\n\r\npersons  are citizens.

When the notice to strike\r\n\r\nwas  about  to expire, the strike was not  carried\r\n\r\nout.  As  we  have  learnt, not  only  from  union\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the S.T.C., but also from leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe union who made a statement, the reason for not\r\n\r\ncarrying out the strike was that the laws  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic forbid trade unions from carrying  out  a\r\n\r\nstrike.  On this matter, I am of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nit  is  very  essential to clarify the  democratic\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Labour Ministry, i.e.,  what  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Labour Ministry is towards  labour\r\n\r\nunions in Singapore which wish to carry out strike\r\n\r\naction  after  they  have duly complied  with  the\r\n\r\nregulations  of the Labour Ordinance by  taking  a\r\n\r\nballot   to  strike.  If  it  is  true  that   the\r\n\r\nprohibition  against the unions  going  on  strike\r\n\r\nemanates  from  the Government  of  this  Republic\r\n\r\nthrough the Minister for Labour, then I am of  the\r\n\r\nopinion   that  our  labour  policy  is  not   yet\r\n\r\nimplemented fully. If the statements made  by  the\r\n\r\nleaders  and members of the S.T.C. Union  are  not\r\n\r\ntrue, then it must be clarified to the public that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  of  the  Republic,  through  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour, does not prevent unions  from\r\n\r\ngoing  on strike if they have a mandate for it.  I\r\n\r\nsay so, Mr Speaker, because we do not wish to see\r\n\r\nunion  leaders  making mistakes and then  shifting\r\n\r\nthe blame on to the Government and the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour. This must be clarified and the matter\r\n\r\nrectified so that the attitude and policy of the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry can be implemented properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  there  is no law in  Singapore  which\r\n\r\nforbids any union which wants to go on strike,  to\r\n\r\nstrike. However, the law does provide that in  the\r\n\r\ncase of an essential service, 14 days' notice will\r\n\r\nbe  required. Or when a case is referred  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration   Court,  then  no  strike   will   be\r\n\r\npermitted.  If  what the Member for Kampong  Kapor\r\n\r\nhas said is true, then I think the union officials\r\n\r\nwho  made the allegation to their members that the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  the  State forbid any strike,  are  just\r\n\r\ntrying  to  shift  their  responsibility  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   As  far  as  labour   disputes   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, the attitude of the Labour Ministry has\r\n\r\nalways  been to try to bring both parties together\r\n\r\nto  come to an amicable settlement without  having\r\n\r\nto  resort  to strikes; and also to see  that  the\r\n\r\nemployers  comply with all the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ordinance. I do not think it is the policy\r\n\r\nof  the Labour Ministry to forbid any strike if it\r\n\r\nis justified, and if the necessary procedures are\r\n\r\ncomplied with by the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Singapore has  the\r\n\r\nprivilege and opportunity to participate in  these\r\n\r\ntwo meets, and although the results of these games\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not up to our expectations, we have at  least\r\n\r\nsucceeded in strengthening the fraternal ties with\r\n\r\nother  participating  countries  and  establishing\r\n\r\ncontacts with a lot of new friends. For  us,  our\r\n\r\nparticipation  in these two meets is  not  to  win\r\n\r\nmedals, for we have a long way to go to attain the\r\n\r\nrequisite    standards    of    performance     at\r\n\r\ninternational  level. Our participation  in  these\r\n\r\nsports meets appeared to be merely that while  the\r\n\r\nplayers sweated it out in the arena, the officials\r\n\r\ntook  it  as a vacation or sight-seeing trip!  One\r\n\r\nexample is that, apart from the experience gained,\r\n\r\nour participation in the Twenty-sixth Table Tennis\r\n\r\nTournament  held in Peking 1961  was  not  at  all\r\n\r\nexploited,  and  there appears to be  no  adequate\r\n\r\npost-mortem,  apart  from  the  meaningless  Press\r\n\r\nstatements  issued  by the Team  official  on  his\r\n\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the source of the problem lies with the\r\n\r\nleadership of the various sport organisations.  We\r\n\r\nare  aware,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  there  is  a\r\n\r\npersonality  in Singapore who, by his  high-handed\r\n\r\nmanner  in  dealing with other sports associations\r\n\r\nby  virtue of his position, is regarded by sports-loving  people  with  distaste  and  as  a  sports\r\n\r\n\"racketeer\".  I have sufficient evidence  to  show\r\n\r\nthe  deplorable  state of affairs in  some  sports\r\n\r\norganisations, particularly in three  or  four  of\r\n\r\nthem  which are under the leadership of  the  same\r\n\r\nperson.  Sir, without prejudice and reflection  on\r\n\r\nother  sports  enthusiasts  who  are  always   the\r\n\r\nobjects of my admiration, one cannot see the logic\r\n\r\nof  a  man manoeuvring as the President of a group\r\n\r\nof  sports organisations whose activities  are  so\r\n\r\ndiverse - for example, the Singapore Table  Tennis\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Singapore  Amateur   Wrestling\r\n\r\nAssociation,  and  the Singapore  Amateur  Cycling\r\n\r\nAssociation are under the leadership of  one  man.\r\n\r\nThe only common bond among these associations,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I can see, is sports and perhaps monetary\r\n\r\nbenefits.   These  associations  are  capable   of\r\n\r\nexploiting all sports-loving people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know it is difficult for the Minister to\r\n\r\nreply  to what I have just said in the absence  of\r\n\r\ndetails and facts, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am quoting this as an example to justify my fear\r\n\r\nand  the  anxiety of the majority of  our  sports-loving  public who would undoubtedly like  to  see\r\n\r\nwhatever  donation  to any sports  association  is\r\n\r\nproperly expanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, to support my statement, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out  to the Minister that the three  sports\r\n\r\norganisations under the leadership of one  person,\r\n\r\nI  understand, have to pay no less than $100  each\r\n\r\nas  monthly rental for their premises which happen\r\n\r\nto be the homes of the official or his relatives.\r\n\r\nIn  short, these three associations pay  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  $100 a month each for one and the same  room\r\n\r\nunder   the  same  roof,  and  all  the  financial\r\n\r\nresources of these three associations are used for\r\n\r\nhis own benefit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to have to\r\n\r\ndeal with this matter at length, but for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of sports in our Republic -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
