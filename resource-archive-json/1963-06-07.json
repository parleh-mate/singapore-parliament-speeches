The Government seems to forget that it  no\r\n\r\nlonger  controls 43 seats in this House. As  such,  it\r\n\r\ncannot,  with  impunity, continue  its  arrogant  and\r\n\r\ndictatorial  attitude towards the  Opposition.  Today,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition is stirred to unite together to  teach\r\n\r\nthis  arrogant, this dictatorial Government a salutary\r\n\r\nlesson  that  the  interests of the people  cannot  be\r\n\r\nbrushed   aside  to  suit  the  convenience   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget time is Opposition time, and the Opposition\r\n\r\nwill  unitedly  strive  to  zealously  see  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not allowed to encroach on this valuable\r\n\r\nOpposition time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to give the reasons why this\r\n\r\nmotion  has to be opposed to the bitter end.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  not  arrogant,  if it were not  dictatorial,  it\r\n\r\nwould have followed common parliamentary practice. The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  through  its  Leader  of  the  House,  or\r\n\r\nthrough  its  stand-in as the Leader of the  House - the\r\n\r\nLeader  being on a jaunt overseas - should have  invited\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition for a discussion on the matter  in  an\r\n\r\nhonest attempt to persuade the Opposition to accept  a\r\n\r\ncurtailment of their rights under the Standing Orders.\r\n\r\nIf  such  an  honest attempt had been made,  we  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible   Opposition  would  have  signified   our\r\n\r\nacceptance if the reasons advanced were legitimate and\r\n\r\nirrefutable.  But  no, this arrogant  and  dictatorial\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  above common clay. The Opposition  has\r\n\r\nbeen bullied since the P.A.P. took office in 1959. The\r\n\r\nOpposition   can   and   still  should   be   bullied.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  the  Opposition has  gained  strength  in\r\n\r\nnumbers  to  the  extent of 25  against  25  (and  the\r\n\r\ndecisive factor is to come from Sembawang where no by-election  has yet been held since the death  of  Inche\r\n\r\nAhmad   bin  Ibrahim  nearly  a  year  ago)  but   the\r\n\r\nOpposition is not united because of the difference  in\r\n\r\nideology. With this contention in mind, this arrogant,\r\n\r\nthis  dictatorial Government blunders on.  I  say  its\r\n\r\narrogant,  its  dictatorial  attitude  on  this  issue\r\n\r\nbefore the House is a blunder, as it will find to  its\r\n\r\ncost.  The  Opposition will rise united on this  issue\r\n\r\nand   will   crush  this  arrogant,  this  dictatorial\r\n\r\nattitude of the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come, Sir, to the correspondence exchanged\r\n\r\nbetween  the Speaker and the Minister for  Finance.  I\r\n\r\nquote the reprehensible paragraph of the letter of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance dated 27th May, 1963:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In these circumstances, I am to state that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  reserves its position on this  matter  and\r\n\r\nafter  consultation with the Prime  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nState   Advocate-General,  I  may  address  a  further\r\n\r\ncommunication to you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  arrogance!  As  I  have said  on  many  previous\r\n\r\noccasions,  Sir, despite the fact that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  a  Ministry  of  Culture,  P.  A.  P.

We do not care whether\r\n\r\nthey  have  culture or not, but where  their  lack  of\r\n\r\nculture  leads  to  the  commission  of  a  breach  of\r\n\r\nprivilege,  this  House must take note  and  must  not\r\n\r\nallow  such  a  blatant breach to pass unchecked.  The\r\n\r\ntone  of  this letter of the Minister for  Finance  is\r\n\r\noffensive  and, to us, a clear breach of privilege.  I\r\n\r\nrefer   to   the   Legislative  Assembly  (Privileges,\r\n\r\nImmunities and Powers) Ordinance, 1962, Part V of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  deals with Offences and Penalties.

We  took\r\n\r\nthis  unprecedented step because of the appeal of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. We accepted his explanation  in\r\n\r\ngood  faith given to this House on 4th December, 1961,\r\n\r\nand  we now find that he has broken faith with us  and\r\n\r\nwe cannot allow him to continue to hoodwink us. On 4th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1961, he said inter alia, and I quote  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 15, No. 14, col. 1176:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is important that we in Singapore must not allow\r\n\r\nlack  of preparation to hold up the implementation  of\r\n\r\nmerger  plans  because  of possible  hold-ups  in  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  machinery. We must not  only  look  at\r\n\r\nwhat is likely to happen in 1962, we must also try  to\r\n\r\nvisualise events in 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Further down:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government anticipates that the preparation of\r\n\r\na  budget  for 1963 will encounter numerous  technical\r\n\r\nproblems of details.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Still further down:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The preparation of the budget for the new State of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as a constituent member of the Federation,\r\n\r\nwill he even more complicated and onerous.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And at col. 1177:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To settle the details of allocation of votes and\r\n\r\nrevenue   between   State  and   Central   Government,\r\n\r\nadditional  work  will devolve on `Treasury  officials\r\n\r\nand   those   Ministries  affected  by  transfers   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  and it is not likely  that  the  1963\r\n\r\nBudget will be ready in time. This may well expose the\r\n\r\nGovernment to criticism. There might even be a loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence in the administration. For this reason  and\r\n\r\nin  fairness to the administration, I will  be  asking\r\n\r\nthe  House to approve a vote on account for the  first\r\n\r\nsix months of 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And at col. 1178:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But let me add that the Treasury will, in spite of\r\n\r\nthe  heavy duties which the administration would  have\r\n\r\nto  undertake in the coming months, try to prepare the\r\n\r\nestimates  in time.

The sitting in March came  to\r\n\r\nan abrupt end at 6 a.m. on 10th April, and the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  was  stifled and two of their  motions  were\r\n\r\npushed  down  to this sitting  - a delay of two  months.\r\n\r\nLet  me  recount the crimes of the P.A.P.

A further  delay  of\r\n\r\ntwo   months  before  the  next  sitting,  i.e.,  this\r\n\r\nsitting.

Surely they could have fixed a sitting  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  May. They did not do this. Why?  Because\r\n\r\nthey  are  arrogant;  because  they  are  dictatorial;\r\n\r\nbecause  they are conceited and do not see  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  decayed to such an extent that the name  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. stinks worse than manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine the reasons why the Government\r\n\r\nfeels  that the motion by the Minister for Finance  is\r\n\r\nnecessary and in the public interest. The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  says that he has asked you, Sir,  to  arrange\r\n\r\nfor  an earlier sitting on 29th May as against the 7th\r\n\r\nof June as originally fixed by the Government. Because\r\n\r\nhis request has been turned down by the Speaker, he is\r\n\r\nnow  asking  the Opposition to surrender their  rights\r\n\r\nwhich  are protected by the Standing Orders,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government can go on their  arrogant  way\r\n\r\nwithout being pulled up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support the fully considered ruling of the\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Had  he  ruled  otherwise  and  allowed  the\r\n\r\narrogant  P.A.P.  Government to have  its  dictatorial\r\n\r\nway,   the  Opposition  might  have  been  forced   to\r\n\r\nchallenge the Speaker's ruling. Fortunately  for  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  for  Singapore, we have  a  Speaker  whose\r\n\r\nindependence  is unassailable. Sir, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance says in his letter to the Speaker on 24th  May\r\n\r\nthat - and this is really laughable:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... there have been a number of vital developments in\r\n\r\nconnection    with    Malaysia    which    necessitate\r\n\r\nfinalisation  of  the  Federation/Singapore  Financial\r\n\r\nTalks as soon is possible to enable the Malaysia Talks\r\n\r\nto be held in London at the end of June.

May he  get  well\r\n\r\nquickly and be up to his tricks again! May he be  here\r\n\r\non  Monday,  the 10th of June, to answer  my  Question\r\n\r\npostponed by me to that date under Standing Order  20,\r\n\r\nparagraph (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his letter to the Speaker dated 27th May,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance discloses that  his  request\r\n\r\nfor an earlier sitting is to enable the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand him to attend the Malaysia talks in London. Is the\r\n\r\npresence of the Minister for Finance really necessary,\r\n\r\nespecially  as  the Prime Minister has  already  taken\r\n\r\nupon  himself  to  deal  with  financial  matters   as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by the statements of the Prime Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe  Federation / Singapore financial talks,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance is just a silent partner  in  the\r\n\r\nwake  of  His Master's Voice, known the world over  at\r\n\r\none  time as H.M.V. with a picture of a gramophone and\r\n\r\na dog sitting silently and obediently listening to His\r\n\r\nMaster's  Voice?  Sir,  is  it  right  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to attend the talks in London as he  has  not\r\n\r\nyet  received a mandate from this House on the details\r\n\r\nof  merger? He calls it merger. But I call it  nothing\r\n\r\nbut  a  closer association in a sort of confederation.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Prime Minister did promise this House  that\r\n\r\nsuch  details will be fully debated in this House,  or\r\n\r\nis this another form of P.A.P. twist and double talk?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want it to be placed on record that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Minister for Finance - that  is,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P  Government   - have no right  to  participate  in\r\n\r\ntalks  in  London until they get a mandate  from  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  finalise details on merger, especially  now\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.  Government does not  have  a  clear\r\n\r\nmajority in this House and is even afraid to fight out\r\n\r\nthe decisive issue at Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Budget time is Opposition time, and that is why\r\n\r\nthe rights of the Opposition are protected by Standing\r\n\r\nOrders. Seven clear days' notice for the debate on the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement is laid down in the Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nto  enable the Opposition to make a detailed study  of\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement and a detailed examination of the\r\n\r\nEstimates  in  relation to the Budget  Statement.  The\r\n\r\nmotion  of the Minister for Finance not only  deprives\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition of this detailed study and examination\r\n\r\nof  an  important  issue affecting the  lives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  but it also requires the Opposition to  submit\r\n\r\namendments  for debate in the Committee of  Supply  by 12.30  p.m. tomorrow. A detailed examination  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  is usually carried out in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement of the Minister for Finance, and even\r\n\r\nif we the Opposition Members burn the midnight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noil   tonight,   we  cannot   adequately   and\r\n\r\neffectively look after the interests of the people  in\r\n\r\nso  far  as the 1963 Budget is concerned, and we  will\r\n\r\nresist to the bitter end this arrogant and dictatorial\r\n\r\nattempt by the Minister for Finance to choke us off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Standing Orders, we are to have five\r\n\r\ndays  allotted for the Committee of Supply. The motion\r\n\r\nlimits  this to three days, and while it is  true,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Minister for Finance in  his  speech\r\n\r\njust  now,  that the extended time up to  12  midnight\r\n\r\neach  day being asked for in the motion is to make  up\r\n\r\nfor  the  loss of two sitting days, this is an attempt\r\n\r\nto  wear out the Opposition and to deny the Opposition\r\n\r\nproper   facilities   to   prepare   criticisms    and\r\n\r\nobservations on the Estimates. We do not mind  sitting\r\n\r\nup  to  midnight every day, or even right up  to  6.00\r\n\r\na.m., as happened during the last sitting, but what we\r\n\r\ndo  mind is this. We are denied the facilities to make\r\n\r\na  detailed  study and to prepare our  criticisms  and\r\n\r\nobservations  on  the  amendments  which  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for discussion in the Committee of  Supply.\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked that the adjournment at 8.00\r\n\r\np.m. will provide the facilities which will be denied\r\n\r\nus if the Assembly adjourns at 12.00 midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his letter to the Speaker on 24th May, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance is prepared to have the  17th  of\r\n\r\nJune  as  the  last allotted day for the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply,  and yet in his motion now before  the  House,\r\n\r\nthe  last allotted day is fixed for the 14th of  June.\r\n\r\nWhy  this change of mind? To me, this means that since\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance is going to be  hanged,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mind how he is to be hanged. The Opposition\r\n\r\nis  aroused  and furious, and we are out to  hang  the\r\n\r\nGovernment constitutionally and declare that they  are\r\n\r\nwell and truly buried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of this unity in the Opposition against\r\n\r\nthis   dictatorial  and  arrogant  attitude   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it makes it necessary for me to draw  your\r\n\r\nattention to the practice of pairing off. I understand\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bras Basah will not be able to  attend\r\n\r\nAssembly sittings for some time, and I also can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand the feeling of the Barisan Sosialis  to  go\r\n\r\nto  the Government and ask for a pairing off. Inasmuch\r\n\r\nas  the  Government  will  never  go  to  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis for a pairing off, they always come to us. I,\r\n\r\nas a Member of the Opposition, feel that that enforced\r\n\r\nabsence from the Assembly should be paired off by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If they have had sufficient  training  in\r\n\r\nculture by their Minister for Culture, they would have\r\n\r\nno  doubt undertaken to pair off on their own. But  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government do not offer to pair off  against  the\r\n\r\nenforced absence of a Member of the Opposition, we  in\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance give this declaration to the Government:\r\n\r\nat no time will we pair off any more with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather\r\n\r\ncurious that the Member for Cairnhill should now  talk\r\n\r\nof  trying to bury the P.A.P. constitutionally. If the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. had  followed  an  anti-colonial   line   and\r\n\r\nconsistently  and  persistently carried  on  an  anti-colonial   fight,  there  would  not  have  been   the\r\n\r\nnecessity of debating this motion today. He  talks  of\r\n\r\naccepting the word of the Finance Minister in 1961 and\r\n\r\nsays  that  the  Minister for Finance has  now  broken\r\n\r\nfaith  with  him.  How? As far as I  can  see,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause they both are now trying to fight for the same\r\n\r\npiece  of  bone. That is all. It is their own inherent\r\n\r\ncontradiction, both trying to fight for the support of\r\n\r\nthe  masses  which they do not have. After  all,  what\r\n\r\ndoes  the  S.P.A. think the P.A.P. will do?  Does  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. think that the P.A.P. will allow the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  to  become  a member of  the  Cabinet?  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park might be taken in, because  he\r\n\r\nhas  been  seen  to  be  very chummy  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Anyway, Sir, it was the Member  for  Cairnhill  who  had  somersaulted  in  the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  thus allowing  the  P.A.P. to  push\r\n\r\nthrough  that Bill, rig the referendum and dishonestly\r\n\r\nand  undemocratically force the people  to  chose  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper.  It  is  always  good  to  talk  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  rising in united action, but I would  like\r\n\r\nto remind the S.P.A. that it is rather late in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe day to think of things like this.

But, of course, that  is\r\n\r\nnothing unusual. The manners of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance have been adequately expressed in\r\n\r\nthe letters that he sent to you, Sir,I do not think I\r\n\r\nneed  add  anything to that. From a normal adjournment\r\n\r\nperiod  of  at least seven clear days, the P.A.P. now\r\n\r\nwants  to  telescope this period into one of only  two\r\n\r\ndays,  because, if we leave out Sunday, it means  only\r\n\r\nSaturday  and Monday. As has already been pointed  out\r\n\r\nby the Member for Cairnhill, this is unprecedented not\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  history of Singapore but  also  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of all the parliamentary institutions  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  world.  And, of course, it  is  only  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that  we can get such unprecedented  practice.\r\n\r\nBut  I will enlarge on this later. Actually, according\r\n\r\nto  the  suggestion put forward by you.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthere should have been a debate on the 17th after  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  by the Finance  Minister.  Now  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister wants to make it the 11th. The  hours\r\n\r\ntoo  have been similarly rushed. From the normal hours\r\n\r\nit  has been extended to 12.00 midnight. That will, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  give no facilities and time to the Opposition\r\n\r\nto  carefully study and prepare for the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nmorrow.  This telescoping of the Budget debate,  which\r\n\r\ntook  10  days  in 1961, into just three days  further\r\n\r\nadds  to the difficulties of the Opposition in  giving\r\n\r\nan effective and detailed study of the Budget in order\r\n\r\nto  expose  all the things which the P.A.P. hopes  to\r\n\r\nhide and cover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what the hurry is. According to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  it  is because it wants to keep a time-table,\r\n\r\nand  according  to what the Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  many things have happened and many vital issues\r\n\r\nhave  cropped up. For what? In order that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmay  hand Singapore over to the Federation lock, stock\r\n\r\nand barrel, on time, ignoring completely the wishes of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and not giving them any chance whatsoever\r\n\r\nto  have a debate even on the Budget, something  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  every person in Singapore? Why  should  this\r\n\r\ntime-table  be  the  end  of June?  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance talks of the 31st of August. Does he not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is happening now as a result of the Tokyo talks?\r\n\r\nDoes he not know that the Manila talks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean no 31st of August? Does he not know that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole world is talking of the\r\n\r\npostponement of Malaysia. However much the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the Deputy Prime Minister of the\r\n\r\nFederation may insist on the 31st of August, it looks\r\n\r\nas if circumstances will force them to agree to a\r\n\r\npostponement, and the British themselves will\r\n\r\nsimilarly be forced to agree because it affects their\r\n\r\ninterests too. They would rather cut their losses by\r\n\r\npostponing Malaysia. And where does the P.A.P. come\r\n\r\nin? The P.A.P. hopes to go through this so-called time-table in order to have a chance to take an extra trip\r\n\r\nto London. It has been using the money of the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers for a long time, going on trips here and\r\n\r\nthere! It knows that after a certain date it will not\r\n\r\neven have a chance to go to the Federation with the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' money. I do not have to refer very much,\r\n\r\nSir, to the correspondence between you and the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. I think the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nhas already dealt with it adequately. But I wish to\r\n\r\nsay this, Sir,I wish to congratulate you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for not having knuckled down to the\r\n\r\narrogance of the P.A.P. If you had been -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But I would not like epithets to  be  thrown\r\n\r\naround and a debate entered into on my ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There was no such intention, Sir.\r\n\r\nBut this correspondence serves to throw new light on\r\n\r\nthe affairs of the State of Singapore. It is very\r\n\r\nrarely that you see a civil servant daring to answer\r\n\r\nback, so to speak, a Minister of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance talks of \"crucial difficulties\" and how the P.A.P. will have to iron out these difficulties in order to keep to its time-table in June. Why should the P.A.P. now try to give\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   impression  that  it  is  trying  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore? In hoping to win\r\n\r\nthe  support of the people of Singapore, it now  wants\r\n\r\nto  play tough, and to give the appearance that it has\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people at heart. But what is the\r\n\r\nuse  of talking of finance alone when the whole  thing\r\n\r\nhas  been  handed  over  to the  Federation?  You  are\r\n\r\ntalking  of  scratching your toes and feet  when  your\r\n\r\nhead  is already in the noose. If you want to get  rid\r\n\r\nof  these difficulties, the only way is to get rid  of\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper. You will then he really going to the\r\n\r\nroot  of  the problem and dealing with the essence  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  Once political control has  been  handed\r\n\r\nover  to the Federation, all talk of financial control\r\n\r\nis  mere  humbug. And in spite of the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance  on  financial  control,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has already indicated that he does not want to\r\n\r\nfight for financial control and according to -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Now I just want to say  that  all\r\n\r\nthis  talk  about  control is  nonsense,  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has  already  said,  \"What  is  the\r\n\r\ndifference  of a couple of millions between  friends?\"\r\n\r\nAll this is a play staged for the purpose of trying to\r\n\r\ngain  popular  support. I do not wish to  touch  on  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  points which the Member for Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nalready  dealt with, namely, that it is not  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nbe  present  when we discuss the Budget  Statement  or\r\n\r\ndebate  the  Budget in detail because - on  a  previous\r\n\r\noccasion I did mention this - the whole Government  does\r\n\r\nnot  depend on one or two Ministers. And you yourself,\r\n\r\nSir,   have  pointed  out  that  there  is  collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Cabinet in the  Government.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, Sir, I must also remind the Ministers opposite\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  had no sitting from the middle of July  last\r\n\r\nyear,  except  for a few-hour affair  on  the  5th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember, until the end of March this year,  and  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to insist on guillotining our debate  only\r\n\r\nshows   what  it  really  thinks  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.  We said at that time when the Assembly  was\r\n\r\nrecalled that this was due to public pressure. But, of\r\n\r\ncourse, the Prime Minister countered and said that  it\r\n\r\nwas not so. It was partly due to the insistence of the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Cairnhill.  And  mainly   because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had to endorse the constitutional agreement\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proves one very important point, that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. considers the role of the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nto be nothing hut a tool of the P.A.P. The Assembly is\r\n\r\nmerely to serve the P.A.P. to pass and endorse motions\r\n\r\nwhich  the P.A.P. wants to pass and nothing  else.  If\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. considers it not necessary to pass any law,\r\n\r\nany  regulation or any motion, then the Assembly  need\r\n\r\nnot  even  he  recalled. This alone  proves  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has   never  really  intended   to   practise\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy in Singapore. In fact, in this\r\n\r\nway,  the P.A.P. is doing its very best to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe   people   of   Singapore  are   not   given   the\r\n\r\nopportunities   and   facilities  for   constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle  and  practise parliamentary  democracy.  You\r\n\r\nwill remember, Sir, that debate of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  Speech was guillotined to a mere one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf days. Our motions on the February 2nd arrests and\r\n\r\nthe   inhuman  and  barbaric  treatment  of  political\r\n\r\ndetainees were not given a chance of a full and public\r\n\r\ndebate.  At  that time, the Prime Minister  said  that\r\n\r\nbecause  he had to go to the Federation for  important\r\n\r\nfinancial talks and that, because of the importance of\r\n\r\nthose  financial talks, therefore, the Assembly debate\r\n\r\nhad  to be cut short. But unfortunately for the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  following the quarrel with the M.C.A.,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  Siew Sin, the Finance Minister of the Federation,\r\n\r\nrevealed  that the Prime Minister merely  went  up  to\r\n\r\nplay  golf. He had never attended any of the financial\r\n\r\ntalks. Sir, this is a very important point because  it\r\n\r\nmeans that the Prime Minister was not telling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  May I remind you, Sir, of this  morning's\r\n\r\nnewspapers?  There  you  will  see  that  the  British\r\n\r\nMinister  for  War said he did not tell the  truth  in\r\n\r\nParliament; and consequent on that, the comment of all\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers in London is that lying in  the  House\r\n\r\n\"hits at the roots of government\" and that it \"reduces\r\n\r\nthe  public trust in Parliament\". Of course, with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in power, with its disregard of Standing Orders\r\n\r\nand  its  Fascist way of going about things, there  is\r\n\r\nalready no trust in the Assembly. The only question  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  raise  is  this.  Will  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsimilarly  have the courage to resign as the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor War in England has done?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But\r\n\r\nwhat  are the real reasons for this motion? The Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill has already mentioned the whole idea  of\r\n\r\nthis  guillotine. Telescoping of time-tables is  meant\r\n\r\nto  deny us in the Opposition sufficient time to  deal\r\n\r\nadequately and effectively with all the points we wish\r\n\r\nto raise in the Budget. It denies us adequate time for\r\n\r\ndetailed  study  of  the Budget.  Thus  they  hope  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  Opposition  from  further  exposing  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. But in spite of all that they may do, we  shall\r\n\r\nunravel and expose to the public gaze of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore what the P.A.P. has been trying to hide from\r\n\r\nthem.  Budget  time is Opposition time,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nexplained by the Member for Cairnhill, but the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwants to make it Government time. It wants to give  us\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  time possible and in so  doing  makes  a\r\n\r\nmockery  of all the tenets of parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nthat  we have in Singapore. There is a moral, a lesson\r\n\r\nin  what  has  happened today, Sir, and  that  is,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the present moment, there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nthing as the rule of law. The P.A.P., in fact, is  the\r\n\r\nlaw. As I have mentioned in the television forum,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  the  court,  is the  law,  is  everything.\r\n\r\nBecause of the arrogance -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Since we have not come to the\r\n\r\nEstimates and we are not discussing the provision  for\r\n\r\nthe   Television  service,  perhaps  the   Member   is\r\n\r\nanticipating  future discussions.

I only wanted the House to draw a moral,  a\r\n\r\nlesson,  from this. The P.A.P. is always arrogant  and\r\n\r\nundemocratic   and   always  resorts   to   the   most\r\n\r\nundemocratic methods in all that it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes. The law, as it stands in Singapore, today serves\r\n\r\nonly  the  P.A.P.  If according to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  it  becomes an encumbrance or  a  hindrance,\r\n\r\nthen,  of  course, the law goes. And the will  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. must be imposed regardless of all the  rulings\r\n\r\nand  the reasonable and legitimate opposition of other\r\n\r\npeople.  The P.A.P., of course, thinks only of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ninterests,  personal and sectional  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  and not of the interests of the people.  This\r\n\r\nis  Fascism in the raw and I would like to remind  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Ministers   that   merely   legalising   some\r\n\r\nundemocratic  act does not make that  act  democratic.\r\n\r\nAnd even if it should legally push through this motion\r\n\r\nand  guillotine  our debate, that does  not  make  the\r\n\r\nmotion democratic in any way. It is still Fascism  and\r\n\r\nI  would ask the P.A.P., before it completely gets out\r\n\r\nof  the  political stage in Singapore, not to  further\r\n\r\nsully the good name of this House by insisting on such\r\n\r\nundemocratic ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is\r\n\r\neasiest  to dispose of the points brought  up  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown, because, for the  most  part,\r\n\r\nwhat  he had to say has nothing to do with the  motion\r\n\r\nbefore   the  House  but  reads  something  like   the\r\n\r\nramblings  heard  from  the psychoanalyst's  couch.  I\r\n\r\nquite  understand his predicament, because not  having\r\n\r\nany   more  the  experienced  and  intelligent   ghost\r\n\r\nwriters, he just had to have a rehash of the collected\r\n\r\nworks  of  the Member for Queenstown which  have  been\r\n\r\naccumulating in this Assembly for the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is a simple one, Sir. As the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance has indicated, we have to finish this business\r\n\r\nof the Budget within a specific time, because, through\r\n\r\nno  fault  of  our  own,  the negotiations  have  been\r\n\r\nprotracted,  and it is necessary for the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  and the Prime Minister to be in Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nto  finalise  the  merger talks. We did  not  set  the\r\n\r\ndates.  Negotiations  went  on,  we  could  not  reach\r\n\r\nagreement,  and it is essential that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance indicate that the talks should be concluded in\r\n\r\ntime for the necessary instruments to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsigned in London by the end of this month. I can quite\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Member for Queenstown  relishing  the\r\n\r\nprospect of something happening to delay the talks  in\r\n\r\nLondon,  because the Barisan Sosialis attitude towards\r\n\r\nthese  talks,  towards Malaysia, is now  dependent  on\r\n\r\nsalvation  from  outside. They  always  say  yes,  the\r\n\r\ninternational  situation  is  going  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and merger will not come about as prescribed\r\n\r\non  31st  August. So if anything can  happen  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to make that possible, to postpone or  delay\r\n\r\nthe  signing  of  the  terms, the federation  and  the\r\n\r\nsigning of the instruments in London, he would be only\r\n\r\ntoo  happy.  He hopes some extraneous intervention  or\r\n\r\naccident  would  help  to  postpone  our  reaching   a\r\n\r\nsettlement on the basis of the White Paper and getting\r\n\r\nMalaysia through by 31st August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Cairnhill, it is quite\r\n\r\nobvious, Sir, what has been happening during the  past\r\n\r\nfew  weeks and I was not at all surprised that he  has\r\n\r\nbegun  his election campaign. The whole of his  speech\r\n\r\nwas  not bent on answering the legitimate points which\r\n\r\nwere  brought up by the Minister for Finance.  He  was\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Dictatorial P.A.P.!\" Apparently there  is  a\r\n\r\nfuneral parlour in Cairnhill because he is talking  of\r\n\r\nburying  the P.A.P., and generally spreading  euphoria\r\n\r\namong  his  own followers. Incidentally,  they  are  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit despondent themselves, because, as far as I\r\n\r\ncan gather, though the Grand Alliance has been formed,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill has not been able to get any\r\n\r\nentree  and therefore he has decided in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nto  espouse  the  cause of certain  gentlemen  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  who  have  other reasons  for  wanting  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  White Paper. Therefore, the plea  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill is that this Government  has  no\r\n\r\nmoral   right  either  to  conclude  talks  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government or to go to London, because  he\r\n\r\nfeels  that  he  would  like,  in  some  way,  to   be\r\n\r\nassociated  with what he knows is inevitable;  but  he\r\n\r\nand  his  now united front colleague, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, have for different reasons an interest  in\r\n\r\nthese   talks  which  are  essential  for  the  future\r\n\r\nsecurity of the people of Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia.  These talks are far more important  and\r\n\r\nessential for the safety and welfare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and therefore they have to get priority\r\n\r\nover any other thing. That has been the basis on which\r\n\r\nwe  have worked during the past two years, and because\r\n\r\nthe  time-table and schedule is not determined by  us,\r\n\r\nwe   have   therefore   put   forward   a   reasonable\r\n\r\nproposition.  Since  we have to carry  on  with  these\r\n\r\ntalks,  we  therefore bring forward this motion  which\r\n\r\nextends  the sittings up to midnight. It  is  true  it\r\n\r\ninconveniences the Opposition but it gives them  about\r\n\r\nthe  same length of time to discuss the Budget as they\r\n\r\nwould have if they had the other proposal of extending\r\n\r\nthe  period  by a couple of days, which would  however\r\n\r\npostpone  the more urgent talks over the White  Paper,\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill have to carry out with the Federation authorities\r\n\r\nand officials if we are to meet the London date-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure them, therefore, that though the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  now echoes  another  gentleman\r\n\r\noutside the shores of Singapore and suggests that  all\r\n\r\nthis  is  because the Prime Minister dare not confront\r\n\r\nhim,  obviously  the  \"Superman from  Cairnhill\",  the\r\n\r\n\"Tarzan  from Cairnhill\", suddenly from being  \"Mickey\r\n\r\nMouse\", thinks he has now become \"Superman\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I can assure him that if  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's sore throat - and that is the real reason\r\n\r\nfor his absence - has been cleared by then, there will\r\n\r\nbe   not  only  confrontation  with  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  but also it is more likely that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  would wish that he had  not  made  the\r\n\r\nrather silly challenges he made here. I can assure him\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister will be here to deal with  the\r\n\r\nrather interesting motion which is here in his name. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to anticipate that debate, but  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the Member for Cairnhill  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  undemocratic in asking the Opposition Members\r\n\r\nto debate until 12 midnight rather than in closing the\r\n\r\ndebate at 8 p.m. and resuming it the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown was also complaining that\r\n\r\nthis  was  not  democracy. The last  Assembly  sitting\r\n\r\nfinished on a rather melodramatic note when the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown talked for something like twelve hours.\r\n\r\nSir,  where  in  the  world is  an  Opposition  Member\r\n\r\nallowed  to  woolgather  in the  Assembly  for  twelve\r\n\r\nhours?  Yet  the  Members showed such  great  patience\r\n\r\nthat, not wishing to disturb him in his flow of words,\r\n\r\nthey kindly went outside the Chamber and slept it off.\r\n\r\nI  say,  Sir,  there is considerable  democracy  here.\r\n\r\nDemocracy means allowing anybody to say what he  likes\r\n\r\nfor as long as he likes. There is nothing undemocratic\r\n\r\nin  this  motion, though I would concede  that  it  is\r\n\r\ninconvenient.  I say, however, that that inconvenience\r\n\r\nis  small compared to the more vital task before  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  of seeing that the White Paper  terms  are\r\n\r\nspeedily concluded and that the necessary agreement is\r\n\r\nreached in time for the talks in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Member for Queens-town and the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill have announced a new united front\r\n\r\non  the  basis that if they do not hang together  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to  hang  separately. So  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  called  for  a  united  front  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   much   to   the   amusement   and    the\r\n\r\nconsternation of the Member for Queenstown. Let me ask\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill what would he say to this - we\r\n\r\ncan go on debating the Budget for as long as he likes,\r\n\r\nbut  that  would  mean unnecessary delay  in  reaching\r\n\r\nagreement on the talks over the White Paper.  Contrary\r\n\r\nto  what the Member for Cairnhill has indicated,  that\r\n\r\nwe  are somehow protracting the talks, it will he made\r\n\r\nclear,  when  the  facts, figures  and  documents  are\r\n\r\nproduced and when we debate his own motion, where  the\r\n\r\ndelay  is and who is responsible for it; whether  they\r\n\r\nare  his friends on whose behalf he speaks here today,\r\n\r\nor whether the delay is on our side. Let me assure the\r\n\r\nHouse,  but not the Barisan Sosialis, of this, because\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  see  how  they  can  stop  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. If they can do something here to delay that,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be only too happy to summon their  friends\r\n\r\noutside  this  country who have  tried  very  hard  to\r\n\r\npostpone  Malaysia. But even they have now to  concede\r\n\r\nthat although they still oppose Malaysia, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not  going  to  halt Malaysia.  That  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndepressing outlook for the Barisan Sosialis. We say to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members that though we regret, and  we\r\n\r\nadmit  that,  we have inconvenienced them by  adopting\r\n\r\nthis  procedure, it is not because we want to  or  are\r\n\r\nafraid  to  discuss  for one or  two  more  days,  but\r\n\r\nbecause the time-table is such that we have no  choice\r\n\r\nbut  to  proceed  as indicated in the  motion  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. I beg therefore to support  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the motion\r\n\r\nwhich the Minister has moved is that, firstly, it will\r\n\r\nshorten   the  time  for  the  study  of  the  Budget.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it will shorten the time for the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates,  and, thirdly, Sir,  but  not  in  the\r\n\r\nleast,  it  will  lessen  adverse  publicity  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far the reasons advanced for shortening the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Estimates is that the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance will have  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  talks  and that the timing  of  the  London\r\n\r\ntalks  is  such that a shorter sitting of the Assembly\r\n\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to say that these\r\n\r\nare reasons advanced merely to provide a cover, in the\r\n\r\nsame fashion as various reasons have been provided for\r\n\r\nall  their undemocratic and dictatorial acts. I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether    the   Government   Members   realise    the\r\n\r\nimplications of what they say. If they are saying that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Minister  for  Finance  and  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister have to be away, they are not able to sustain\r\n\r\nthe debate on the Estimates: they are, in fact, saying\r\n\r\nthat insofar as the Government is concerned, there are\r\n\r\nonly two men Who are capable of sustaining the debate.\r\n\r\nSurely the Minister for Finance is not suggesting that\r\n\r\nall the other Ministers, the Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nand  the  hack-benchers of the P.A.P. are  incompetent\r\n\r\nnincompoops!  They are not suggesting that  there  are\r\n\r\nonly  two  men  who have to carry the  burden  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  who have to be present here  to  transact\r\n\r\nGovernment business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  that all the others are \"passengers\", incompetent\r\n\r\nand incapable of looking after Government affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the simple implication of a motion of\r\n\r\nthis nature. We do not believe the Government was  not\r\n\r\naware  of the timing of the talks. This is yet another\r\n\r\nexample  of  P.A.P. dishonesty.  As  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has pointed out, the Government  had  ample\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  present these Estimates  long  before\r\n\r\nnow,  but  they  waited  for no  reason  at  all.  The\r\n\r\nEstimates   are  being  presented  at   this   moment,\r\n\r\naccording to them, two months before Malaysia; and  on\r\n\r\nthe  pretext of hurry, urgency, they want to deny  the\r\n\r\nOpposition their rightful time for a proper debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we oppose this motion because we know that this\r\n\r\nis  yet  another example of the manner  in  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Members have been conducting themselves in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. This is just another example of the  conduct\r\n\r\nof  a Government which claims to defend the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  If  it  were  an exception,  it  would  be  a\r\n\r\ndifferent matter. I am sure everybody in Singapore and\r\n\r\nevery Member in this House knows that this is not  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  the  Government  has  attempted  to  curb\r\n\r\ndebates  by  introducing motions of this  nature.  The\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  was  a  good\r\n\r\nexample.  The  debates on the Address  normally  lasts\r\n\r\nabout  a  week;  we had only about a day.  The  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Member for Queenstown on  the  arrests\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  February was forced  to  be  debated\r\n\r\nwithin  a  short time and at a time when the publicity\r\n\r\nwhich  had  been adverse to the Government  was  at  a\r\n\r\nminimum. There are many other examples, Sir, which  we\r\n\r\nhave  witnessed from time to time; and far from  being\r\n\r\nan  exception, it has become the rule of the  day  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  They  hope that by virtue  of  the  small\r\n\r\nmajority  and  the  strength that they  have  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, they could from time to time move guillotine\r\n\r\nmotions - motions that will mean the Opposition has less\r\n\r\ntime  or no time at all to bring out the dirt  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, that will prevent exposures being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we all remember how eloquently the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has talked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout confrontation. One of his favourite acclamations\r\n\r\nis  that the Government fear no open debate. I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the reason why today they are trying to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition from sufficiently exposing them in the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Estimates  is  that  they  fear  open\r\n\r\ndebates.  Only recently there was a very good  example\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.'s courage to meet us in  open  debate.\r\n\r\nThey   turned  down  an  invitation  by  the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Social Science Society for a forum. All the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. representatives   were   not   there.    Open\r\n\r\nconfrontation!  They only dare have it perhaps  within\r\n\r\nthe confines of Radio Singapore. Even there, Sir, they\r\n\r\ndo  not suggest as many forums as they did once.  They\r\n\r\nhave  turned  down an invitation by the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya Socialist Club for a forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the recent examples. There\r\n\r\nhave been examples of banning of rallies, because they\r\n\r\nfear that we will inform the people of things and acts\r\n\r\nof  this  Government which will be  adverse  to  their\r\n\r\npolitical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the newspapers gagged. Men who claim to\r\n\r\nwelcome  open  debate have the newspapers  gagged  and\r\n\r\nhave got them to play down Opposition views which  are\r\n\r\nadverse to the P.A.P. interest, and play up Government\r\n\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the attempt which is being made\r\n\r\nnow  in this Assembly is in the same way motivated  by\r\n\r\nfear  of the Government of open debate. Sir, to  them,\r\n\r\nopen confrontation means, tie the giant down in chains\r\n\r\nand  then they come in as heroes. We tell them to have\r\n\r\nthe  basic courage necessary for a man. Play the  game\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  rules. If we are  given  the  same\r\n\r\nrights and privileges that they give themselves, in no\r\n\r\ntime people like the Minister for Culture will have to\r\n\r\ngo  back  to his rubber estate somewhere in  Seremban.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister for Finance will have to go  back\r\n\r\nto his stock-broker company business, and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education to his insurance company business. There\r\n\r\nwill be no P.A.P. then, and perhaps the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwill be at number 10-B Malacca Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It is unprecedented for any government to  deny\r\n\r\nOpposition  time to debate the Estimates.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown has said there are many  skeletons  in\r\n\r\nthe  cupboard, and that is why they fear. We are  told\r\n\r\nthat  the  sittings  will be up to midnight  and  that\r\n\r\ntherefore the total time will be the same. Sir, if the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government is to give the same length\r\n\r\nof  time  in  number of hours as we would have  if  we\r\n\r\nfollowed  the  normal course, why does the  Government\r\n\r\nnot  suggest sitting in the morning instead of sitting\r\n\r\nafter 8 p.m.? They do not suggest  - I am not suggesting\r\n\r\nthey do this - sitting, say, from 8 in the morning up to\r\n\r\n4  in  the  afternoon. Why do they not  suggest  this?\r\n\r\nThere  is a very good reason why they suggest that  we\r\n\r\nsit  from  8 p.m. up to midnight. One reason  is  that\r\n\r\nthey want to give the impression that they are fair -\r\n\r\nthey  want to make up for the time: they want to  give\r\n\r\nthe   public   the  impression  that  they   are   not\r\n\r\ndictatorial,  that  they  do  not  want  to  deny  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  of their time. That is one of the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  they  try  to  extend the time  from  8  p.m. to\r\n\r\nmidnight,  but  particularly from 8 p.m. to  midnight\r\n\r\nbecause the Press will not publish many of the  things\r\n\r\nthat are said after 8 p.m. in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, the Government fear\r\n\r\npublicity  which is adverse to them, and  though  they\r\n\r\nhave  the Press gagged, it is inevitable for the Press\r\n\r\nto carry or give the Opposition at least more coverage\r\n\r\nthan they give for the normal times of a sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we firmly reject this motion, for acceptance\r\n\r\nwould  simply  mean  making a farce  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must say that any attempt by the Government to\r\n\r\ndeny  us  sufficient time for a study of the Estimates\r\n\r\nand preparation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor a proper debate of the Estimates will  be\r\n\r\nrejected  by us. If the Government have no confidence,\r\n\r\nif  the  absence  of two Members will mean  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot sustain the debate, then the logical thing  for\r\n\r\nthem to do is to quit office. We are satisfied that if\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance  want\r\n\r\nto  go on further golfing trips, it is their business.\r\n\r\nWe  are  further  satisfied that there are  sufficient\r\n\r\nMembers  on the Government side who should be able  to\r\n\r\nmanage the affairs of the Government in their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to end by saying this: if the P.A.P. had one\r\n\r\nachievement  since  1959, it  is  to  have  thoroughly\r\n\r\ndiscredited the democratic system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir.

Very often,  the  rules\r\n\r\nare  in favour of the Government since virtually  they\r\n\r\nare  in the majority, but at times the rules are meant\r\n\r\nto protect the Opposition. In the case of Budget time,\r\n\r\nthe   Standing  Orders  are  laid  down  so  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition may have adequate time to study the  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement and the Budget Estimates and he able  to  do\r\n\r\njustice to the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, we have seen the tendency of the\r\n\r\nParty in power to honour democracy with their lips but\r\n\r\nnot  with  deeds,  and,  in this particular  instance,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  observance  of  parliamentary  procedure\r\n\r\nwould  mean  some inconvenience to the  leaders,  they\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to  put  party  interests  before   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  parliamentary democracy  and  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying to cut down on the rights of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in previous years, the P.A.P. tried to stifle\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  by smears, ridicule and  the  use  of\r\n\r\nintimidatory language. Today, they seek to reduce  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the Opposition by this motion  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse. It seems to me that they are still applying the\r\n\r\nprinciple that as they can inflict arbitrary pay  cuts\r\n\r\non  their  own  workers,  they can  therefore  inflict\r\n\r\narbitrary cuts in the time of the opposition in  spite\r\n\r\nof the protection accorded us by the Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where are the safeguards in future if this\r\n\r\nintolerant attitude is unopposed? If the rights  of  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary Opposition can be reduced or ignored  at\r\n\r\nwill  by  the  Party in power for its own convenience,\r\n\r\nthe same thing can happen to the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nThere  will  then  be no assurance of  fair  play  and\r\n\r\njustice  because the ruling Party will then be  a  law\r\n\r\nunto  themselves.  They can rise  above  certain  laws\r\n\r\nmeant  to  protect  the rights  of  other  people.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the Government side will say that by extending\r\n\r\nthe  time  to  midnight  each day  they  have  thereby\r\n\r\nprovided  sufficient time for debate.  Actually,  this\r\n\r\nmakes matters worse from the Opposition point of view,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know very well that the daily papers  can\r\n\r\nonly  print  so much about what happens in this  house\r\n\r\nper day, and that the speeches of the Ministers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be given full play. In three  days'  time,\r\n\r\nmore  Ministers will speak with less space  available,\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  the speeches of  Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nwill be either pushed out for lack of space or just  a\r\n\r\nfew  paragraphs or a few lines are reported.  So  this\r\n\r\narrangement proposed by the Minister for Finance  will\r\n\r\nwork badly for the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know very well that the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nwith  all their experts have been able to work  out  a\r\n\r\nstrategy in the use of their radio and television,  so\r\n\r\nthat  it becomes a fine art to them as to how best  to\r\n\r\nput  forward  the image of the P.A.P. to  the  people\r\n\r\nthrough speeches made regularly at official functions.\r\n\r\nHere again, it seems as if this is a way by which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side is trying to bolster themselves up  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Culture has, through\r\n\r\nexperience,   developed  a  skill  in   twisting   the\r\n\r\nstatements  of Opposition Members. This time,  he  has\r\n\r\nmanaged  to twist the opposition to this motion  as  a\r\n\r\nunited front against Malaysia. I think that is totally\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir,I\r\n\r\nnever said that it was a united front against Malaysia\r\n\r\nbut that it was a united front of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad he\r\n\r\nhas clarified that part because the indirect inference\r\n\r\nwas  that  we  have  now become united  in  an  unholy\r\n\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the preservation of the freedom of\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of  the  people and  the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   naturally   the   Opposition    Members,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  party affiliations,  must  be  united,\r\n\r\notherwise  there will be no Opposition at all  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  We  on  this  side  of  the  House   want   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Opposition regardless of whichever  Party\r\n\r\nis  in  power, and it seems to me that if the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  was really interested in preserving  the\r\n\r\nrights of the Opposition, he would have consulted  the\r\n\r\nOpposition leaders and presented his case, so that  if\r\n\r\nthere  was really no way out, I am sure the Opposition\r\n\r\nleaders  would have been only too glad to  accommodate\r\n\r\nhim.

When the Minister for Finance wrote to you, could he not have expected the type of reply he\r\n\r\nwould  get  from  you? Could the Government  not  have\r\n\r\nknown  in  advance  the  provisions  of  the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders?  I believe that when the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwrote  to you he already guessed what your reply would\r\n\r\nbe.  Therefore,  the whole motive of the  Government's\r\n\r\nletter  to  you  is to create an impression  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to give sufficient  time  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to debate the Budget and that it intends to\r\n\r\nhold    the   sittings   earlier,   but   that,   very\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the  Speaker  refuses  to  allow   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do so according to the Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\nso that no blame will be attached to the Government. I\r\n\r\nam  of  the  opinion that the Government is playing  a\r\n\r\npolitical game which is rather mean. This incident  is\r\n\r\nnot the first one. It is a second incident, because in\r\n\r\nFebruary   this  year  when  the  Opposition   Members\r\n\r\nrequested  an emergency sitting of this Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the Party in power, knowing very well  that\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly was in recess, did not want to say  that\r\n\r\nhe  would not like to convene a special sitting but he\r\n\r\nwrote a letter to you requesting for a special sitting\r\n\r\nof the Assembly so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  had  to refuse the convening of a special sitting\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Standing Orders.  Therefore,  this\r\n\r\naction of the Government in February was also intended\r\n\r\nto create an impression that the Government was not to\r\n\r\nbe blamed for not having convened a special sitting. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that this kind of mean tactics by the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower in a parliamentary democracy should be condemned\r\n\r\nby this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a small matter. It is not a very easy\r\n\r\nmatter  to  discuss financial business and the  Budget\r\n\r\nbecause   the  Budget  provides  for  every  item   of\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure in a whole year. So it is not a\r\n\r\ntrifle.  If the Government want to show up the  merits\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary democracy, then they should give the\r\n\r\nOpposition  sufficient time to prepare for and  debate\r\n\r\nthis very important business of the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago, the Minister for Culture said\r\n\r\nthat  we oppose the present motion because we want  to\r\n\r\ndelay  merger. He was not correct in saying  that.  We\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition oppose the motion because we\r\n\r\nwant  to  protect and safeguard our legitimate rights.\r\n\r\nIf  the  motion  by the Minister for Finance  has  not\r\n\r\ninfringed upon the rights of the Opposition,  then  we\r\n\r\nin  the Opposition will not have reason to condemn the\r\n\r\nmotion irrespective of our Party affiliations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nvery  sorry  to say that this Legislative Assembly  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  now  been reduced to  nothing;  it  is\r\n\r\nmerely  a rubber stamp of the P.A.P.

When\r\n\r\nit  suits  their  purpose, it  is  convened  at  their\r\n\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, were it not for the fact that this Government\r\n\r\nrequires  this Assembly by this month to  supply  them\r\n\r\nwith  the  funds  to carry on the government,  and  at\r\n\r\nother  occasions to pass laws in order  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  administration or to repress the Opposition,  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  this Assembly might not even  be  convened\r\n\r\nonce a year as provided for under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now very little left of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  and  what has happened here  is  a  living\r\n\r\nmockery of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  and  its  contempt  for  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system. During the past two  years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  noticed  that whenever sittings  are  held,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  has  used  every  means  at   its\r\n\r\ndisposal,  every  contrivance  it  can  think  of,  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  and reduce the time for the Opposition:  for\r\n\r\ninstance,   the  introduction  of  the   12   midnight\r\n\r\nguillotine  motion  at almost every  sitting  and  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  tactics which it can think of, so that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  will have as little time  as  possible  to\r\n\r\nventilate the views of the people they represent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that every speech we make after 7\r\n\r\np.m. or  8  p.m. finds little space in the  following\r\n\r\nmorning's paper. This does not mean that speeches made\r\n\r\nbefore 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. find a fair representation  in\r\n\r\nthe papers. [Interruption] The main purpose of this 12\r\n\r\no'clock  midnight guillotine is that it  provides  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture with a good reason to direct  the\r\n\r\nPress not to give space to speeches made after 7  p.m.\r\n\r\nor 8 p.m. This has happened especially during the past\r\n\r\none year, and that is why during the past one year  we\r\n\r\nhave always seen the Government moving motions to have\r\n\r\nall-night sittings and debates lasting to 12 midnight.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  mean  that  we cannot  stand  all-night\r\n\r\ndebates or sittings lasting to 12 midnight. I think we\r\n\r\nare quite experienced in these matters. [Interruption]\r\n\r\nI  think we are physically stronger than the Ministers\r\n\r\npresent  in this building. But we know that the  whole\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this exercise is to stifle  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and to repress the views of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  today  the Opposition  are  all  united\r\n\r\nagainst this move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is the Government so scared? Why is it so\r\n\r\nafraid  of giving a fairer and adequate period to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to express their views? What has it got  to\r\n\r\nhide?  What has it been guilty of?

Today's motion  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance is to curb the Opposition's\r\n\r\ntime on the debate on the Budget and the Estimates. It\r\n\r\nhas  been  recognised in parliamentary democracy  that\r\n\r\nBudget time is Opposition time. Today's instance shows\r\n\r\nhow  desperate  these  men are.  They  will  make  any\r\n\r\nattempt,  no  matter  how low it is,  to  repress  and\r\n\r\nsuppress the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Keep on talking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will not be long.

The  people do not believe in the  Government\r\n\r\nany  more.  They had so many months to introduce  this 1963   Budget.  \r\n\r\nThey  could  have  introduced  it   in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  October, November, or December last  year.\r\n\r\nWe  have  had  no meetings for many months.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened is that, as far as I know, for the first time\r\n\r\nin  the history of Parliament, a Government has  spent\r\n\r\nmoney in advance for six months and then come to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly begging and saying, \"Come on, do not talk  so\r\n\r\nmuch.  Just speak for three days and forget about  it.\r\n\r\nLet us have the money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with regret that\r\n\r\nI  cannot see eye to eye with the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\non  this  motion.  In any Session, in a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  the  two  most important  events  are  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Head of State and the Budget debate. The\r\n\r\nfirst  one - the  speech of Head of State - sets  out  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  State for the ensuing year;  and  the\r\n\r\nBudget - the  financial statement by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance - sets  out  the financial arrangements  whereby\r\n\r\nthe policy of the Government can be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Standing Orders, it is incumbent on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  see that the  Assembly  does  not\r\n\r\ndebate  the  speech of the Head of State  until  seven\r\n\r\nclear  days  have passed. Similarly with that  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  statement  by  the  Finance  Minister,  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders impose an obligation on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe Government, and therefore a corresponding right to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, to see that no debate ensues  on  the\r\n\r\nfinancial statement until a lapse of seven clear days.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, it is for some definite specific  reason\r\n\r\nthat  time  is  given to Members of the Opposition  so\r\n\r\nthat  they might study these two important statements,\r\n\r\none  by the Head of State and the other by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, for seven clear days and consult among Party\r\n\r\nmembers   and  come  prepared  to  debate  those   two\r\n\r\nstatements  in an intelligent and constructive  manner\r\n\r\nthat  will help not only the Government, but  possibly\r\n\r\nthe  country  at  large;  so  that  what  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister is asking the Opposition to do in his  motion\r\n\r\nis  to  give  up its right in this matter.  There  are\r\n\r\noccasions when it is right for the Government  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition to give up certain of its rights.  But\r\n\r\nwhen such a request is made. I think it is only proper\r\n\r\ncourtesy  and  fair  play that  the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nshould give adequate reasons for so asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the time given in this matter is not so much a\r\n\r\nquestion of the Opposition trying to get the better of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  We are being given  sufficient  time\r\n\r\nunder  the Standing Orders, which is the sum total  of\r\n\r\nhuman  experience in parliamentary democracy,  because\r\n\r\nto  debate  a financial statement, which is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  thing in the financial life of  a  country,\r\n\r\none  has to have time to study it, think about it  and\r\n\r\nthen debate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the Finance Minister ask us to do in this\r\n\r\nmotion?  He  is going to deliver his statement  today,\r\n\r\napparently,  and we have to come back on  Tuesday  and\r\n\r\ndebate  it  intelligently, I hope, and  thereafter  to\r\n\r\ndebate the Budget Estimates on three successive  days,\r\n\r\nand on each day sitting up to 12 o'clock midnight.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt, the time asked for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequates  to the time given under the Standing  Orders.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  made great play about  that  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  what are you complaining about? You  have  got\r\n\r\nthe  time  allotted under the Standing Orders  by  our\r\n\r\ngiving  you three sittings and extending the  time  on\r\n\r\neach  day.\"  But he did not explain away  the  erosion\r\n\r\ninto  the  seven-day period of time which is given  to\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition to study the statement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister. That has not been accounted for\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the reasons the Finance Minister has\r\n\r\ngiven  in  asking the House to approve this motion  of\r\n\r\nhis? Frankly, Sir, I was disappointed with his speech,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very  curt, and, if I might  say  so,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsomewhat  arrogant and not courteous to the  House  at\r\n\r\nall, particularly to the Opposition. He is asking  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  agree with him on a  motion  which  is\r\n\r\nabridging  the rights of the Opposition  on  a  matter\r\n\r\nsuch  as  this, and he does not even have the courtesy\r\n\r\nto  give good coherent reasons as to why he wants  it.\r\n\r\nAll  that I understood him to say was, \"I the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister want it this way; therefore, you agree to it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you have had it.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, that  is\r\n\r\nno  way  to  treat the Opposition in this matter.  His\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Culture, tried to come  to\r\n\r\nhis assistance and did try to give some reasons as  to\r\n\r\nwhy the Opposition should agree with this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the Prime Minister and the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance have got to go to the Federation for important\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the Federation Government, and  after\r\n\r\nthat, it would appear that both the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister have got to go  to  London  and\r\n\r\nconduct talks there and conclude an agreement, all  of\r\n\r\nwhich  should happen, so it seems, before the 30th  of\r\n\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, why cannot the Minister for Finance, having delivered his Budget statement today, go off with the Prime Minister to the Federation and come back eight days later and deal with the Estimates? There is nothing to prevent him from doing this; absolutely nothing. No doubt he has certain\r\n\r\nBills. Under the Orders of the Day he has a number  of\r\n\r\nBills  which he is going to move. He is going to  take\r\n\r\nthe Second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Third  Readings  of  the  Singapore  Society   of\r\n\r\nAccountants  Bill  standing in his name.  He  is  also\r\n\r\nmoving  the  Second and Third Readings of  the  Rubber\r\n\r\nEstates Assessment (Amendment) Bill. He is also  going\r\n\r\nto take - or is he going to take, or is his deputy going\r\n\r\nto  take -   the  Financial Procedure  (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\n(Minister for Finance) - Second Reading. Then again, the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Integration Bill, Second Reading: the\r\n\r\nPlanning     (Amendment)    Bill     (Minister     for\r\n\r\nFinance) - Second  Reading. The Housing and  Development\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Bill   (Minister  for  Finance) - Second\r\n\r\nReading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, is he going to take all these Bills in this\r\n\r\nHouse, or is his Parliamentary Secretary going to take\r\n\r\nthem?  I  dare  say his Parliamentary Secretary  could\r\n\r\nhave  taken  these  Bills and,  as  his  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has done on other occasions,  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  have gone off to the Federation, concluded  his\r\n\r\nbusiness  there  and,  as  far  as  we  can  see  from\r\n\r\nstatements in the Press by the Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance from time to time, everything  is\r\n\r\ngoing on swimmingly. All it needs now are a couple  of\r\n\r\nmeetings. That is all we hear from the Press. A couple\r\n\r\nof  meetings  and everything will be all right.  In  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  meetings  everything  will  be  tied   up.\r\n\r\nCorrect.  In  seven days they can  hold  more  than  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of meetings. And the Minister for Finance  can\r\n\r\ncome  back  fortified  that he has  reached  financial\r\n\r\narrangements   with  the  Federation  and   face   the\r\n\r\nOpposition calmly, coolly and collectedly. Instead  of\r\n\r\nwhich he takes the other course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree. I think the\r\n\r\ntruth  of the matter is that the Minister has made  up\r\n\r\nhis  mind that this is what he wants and this is  what\r\n\r\nhe  thinks he is going to get. I dare say he will push\r\n\r\nit  through,  but  he will push it through  against  a\r\n\r\njoint Opposition stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another excuse on which the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  sought to exculpate himself. He said that  he\r\n\r\nhad  tried to get an earlier sitting, and that he  had\r\n\r\nfailed  because an earlier sitting was not allowed  on\r\n\r\nthe grounds which he had suggested it could be called.\r\n\r\nMr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, you have ruled on it and I accept  your\r\n\r\nruling. Might I ask the Minister for Finance, when  he\r\n\r\ndoes  reply  to his motion, why is it that his  Budget\r\n\r\ncould  not have been presented much earlier? There  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no reason that I can find today  why  this\r\n\r\nBudget could not have been presented in December 1962.\r\n\r\nWe  gave the Government a Vote on Account for the year\r\n\r\n1963.  The  reason  given to the Opposition  was  that\r\n\r\nofficials  were  going to be so busy on administrative\r\n\r\nmatters  connected with integration that  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible to spare them. Subsequent events proved  that\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister was unduly pessimistic  in  his\r\n\r\nstatement to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House feel that this Budget\r\n\r\ncould  quite  easily  have been presented  months  and\r\n\r\nmonths  ago.  It  could  easily  have  been  presented\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to ask the House to give  a  Vote  on\r\n\r\nAccount for the first six months of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Opposition is concerned, we feel that\r\n\r\nthis  motion  is completely unnecessary,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nnormal  time  set  by  the Standing  Orders  had  been\r\n\r\nfollowed, the Prime Minister and the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  have  concluded their business  in  the  places\r\n\r\nwhere  they had wanted to go to. If they had not  been\r\n\r\nin  the  House  and  if there was  a  suggestion  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the equality of the number  of  votes  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  Opposition, surely pairs  could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  arranged for the Prime Minister and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance. That has been done previously. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  paired off today with  someone  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. And if the Opposition had been  told  that\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister and the Prime Minister had to  be\r\n\r\naway  in  the  Federation and in England on  important\r\n\r\nState  business,  surely, Sir,  some  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  would  have paired off with  them.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Sir, this motion is completely unnecessary  and\r\n\r\nall that it is intended to do and will, in fact, do is\r\n\r\nto stifle discussion on the Budget Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend\r\n\r\nto  dwell at length on the boisterous remarks made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill. Obviously he is under  some\r\n\r\nillusion that the position of his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty is stronger than it actually is, but he has  got\r\n\r\nthe  time dates all mixed up in attacking the  motion.\r\n\r\nNow,  may  I  get the dates right because  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  some importance? The Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nsaid  that when we asked for a Vote on Account,  there\r\n\r\nwas an indication from me that the Budget, when it was\r\n\r\ndelivered,  would  have contained  certain  provisions\r\n\r\nallowing  for  a division of expenditure  and  revenue\r\n\r\nbetween   the   State  Government  and   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment, and he found what he termed an undertaking\r\n\r\nfrom me had not been carried out. I think it should be\r\n\r\nremembered  that the Vote on Account was  approved  by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly on 4th December, 1961, just  after  the\r\n\r\nmerger  terms of the White Paper had been agreed  upon\r\n\r\nand  we  were by no means certain by what date  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation could have been achieved. At that\r\n\r\nmoment,  31st August, 1963, was not on the  cards.  It\r\n\r\ncould well have been a much earlier date, and in  that\r\n\r\nevent  a completely different form of Estimates  would\r\n\r\nhave been presented to the Assembly. But events having\r\n\r\ntaken  their course, it is obvious that for the  major\r\n\r\npart of this year Singapore will remain in its present\r\n\r\nconstitutional  position and  therefore,  under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it was not possible to allocate revenue\r\n\r\nand   expenditure  between  the  State   and   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernments,  more particularly so as  he  knows  that\r\n\r\nfinal   agreement  has  not  been  reached  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great play has been made by the Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  that  the  present  difficulties  in   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  talks  consist largely of make-believe  and\r\n\r\nplay-acting. Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody would be happier\r\n\r\nthan I if in fact these difficulties were not real.  I\r\n\r\ncan assure the Member for Cairnhill and the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  that we have run into real difficulties,\r\n\r\nthat   representatives   of  both   Governments   held\r\n\r\ngenuinely and honestly to their respective stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter is this. It is not a question\r\n\r\nof  Government  wanting  to repress  or  suppress  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  deny them of their rights  at  Budget\r\n\r\ntime.  If  that was the case, how is it  that  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on this motion the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeakers between themselves have occupied no more than\r\n\r\ntwenty  minutes and the Opposition speakers  have  had\r\n\r\nnearly three hours' run of time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Guilty conscience.

I  readily  admit,  and   I\r\n\r\nconceded  at  the  beginning,  that  there  would   be\r\n\r\ninconvenience.  This inconvenience would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nborne  not only by the Opposition speakers but by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment benches as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of the matter is this. Is this a dodge to\r\n\r\ndeny  the  Opposition the time and the right to  speak\r\n\r\nand the right to publicity in the newspapers? The real\r\n\r\nreason  is that a real urgency has been brought  about\r\n\r\nby   difficulties  which  we  have  run  into  in  our\r\n\r\nfinancial talks with the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, perhaps, if I could give exact dates, I may be\r\n\r\nable  to  convince,  if  not  other  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, at least the Member for Farrer Park, whose\r\n\r\nopinion is esteemed on this side of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-table for the next constitutional process\r\n\r\nover  Malaysia  is to have an agreed document  by  the\r\n\r\n27th  of  this month. If we were to continue with  the\r\n\r\noriginal  time-table, the Assembly would complete  its\r\n\r\ndeliberations on the Budget on the 23rd of June.  Now,\r\n\r\nis  it humanly possible, Mr Speaker, Sir, to clear up\r\n\r\nall  outstanding  issues  between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation in two days - the 24th and possibly the 25th?\r\n\r\nThe Member for Farrer Park says that it could be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> You said so.

The date for the initialling of  the\r\n\r\nTreaty is an important one, because there again it  is\r\n\r\nlinked  to the parliamentary time-table of the British\r\n\r\nParliament,  taking into account that in August  there\r\n\r\nwill  be a recess, after which, of course, it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to carry on with the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park says, \"Well, why not\r\n\r\ncarry  on according to the original time-table?  After\r\n\r\ntoday's speech, then the Minister for Finance  can  go\r\n\r\noff tomorrow, or the day after.\" Well, there is not  a\r\n\r\nchance, because the Chairman of the Inter-Governmental\r\n\r\nCommittee,  Tun Razak, who is now in Manila,  will  be\r\n\r\naway for perhaps a week or so. So I do wish to impress\r\n\r\non the House, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the time-table is\r\n\r\nextremely tight, that vital issues are at stake, and I\r\n\r\nreject completely the suggestion that this is a  dodge\r\n\r\nto  deprive  the Opposition of time and publicity.  It\r\n\r\nwas  recklessly  suggested  by  some  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan, and I think possibly the Member for Hong Lim,\r\n\r\nthat  there has been in some way a breach of the rules\r\n\r\nof procedure or a flouting of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\nIf this were the case, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  you  are  the  person  who  is  guilty  of  such\r\n\r\nbreaches,  because the time-table that we adopted  for\r\n\r\nquickening this Budget session was at your suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Government has this week completed\r\n\r\nits  fourth year in office. Many momentous events have\r\n\r\ntaken  place during this period. And now we  stand  on\r\n\r\nthe very threshold of independence through merger with\r\n\r\nthe  future Federation of Malaysia. Although, at  this\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  constitutional  arrangements  concerning\r\n\r\nfinance  have not reached finality, I am hopeful  that\r\n\r\non  the resumption of talks, final agreement would  be\r\n\r\nreached.  Only  two outstanding issues  remain  to  be\r\n\r\nsettled,  namely, the quantum of our contribution  for\r\n\r\nFederal services, and the terms under which the common\r\n\r\nmarket  is  to be established. While it is unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat at this very late moment agreement could not have\r\n\r\nbeen  reached on these matters, we should not overlook\r\n\r\nthe   fact  that  discussions  in  the  official  sub-committees  and in the plenary sessions of the  inter-Governmental committee had resolved successfully  many\r\n\r\ncomplex   and   intricate  problems  to   the   mutual\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of both Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In presenting the Budget for 1963, I recognise that\r\n\r\nthere  must  necessarily  be  less  interest  in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates  now  before the House than  is  usual.  The\r\n\r\nobvious  reason is that nearly half the year is  over.\r\n\r\nWhat the House is asked to ap-prove \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  really to provide finance for the remaining\r\n\r\nsix  months of 1963. In December, 1961 the House voted\r\n\r\nand approved a vote on account for expenditure for the\r\n\r\nfirst half of this year. For reasons I have explained,\r\n\r\nit was not possible then to present the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such being the case, I wish, in this speech to\r\n\r\ndevote  more  time  to  an examination  of  the  basic\r\n\r\nfinancial and economic problems confronting the  State\r\n\r\nthan  to  discussing the details of the Estimates.  In\r\n\r\ndoing so, I would like to undertake a review of events\r\n\r\nin  the last four years and assess the performance  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  against  the  financial  and\r\n\r\neconomic policies on which it was elected to office in\r\n\r\n1959.  I  will also attempt a pre-forecast of probable\r\n\r\ntrends after Malaysia, although this forecast must, in\r\n\r\nthe  nature of things, be tentative. Nevertheless,  it\r\n\r\nis  worth  making it, if only to discover  the  limits\r\n\r\nwithin   which  the  future  financial  and   economic\r\n\r\nprogress our State is likely to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It falls outside my province to review progress in\r\n\r\nthe lion-economic aspects of our programme such as the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter,  labour  legislation,  the  work  of\r\n\r\nnation  building, educational progress and other  non-economic  matters.  I shall refer  to  these  only  in\r\n\r\npassing  and in so far as they have relevance  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic and financial policies of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Basic Problems</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, we saw with far more insight than other\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties what the basic problems  were  that\r\n\r\nfaced  Singapore  then.  On  the  economic  side,  the\r\n\r\nproblem stems from the high rate of population  growth\r\n\r\nin  the  postwar  years. The average  annual  increase\r\n\r\nbetween  1947/57 was 4.3 per cent, a rate higher  than\r\n\r\nthat known to be achieved by any country in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This population explosion, as it is commonly known,\r\n\r\nbrought  about two sets of immediate problems  to  the\r\n\r\nState.  The first is to maintain a rate of expenditure\r\n\r\non the social services - health, education, housing - to\r\n\r\nmaintain a rate on these services adequate to keep  up\r\n\r\nwith population growth and to allow for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is to create a sustained rate of\r\n\r\neconomic   growth   which   would   afford   increased\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities to absorb the  thousands  of\r\n\r\nyoung men and women who would be looking for work each\r\n\r\nyear. In 1959 we told the electorate (and I quote from\r\n\r\nThe Tasks Ahead, Part I, page 19):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although unemployment is a serious problem now, it\r\n\r\nis  trivial when compared with what would happen after\r\n\r\n1962  if  no steps are taken now to expand the economy\r\n\r\nand increase opportunities for work.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem, that is expanding the social\r\n\r\nservices, is a comparatively straightforward one  from\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  view of finance. It  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfinding  money to pay for new schools and  houses  and\r\n\r\nclinics  and to pay for the salaries of the  teachers,\r\n\r\nnurses,  doctors  and other personnel  that  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired.  And this is possible, if we were  to  avoid\r\n\r\npunitive  increases in taxation,  only  in  a  bouyant\r\n\r\neconomy yielding increasing revenues to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem of economic expansion is a more\r\n\r\nintricate one. It is a problem common to all the newly\r\n\r\nindependent countries of Asia and Africa. This is  the\r\n\r\nproblem    of    sustaining   economic    growth    of\r\n\r\nunderdeveloped countries, which in the  postwar  years\r\n\r\nreceived  unprecedented attention among  international\r\n\r\norganisations  such  as  the United  Nations  and  its\r\n\r\nspecialised     agencies,    national     Governments,\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  the  enlightened  public  of   most\r\n\r\ncountries. A vast literature has proliferated  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of the techniques and policies which national\r\n\r\nGovernments should pursue to achieve what is  commonly\r\n\r\ntermed \"the take-off into self-sustaining growth\". Not\r\n\r\nonly  has  there been great interest but recent  years\r\n\r\nwitnessed  an  upsurge  of  confidence  that  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth   is   possible  in  underdeveloped  countries.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  no less august a body than the United Nations\r\n\r\nhas termed the 1960s as the decade of development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken but 3\u00bd years of this decade to bring about\r\n\r\na growing disenchantment about the prospects of this take-off into self-sustaining\r\n\r\neconomic growth.  The countries of Asia have, one after another, experienced not only\r\n\r\na  slowing down of  growth but actual decline.  We have only to look outside  our country\r\n\r\nto see several of our neighbours in dire economic distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for Malaya and Singapore, the first  three\r\n\r\nyears  of  this  decade have been  years  of  promise.\r\n\r\nSubstantial economic expansion has taken place both in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya and in Singapore.  And  the\r\n\r\nreasons  are  not  far to see. We both  possessed  and\r\n\r\nstill  so far have retained all the pre-requisites  of\r\n\r\neconomic growth. We have a strong and stable currency.\r\n\r\nThere is a firm legal framework in which contracts are\r\n\r\nenforceable, thereby making future business  relations\r\n\r\npredictable. There is also an effective administration\r\n\r\nand  a  reasonable  supply of  experienced  managerial\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economy of Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Singapore, however, is unique in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe  large Asian countries have their economies  based\r\n\r\non  the production of food grains, especially rice, an\r\n\r\noccupation  which engages the energy of  nearly  three\r\n\r\nquarters  of  the population. We in Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\nproduce a single grain of rice and our agriculture  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to  intensive  market  gardening  and  highly\r\n\r\ncapitalised poultry farming and pig rearing.  This  is\r\n\r\nan  advantage  to  us because the production  of  food\r\n\r\ngrains generates low per capita income even under  the\r\n\r\nmost favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another peculiarity of Singapore is the complete\r\n\r\nabsence of natural resources, but this factor is  more\r\n\r\nthan  balanced  by our central geographical  position,\r\n\r\nour  excellent  natural harbour and our  talented  and\r\n\r\nenergetic  population.  Because  of  this,  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant  pursuit  in  Singapore  is  trade  and  its\r\n\r\nrelated  occupations,  such as banking,  shipping  and\r\n\r\ntransportation. Singapore's pre-eminence as a  trading\r\n\r\ncentre of South-East Asia Is known to all of us and is\r\n\r\nnot a matter upon which I need elaborate. But this has\r\n\r\nled  to  two  difficulties in bringing about  our  own\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the expansion of trade largely\r\n\r\ndepends on external factors not within our control. If\r\n\r\nour  neighbouring countries decide to introduce import\r\n\r\ncontrols or exchange controls to reduce the volume  of\r\n\r\ntrade  with us, then there is little we can  do  about\r\n\r\nit.  And  even  if this does not happen  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason to expect that trade will grow in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe growth of our population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty arises in the slowness with\r\n\r\nwhich  capital and enterprise can be transferred  from\r\n\r\ntrade  to other sectors of the economy which could  be\r\n\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our trading communities are not short of\r\n\r\nmanagerial skills, such skills are specialised and the\r\n\r\nbusiness  attitudes generated by trade are  dissimilar\r\n\r\nfrom those required in other pursuits. I shall develop\r\n\r\nthis point at some length later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took office in 1959 we were convinced that\r\n\r\nthe  laissez  faire approach in economic matters  that\r\n\r\nwas  characteristic of past administrations could  not\r\n\r\nbe  relied upon to generate economic growth. Some form\r\n\r\nof  positive  State action was required.  But  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary first to assess and define problems  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic growth. From such an appraisal, we should lay\r\n\r\ndown  the strategy for promoting economic growth  and,\r\n\r\non  the basis of such a strategy, we could create  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  financial and economic institutions  needed\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  the  immediate and long-term  policies\r\n\r\ndictated by this strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad approach to these problems had been\r\n\r\nenunciated  in  the  Party's  The  Tasks  Ahead.   The\r\n\r\npolicies  outlined  in  this  document  needed  to  be\r\n\r\nelaborated  in detail and translated into a  programme\r\n\r\nfor  administrative implementation. And this was  done\r\n\r\nsoon after we took office in the Four-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan  of  the  State. This document was presented  and\r\n\r\napproved by the Assembly early in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>State Development Plan</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan sets out in detail the\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects to be carried out in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.  These include the new capital projects  which\r\n\r\nare  to  be  carried  out by the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nStatutory  Authorities of the State,  such  as  Public\r\n\r\nHousing, the Public Utilities, the port, the Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  and the rest of them. It is possible,  however,\r\n\r\nin  going through the Four-Year Plan to get lost in  a\r\n\r\nmorass  of  details and not to see the  wood  for  the\r\n\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may therefore be excused if I now give a brief\r\n\r\nresume  of the underlying strategy to promote economic\r\n\r\ngrowth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  we,  in the special circumstances of Singapore,\r\n\r\nmust employ in our pursuit of prosperity. The approach\r\n\r\nadopted in this Plan is a flexible and empirical  one.\r\n\r\nRecognising that the creation of new jobs is of  over-riding  importance, the Government believes  that  the\r\n\r\nattack must be mounted on a broad front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should maintain and develop the\r\n\r\ntraditional strong-points of the economy, our trading,\r\n\r\nbanking,  shipping and communications  services  which\r\n\r\nhave  sustained  our entrepot trade. It  would  be  an\r\n\r\nerror  to  take  measures harmful to  our  established\r\n\r\neconomic functions in the quest of something  new  and\r\n\r\nuncertain. Not only should we maintain and improve our\r\n\r\nefficiency  as  a  trading  centre,  hut  also   other\r\n\r\nestablished lines, particularly our agriculture  which\r\n\r\nconsists   mainly  of  market  gardening  and   animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry, should also be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While improving the traditional pursuits, we should\r\n\r\nalso  try to seek new lines of expansion. Because  our\r\n\r\nland  space  is  limited and no mineral  resources  of\r\n\r\nvalue exist, only a narrow range of opportunities  are\r\n\r\nopen to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is the fifth largest port in the\r\n\r\nworld,  it  is obvious that employment on board  ships\r\n\r\noffers  promise of expansion, particularly in  respect\r\n\r\nof  ships in the international sea routes. Accordingly\r\n\r\nthe Government instituted special training courses and\r\n\r\nmade  special  arrangements  with  shipping  lines  to\r\n\r\nincrease the enrolment of Singapore citizens  in  sea-going  occupations. Over the last two years. Singapore\r\n\r\nprovided  1,800 new entrants to employment  in  ocean-going ships. The Government intends further to enlarge\r\n\r\nopportunities  for young men to obtain  employment  in\r\n\r\nships  and  will  introduce a  comprehensive  training\r\n\r\nscheme of deck, engine rooms and catering services  to\r\n\r\nbe  conducted  on  a training ship  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nharbour.  Last  year  15 Singapore  citizens  obtained\r\n\r\nforeign   going   and   home  trade   deck   officers'\r\n\r\nqualifications. The Polytechnic is preparing a  steady\r\n\r\nflow of students for these examinations and more local\r\n\r\ncitizens are also qualifying as harbour pilots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another line of activity which promises rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion  is  tourism. The opportunities  offered  by\r\n\r\ntourism were not, at first, fully appreciated by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  fact, in the 1959 election  platform,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  mention of tourism.  A  study  of  the\r\n\r\nsubject  made after we took office reveals that  there\r\n\r\nare  considerable  potentialities  for  expansion   in\r\n\r\ntourism. This industry can add to our national  income\r\n\r\nand   increase  employment  in  the  catering,  hotel,\r\n\r\nentertainment  and  transportation industries  of  the\r\n\r\nState. The Plan to develop tourism is being worked out\r\n\r\nnow and will be put into operation in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrialisation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these activities, our traditional entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  shipping, banking, agriculture, together  with\r\n\r\nthe new lines of employment on board ship and tourism,\r\n\r\ncannot  provide  sufficient outlets  for  our  growing\r\n\r\npopulation even when they are pushed to the limits  of\r\n\r\ntheir  existing potentialities. The one  hope  of  our\r\n\r\nisland  State  lies  in  expanding  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries. And this must be done largely  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of  a  competitive free enterprise  system,\r\n\r\nunless  we  are  prepared to suffer an  immediate  and\r\n\r\nsevere  decline  of  our standards of  living  brought\r\n\r\nabout by high cost of production of goods that we buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of industrialisation is one which has\r\n\r\nbeen  exercising  the mind of the  Government  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes.  It is a matter of over-riding importance,  for\r\n\r\non  the success of its effort to industrialise depends\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of  the State. If we fail,  then  there\r\n\r\nfollows  inevitably mounting unemployment  and  misery\r\n\r\nand  this  will  bring  in its train  mounting  social\r\n\r\ntension  which  will  finally  lead  to  an  explosive\r\n\r\ncatastrophy  of  some kind. This  being  the  case,  I\r\n\r\nintend  to devote some time to an examination of  what\r\n\r\nwe  can  do in Singapore, what we have done  and  what\r\n\r\nstill remains to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First what can Singapore hope to do by way of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation?  A  large   nation   with   a   big\r\n\r\npopulation  and  an  extensive  land  area  with  many\r\n\r\nnatural  resources can afford to experiment with  high\r\n\r\ncost  industries set up under a prohibition of imports\r\n\r\nor  a high tariff wall. Such a country can allow these\r\n\r\nhigh cost industries to survive even if the industries\r\n\r\nare not efficient in the first instance, by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassing   on  the  increased  Cost  to  the  consumer.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  on these lines  can  be  rapid  and\r\n\r\nspectacular  if it is pressed forward with  sufficient\r\n\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, lacks the prerequisites for such\r\n\r\nan  endeavour,  namely,  a  large  population,  varied\r\n\r\nnatural resources and extensive land area. This  being\r\n\r\nthe  case,  our plan of industrial expansion  must  be\r\n\r\nmore  circumspect and judicious. Particularly  as  our\r\n\r\neconomy   still  rests  so  much  on  trade,  enforced\r\n\r\nindustrialisation at the expense of trade  can  be  an\r\n\r\nuncertain gamble with such a small domestic market  as\r\n\r\nwe have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In The Tasks Ahead the essential strategy is\r\n\r\noutlined which is needed to promote industrial growth.\r\n\r\nThree  basic  policies  were recommended;  first,  the\r\n\r\nestablishment   of  an  Economic  Development   Board;\r\n\r\nsecond,  expansion of technical education; third,  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a Malayan Common Market. That  was  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  which we recommended to the  electorate  in\r\n\r\n1959   and   the   policies  recommended   have   been\r\n\r\nimplemented or are at some stage of realisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the policy in 1959. What has been the\r\n\r\nperformance?  As  Members already know,  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board was established towards the  end  of\r\n\r\n1961.  I recollect the many questions that were  asked\r\n\r\nin this [louse in the first two years, which showed  a\r\n\r\nnatural  impatience  over  the  establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard. I had explained that industrial promotion was a\r\n\r\nnovel venture in the State and that the Government had\r\n\r\nto    give   the   most   thorough   preparation   and\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  all aspects of the  subject  before\r\n\r\nembarking upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is now firmly established and work is  in  full\r\n\r\nswing. The Board is staffed by both overseas and local\r\n\r\nexperts.  There are six expert personnel  provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations. They consist of the Director  of\r\n\r\nthe Board, a Chemical Engineer, a Mechanical Engineer,\r\n\r\na  Cost  Accountant, an Industrial Consultant and  the\r\n\r\nChief   of  the  Technical  Consultant  Services.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  short-term  services  of  three  other\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations experts for specific duties have  been\r\n\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnamely, a Naval Architect, an expert on tanneries, and\r\n\r\nan  industrial food consultant. But the main numerical\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the Board comes from local staff.  Local\r\n\r\npersonnel  of  the  Board at  the, expert  level  now\r\n\r\nnumbers  31.  They cover a wide range of  professions.\r\n\r\nMost  of  them belong to some branch or other  of  the\r\n\r\nengineering profession-civil, mechanical, chemical and\r\n\r\nelectrical.   There  are  also  chemists,  economists,\r\n\r\naccountants and architects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Industrial Research Unit was\r\n\r\nestablished only last month. It is staffed by  various\r\n\r\nprofessional experts provided by the Government of New\r\n\r\nZealand with local counterparts under training. So  it\r\n\r\ncan  now be said that the Economic Development  Board,\r\n\r\nin   terms  of  financial  and  technical  competence,\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a  powerful agency to promote  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have been the results so far? We can discuss\r\n\r\nthis  under two aspects. First, that of providing  the\r\n\r\nbasic services needed for industry, such as industrial\r\n\r\nsites  complete  with  roads, railways,  ports,  water\r\n\r\nsupply,  power,  telephones and  other  services.  The\r\n\r\nachievement  of  the Board in this  respect  has  been\r\n\r\nnothing  short of spectacular, as any visitor  to  the\r\n\r\nJurong Industrial complex can testify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than $16.7 million have so far been spent at\r\n\r\nJurong. Hills have been levelled and swamps have  been\r\n\r\nfilled.  An area of 900 acres is immediately available\r\n\r\nfor   occupation  as  factory  sites.  More  than   60\r\n\r\napplications   have  been  received  and   these,   if\r\n\r\napproved, would cover a total area of 340 acres.  More\r\n\r\nthan  11 miles of roads have been laid of which 7 have\r\n\r\nbeen  metalled or will soon be metalled.  The  railway\r\n\r\nline  is due to be laid and construction will commence\r\n\r\nin  a  few  weeks'  time, the  work  of  planning  and\r\n\r\nsurveying having been completed already. Work has also\r\n\r\ncommenced on the construction of 5,000 feet of  wharf.\r\n\r\nThis  is  due  for  completion by  the  end  of  1964.\r\n\r\nTelephone cables have been laid, so have power  lines,\r\n\r\nand water supplies should be ready sometime this year.\r\n\r\nThe other smaller industrial estates, one at Redhill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the other at Tanglin Halt, are in an advanced\r\n\r\nstage  of  completion. Redhill Estate is fully  booked\r\n\r\nand  25  factories have been completed or are due  for\r\n\r\ncompletion  soon.  The 43 acres at  the  Tanglin  Halt\r\n\r\nindustrial  estate have been almost completely  booked\r\n\r\nand  new  industries  are  starting  up  there  at   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory pace. The industries at these  two  small\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates  cover  a  wide  range  of   light\r\n\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four Pioneer certificates have been granted\r\n\r\nand  19  firms are in operation or will soon  commence\r\n\r\noperation.   The   new   pioneer  industries   already\r\n\r\nestablished  represent a total capital  investment  of\r\n\r\n$130 million and are providing permanent jobs for more\r\n\r\nthan  3,500  people.  Another 13 pioneer  certificates\r\n\r\nwill  be awarded shortly. The companies concerned will\r\n\r\nhave  a  subscribed capital of $14.3 million and  will\r\n\r\nprovide jobs for 1,150 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the production of a wide range of\r\n\r\nmanufactures  has  been  under  investigation  by  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board for some time.  Since  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  in  1962,  there has  been  a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  interest, both locally and overseas,  in\r\n\r\nestablishing  industries in Singapore. The  industries\r\n\r\non which a decision to establish can be expected to be\r\n\r\nmade  this  year include a wide range of  manufactures\r\n\r\nsuch  as  bitumen,  fertilisers, ceramic  wall  tiles,\r\n\r\nceramic sanitary ware, calcium carbide, caustic  soda,\r\n\r\nchlorine,   car   batteries, ammonia   and   ammcnium\r\n\r\nsulphate, plastic products, leather, ground phosphate,\r\n\r\nelectric  light  bulbs, insulated  cables,  pipes  and\r\n\r\ngalvanised  iron  sheets and various  items  of  food-processing. This new range of industries, if and  when\r\n\r\nthey  start off, will involve a capital investment  of\r\n\r\n$56  million  and  will provide employment  for  1,620\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of the industries I have mentioned\r\n\r\nabove  represents the direct result of the promotional\r\n\r\neffort  of  the Economic Development Board.  All  this\r\n\r\npromotional  work was undertaken against a  relatively\r\n\r\nunfavourable   background  of  political   strife   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and politically inspired labour troubles. It\r\n\r\nshould  also  be remembered that these new  industries\r\n\r\nare being set up without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  tariff  protection  which  most  other  countries\r\n\r\nconsider  essential.  I have no doubt  that  with  the\r\n\r\ntariff  protection  accorded by a  Common  Market,  we\r\n\r\nshall see a rapid acceleration of industrialisation in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I shall deal with this subject later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the second approach advocated in The\r\n\r\nTasks   Ahead - the   development  of   scientific   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  skills  at  all  levels.  Modem  industries\r\n\r\nrequire  men trained in a wide range of skills.  At  a\r\n\r\nprofessional level, we have the Singapore  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand   the   Science  Faculty  of  the  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For  courses not  provided  at  these  two\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  the  Government has  made  arrangements\r\n\r\nwith   various  Colombo  Plan  countries  to   provide\r\n\r\nincreasing  numbers  of  places  for  scientific   and\r\n\r\ntechnical education. In fact, today there are no  less\r\n\r\nthan  139 scholars abroad engaged in undergraduate  or\r\n\r\npostgraduate  studies in various branches  of  science\r\n\r\nand engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford to neglect the training of\r\n\r\npersonnel  at  the  lower  level  of  technicians  and\r\n\r\ncraftsmen.  The,  Ministry of Education  has  examined\r\n\r\nthis  aspect with some thoroughness. A plan is now  in\r\n\r\nhand to expand technical education to provide industry\r\n\r\nwith   an   increasing  supply  of   technicians   and\r\n\r\ncraftsmen. There is now a Vocational Institute with an\r\n\r\nenrolment  of nearly 1,000. There are in addition  two\r\n\r\nsecondary technical schools with an enrolment of 2,500\r\n\r\npupils.  Next  year, no less than four  new  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  will  be  ready  to  admit  a  total  maximum\r\n\r\nenrolment  of  7,680 pupils in two sessions'.  And  in 1965  an  additional  three new  vocational  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  will  be  established to provide  places  for 5,760 pupils in two sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Common Market</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third policy is to establish a common market.\r\n\r\nOur  election programme in 1959 declared that a common\r\n\r\nmarket   with  the  Federation  of  Malaya  would   be\r\n\r\nessential  to fast economic industrial growth  in  the\r\n\r\ntwo territories. Members are aware of the efforts made\r\n\r\nby the Singapore Government to obtain the agreement of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government to establish a common mar-ket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, progress had not been as fast  as  we\r\n\r\nwould have desired, but nevertheless definite advances\r\n\r\nwere made towards this goal. The breakthrough occurred\r\n\r\nin  February this year when a World Bank Mission under\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of Professor Jacques Rueff came to the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya,  Singapore  and  the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories,  for  a  study of the  subject.  The  two\r\n\r\nGovernments  have  received the report  of  the  Rueff\r\n\r\nMission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not at liberty to disclose recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the Rueff Mission nor do I wish to anticipate  the\r\n\r\nfuture  course of negotiations which will  take  place\r\n\r\nbetween the Governments of Singapore and Malaya. But I\r\n\r\nhave  no hesitation in saying that the Report of  this\r\n\r\nMission will prove to be of profound importance to the\r\n\r\nfuture of Malaysia and will find an authentic place in\r\n\r\nthe annals oil the economic history of this territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish here to give a broad outline of how the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore would be affected by  a  common\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain, without going into intricate\r\n\r\ntechnical   details,  the  basic  issues   which   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of any form of common market will  bring\r\n\r\nabout,  given  the  existing tariff systems,  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  economic  structures  of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. As I have stated  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  previous  occasions,  there  would  be   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty whatsoever in getting agreement on a common\r\n\r\nmarket  with  the  Federation of  Malaya  if  we  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to join them in a full-scale customs  union.\r\n\r\nThis  means  that  we  shall  have  to  introduce   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the same tariff scales as in the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya. The trouble about this proposal  is  that,\r\n\r\nwhile  it  will  give a decided impetus to  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth, it will also dislocate the entrepot trade to a\r\n\r\ndangerous   extent.  A  complete  customs   union   is\r\n\r\ntherefore not a feasible proposition for Singapore  at\r\n\r\nthe present juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore proposed a limited form of common\r\n\r\nmarket  whereby goods manufactured in the  territories\r\n\r\nof   Malaysia   will  be  subject  to  common   market\r\n\r\ntreatment.  That is to say, there would be  protective\r\n\r\nduties  imposed on these goods when imported into  any\r\n\r\npart of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia  while  local manufactures  can  move  freely\r\n\r\nwithin  the  area  without duty. On  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\ntariffs  on  goods which are not now manufactured  and\r\n\r\nare  not  likely to be manufactured in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nterritories would not apply to Singapore.  This  would\r\n\r\nreduce  the degree of dislocation that would be caused\r\n\r\nto the entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the limited form of common market which we\r\n\r\nconsider  practical in the present circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nrange  of imported manufactures which will be  subject\r\n\r\nto  import duties will be extensive. This is likely to\r\n\r\nincrease  in  time when manufactures of an  increasing\r\n\r\nrange of goods previously imported will be possible in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the common market affect trade and\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore? The first point to be noted  is\r\n\r\nthat  protective tariffs in Singapore will apply  only\r\n\r\nto  manufactures  and  not to tropical  raw  materials\r\n\r\nwhich form the greater bulk of our entrepot trade.  So\r\n\r\nthe  traditional  entrepot trade  in,  rubber,  copra,\r\n\r\ncoffee,  sago, spices, jungle produce and other  goods\r\n\r\nwill not in any way be affected by the common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, even where import duties are placed on\r\n\r\nimported goads, every facility will he given to the re-export trade. An elaborate system of bonded warehouses\r\n\r\nwith adequate facilities for handling and packaging of\r\n\r\ngoods  will  be  set up as part of the  common  market\r\n\r\narrangements. The bonded warehouses will enable  these\r\n\r\ngoods  to be re-exported without duty and in this  way\r\n\r\nwill  help to sustain the competitive position of  our\r\n\r\nre-exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all that we can do to safeguard our re-export trade, it is necessary that traders engaged in\r\n\r\nthe entrepot trade in manufactures should undertake  a\r\n\r\nbasic  re-appraisal of their future prospects. I  must\r\n\r\nmake it clear that the lamest sng1e market for our re-exports  of  manufactured goods is the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It  is likely that, under the common  market,\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in the Federation of  Malaya  itself\r\n\r\nwill gain an added momentum and it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  that many of the goods which she now  imports\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore will be produced in the  Federation\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not open for the traders to say that\r\n\r\nif  Singapore keeps out of the common market then they\r\n\r\ncan  hope  to  retain  their re-export  trade  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  If  Singapore keeps  out  of  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket, then the Federation would industrialise by her\r\n\r\nown  efforts and produce many of her goods  which  she\r\n\r\nnow imports through Singapore. In this event, we would\r\n\r\nlose our re-export trade to the Federation without any\r\n\r\ncompensating advantage in the way of local  industries\r\n\r\nto produce these goods in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My advice to importers and traders now engaged in\r\n\r\nthese  lines  is  to take a more serious  interest  in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  than they hitherto  have  done.  If\r\n\r\nthey  divert  their  energies and business  talent  in\r\n\r\ngradual  stages from trade to industry, then there  is\r\n\r\nno  reason  why  their  present prosperity  cannot  be\r\n\r\nmaintained in the future. The profits which  they  now\r\n\r\nmake in trade in imported manufactured goods will come\r\n\r\nin  a different form in the shape of profits in making\r\n\r\nthese  goods themselves. This will happen  if  traders\r\n\r\nare  sufficiently  alert and  aware  of  the  changing\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Malaysia.  The Government,  `through  the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board,  will   do   everything\r\n\r\npossible to enable traders to move into industries  in\r\n\r\nthe line of products they have experience in handling.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, if these traders refuse to accept\r\n\r\nthe new challenge and grasp the new opportunities that\r\n\r\narc  offered, then they only have themselves to  blame\r\n\r\nif  the  diminution of their re-export  trade  is  not\r\n\r\nmatched by an accretion of income from new sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common market is the last of the three-point\r\n\r\nprogramme  of industrialisation which we announced  we\r\n\r\nwould  carry  out in 1959. This has been  the  missing\r\n\r\nlink  of  Singapore's drive towards industrialisation.\r\n\r\nIt  is  by  far  the  most decisive single  factor  in\r\n\r\naccelerating industrial growth. For nearly four  years\r\n\r\nwe  have  strained  every resource  and  ingenuity  to\r\n\r\nachieve  it, but this objective has until  now  eluded\r\n\r\nour   grasp.  Now  at  last  the  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  has announced that it accepts in principle\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a common market in Malaysia.  It\r\n\r\nonly remains for the terms of this common market to be\r\n\r\nworked out and agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the common market in Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill    provide    a    greater   impetus    to    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation effort than anything else can do. It\r\n\r\nwill, in addition, also quicken the pace of industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth  in other parts of Malaysia. If we conduct  our\r\n\r\naffairs with intelligence, energy and resourcefulness,\r\n\r\nthere  is every reason to hope that Malaysia will,  in\r\n\r\nthe  1960s, fully live up to the expectation that this\r\n\r\nwill be a decade of development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore it means that we would have found at\r\n\r\nlast a solution to our problem of unemployment. If all\r\n\r\ngoes  well, the thousands of young men and  women  who\r\n\r\nwould  be  looking for decent and secure jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nyears  to  come will find the jobs available.  And  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  prepared to go through the many courses  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  training which will be  made  available  to\r\n\r\nthem,  then  they will not only secure for  themselves\r\n\r\nbetter  jobs  in  industry  but  they  will  also   be\r\n\r\nproviding  our growing industries with a  much  needed\r\n\r\nsupply of skilled labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>1962 Economic Review</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to a general review of economic\r\n\r\nactivity  in 1962. By all accounts, 1962  was  a  good\r\n\r\nyear  for Singapore, even better than 1961. There were\r\n\r\nmarked advances in most fields of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are a trading centre, a review of economic\r\n\r\nactivities should properly begin with trade, in  1962\r\n\r\nour  total imports came to $4,036 million as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  $3,964  million  in 1961.  Exports  amounted  to $3,419  million  as  compared with $3,308  million  in 1961.  There  was therefore a small though significant\r\n\r\nincrease so far as the value of our external trade  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But  it  should be  remembered  that  1962\r\n\r\nprices  of  major commodities were considerably  lower\r\n\r\nthan  those  obtaining  in  1961.  For  instance,  the\r\n\r\naverage  price  of rubber in 1962 came  to  only  78.2\r\n\r\ncents per pound as compared with 83.8 cents the previous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear. There were also substantial falls in  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  practically every item entering  into  our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade, particularly products such as  coconut\r\n\r\noil, pepper and coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in prices conceals the real expansion\r\n\r\nin  the physical volume of trade conducted through our\r\n\r\nport.  For  Singapore, it is the  physical  volume  of\r\n\r\ntrade that really matters, for we draw our income from\r\n\r\nhandling, processing and packaging of goods through  a\r\n\r\nnumber of stages, and the larger the volume, the  more\r\n\r\nwork and income are generated. In physical terms,  the\r\n\r\namount  of cargo loaded in Singapore was 7.66  million\r\n\r\ntons  in 1962 compared with 6.51 million tons in 1961.\r\n\r\nThis  represented an increase of 18 per cent of  cargo\r\n\r\nloaded in our port, both at the Harbour Board wharves,\r\n\r\nin  the roads and at our oil terminals. The volume  of\r\n\r\ncargo  discharged in 1962 was 13.40  million  tons  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  11.75  million  tons  in  1961.  `This\r\n\r\nincrease comes to some 14 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quite the most spectacular expansion of our\r\n\r\neconomy occurred in the construction industry. In 1962\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and  Development Board completed  12,230\r\n\r\nhouses  as  against 7,320 in 1961. Exact  figures  for\r\n\r\nprivate housing are not available, but visual evidence\r\n\r\nof  private  construction now in progress at  so  many\r\n\r\nplaces  in  our  island suggests  that  a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  did  take place in 1962. The  statistics  on\r\n\r\nbuilding materials bear this out. The output of bricks\r\n\r\nshowed  an increase of 51 per cent in 1962 as compared\r\n\r\nwith  1961.  Retained imports of  cement  amounted  to\r\n\r\n260,000 tons in 1962, representing an increase  of  39\r\n\r\nper  cent  over  the  1961  figure  of  186,000  tons.\r\n\r\nRetained  imports  of  structural  steel  amounted  to\r\n\r\n45,000 tons in 1962, showing a percentage increase  of\r\n\r\n36.8 per cent over the 1961 imports of 32,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour statistics on the number of workers employed\r\n\r\nin  the  building  industry also  show  a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  between  1961 and 1962.  There  were  10,372\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the building industry in  March  1961  as\r\n\r\ncompared with 13,033 in September 1962, an increase of\r\n\r\n26 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent.  The  actual  increase was probably  larger,  as\r\n\r\nstatistics on the activities of small contractors  and\r\n\r\nsub-contractors in the building trade are  notoriously\r\n\r\ndifficult to collect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the general level of economic\r\n\r\nactivity  is  reflected in the statistics on  finance.\r\n\r\nLoans and advances by banks in Singapore over the year\r\n\r\ncame to $706.7 million as compared with $625.5 million\r\n\r\nthe previous year. There was a substantial increase in\r\n\r\nbank  deposits from $880.9 million in 1961  to  $983.9\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1962.  This  increase  in  bank  deposits\r\n\r\noccurred  in  all  categories,  for  example,  current\r\n\r\naccounts,  time,  as  well as  savings  deposits.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  in  time  deposits was particularly  marked,\r\n\r\nbeing of the order of some $80 million. This expansion\r\n\r\nin  private  commercial  banking  is  matched  by  the\r\n\r\nperformance in public finance. I shall deal with  this\r\n\r\naspect when I come to the 1962 expenditure and revenue\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that with heightened economic\r\n\r\nactivity, people will be better off and would buy more\r\n\r\ngoods.  Here  again  the  statistics  show  that   the\r\n\r\nconsumer  in Singapore did well in 1962. He  bought  8\r\n\r\nper  cent  more motor-cars than in 1961, spent  6  per\r\n\r\ncent more on refrigerators, 8 per cent more on radios,\r\n\r\n27  per  cent more on cameras, drank 7 per  cent  more\r\n\r\nliquors, used more petrol, went to cinemas more often,\r\n\r\nwore  more  and  better clothes, and generally  had  a\r\n\r\nbetter  time than in 1961. But we are still  far  from\r\n\r\nbeing  an affluent society. It is our business to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the affluence which is now enjoyed by a  limited\r\n\r\nsection  of our society is extended to everyone.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  a  matter-if I may be permitted a metaphor-of\r\n\r\nsharing  our existing cake in equal slices  all  round\r\n\r\nbut  of  producing a bigger cake so that everyone  can\r\n\r\nhave   a  larger  slice.  In  other  words,  it  means\r\n\r\nproducing  a  larger  national  income  through   fast\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure in 1962</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to a review of revenue and\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  1962. From my brief  account  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast year, it would hardly come as a surprise  to\r\n\r\nMembers  if  I were to say that the financial  outcome\r\n\r\nfor  that  year  was not unsatisfactory.  The  revenue\r\n\r\ncollected  amounted to $418.8 millions and  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure was $351.7 millions. With the transfer  of\r\n\r\n$30  millions from current revenue to the  Development\r\n\r\nFund,  this  means that the total surplus  on  current\r\n\r\naccount  in  1962 was $97.1 millions. Ordinarily  this\r\n\r\nmight    have   been   a   subject   for   unqualified\r\n\r\nsatisfaction,  but,  however,  recently   our   annual\r\n\r\nfinancial   surpluses  have   been   the   object   of\r\n\r\nembarrassing attention in certain quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, 1962 was a good year financially and\r\n\r\nthe reserves both in the Consolidated Fund Account and\r\n\r\nthe  Development Fund Account were strengthened by the\r\n\r\nend  of  1962, when they stood at $208.8 millions  and $141.6   millions  respectively.  This  was  a   great\r\n\r\nimprovement on the $87.2 millions we started  with  in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will be pleased that this\r\n\r\nstrong  position had been achieved in  spite  of  very\r\n\r\nheavy expenditure incurred in providing the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with increasing numbers of houses,  schools,\r\n\r\nroads, standpipes, lighting, community centres and, of\r\n\r\ncourse, the massive Jurong industrial complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the Government was reflected in the\r\n\r\nsupport   for   the  $60  million  loan  raised   last\r\n\r\nSeptember.   The  World  Bank  undertook  a   detailed\r\n\r\nfinancial  and  economic  review  of  the  State   and\r\n\r\nendorsed  the  sound financial standing  and  economic\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government.  On  the  basis  of  this\r\n\r\nfavourable  report  on  the credit-worthiness  of  the\r\n\r\nState of Singapore, the World Bank agreed to a loan of $45  million  for  the  extension  of  electric  power\r\n\r\nsupply.  The loan agreement has since been  signed  in\r\n\r\nWashington  on  the 16th May, 1963. I  should  mention\r\n\r\nhere  that construction work at the new Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nPower  Station had not in any way been delayed at  any\r\n\r\nstage  because,  while  the  loan  negotiations   were\r\n\r\nproceeding,  tenders for Construction of  the  Station\r\n\r\nand the supply of equipment were proceeded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  simultaneously. Members are also aware  that  an\r\n\r\napplication has been made to the World Bank to finance\r\n\r\nthe Johore River project to ensure that there will not\r\n\r\nbe  any  shortage of water in the foreseeable  future.\r\n\r\nThe  World Bank loan for the power project carries  an\r\n\r\ninterest of 5\u00ab per cent a year and is repayable over a\r\n\r\nperiod   of   20  years.  These  terms  are  eminently\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to delve in too great a detail\r\n\r\ninto  the  revenue and expenditure account  for  1962.\r\n\r\nRevenue exceeded the estimates by $26.5 millions while\r\n\r\na  shortfall  of  $47.8 millions  was  experienced  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This shortfall in expenditure  has  been\r\n\r\nrecurring  for  some years and in my  previous  Budget\r\n\r\nspeeches  I  have  explained the  main  reasons  which\r\n\r\nbrought  about  these savings. Some of  these  reasons\r\n\r\nstill  held good in 1962, but there were a  number  of\r\n\r\nother  factors which cropped up during the  course  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  including certain economy  measures  which\r\n\r\nwere introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estimates Committee of the Assembly has examined\r\n\r\ncertain  cases  of over-estimation of expenditure  and\r\n\r\nthe   recommendations  of  the  Committee  have   been\r\n\r\naccepted by the Government. It would be impossible  to\r\n\r\nguarantee that there will be no further shortfalls  in\r\n\r\nfuture   estimates   of  expenditure.   So   long   as\r\n\r\ndepartments are expanding and so long as the  services\r\n\r\nprovided  to  the  public are being  expanded,  it  is\r\n\r\nvirtually  impossible to avoid shortfalls,  especially\r\n\r\nin  personal emoluments. In most instances,  provision\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  made for staff for the full year  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates,  whereas in practice, time is  required  to\r\n\r\nrecruit staff. This means that the full complement  of\r\n\r\nstaff  will not be available as from the first day  of\r\n\r\nthe  year but sometime during the year with consequent\r\n\r\nsavings in expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I might mention the big items of under-expenditure in the various Ministries. There was a\r\n\r\nshortfall  of $4 millions in the Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment of which $3.4 millions was in  respect  of\r\n\r\nO.C.S.E. items   and   $\u00bd million   under   Personal\r\n\r\nEmoluments. The main reason was that the Work  Brigade\r\n\r\ndid not expand to the full extent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  provided  for. This was principally  due  to\r\n\r\nbetter economic conditions which resulted in a smaller\r\n\r\nnumber  of  applicants joining the Work  Brigade.  The\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department experienced a  shortfall  of $1.6  millions, nearly all of which was in respect  of\r\n\r\nPersonal Emoluments. There was a saving of $3 millions\r\n\r\nunder  Public Works Recurrent, a smaller  figure  than\r\n\r\npreviously  experienced. The Ministry of Health  spent $5  millions below their estimates, of which half  was\r\n\r\ndue to savings in personal emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure for pensions, retirement allowances\r\n\r\nand  gratuities saw a shortfall of $9.1 millions,  and\r\n\r\nthis was principally due to faulty estimation. One  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons was that the amounts that had to  be  set\r\n\r\naside in the past for Malayanisation compensation  had\r\n\r\nnot been sufficiently reduced. The Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nunderspent by $2.2 millions, and most of this was  due\r\n\r\nto over-provision for the television services. A large\r\n\r\nstaff of technicians, programme assistants, cameramen,\r\n\r\nstudio   floor  managers,  costume  designers,  script\r\n\r\nwriters  and other grades had to be engaged to  run  a\r\n\r\ntelevision service, and by the end of the year, it was\r\n\r\nnot  possible  to engage more than a fraction  of  the\r\n\r\nfull  complement.  Since  then,  however,  substantial\r\n\r\nprogress has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defence Services underspent by $1.4 millions and\r\n\r\nthis  was due to the slowness in recruiting the Second\r\n\r\nBattalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment.  Finally\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education underspent by $7.5 millions,\r\n\r\nmost of which was in respect of personal emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the yield of revenue which, as I said,\r\n\r\nhad  exceeded  the  estimates by $26.5  millions.  The\r\n\r\nadditional revenue resulted from the buoyant  economic\r\n\r\nconditions which existed during the year, particularly\r\n\r\nafter  the  Referendum. The Inland Revenue  Department\r\n\r\nhad  a  good  year, income tax exceeding estimates  by\r\n\r\n$8.5  millions,  while property tax,  stamp  duty  and\r\n\r\nestate  duty taken together yielded some $1.8 millions\r\n\r\nin  excess  of  the estimates. The Customs  Department\r\n\r\nalso exceeded their estimates. The excess was $5.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillions  and  was  distributed more  or  less  evenly\r\n\r\nbetween   petroleum,   liquor  and   tobacco   duties.\r\n\r\nEntertainment  duty  showed a modest  half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars excess over the estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the yield of property tax by $0.4\r\n\r\nmillion  was  particularly noteworthy in view  of  the\r\n\r\nconcessions  that  were made to  owner-occupied  attap\r\n\r\nhouses. Until the granting of tax concessions to these\r\n\r\npersons,  the  rate  of  tax on  owner-occupied  attap\r\n\r\nhouses  in  the  city  areas  was  36  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  felt that these properties did  not  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe same benefits by way of roads, lighting, water and\r\n\r\nelectric  supply as compared with permanent dwellings.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on grounds of equity, it was  decided  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the rates of tax from 36 per cent  to  27  per\r\n\r\ncent.  The  Government has also decided to follow  the\r\n\r\nFederation  policy in respect of exemption  of  income\r\n\r\ntax  from all owner-occupied houses. We have, however,\r\n\r\nimposed a limit of $3,000 net annual value by  way  of\r\n\r\ntax exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that when the Property Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance   was  passed  by  the  Assembly,   it   was\r\n\r\nspecifically provided that property tax should be paid\r\n\r\non  unoccupied buildings. The reason for this measure,\r\n\r\nas  I  then  explained to the House,  was  that  under\r\n\r\nconditions  of acute housing shortage, which  we  then\r\n\r\nexperienced,  there  was  no  valid  reason  for   any\r\n\r\ndwelling to remain unoccupied for any length of  time.\r\n\r\nWe  also  know that sonic property owners are  holding\r\n\r\nout  at  high  rents to take advantage of the  housing\r\n\r\nshortage, and hold the prospective tenants to  ransom.\r\n\r\nObviously  exemption  from tax during  the  period  of\r\n\r\nvacancy  of his properties would encourage him  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  I  promised the Assembly that when the  housing\r\n\r\nsituation  improved, I would make a review.  With  the\r\n\r\nunprecedented boom in both public and private  housing\r\n\r\nconstruction  now in progress, the time  has  come  to\r\n\r\nmake  this review. Accordingly, I have authorised  the\r\n\r\nInland Revenue Department to exempt from Property  Tax\r\n\r\nall  unoccupied buildings as from the 1st January this\r\n\r\nyear, subject to certain conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue and Expenditure 1963</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the revenue and expenditure for 1963.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  asked for a vote on account in 1961  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  six months of expenditure for 1963, I then  had\r\n\r\nin  mind the possibility of agreement on the financial\r\n\r\nterms  of  merger which will enable the Estimates  for\r\n\r\n1963  to  take into account the changing circumstances\r\n\r\nfollowing the setting up of Malaysia. As Members know,\r\n\r\nfinal  agreement  around the  corner  has  yet  to  be\r\n\r\nreached.  Accordingly, the Budget for  1963  had  been\r\n\r\nprepared on the basis of maintaining existing services\r\n\r\nwherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keynote has been that of maintaining the\r\n\r\nservices  as they are. But, however, there are  a  few\r\n\r\ncases  where  it  is  necessary to  implement  certain\r\n\r\nproposals    immediately   which   would    facilitate\r\n\r\namalgamation  after  Malaysia.  For  instance,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  establish the Second Battalion  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Infantry Regiment now rather than  to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  merger.  There  are  also  certain  consequential\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the Defence services  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nPolice   Force.  As  regards  other  Ministries,   the\r\n\r\nexpansion  on  education expenditure, which  has  been\r\n\r\nparticularly rapid since this Government took  office,\r\n\r\ncontinues. We have now reached a stage when  there  is\r\n\r\nde  facto  free  primary education  for  all  children\r\n\r\nbetween  the  years  of 6 and 14. If  we  compare  our\r\n\r\nachievements  in education with those of other  States\r\n\r\nin   Asia,   we  shall  have  cause  for   pride   and\r\n\r\nsatisfaction. At the same time, we must not forget how\r\n\r\nmuch  we  owe  to the dedicated corps of teachers  and\r\n\r\nschool  principals whose hands will mould  the  future\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  Malaysians. This year  $94.7  millions\r\n\r\nhave  been  provided for the Ministry of Education  as\r\n\r\nagainst $89.1 millions last year. The increases  cover\r\n\r\nstaff  for the new schools, increases in bursaries  to\r\n\r\nthe  Universities of Singapore and Nanyang,  and  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn College and the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will recollect that  in  1960  I  drew\r\n\r\nattention  to the burgeoning expenditure on education.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the result both of the population explosion\r\n\r\nas   well  as  our  policy  to  achieve  free  primary\r\n\r\neducation. Members will learn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  some  relief  that there has  been  a  sustained\r\n\r\ndecline  in  the birth rate over the last five  years.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of births appears to have been stabilised\r\n\r\nat  between  59,000 and 60,000 a year, and  this  will\r\n\r\nafford  some relief in future years on the  increasing\r\n\r\nsums  that have to be spent on primary education.  But\r\n\r\nthe  task  of  building  more  secondary  schools  and\r\n\r\nexpanding    higher    technical,    vocational    and\r\n\r\nprofessional education will remain with  us  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  and  threaten to make severe inroads  into  our\r\n\r\nfinances in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of new services have been introduced and\r\n\r\nfinancial provisions have been made for them  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  estimates. In Head 29 (Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt),  a  provision of $348,010  has  been  made  as\r\n\r\nagainst last year's provision of $171,300. This is  to\r\n\r\npay  for  the  cost of a second Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt, which is necessary because of congestion in the\r\n\r\nfirst  Court. The television services introduced  last\r\n\r\nFebruary  call for an increase of $3.3 millions  under\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture. In the Ministry of  Finance,\r\n\r\nHead  33, there is an increase of $6.8 millions  which\r\n\r\nis  due  to  a  new item under Other Charges  Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent,  namely,  a  subsidy  to  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new departure from previous policy and I\r\n\r\nwish to comment on it at some length. It has been  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  previous  administrations  to  give  the\r\n\r\nhousing  authority,  then  the  Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust,  a concealed subsidy by way of favourable  loan\r\n\r\nconditions. Loans extended to the housing authority in\r\n\r\nthe  past  were repayable in 60 years,  and  this,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  reduced  the annual cost of  amortization  on\r\n\r\npublic  housing.  In addition to this,  low  rates  of\r\n\r\ninterest were charged, sometimes as low as 2\u00bd per cent\r\n\r\nper year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of this Government that subsidies to\r\n\r\npublic  housing should not be disguised  or  concealed\r\n\r\nand   that  the  full  amount  should  appear  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  estimates. The loans now  extended  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  are  made  on  terms\r\n\r\napproximating as closely as possible to  the  existing\r\n\r\nmarket rates. As against this, a subsidy is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  Board which represents the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the open market loan terms and the subsidised\r\n\r\nloan  terms.  I should mention here that a substantial\r\n\r\nsubsidy  arose  from the uneconomic  rents  which  the\r\n\r\nprevious  administration  had  fixed  during   1958/59\r\n\r\nshortly before the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of the subsidy and the details of the\r\n\r\ncomputations   of  sums  involved  have   been   under\r\n\r\nnegotiation  for more than a year between the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard and the Ministry of Finance. The details will be\r\n\r\nannounced when final agreement has been reached on all\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the House to certain\r\n\r\nsubstantial decreases in expenditure. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, Head 20, shows  a  decrease  of $1.4   millions.   Head   35,   Pensions,   Retirement\r\n\r\nAllowances  and Gratuities have been reduced  by  $7.1\r\n\r\nmillions and Public Works recurrent by $1.5 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to revenue, I expect the favourable\r\n\r\nconditions of last year to continue. Accordingly,  the\r\n\r\nestimated yield of the main items of revenue has  been\r\n\r\nincreased.  There is an increase of $4  millions  over\r\n\r\nlast  year's  estimates of income tax,  and  increases\r\n\r\nhave  also  been  allowed for in  respect  of  customs\r\n\r\nduties.  The  total  yield of  liquor,  petroleum  and\r\n\r\ntobacco duties is expected to be $6.5 millions  larger\r\n\r\nthan  last year's estimates. Increases have also  been\r\n\r\nallowed for in respect of stamp duties, estate  duties\r\n\r\nand   entertainment  duties.  Telecommunications   and\r\n\r\npostal  services are expected to show an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$2.1  millions. The estimate for Registration Fees  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  motor  vehicles  has  been  substantially\r\n\r\nincreased by $3.5 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the total revenue expected to be received\r\n\r\nfor 1963 had been set at $409.7 millions as against an\r\n\r\nestimated expenditure of $411.7 millions. The accounts\r\n\r\ntherefore just about balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Administrative Reforms</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is only proper that I should\r\n\r\nconclude  this  report of the administration  with  an\r\n\r\naccount  of two basic reforms which we have completed.\r\n\r\nThe first is the integration of City Council\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartments into the Government Service, and  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  the rest -  members of the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\ntrading departments of the City Council - to the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board.  As  Members know,  the  first  step\r\n\r\ntowards  this integration was undertaken in 1960  when\r\n\r\ntwo  Bills were approved by the Assembly, namely,  the\r\n\r\nProperty Tax Ordinance, 1960, (No. 2 of 1960) and  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government  (Financial Integration)  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1960,  (No.  64  of 1960). Both these Ordinances  took\r\n\r\neffect  as from 1st January, 1961. Together  with  the\r\n\r\nLocal   Government   Integration  and   the   Pensions\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bills  now before the  Assembly  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Ordinance, which was passed  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  earlier this year, the legal  framework  for\r\n\r\nthe integration exercise is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board was established last\r\n\r\nmonth.  All  the assets and liabilities  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  connected with its water, gas and electricity\r\n\r\nundertaking  have  been  transferred  to  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board. These assets include those  portions\r\n\r\nof the City Council common user property hitherto used\r\n\r\nfor the utilities departments, such as portions of the\r\n\r\nTreasurer's  Office, Transport Centre and  City  Hall.\r\n\r\nPublic street lighting and public standpipes, however,\r\n\r\nhave   been  transferred  to  the  ownership  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The assets and liabilities connected  with\r\n\r\npublic loans of the City Council and the sinking funds\r\n\r\nfor  these  loans have been transferred to the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board, with the Government contributing  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board for the portions of outstanding loans which\r\n\r\nwere  used  for purposes unconnected with the  trading\r\n\r\nactivities of the former City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a major administrative exercise of\r\n\r\nconsiderable scope and complexity. The number of staff\r\n\r\ninvolved  is  13,420. Of this, some  8,370  have  been\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Government and the balance 5,050 to\r\n\r\nthe Public Utilities Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unexpected that numerous problems of\r\n\r\nestablishment,  pay,  service conditions  and  related\r\n\r\nmatters follow from the integration exercise. There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been prolonged and numerous negotiations between\r\n\r\nthe  unions affected and the Government. Matters still\r\n\r\noutstanding have been referred to a Board  of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nset up by the Minister for Labour under section 70  of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Relations Ordinance.  This  Board  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  deals with the salary structure  and  service\r\n\r\nconditions  of  monthly-rated employees  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  on  their  transfer to  the  service  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or the Public Utilities Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outstanding matters involving the daily-rated staff\r\n\r\nof the City Council have been referred to a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry under the chairmanship of the Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor   Labour.   These  protracted   negotiations   and\r\n\r\nreference  to  a Board of Inquiry and a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry consume much valuable time and energy of  both\r\n\r\nthe  staff  of  the  Government and officials  of  the\r\n\r\nunions.  But  they  are  an  essential  part  of   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process  whereby an  acceptable  and  fair\r\n\r\nsettlement  of disputes between employer and  employee\r\n\r\ncan be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reform of importance which was carried\r\n\r\nout  during  last  year  concerns  the  acceptance  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with our election pledge of the  principle\r\n\r\nof equal pay and equal treatment for women officers in\r\n\r\nthe Civil Service. Equality for women took effect from\r\n\r\n1st   March,  1962,  and  some  4,500  women  officers\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  this  reform  in  several  ways.  The\r\n\r\nequalization  of salary scales is one  obvious  method\r\n\r\nwhereby previous discrimination against women officers\r\n\r\nhas  been  abolished. Secondly, married women officers\r\n\r\nwho  had been debarred from appointment on a permanent\r\n\r\nand  pensionable  basis on account  of  marriage,  now\r\n\r\nstand   to   benefit   from  the   removal   of   such\r\n\r\ndisqualification.  They thus  stand  to  gain  greater\r\n\r\nsecurity  in  tenure  of office and  better  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects  and, of course, better retirement  benefits\r\n\r\nby   way   of   pension   rights.   Other   forms   of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against women officers, such  as  lower\r\n\r\nage   retirement,  downgrading  of  women  clerks   on\r\n\r\nmarriage   to   assistant  clerks  and  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst women officers in the highest echelon  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil   Service  were  abolished.  Before  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment came to office, the administrative  service\r\n\r\nwas the preserve of men. Since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  seven women officers have been appointed to  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service aid, in fact, in  last  year's\r\n\r\nrecruiting   exercise  the  majority   of   successful\r\n\r\ncandidates  were women. We have accorded  women  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment and we look forward with confidence to equal\r\n\r\nperformance by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>After Malaysia</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier in my speech I told hon. Members that I\r\n\r\nwould   say  something  about  probable  trends  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  deal  first with Singapore.  So  far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  is concerned, the most important  objective\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that the economic expansion of the  last 18  months  or so should not be allowed  to  lose  its\r\n\r\nmomentum.  Without Malaysia and the common market,  it\r\n\r\nis  likely  that this expansion will be  difficult  to\r\n\r\nsustain  beyond  a  few years,  even  under  the  most\r\n\r\nfavourable  conditions. In fact, without Malaysia,  it\r\n\r\nis  likely that we shall witness a return to political\r\n\r\nstrife inspired by the pro-Communist elements who  are\r\n\r\nnow  being  kept  under control. With  the  return  to\r\n\r\ninstability,  whatever gains that have  been  made  in\r\n\r\nrecent  months will be rapidly dissipated and economic\r\n\r\ndecline will inevitably set in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with Malaysia and the common market, we look\r\n\r\nforward  with  confidence not only to the continuation\r\n\r\nof  the  present rate of expansion but to  its  actual\r\n\r\nacceleration.  Industrial growth is likely  to  gather\r\n\r\nmomentum  from year to year after Malaysia and  before\r\n\r\nlong,  industry will be making a greater  contribution\r\n\r\nto our national income than trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important in the years to come that we deploy\r\n\r\nthe  maximum resources in money and men to  accelerate\r\n\r\nthe growth of our industries. At present, we have more\r\n\r\ncapital   than  we  can  profitably  use   in   direct\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  industry.  This  is  because  of   the\r\n\r\nlimitations of the present economic situation. But  it\r\n\r\nwill not be tong, however, before the position will be\r\n\r\nreversed when we shall be in need of more capital than\r\n\r\nin fact we possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent this can be made good by the inflow\r\n\r\nof  overseas  capital. But we must remember  that  the\r\n\r\nbasis of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture growth must come mostly from our own resources.\r\n\r\nFurther,  as  I shall explain soon, we shall  have  to\r\n\r\nbear  a  fair  share  of  the  responsibility  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision of capital for the development of the Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One encouraging element in our present situation is\r\n\r\nthe  slowing  down  of population growth  to  which  I\r\n\r\nearlier  referred. In future, the development  of  our\r\n\r\nsocial  services,  which is necessary  to  sustain  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  standard of living,  will  take  the  form\r\n\r\nlargely   of   improvement  of  quality  rather   than\r\n\r\nquantitative  extension  of  services   at   a   fixed\r\n\r\nstandard. While this decline in the rate of population\r\n\r\ngrowth is welcome, the present rate is still too  high\r\n\r\nand  we  should continue in our endeavours further  to\r\n\r\nreduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Malaysia as a whole, the future is full of\r\n\r\nboth  promise and challenge. There will be a territory\r\n\r\nof  129,000  square  miles with  a  population  of  10\r\n\r\nmillion.  The resources of the States of Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nvaluable  and  varied.  Much  of  these  still   await\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and exploitation. The Borneo  territories\r\n\r\nin  particular are in urgent need of development. They\r\n\r\nneed  to develop not only their natural resources  but\r\n\r\nalso to develop their social services, particularly in\r\n\r\neducation. A large section of the population in Borneo\r\n\r\nstill  live  in tribal societies often in  remote  and\r\n\r\ninaccessible  places.  The  cost  of  providing  these\r\n\r\ncommunities  with roads, schools, health services  and\r\n\r\nother  modern  amenities  will  involve  a  staggering\r\n\r\namount  of finance which is quite beyond their present\r\n\r\ndomestic   resources   to  provide.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nwealthier  sections of Malaysia, such  as  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore, must fulfil their obligation to provide the\r\n\r\ncapital that will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are likely to prosper in Malaysia and it is only\r\n\r\nright  that  a  share  of  the  additional  prosperity\r\n\r\nbrought about by Malaysia should be made available  to\r\n\r\nthe  under-developed parts of Malaysia. As  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the  Federation of Malaya  has  put  it,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will be the goose that will lay  the  golden\r\n\r\neggs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.

This  will\r\n\r\nbring  resentment in other States of Malaysia  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  end this will rebound to our disadvantage. At the\r\n\r\nsame time, we cannot share the golden eggs before they\r\n\r\nare laid. If I can mix my metaphors, we must not count\r\n\r\nour  golden geese before the eggs are hatched.  If  we\r\n\r\nprosper,  and the indications are that we will,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that the people of Singapore will not be wanting\r\n\r\nin generosity and enlightened self-interest in sharing\r\n\r\nthe additional prosperity with all in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we live in an era where momentous events are taking place.

There  is much wisdom in  this  approach.\r\n\r\nMalaysia will provide the solid framework within which\r\n\r\nwe   can   create  in  Singapore  a  progressive   and\r\n\r\nprosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Assembly approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the year l963.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  accordance with the resolution of this House,  the\r\n\r\ndebate now stands adjourned to\r\n\r\nTuesday, 11th of  June, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the assent of the House, probably we had better\r\n\r\nadjourn.
