Now  we  have,  in  fact,  two\r\n\r\nQuestions  which  affect  the  Member  for   Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar's  amendment.  The  first  Question  is   that\r\n\r\ncertain words that he proposes to leave out be  left\r\n\r\nout. That is being debated now, and in the course of\r\n\r\nthe  debate any Member may, of course, touch on  the\r\n\r\nwords which the hon. Member wishes to include.  That\r\n\r\nhas been done.

It is at that period that any Member  can\r\n\r\nmove amendments to that Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put the first Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the words proposed to be left out,\r\n\r\nbe left out,\" put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That is why, Sir, I supported the original\r\n\r\nmotion  and I was against the amendment which sought\r\n\r\nto  limit  the  service of television  to  a  public\r\n\r\ncorporation  without  consideration  of  any   other\r\n\r\npossibilities, because I feared, and I  still  fear,\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  we  seek to make it a public corporation and  do\r\n\r\nnot  investigate  the other possibilities,  we  will\r\n\r\nfind  it impossible to carry on or else take over  a\r\n\r\nburden with considerable liabilities which we cannot\r\n\r\nfully  envisage and which may gravely  reflect  upon\r\n\r\nour  capacity  to  deal  with  problems  of  a  more\r\n\r\npressing social character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment now proposed by my friend and\r\n\r\ncolleague the Minister for Health (Mr Braga),  Sir,\r\n\r\ntakes  away that objection, although it still leaves\r\n\r\nthe  objection of delay - and delay can be  important,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is not vital. In this instance, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  sentiments expressed - and expressed  with\r\n\r\nsome   force  and,  may  I  say,  with  some  logic - sentiments  of  fear,  even from  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nofficials,  that  to put this in the  hands  of  big\r\n\r\nbusiness would gravely prejudice the welfare of  the\r\n\r\ncountry - and it is very welcome that we should  have\r\n\r\nfrom  an official so refreshing a suspicion  of  big\r\n\r\nbusiness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the word \"Commission\" has been changed to\r\n\r\n\"Committee\"  for this one purpose: A Commission  has\r\n\r\nconsiderable  powers of compulsion, powers  to  take\r\n\r\nevidence   on  oath  and  to  force  production   of\r\n\r\ndocuments  and  attendance,  and  powers   to   take\r\n\r\nevidence in private as well as in public. Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthose   powers  should  not  be  lightly  given   or\r\n\r\nunnecessarily given. In a matter of this  character,\r\n\r\nthere  can be no reason whatsoever to fear that  any\r\n\r\norganisation  or  anybody who  is  invited  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence  would refrain from doing so. There  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  these powers of  compulsion,  and  a\r\n\r\nCommittee would be fully adequate because  it  would\r\n\r\nsimilarly  have  powers  to take  evidence  both  in\r\n\r\npublic  and in private. For the rest, Sir, it leaves\r\n\r\nthat Committee free to consider other aspects of the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of television without  the  limitation\r\n\r\nthat  is sought by the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  As\r\n\r\nmy  friend and colleague the Minister for Health has\r\n\r\npointed  out, it may well be that there could  be  a\r\n\r\nmarriage between public and private capital, Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  form of giving Government the control which  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  adequate and which I consider  necessary\r\n\r\nover television. It may be that even that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be impossible and the Committee would wish  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  that, though it is preferable to  have  a\r\n\r\npublic   corporation,   nevertheless,   because   of\r\n\r\ntechnical, organisational or financial difficulties,\r\n\r\ncommercial television be introduced for a  temporary\r\n\r\nperiod. We have this morning read that Indonesia has\r\n\r\naccepted  commercial television and  is  introducing\r\n\r\nit.  In  those circumstances, Sir, I, for one,  will\r\n\r\naccept  the  amendment proposed  by  my  friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Minister for Health - that a  Committee\r\n\r\nbe   appointed  to  investigate  the  possibilities.\r\n\r\nThough  I do regret that there should be this delay,\r\n\r\nI  do also recognise that if there is this wide  and\r\n\r\ngenuine fear of the threat of big business, then  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  that we should accept this  delay  in\r\n\r\norder to have the picture that the public wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nperhaps few of us remember that a few years back  we\r\n\r\nhad  an  exhibition in Singapore of television.  The\r\n\r\npublic  thought that television would be  here  very\r\n\r\nshortly,  but  years rolled by without  any  result.\r\n\r\nHowever,  some  steps,  in the  way  of  motions  or\r\n\r\namendments  to  motions, are now being taken - whether\r\n\r\nit  should  be  run  by a public corporation  or  by\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those democratic countries which are slowly\r\n\r\nproceeding towards Socialism have still a  love  for\r\n\r\nprivately-sponsored projects with  some  control  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, and if these projects are found  to\r\n\r\nbe  unsatisfactorily run later, then the  Government\r\n\r\ntakes over. After all, Sir, even the big states have\r\n\r\nnot been able to provide all the capital for all the\r\n\r\nnecessities,  and  that is why they  have  encouraged\r\n\r\nprivate capital to come forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  amendment  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  says\r\n\r\n\"public  corporation\", whereas the amendment  by  my\r\n\r\nfriend  the Hon. the Minister for Health (Mr Braga)\r\n\r\nleaves it to a Committee to decide whether it  wants\r\n\r\na  commercial institution, whether it wants a public\r\n\r\ncorporation, or whether it wants a marriage  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo. Commercial television is still in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

But if it\r\n\r\nis  the  wish of the Assembly that the matter should\r\n\r\nstill be pursued, it can, of course, be done.  I  am\r\n\r\nonly  pointing out what the procedure is. So, if  it\r\n\r\nis the wish of the Assembly that this question of  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  undertaking  should  still  be  in   the\r\n\r\npicture,  the debate on it can, of course, continue.\r\n\r\nIs that the wish of the Assembly then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am not pleading on this\r\n\r\nplatform  that we must have a commercial corporation\r\n\r\nto  do  that. Far from it. I am just putting forward\r\n\r\nthe  picture  of  how other countries  are  allowing\r\n\r\nprivate capital to come forward and help the country\r\n\r\nin certain projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this television exhibition I\r\n\r\nwas talking about just now,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  happened to ask one of the engineers who was there\r\n\r\nas  to what distance one could operate a station. If\r\n\r\nI  remember  it correctly, Sir, he told me  that  it\r\n\r\ncould   be  from  50  to  70  miles.  Now,  if   any\r\n\r\ncorporation, public or private, or Government is  to\r\n\r\noperate,   it  can  take  advantage  of  the   other\r\n\r\nterritories also to earn additional income and  also\r\n\r\ngive its benefits. Sir, we have forgotten altogether\r\n\r\nthis most important aspect. If a station can operate\r\n\r\nfrom  75  miles away, then it is possible  that  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring territory will also be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is this: Why not let the State\r\n\r\nrun this? But, then, Sir is the State big enough  to\r\n\r\ntake  up so many projects? Has it sufficient capital\r\n\r\nto  do so many things? I certainly say that we  have\r\n\r\nonly  got  a limited capacity. If we have a  limited\r\n\r\ncapacity, why not explore the possibility that other\r\n\r\nterritories might join, and here the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  (Mr Goode) brought in a very good  point\r\n\r\nin  this debate - that if it is to be a State project,\r\n\r\nwhy  not bring in broadcasting also? That is a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  point.  Broadcasting  serves   not   only\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not only the Federation,  but  also  our\r\n\r\nother neighbouring territories, Borneo, etc. and  it\r\n\r\nmight  be possible for a Committee or Commission  to\r\n\r\nexplore the possibility of getting these territories\r\n\r\nin,  because if they are interested, our burden will\r\n\r\nbe  less. It is very well to say why not put  up  so\r\n\r\nmany  million  dollars for this  and  that  project?\r\n\r\nWhere  are we going to get the money from? Sir,  our\r\n\r\nneighbours even have floated corporations where  the\r\n\r\nState  capital  is 51 per cent or 75  per  cent  and\r\n\r\nprivate  capital is less. The State has the  control\r\n\r\nbut  they  give up the management to a  properly-run\r\n\r\nprivate  organisation. I refer to a shipping company\r\n\r\nfloated  by the Government of India; 75 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  capital belongs to the Government  and  25  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  a private company, but the management  has\r\n\r\nbeen  handed over to the company. Sir, take the case\r\n\r\nof  the India National Airlines. It is a Government\r\n\r\nconcern and is capitalised by the Government. It  is\r\n\r\none of the best airlines, and second to none. Yet it\r\n\r\nhas been handed over to a private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany to run and it is doing wonderfully well.  It\r\n\r\nmay be State-cum-private capital too. We might bring\r\n\r\nin   other   interested  territories.   The   bigger\r\n\r\nterritories should have more interest. I do not know\r\n\r\nif  I  am  in  order,  Sir,  but  this  was  debated\r\n\r\nyesterday. Take the railways, for example. It  is  a\r\n\r\nFederation  affair.  Airlines may  be  a  Federation\r\n\r\naffair   too,  because  a  major  portion   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  served by them.  The  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not take on their own shoulders  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  which  is not  entirely  their  own.\r\n\r\nPublic   internal  transport  is,  of  course,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility.  They  can  take  over\r\n\r\ntelevision   if  they  want  to,  but   when   other\r\n\r\nterritories  are interested, we have  got  to  think\r\n\r\nwisely. Whether a Committee is appointed to consider\r\n\r\nthe question or whether it should be a Commission is\r\n\r\nimmaterial;  but if broadcasting is to  come  in,  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  Commission might be better.  However,  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Secretary has not moved an amendment\r\n\r\nto bring in broadcasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a Commission is appointed to consider only\r\n\r\ntelevision, the procedure would be rather  laborious\r\n\r\nand expensive. A Committee might do quicker work.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest, not a Committee of this House, but an\r\n\r\nad  hoc  Committee  which  should  also  consist  of\r\n\r\nexperts who can give us really good advice, check on\r\n\r\nthe  information  received, and make recommendations\r\n\r\naccordingly to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  had  a  very  open mind when the debate  on  this\r\n\r\nmotion started, but the excellent exposition by  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Secretary persuaded me to think that\r\n\r\nthe  course he has suggested is the best one in that\r\n\r\nthere is every possibility that television could  be\r\n\r\neconomically  run by the Broadcasting Department  in\r\n\r\nconjunction     with,    possibly,     advertisement\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  To  me,  who  has  been  both  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  in  business,  that  is   a   great\r\n\r\nattraction.   I   have  known  how   expensive   any\r\n\r\nundertaking  can be when run by Government,  but  in\r\n\r\nthis  case  we have an existing corporation  dealing\r\n\r\nwith   practically  the  same  line   as   that   of\r\n\r\ntelevision. We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  the  buildings there, quite a bit of equipment,\r\n\r\nthe  personnel,  and  the new venture  can  well  be\r\n\r\nundertaken  by the existing staff with  an  addition\r\n\r\nof,  say,  half the number which would  normally  be\r\n\r\nrequired by a new corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we are persuaded that we should take time to\r\n\r\nthink  and make enquiries before we proceed further,\r\n\r\nthen  I  agree with the amendment suggested  by  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Health, to the effect that the\r\n\r\nenquiry  should be conducted fully and  not  limited\r\n\r\njust  to  a public corporation. I therefore heartily\r\n\r\nsupport this amendment moved by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister appears to prefer a Committee rather than a\r\n\r\nCommission, because he feels that a body which is to\r\n\r\ninvestigate a very important subject would not  have\r\n\r\nthe  powers of compelling witnesses to speak on oath\r\n\r\nand  make  other  requests  for  the  disclosure  of\r\n\r\ninformation.  I  think the Chief  Minister  probably\r\n\r\ndoes not realise that such an enquiry would have  to\r\n\r\nbe  extensive and thorough, and a Commission  is  by\r\n\r\nfar  the  more effective way of getting  information\r\n\r\nbefore  the members of such a Commission. I  am  not\r\n\r\ndogmatic in my approach to television being under  a\r\n\r\npublic  authority.  I  am  prepared  to  meet  those\r\n\r\nMembers   who  wish  to  have  this  Commission   or\r\n\r\nCommittee  which will investigate the  possibilities\r\n\r\nof  television  under some other  authority  than  a\r\n\r\npublic   authority.  But  I   feel   that   such   a\r\n\r\nCommission - I  would  prefer a  Commission - should  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  pay  particular regard to,  and  to  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations on, the best way in which it  should\r\n\r\nbe introduced in Singapore. It might be well to give\r\n\r\nthis Commission sufficient scope so as to include in\r\n\r\nits   deliberations  the  question  of  broadcasting\r\n\r\ntogether with that of television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, an amendment which I hope will\r\n\r\nmeet the views of those Members of this House who do\r\n\r\nnot   wish  the  Commission  to  be  tied  down   to\r\n\r\ninvestigating   only  television  under   a   public\r\n\r\nauthority  but  under any other  authority.  Such  a\r\n\r\nCommission  could, at the same time,  be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity    to   investigate    and    to    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations on the setting up of a public cor-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nporation  to  run both broadcasting  and  television\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Some  persons think that  television  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  idea  and,  after talking  to  some  friends,\r\n\r\ndecide  to  invite tenders. Some persons  get  angry\r\n\r\nbecause  others criticise them for the way in  which\r\n\r\nthings  are done; or they object to amendments  even\r\n\r\nif  they are reasonable - indeed particularly if  they\r\n\r\nare reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever happens at the end of this debate I hope\r\n\r\nthe  House will remember that Members of an Assembly\r\n\r\ncome and go, but institutions like broadcasting  and\r\n\r\ntelevision may go on, if not forever, at least  long\r\n\r\nafter  we are gone. We should sit back now and  think\r\n\r\nover  the possibility of doing something on  a  firm\r\n\r\nand  steady basis. I must thank the Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nfor having introduced broadcasting into this debate.\r\n\r\nI  had  wanted to introduce this subject of bringing\r\n\r\nbroadcasting   and  television  under   one   public\r\n\r\nauthority, but I thought that if I went that  far  I\r\n\r\nmight   antagonise   sufficient   Members   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment side to make it impossible for my  motion\r\n\r\never to get through. But I now find support from  an\r\n\r\nofficial  for  the idea of putting broadcasting  and\r\n\r\ntelevision together. Of course, the official view is\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be  better if  both  were  under  a\r\n\r\nGovernment department. My view is that it  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter  if  both  were under an  independent  public\r\n\r\nauthority. Members of the Opposition will  therefore\r\n\r\nhave  less  reason  to  suspect  any  bias  in   the\r\n\r\npresentation of any views, or any particular kind of\r\n\r\nview,  over  a Government broadcasting or television\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am against this amendment by the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health because:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I do not think a Committee is adequate for\r\n\r\nthis purpose; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I consider this is an appropriate time to have\r\n\r\na  Commission  appointed, not only  to  explore  the\r\n\r\npossibilities of commercial or State television  but\r\n\r\nalso  to consider whether this is not the right time\r\n\r\nto bring broadcasting together with television under\r\n\r\none authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the House therefore to support me in\r\n\r\nrejecting  the  Minister for Health's  amendment.  I\r\n\r\nwould invite it to amend my amendment in order  that\r\n\r\nthis  Commission will have the power to  investigate\r\n\r\nthe  question  of broadcasting and television  being\r\n\r\nplaced under one authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the processes of\r\n\r\ndemocracy is often accused of being rather slow, and\r\n\r\nI  must  say that they have been strikingly slow  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly during the sittings of the  last  two\r\n\r\ndays and today. I do personally believe that in this\r\n\r\nparticular   debate  on  television,  we   are   all\r\n\r\nsubstantially agreed that what we want  is  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  matter examined and have the information before\r\n\r\nus  on which we can make up our minds. I do not feel\r\n\r\nthere  is  any great substance in whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nCommission or a Committee. There is no matter that I\r\n\r\ncan  see which is likely to call for judicial powers\r\n\r\nto  enforce  people to give evidence on oath  or  to\r\n\r\ncompel  secret  papers  to  be  produced.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing much to consider except possibilities in the\r\n\r\nfuture.  There  is  nothing  much  in  the  past  in\r\n\r\ntelevision which we can hope to examine,  and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think that point is very significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, I am quite satisfied with a Committee\r\n\r\nprovided it is well planned and competent to do  its\r\n\r\nwork.  I  do  not  think it will  be  obstructed  by\r\n\r\ninability  to  compel evidence.  I  think  that  the\r\n\r\nvarious points that have been raised since the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health put his amendment can all be\r\n\r\ndealt   with   quite  adequately   without   further\r\n\r\ndiscussion here, by giving an undertaking  that  the\r\n\r\nterms of reference for the Committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be so framed that whatever the representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  people  want  to  be  considered  shall  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.  We do not have to frame  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference  in  this House. We can  indicate  broadly\r\n\r\nwhat the intention of the House is, and it is up  to\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of reference to indicate precisely  what\r\n\r\nthe  functions of the Committee are. I am sure there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  difficulty  about  framing  terms   of\r\n\r\nreference   which  will  be  satisfactory   to   all\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only rise to make this suggestion, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  because I feel that at present we have  got  a\r\n\r\nkite  up in the air with an endless stream of little\r\n\r\namendments  attached to its tail, and if  we  go  on\r\n\r\nattaching further and further amendments we shall be\r\n\r\nhere  until  we recess for our tiffin and  we  shall\r\n\r\nstill  have got very little further with  our  Order\r\n\r\nPaper;  and  I  can see the sitting going  on  until\r\n\r\nmaybe ten o'clock or twelve o'clock at night or into\r\n\r\nthe early hours of tomorrow before we get away if we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  spend a lot of time debating  what  is\r\n\r\nreally  not  much more than a procedural  point.  So\r\n\r\npersonally,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  be  glad  to\r\n\r\naccept  the amendment of the Minister for Health  on\r\n\r\nthe  understanding that the Committee would be given\r\n\r\nadequate terms of reference to deal with the matters\r\n\r\nwhich have been raised in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.

The\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Secretary made it very clear to this\r\n\r\nAssembly yesterday that more than 50 per cent of the\r\n\r\npopulation are below the age of 21. This controversy\r\n\r\nabout  the  introduction of television in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been going on for some time, although there has\r\n\r\nbeen no official suggestion as to its introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no strong views about television in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because I have always thought  that  its\r\n\r\nintroduction  in  Singapore  will  not  benefit  the\r\n\r\nordinary  man  in  the street  very  much.  I  would\r\n\r\nrequest  the Government to consider this matter  and\r\n\r\nto  so  frame the terms of reference as to  meet  my\r\n\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

I have noticed that\r\n\r\nradio,  broadcasting  and newspapers  are  all  very\r\n\r\nimportant media whereby ideas can be passed.  Radio,\r\n\r\nespecially, is a suitable pastime for people. I also\r\n\r\nknow   the   great  importance  of  the  cinema   in\r\n\r\nentertaining people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no very strong views against\r\n\r\ntelevision, and I am just saying what is in my  mind\r\n\r\nas  a private citizen. From my observations, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  do not have many industries in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  I think the first need of Singapore is to  have\r\n\r\nmore  money  put  into industry.  The  question  has\r\n\r\noccurred to me whether it would be right for  us  to\r\n\r\nencourage    investment   in   another    form    of\r\n\r\nentertainment or whether it would not be better that\r\n\r\nthe  people who have capital should be persuaded  to\r\n\r\nset  up more industries so as to boost up production\r\n\r\nfor the sake of greater national wealth. We do want,\r\n\r\nof  course, some sort of entertainment too, but I am\r\n\r\nof  the  opinion  that if we have television  coming\r\n\r\ninto Singapore, we must consider what section of the\r\n\r\npeople  it  will benefit. A television set,  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen told, would cost between $800 and $1,000. I  am\r\n\r\nwondering whether this amenity, when it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomes to Singapore, will ever reach the common man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Will it ever reach the homes\r\n\r\nof  people  who  earn  $100 or  $200?  Sir,  as  has\r\n\r\noccurred  in  other  lands,  television  sets   will\r\n\r\nprobably be set up in public houses, in coffee-shops\r\n\r\n(as  we  have  them here) or in bars. It  will  then\r\n\r\ncreate  a  situation whereby the man in the  street,\r\n\r\nwho  cannot afford to own a television set,  may  be\r\n\r\nattracted  to  get into a bar or a  coffee-shop  and\r\n\r\nthen glue his eyes on to the television set, instead\r\n\r\r\nof  spending more time with his family at  home.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  you  know,  the family  should  be  the\r\n\r\nstrongest  unit  in democracy and we  should  always\r\n\r\nmake the man stick to his family. I therefore wonder\r\n\r\nhow much this is going to take the man away from his\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, there is the question of the\r\n\r\nprogrammes. Whether they are good or bad depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  people behind them. It is just like  a  double-edged sword. It can cut one way and do good. It  can\r\n\r\ncut the other way and demoralise the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand and I do appreciate the fact that\r\n\r\nT.V. is a modern form of entertainment available  in\r\n\r\nall  advanced nations, and because of that we should\r\n\r\nalso  have  this  amenity.  But  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  if  it ever sits down  to  consider  its\r\n\r\nterms  of reference, to consider also the points  of\r\n\r\nview that I have put forward in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

For some time, various proposals for  a\r\n\r\nscheme of this nature have been under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is making every effort, through  the\r\n\r\nagency of the Singapore Improvement Trust, to  build\r\n\r\nas  many houses and flats as possible for letting at\r\n\r\nlow  rents,  but we consider it desirable  that  the\r\n\r\nopportunity should be given to members of the public\r\n\r\nin  the  lower income groups to buy their own homes.\r\n\r\nMany  houses  are  now  being  built  for  sale   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  by  private enterprise, but  we  consider\r\n\r\nthat it is desirable to supplement these efforts  by\r\n\r\nbuilding small, well-planned houses as cheaply as is\r\n\r\ncompatible  with  good  construction,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of home ownership may be extended  as  far\r\n\r\ndown the lower income groups as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore now proposed that the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, as the direct agent of Government\r\n\r\nin  this  matter, should be advanced funds up  to  a\r\n\r\nlimit  of  $1  million  at  any  time  for  building\r\n\r\nsuitable  types  of cheap houses.  This  expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  be  recouped when the houses are sold and  the\r\n\r\nmoney   used  again  for  further  building.   These\r\n\r\nadvances  will  therefore be  in  the  nature  of  a\r\n\r\nrevolving  fund which, it is hoped,  will  enable  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial number of houses to be built and sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A block of 68 houses in Queenstown, which the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust has already built,  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken over for sale under this scheme and  plans\r\n\r\nfor  further building are being put in hand. I would\r\n\r\nemphasise that this scheme is entirely additional to\r\n\r\nthe Trust's present\r\n\r\nand  future programmes for building houses and flats\r\n\r\nfor  letting,  and  it  is not intended  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  any reduction in the tempo  of  building\r\n\r\nunder   those   programmes   on   account   of   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this new scheme for  building  for\r\n\r\nhome ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also explain to hon. Members that it is\r\n\r\nnot Government's intention to make any profit out of\r\n\r\nthis   scheme.  Some  small  variations   from   the\r\n\r\nestimates  will  be  inevitable,  but  the   general\r\n\r\nprinciple will be that the purchase price should  be\r\n\r\nthe  actual cost to Government. Taking one programme\r\n\r\nwith  another over a period, the advances  which  we\r\n\r\nmake  available under this scheme will be  preserved\r\n\r\nintact,  but  with  no accumulation  on  account  of\r\n\r\ninterest or profit for use in further schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the scheme. Government has had to\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind that the maximum loan which  building\r\n\r\nsocieties  are  normally prepared to  offer  on  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of an individual house and plot of land  is\r\n\r\nonly  80 per cent of their valuation. It was thought\r\n\r\nthat  to  introduce a scheme whereby each  purchaser\r\n\r\nhad to lay down at least 20 per cent of the value of\r\n\r\nthe  house,  would  tend  to restrict  severely  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people  who  could  participate  in  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  A  special arrangement has  therefore  been\r\n\r\nmade with the Federal and Colonial Building Society,\r\n\r\nLtd.,  whereby under this scheme loans of up  to  90\r\n\r\nper cent of the agreed valuation may be made by that\r\n\r\nSociety,   so  that  in  each  case  the  individual\r\n\r\npurchaser  will  have to make a minimum  deposit  of\r\n\r\nonly  ten  per cent of the valuation.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  with  this Society that Government  and  the\r\n\r\nSociety  should  share equally the  additional  risk\r\n\r\nwhich  the Society will incur by making loans of  up\r\n\r\nto  90  per  cent of the valuation, instead  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  limit  of  80  per  cent.  Government  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  guaranteeing  the  repayment  to  the\r\n\r\nSociety of one-half of that part of any loan made by\r\n\r\nthe  Society under this scheme which exceeds 80  per\r\n\r\ncent  but does not exceed 90 per cent of the  agreed\r\n\r\nvaluation.  The  Society has agreed  to  this  joint\r\n\r\nguarantee for properties valued at $8,000 and below,\r\n\r\nbut  it  should be noted that Government's intention\r\n\r\nis  to  build houses for sale at prices  much  lower\r\n\r\nthan that limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need take up Members' time\r\n\r\nfurther on this subject, and I will leave it  to  my\r\n\r\nhon. colleague  the Minister for Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Housing to explain further details of the scheme\r\n\r\nand  to  refer  to the conditions which  it  is  his\r\n\r\nintention  to lay down. I will merely add that  this\r\n\r\nscheme   is   essentially  in  the  nature   of   an\r\n\r\nexperiment. We do not know what the demand is likely\r\n\r\nto  be, but Government feels that it will be a  very\r\n\r\ndesirable  step  to  afford  facilities   for   home\r\n\r\nownership to those sections of the community to whom\r\n\r\nthey  are  not at present available. Sir, I  beg  to\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise to second the  motion.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment, when it took office, announced  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  its  intention  to  find  ways  and  means   of\r\n\r\nencouraging those in the lower income group  to  own\r\n\r\ntheir  own  homes.  This scheme is  the  first  step\r\n\r\ntowards that end. The houses are to be sold at their\r\n\r\nreal  cost, due allowance being made for appropriate\r\n\r\noverheads. They will be offered to families  with  a\r\n\r\njoint income from all sources of not more than  $400\r\n\r\na  month.  Preference will be given to wage-earners.\r\n\r\nThe  title  to  the houses will be a  99-year  lease\r\n\r\nwhich   will   contain  a  limited  restriction   of\r\n\r\nassignment. This restriction is designed to  prevent\r\n\r\nthem  from  falling  into the hands  of  speculative\r\n\r\nbuyers.  Amongst  the restrictions which  Government\r\n\r\nhas  in mind and which it most certainly will insist\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That houses are to be used for residential\r\n\r\npurposes by the owner occupier;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sub-leases shall not be assigned either in\r\n\r\nwhole  or in part without the written permission  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Improvement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the houses are sold, more\r\n\r\nhouses will be built from the proceeds of the  sale.\r\n\r\nWith  a  fund  of $1 million it will be possible  to\r\n\r\nbuild  approximately 200 houses each year.  If  this\r\n\r\nscheme  meets  with the success which  we  think  it\r\n\r\ndeserves,  consideration  will  be  given   to   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of making a larger sum available for  this\r\n\r\npurpose. I should like to repeat, however, what  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary has said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust  now,  and  that  is  this - it  is  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  that this scheme should be  supplementary\r\n\r\nto and not in any way in replacement of the existing\r\n\r\nS.I.T. building  programme. While building  for  sale\r\n\r\nwill,  to some extent, help to conserve the  capital\r\n\r\nresources  of  Government, the main  object  of  the\r\n\r\nproposal  is  to  foster a community of  responsible\r\n\r\nhome-owners,  a  community which  will  add  to  the\r\n\r\nstrength and stability of the new Singapore which we\r\n\r\nare  planning. I trust, Sir, that this is  a  motion\r\n\r\nwhich hon. Members from both sides of the House will\r\n\r\nbe able to give their wholehearted support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on a point of information.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has  indicated that  he  expects  200\r\n\r\nhouses to be built.

Could  we  have  more\r\n\r\ninformation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) As to the type of houses being built and the\r\n\r\ncost; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As to how these 200 houses a year is arrived at\r\n\r\nout of this $1 million?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas to the type of houses which we intend to build, I\r\n\r\nshould  think the Singapore Improvement  Trust  will\r\n\r\nprobably build the type of houses that are now being\r\n\r\nput  up  along Guillemard Road which, I  understand,\r\n\r\ncost approximately between $4,000 and $5,000 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the revolving fund, I did say just now\r\n\r\nthat,  with a fund of $1 million, it is possible  to\r\n\r\nbuild  200 houses a year. As a beginning, Sir,  this\r\n\r\nwill  be so, but as loans are being given and houses\r\n\r\nare  being bought by wage-earners, I anticipate that\r\n\r\nthis  figure  will keep on increasing from  year  to\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a further point of information,\r\n\r\nSir. If  $1 million purchases 200 houses at  $5,000\r\n\r\neach,  and they are bought by members of the public,\r\n\r\nthen  the following year the capital would not  have\r\n\r\ncome back to build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  200  houses.

This  is  in   pursuance   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to give interest-free  loans  to\r\n\r\nbuy houses. We give the S.I.T. $1 million. It builds\r\n\r\n200   houses.  It  sells  them  to  people  who   go\r\n\r\nimmediately  to  the Federal and  Colonial  Building\r\n\r\nSociety and say, \"We want to buy a house for $5,000.\r\n\r\nWill you loan us 90 per cent of it, which is $4,500?\r\n\r\nHere  is $500.\" So the Society gives the $4,500 plus\r\n\r\nthe  $500  to  the purchaser. The purchaser  himself\r\n\r\nremains  indebted  to the Society,  but  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\n(which  is  already building in the meanwhile)  gets\r\n\r\nits $1 million immediately on sale and that pays for\r\n\r\nthe  next 200 houses which it resells. Have  I  made\r\n\r\nmyself clear, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I understand it, Sir, $1\r\n\r\nmillion is given to the S.I.T.

They each go across  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  and Colonial Building Society and put  $500\r\n\r\ndown.  Then  they get $4,500 from the Society  as  a\r\n\r\nloan.  The $500 deposit plus the $4,500 is thereupon\r\n\r\nsent  back to the S.I.T. which builds another house.\r\n\r\nBut  the  man  who goes to the Society  to  get  the\r\n\r\n$4,500  will have to pay interest on the $4,500.

A man who has $5,000,\r\n\r\nSir,  can  then go to the S.I.T. and buy this  house\r\n\r\nwhich has been built on a loan free of interest  and\r\n\r\nat  a  cost  much lower or lower than it would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  if the S.I.T. had to borrow money at four  per\r\n\r\ncent  or  more,  as  it does now.

The  subsidy  from  Government  is  two-fold.\r\n\r\nFirst,  there is a normal subsidy to the  S.I.T. in\r\n\r\nclearing  the  sites and giving certain  allocations\r\n\r\nper acre in respect of all sites on which the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nbuilds. That is the normal subsidy in respect of all\r\n\r\nS.I.T. buildings.  But  the  second   subsidy   is\r\n\r\nthis - that  in the normal course, whether it  is  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. or a contractor, to start building,  capital\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be produced and that capital  carries\r\n\r\ninterest.  The  S.I.T. would, in the normal  course,\r\n\r\npay  interest at market rates, six per cent or more,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  moment  it starts building - not  from  the\r\n\r\nmoment the building is finished - until it sells it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Sir, the loan is intended to\r\n\r\ncontinue and we hope to give further loans, so  that\r\n\r\nif  this experiment is a success, there will be more\r\n\r\nthan  200  houses built and sold to the public.  The\r\n\r\npurchaser benefits from:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) absence of the additional cost of the charge\r\n\r\nof interest from a normal contractor;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) absence from the profits of a normal\r\n\r\ncontractor; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the normal subsidy of Government to the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I have elucidation from the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister with reference to the normal subsidy\r\n\r\nto the S.I.T.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

In\r\n\r\nthis case, I do not think the idea of the public and\r\n\r\nhis  idea coincide at all. An interest-free loan  to\r\n\r\nbuy a house means that the purchaser gets it free of\r\n\r\ninterest; but this morning's exposition by the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister would imply that only the interest on  that\r\n\r\nmillion dollars which is sought to be loaned to the\r\n\r\nS.I.T should be waived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind then, the advantages accruing to the\r\n\r\npurchasers  of these low-cost houses are these:  the\r\n\r\nsaving  of  this interest; no profit by the  S.I.T.;\r\n\r\ncheaper  construction by the S.I.T. because  of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  they have and the big numbers  they  are\r\n\r\nproducing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to this motion, our Party welcomes this measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

As long as four years ago, I  advocated\r\n\r\nin the Press the sale of Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nhouses  and  flats  already  built  to  the  public,\r\n\r\nbecause I pointed out that the requirement of 10,000\r\n\r\nunits per year, which would involve a commitment  of\r\n\r\n$50 millions by Government, could not be undertaken;\r\n\r\nand more so today in conjunction with the efforts we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  make to create more industries  and\r\n\r\ngive    better    working    conditions    to    the\r\n\r\nunderprivileged people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now see that people who are well off can\r\n\r\nbuild their own houses; people with moderate incomes\r\n\r\nare being provided for by the housing societies; and\r\n\r\nit  is only those people in the low income group who\r\n\r\nmust  be  subsidised  to a certain  extent  by  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Although it is a small  effort - it  will\r\n\r\nonly  involve 200 houses - nevertheless, it is a  very\r\n\r\nwelcome one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that has been worrying us is that\r\n\r\nwe   do  not  have  enough  information,  and   this\r\n\r\nmorning's debate clearly illustrates that possibly a\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  should have been produced before  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We  could have studied it and we could  have\r\n\r\nsaved  at  least ten minutes of our time  trying  to\r\n\r\nfind out what type of houses are being provided  for\r\n\r\nand  under  what conditions they are to be  sold.  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  point out that we have to be very  careful\r\n\r\nhow  these  houses are going to be allocated.  There\r\n\r\nare only 200 of them and there may be complaints  of\r\n\r\nfavouritism;  so  I  would advisedly  point  out  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  that it is much better to  let  us  have\r\n\r\neverything  clear-cut. As this is, to  my  mind,  an\r\n\r\nextremely  urgent  matter, I  am  not  proposing  an\r\n\r\nadjournment. I hope that this motion will be  passed\r\n\r\ntoday so that we can straightaway go and dispose of\r\n\r\nthese 200 houses. But at a later stage, when another\r\n\r\nloan  is  asked for, I do hope that all  the  points\r\n\r\nwill be given to us in a White Paper and we can then\r\n\r\nstudy the whole question without having to spend  so\r\n\r\nmuch time in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that raises a doubt in my mind is\r\n\r\nthe second part of the motion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   asks  this  Assembly  to  \"note   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to guarantee repayment  of  one\r\n\r\nhalf  of  that part of any loan made by the  Federal\r\n\r\nand  Colonial Building Society, Ltd., in respect  of\r\n\r\nany  such houses which exceeds 80 per cent but  does\r\n\r\nnot  exceed 90 per cent of the agreed valuation.\"  I\r\n\r\nam  always averse to Government committing itself to\r\n\r\nany guarantees, and it would appear that a guarantee\r\n\r\nof  this  nature might also affect any other private\r\n\r\nconcern which would try to build for people in  this\r\n\r\nincome  group.  But  on  reflection,  I  feel  that,\r\n\r\nbecause the amount involved and the risk incurred is\r\n\r\nso  small, and the advantages that it would give  to\r\n\r\nthe  purchaser are so great, I am prepared to  waive\r\n\r\nthat  objection.  I  do hope that  the  Federal  and\r\n\r\nColonial  Building Society and other loan  societies\r\n\r\nwould take all this into consideration and give  the\r\n\r\nsame concession as they have agreed to do now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these thoughts, Sir, and so as not to delay\r\n\r\nthe lower income group from getting these houses  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible, I hope Members will approve  this\r\n\r\nmotion today, and I am quite confident that a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  will  be  produced  in  the  future  for  our\r\n\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

In  the  previous\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council I have many a time argued  that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the people in Singapore do not  own  their\r\n\r\nhomes  and that it is highly desirable that  such  a\r\n\r\nstep  should be taken. I hope today that the  people\r\n\r\nwho  will be benefited by this scheme are the  wage-earners. These people have been paying rent all  the\r\n\r\ntime  and they have never had any incentive  to  own\r\n\r\ntheir  own homes. I hope and believe that the  wage-earning  class of Singapore will take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthis scheme and let the Government 'stump up' more and\r\n\r\nmore money for a scheme of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to comment on those aspects which\r\n\r\ndeal  with the Federal and Colonial Building Society\r\n\r\nand  the  interest-free loan at this  time,  because\r\n\r\ncomments may be forthcoming after the first sale  of\r\n\r\nthese  houses built by the S.I.T.

However\r\n\r\nI   think  he  should  realise  by  now  that  I  am\r\n\r\nimpervious to silly criticism from those  for  whose\r\n\r\nintellectual capacity I have the greatest wonderment\r\n\r\nbut no desire to emulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are being told today is that a\r\n\r\nmountain  has produced a mouse. We were  told,  once\r\n\r\nupon a time, that this island was going to be turned\r\n\r\ninto a property-owning democracy and one of the ways\r\n\r\nin  which the Government was going to do it  was  to\r\n\r\nbuild  houses  and make everybody petty bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nEverybody was going to get a $5,000 house,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was going to do it in a big way - interest\r\n\r\nfree. You buy as you pay your rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it turns out that the two advantages that a\r\n\r\npurchaser  gets from buying one of these  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidised houses, instead of buying somebody else's\r\n\r\nhouse, is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That interest is not charged for the time in\r\n\r\nwhich capital has been expended and before sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No profit is being made by the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the S.I.T. would compute in the\r\n\r\ncost its administrative expenses? It would! So,  the\r\n\r\nsituation now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis that the S.I.T. does not charge a profit for its\r\n\r\nentrepreneuring effort. As I understand it from  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing,  in  terms of dollars and cents,  it  would\r\n\r\namount  to  $500  to  $600. Sir, assuming  that  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. is an economical and efficient builder,  one\r\n\r\nwould, by buying an S.I.T.-built house, saves  about\r\n\r\n$600 and the sort of profits which associates of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon in their building enterprises\r\n\r\nwould add on. But if the S.I.T. is not efficient and\r\n\r\ncompetitive in costs, then it may well  be  that  no\r\n\r\nadvantage at all would be gained by buying an S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouse.  However, for the purposes of my argument,  I\r\n\r\nwill  assume that the S.I.T. is as efficient as  any\r\n\r\nother  builder, perhaps even more efficient so  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   some  advantage.  On  that   basis,   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Government for working out a  very\r\n\r\ncheap  scheme  which will help about 200  people  to\r\n\r\nhouse  themselves each year, provided they are  able\r\n\r\nto  earn  not  less than $400 a month.  I  have  not\r\n\r\nworked it out mathematically, but, at a rough guess,\r\n\r\nI  would say that a family must be prepared  to  pay\r\n\r\nnot less than $120 a month towards repayment of that\r\n\r\nloan of $5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be that this is one way to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  housing  situation in the middle income  group,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is no more than a mockery of a solution  to\r\n\r\nthe   housing  problem.  We  were  told,   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  took office, which they  were  going  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the problem of housing. They  said  they\r\n\r\nfully  appreciated the tremendous  pressure  of  our\r\n\r\nincreasing population and the urgent need  to  clear\r\n\r\nthe  slums and build houses. We were told that there\r\n\r\nwould   be  a  Housing  Authority  to  replace   the\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. We were told that this was one of\r\n\r\nthe  important targets of the Labour Front. We  were\r\n\r\ntold  today by the Hon. the Financial Secretary that\r\n\r\nbuilding  by the S.I.T. for collection of rent  will\r\n\r\ngo  on  as  it  has always been going on.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nhousing  problem  will never be solved  as  long  as\r\n\r\nbuilding  by the S.I.T. goes on in the  way  it  has\r\n\r\ngone on over the past five, six or seven years,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so long as the only innovation introduced by the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  a  property-owning   scheme   which\r\n\r\nproduces  200 houses for purchase on the  instalment\r\n\r\nplan  via  the  good  services of  the  Federal  and\r\n\r\nColonial  Building Society. I need not elaborate  on\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  said  before when  I  criticised  the\r\n\r\nBudget.

But if he does\r\n\r\nnot  put  his  back  to the wheel,  if  the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem is not solved, then his Government will fail\r\n\r\ndismally. It has made grandiose promises. It has the\r\n\r\ncapacity to fulfil a great part of them. It has  the\r\n\r\npower. It can raise taxation. But it threw away  $19\r\n\r\nmillions on tobacco.

This is a revolving loan which  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  remain with the S.I.T. and  is  going  to\r\n\r\nremain free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim\r\n\r\nKoon  Teck)  drew  attention to the  question  of  a\r\n\r\nGovernment guarantee. I will confess that originally\r\n\r\nI  did not care for it, but the point is this. There\r\n\r\nare many people who are unable to afford $1,000 as a\r\n\r\ndeposit,  and this Building Society would  not  lend\r\n\r\nmore than 80 per cent. Nor would any Society that we\r\n\r\ncould  contact  lend more than 80 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nvaluation.  So, in order to encourage a larger  loan\r\n\r\nto  facilitate purchase by those who are  unable  to\r\n\r\nplace a deposit of more than $500, we have agreed to\r\n\r\nthis  guarantee  which, as has been rightly  pointed\r\n\r\nout,   Sir,  does  not  involve  us  in  an   unknown\r\n\r\nliability. The liability as known is not excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice the jibe, Sir, that we are supporting one\r\n\r\nprivate corporation. Again, Sir, I must confess that\r\n\r\nI  was  not particularly happy, but when the factors\r\n\r\nare   investigated  there  seems  to  be  no   other\r\n\r\norganisation  prepared to give us  equal  or  better\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Nor is Government in a  position - it  is\r\n\r\nnot advisable at the present moment, but it could if\r\n\r\nit  wanted to - to set up an organisation to deal with\r\n\r\nthese loans. It may be that if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme is, in fact, as successful as we hope it will\r\n\r\nbe, then other steps will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come to this House in the last two\r\n\r\ndays  seeking to tackle, step by step,  our  housing\r\n\r\nproblem.  Yesterday, I think it was, my  friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing  indicated that we  were  reducing  the\r\n\r\ninterest  on  all loans to the Singapore Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust. All loans, Sir, which at present carry  three\r\n\r\nand  four per cent, we are reducing to two per cent.\r\n\r\nIt  will  cost us $1 million this year and  it  will\r\n\r\ncost the country progressively more each year. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom the question of the study at the present moment\r\n\r\nof  special legislation in order to enable the  sale\r\n\r\nof  S.I.T. flats and building to the public, so that\r\n\r\nGovernment can carry out its own policy - and in  this\r\n\r\nconnection I am happy to note that we have at  least\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar with us - we are  awaiting\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a Housing Authority which will,\r\n\r\nwe  hope,  be  an independent Authority,  with  full\r\n\r\nGovernment financial support, in order to  implement\r\n\r\nour  housing  plan which will be presented  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse before it is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the scheme\r\n\r\nthat  has  just been presented to this  House  is  a\r\n\r\ntimely  one.  In  Singapore,  Sir,  there  are  many\r\n\r\nprivate  builders  but most of them  want  only  one\r\n\r\nthing - and  that is profit.

He will be able to get a house that is within\r\n\r\nhis  means. A worker, Sir, who earns a small sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  usually, finds that it is difficult to  save.\r\n\r\nIt  is  difficult for him to save money on his  own,\r\n\r\nbut with the arrangement of loans as set out, it  is\r\n\r\npossible for him to do some sort of forced saving,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as joining a \"tontine\".

If we talk about people  in  the  low\r\n\r\nincome  group, there are many people  who  can  come\r\n\r\nwithin  this  category.

The Director of this creche has hitherto been\r\n\r\nvery  cooperative  with  the  Department  of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare.

At that time, there were  some\r\n\r\nmisgivings  as to what our attitude was. Today,  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of  this Bill  coincides  with  the\r\n\r\nemergence  of the new Liberal-Socialist  Party,  and\r\n\r\nthe  first act of this Party is to introduce a piece\r\n\r\nof  social  legislation that will be good  for  all,\r\n\r\nespecially so for the clerical people and  the  shop\r\n\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will have seen in the explanatory note,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is intended to protect a large number  of\r\n\r\nemployees who find it difficult to come together  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out collective bargaining with a large number\r\n\r\nof  employers in various trades and industries.  The\r\n\r\nlargest  section  of these workers comes  under  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of shop employees. As hon.  Members  are\r\n\r\nthemselves aware, Singapore is a city of many shops.\r\n\r\nYou  find them more highly concentrated in the city,\r\n\r\nbut even in the remote areas you do find many shops.\r\n\r\nBorn  and bred in Singapore, and constantly  rubbing\r\n\r\nshoulders  with  the common man in the  city - I  have\r\n\r\nmany friends working as clerks and shop assistants - I\r\n\r\nsee  how they work, the opportunities given to  them\r\n\r\nto  rest  and  play, and also the remuneration  they\r\n\r\nreceive for their employment. By and large, I should\r\n\r\nsay,  shopkeepers do keep a large  number  of  their\r\n\r\nshop assistants contented. But there is a section of\r\n\r\nemployers, by whatever name we may define them,  who\r\n\r\nare  really  slave-drivers, and  they  extract  from\r\n\r\ntheir  employees the fullest amount of work  that  a\r\n\r\nhuman  being  can afford to give without  injury  to\r\n\r\nhealth.  It is within my knowledge, Sir,  that  some\r\n\r\nshop  assistants wake up as early as six o'clock  in\r\n\r\nthe morning and they start working and they are kept\r\n\r\nworking until about eleven or twelve o'clock in  the\r\n\r\nnight. I believe, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat this sort of treatment is not the best that  we\r\n\r\ncan  accord to a fellow human being. I believe  that\r\n\r\nno  one  inside this Assembly House or outside  this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  disagree with me when I say  that  shop\r\n\r\nassistants are not machines. They are just like  you\r\n\r\nand  me.  They  must work for their  living,  but  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  also  that they should be given  sufficient\r\n\r\ntime  to  relax and sufficient time to recoup  their\r\n\r\nlost energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the clerks, generally speaking, is not\r\n\r\nas  bad as that of the shop assistants, except  that\r\n\r\nthere are proprietors who will make a clerk do  more\r\n\r\nthan  his  fair share of work. In quite a number  of\r\n\r\ninstances, I know that clerks do carry home a lot of\r\n\r\nwork  to do. Sometimes they have to carry on working\r\n\r\nin the shop itself until very late at night. Most of\r\n\r\nthem  are accounts clerks and correspondence clerks.\r\n\r\nAs  to ventilation and place of work, you will  find\r\n\r\nthat the shop assistants usually work either in  the\r\n\r\nfront  of  the  shop  or  in the  backyard.  Clerks,\r\n\r\nhowever,  are  usually given a desk in  one  obscure\r\n\r\ncorner  that  is least useful to business.  In  that\r\n\r\nsort  of a place, you will usually find insufficient\r\n\r\nlighting  and  ventilation. Perhaps a few  of  these\r\n\r\nemployers try to improve those conditions and put in\r\n\r\na dingy lamp or a little fan, but this will not help\r\n\r\nto cool the place or change the air sufficiently for\r\n\r\nthe  clerks to work in healthy surroundings. I  need\r\n\r\nnot  say it too often, but I know that it is  within\r\n\r\nyour  knowledge that clerks and shop  employees  are\r\n\r\nnot  having an easy life. They are employed in small\r\n\r\nnumbers.  One shop may probably employ two or  three\r\n\r\nshop  assistants.  Some may  even  employ  just  one\r\n\r\nassistant  and  because the shop assistants  are  so\r\n\r\ndisunited and because it is so hard for them to  get\r\n\r\ntogether,   it  is  difficult  for  them   to   make\r\n\r\njustifiable   demands - demands  for  better   working\r\n\r\nconditions or better wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore the duty of every Assemblyman here\r\n\r\nto   help   them  to  get  a  square  deal   through\r\n\r\nlegislation.  I  have come into  contact  with  many\r\n\r\nemployers.  In fact, some employers have written  to\r\n\r\nme.  I am very happy to say that the employers today\r\n\r\nare  not  the employers of yesterday. Most  of  them\r\n\r\nagree that more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfavourable conditions should be established. Many of\r\n\r\nthem  have  gone through my Bill, and,  after  that,\r\n\r\nhave  written to me saying that it is in  line  with\r\n\r\nwhat they would like to see done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, aims at giving every shop and\r\n\r\nclerical  employee  a total of fourteen  consecutive\r\n\r\npaid  holidays  for  one year's  work.  This  is  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the weekly holidays.  There  might  be\r\n\r\ncases,  Sir, where an employer may want to employ  a\r\n\r\nclerk  for  eleven months and, after that,  dispense\r\n\r\nwith  his services. In this Bill, Sir, we have  made\r\n\r\nprovision  that,  if that should be  the  case,  the\r\n\r\nemployee  will still be entitled to one  day's  paid\r\n\r\nholiday for every month of service he has given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important part of the Bill, Sir, aims at\r\n\r\ngiving  maximum protection to a worker in the matter\r\n\r\nof hours of work. It advocates that a shop assistant\r\n\r\ncan  only be asked to work up to a maximum of  eight\r\n\r\nhours  a  day  or forty-five hours  a  week;  for  a\r\n\r\nclerical  worker, seven hours a day  or  thirty-nine\r\n\r\nhours  a  week. Good employers have already observed\r\n\r\nthese  conditions  for a very  long  time.  This  is\r\n\r\nnothing new to people who are considerate, but  what\r\n\r\nwe  do  want here is for other employers  to  follow\r\n\r\nthat  good  lead. The case that I am  talking  about\r\n\r\napplies,  Sir,  especially to  clerical  workers.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  all  employers  and  those  who  have\r\n\r\ncontacted  me  and written to me will  support  this\r\n\r\nBill wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that we had in the past a\r\n\r\nmeasure  called the Weekly Holidays Ordinance.  When\r\n\r\nit  was  enforced,  proprietors  feared  that  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses would be adversely affected. They thought\r\n\r\nprobably  they  would  lose  one-seventh  of   their\r\n\r\nbusiness  in a week. However, when that Bill  became\r\n\r\nlaw,  businessmen  soon discovered  that  they  were\r\n\r\ncontinuing to do the same volume of business in  six\r\n\r\ndays   instead   of  seven.  Even  many   of   those\r\n\r\nproprietors who can keep their shops open for  seven\r\n\r\ndays  a  week are also following that lead and  they\r\n\r\nset  aside  one  day  as a holiday.  In  fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncustomers  are already aware that Sunday is  a  rest\r\n\r\nday  and  they do their buying during the other  six\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, today we find our shops opening\r\n\r\nfrom six o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock\r\n\r\nat night. We find that the shop assistants will have\r\n\r\nto wake up early, attend to the customers during the\r\n\r\nfirst  few  rush hours up to about ten o'clock,  and\r\n\r\nafter that, we find that they are just made to  hang\r\n\r\naround the shop doing nothing but wait for the  next\r\n\r\nrush  period  at one o'clock. Thereafter,  there  is\r\n\r\nanother  lax period, and another wait for  the  next\r\n\r\nrush  period. Later on in the night, you  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  the shop is open to a few stragglers who  will\r\n\r\ncome to buy their goods at the latest hour possible.\r\n\r\nIf   this  Bill  should  become  law,  Sir,  and  if\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  can regulate their hours and  make  the\r\n\r\nworkers work in shifts, I envisage that business can\r\n\r\nprobably  start at about eight o'clock  and  end  at\r\n\r\nabout  six  o'clock in the evening.  This  will  not\r\n\r\nadversely affect business. I believe the result will\r\n\r\nbe  the same as that achieved by the Weekly Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and that people will learn to  buy  their\r\n\r\nthings early before the shop closes. Instead of  the\r\n\r\nshop  waiting for the customer, it will be the  case\r\n\r\nof the customer knowing when to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to another very important part of the\r\n\r\nBill  which affects wages. Now, we may have a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of workers doing the same type of work but in\r\n\r\ndifferent shops. Some of the workers are paid  more.\r\n\r\nSome of them are paid less. Some are paid even lower\r\n\r\nthan  what  they should get. Now there  is  a  great\r\n\r\ndifference of pay and many workers are dissatisfied,\r\n\r\nbut  the  present set-up is such that  if  they  are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with their pay, the  only  alternative\r\n\r\nthey have is to resign from their jobs. We know,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  that this weapon cannot be used by many  of\r\n\r\nthe  shop assistants and therefore legislation  must\r\n\r\nbe  brought about to help them. We would like,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  see  that a worker be paid a minimum  wage.  The\r\n\r\nminimum wage is not to be determined by the employer\r\n\r\nor  the  employee. We believe, Sir, that  there  are\r\n\r\nmany people in this world who have a conscience, and\r\n\r\nwe  believe that, if one side will give to the other\r\n\r\nside  what it hopes the other side will give to  it,\r\n\r\nthen  this world will be a better world. We  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  workers' best solution  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir demands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmet  is the strike weapon. We believe that the  best\r\n\r\nweapon should be negotiation. We believe that if the\r\n\r\nworkers  can band themselves together, say, a  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of  workers  in  one  whole  street  banding\r\n\r\nthemselves  together  and  negotiating  with   their\r\n\r\nemployers, come to an agreement among themselves and\r\n\r\nthen bring their case to the Labour Department, much\r\n\r\nwaste  of  time and dissatisfaction will be avoided.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  am  talking about how  they  arrive  at  a\r\n\r\nminimum  wage. They arrive at that minimum  wage  by\r\n\r\nnegotiation  first and after that have it  confirmed\r\n\r\nwith the Ministry of Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about minimum wage, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nthis  House to know that there are many in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  would  want  to make the workers  misunderstand\r\n\r\nwhat  is actually a minimum wage. They are, in fact,\r\n\r\nspreading  rumours  round - and they  are  mischievous\r\n\r\nrumours  too - that the minimum wage is  actually  the\r\n\r\nhighest  wage they should get, or they will get,  if\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  goes through. I know that  we,  who  are\r\n\r\nsitting  here  in  this Assembly,  know  what  is  a\r\n\r\nminimum  wage but I would like the workers at  large\r\n\r\nto  know that if we fix a minimum wage of say  $150,\r\n\r\nthen  an employer cannot pay a worker less than that\r\n\r\nsum but may pay him, say, a sum like $200 or $250 or\r\n\r\nanything  that is higher. I say this, Sir,  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  many people outside this  Assembly  who\r\n\r\ncannot understand what is a minimum wage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, the provision is centred on co-operation between worker and employer, but in many\r\n\r\ncases  there  may  not  be full  agreement  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject  and things may come to a deadlock. In  this\r\n\r\ncase,  Sir,  we  have the Tribunal coming  into  the\r\n\r\npicture  where both sides are represented  by  equal\r\n\r\nnumbers  and  another  equal number  of  independent\r\n\r\npeople  sitting on that Tribunal to  find  out  what\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  most  equitable  wage.  Once   that\r\n\r\ndetermination is reached and signed by the Minister,\r\n\r\nit  will then be fixed. However, Sir, in many cases,\r\n\r\nwe  do  find that determinations, whether  they  are\r\n\r\narrived at by negotiation or by the findings of  the\r\n\r\nTribunal, leave things that are much to be  desired.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, one side of it is discontented,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  we do not feel that it is good to tie any party\r\n\r\ndown.  Hence,  provision is also made in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthat  a  determination can also be revoked  if  both\r\n\r\nsides  agree  to it, or if one side is dissatisfied,\r\n\r\nbut  if they revoke it and it comes to the Tribunal,\r\n\r\nthen the Tribunal will fix\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a matter of wage disputes, we do find that we\r\n\r\nhave  a  big  class  of people  whom  we  call  shop\r\n\r\nassistants but we must also understand that although\r\n\r\nthere  are shops in the city and shops in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas doing the same type of business, yet one  type\r\n\r\nmay  be doing better business, having a busier time,\r\n\r\nand  the  other  type  may not  be  as  busy  or  as\r\n\r\nprosperous. Therefore, to draw a hard line and  make\r\n\r\nthis  determination binding on all classes of people\r\n\r\nor on all shops is not quite right. In this Bill, we\r\n\r\nhave  made provision that a small area may be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account or a certain type of business  may  be\r\n\r\nclassified   together  for  such  purposes   for   a\r\n\r\ndetermination to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of this Bill - clause 4 - is also\r\n\r\nimportant.  This clause provides that all  employees\r\n\r\nwho  are  employed  on contract or agreement  before\r\n\r\nthis Bill becomes law, and whose terms are even more\r\n\r\nfavourable  than those provided for,  shall  not  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  such  benefits but shall  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy such advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my intention, Sir, that this Bill should be\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Select Committee of the House  before\r\n\r\nit  comes up for the Third Reading. Contrary to  the\r\n\r\nopinion  expressed by some Members in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nthat  we  have the cooperation of the Government  in\r\n\r\ndrafting  this Bill, we say, \"No, we have done  this\r\n\r\nall  on  our  own. We have done our  best.\"  But  we\r\n\r\nbelieve,   Sir,  that  this  Bill  can  be   further\r\n\r\nimproved. We know that there are many people  inside\r\n\r\nthis Assembly as well as outside it who can give  us\r\n\r\nvaluable assistance. We do not say that what we  say\r\n\r\nmust  be  right, but we say, \"We will take  what  is\r\n\r\nbest  from  everybody and incorporate what  is  most\r\n\r\npracticable and what is most useful for the  workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.\"  I have noted, too,  that  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper  No. Cmd. 11 of 1956 has been published giving\r\n\r\nthe Government's version of what the Shop and Office\r\n\r\nEmployees Bill should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike.  I  feel,  Sir, that if this  Bill  goes  into\r\n\r\nCommittee, the good ideas that are in this Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper No. Cmd. 11 may also be incorporated into this\r\n\r\nBill.  Further, Sir, before I conclude, I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  we are grateful to the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nfor  expressing his intention to co-operate with  us\r\n\r\non  this Bill when I move it for the assent of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rousing\r\n\r\ncry  of  the Member for Serangoon for social justice\r\n\r\nfor  clerical  workers  and shop  assistants  is,  I\r\n\r\nrespectfully  submit, an echo of what  I  have  been\r\n\r\nsaying  for  years  and  years  in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil and is an echo of what I have been saying in\r\n\r\nthe  trade union field and of what I have said since\r\n\r\nI became the Minister for Labour and Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved the Second Reading of the Labour\r\n\r\nBill,  now the Labour Ordinance, 1955, at  our  June\r\n\r\nmeeting last year, I did make mention that I had not\r\n\r\nlost   sight   of,  and  would  introduce,   further\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  ensure  that  shop  assistants  and\r\n\r\nclerical   workers  should  also   be   given   fair\r\n\r\nconditions of employment. Even in the discussions in\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee on the Labour  Bill,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nreiterated  my intention to introduce  such  further\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our October sitting last year, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon sought leave to  introduce  a\r\n\r\nBill governing the conditions of employment and  the\r\n\r\nrights   and   privileges  of  clerical   and   shop\r\n\r\nassistants,  I drew the attention of this  House  to\r\n\r\nthe reasons for the delay in introducing my proposed\r\n\r\nBill. I said that I was awaiting the passage of  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Bill  which  was  committed  to  a   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  that  I  had  been  confronted  with\r\n\r\ndifficulties  over  the  scope  and  extent  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  legislation. However, Sir,  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister at that sitting said, inter alia, and\r\n\r\nI quote from column 815 of the Official Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...I am so happy to see hon. Members opposite taking\r\n\r\ntheir responsibilities seriously that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  support this motion and will permit this  Bill\r\n\r\nto be placed before the House; and I trust that when\r\n\r\nwe  produce  our  own,  we will  co-operate  on  the\r\n\r\nultimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill to be discussed by this Assembly. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill was introduced by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  last  November, and when  printed  copies\r\n\r\nwere  available, I made a very careful  and  lengthy\r\n\r\nstudy  of it and I have come to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nthe provisions in the Bill are not practicable under\r\n\r\nlocal conditions. However, Sir, as the principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill is to give legislative protection to  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  and clerical workers - which principle  is\r\n\r\nin  line  with the Labour policy of the Government - I\r\n\r\nwill  not  oppose the Second Reading, especially  as\r\n\r\nthe mover has stated in his speech just now that  it\r\n\r\nis  his  intention to co-operate with the Government\r\n\r\nwhen the Bill is referred to a Select Committee  and\r\n\r\nto co-operate on the ultimate results. But I do wish\r\n\r\nto stress, Sir, that other than the principle of the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Government cannot accept the  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained therein, which, I repeat, in my view,  are\r\n\r\nimpracticable under local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Sir, to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthis  House to Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 11 of  1956.\r\n\r\nThis  lays  down the Labour policy of the Government\r\n\r\nand  includes,  as  an annexure,  a  draft  Bill  to\r\n\r\nregulate the conditions of employment of clerks  and\r\n\r\nshop   assistants.  This  Bill   would   have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced  by me in this Assembly had it  not  been\r\n\r\nfor  Government support of the motion of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon when he sought permission to introduce\r\n\r\nhis  Bill, which is now receiving its Second Reading\r\n\r\ntoday.  Referring  to Cmd. Paper No.  11.  Sir,  and\r\n\r\narising  out  of the remark made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) yesterday in the debate\r\n\r\non multi-lingualism, may I draw his attention to the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Bill, which is an annexure  to  this\r\n\r\nReport  and  which  he has been preaching  with  all\r\n\r\nenthusiasm, is a Government Bill and not the Bill of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now, Sir, make a comparison on general\r\n\r\nlines  between the Bill of the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nand  the annexure to Cmd. Paper No. 11, and for ease\r\n\r\nof  comparison in my speech I will name them as  the\r\n\r\nMember's Bill and the Government's Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, the Liberal-Socialist Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Government's Bill, Sir, is\r\n\r\nbased on the Labour Ordinance which, although it has\r\n\r\nbeen recently consolidated and amended, has been  in\r\n\r\nforce  for  many  years. The Labour  Department  has\r\n\r\ntherefore considerable experience of the problems of\r\n\r\nadministering this type of legislation. Considerable\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   the  Labour  Department   will   be\r\n\r\nnecessary,  but this is inevitable if a  department,\r\n\r\nwhich  has previously looked after the interests  of\r\n\r\nonly  one section of the working population, is  now\r\n\r\nto  extend its activities to cover almost the entire\r\n\r\nworking  population. The Member for Serangoon,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  his speech just now said that he did not discuss\r\n\r\nthe drafting of his Bill with the Government. He did\r\n\r\nit  all  on  his  own. May I respectfully  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of this House, Sir, to the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nMember's  Bill  is taken from the  Ceylon  Shop  and\r\n\r\nOffice   Employees  Regulation  of  Employment   and\r\n\r\nRemuneration  Act, 1954? It contains 38  clauses  as\r\n\r\nagainst 72 in the Ceylon Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Send it to Sir John Kotelawala!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> These 38 clauses, Sir, are, in\r\n\r\nthe  main, taken word for word from the Ceylon  Act.\r\n\r\nIts provisions make it necessary for the Minister to\r\n\r\nbring  the various parts of the Ordinance into force\r\n\r\nby Order, and every such Order must be approved by a\r\n\r\nresolution  of  the  Legislative  Assembly.  It   is\r\n\r\ncertain,  Sir, that the Minister will be  subject  to\r\n\r\ncontinuous pressure until Orders have been  made  to\r\n\r\ncover  all  shops and all offices in  all  areas  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and it therefore seems simpler  to  apply\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of such a Bill to all shops and  all\r\n\r\noffices  in  the first place, as in the Government's Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, Sir, the Government's Bill regulates\r\n\r\ncontracts  of  service,  lays  down  conditions   of\r\n\r\npayment  of  wages and limits the type of deductions\r\n\r\nwhich  may be made from wages. None of these  points\r\n\r\nis  covered in the Member's Bill, and in the case of\r\n\r\nshop  assistants  at  least,  who  are  seldom  paid\r\n\r\nregularly and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   full,  they  are  very,  very  necessary.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Bill provides for paid holidays,  paid\r\n\r\nannual  leave,  paid sick leave and overtime  rates,\r\n\r\nand  fixes  the  number of hours of  work  per  week\r\n\r\nbeyond  which  overtime must be paid.  The  Member's\r\n\r\nBill  provides for regulations to be made  regarding\r\n\r\novertime  but  does  not  provide  for  paid  public\r\n\r\nholidays or paid sick leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Bills, Sir, prescribe certain registers to be\r\n\r\nkept by the employers and give powers of inspection.\r\n\r\nClerks  and  shop  assistants are given,  under  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Bill, the right to have  their  claims\r\n\r\nheard in the Labour Court in the same way as workmen\r\n\r\nunder  the Labour Ordinance, 1955, but no such right\r\n\r\nis  given  under the Member's Bill. The Government's\r\n\r\nBill makes it an offence for contracts of service to\r\n\r\nrestrict the right of employees to join, participate\r\n\r\nin  or  organise trade unions. No such provision  is\r\n\r\nmade in the Member's Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Bill, Sir, limits the scope of\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation of a clerk to a person  employed\r\n\r\nin  or  about the business of an office whose  wages\r\n\r\nare  not  more than $400 or such other  sum  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister may from time to time declare, but does not\r\n\r\ninclude persons employed in positions of management,\r\n\r\nor  workmen or domestic servants already covered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ordinance, 1955, or any class of persons\r\n\r\nwhich the Minister may from time to time declare not\r\n\r\nto  be classed for the purposes of the Ordinance. It\r\n\r\nalso  limits  the scope of the interpretation  of  a\r\n\r\nshop assistant to a person employed in or about  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of a shop otherwise than in an  office  or\r\n\r\nclerical  department, or in a position of management\r\n\r\nwith  the  same wage limit as a clerk. The  Member's\r\n\r\nBill, Sir, does not provide for such limitation. The\r\n\r\ninterpretation  is all-embracing. A  clerk  means  a\r\n\r\nperson  employed  in  or about the  business  of  an\r\n\r\noffice,  and  a  shop assistant is a person  who  is\r\n\r\nemployed  in or about the business of a shop.  This,\r\n\r\nin effect, means, Sir, that the manual worker, right\r\n\r\nup  to  the manager or even the managing partner  in\r\n\r\nany office or shop, will be covered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  this Bill. It also ignores the fact that a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of workmen within the meaning of the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1955, who are employed  in  offices  and\r\n\r\nshops,  are  already covered by such  an  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThis  particular aspect of the Member's  Bill,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhas  been  attacked, and attacked very strongly,  by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Employers Federation.  I  bring  this\r\n\r\nout,  Sir, because the Member for Serangoon did  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  did  receive  praise  from  employers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Those are his friends!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Government is opposed\r\n\r\nto  Part  III  of the Member's Bill and  will  seek,\r\n\r\nthrough  its Members on the Select Committee  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed,  to have this Part rejected. I  will  now\r\n\r\nexplain  the  Government's objection. This  Part  is\r\n\r\nconcerned with the regulation of remuneration.  This\r\n\r\nagain is done by order of the Minister. In the first\r\n\r\nplace,  it  directs the Commissioner for  Labour  to\r\n\r\nendeavour   to   determine  the  minimum   rate   of\r\n\r\nremuneration. The determination of the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  Labour shall not be made applicable to any shop\r\n\r\nor  office unless the consent of the employer and of\r\n\r\nthe  employee  has  been obtained.  The  chances  of\r\n\r\nagreement seem slight. It is therefore, Sir, on  the\r\n\r\nRemuneration  Tribunal, to which  the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nrefer any case when the Commissioner for Labour  has\r\n\r\nnot  been able to make a determination with  consent\r\n\r\nthat most of the work of regulating wages will fall.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal makes the draft determination which  is\r\n\r\npublished in the Gazette and objection may  be  made\r\n\r\nin  writing to any determination. The Tribunal  then\r\n\r\nconfirms with or without amendment its determination\r\n\r\nwhich, once it receives the Minister's approval,  is\r\n\r\npublished  in the Gazette, and then it  comes  into\r\n\r\nforce.  There is little doubt that there will  be  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  applications from unorganised  workers  for\r\n\r\ndeterminations to be made regulating wages in  shops\r\n\r\nand  offices, and it will certainly take  years  and\r\n\r\nyears before all can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsettled  and  decided.  In  the  case  of  organised\r\n\r\nworkers,  however, the trade unions  will  certainly\r\n\r\nprefer  to  seek improved wages through negotiations\r\n\r\nas a more effective and a more satisfying method. It\r\n\r\nseems preferable, Sir, to wait for the Report of the\r\n\r\nCommission  on  the Minimum Standards of  Livelihood\r\n\r\nrather  than  to start regulating wages for  certain\r\n\r\ngroups  in a piecemeal fashion such as this. In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  Sir,  the Remuneration Tribunal seems  to  be\r\n\r\nsimilar to a Wages Council which can be set up under\r\n\r\nthe  Wages  Councils  Ordinance,  1953.  Under  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance, a Wages Council can be appointed for  any\r\n\r\nclass  of  shops  or  offices in  which  it  may  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  that it is desirable to  regulate  wages\r\n\r\nand conditions of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Member's Bill, Sir, provides for\r\n\r\nclosing  orders which may be made by  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nSuch  orders  are  going to  be  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nenforce owing to the construction of Singapore shops\r\n\r\nwhich  are  often dwelling homes and  owing  to  the\r\n\r\nhabits of the public. A large inspectorate would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  this purpose and this would  involve\r\n\r\nGovernment in much expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still evasion of the Weekly Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1949, referred to just now by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon, in spite of frequent checks  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour   inspectorate.  An  enforcement  of  closing\r\n\r\norders  would be still more difficult to carry  out.\r\n\r\nThis Part of the Bill, Sir, is just an expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe  method  of  application of the Weekly  Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's Bill, which gives shop assistants\r\n\r\nand  office  workers a civil right to overtime,  has\r\n\r\nthe  virtue of simplicity. Enforcement of this  Part\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill will, in most cases, be done  by  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  and  clerks themselves by  laying  their\r\n\r\ncomplaints  before  the Labour  Court.  Although  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the staff of the Labour Court  will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary, the Government's Bill would be much  less\r\n\r\ncostly  to  enforce than that of the Member's  Bill,\r\n\r\napart   from   another  important  factor   of   the\r\n\r\npracticability of enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to adopt legislation from another country\r\n\r\nwithout  conducting enquiries regarding its efficacy\r\n\r\nthere  would  be the highest folly. Ceylon  has  had\r\n\r\nlegislation  providing for closing orders  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  before the 1954 Act, and in his  1950  Report\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour in Ceylon  stated  that\r\n\r\nthere was an almost complete lack of co-operation on\r\n\r\nthe  part of shop employees who feared reprisals  by\r\n\r\nemployers and that shop legislation was regarded  as\r\n\r\nnuisance legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have written to the Ceylon Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and we have received his reply  to  our\r\n\r\nquestionnaire,  and this reply, Sir, strengthens  my\r\n\r\nview  that the provisions of the Member's  Bill  are\r\n\r\nnot practicable under local conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister for  Labour  for  having\r\n\r\ncorrected  a  political mistake  made  by  his  hon.\r\n\r\nLeader.  Some  months ago, his hon.  Leader  decided\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be a good thing if  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nstarted to help them to govern, and he welcomed with\r\n\r\nopen  arms the possibility of having legislation  of\r\n\r\nthis nature introduced by the Opposition. I hope the\r\n\r\nOpposition today has learnt that its job is  not  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  legislation of this nature which  only  a\r\n\r\ngovernment with the apparatus of state is  competent\r\n\r\nto  formulate, and that it should confine itself  to\r\n\r\nconstructive criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

All that I can remember  in\r\n\r\ntwo  long  days is nothing but destructive criticism\r\n\r\nwith nothing constructive at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are dealing with the conditions of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of a humble, loyal and timid section  of\r\n\r\nthe  population - a  section  that  has  never  pushed\r\n\r\nitself  upon the public and that would take what  is\r\n\r\ngiven - and  it  is therefore all the  more  necessary\r\n\r\nthat there should, in all sincerity, be genuine  co-operation  in this matter. When Government  received\r\n\r\nthe Bill, Sir, perhaps you will remember - I think  it\r\n\r\nwas   in  November  last - that  in  happily  granting\r\n\r\nconsent  for the motion of the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nto  introduce  this  Bill, I  did  indicate  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly that Government had on the stocks a similar\r\n\r\nBill  and that we would appreciate co-operation  with\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having studied the Member's Bill, we\r\n\r\nbelieve - and this is not because it has been borrowed\r\n\r\nfrom  a  neighbouring territory, because  we  freely\r\n\r\nconfess  that ours is a compendium wherein  we  also\r\n\r\nborrow     from    a    number    of    Commonwealth\r\n\r\nterritories - from  the  experience  of   the   Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment,  that the Bill submitted  to  you  under\r\n\r\nthis  White  Paper  in  one that  better  meets  the\r\n\r\nconditions  in this country. The Bill introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon, as has been pointed  out,\r\n\r\nis  only  part of the Ceylon Act. It does not  cover\r\n\r\nthe  field  if one would only look at the number  of\r\n\r\nparts covered by the Government Bill; but I rise  to\r\n\r\nsay  this, Sir, that, in the normal course, it would\r\n\r\nhave  been the duty of Government to oppose the Bill\r\n\r\nbecause  of  its very grave inadequacies.  We  would\r\n\r\nhave  done  so,  Sir,  but for  this  fact - that  our\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders provide that if a Bill is rejected,\r\n\r\nno  Bill  of a similar character embodying the  same\r\n\r\nprinciple  may  be introduced in the  Assembly,  not\r\n\r\nmerely  during that sitting but during that session,\r\n\r\nso  that if we were to reject this Bill we would  be\r\n\r\nin  the unhappy position of having to wait until the\r\n\r\nnext  session, if any, because you are  aware,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  life of this Government and the existence\r\n\r\nof  parliamentary democracy is in the  balance  next\r\n\r\nMay, and we would not wish to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndelay and perhaps defer indefinitely. So we are,  as\r\n\r\na  Government, with a whiff of life supporting  this\r\n\r\nBill but I do not wish the House to be misled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the mover of this Bill, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon, is content to send  it  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee and to take into consideration  the\r\n\r\nGovernment White Paper, which is an excellent  idea.\r\n\r\nBut  I trust that it is clearly understood that,  on\r\n\r\nthe  Third Reading, if any matter passes through the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee which is not acceptable to us,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is free to take up the issue as though it\r\n\r\nis   on   the  Second  Reading.  It  is  an  unusual\r\n\r\nprocedure, Sir, but it is permissible, and in  order\r\n\r\nnot to mislead this Assembly I rise to make it clear\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  happy  to  support  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon because we want, as I know he wants, early\r\n\r\nlegislation  controlling the  living  conditions  of\r\n\r\nthese humble workers. The details, I am hopeful,  in\r\n\r\nfact  I  believe, can be amicably worked out in  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, particularly if my hon. Friend the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon is a Member, where matters  can\r\n\r\nbe   explained   in   detail   by   the   respective\r\n\r\nprofessional  officials. It may well be  that  there\r\n\r\nwill be no trouble with the Bill, but I think it  is\r\n\r\nright  that it should be understood that our support\r\n\r\nat   this   juncture  does  not  preclude  us   from\r\n\r\ncriticising  any  aspects at a later  stage,  if  we\r\n\r\nconsider necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I have no\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  the  principle of having  a  Bill  to\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of office and shop workers,  I\r\n\r\nshall  be  doing a great disservice to a very  large\r\n\r\nnumber of my electorate if I do not remind the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember, who moved this motion, that he has forgotten\r\n\r\na  very  large  number  of workers  in  the  Service\r\n\r\ndepartments in Singapore. It is a retrograde step to\r\n\r\nhave omitted them in the hon.

Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  should  point this  out  because  the  new\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist Party has some supporters  in  the\r\n\r\nService departments and it is for me now to champion\r\n\r\ntheir  cause  by  pointing  out  to  the  mover  his\r\n\r\nomission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that the Select Committee would be\r\n\r\nwasting  a lot of time if the Bill, as presented  by\r\n\r\nthe hon.

At\r\n\r\nthe   same  time,  I  am  very  surprised   at   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's agreement to send this Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, because the Hon. the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand   Welfare  himself  has  opposed  many  of   the\r\n\r\nprinciples in this Bill. I cannot find the logic  of\r\n\r\nhis  agreement  for this Bill to be  referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. I think the hon. Member's Bill  is\r\n\r\nbeyond  repair and although I feel that there should\r\n\r\nbe  some  sort of legislation along these  lines,  I\r\n\r\nshall  not  vote for it to be referred to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee because there are many things involved  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill which we will never be able to  do  in  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  We  should  have  another   Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced in the way that we want and in detail, so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  be able to sit around and  talk  the\r\n\r\nmatter  over.  I do not regard this  Bill,  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nserving  any useful purpose by having it  considered\r\n\r\nin  a  Select Committee, and I do say this with  all\r\n\r\nhonesty and sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

I would like to inform the House, Sir, that\r\n\r\nbefore this Bill was prepared, a public meeting  was\r\n\r\nheld  in  the Badminton Hall and we invited everyone\r\n\r\nwho  felt that he wanted to improve the lot  of  the\r\n\r\nshop  assistants  or the clerks to that  meeting  to\r\n\r\nmake  his  contribution. We have  proposed  what  we\r\n\r\nthink should be the minimum that would be asked  for\r\n\r\nthe  clerks  and the shop assistants.  We  are  only\r\n\r\nmaking a start with this Bill. We do not say that it\r\n\r\nwill  cover  everything but the minimum requirements\r\n\r\nthat  we propose therein were passed unanimously  at\r\n\r\nthat  meeting. That does show some support  for  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one of the Members here did say that it is a\r\n\r\nmistake  for the Opposition to put up such  a  Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  we  should not co-operate with the Government,\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  should keep on criticising it. We  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  such views. We believe that  we  should\r\n\r\nonly  criticise  Government if  they  go  wrong.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  if  we  can make a  contribution,  we\r\n\r\nshould make that contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are aware, Sir, that we have not the machinery\r\n\r\nat   our   command   to  make  all   this   detailed\r\n\r\nlegislation, but we have done our very best. We  did\r\n\r\nnot  claim,  at the Second Reading, that  it  was  a\r\n\r\nperfect  Bill,  but that it could be  made  perfect.\r\n\r\nThat  was the reason why it should be referred to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world there are people who have gone\r\n\r\nbefore us. They are wiser and they have expressed  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of views. I believe, Sir, if  you  look\r\n\r\nthrough all the Bills in this House - every Bill - you\r\n\r\nwill  see that there is not one that can be said  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  originally drafted by the Government.  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  these Bills have sometimes been  borrowed\r\n\r\nfrom  England,  sometimes from India, and  sometimes\r\n\r\nfrom Australia or somewhere else. We should not  say\r\n\r\nthat  a private Member has copied from certain other\r\n\r\nBills  because  we are now and have been  all  these\r\n\r\nyears doing that very same thing. Sir, we must  copy\r\n\r\nwhat is best in this world and leave out what is not\r\n\r\ngood. In Ceylon, you say that there is an Act  of  a\r\n\r\nsimilar nature running into something like 70 to  80\r\n\r\nsections,  and covering many aspects of legislation.\r\n\r\nToday,  Sir,  we present a very short Bill.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen told that it falls far short of requirements. I\r\n\r\nhave  been told that the Ceylon Act is not workable.\r\n\r\nSir,  as I say, we are only making a start.  We  may\r\n\r\nstill  find a lot of mistakes that will have  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrected. This Bill will have to be further amended\r\n\r\neven  if it should become law, just like any of  our\r\n\r\nold Bills. Many amendments may have to be made later\r\n\r\nto make it suit local conditions as the days go by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out to me by the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Welfare  that  the  clause\r\n\r\nrelating to wages is not as good as it should be and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Tribunal will be made to work  very  hard\r\n\r\nbecause  agreement  may not be reached  between  the\r\n\r\nshop  assistants  and  the shopkeepers,  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  he  will  be  loaded with  work.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nsubscribe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto this view, Sir. I know that many who work in this\r\n\r\nisland as shop assistants are not discontented,  and\r\n\r\nI  know  that  the  good  relationship  that  exists\r\n\r\nbetween  the  shopkeepers and their  employees  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  bring about agreement in more than seventy\r\n\r\nper  cent of the cases affected. I believe that only\r\n\r\nin a very small number of shops have we discontented\r\n\r\nemployees.  If  they were really discontented,  they\r\n\r\nwould have left the shops because there has been  no\r\n\r\nlegislation  to protect them up to now.  They  would\r\n\r\nhave  left, but they are there, and I know  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  have  been  working there for many  years - some\r\n\r\nrunning to ten years, twenty years or thirty  years.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Sir, my view is that even if  we  have  a\r\n\r\nTribunal,  that Tribunal will not be  made  to  work\r\n\r\nvery  hard.  What  it will have to  do  is  to  send\r\n\r\nagreements  to the Minister for him to sign  on  the\r\n\r\ndotted line. Probably some work will be involved  in\r\n\r\nthe signing. I do agree with that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You can buy a chop!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> That might help, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink that it is going to be a terrible problem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has hinted at another point - about closing\r\n\r\norders.  I  say that, in the same way as the  Weekly\r\n\r\nHolidays  Ordinance can be enforced, closing  orders\r\n\r\ncan  also  be  enforced, if you cannot  enforce  the\r\n\r\nWeekly Holidays Ordinance and see that the shops are\r\n\r\nclosed  on that day, then that is admitting  defeat.\r\n\r\nIf   you  say  you  can  enforce  the  law,  it   is\r\n\r\nsuccessful. If cases of people going against the law\r\n\r\nare  few  and  far  between, then you  have  made  a\r\n\r\nsuccess of it. A similar result can be achieved with\r\n\r\nthese  closing  orders. The Hon. Minister  envisages\r\n\r\nthat  the  best way would be for shop assistants  to\r\n\r\nform   themselves  into  one  big  union  and   then\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with employers who have formed themselves\r\n\r\ninto  another  big  union. Then, everything  can  be\r\n\r\nsigned, the closing order will affect everybody, and\r\n\r\neverybody will be happy. But I say that in Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  most difficult section of the workers that  can\r\n\r\nbe  persuaded  to  form a union would  be  the  shop\r\n\r\nassistants.  Similarly, the most difficult  type  of\r\n\r\ntrades where employers:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  come  together will be the shop owners.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  very  difficult  for us  to  fix  a  wage  for\r\n\r\neverybody.  I  dare say that a shop in North  Bridge\r\n\r\nRoad and one doing a similar business in Ponggol end\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  the same volume  of  business.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  in these two shops will not be working  the\r\n\r\nsame number of hours or, I should say, putting forth\r\n\r\nas  much  energy  on  one  side  as  on  the  other.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to  say  that their  wages  and  working\r\n\r\nconditions  should be the same is, I  think,  wrong.\r\n\r\nThat   is  why  we  put  into  that  Bill   a   wage\r\n\r\ndetermination which can be fixed by the employer  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand and by the employees on the other.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve that we can fix wages by regions and not  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole,  probably by streets but  certainly  not\r\n\r\naffecting the whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which has been brought up\r\n\r\nby   the  Hon.  Minister,  and  that  is  about  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  shop assistants or clerks.  Here,  I\r\n\r\nagree with him that probably a better definition can\r\n\r\ncome  by  and  by  and I would certainly  welcome  a\r\n\r\nbetter  definition  of the terms \"clerk\"  and  \"shop\r\n\r\nassistant\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  Mr  Speaker as Chairman  and  seven\r\n\r\nMembers   to  be  nominated  by  the  Committee   of\r\n\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I second it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under Standing\r\n\r\nOrder 21(6), I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it be an instruction to the Select Committee\r\n\r\non the Shop and Office Employees Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  regard be had to the terms of the  draft  Bill\r\n\r\nannexed  to  the  Government White Paper,  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper No. Cmd. 11 of 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
