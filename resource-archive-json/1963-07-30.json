That  era began in 1945 when  the  British\r\n\r\ntroops  returned to Malaya and, by a unilateral  act\r\n\r\nof  the  British Government, Singapore  was  severed\r\n\r\nfrom  the mainland. The struggle went on inside  and\r\n\r\noutside   official  bodies,  the  then   Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil both here and in the Federation, until  1948\r\n\r\nwhen the M.C.P. launched its armed revolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reached a turning point in the year 1957, August\r\n\r\n31st,  when  the  British decided  to  grant  Malaya\r\n\r\nindependence,  but  not  Singapore.  Singapore,   it\r\n\r\nseems,  was  ordained  to remain  forever  in  semi-tutelage  with  internal  self-government  but  with\r\n\r\nsupreme  authority  in matters of  defence,  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  and, for that matter, internal security  in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the British Raj.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to detail an account of the years\r\n\r\n1945  to  1948 or, even more unpleasant,  the  years\r\n\r\n1948 to 1957. Suffice it to say that this unilateral\r\n\r\ndivision  of the country was never accepted  by  the\r\n\r\npeoples  either of the Federation of  Malaya  or  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In Singapore, for the purposes  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate, the last few chapters began with 1955,  when\r\n\r\nthe  first semi-elected Assembly assumed office with\r\n\r\nelected Ministers working with British officials  in\r\n\r\ncharge of Home Affairs and Finance. Year by year  we\r\n\r\nwent  back  to London with more or less  greater  or\r\n\r\nlesser  results.  And for us, the  last  chapter  to\r\n\r\nmerger  really began with 1959. Then for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime power, other than defence, foreign affairs, and\r\n\r\ninternal security which were shared with Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe  British,  was bestowed on a completely  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the history of Singapore and indeed the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  South-East  Asia  may  well  have  been\r\n\r\ndifferent had we decided any other way. In  1959  we\r\n\r\nwere quite convinced, even before we assumed office,\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  no  other way. The  nexus  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation   was   so  complete  that   to   perform\r\n\r\ndissection  would  have  taxed  the  skill  of   the\r\n\r\ngreatest  political surgeons who ever  existed,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  there were none either in  Malaya  or  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   or,   for  that  matter,   in   Britain.\r\n\r\nSingapore,   it   was  generally   recognised,   was\r\n\r\ndependent on Malaya for many things. 40 per cent  of\r\n\r\nits  entrepot  trade, nearly three-quarters  of  its\r\n\r\nwater  supply.  And  it  was believed  that  with  a\r\n\r\nfriendly  Government  in the  Federation,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  be kept indefinitely a military base in  semi\r\n\r\nindependence. In 1956, the Member for Anson, to whom\r\n\r\nhistory  has given a few lessons  - or he  has  chosen\r\n\r\nnot to learn from them  - led an All-Party delegation.\r\n\r\nIt  failed, partly because he did not understand the\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which Singapore was placed and  the\r\n\r\ndetermination of the then British Government that it\r\n\r\nshould remain in semi-tutelage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urged the then Secretary of State for the\r\n\r\nColonies,  a  very able and forceful character,  who\r\n\r\ndecided  to  give  independence to Malaya,  that  he\r\n\r\nshould, despite the advice of his officials, tie  up\r\n\r\nSingapore  with the Federation, for  there  was  too\r\n\r\nmuch  at  stake.  As it was, the  talks  failed.  We\r\n\r\nreturned, and the British, in a completely empirical\r\n\r\nmanner,  true to their traditions, played  for  time\r\n\r\nand  played  their hand out for the last few  years,\r\n\r\nfrom  1956 to 1959. We went back each year, in 1957,\r\n\r\nto  reach agreement in principle; in 1958,  to  sort\r\n\r\nout   the  constitutional  details.  By  then,   the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies had accepted the\r\n\r\nfact that if Malaya was lost to the Communists, then\r\n\r\nSingapore could not be held. Indeed there was  every\r\n\r\ndanger  that the Communists would be more successful\r\n\r\nin  finally  capturing this area if the  territories\r\n\r\nwere  kept  apart than if the territories were  kept\r\n\r\ntogether.  But it took another two years - from  1959\r\n\r\nto  1961 - before the British were convinced  of  the\r\n\r\nnext step of the argument: that if Singapore was not\r\n\r\nin   Malaya,   then  Singapore  and   Malaya   would\r\n\r\nultimately  be lost to the Communists.  The  British\r\n\r\nhad  hoped that the Government that would come  into\r\n\r\noffice in Singapore would be satisfied with what the\r\n\r\nformer Chief Minister (the Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Anson)  described as \"the sensation of  power\",\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister, the Ministers of the Government,\r\n\r\nand even one Infantry Regiment to do it honours. But\r\n\r\nreal  power  resided  with them.  They  expected  an\r\n\r\nelected  Government, i.e. us, to  keep  their  bases\r\n\r\nviable.  In  order  to do that,  the  anti  colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle  must  be  muted and the  Communist  menace\r\n\r\ncrushed  from time to time as it manifested  itself.\r\n\r\nAnd indefinitely we went on as a semi-colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a full two years before we brought the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government  round  to  the  view  that  our\r\n\r\nconclusion  was  correct. If played that  way,  both\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaya would  be  lost.  Slowly  the\r\n\r\nunpleasant  and brutal facts were placed before  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. What had been publicly  known\r\n\r\nwas that Malaya was vital to Singapore, but what  we\r\n\r\ndid not emphasise, lest we offend our friends across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway, was that Singapore was vital to their\r\n\r\nsurvival.  Quietly  over the golf course,  sometimes\r\n\r\neven  across the poker table, and sometimes  over  a\r\n\r\nmeal, a friendly discussion always came. It had  one\r\n\r\ntheme  song: merger is inevitable, either by consent\r\n\r\nor  by force of one territory over the other. Let me\r\n\r\nsay,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, that  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  overwhelming  the  Federation  is  not  a\r\n\r\npossibility to be altogether dismissed.  Being  what\r\n\r\nwe  were,  having regard to the susceptibilities  of\r\n\r\nour friends in the Federation, the line was put over\r\n\r\nsoftly,  gently, and politely. Finally  a  note  was\r\n\r\nstruck in the hearts of the Federation Ministers. On\r\n\r\nthe  17th  of  May, the Tunku came down to  announce\r\n\r\nthat  he  had decided that there should be a  closer\r\n\r\npolitical and economic association of the Federation\r\n\r\nof   Malaya,   Singapore,  and  the   three   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of that is recent history. Suffice it to\r\n\r\nsay,  on  3rd  June I responded. On  10th  June,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Deputy Prime Minister  stated  terms\r\n\r\nwhich  were  basic and fundamental to  a  successful\r\n\r\nmerger,  terms  on  which merger could  be  achieved\r\n\r\nbetween the Federation and Singapore. Autonomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin many matters, including Labour and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the real fight began. For the first time,\r\n\r\nafter  shouting and denouncing the British  for  all\r\n\r\nthese  years since 1945, the Malayan Communist Party\r\n\r\ndid  a  right-about-turn. They denounced merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as a piece of neo-colonialism. Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether they really believed in it. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  have  shouted it for so long  that  they  have\r\n\r\nbemused  themselves into believing that it is  true.\r\n\r\nBut  today I will tell part of the story.  I  cannot\r\n\r\ntell   the  whole  story  because  sometimes  recent\r\n\r\nhistory  should  be allowed to pass without  comment\r\n\r\nfor time to mellow judgment. I know enough and I can\r\n\r\ndisclose enough of recent history to prove  that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  a  colonialist  plot.  It  took  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npersuasion and argument to bring the Tunku around to\r\n\r\nmerger.  And  he  only wanted merger with  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do not blame him. Being what he is  - anxious\r\n\r\nto  preserve what he thinks are the valuable  traits\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation, a stable rural population  that\r\n\r\nprovides security and ensures the continuance of the\r\n\r\nAlliance Party in power  - he was reluctant to  embark\r\n\r\non  a  project  the  result of which  he  could  not\r\n\r\nforesee. Without the Borneo territories, the Chinese\r\n\r\nwould outnumber the Malays and, with it, the logical\r\n\r\nconsequences of its effects on the balance of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British encouraged the Tunku to believe\r\n\r\nthat  eventually he could get the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nbecause  it was a good idea and generally it  was  a\r\n\r\ngood thing. You will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nNovember/December 1961 there was  a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\nargument  as to the future of the defence  bases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The argument was presented as  a  problem\r\n\r\nof   defence  bases.  But,  in  truth,  it  was  the\r\n\r\nreluctance   of  the  British  to  give   up   their\r\n\r\nterritories in Borneo. That was a backwater  - silent,\r\n\r\ncalm,  placid - and their rule could have endured  for\r\n\r\nanother decade or more. The Governor of Singapore  - a\r\n\r\ngentleman of no mean talent  - felt that he had served\r\n\r\nhis  penance  in Singapore, as Chief  Secretary  and\r\n\r\nthen  as Governor when he had to govern through  the\r\n\r\nthen Chief Minister. He governed. He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  not  anxious  to  upset North  Borneo  and  its\r\n\r\npeoples; neither was the Governor of Sarawak. But  I\r\n\r\ngive this compliment to the British, as I give to an\r\n\r\nadversary  whom I respect, a compliment  not  to  be\r\n\r\nlightly dismissed. Competent, capable, with a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  knowledge  of the ways  of  men,  like  an\r\n\r\nelectronic computer with an immense amount  of  data\r\n\r\nfed  in,  data  of over 400 years of  governing  and\r\n\r\nmanipulating human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two years they tried to manipulate us into\r\n\r\ndoing  what  they  thought  was  the  role  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  - keep the bases viable,  break\r\n\r\nthe  Communists up from time to time, and carry  on.\r\n\r\nFor two years we resisted. Then one day they decided\r\n\r\nthat  it just could not go on. And the fight  began.\r\n\r\nThe   greatest   ignominy  that  had  befallen   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  was  the fact that a Scottish  feudalist\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- in their terminology, I do not call him a feudalist\r\n\r\nas  I think he is extremely competent in his own way\r\n\r\nas  a representative of an Empire, persuaded a group\r\n\r\nof   highly   suspicious  and   security   conscious\r\n\r\nCommunist-front operators to come out into the open,\r\n\r\nand  the  fight began. The Communists  were  playing\r\n\r\nhide  and  seek   - for  the Government,  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, sometimes for so long as it is  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  people,  as  they  say,  sometimes\r\n\r\nagainst.  The Tunku was not contemplating merger  or\r\n\r\neven Malaysia for that matter. What he wanted was  a\r\n\r\nclean-cut decision, then he would take over security\r\n\r\nfor  both Singapore and the Borneo territories.  And\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  no  more  than security.  It  is  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of  these historic beginnings that  we  had\r\n\r\nsuch an immense amount of trouble subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Anson, we had that motion of confidence in\r\n\r\nthis  House one night, and the break was  final  and\r\n\r\nirrevocable. Then we talked business with the Tunku.\r\n\r\nThere  was no pre-arranged or pre-conceived plan  as\r\n\r\nthey  thought.  They were bemused and  deluded.  The\r\n\r\nBritish  arranged  in the midst  of  the  Anson  by-election   to   bring  their  Governors   over   for\r\n\r\nunnecessary    consultations   to    arouse    their\r\n\r\nsuspicions,  put  them in a state  of  fright.  They\r\n\r\npanicked and broke away. They came out from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bushes and made a bid for power, an action they\r\n\r\nwill  always  regret. Their policy  was  the  united\r\n\r\nfront.  If  they cannot unite with nationalists  who\r\n\r\nare  democratic socialists, who on earth could  they\r\n\r\nunite  with?  So  they have found themselves  in  an\r\n\r\nignominious  alliance  with the  Liberal-Socialists,\r\n\r\nthe United Democratic Party - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson. They even\r\n\r\ntried to inveigle the Member for Hong Lim. But there\r\n\r\nwas  no more cover. It was a bit of nylon for a  fig\r\n\r\nleaf   and   when  the  rains  came,  it  was   most\r\n\r\nembarrassing. All this was a tortuous  process,  and\r\n\r\nwhat   was   required   was   absolute   and   utter\r\n\r\ndetermination and the nerve to see it through.  Even\r\n\r\nright  now, it needs nerve to see it through to  the\r\n\r\n31st  of  August. Not me, just one man, because  one\r\n\r\nman  cannot  see this through. It needed  sufficient\r\n\r\nresolution  in the whole group of men.  I  am  proud\r\n\r\nthat it has been the privilege of my colleagues  and\r\n\r\nmyself to have played a part in this. We settled the\r\n\r\nterms.  Because  the  Tunku was  fearful  of  labour\r\n\r\ntroubles,  general unrest, instability in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  possible bankruptcy, he was anxious to have  as\r\n\r\nlittle as possible to do with us as he could. But he\r\n\r\nknew he could not afford to give away security. What\r\n\r\nhe  wanted was the police, army and foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nThe rest we can run ourselves -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Prisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, prisons. I beg your\r\n\r\npardon.  Thank  you. My colleague has just  reminded\r\n\r\nme.  The three of us - the Minister for Culture,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance and I - brought the wrath of the\r\n\r\nCommunists  on  us because we went up there,  played\r\n\r\ngolf,  talked over dinner and lunch. They  hated  us\r\n\r\nmore  than the others because we forged this  thing.\r\n\r\nWe  put  in  civil  aviation and  telecommunications\r\n\r\nbecause  we  think it makes nonsense of a federation\r\n\r\nfor  us  to have to make a trunk call every time  we\r\n\r\nwant to go to Johore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the White Paper was agreed, the basis of which\r\n\r\nwas that we should have 15 seats in Parliament. This\r\n\r\nis  a  few seats less than what we would be entitled\r\n\r\nto  in a complete merger. In return for this, we ran\r\n\r\nour  own State. Mind you, at that time, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the  general  impression  was  that  we  were\r\n\r\nbankrupt   because  there  were  strikes,   banners,\r\n\r\nprotests,  marches and a whole host of other  things\r\n\r\nwhich   made  Singapore  appear,  on  the   surface,\r\n\r\nfinancially  an  unattractive proposition.  But  all\r\n\r\nthat  time  when we were drafting that  White  Paper\r\n\r\ntogether, the Finance Minister knew that  he  had  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  each  year, calculated and designed,  meant\r\n\r\nfor development - a surplus of over $100 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the Cobbold Commission because the Tunku\r\n\r\nstood  firm  that  he  would not  go  ahead  without\r\n\r\nBorneo.  So through the months of argument,  debate,\r\n\r\nthe open encounter, which ended with the referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the moment we settled that, new problems began. For then some very unwise politicians in the M.C.A. in Kuala Lumpur thought that since all was agreed now, was passed, then they could not only eat their cake, but also have it. So you see in Paper Misc. 4 of 1963 a curious exchange\r\n\r\nof memoranda. Sir, they have to be published because\r\n\r\nat  the end of 1964 a review must take place. In our\r\n\r\ncomputations, even at its inflated best,  even  with\r\n\r\nconfrontation  and the Army and Navy and  Air  Force\r\n\r\ndoubled  and  internal  security  for  Singapore  no\r\n\r\nlonger  the responsibility of the British, but  four\r\n\r\nbattalions must be raised locally, we do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  money can be spent, nor indeed will be  spent.\r\n\r\nBecause   to  get  $1.80  from  us,  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  has to spend $8.20. So I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthey will spend it. Knowing the Finance Minister and\r\n\r\nhis colleagues, I do not think they will spend $8.20\r\n\r\njust  in  order to do us in by $1.80.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nultimate figure we have arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you will see in Document I, the first proposal\r\n\r\nby  the Federation side. Meanwhile the officials had\r\n\r\nbeen meeting. We met the Ministers for the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime on the presentation of the paper dated 21st  of\r\n\r\nMarch,  Document  I. There was the  proposal.  I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  to  have to go into this, but it is necessary\r\n\r\nto   place  this  on  the  record.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill says this is all a lot of eye-wash.  These\r\n\r\ndocuments speak for themselves. There was a proposal\r\n\r\nthat they should collect our money, contrary to  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the White Paper. They wanted  to  collect\r\n\r\nbecause  by then they had discovered that, far  from\r\n\r\nbeing  bankrupt,  we  were a prosperous  State  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, if they collected and doled and paid  for\r\n\r\nour  expenses, they would collect a surplus of  $110\r\n\r\nmillion each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Document II is our counter. We said we were\r\n\r\nprepared briefly to give them a share of Singapore's\r\n\r\nprosperity,  provided  the Federation  ensured  that\r\n\r\nSingapore prospered. And it could only prosper if it\r\n\r\nhad  a Common Market on terms which would allow over\r\n\r\na  period  of  time  an  adjustment  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy.  Any sudden cataclysmic change  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  disastrous.  That paper was  rejected  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation side in Document III. The only concession\r\n\r\nthey  made was they were still to collect, but  they\r\n\r\nwould  keep  only half the surplus. Not unnaturally,\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues and I were not greatly  impressed  or\r\n\r\ngrateful  for  such  a  suggestion.  Then  the  long\r\n\r\nwrangle - part of it on the golf course, part  of  it\r\n\r\nin the conference room, part of it over the luncheon\r\n\r\ntable.  Finally  we  got down to  calculations,  and\r\n\r\nDocuments  IV and V are projections of  revenue  and\r\n\r\nexpenditure for 1964, based on actuals for 1961  and\r\n\r\non provisional actuals for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Document VI, on 10th of June, I made a statement\r\n\r\nto  this  House.  I was convinced, and  so  were  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, that merger was inevitable.  But  I  was\r\n\r\nnot convinced that the success of the new Federation\r\n\r\nwas  inevitable, and it was our duty to ensure  that\r\n\r\nin  so  far as is humanly possible it should have  a\r\n\r\ngood  start. To plunder Singapore, which Document  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  done, would have been a  bad  start.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not have put my money on it if we had  agreed\r\n\r\nto  Document I. Because then over the years, as  the\r\n\r\npeople  realised the financial implications  of  the\r\n\r\nterms on which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe were absorbed by the Federation, bitterness would\r\n\r\nrancour  in  their hearts; and without a  successful\r\n\r\nSingapore, Malaysia could not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Document VII, Mr Speaker, Sir, is what is known in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers as \"the ultimatum\".  I  saw  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers   the   Member  for   Cairnhill   waiting\r\n\r\npatiently  outside  while the  ultimatum  was  being\r\n\r\nconsidered  inside the Cabinet room. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether he was for Singapore. But even if he was,  I\r\n\r\nwondered  whether  that was the  way  to  fight  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an extremely complex situation. If you\r\n\r\nfight too harshly and too hard, then you bring about\r\n\r\nbitterness  that is bound to endure  into  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  make  the sense of unity and purpose and  amity\r\n\r\nbetween  the peoples less likely. If you  yield  and\r\n\r\ngive way, then you will be raped and plundered,  and\r\n\r\nthat  makes  Malaysia a certain failure. So  between\r\n\r\nthe  two extremes, a balance has to be struck. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  deal  in detail  with  the  financial\r\n\r\narrangements.   My  colleague,  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance, who bore the brunt of the detailed work and\r\n\r\nthe argument with his counterpart in the Federation,\r\n\r\nwill   do  so.  If  I  know  him,  he  will  do   so\r\n\r\ncompetently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Document VIII was our reply. It is not easy, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, - no, Document IX, I am sorry, the point-by-point  reply.  Document VIII was  the  ultimatum.\r\n\r\nDocument IX was the reply. On the 22nd of June, on a\r\n\r\nSaturday, we sent a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Malaysia was a neo-colonialist plot, all this\r\n\r\nwould  have  been unnecessary. The British  had  the\r\n\r\npower  constitutionally and in actual fact to  bring\r\n\r\nthis  about.  But  I think they  were  wise  in  not\r\n\r\nexercising  that power. They allowed free  and  open\r\n\r\nnegotiations leading to a voluntary and satisfactory\r\n\r\nconclusion. If Malaysia was a neo-colonialist  plot,\r\n\r\ntoday  Brunei would be in Malaysia. For  the  Sultan\r\n\r\nexists  and  survives by leave and  licence  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Army.  But they are also sufficiently  wise\r\n\r\nand  prudent  to understand that the ruler  has  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the large bulk of his people, sufficient\r\n\r\nfor even Azahari to treat him with some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect to leave well alone. But I am quite sure too\r\n\r\nthat  the gradual process of attrition, the wearing-down process of argument day in day out will finally\r\n\r\nensure  that  fair  and just terms  are  agreed  and\r\n\r\nendorsed by the peoples of Malaya and Brunei.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  unhopeful of the future. I have read  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen said in the papers, and sometimes I think it is\r\n\r\nwiser   not  to  say  some  of  these  things.   But\r\n\r\nnevertheless, I think the Sultan was deeply hurt  by\r\n\r\nmany  things that happened in Kuala Lumpur. I  think\r\n\r\nalso  some  of  the Federation Ministers,  in  their\r\n\r\nstate of anxiety, were unnecessarily severe in their\r\n\r\nexpressions to the Sultan. I am also convinced  that\r\n\r\nthis  electronic computor which has  learnt  how  to\r\n\r\nhandle  chieftains, revolutionaries and revolts  and\r\n\r\nmutinies over 400 years, even though getting  a  bit\r\n\r\nold  and  not quite as good as it used to  be,  will\r\n\r\nbring  its  whole  force  to  bear  on  this  little\r\n\r\nsultanate  and eventually Malaysia will  triumph  by\r\n\r\nreason,  by argument, by logic, and not by force.  I\r\n\r\ncan pay no better tribute to them than the fact that\r\n\r\nin  the  last round they really beat us  in  London.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  had them, as the expression goes,  by  the\r\n\r\nneck. We had settled with the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> By\r\n\r\nthe throat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sorry. By the throat. We had\r\n\r\nsettled with the Federation. We had not settled with\r\n\r\nthe  British.  We  had put in our claims.  All  W.D.\r\n\r\nlands  with  no  title to be returned  forthwith  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Consternation,   Mr   Speaker,    Sir.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile  the Secretary of State had joined  forces\r\n\r\nwith the Federation to coerce us into getting us  to\r\n\r\ncough up for Borneo. Finally, $100 million, interest\r\n\r\nfree  for  5  years. Originally,  it  was  almost  a\r\n\r\nhundred  per  cent  labour, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  All\r\n\r\nlabour which cannot be found in Borneo must be taken\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore.  The Tunku intervened.  But  before\r\n\r\nthat,  the  moment  it  looked  like  settling,   we\r\n\r\npresented  the  claims. Then the British  said  they\r\n\r\nwould cough up the lands. But only part of it. So we\r\n\r\nsaid  $20  million must be paid as compensation  for\r\n\r\nlands  which are retained. I am quite sure  that  if\r\n\r\nonly we had waited another 24 to 48 hours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe would have got the money. But for various reasons\r\n\r\nthe Tunku believed that 8th July was a lucky day  by\r\n\r\nthe stars. The British knew this and they worked  on\r\n\r\nhim because they could not work on us and get us  to\r\n\r\ngive  way.  We lost because the Tunku said  we  must\r\n\r\nsign  on  that  night and so the  signing  began  at\r\n\r\nquarter  to  twelve on the 8th of July. I  think  it\r\n\r\nended about 12.10 in the morning of the 9th of July.\r\n\r\nAnd we had to give up. From $15 million we agreed to\r\n\r\n$10 million. Was this a neo-colonialist plot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic factors were there, and the moment the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Commission here drew the Communists  out  into\r\n\r\nthe  open, their days were doomed. They allowed  the\r\n\r\nfight  to  go on. In the last resort the  gun  would\r\n\r\nhave to be used, but they left it alone. Very wisely\r\n\r\ntoo.  They made a decision in 1957, when the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill was the Chief Minister, and again  in\r\n\r\n1958 - he did not make the decision; the Governor did - that  the P.A.P. shall go on. The then Director  of\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch, when he saw the way  the  elections\r\n\r\nwere going in 1959, decided to hop it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What does that mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That means scoot! If they had\r\n\r\ntheir way, they would have done the stupid thing, as\r\n\r\nthey   always  do,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  They  never\r\n\r\ncalculate.  They always play poker, as  I  often  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member for Cairnhill and with the  Tunku,\r\n\r\njust to pass the time of day in order to get one  or\r\n\r\ntwo odd points in. I always lose. I never win. I  am\r\n\r\nno  good at bluffing. It is true, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  game  of  bluff  is one which  I  find  a  very\r\n\r\nunprofitable and a very hazardous thing to do. I  am\r\n\r\ntelling  him right here and now. There are no  cards\r\n\r\nclosed; five cards in hand: changing - pretending  to\r\n\r\nchange  two, keeping three. None of that.  My  cards\r\n\r\nare  on  the  table. It is within the power  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to block this. If it does so, Malaysia is\r\n\r\npostponed: there will be general elections. But I am\r\n\r\nconfident, because the bits and pieces on the chess-board have been calculated. Even if he wanted to,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. cannot do it. They cannot go  against  the\r\n\r\nsignature of their own Tunku. And this is  what  the\r\n\r\nbundle  of documents handed in means. The Tunku  has\r\n\r\nagreed,  and unless they want to disavow  their  own\r\n\r\nparent   organisation,  they  must  vote   for   it.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  will go through. And  I  speak  this\r\n\r\nknowing  the bits and pieces on the chess-board,  as\r\n\r\nwe  always  try carefully to calculate the  possible\r\n\r\nmoves and counter-moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at last we have reached almost the end. Another 30 days. Midnight of 30th. One second past midnight, I hand over security, police, prisons, Army. I will no longer have an Infantry Regiment to salute me. They will only line up outside this Assembly by leave and licence of the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nBut  as against that, I will no longer have to  look\r\n\r\nand care for the safety of the Members opposite.  So\r\n\r\nit  is not such a bad exchange. We are going to keep\r\n\r\n72 to 73 per cent of our revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculation varies according to the projection.\r\n\r\nIt  is  between 72 and 73 per cent. Of course,  even\r\n\r\nbefore the agreement was signed, they denounced  it.\r\n\r\nThey  have always denounced it. The noose is  around\r\n\r\ntheir  throats  and they know it.  And  those  whose\r\n\r\nhearts  are  guilty must be unhappy at  nights.  And\r\n\r\nthat is as it should be. They have 30 days left. All\r\n\r\nI want is peace, quiet, tranquillity for the next 30\r\n\r\ndays. And I mean it. Whilst I am in charge, it is my\r\n\r\nduty  to  see  that law and order is maintained.  If\r\n\r\nanybody breaks it, he meets the consequences of  the\r\n\r\nlaw. It is quite simple. There are the courts. We go\r\n\r\nin  accordance with established practice. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson complains bitterly. He got  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairn-hill to side with him. As I have said,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  know which side he is on, except  that  I\r\n\r\nknow he is always on his own side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The wrong side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In this case, I think he is on\r\n\r\nthe wrong side, as my colleague has said, because if\r\n\r\nhe has been going around, he will know that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is a great deal of feeling about this. A blunt\r\n\r\nunthinking act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the broad agreement - the\r\n\r\nfinancial terms which for two weeks really  occupied\r\n\r\nso  much of our time and tested our nerves.  We  are\r\n\r\ngiving  27 per cent of our total revenue, or 40  per\r\n\r\ncent of national taxes, not giving it away free. All\r\n\r\nthe  police officers will be paid by the Federation.\r\n\r\nWe  have  5,000 officers as against the Federation's\r\n\r\n20,000, i.e. 25 per cent is in Singapore, to be paid\r\n\r\nfor.  Prisons - we have got two. We are now going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a new one and knock down the old one. I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  it  will not be my responsibility,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nquite prepared to forward any memoranda on the shape\r\n\r\nand size of the windows for sunshine and whether the\r\n\r\nbedsheet  should  be on the left-hand  side  or  the\r\n\r\nright-hand  side  of the wall. The people  who  have\r\n\r\ntried to ruin the country ought to be grateful  that\r\n\r\nno  worse  fate  is  in  store  for  them.

That is in the nature of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in return for this we have a Common Market. I\r\n\r\nexpected  this  to  be received at  least  by  right\r\n\r\nminded  men  who  are not Communists with  rapturous\r\n\r\napplause and praise for the Tunku, if not for me, at\r\n\r\nleast  for  generosity of the Tunku and his  Deputy.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Member for Anson has again  gone  off  the\r\n\r\nbeam. I read in the newspapers that he has denounced\r\n\r\nit  as  a sell-out: that we in four years have  done\r\n\r\nmore  damage than the British did in over a  hundred\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Than the Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Than the Japanese. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether he knows that this is the end of an era.  It\r\n\r\nwill  not be unfair to put it in this way:  that  as\r\n\r\nthings  get  tougher - and things  will  get  tougher\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  I  have said, we are not  showered  by\r\n\r\ncongratulations as we come into being (very far from\r\n\r\nit)  - we have to be on the lookout for enemy agents.\r\n\r\nI  mean \"enemy\" in the proper sense of the word,  in\r\n\r\nwar.  And those who aid and abet the enemy  will  go\r\n\r\ndown with him, and we will suffer none in our midst.\r\n\r\nThis,  I  am sure, reflects in a very mild  way  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  two Ministers I met last  week  - the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister of the  Federation  and  his\r\n\r\nclose colleague, the Minister for Internal Security.\r\n\r\nI  saw them with regard to the matters in the letter\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  tabled  in  this  Assembly.  I  also\r\n\r\ndiscussed  a few other things about the transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions on the 31st August. I can tell  them  and\r\n\r\nthe  Members on the other side that although we have\r\n\r\nour  quarrels  with the M.C.A., we  have  none  with\r\n\r\neither  the  Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation\r\n\r\nor   his   colleague,  the  Minister  for   Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity.  That  is  because  we  did   a   lot   of\r\n\r\ncalculation. I can tell them that knowing  them  for\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are, they are not likely  to  shirk  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to use their strength - and they  have\r\n\r\nstrength,  Mr Speaker; the Opposition  to  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshould  believe  me  when  I  say  that  they   have\r\n\r\nstrength;  do  not  believe that  all  these  little\r\n\r\nupheavals in Penang and Taiping are going  to  upset\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  No. They have real basic ground strength,\r\n\r\nand  they  have no hesitation in using that strength\r\n\r\nto see that Malaysia remains secure, prosperous, and\r\n\r\nprogressive. We are with them on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has criticised the Common\r\n\r\nMarket.  I  will leave the details to my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance. All I would say is  this:\r\n\r\neight wise men, learned in these matters, came  from\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank. They are men who drafted or  helped\r\n\r\nto  draft some of them, the Treaty of Rome, on which\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity  of the European Economic  Community\r\n\r\nwas based. The report has been published. Annex J of\r\n\r\nPaper Cmd. 22 of 1963 sets out all the main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  this Common Market. I quite  believe  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is an intelligent man. In fact, the\r\n\r\nthen  Colonial Secretary in 1956 said, in  a  rather\r\n\r\npatronising  way, that he was quite  an  intelligent\r\n\r\nfellow. But the trouble with him is that he  is  too\r\n\r\nclever.  I am prepared to put my reputation on  this\r\n\r\nmatter   on  the  side  of  eight  learned  experts,\r\n\r\npractical men of the world, whose business  is  high\r\n\r\nfinance and economics as against the judgment of the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. I am quite happy and satisfied  to\r\n\r\ntest  public  opinion  by  the  expressions  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of Commerce, whose  President  has\r\n\r\nwelcomed  it, and who is, in fact, in the  midst  of\r\n\r\nsetting up a few factories, and very wisely too - why\r\n\r\nnot,  and miss the opportunity? - the Indian  Chamber\r\n\r\nof   Commerce,  the  British  Singapore  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce.  These are men of commerce  and  trade  is\r\n\r\ntheir  lifeline, and they say, \"This is good.\"  Five\r\n\r\nyears   of  complete  free  port  status  while   we\r\n\r\nindustrialise product by product. For the next seven\r\n\r\nyears, we gradually harmonise. And we can refuse  to\r\n\r\nput  on any tariff but pay them a percentage of  the\r\n\r\ntaxes  which they would have got had we put a tariff\r\n\r\non.  In other words, we have 12 years in all. If  we\r\n\r\ncannot  succeed in 12 years, then I say, we  do  not\r\n\r\ndeserve  to succeed; we really will perish.  And  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  because  of the evil machinations  of  men\r\n\r\nopposite, and their smiles will be wiped off  their\r\n\r\nfaces when the moment of brutal truth dawns on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is literally the end of this era, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir  - three more days (today, tomorrow, and the  day\r\n\r\nafter),  then  we  adjourn sine die.  When  we  meet\r\n\r\nagain,  it  will  be under the new Constitution.  We\r\n\r\nshall  probably miss some old friends and  some  old\r\n\r\nenemies,  and maybe the country would be the  better\r\n\r\nfor it. I make no bones about it. We have fought and\r\n\r\nput  our  lives in our hands, and our necks  on  the\r\n\r\nchopping  block. For two years we have fought  them.\r\n\r\nAnd I will fight them for another 30 days, and never\r\n\r\nflinch  from it. I beseech the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nnot  to misjudge the situation. Twice he has already\r\n\r\nmade an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nerror   of  judgment,  now  leading  to  a  lot   of\r\n\r\ninconvenience  - flying out counsel - to  himself  and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues. I would much rather that  they  led\r\n\r\nmore  quiet and peaceful lives. They nearly  started\r\n\r\none  in  the  Harbour Board with 100-odd  hard  core\r\n\r\nchaps. I say, the Fire Brigade is ready. Let us have\r\n\r\nno  arson  before  the 31st of  August.  After  31st\r\n\r\nAugust  if they want to take on the Malaysian  Army,\r\n\r\nNavy,  Air Force, together with the P.K.I. on  their\r\n\r\nside,  it is up to them. Good luck to them.  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  the slightest doubt of the outcome and if  they\r\n\r\nare in doubt, they should have their heads examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, repent? I say no. I should not say this\r\n\r\nbecause I would like them to sleep well of nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger always has been a historical necessity\r\n\r\nand   those   who   oppose  it  will,   in   Marxist\r\n\r\nphraseology, be buried by history. My colleagues and\r\n\r\nI  on  this  side have read enough of Karl  Marx  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  their thinking. Buried by history,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis a phrase which means you are a fool. I mean \"you\"\r\n\r\nmetaphorically.  You went against  the  current  and\r\n\r\ninevitable process. My colleague says it is not  too\r\n\r\nlate. Well, good luck to them. Maybe if they change,\r\n\r\ngo  to  church and pray, or kneel down, count  their\r\n\r\nheads, there is still time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the battle really began in 1945, 18\r\n\r\nyears ago. But for the last four years, the dramatis\r\n\r\npersonoe   have  been - (1)   the  British   (2)    the\r\n\r\nCommunists  (3)   the Federation Government  (4)   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government. Four principal actors. Not all\r\n\r\nad  idem, Mr Speaker, Sir. From time to time,  each\r\n\r\nfinds   his   interests  affected  and  shifts   his\r\n\r\nposition. I will give you a simple illustration.  In\r\n\r\nLondon  when the British wanted us to cough  up  for\r\n\r\nBorneo, they were with the Federation side squeezing\r\n\r\nus  to  make us pay; they suggested a free  loan  of\r\n\r\n$150  million, free of interest for 10 years. I  was\r\n\r\nso  astounded  by the suggestion, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat I bit my lip. I calculated and I said that  was\r\n\r\n$80  million.  I got the shock of my  life.  So  the\r\n\r\nmatter  was  dropped. We were kept awake at  nights.\r\n\r\nMind  you,  so  were  the  British  team.  But  they\r\n\r\nsustained themselves with pots of - I saw some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhot  milk being boiled, while they offered us whisky\r\n\r\nand  soda,  which I thought was a very friendly  and\r\n\r\nhospitable  way  of  doing business  - abstemious  on\r\n\r\ntheir  part,  hospitable to  those  who  were  their\r\n\r\nguests.  They only gave up one night or  rather  one\r\n\r\nmorning. I think it was Thursday morning before  the\r\n\r\nMonday  we  signed, when they sent a  representative\r\n\r\nand banged on our Committee Room. We said we were in\r\n\r\nsession  and in popped the Deputy U.K. Commissioner.\r\n\r\nHe  found  us  sitting down with  a  typewriter  box\r\n\r\nstacked  with  sandwiches and  all  other  necessary\r\n\r\ncondiments and sustenance for the battle. Then  they\r\n\r\ngave  up.  Because he knew we could go on well  into\r\n\r\nbreakfast  time and it would still be $103  million,\r\n\r\nfive  years free of interest, labour from Singapore.\r\n\r\nThen they gave up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moment we put the claims on the British, an\r\n\r\nimmense  transformation took place.  The  Federation\r\n\r\nMinisters,  three  of  them,  suddenly  became   our\r\n\r\nallies.  They became our great friends and supported\r\n\r\nus  in the claim to get the land back and get a  lot\r\n\r\nof  money. Because, not unnaturally, the more  money\r\n\r\nwe  got, the more money we were likely to give them.\r\n\r\nThese were the strains and stresses between the four\r\n\r\nprincipal parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as a good Marxist, if I were the Member\r\n\r\nfor    Queenstown,    I    would    exploit    these\r\n\r\ncontradictions.  There  was a contradiction  between\r\n\r\nthe  Members on the Front bench opposite and us over\r\n\r\nthe  15  seats. He could have exploited  it  to  his\r\n\r\nadvantage. He threw it away. He will never know what\r\n\r\na  ghastly  error  it  was. Here  we  were  all  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We  were  all for a  non-Communist  - they\r\n\r\nwanted  an  anti-Communist, we want a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nMalaysia - never mind. Anyway, no Communist. But  for\r\n\r\nvarious reasons, we wanted 15 seats before Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThey  had  a chance to prove to the world  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, if ever they believed  in  it,\r\n\r\nwere  against Malaysia. They say the referendum  was\r\n\r\nrigged. Here was the chance of a contradiction to be\r\n\r\nexploited, but it was thrown away. Alas,  what  poor\r\n\r\nMarxists they were!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, what happens after? I have given a fair\r\n\r\nresume  of  what has taken place. Of  course,  there\r\n\r\nwere  some  side characters - clowns, court  jesters,\r\n\r\ngeneral  retinue.  The Member for Anson  played  his\r\n\r\npart, a useful sounding board. From time to time  he\r\n\r\ncomes  in  like one of these Punch and  Judy  shows.\r\n\r\nSuddenly  the lion roars, dashes across  the  stage,\r\n\r\nvanishes.  The  Member for Cairnhi1l,  the  faithful\r\n\r\nfollower and retinue, defended by the Alliance,  who\r\n\r\nsaid he was only taking orders as is his duty if  he\r\n\r\nwants to survive. Then there was Dr Faust - Dr Lee,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown. He was Dr Faust. He went\r\n\r\nto  Medical College and he never read this  book.  I\r\n\r\nwent  to  Raffles College and I read a  little  book\r\n\r\ncalled \"Dr Faust\". A man. Marlow, wrote this  book.\r\n\r\nHe  said Faust sold his soul to the devil. He bought\r\n\r\ntime  and  had a wonderful time in the `process;  he\r\n\r\ndid  everything he wanted. What a glorious time - the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the masses. What did he say  over  T.V.?\r\n\r\nEighty-thousand people, he said, turned  up  at  his\r\n\r\nMay  Day  rally  last  year  and  this  year  40,000 - braggadocio.  This  year  we  counted  there   were\r\n\r\n12,000. Last year we counted there were 30,000.  But\r\n\r\nnevertheless,   tumultuous   applause;    systematic\r\n\r\napplause,  Sir,  the rhythmic clap  is  a  wonderful\r\n\r\nthing; it is a thrill that only those who have  been\r\n\r\non  the platform with the microphone can understand;\r\n\r\nthe  sensation of power - ecstasy. \"But the time  has\r\n\r\ncome,\"  says Mephistopheles. \"Your time is up.\"  And\r\n\r\nso it will be. Thursday night, the end of an era - as\r\n\r\nyou  leave  the  Chamber, if you do not  mind,  Sir,\r\n\r\nafter  you  have left the Chamber, for old  friends'\r\n\r\nsake,  Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot - Auld  Lang\r\n\r\nSyne.  We  meet again under a new flag. The  British\r\n\r\nUnion Jack is down. No nonsense about all this  neo-colonialism. Everybody who says that the  Federation\r\n\r\nParliament is a neo-colonialist one, will  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith in a summary manner, and quite rightly so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been others. The Member for Hong Lim and\r\n\r\nhis famous resolutions. He plays a curious role, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. He is like a vulture waiting  for  our\r\n\r\nfriends in the Barisan to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisappear.  The Barisan has got a flag dashing  into\r\n\r\nbattle with slogans on it. He has the same flag with\r\n\r\nthe  same slogans. He is hoping that when that  flag\r\n\r\nis  burnt up, the followers will take the lead  from\r\n\r\nhis  flag, and so he inherits the 25 per cent  blank\r\n\r\nvotes. But he is clever enough not to get too close.\r\n\r\nIf he is too close, then when the fire is opened, he\r\n\r\nmight   get  killed.  So  he  leaves  a  respectable\r\n\r\ndistance  between the Barisan flag  and  himself.  I\r\n\r\nwould say that he could be Mephistopheles if he were\r\n\r\nborn in a different age, because he had the kind  of\r\n\r\napproach  for it. I was reading the papers.  He  was\r\n\r\nexhorting  us to massacre the Opposition.  \"Ah,  ah,\r\n\r\nhere  is another swipe coming.\" Waiting for  it,  he\r\n\r\nsays.  \"If  only  these chaps  will  disappear.\"  No\r\n\r\nleaders left. He has the same slogans. Whatever they\r\n\r\nsay, he says one day afterwards. One day afterwards,\r\n\r\nhe  comes  out  with the same slogans. Sometimes  he\r\n\r\nmakes a mistake, but he quickly retracts because  he\r\n\r\nis wise enough to see he does not get into trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Three cheers for Azahari,\" said the Barisan. One\r\n\r\nday  later,  the  Member for Hong Lim  said,  \"Three\r\n\r\ncheers for Azahari.\" One week later, he said,  \"Down\r\n\r\nwith Azahari because he is anti-Chinese.\" And by the\r\n\r\ntime Azahari got to Jakarta, he said, \"Down with the\r\n\r\nwhole  Brunei revolt.\" He was in favour of Singapore\r\n\r\nhelping  to  keep down the Brunei rebels.  He  is  a\r\n\r\nvulture   of   no  mean  intelligence   hut   rather\r\n\r\nsuperficial.  He  also never calculated  beyond  the\r\n\r\nbrink.  What happens after the abyss? I  say,  quite\r\n\r\nfrankly, in the new era, those who wobbled along the\r\n\r\nbrink  will  find it a bit gusty and  windy.  It  is\r\n\r\nbetter to come hack safely to land, abjure all these\r\n\r\nthings,  denounce  Communism and  adventurism.  They\r\n\r\nhave  denounced  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunist  in their publication. I  have  it  here\r\n\r\nwith  me. The word they use is \"opportunist\" in  the\r\n\r\nPlebeian.  I say that the biggest opportunists  were\r\n\r\nthe 13 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, 14 of them. They thought\r\n\r\nthey  were  going  to win. I am not interested,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in who wins or loses. I am determined\r\n\r\nto  see  that  Singapore  survives  as  a  coherent,\r\n\r\nsensible and happy society. I have a stake in  this,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir. I  do not  sell  the  Tunku  De\r\n\r\nHavilland aeroplanes or try to build airports. I  am\r\n\r\nnot in the contracting business. But I have a family\r\n\r\nhere rooted, unable to run away, and I am determined\r\n\r\nto  see  that Singapore remains a happy and sensible\r\n\r\nplace where nobody is slitting each other's throats,\r\n\r\nshouting  mass slogans and ending up  in  chaos  and\r\n\r\nanarchy. There will be a new play when we next meet.\r\n\r\nAfter this Session, we will prorogue. There will  be\r\n\r\na  recess,  a  new  Constitution, and  new  dramatis\r\n\r\npersonae.  But we will be deluding ourselves  if  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the Communists have been  disposed  of\r\n\r\njust  by  merger and Malaysia. We will  be  deluding\r\n\r\nourselves  if we believe that by scrubbing  out  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  or knocking out a few of the front  leaders\r\n\r\nthe  ground  position will be resolved.  The  ground\r\n\r\nposition  has improved not because the  Barisan  has\r\n\r\nbeen  scrubbed out but because they have  been  left\r\n\r\nthere to make mistakes and to expose themselves  for\r\n\r\nthe  lot  of  political adventurers and opportunists\r\n\r\nthat  they were - anti the people. Finally,  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat they came to. They who talked of the masses ran\r\n\r\naway from the masses that night in Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever our shortcomings - I do not make any\r\n\r\npretence;  we  have  quite a  number  - there  is  no\r\n\r\nanaemia amongst my colleagues. We do not suffer from\r\n\r\nleukemia. We have enough red corpuscles to  see  the\r\n\r\ncountry  through. Yes, we lost Hong  Lim  two  years\r\n\r\nago. We will go back and fight again. They booed  us\r\n\r\nat  the referendum. They got booed back. They  booed\r\n\r\nus  at  Jalan Besar. They were booed back, and  they\r\n\r\nnearly ran away too. But that night at Hong Lim  one\r\n\r\nweek  ago,  was  poetic  justice.  All  I  did,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, was to draw the attention of the crowd\r\n\r\nto  the  fact that here were people who were moaning\r\n\r\nthe fact that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  was  going  into a haven  of  security  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  And  they got so frightened  that  they\r\n\r\nswitched  off  the lights, ran down the  stairs  and\r\n\r\nscooted. [Interruption in Mandarin] The camera  does\r\n\r\nnot  lie. They are always afraid of the camera. They\r\n\r\ngo   round  like  bandits  tying  handkerchiefs  and\r\n\r\ncovering  up  their  noses. Why?  Are  these  really\r\n\r\nheroes of the revolution? Did Lenin do these things,\r\n\r\nstay  in  his  Party headquarters and send  pregnant\r\n\r\nwomen  into battle? Really, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  bothered and concerned with the front  leaders,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am bothered and concerned with the gentlemen\r\n\r\nthat  I  have met whom the police cannot  find,  and\r\n\r\nthey are men of no mean calibre. Yes, I concede that\r\n\r\nwe have never made the error of under-estimating our\r\n\r\nopponents' capacity for harm, and they have enormous\r\n\r\ncapacity  for  harm. With a small group  of  people,\r\n\r\nthey can mount an enormous offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last rally in Shenton Way for the\r\n\r\nreferendum, they were really good, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  can  only think of the Catholic Church as equally\r\n\r\nwell  versed in these things - the expertise. I  was\r\n\r\nwatching  the Coronation on television in Europe  as\r\n\r\nit  took place by Teistar linkup, and Pope Paul  was\r\n\r\n`crowned not inside St. Peter's but outside  in  the\r\n\r\nSquare with 500,000 people watching. It was a really\r\n\r\nmassive  demonstration and an  emotional  experience\r\n\r\nnot  likely to be forgotten by those who took  part,\r\n\r\nand  on  television for the world. I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthey  must  have  studied some of  these  things.  I\r\n\r\nhappened  to be in St. Peter's when the  first  Pope\r\n\r\nappeared   on   television  and  it  was   quite   a\r\n\r\nfascinating  experience. I have  said  this  before,\r\n\r\nwithout  irreverance, that I admired  and  respected\r\n\r\nthe  technique. The Pope came out in  his  palanquin\r\n\r\nshouldered by chaps with scabbards and hats  and  so\r\n\r\non  with  due pomp and panoply. As he came down  the\r\n\r\naisle,  I  heard shouts of \"Viva il  Papa\"  and  the\r\n\r\ncrowd underneath shouted \"Viva il Papa\" and nuns and\r\n\r\nother  devotees went into an ecstasy. Then I  looked\r\n\r\nup  at  the pillars and at each pillar on the  aisle\r\n\r\nwas a set of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchoir  boys. They knew how to do it. They  triggered\r\n\r\nit  off  with \"Viva il Papa\" and there was a  ground\r\n\r\nreaction  of \"Viva ii Papa\". It was very  good,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. When 1 saw that Coronation,  I  said,\r\n\r\nnow  that  was the way to install a Government  - not\r\n\r\nthis silly business. We tried to do that in the City\r\n\r\nHall  but  it was not quite as good. Next  time,  we\r\n\r\nwill do better. We live and learn. Oh yes, we always\r\n\r\nlearn. Never make the error of believing that we are\r\n\r\nobtuse,   obstinate  and  obdurate.  When  we   make\r\n\r\nmistakes, we admit them and we learn from them.  The\r\n\r\nold  Ministers used to be sworn in inside Government\r\n\r\nHouse  - a little private cosy party - and then  they\r\n\r\ndrank  sherry  with each other.  But  the  Pope  was\r\n\r\nthere.  There  were 500,000 people  in  St.  Peter's\r\n\r\nSquare  packed like sardines and everybody who  took\r\n\r\npart in it would remember it to his dying day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they tried to do something like that in Shenton\r\n\r\nWay.  We  watched it. We sent chaps to  watch.  Five\r\n\r\nhundred  chaps will suddenly walk off and then  walk\r\n\r\nround the block and come back the other side. So you\r\n\r\nget a feeling that lots of fellows are coming to the\r\n\r\nmeeting. In fact, they are the same chaps - the  same\r\n\r\n30,000  fellows. That was what they had  there  - the\r\n\r\nmaximum.  But they were good - the clapping  and  the\r\n\r\ncheering. They were trained and they made a  lot  of\r\n\r\nnoise  for  30,000 chaps. But then the ballot  boxes\r\n\r\nwere opened that night, the Member for Nee Soon  - he\r\n\r\nhas  lost interest now in life generally or  lie  is\r\n\r\nfed up with all politics and quite rightly so. If  I\r\n\r\nwere   him,   I  would  be  fed  up  with  politics.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  Yes, his survival  instinct  is  the\r\n\r\nbest of them all. He is the most intelligent chap of\r\n\r\nthe  lot. That is why he cannot be bothered with all\r\n\r\nthis.  Why  should  he? This is all  leading  to  an\r\n\r\nimpasse,  a  confrontasi  from  which  there  is  no\r\n\r\nretreat. And he does not want to be in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us never forget that the battle goes on. We\r\n\r\nwill  be  deluding ourselves. And I want  to  stress\r\n\r\nthis because sometimes in jest one says things which\r\n\r\nare taken seriously. I do not believe you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  resolve these things by just chopping off a few\r\n\r\nheads.  It cannot be done that way. It can  be  done\r\n\r\n- we  have demonstrated that it is possible  - by  two\r\n\r\nconcurrent  weapons.  One  is  economic  and  social\r\n\r\nprogress, an expanding economy, a rising standard of\r\n\r\nliving and rising expectations. We turned the  tide,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  when we  built  houses,  homes,\r\n\r\nschools,  clinics and community centres.  There  was\r\n\r\nthe  tangible evidence of a better life. That is the\r\n\r\nfirst  arm and that was why we were determined  that\r\n\r\nwe should keep our money to provide amenities to the\r\n\r\npeople even if it meant no merger. But it would have\r\n\r\nbrought merger anyway because there was too much  at\r\n\r\nstake.  Even if for the moment, let us  say  it  was\r\n\r\npostponed for six months or for one year,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  come hack because the basic factors  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other arm is the open argument. They lost out\r\n\r\non  the open argument. They were telling lies to the\r\n\r\npeople  that they were sold out on citizenship.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, who was with them, suddenly  right\r\n\r\nabout   turned   and  bit  them   and   said,   \"Oh,\r\n\r\nmiraculous.\"  Now  he has decided  that  he  has  no\r\n\r\nchance to cash in on the pro-merger support.  So  he\r\n\r\ngoes  hack to anti-merger. What he lacks is a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  ballast in him, otherwise he would  not  be\r\n\r\ndoing  these things. He is like a straw in the wind.\r\n\r\nHe  is  a  bit erratic. As I have said, in that  one\r\n\r\nyear  when he was Chief Minister, never was so  much\r\n\r\nhumbug enacted by so erratic a Chief Minister in  so\r\n\r\nshort  a time. I have to crib Churchill for that.  I\r\n\r\nthink that was what I meant. [Interruption] No, Sir.\r\n\r\nI will not be so unkind as to say that. One makes up\r\n\r\none's  mind  where one stands. Everybody  recognises\r\n\r\nafter  a  while;  it  may take  sonic  tune.  People\r\n\r\nthought  we did sell out Singapore and so  on.  They\r\n\r\nwere  spreading the lie to the people. They  thought\r\n\r\nthat with their cadres on the ground and signing all\r\n\r\nthese  petitions  and organising and,  according  to\r\n\r\nthem,  98 per cent of Kreta Ayer was against merger.\r\n\r\nSo they said. When the ballot boxes were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopened,  they  got the shock of their lives  because\r\n\r\nKreta  Ayer  had the least of the blank votes.  What\r\n\r\nwas it - three per cent, four per cent? Three or four\r\n\r\nper  cent.  They were clever people. They  were  not\r\n\r\nlike our Alliance friends. Our Alliance friends were\r\n\r\nwaddling  around not knowing what it was all  about.\r\n\r\nBut  they had 14 chaps. They knew that we wanted  to\r\n\r\nknow  where  their support was. They  did  not  know\r\n\r\nwhich constituency was on which table; but we had to\r\n\r\nhave 51 tables for 51 constituencies. I concede when\r\n\r\nmy  opponent intelligently beats my plan. They  knew\r\n\r\nthat  if we wanted to know the result we must  count\r\n\r\ntable  by  table. And so into the ballot boxes  they\r\n\r\nthrew in the ballot paper and the polling card which\r\n\r\nshowed  the  constituency. It  was  very  clever.  A\r\n\r\nsubmarine device; an anti-submarine mine.  The  next\r\n\r\ntime they go there, they will find that we will also\r\n\r\nput in polling cards of many constituencies all into\r\n\r\nthe  same  boxes. They will then have to  think  out\r\n\r\nanother way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the men behind them are intelligent. They never\r\n\r\ndid  this.  I wanted to do this the intelligent  way\r\n\r\nbecause  I  know  the battle goes  on.  So  I  said,\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen  seats, fight it.\" No power is attached  to\r\n\r\nthe  15 seats. This is important. But the men behind\r\n\r\nare  intelligent. They never did this. For with  the\r\n\r\n15  seats we could have proved to the world that the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  were for Malaysia  definitely\r\n\r\nbeyond  any doubt. We could also have found out  how\r\n\r\nmuch their support has been whittled down in the one\r\n\r\nyear.  Yes. And if anything goes wrong, it does  not\r\n\r\nmatter because it is a controlled experiment. It  is\r\n\r\nonly 15 seats. No power. 15 in 159 seats. There  was\r\n\r\na  long-stop. The wicket-keeper, long-stop. But I am\r\n\r\nthinking of obtuse gentlemen now. A forced 51  seats\r\n\r\nbefore  March next year. They probably thought  they\r\n\r\ncould get an advantage, an edge over us. We had also\r\n\r\ntaken  that  into  account. Hence the  back  of  the\r\n\r\nenvelope says \"delegation of powers to detain secret\r\n\r\nsociety gangsters.\" That is one of the amendments in\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd.  24. There will be no gangsters  running\r\n\r\naround at election time. They have also learnt. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlive and learn. If chaps switch sides, the next time\r\n\r\nthey  will go out of this Chamber. Why not?  Anybody\r\n\r\nwho  comes  into this Chamber on the  basis  of  his\r\n\r\nParty's symbol, when he backs out from the Party, he\r\n\r\nleaves. Yes. We must be prepared to live, learn  and\r\n\r\ninnovate. And I say we will do it. What is more,  if\r\n\r\nwe are intelligent, we will succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into the constitutional\r\n\r\nprovisions - I will take probably 45 minutes to  draw\r\n\r\nMembers'  attention to the important parts - I  would\r\n\r\nlike to place on record my appreciation and that  of\r\n\r\nmy  Government  for  the dedication  of  a  band  of\r\n\r\nofficials who were not only able but who also worked\r\n\r\nvery  hard.  They went beyond the normal  bounds  of\r\n\r\nduty.  They fought for what was right for  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  do the right thing by the Government they serve.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to say to them that their effort  was\r\n\r\nappreciated.  It  made a big difference  because  it\r\n\r\nsaved  me  from having to read every single document\r\n\r\nfrom  cover to cover. I have to peruse them. But  it\r\n\r\ndoes help if we know that some sharp intellects have\r\n\r\nbeen  through them, marked up the parts which looked\r\n\r\ndubious or spurious and left me to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem, over the years, as the enemy\r\n\r\nunderground    increases   in    intelligence    and\r\n\r\nexperience,  is  to  find more and  more  people  of\r\n\r\nability on our side, because ultimately this  battle\r\n\r\ncan only be won if there are enough men of integrity\r\n\r\nand ability to run the democratic system. Two things\r\n\r\nare  fundamental. If there is no integrity the whole\r\n\r\nthing  is a humbug. If it is self interest, then  it\r\n\r\nwill  go down in corruption, decadence and disarray.\r\n\r\nIf  there  is  integrity,  piety  and  goodness  but\r\n\r\nwithout  the  ability to give it the drive  and  the\r\n\r\ndynamism  that it requires, then it cannot  go  very\r\n\r\nfar. That is our problem, both in the public service\r\n\r\nand  in  public  life generally. And  as  we  secure\r\n\r\nstability  in  Malaysia, it is more likely  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  draw  men  out. More and more  are  taking  on\r\n\r\nduties    and    responsibilities    beyond    their\r\n\r\nprofessional lines, as members of public boards  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  corporations.  More  and  more  will   be\r\n\r\nconvinced that they have a duty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  a  role to society if they want the good things\r\n\r\nthat  they know and the good features of this system\r\n\r\nto endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now may I run through very rapidly the\r\n\r\nimportant provisions? I have not the slightest doubt\r\n\r\nthat  they will be attacked by Members on the  other\r\n\r\nside.  I  am not the slightest bit concerned because\r\n\r\nthey are honourable terms. They can be defended  and\r\n\r\njustified at any time and every time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, if they will turn to what is the most\r\n\r\nimportant  section - page 73 of Paper Cmd. 22.  There\r\n\r\nin  Part  II,  Members will see our local  autonomy:\r\n\r\nEducation,  Medicine,  Labour and  social  security,\r\n\r\nPensions,  Factories. Concurrent  List  - List  IIIB.\r\n\r\nThese  are  all  under  the  control  of  the  State\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  think  I  would  like  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of Members to item 20 at page 74:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Until the end of August, 1968, and thereafter\r\n\r\nuntil  Parliament with the concurrence of the  State\r\n\r\ngovernment   .... elections  to  the   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And so all this humbug that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\ncannot be trusted to conduct the elections will  now\r\n\r\ncease.  This  is  what the Tunku signed  and  agreed\r\n\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one section for which an amendment\r\n\r\nwill still have to come. There will still be several\r\n\r\namendments. One is the authority for prosecution  by\r\n\r\nthe State Advocate-General. That will be made by  an\r\n\r\namendment to the Criminal Procedure Code. We are not\r\n\r\nquite  sure yet how best to do it. The parliamentary\r\n\r\ndraftsmen  in  Kuala Lumpur and our State  Advocate-General are in consultation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if I may run quickly - page 98 of the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution. Article 131 provides for appeals  from\r\n\r\nthe Supreme Court to the Federal Court. Then at page\r\n\r\n35,  Article  50 of Command 22 of 1963: Audit.  Then\r\n\r\npages  213 to 231, minor amendments to the  customs,\r\n\r\nexcise  and  income  tax laws  under  the  financial\r\n\r\nagreement. Members know that this was a vital matter\r\n\r\nin  issue. Who collects'? This is a matter  of  very\r\n\r\ngreat importance. I am happy to report that we  have\r\n\r\nresolved  it.  We  will collect  and  the  power  is\r\n\r\ndelegated  to us irrevocably, and the  only  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich it can be revoked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  if the Singapore Government is unable, unwilling\r\n\r\nor  incapable of collecting, and whether it is or is\r\n\r\nnot,  it  is  a  matter which can be tested  in  the\r\n\r\ncourts. That is provided for in the Annex, page 230;\r\n\r\nparagraph  10.  \"Disputes as  to  interpretation  or\r\n\r\napplication of this Agreement.\" In other  words,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  justiciable issue, not one which is  for  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister of the Federation to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadcasting and Television - page 232. Members will\r\n\r\nsee   that   we   are  in  charge  of   the   staff,\r\n\r\nadministration  and  the day-to-day  programmes.  We\r\n\r\nwill  have,  as we expand, the right  to  have  more\r\n\r\nradio frequencies and channels for transmissions  of\r\n\r\ntelevision programmes. Any over-all policy  will  be\r\n\r\nof pan-Malaysian application unless, for some reason\r\n\r\nof  national interest or of national importance,  it\r\n\r\nshould be applicable in the rest of Malaysia but not\r\n\r\nin  Kuala Lumpur. In other words, what was agreed in\r\n\r\nthe White Paper is now enshrined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 137, Article 8: Cabinet to exercise general\r\n\r\ncontrol, direction of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 19, Article 23: Citizenship. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Anson is complaining about.  He\r\n\r\nsaid that it was miraculous in August last year when\r\n\r\nwe  all became Malaysian citizens. Now he says it is\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizenship because we are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto  vote in the Federation. I just do not understand\r\n\r\nit,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir. He knew that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nchange  in the position. It was as stated.  What  is\r\n\r\nenshrined  here was what was stated in the  exchange\r\n\r\nof  letters in July and August last year. I may  add\r\n\r\nthat  the  voting  disability  is  reciprocal.  They\r\n\r\ncannot come here. We cannot go there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common Market and Tariff Board, page 34: Article 48\r\n\r\n(c). The constitution of this Tariff Board and rules\r\n\r\ncannot  be altered without our concurrence.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwant   to   make   this  point.  All   these   State\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  -  religious  freedom,  education,\r\n\r\nlabour,   Tariff  Board  - I  think  there  is   some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding, particularly with the Church,  and\r\n\r\nI had to make a statement on freedom of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreligion. No government can bind all governments for\r\n\r\nall  time. It is not in the book of law to do  that.\r\n\r\nWhat  we can do is to hind ourselves. If some future\r\n\r\nState  Government  gives  the  concurrence  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation to alter this, then these things  can  be\r\n\r\naltered.  They  are alterable with consent.  It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be that 50 years from now, when we become more\r\n\r\nhomogeneous,  more united, I think in the  long  run\r\n\r\nperhaps  quite a lot of these other items should  go\r\n\r\nto the centre. But it must be done on a quid pro quo\r\n\r\nbasis. If more goes to the centre, then as we put in\r\n\r\nmore   money   to   the  centre  to  discharge   its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in the centre, so  we  should  send\r\n\r\nmore  representative to the centre. But the point  I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  make  is  this.  All  these  State\r\n\r\nprivileges which are safeguarded are safeguarded  to\r\n\r\nthis extent: that the Constitution cannot be changed\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent of the Singapore Government.  I\r\n\r\nthink  lawyers understand this. But I would like  to\r\n\r\nstress  it  for  the  purpose  of  the  lay  reader,\r\n\r\nparticularly to the newspapers and other mass media,\r\n\r\nthat   a  future  State  Government  which  is   not\r\n\r\ncommitted to this policy can change it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention also to page 26, section 32,\r\n\r\n\"Liaison as to citizenship\". They have to inform  us\r\n\r\nof  naturalisation, and I think they must  be  on  a\r\n\r\nconcurrent  basis. They are going to  naturalise  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and other citizens - sections  31\r\n\r\nand 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on pages 38 and 39, the Singapore branch of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Services Commission, section 55  (1)   to\r\n\r\n(8) .   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  you   will   find   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  safeguards in page 47,  section  69,\r\n\r\nthe most important paragraph of which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution\r\n\r\nwithout  the concurrence of the Governor [`Governor'\r\n\r\nhere  means  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara]  if  the\r\n\r\namendment is such as to affect the operation of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution in relation to Singapore as regards any\r\n\r\nof the following matters -',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  one of them is religion in the State. In  other\r\n\r\nwords, there can be no legislation. As I have stated\r\n\r\npublicly, I am not a supporter of immorality, but my\r\n\r\nGovernment   does  not  intend  to   introduce   any\r\n\r\nlegislation  regarding khalwat  (I  think  it  means\r\n\r\n\"found in close proximity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder suspicious circumstances\"), and other offences\r\n\r\nconnected with the Muslim law, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then page 30 - there is now an amendment which will\r\n\r\nbe  included in page 30, for delegated power to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government to detain for  secret  society\r\n\r\nactivities.  The  C.P.I.B. - I think  this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant section - is contained in the first  of  the\r\n\r\nletters in Paper Misc. 5, at page 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sixthly, it is agreed that because of the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Government in the  prevention  of\r\n\r\ncorruption,   the  organization   of   the   Corrupt\r\n\r\nPractices Investigation Bureau and the powers of the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General in relation to the prevention\r\n\r\nof  corruption  under the Prevention  of  Corruption\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  1959,  will not be altered  without  the\r\n\r\nconsent of the Singapore Government.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I  have  tried  to get  that  point  into  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, but I am afraid time was  so  pressing\r\n\r\non  the 8th of July that we had to leave it only  in\r\n\r\nthis exchange of letters. I would like to point  out\r\n\r\nthat  where  there  is a response  in  reply  to  an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  letters,  then  that  goes  into   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. For the others, they are covered in my\r\n\r\nletter  of the 22nd of July where there is  just  an\r\n\r\nagreement. But it is open to a subsequent Government\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation  - I  do not  think  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment will go back on its words - if it is a non-Alliance Government, to go back on it if it desires,\r\n\r\nbecause  the C.P.I.B. will not be enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  But the fact that  it  continues  and\r\n\r\nwill continue with civilian investigators will be  a\r\n\r\nvery  powerful  deterrent  to  keep  in  check   the\r\n\r\nexcessive use or any abuse of power of officials  in\r\n\r\nall  departments  of the State.  If  I  may  mention\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  departments  who   think   that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Central Government is far  away  - like\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Immigration which will  pass  into  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Central Government - 260  miles  away,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they might get away with it.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  useful that we should have these  powers  to\r\n\r\nprosecute locally through the State Advocate-General\r\n\r\nand civilian investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections is at page 63, section 95. There you will\r\n\r\nsee,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  provision  made  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to conduct the first elections.\r\n\r\nThese 15 elected representatives will go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  beyond the general elections which will be  held\r\n\r\nin  the Federation after Malaysia Day. Our intention\r\n\r\nthen  was  that  elections  should  be  held  before\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Day  and  then the 15 elected  would  take\r\n\r\ntheir places in the Federal Parliament, and when the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament dissolves, as it must under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution   in   the  middle   of   1964,   these\r\n\r\nrepresentatives will remain Members for the life  of\r\n\r\nthe  second  term;  in other words,  for  the  first\r\n\r\nParliament elected throughout Malaysia. However, our\r\n\r\nplans  are  somewhat  altered now  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\ndecision  taken by the Opposition, and  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshall    have    51   Members   here   before    our\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   will   appear   in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.  There  may  have  to  be  some  interim\r\n\r\nprovision    for    a   token   representation    by\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. I do not propose  to  have  the  15\r\n\r\nelected  from  this House. It may well  be  that  we\r\n\r\nmight  send  two  or  three Ministers  to  represent\r\n\r\nSingapore   until   the   elections   for   the   15\r\n\r\nrepresentatives take place, which  I  hope  will  be\r\n\r\ndone not so very long after Malaysia now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fundamental liberties are all enshrined in\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Constitution - for easy reference,  the\r\n\r\nsecond edition of the Federal Constitution (Articles\r\n\r\n5  to  13)  can be found in pages 28-32. And  it  is\r\n\r\nsubject to section 60 of Paper Cmd. 22 at page 4l-2,\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that  so long as we  have  autonomy  in\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Education, there will be power  through\r\n\r\nEducation   and   Labour  laws  to  prevent   double\r\n\r\nenjoyment.  Sir,  I  made this  quite  clear  in  my\r\n\r\nstatement to this House which was published  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial arrangements, Paper Misc. 4 of 1963,  when\r\n\r\nI  stated that this provision had been agreed to.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is Document VI, at page 50 of Paper - sorry,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, it has not been flagged but I will\r\n\r\ngive the reference later and I do not think I should\r\n\r\ntake  the  time of the House. I made it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthen. I will give the reference at a later date, and\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is also in Hansard. You may  remember,\r\n\r\nSir, that there cannot be double enjoyment. It is as\r\n\r\nmuch   in  our  interests  as  in  the  Federation's\r\n\r\ninterest,  because  if either side  introduces  free\r\n\r\nsecondary education - let me put it in a neutral  way\r\n\r\n- ahead  of the other, then there is bound  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndrip of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  from  one territory to the  other  seeking\r\n\r\nthat  free education. And since tax is paid  by  one\r\n\r\nterritory - it is only paid by the residents of  that\r\n\r\nterritory - then the enjoyment of the rights  of  free\r\n\r\neducation should only be limited to people  of  that\r\n\r\nterritory.  By  way  of example,  if  we  give  free\r\n\r\nsecondary education, then we would want to have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  prevent  students from other  territories\r\n\r\ncoming into our schools and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly in the first phase of factories in\r\n\r\nJurong,  we may, not unnaturally - and I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  over-emphasise this point because we want to  be\r\n\r\nflexible about it - want to have the right to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  only  Singapore citizens are employed  in  the\r\n\r\nfactories. And similarly if a steel mill were put up\r\n\r\nin  Johore next to an iron mine, they may - not  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  - require as part of the terms that  only\r\n\r\ncitizens of Johore are employed. And so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free port status, Mr Speaker, Sir, page 226, sets\r\n\r\nout  the  Common Market arrangements and the gradual\r\n\r\nerosion of the free port over a period of 12  years,\r\n\r\nright up to 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The franchise of Singapore citizens is set out in\r\n\r\npage  26,  Article  31.  The  reciprocity  is  there\r\n\r\n- citizens  and nobody else vote here, and  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizens who are not Singapore citizens cannot  vote\r\n\r\nhere.  We will have to decide later on on the  basis\r\n\r\nof reciprocity, the residence period required before\r\n\r\na man decides to be one or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Arrangements - Annex J. Financial Review\r\n\r\n- page  229, paragraph 8. I think that is a matter  of\r\n\r\nsome importance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The arrangements specified in paragraphs 6 and 7\r\n\r\nabove  shall remain in operation until31st December,\r\n\r\n1964.  The  two Governments shall then review  these\r\n\r\narrangements and shall decide upon any amendments to\r\n\r\nbe  made  to them in respect of the two year  period\r\n\r\ncommencing  1st  January, 1965.  There  shall  be  a\r\n\r\nsimilar review in respect of each subsequent  period\r\n\r\nof  two  years. In default of agreement between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments,  any issue  in  dispute  shall  be\r\n\r\nreferred   to  an  independent  assessor   appointed\r\n\r\njointly  by  the  two  Governments.  In  default  of\r\n\r\nagreement between the two Governments on the  choice\r\n\r\nof an assessor, the Lord President of the Federal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt, after   considering  the  views   of   both\r\n\r\ngovernments,  shall appoint an assessor  from  among\r\n\r\npersons  recommended by the Inter-national Bank  for\r\n\r\nReconstruction  and  Development  as  being  persons\r\n\r\nenjoying an international reputation in finance. The\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the assessor shall be binding  on\r\n\r\nboth governments. Such reviews shall have regard  to\r\n\r\nall relevant factors.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Hence, the importance of Paper Misc. 4, for, in  our\r\n\r\ncontention, as you will see from the papers that  we\r\n\r\nhave put up, even on the basis of their full Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure being, in fact, extended, which we doubt\r\n\r\nand  I  do not think they will do it just to  spite\r\n\r\nus,  because,  as I have said, they  have  to  spend\r\n\r\n$8.20 to $8.30 to our $1.70 to $1.80 for which  they\r\n\r\nhave  to spend the rest of their $10 from their  own\r\n\r\npockets,   and  they  have  to  take  into   account\r\n\r\ndonations  made  by  the British or  other  friendly\r\n\r\ngovernments  to  us for Defence.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nrestate  or  state again our position. Our  view  is\r\n\r\nthat on their figures, we say it is 34.3 per cent of\r\n\r\nnational  taxes or 23 per cent of the total  revenue\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. We have agreed to 40 per cent because\r\n\r\nof  the importance of the 8th of July and because we\r\n\r\nwanted to make a concession in view of the fact that\r\n\r\nthe   Common  Market  was  agreed  to  be   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. But after 31st December,  1964,  there\r\n\r\nwill be a review and what is important is this: that\r\n\r\nalthough  we may be only a State Government,  if  in\r\n\r\nthe  review  we  do not agree, then  an  independent\r\n\r\nassessor has to be appointed. And if we do not agree\r\n\r\non  the assessor, then it must come from a panel  of\r\n\r\npersons put forward by the World Bank. So there  can\r\n\r\nbe no question of bias in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this particular point for\r\n\r\nthe information of Members because one of the points\r\n\r\nmade by the Opposition is that we have given away  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  money which is quite untrue. Three-quarters\r\n\r\nof  what  we  have  given  away  will  be  spent  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  itself, which we  are  now  spending  in\r\n\r\nSingapore       - Police,      Prisons,       S.I.R.,\r\n\r\nTelecommunications,  Civil Aviation,  Meteorological\r\n\r\nOffice,  and  the extra one-quarter is for  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  and defence expenditure which we now  have\r\n\r\nto  incur because we are part of the Federation.  We\r\n\r\nalso  pay  part of foreign affairs which we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave now, and part of Parliament, the 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseats   which   will  be  warmed  in   the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament;  somebody has to  pay  for  the  leather\r\n\r\nbeing worn out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of movement, I mentioned this yesterday,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir.  This  is  another   important\r\n\r\nprovision at page 42, section 60 (1) . You will  find\r\n\r\nthat  in  sub-section (3), we  are  adding  in  this\r\n\r\namendment now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any such restriction shall apply reciprocally to\r\n\r\nthe States of Malaya and the State of Singapore'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should really be in \"the States of Malaysia\". I\r\n\r\nthink the draftsman has forgotten this. It should be\r\n\r\nthe  States of Malaysia. We may not wish to take any\r\n\r\nperson  from  Malaya and I have already mentioned  a\r\n\r\nfew  of  the gentlemen who used to give us a lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble. There are two types - political undesirables\r\n\r\nand  secret society elements. We have the  right  to\r\n\r\nrequest  that  such  a person shall  not  enter  our\r\n\r\nState,  just as the Federation will have - I  saw  in\r\n\r\nthe   newspaper   today  someone  mentioned   \"Sheik\r\n\r\nAzahari\".  It was not Sheik Azahari I had  in  mind.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  had  in  mind was Said Zahari,  the  former\r\n\r\neditor of Utusan Melayu, who is a Singapore citizen.\r\n\r\nHe   came  back  to  Singapore  and  he  found   the\r\n\r\nFederation causeway blocked against him and he never\r\n\r\nwent  back. Well, in the same way, we have  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of gentlemen, Mr Speaker, Sir, who  do  not\r\n\r\nadd much to the prosperity of Singapore and, who, in\r\n\r\nfact,  increase the general police expenditure,  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. expenditure of Singapore. They can  well  be\r\n\r\nlooked after by the State from where they came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;House of Representatives, 15 seats, page 13,\r\n\r\nArticle  9.  Judicial and Legal  Service,  page  37,\r\n\r\nArticle  54  (3);  appointment of judges,  page  17,\r\n\r\nArticle 17. Then, languages. In this Assembly  (page\r\n\r\n46)  it  will continue as it is, which is the  point\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the  other side from  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nought   to  remember.  If  the  country  had  chosen\r\n\r\nAlternative  B, complete merger, they would  all  be\r\n\r\ndisqualified even from this Assembly because many of\r\n\r\nthem  cannot speak English or Malay, even after four\r\n\r\nyears of free tuition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of \"Malays\" will now include\r\n\r\nMalays  born  in Singapore, and that is included  in\r\n\r\npage 77, right at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bottom - Article 160 (interpretation). It  means\r\n\r\nreally that all the special privileges which a Malay\r\n\r\ncan  get  in  Malaya will now be  available  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays  born in Singapore. I would like to make  the\r\n\r\npoint  that in Singapore the position remains as  it\r\n\r\nis.  In  other words, there is no ratio for licences\r\n\r\nor  other profits, Government patronage and jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service on the basis of race. We  believe\r\n\r\nin  the principle of open competition that has  been\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Federation and it  will  continue\r\n\r\nafter Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim religion, page 137, section 6. The Agong\r\n\r\nwill be the Head of the Muslim religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturalisation to be with the concurrence of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, page 23, section 27 (7) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Permanent Secretaries and State Advocate-General to continue as they are, page 139, Articles\r\n\r\n18 and 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, police officers, page 56. Sir, may I pause\r\n\r\nwith  police officers? There is a certain amount  of\r\n\r\ndisquiet. I have had to discuss this matter with the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister in the  Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Internal Security because there is some\r\n\r\nunhappiness at the contemplation of the police  here\r\n\r\nlosing  their  present salary scales  on  promotion.\r\n\r\nWhat  it provides therefore is that no person  shall\r\n\r\nlose  anything after Malaysia. Sir, I am  advised  - and  Members will have seen my letter to  Tun  Razak\r\n\r\nand Dr Ismail, and they have agreed to confirm this\r\n\r\nin  a letter - that nobody will lose. The problem is,\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  on promotion? Grade  for  grade,  the\r\n\r\nFederation pay is slightly less than ours. According\r\n\r\nto   some  officers,  it  is  appreciably  less.  My\r\n\r\nofficials,  my  Permanent Secretary  and  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, advise me that section 85 (2)   (a) \r\n\r\n\"shall be employed on terms and conditions not  less\r\n\r\nfavourable  than those applicable to him immediately\r\n\r\nbefore   Malaysia  Day\"  means  that  his  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects also cannot be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to press this matter too hard on\r\n\r\nthese  matters which have been agreed, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out that what may happen will be that\r\n\r\nif  the  Police Force insists on that  and  gets  an\r\n\r\ninterpretation of this Section by the Federal Court,\r\n\r\nvery few promotions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  new  designations  may be created.  One  problem\r\n\r\nwould  be, supposing the establishment were  reduced\r\n\r\nfor  each  of  the grades and then  new  grades  are\r\n\r\ncreated,  something, something Pegawais  instead  of\r\n\r\nA.S.P., is put on the Federation post. Therefore, my\r\n\r\npoint  is  that it is not profitable to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nlegal  argument to the end. They may  well  win  the\r\n\r\nlegal argument. I can see the merit of the argument.\r\n\r\nBut  it is much better to go on the substance of the\r\n\r\ncase.  We are paying to the Federation the full  sum\r\n\r\nof money we are paying the police; that is included.\r\n\r\nWe are paying a sum of money with projections on the\r\n\r\nbasis   of  present  salary  scales.  That  is   the\r\n\r\nimportant  point, Mr Speaker, Sir.  Projections  on\r\n\r\npresent  salary scales. In other words, if they  cut\r\n\r\ndown salaries on promotion, then our contribution to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will go down. If they do that,  then\r\n\r\nwe  must  press for it on the review on 1st January,\r\n\r\n1965.  I cannot hind the future government, but  for\r\n\r\nmyself I will be trying to press that very hard  and\r\n\r\ntake  the  savings from that and give  allowance  to\r\n\r\nofficers  serving in Singapore. We are  doing  that,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, in the case of  the  Judges.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we are doing more than that in the case of the\r\n\r\nJudges.  There  will  be a Bill  put  through  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate   of  Urgency  to  settle  the   Judges'\r\n\r\nsalaries and that of the State Advocate-General. You\r\n\r\nwill find it in my letter to Tun Razak. They will go\r\n\r\non  to the Federation Judges' basic, which is higher\r\n\r\nthan  ours. But for the present officers, that  will\r\n\r\nmean  they will lose in the allowance from  $400  to\r\n\r\n$120.  So  the State will make up the difference  of\r\n\r\n$280,  and other perks will be carried on the  State\r\n\r\nBudget.  In  other words, the Judges  will  get  the\r\n\r\nbenefit.  We are paying the Federation the full  sum\r\n\r\nof  money  which they will have to pay  our  Judges;\r\n\r\nthat  is included in the 40 per cent. And on review,\r\n\r\nthat will also be taken into account. They will have\r\n\r\nto  pay  the Judges. The lawyers will appear on  the\r\n\r\nState  budget, I think. We will carry over and above\r\n\r\nthat  the sum of $280 to make tip for the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  should not lose the allowance. It is,  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  a  fair and reasonable solution to  what  is\r\n\r\nafter all a difficult establishment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like once again to make the position clear\r\n\r\nto  the  Police Force - and this applies also to  the\r\n\r\nArmy  - that nobody will lose anything; and  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  they have a very strong case to take the  total\r\n\r\ngross take-home pay, even on promotion, as what they\r\n\r\nhave  today, because we are paying for it.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  argument is invincible. There is no gain-saying\r\n\r\nthe  fact that since we pay for it, we ought to  get\r\n\r\nit. The standard of living in Singapore is high, and\r\n\r\nthat  is that. I think it is unconscionable for  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government to make the State Government  pay\r\n\r\nwhat  it is now paying and then to reduce the salary\r\n\r\nand  keep the balance. I am quite sure that  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Federation Government. I would\r\n\r\nlike to give the police officers the assurance of my\r\n\r\nGovernment that we shall try and resolve this  in  a\r\n\r\nway  which  will be conducive to a unified Malaysian\r\n\r\nPolice  Force.  There are problems  of  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, because if the Malayan and the Borneo\r\n\r\npolice  were  to  come up to our level,  then  their\r\n\r\nbudgets  will really go up very high, because  their\r\n\r\nscales, particularly those in Borneo, are much lower\r\n\r\nthan  ours. But then their cost of living  is  lower\r\n\r\nthan ours - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But\r\n\r\nas against that is the clause that there shall be no\r\n\r\nreservation  for Malays in accordance  with  Article\r\n\r\n153  of positions in the public service to be filled\r\n\r\nby   recruitment  in  Singapore  or  of  permits  or\r\n\r\nlicences  for the operation of any trade or business\r\n\r\nin  Singapore; in other words, free competition into\r\n\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress this point, \"to be filled by\r\n\r\nrecruitment  in  Singapore\" includes  posts  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  service  recruited in Singapore.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,   the   Police  Commissioner  for   instance,\r\n\r\nrecruiting policemen in Singapore will not be  bound\r\n\r\nby  any  four  to one ratio. They are  posts  to  be\r\n\r\nrecruited in Singapore and there is no question of a\r\n\r\nfour to one ratio being applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Even in the Federal service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Even in the Federal service. If\r\n\r\nthe  post  is  recruited in Singapore, even  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal service there will be no restriction. Let us\r\n\r\nassume,    for    instance,    the    Director    of\r\n\r\nTelecommunications,  recruiting  several   technical\r\n\r\nassistants; then the Director of Telecommunications,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  recruiting  in  Singapore  will  recruit\r\n\r\nregardless of race. In other words, opportunities on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  free competition, with  the  special\r\n\r\nposition  of Malays in education, Malay settlements.\r\n\r\nIf  they  want business licences, then I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthey  will have to go to Johore or some other State,\r\n\r\nbecause that has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreed  with  the  Federation Government  that  that\r\n\r\nshall be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General - page 139 of Paper\r\n\r\nCommand 22 of 1963, Article 18 to 19. Secondment  or\r\n\r\nvoluntary transfer - page 167, Article 102. Sir,  the\r\n\r\npoint here is that the position of any person who is\r\n\r\nseconded  to  the  general  public  service  or  the\r\n\r\nJudicial and Legal Service of the Federation, as the\r\n\r\ncase  may  be, is safeguarded here.

I think that is as it should be,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  stable  governments between elections.  For\r\n\r\nfive  years  between elections,  there  is  no  more\r\n\r\nmusical  chairs  in this Assembly.

I was  mistaken.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,It is in Hansard, Vol.  20,  No.  2,\r\n\r\nFriday. 5th of April, column 25. \"Progress Report of\r\n\r\nConstitutional   provisions   for    Singapore    in\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaysia in  accordance  with  White\r\n\r\nPaper Cmd. 33 of 1961\". It reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another point is the spelling out of State\r\n\r\nautonomy  with  the  consequential  provision   that\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizens who are also Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncannot  have double enjoyment of both State autonomy\r\n\r\nin matters like education and labour and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  have  full enjoyment of education  and  labour\r\n\r\nrights in the other State.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  section  which I am quite sure the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  is  going to raise a hue and cry about  is  a\r\n\r\nreciprocal section. In other words, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat we will exercise these rights, but it does mean\r\n\r\nthat if either the Federation of Malaya or Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  free secondary or - let us say for the  sake  of\r\n\r\nargument  - free university education, we could  stop\r\n\r\nstudents  from the other side coming over. Similarly\r\n\r\nwith  the  factories, we could,  if  we  wanted  to,\r\n\r\nrestrict  the  factories  to  employment   of   only\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens.  This  is  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition. I do not think in the long run that it  is\r\n\r\nconducive to a united federation to do this. We have\r\n\r\ndone this, because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories have sought to keep  our  labour\r\n\r\nout for the time being. H is a concession we have to\r\n\r\nmake  to  them, because there is a genuine  fear  in\r\n\r\nSabah  and Sarawak that they will be overwhelmed  by\r\n\r\nmore  energetic and more sophisticated  technicians,\r\n\r\nmerchants and bankers, and so they have put in  this\r\n\r\nprovision.  Therefore  we  have  also  put  in  this\r\n\r\nprovision  purely  as  a  reciprocal  safeguard  and\r\n\r\nultimately I think as a bargaining counter. If  they\r\n\r\nput  their fences down, we will put our fences down.\r\n\r\nTo   give  a  simple  illustration,  there   is   no\r\n\r\nuniversity in Borneo and they will either have to go\r\n\r\nabroad   on  Colombo  Plan  scholarships   or   seek\r\n\r\nadmission  to the University of Singapore  which  is\r\n\r\nnearer  than  the University of Malaya  in  K.L.  We\r\n\r\naccept  them in the Polytechnic, the University  and\r\n\r\nall  the  technical  schools as  a  rule.  Even  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University has Borneo and Sarawak  students\r\n\r\nand  we  would  like to continue that practice.  But\r\n\r\nconstitutionally speaking, as long as  they  have  a\r\n\r\nfence  up against our workers going there; in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  so  long  as  there is a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\nexclusiveness on their side and, for that matter, on\r\n\r\nthe  Federation side, so we must have the  right  to\r\n\r\nexclude  if  we wish. I emphasise that in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun, these barriers must go. As the Federation grows\r\n\r\nin  unity, particularly under the threat of external\r\n\r\npressures,  it is inevitable that we will  all  grow\r\n\r\ncloser to one another, because our problems are  the\r\n\r\nsame.  We share a common fate, and the chances  are.\r\n\r\nif  one  part of the Federation goes under, so  will\r\n\r\nthe others. But I would like to make this point.  It\r\n\r\nhas  often been referred to by the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  and also the Member for Anson has taken  up\r\n\r\nthe cry of second-class citizens. I say in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nfar  from  being second-class citizens, I  would  be\r\n\r\nproud  to  be  a  Singapore citizen.  And  it  is  a\r\n\r\nprivilege  to  be a Singapore citizen,  because  you\r\n\r\nhave  public housing which you do not have in  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  Malaysia  to the same  extent,  you  have\r\n\r\neducational  facilities  which  you  have  not   got\r\n\r\nanywhere  else in Malaysia, and the possibility,  if\r\n\r\nour  rate of growth is maintained, of free secondary\r\n\r\neducation for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverybody  - not just for Malays - by the third  year,\r\n\r\nby any Government which comes into office. The money\r\n\r\nis  there, the expansion is there; and the right  to\r\n\r\nsocial   welfare  benefits  - unemployment  benefits.\r\n\r\nThese  are  privileges accorded  only  to  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens of Malaysia, not to Malaysian citizens  who\r\n\r\nare  not  Singapore citizens. As  against  that,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are the prohibitions that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nvote in the Federation nor can they vote here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was attracted, Mr Speaker, by an argument put\r\n\r\nforward  at  the  Prime  Ministers'  Conference   in\r\n\r\nSeptember  last  year, and whilst we  all  make  our\r\n\r\nbargaining positions as strong as possible, we  have\r\n\r\nat  the  same time to look at the future  where  our\r\n\r\ndestinies converge. And one Prime Minister  - a  very\r\n\r\nable  speaker  - said he was against Britain  joining\r\n\r\nthe Common Market. He was from one of those European\r\n\r\ndominions.  He  said that if Britain  joined  Europe\r\n\r\nthen  it  was sheer humbug to say - well, he did  not\r\n\r\nactually use the word \"humbug\", but he said it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  pure pretence to say that it would not really\r\n\r\nbecome  slowly  part of the political structure  and\r\n\r\neventually  the  military structure of  Europe.  Its\r\n\r\nalready  military structure had become  an  economic\r\n\r\nand  political union. He said in his experience  -he\r\n\r\nhas got experience of federal constitutions and as a\r\n\r\nstudent  of history - \"A federation goes one  of  two\r\n\r\nways:   either   the   force   is   centrifugal   or\r\n\r\ncentripetal.  In other words, either  the  bits  and\r\n\r\npieces  break  up  or they come  closer  and  closer\r\n\r\ntogether.  I cannot envisage Malaysia splitting  up.\r\n\r\nIt  must come closer and closer together. It must be\r\n\r\ncentripetal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless we should have every bargaining\r\n\r\ncounter. Charity is a desirable characteristic  but,\r\n\r\nin  these circumstances, it is a luxury for  us.  We\r\n\r\nlike to be generous to the rest of Malaysia and  you\r\n\r\nwill  see  from  the  exchange of  letters  that  we\r\n\r\noffered  two  per cent of our national  taxes,  both\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax and Excise, as a component part  of  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  index for Common Market. It  is  not  an\r\n\r\namount  to be despised - two per cent, three per  cent\r\n\r\n- it  is  $6,000,000 now; it will grow to $12,000,000\r\n\r\nin five\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears'  time and $20,000,000 in ten years' time.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution is written out, in so far as human\r\n\r\ningenuity  can provide in legal documents,  all  the\r\n\r\nsafeguards and all the bargaining counters.  We  had\r\n\r\nquite  an  ingenious team on our side, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, with sharp intellects. We had the smallest team\r\n\r\nin  London,  two Ministers, against the Federation's\r\n\r\nsix:  even Sarawak came with a delegation of  seven.\r\n\r\nSeven  chaps, seven honourable gentlemen signed  the\r\n\r\ndocument. North Borneo -  six. But there were only two\r\n\r\nof  us.  And our officials were only five,  plus  my\r\n\r\npersonal  secretary  who  acted  as  secretary   and\r\n\r\nstenographer.  But I would say there was  no  point,\r\n\r\nnot  even  half a point, which we unwittingly  threw\r\n\r\naway.  If we gave away a point, it was because there\r\n\r\nwas some concession, some generosity of approach  on\r\n\r\nthe other side. I would not like to pretend that  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  otherwise. It would be dishonest  because\r\n\r\nthe  letters  clearly  show, and  I  am  afraid  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  certain gentlemen in Kuala  Lumpur  in\r\n\r\nhigh places continues to show, a degree of aloofness\r\n\r\nand lack of understanding of our problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot govern Singapore on the basis that it is\r\n\r\na  small State and that you can squat on it. This is\r\n\r\nthe  vital heart of a throbbing region, a region  in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of flux and turmoil and revolution.  This\r\n\r\nis  the centre - a big market-place, and now with the\r\n\r\nCommon Market, the industrial base. Nothing can take\r\n\r\naway  our  natural harbour, our airport, the  Jurong\r\n\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if Members have read hard-headed\r\n\r\nbusinessmen's appraisal of Singapore after Malaysia.\r\n\r\nShare prices, land prices, land values bear it  out.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Farrer Park will know. There  is  no\r\n\r\ngainsaying  this. And we are prepared to  share  all\r\n\r\nthis  with  Malaysia  provided  gradually  over  the\r\n\r\nyears, as we throw more into the common pool, so our\r\n\r\nvoice  in  national matters must increase. That  is,\r\n\r\nthe   gradual  process.  On  certain  matters,  like\r\n\r\neducation, it will be difficult - for 50 years, maybe\r\n\r\neven  more  - to  quite  fit in with  the  Federation\r\n\r\npattern  or,  for  that  matters,  with  the  Borneo\r\n\r\npattern.  It  is  one  of  those  things  that  have\r\n\r\nhappened in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  British made a decision in 1945 to separate  us\r\n\r\nwithout  knowing  the immeasurable  consequences  of\r\n\r\nthat act which led to a whole series of events which\r\n\r\nculminated  in  riots, strikes, civil  disobedience,\r\n\r\nand only ended - I mean, really we turned the tide on\r\n\r\neducation  when the boycott failed. Sometime  before\r\n\r\nthat  we convinced the Chinese that nobody was going\r\n\r\nto   kill   Chinese  education,   let   alone   this\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Member for Queenstown has a  son  in\r\n\r\nan   English   school,  whilst   the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  for  Education  has  his  children  in  a\r\n\r\nChinese school. How could it be? There is no  answer\r\n\r\nto  that. There can be none. And so I say, far  from\r\n\r\nbeing ashamed of being a Singapore citizen, it is  a\r\n\r\nprize  to be gained in Malaysia, one which  we  will\r\n\r\nnot lightly give away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the financial arrangements, I want to make\r\n\r\nthree points. First, about the entrep\ufffdt trade. There\r\n\r\nwill  be a lot more talk of selling away the  birth-right   of  Singapore  and  all  the  rest  of   it,\r\n\r\nparticularly  from the Member for  Anson  -  he  has\r\n\r\nalready shot that line; it will be difficult for him\r\n\r\nto  retract. Apart from eight competent expert minds\r\n\r\nfrom the World Bank, having been brought to bear  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter, I would like to add this: that our  own\r\n\r\nteam  in the Economic Development Board - for  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  embark on something on the basis of a guess,  a\r\n\r\nleap  into  the  dark. That is not  the  way  we  do\r\n\r\nthings. It has been carefully worked out. Two-thirds\r\n\r\nof  our entrep\ufffdt trade is on primary products,  like\r\n\r\nrubber,  copra,  pepper, coffee. And  the  principal\r\n\r\nmarkets for these products lie outside Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will look at the exchange of documents,\r\n\r\nthere  is one signed by the Finance Minister of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  It is on the fourth page  - letter  from\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister.  The third  letter.  \"Common\r\n\r\nMarket.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government undertakes not to impose\r\n\r\nexport  duties  in Singapore in respect  of  primary\r\n\r\nproducts, other than minerals including oil produced\r\n\r\nin Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, on our present statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  of  our  entrep\ufffdt  trade  is  unaffected\r\n\r\n- rubber, copra, pepper, coffee. They will go  on  as\r\n\r\nusual.  No need for bonded warehousing and the  rest\r\n\r\nof  it.  Bonded warehousing comes in in the case  of\r\n\r\ntyres,  by  way  of example, if and when  tyres  are\r\n\r\nmanufactured. Tyres are now n1anufactured  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  I have not the slightest doubt that Dunlops\r\n\r\nwill apply for protection in the Common Market. Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is another point that I would like to make.  We\r\n\r\nmay  be  one-fourteenth of Malaysia, but we have  40\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the purchasing power of the  total  as\r\n\r\nagainst 60 per cent in Malaya. Purchasing power. Any\r\n\r\nadvertiser of consumer goods can confirm that. It is\r\n\r\nborne  out by the statistics, the sales - radio  sets,\r\n\r\ntransistors, nearly 100 per cent of T.V., apart from\r\n\r\nJohore  not  paying for licences  hut  getting  free\r\n\r\nentertainment from Singapore. I would say we have  a\r\n\r\nstrong   bargaining  position,  and  we  intend   to\r\n\r\nexercise it. Let us say tyres are included.  Once  a\r\n\r\ncommodity  is protected, then it can be manufactured\r\n\r\nanywhere  in Malaysia. The protection is not  for  a\r\n\r\nparticular  factory, but for a particular commodity,\r\n\r\nand  `or  that reason Bridgestone is opening  up  in\r\n\r\nJurong.  That is as it should be. If, in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nproximity of rubber estates to Dunlop factory  makes\r\n\r\na  difference in cost as against taking rubber  from\r\n\r\nSouth  Johore  to  Jurong, then  Dunlops  will  beat\r\n\r\nBridgestone.  If  it  is  not,  then  in   the   end\r\n\r\nBridgestone  will  sell probably  in  South  Malaya.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Borneo, because  it  is  cheaper  to\r\n\r\nexport  tyres  from here to Borneo than  from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  by  rail  - Klang to Kuala  Lumpur,  down  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   by   ship,  handling  charges, freight\r\n\r\ncharges,   and  so  on.  This  is  a   point   worth\r\n\r\nremembering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Customs, Excise and Income Tax will remain\r\n\r\nState Departments. In other words, we ourselves  can\r\n\r\nensure that there will be as little inconvenience as\r\n\r\npossible caused to the commercial community. This is\r\n\r\ncovered  in Article 5 of Annex G. Sir, if  one  will\r\n\r\nlook at the financial arrangements, one will see  In\r\n\r\nthe  ultimatum at page 61 - I do not think it was  an\r\n\r\nultimatum, Mr Speaker. Sir; it was somebody in  the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry who lost his temper and decided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  write a tough letter, requesting a reply  within\r\n\r\n48  hours  - \"Powers to be reserved  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment:  The  power  to  prohibit  imports   and\r\n\r\nexports  of any class of goods;\". Sir, we could  not\r\n\r\nagree   to   that  because  it  means  putting   our\r\n\r\nlifeblood,  our trade, into the hands of  a  Federal\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  who may not be  as  sensitive  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  as we are.  For  instance,  they\r\n\r\nbanned  South  African goods. I do  not  approve  of\r\n\r\nSouth Africa and apartheid. But it is very difficult\r\n\r\nwhen  a ship comes in - you are a big port - and, say,\r\n\r\npart  of the cargo is South African and so you  will\r\n\r\nnot  work the cargo, for political reasons, to  show\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  the struggle of the  African  people.\r\n\r\nThat  has been done in the Federation. We share that\r\n\r\nsympathy,  but  we  are sufficiently  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nrealities,  the practical difficulties, n  which  it\r\n\r\nwill  involve us. Therefore, we are not a  party  to\r\n\r\nthat. That means we will go on as we are. That is  a\r\n\r\npoint  worth  remembering, Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Also\r\n\r\nChinese  textiles have been banned in the Federation\r\n\r\nfor  various reasons. I do not think we want to  get\r\n\r\ncommitted  to these policies. We are a  big  trading\r\n\r\narea.  We trade in the world's goods, with the  rest\r\n\r\nof  the world. And that way, is the best way for all\r\n\r\nof  us.  And now this power cannot be exercised.  If\r\n\r\none  were to look at Annex G, Members will see  that\r\n\r\nit  is  only  with  the  consent  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment that this power can be exercised. So when\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill says it is all  bogus,  he\r\n\r\nmust have been unaware of these difficulties. He  is\r\n\r\nprobably  either  not in the inner conclave  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  in  Kuala Lumpur, or perhaps he  was  just\r\n\r\nshooting  an  election  line.  There  were   serious\r\n\r\ndifferences   which   - very   fortunately   patient,\r\n\r\nprolonged - sometimes tortuous, sometimes bitter - but\r\n\r\nalways    determined   negotiations   - provided    a\r\n\r\nconclusion in the end, a successful solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the other point is this: unlike the\r\n\r\nFederation,  the  law  on foreign  banks  - owned  by\r\n\r\nforeign   nations  - will  not  apply.   Banking   is\r\n\r\nconcurrent.  Prohibition in the  Federation  on  the\r\n\r\nBank  of  Indonesia, Bank Negara, and  the  Bank  of\r\n\r\nChina - will not apply in Singapore. We will continue\r\n\r\nas we are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity at this\r\n\r\nlast sitting of the Assembly, with these powers  - as\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  when  we meet  again,  I  will  have\r\n\r\ndischarged  my responsibilities, I hope,  completely\r\n\r\nand successfully, without a blot on my copybook.  No\r\n\r\nriots,  no  revolution, no  arson.  30  days  to  go\r\n\r\n- actually  29 because the 31st August is  no  longer\r\n\r\nour  responsibility, but nevertheless we will always\r\n\r\ndo  our best to ensure - and the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas  valuable experience in these matters  - to  give\r\n\r\nadvice  if  it is sought by the Minister responsible\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation. We would not like to shirk  our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities because if through insensitivity or\r\n\r\nother  reasons  some wrong policy  were  instituted,\r\n\r\nthen we in Singapore and Malaysia would all suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compare the end of our first term\r\n\r\nof  office with that of the last Government  led  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson and the Member for Cairnhill. I\r\n\r\nhear  the Member for Cairnhill is raring for  blood,\r\n\r\ncoming  in  for the kill, finishing off  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, whether he does or whether he  does\r\n\r\nnot,  whether we are returned in the next  elections\r\n\r\nto be held sometime before the end of the year, even\r\n\r\nthough  we  have the right to go on till March  next\r\n\r\nyear,  I  give  an  undertaking that  we  will  have\r\n\r\nelections  before that, as I think  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill wants it. That was one of the reasons  why\r\n\r\nhe  postponed the 15 seats in order that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  accommodation made, so there will  be  a  better\r\n\r\nchance for the Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I have been accused of arrogance,\r\n\r\nineptitude,  stupidities. Sir, whatever our  faults,\r\n\r\nwe leave the country at the end of our first term of\r\n\r\noffice  in  a  healthier state  than  we  came  into\r\n\r\noffice. The last days of the last Government  was  a\r\n\r\npathetic  sight.  I have read of the  last  days  of\r\n\r\nNanking before the Kuomintang fled - papers strewn on\r\n\r\nthe  office floor, Ministers packing away gold bars,\r\n\r\nsecretaries packing away valuable furniture  to  fly\r\n\r\nout  to  Canton, then to Taiwan, and  there  was  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  decay.  This  was  a  newspaperman's\r\n\r\naccount  of what took place in Nanking. And  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  year,  particularly the last few months,  that\r\n\r\nwas the state of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  and the Government and the officers.  Morale\r\n\r\nhad  collapsed.  It was a Government  that  was  only\r\n\r\ninterested  in its own survival. When we  took  over,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I had no office; no provision  had\r\n\r\nbeen  made  for  an office. That is a  fact.  It  was\r\n\r\nagreed already before the Chief Minister went out  of\r\n\r\noffice  that he would vacate his office and  give  it\r\n\r\nhack  to  the Assembly, and I took office without  an\r\n\r\noffice  having been prepared. The then Chief Minister\r\n\r\nnever  expected to be returned; so he did not  bother\r\n\r\nabout  it.  Why  worry about the stationery  and  the\r\n\r\noffice?  But I say, Sir, whoever takes over from  us,\r\n\r\nwe will give a full inventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are proud men, because we are proud to do\r\n\r\nthe  decent thing by the country. We have brought  it\r\n\r\nto  security  and  we have brought it  into  harbour.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens, the ship is safe and sound, and the\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the other side, particularly  the  three\r\n\r\nMembers  in  U.M.N.O.,  know  that.  Whoever  assumes\r\n\r\noffice after the elections will find $400 million  in\r\n\r\nthe  kitty which was not there, will find development\r\n\r\nplans  which  will carry on: it has a  momentum  that\r\n\r\nwill  carry on into the first three years of the next\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  United Nations team  on  urban  re-development  is enthusiastic over our prospects  - the\r\n\r\nfinances,  the  revenue  and  the  possibilities   of\r\n\r\nrebuilding.  Plans  are afoot to  knock  down  Outram\r\n\r\nPrison  in spite of the difficulties about the  Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang riots; and they will proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came in and found things at a standstill. The\r\n\r\nformer Financial Secretary was an expatriate. He  had\r\n\r\ndecided that the time had come for him to retire  and\r\n\r\nhe  left.  There were no plans in hand for  anything:\r\n\r\nthere was very little money left in the kitty either.\r\n\r\nAmongst  other things, if ever, if it is the will  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, so be it; let some other government take\r\n\r\nover  if  it  can do better; but it will  find  every\r\n\r\noffice  in  every Ministry ticking. In  my  Ministry,\r\n\r\nSir, it will find that there are two typists who know\r\n\r\nhow  to  do  Japanese  flower  arrangements  - a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  factor.  It  shows  that  somebody  cares.\r\n\r\nFlowers are being grown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the Botanic Gardens; a car comes down on its  way\r\n\r\nto  pick  me  to  office and picks  up  the  flowers.\r\n\r\nSomebody  in the office gets a $10 allowance  to  put\r\n\r\nthe flowers and arrange them nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Oh, I did not know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, the Finance Minister does\r\n\r\nnot know it, Sir,It is out of the miscellaneous -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I  have\r\n\r\ntwice  answered this question in the last  few  days,\r\n\r\nand  I  was intrigued to see the Member for Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  trying to cause trouble with the Tunku.  He  is\r\n\r\nvery  good in this, Mr Speaker, Sir,It is  all  set\r\n\r\nout: The Three Kingdoms is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  very good book to read - over 1,000 tales in which\r\n\r\nevery human situation imaginable and conceivable  is\r\n\r\nrecited and recorded. Treachery, cowardice, bravery,\r\n\r\nlove,  hatred,  trickery,  roguery,  rascality,  are\r\n\r\nrecounted  in the analects - over 1,000 of  them  - and\r\n\r\nthis  comes under \"How to cause trouble among people\r\n\r\nwho  are  against  you, cause  them  to  fight  each\r\n\r\nother.\"  Somebody  asked me - I cannot  remember  now\r\n\r\n- whether  I would be the Prime Minister of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  I  said,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we  are  realistic\r\n\r\nenough to acknowledge that in the foreseeable future\r\n\r\nthere  can  be no P.A.P. Prime Minister of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Choa Chu Kang still wants  to  try.\r\n\r\nThey  say among the P.A.P. members, the cadres, when\r\n\r\nthey  meet,  \"Ah, do not worry; in 10 or  15  years'\r\n\r\ntime the Tunku will be out. I will take over. I will\r\n\r\nbe  the  Prime Minister of Malaysia.\" Sir, I do  not\r\n\r\nknow about what will happen in 10 or 15 years' time.\r\n\r\nI  hope  we  will  be a united people  and  a  still\r\n\r\nprosperous  and developing society, and I  would  be\r\n\r\nashamed  of  myself if I did not make a contribution\r\n\r\nin  that society. I would say that he is a fool  who\r\n\r\nbelieves  that  he can govern Ma1aysia  without  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the Malays. I can envisage the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\na  Government of Malaysia at some date in the future\r\n\r\nworking  in  conjunction with Malay leaders,  but  I\r\n\r\ncannot imagine a Singapore P.A.P. spreading out only\r\n\r\ninto  the towns and capturing the majority of  seats\r\n\r\nand controlling the destiny of Malaysia. That is not\r\n\r\npossible, and I will explain why, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWhatever   the  Tunku  may  be  to  the   Communists\r\n\r\n- although  he is, in many ways, straightforward  and\r\n\r\nhe  prefers the simple approach - he is a realist and\r\n\r\nunderstands the mechanics of power. That is why when\r\n\r\nhe  met my two other colleagues and we discussed the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, he said, \"Look, I want the Police, Army\r\n\r\nand \"Prisons.\" [Interruption] This is not a laughing\r\n\r\nmatter.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  He  understands   the\r\n\r\nmechanics of power and, brought up in the shadow  of\r\n\r\nthe  throne of Kedah, he knows how to govern,  which\r\n\r\nwas  something the Member for Anson never knew.  The\r\n\r\nMember  was  chased from pillar to post; he  changed\r\n\r\nhis mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  five seconds. When the Tunku says,  \"No\",  it\r\n\r\nwill  take a long time to get him to say, \"Yes\",  as\r\n\r\nit  took  us. In 1955, we wanted merger;  we  waited\r\n\r\nuntil 1963 before we got merger. He meant \"No\" for a\r\n\r\nvery   long  time.  It  was  only  because  of   the\r\n\r\ninevitability  of  it, the awful alternative  of  no\r\n\r\nmerger  leading to what he himself said North versus\r\n\r\nSouth,  that we got merger by consent: otherwise  we\r\n\r\nwould have merger by force; it must be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have an army and the Police, and what is more\r\n\r\nan  Administration.  In  Singapore,  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\ncompletely free for all administration. But we  must\r\n\r\nbe  realistic  enough  to realise  that  no  Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernment can ever carry its people, if it abandons\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the immediate future  a  four  to  one\r\n\r\npolicy on the key jobs. In other words, even if by a\r\n\r\nfluke,  by  some  chance, a  wrong  distribution  of\r\n\r\nseats,  one Party won the majority of seats  in  the\r\n\r\nParliament,  do  they  think they  will  govern  the\r\n\r\ncountry?  The Administration is solid; the  Army  is\r\n\r\nsolid,  the  Police  is solid. There  is  the  Agong\r\n\r\n- symbol  of the monarch. It has happened  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld  over,  Mr Speaker, Sir. Ayub Khan  moved  in\r\n\r\nfrom  Field Marshal; he was General, then he  became\r\n\r\nField  Marshal, and he is now President. General  Ne\r\n\r\nWin,   President.  Nasser,  now  President,  was   a\r\n\r\ncolonel:  somewhere in some military  college  there\r\n\r\nmay  be a young Nasser. But I hope that that is  not\r\n\r\nthe  future  of  Malaysia. I  say  it  will  be  the\r\n\r\nstupidity  of the Chinese Communists in  Malaya  who\r\n\r\nwill make that happen, if ever it happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have our way, we will bring the people\r\n\r\ntogether  more  by exhortation and example  than  by\r\n\r\nforce,  because  force  is  not  possible  in   this\r\n\r\nsituation,  by persuasion, example, exhortation  and\r\n\r\nco-operation, and that is what we are out to do.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, we understand our strength. No Party\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia  after the first 10 years  when  a  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  grows up and all are Malaysian  citizens\r\n\r\n- not  now, now half are immigrants who do  not  have\r\n\r\ncitizenship in Malaya, and some in Borneo  too  have\r\n\r\nnot  got  citizenship; but nearly all  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave - in 10 years' time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe proportion, the distribution is such, the racial\r\n\r\ncomponents  are  such that no Party  can  govern  by\r\n\r\nrelying on only one race. The Chinese cannot  govern\r\n\r\njust  by Chinese votes. And I say it is so with  the\r\n\r\nMalays and with the Indians. There are about 41  per\r\n\r\ncent Chinese, 44 per cent Malays, Dyaks, Dusuns  and\r\n\r\nMuruts.  10  per cent Indians and so on.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  must be a partnership, or we will perish.  We\r\n\r\nwill  slit each other's throats. This is cold logic.\r\n\r\nIf  there is to be a partnership, it must be on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of equality. I cannot just find a Malay stooge\r\n\r\nand dub him as a Malay leader and say, Here you are,\r\n\r\nI  appoint you Prime Minister.\" I then shake him  by\r\n\r\nthe  hand and create him as a Malay leader. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible. And vice versa, Mr Speaker, Sir,In\r\n\r\nother words, you cannot have a tame Chinaman and say\r\n\r\nhe  represents the Chinese and shake him by the hand\r\n\r\nand  say, \"Here you are, your leader.\" That  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way  the Chinese are - just like the Malays.  By\r\n\r\ndefinition, a leader means he leads; he  fights  for\r\n\r\nthe nation and for the section of the community that\r\n\r\nhe represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, it has been my privilege to tight for\r\n\r\nthe just rights of Singapore in Malaysia. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  role to play in Malaysia, not  to  take\r\n\r\nover, hut to co-operate. We understand the mechanics\r\n\r\nof  power  too. We are also sufficiently  acquainted\r\n\r\nwith the respective power positions and the ploy  of\r\n\r\nmen in power. As long as the Tunku is there, he will\r\n\r\nhe  the  leader  of  Malaysia,  and  to  everybody's\r\n\r\nadvantage, because whatever one can say of  him,  he\r\n\r\nis not a communalist, which is a very great thing in\r\n\r\nthis country. If he were, and he tried to stymie  or\r\n\r\nobstruct  the activities of four million Chinese  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia out of ten million, then he would  go  down\r\n\r\nthe  drain,  just  like a few other countries  have.\r\n\r\nRiots  took  place recently in some countries.  They\r\n\r\nburned  Chinese lorries and shops; now  they  cannot\r\n\r\nget the vegetables from the country to the town; the\r\n\r\nprice of vegetables has gone up in the town, and the\r\n\r\nchaps  in  the  country have suffered  because  they\r\n\r\ncannot sell the vegetables. There is a great deal to\r\n\r\nkeep the people together. Whoever follows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim must find like-minded persons to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, the next generation will be\r\n\r\nbrought  up in the same schools and under  the  same\r\n\r\nconditions.  Then race will cease to  matter  as  we\r\n\r\nspeak one common language; we begin to feel one.  It\r\n\r\nmay not be in my lifetime, but I hope it will be  in\r\n\r\nthe one that follows me. But in my lifetime and that\r\n\r\nof  my  colleagues,  whatever happens,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nrunning  away  from  here. We  have  no  gold  mines\r\n\r\nstashed  away,  or  bullion stacked  into  suitcases\r\n\r\nready  to  climb into an aeroplane. If  the  country\r\n\r\nperishes, so will we. But what we are determined  to\r\n\r\nsee  is  that  it  does not perish,  either  through\r\n\r\nwickedness  by  those  who  manipulate  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, or through stupidity and greed, like  some\r\n\r\nwho  try  to  loot  and no doubt will  try  to  loot\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of pickings in Singapore. I am told\r\n\r\nthat  an  estimate of three million lottery  tickets\r\n\r\ncan  be  sold  every month. Just think  of  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir!  I  mean  you  and  I  tied  to   our\r\n\r\nemoluments  on  the  vote and here  they  can  print\r\n\r\nlottery  tickets. Through printing the tickets,  you\r\n\r\nmake  money.  They  estimate  they  can  sell  three\r\n\r\nmillion  tickets in Singapore alone; they have  been\r\n\r\nwatching the Turf Club. Through selling tickets, you\r\n\r\nmake  money. When chaps win prizes, they feel happy;\r\n\r\nthey give you a percentage; so definitely all round,\r\n\r\nyou win. There are other things too which they tried\r\n\r\nto  convert  and put into the centre: licences  - the\r\n\r\nlifeblood of Singapore - free trade, tenders and they\r\n\r\ndid not get it. They tried to. They sent a document,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir. They will not get it. And  I  say\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore will have  the  sense  to\r\n\r\nreject  them.  If they choose to elect a  Government\r\n\r\nthat  will do these things, then I say we  have  all\r\n\r\nlost  because that is the first step towards  chaos,\r\n\r\nanarchy,  a  military dictatorship followed  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists when all breaks down. It is our  duty  to\r\n\r\nkeep  it that way. In other words, what my colleague\r\n\r\nsaid  on  Sunday  when we went to  Siglap  together,\r\n\r\nthere are two things required of anyone who wants to\r\n\r\ninherit the right to spend this $400 million stashed\r\n\r\naway  for  the  country to carry  out  the  building\r\n\r\nplans,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe industrial projects in Jurong, nearly completed,\r\n\r\nharbour,  rail road, water and power.

For more than half an hour, he was\r\n\r\npraising   and   defending  the   British   colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment,  telling  us how Malaysia  is  not  neo-colonialist.  He knows how to talk. He  talks  about\r\n\r\nthe  electronic  machine, the  electronic  computer.\r\n\r\nYes, he talks of his own brilliance, forgetting  all\r\n\r\nthe  time that the British colonial Government  with\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  years' experience behind them  is  the\r\n\r\nreal  electronic computer in the whole  business  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister even went so far as to say that he had the British by the throat or by the neck. I remember reading in the newspapers that he said he almost got Mr Sandys down on his bended knees, or something to that effect. Yet what happened? Getting the British to go down on their bended knees, and yet he gives $150 million away! How does he work it\r\n\r\nout?  This is a new type of logic, P.A.P. logic,  to\r\n\r\nwhich we are now getting quite used to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks of his calculations, but all the time he\r\n\r\nforgets that it is British, the master mind, that is\r\n\r\nreally  directing operations behind the  scenes.  If\r\n\r\nonly  he will look at himself in the mirror, he will\r\n\r\nrealise  that he was merely being pushed  around  by\r\n\r\nthe British without himself knowing it. No wonder he\r\n\r\npays tribute to the British, because he knows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin actual fact that it is the British who are behind\r\n\r\nthe  whole  scheme.

Of course, the P.A.P., thinking\r\n\r\nonly  of  their  own selfish selves, began  to  link\r\n\r\ntheir  own  personal fortunes with  the  success  or\r\n\r\nfailure of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Assembly, Sir, the P.A.P. always put up a\r\n\r\nbold front when they are only 25 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thirty-eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister still talks\r\n\r\nas if he is the master of the whole situation.

Why\r\n\r\ncan  they  not say categorically, since  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, as Leader of the House, has said  in\r\n\r\nthis very House, that general elections will be held\r\n\r\nbefore the end of the year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you\r\n\r\nwill  remember, I said that general elections  would\r\n\r\nbe held after Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir, after Malaysia, but\r\n\r\nalso before the end of the year.

Of course, everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister, when he speaks in  any  of\r\n\r\nthese  rallies, makes sure that there is  already  a\r\n\r\ncrowd,  though that crowd is there not to listen  to\r\n\r\nhim  but  to see a show.

No, Sir,\r\n\r\nhe sat in his room eating sandwiches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Earlier on the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown started off by saying the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwas   posturing.  May  I  suggest  that  he  is  now\r\n\r\nposturing before this Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, while he talks of\r\n\r\nbiting his lips, being astounded, he was also merely\r\n\r\ntaking  sandwiches, taking whisky. He tells  us  all\r\n\r\nthis  and  then he ultimately surrendered.  Why?  He\r\n\r\nquotes Dr Faust, but I think he quoted wrongly.  He\r\n\r\nshould  have  quoted Machiavelli,  the  Prince.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance is very good at  quoting  the\r\n\r\nPrince.  He recommended that book to quite a  number\r\n\r\nof  people,  and  I also have read it.  I  am  daily\r\n\r\nlearning  of how the P.A.P. always puts  on  a  bold\r\n\r\nfront, stuff themselves with cotton wool -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - wherever it may be. You see,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  P.A.P. today  is  in  a  very  difficult\r\n\r\nposition.  In 1959 because of their good  posturing,\r\n\r\nbecause they managed to shout anti-colonial slogans,\r\n\r\nthey  had the support of the masses. After they  had\r\n\r\nclimbed into power they started to play the game  of\r\n\r\ntight-rope walking by playing on their line  of  so-called  indispensability. They  know  they  had  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the masses and they wanted to  tell  the\r\n\r\nLeft, \"Look boys, I am the only chap who can prevent\r\n\r\nyou  from being napped and therefore you jolly  well\r\n\r\nhelp  me.\"  But  that type of bluff  did  not  carry\r\n\r\nweight.  The P.A.P. was exposed and the support  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taken away from them. They are every day being\r\n\r\nexposed  and now they are completely naked in  every\r\n\r\nway.  Today  knowing  that they  do  not  have'  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the Left, they still want to walk along a\r\n\r\ntight  rope. How? This time, instead of  playing  on\r\n\r\nthe  Left, they play on the British. They  tell  the\r\n\r\nBritish  \"Look, the P.A.P. Ministers  are  the  only\r\n\r\npeople who can look after the Communists.\" They tell\r\n\r\nthe whole world they are better fighters against the\r\n\r\nCommunists then the ex-S.P.A. Government.  They  say\r\n\r\nthat  if the British want to contain the Communists,\r\n\r\nthey must keep the P.A.P. in power. And knowing that\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish  have  this phobia, they keep  playing  this\r\n\r\nphobia  on  their minds. Every time they  bring  out\r\n\r\nthis  bogey. Anything that they have done  badly  or\r\n\r\nwrongly,  they  put the blame on the Communists.  If\r\n\r\nthey  want to take some drastic action against their\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents,  again  they  label  them   as\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Under  those  circumstances,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  will not be able not to support them.  They\r\n\r\nsay,   \"Well,  since  you  are  going  against   the\r\n\r\nCommunists, we will therefore give you a  chance  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on.\"  The  P.A.P., realising  all  this,  can\r\n\r\ntherefore afford to act tough. Because they have the\r\n\r\nBritish  behind them, they therefore  dare  to  take\r\n\r\ntough  action.  If  they did not  have  the  British\r\n\r\nbehind them, they would have crumpled up. They would\r\n\r\nnot  dare do a thing. See what is happening to  this\r\n\r\nlands  affair.  The  Prime Minister  says  it  is  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  gain  and  a  prize  for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Is  that true? The letters  reveal  that\r\n\r\nthat  is not the case. I will come to that later  on\r\n\r\nin my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole policy of the P.A.P. has been based on\r\n\r\nthe calculation - no - miscalculation of the fact that\r\n\r\nthey  are indispensable. They always play one  force\r\n\r\nagainst  another and thereby hope to keep themselves\r\n\r\nin  office and enjoy all the facilities that go with\r\n\r\nthat office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this bit about Malaysia not being neo-colonialism. I will touch more on that a little\r\n\r\nlater,  but  all of us know that Article  6  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement is the essence of  Malaysia.  If\r\n\r\nthere  was no Article 6, there would be no Malaysia.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  after all is only the political aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe  British  Far East Unified Command which  covers\r\n\r\nexactly the same five areas in Malaysia. If they say\r\n\r\nthat it is not neo-colonialism, all they have to  do\r\n\r\nis  to  ask the British to walk out. They will  then\r\n\r\nsee  whether  or not there is Malaysia. The  British\r\n\r\nwill  not  only fight back but will also help  crush\r\n\r\nand knock the P.A.P. out. Realising this, of course,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. wants to play the game for the  British.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, even the United States is  now  coming\r\n\r\nout  openly  in  support of Malaysia  and  has  even\r\n\r\nthreatened,  as  I  see in the papers,  to  withdraw\r\n\r\nfinancial aid to Indonesia if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia  does  not stop the confrontation  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. always likes to use the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey  to frighten the people. They know that we  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are their main opponents. They\r\n\r\nhope by linking and identifying the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nwith  the Communists, they can use that as an excuse\r\n\r\nto  knock out the Barisan Sosialis. But as the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself too realises, they cannot knock out\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. They may gaol  some  of  us,\r\n\r\nbecause today they have State power in their  hands,\r\n\r\nbut  they  will  not be able to take away  the  real\r\n\r\nstrength of the Barisan Sosialis, because we  are  a\r\n\r\nParty,  unlike the P.A.P., that is really rooted  in\r\n\r\nthe  masses. Ask the P.A.P. to hold a rally anywhere\r\n\r\nand we hold a rally anywhere. We do not have to hire\r\n\r\nbuses to cart people there. The people will come and\r\n\r\nlisten  to us. If the P.A.P. were to hold a  similar\r\n\r\nrally,  they would not be able to have a  couple  of\r\n\r\nhundred  people  unless they gave  instructions  and\r\n\r\nspecific directions to the Work Brigade boys  to  be\r\n\r\nthere  waiting  to  give a clap whenever  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister keeps on talking about open confrontation. I do not know what he means by open confrontation. Today Indonesia is also having open confrontation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Now, as you know,\r\n\r\nwe  have asked for permits to hold rallies on  three\r\n\r\nSundays and each time the permits have been refused.\r\n\r\nWhy   are   they   afraid?   If   they   want   open\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  why  do  they  have  to   guillotine\r\n\r\ndebates   for  example?  Why  do  they  not   really\r\n\r\nconfront?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the referendum, it is clear proof that\r\n\r\nthey  dare not have open confrontation with  us.  If\r\n\r\nthey  really want to depend on the open argument  to\r\n\r\nconvince  people, they do not have to  arrest  their\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents. All this clearly  proves  that\r\n\r\nalthough the P.A.P. talk of open confrontation, they\r\n\r\nthemselves are very much afraid of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk of being buried by history.

Member:</b> Then start counting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole strategy of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in all that they have been doing for the last\r\n\r\ncouple  of  years  consists  in  just  fighting  for\r\n\r\nsurvival.  Whenever  any straw  appears, they  just\r\n\r\ngrasp  at  the straw and hope that this  straw  will\r\n\r\nkeep  them afloat. And therefore they use all  their\r\n\r\ningenuity  and devote all their energy  towards  the\r\n\r\ngrasping  at straws. The Prime Minister has admitted\r\n\r\nthat the referendum counting was done in such a  way\r\n\r\nas  to  allow  the P.A.P. to know their strength  in\r\n\r\nparticular  division. We mentioned this  many,  many\r\n\r\ntimes  before.  Now, we hear them  openly  admitting\r\n\r\nthat what we said is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly on the Federal elections. We also pointed\r\n\r\nout that the whole idea behind the Federal elections\r\n\r\nwas  to allow the P.A.P. to find safe seats. We have\r\n\r\nan  open admission now from the Prime Minister about\r\n\r\nthis  fact.  They call it the controlled experiment.\r\n\r\nOf  course, it would be very well controlled by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  I think that is why perhaps  the  other\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition are also opposed to  this\r\n\r\ntype of legal rigging of elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I am very glad that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nadmitted very, very many things that we had said  in\r\n\r\n1961. We had said, for example, that he had to go up\r\n\r\nand  persuade the Tunku, and he went up to tell  the\r\n\r\nTunku stories. He has also confirmed that it is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that offered civil aviation, telecoms and all\r\n\r\nthings,  confirming in every detail of what we  said\r\n\r\nabout the sell-out of the P.A.P. - a sell-out of  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAt  that time we pointed out that the P.A.P. wanted\r\n\r\nthis  merger as a diversion, in order to divert  the\r\n\r\nattention   of   the   people  from   the   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nincompetence  and  moral bankruptcy.  Now  realising\r\n\r\nthat the British electronic computer is at work, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should forget all talk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their  own brilliance, of their own  cleverness,\r\n\r\nand consult the people of Singapore in whatever they\r\n\r\ndo.  Sir,  the  present Malaysia  Agreement  is  the\r\n\r\ndirect result of P.A.P. haughtiness and arrogance in\r\n\r\nthe  way  they go about things. They fail to realise\r\n\r\nthat although the British did not openly suggest the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan,  the British had  in  fact  arranged\r\n\r\nthings in such a way that it is the P.A.P. that  had\r\n\r\nto  go along peddling selling the plan all over  the\r\n\r\nworld, helping to promote British interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a little while back that Article V1 is\r\n\r\nthe  essence  of the whole Malaysia Agreement.  This\r\n\r\nArticle VI also explains how the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  asked to pay a lot of money towards  armed\r\n\r\nexpansion and towards defence, not of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe five regions but of British vested interests  in\r\n\r\nthe  region. They do not shout anti-colonial slogans\r\n\r\nnowadays.  In fact, the Prime Minister  equates  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  Singapore, so far as the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are concerned, to the importance  of  the\r\n\r\nbase. The base is important only to the British. But\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime Minister, that is the most  important\r\n\r\naspect of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the other day the Deputy Prime Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  the main function of the Singapore Airport  is\r\n\r\nto  serve the British as a jumping-board to suppress\r\n\r\nthe national liberation movement in Brunei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the few hours of talking by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhe,  in  fact said very little. All his talking  was\r\n\r\ndirected  at  propaganda to  help  defend  his  weak\r\n\r\nposition.  In  fact,  I  remember  when  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  came  back  from London  he  sounded  very\r\n\r\napologetic  in  his T.V. speech. He just  could  not\r\n\r\nstand up to the occasion which was prepared for  him\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. propaganda machinery in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  wanted to bill him as a hero, but he knew that\r\n\r\nhe  was not a hero, and therefore in everything that\r\n\r\nhe  said on that day he sounded very poor. He  could\r\n\r\nnot put his points across.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few preliminary remarks which I want\r\n\r\nto  make before I go into my main speech. But before\r\n\r\nI really go on, Sir, I wish to protest at the way in\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. Government has treated this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole   debate.  The  Prime  Minister  offered   his\r\n\r\napologies to the House yesterday, but I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  was any consolation for us who have to  debate\r\n\r\nthis  very  important motion. As the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself has admitted, the motion before the House is\r\n\r\na  very important one. It refers to documents  which\r\n\r\nrun  into  hundreds of pages. If we  are  to  debate\r\n\r\nthese  documents fully, it is only right and  proper\r\n\r\nthat we in the Opposition be given adequate time  to\r\n\r\nstudy  them.  Then we would be the  better  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute our hit towards the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject material for debate today conies from\r\n\r\nthree official papers issued by the Government.  Two\r\n\r\nof these documents were made available to us only on\r\n\r\nthe  late  evening  of Friday, 26th  July,  1963.  I\r\n\r\nreceived  Misc. Papers 4 and 5 of 1963 at home  well\r\n\r\npast 9.30 p.m. that night. Since then I have managed\r\n\r\nto  run through these two papers. But the third one,\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia Agreement, which runs into 232  pages,\r\n\r\nwas  only  sent  to  Opposition  Members  on  Sunday\r\n\r\nafternoon,  27th July, 1963. I received my  copy  at\r\n\r\nhome   at   12.35  p.m. on  Sunday.   Under   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, Sir, there is not enough time for  us\r\n\r\nto run through these bulky documents. In fact, there\r\n\r\nis  no time to do anything else other than to merely\r\n\r\nread  through  them.  This  late  delivery  of   the\r\n\r\nimportant  documents to us is, of course,  meant  to\r\n\r\ndelay us or deny us the time and the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nstudy them carefully and minutely. I wish to protest\r\n\r\nand  say that this is a highly irresponsible way  of\r\n\r\ndoing things. The adjournment of the debate to today\r\n\r\ndoes  allow us in the Opposition more time to  study\r\n\r\nthese  important  documents, but this  is  done  not\r\n\r\nbecause the P.A.P. has any consideration for  us  in\r\n\r\nthe Opposition. It is my guess, Sir, that because of\r\n\r\nthe  late  hours the Prime Minister  keeps  and  the\r\n\r\nfrantic   electioneering   campaign   he   is    now\r\n\r\nconducting, in his tours, he himself has  not  found\r\n\r\ntime to prepare his own speech in this House. So the\r\n\r\npostponement yesterday was not to allow us  time  to\r\n\r\nread  the  documents but to allow  himself  time  to\r\n\r\nprepare what he wanted to say. He could very  easily\r\n\r\nhave got the documents ready for us many days before\r\n\r\nSunday. The London Agreement was signed on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9th of July. It is how the 30th. The documents could\r\n\r\nhave  been made available to us long, long ago. But,\r\n\r\nof  course, that did not suit the Government. So the\r\n\r\ndocuments were handed to us late and it was in  fact\r\n\r\nmeant  to deny us, the Opposition, a chance to study\r\n\r\nthem carefully. Our position is very clear. Whatever\r\n\r\nit  is  we  fight back. We shall always do our  best\r\n\r\nunder all circumstances - whether it be one day, two\r\n\r\ndays  or three days in which to debate. And we shall\r\n\r\ndo everything possible to expose the P.A.P. and show\r\n\r\nthe  dangers  to  the  people of  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\npresent sell-out Malaysia Agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I say anything further. I might also\r\n\r\nsay  a  few words about the Press in. Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nknow  the  local Press is under heavy pressure  from\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government. But the Press has  also  its\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to the general public.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant debate before the House. We understand the\r\n\r\npapers  have  to give a lot of space to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndocuments and to what the Ministers have to say, but\r\n\r\nthe  views  of the Opposition are just as  important\r\n\r\nand  should therefore be given adequate coverage  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers.  This does not  mean  that  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  publicity for ourselves, but in view of  the\r\n\r\nimportance of this debate, the newspapers,  if  they\r\n\r\nstill  want  to  claim  that  they  are  independent\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  must shoulder their responsibility  and\r\n\r\nplace all the facts and all aspects of the issue  at\r\n\r\nstake  before  the people. It is only when  all  the\r\n\r\nfacts  and  aspects of the issue  have  been  placed\r\n\r\nbefore  the people that they will be able to  decide\r\n\r\nfor  themselves  on the matter. The  people  have  a\r\n\r\nright  to have all the facts placed before  them.  I\r\n\r\nask  the  newspapers not to forget  their  duty  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  the  general  public.  This   is\r\n\r\nespecially  so today when the P.A.P. is  doing  its\r\n\r\nbest to shut out Opposition news and to deny to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  the  basic rights of assembly  and  free\r\n\r\nspeech as well as the right and opportunity to  have\r\n\r\ndirect contact with the masses in mass rallies.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. fears   exposure.   It   talks   of    open\r\n\r\nconfrontation  but  is  scared  stiff  to  have  it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the time is not too distant when the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  no more.

There is  fear\r\n\r\nof  P.A.P. repression and ruthlessness all over  the\r\n\r\nisland.  There  is  fear of the  secret  police  and\r\n\r\nP.A.P. informers. Singapore, in fact, is  a  police\r\n\r\nState.  But very soon all of us will be relieved  of\r\n\r\nthis  P.A.P. arrogance, haughtiness and over-hearing\r\n\r\nattitude. The P.A.P. recently mobilised the whole of\r\n\r\nthe  Government machinery and the State of Singapore\r\n\r\ninto giving the Prime Minister a hero's reception on\r\n\r\nhis return from London. P.A.P. branches were ordered\r\n\r\nto scrap all available men for an airport reception.\r\n\r\nBut  as usual the hulk of the reception and audience\r\n\r\nfor the Prime Minister came\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  from the masses but from the Work Brigade  boys\r\n\r\nand from the community centres. School children were\r\n\r\nordered to line the route as in all the constituency\r\n\r\ntours of the Prime Minister. And because there was a\r\n\r\ndelay in the plane's arrival on that day, the school\r\n\r\nchildren  had  to stand waiting by the roadside  for\r\n\r\nthree hours. All in order to give the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to deceive the outside  world  with\r\n\r\nhis so-called popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a letter the other day, Sir, from a\r\n\r\nschool child in a school in Siglap and he complained\r\n\r\nthat  he was asked, in fact directed, to stand at  a\r\n\r\ncertain  place and to wave his flag when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister come along on Sunday and he asked that such\r\n\r\nfact  be made known to the public in Singapore. This\r\n\r\nis  only one example. Sir,I do not intend to  waste\r\n\r\nthe time of the House quoting letters and complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  people  all the time, all over the  place.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Sir, this billing of the Prime Minister  as\r\n\r\nthe  star of this P.A.P. Gilbert and Sullivan  opera\r\n\r\nwas  meant to cover up the public resentment against\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. sell-out in London, and as part of a huge\r\n\r\nP.A.P. conspiracy to turn things  upside  down  and\r\n\r\nblack into white, a traitor of Singapore was crowned\r\n\r\nthe  champion  of  the interest  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Indeed, Sir, it would  be  difficult  to\r\n\r\nfind  a  more  ridiculous and  absurd  situation  in\r\n\r\nP.A.P. topsy-turvy land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has talked a lot about\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  He  has  said  that  he  is  proud  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship. I agree with that statement.\r\n\r\nBut very unfortunately he has turned the good first-class Singapore citizenship into an inferior second-class  citizenship. Since 1961, Sir, we have pointed\r\n\r\nout, both inside and outside this Assembly, the sell-out arrangements in the White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961.\r\n\r\nThe  White Paper does not give us genuine Federation\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  Neither does it  give  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  that  is, Singapore and the  Federation,  a\r\n\r\ncommon  political  life.  Singapore  citizens   will\r\n\r\nbecome second-class citizen. In an effort to deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people,  the  name  \"Federation  national\"  was\r\n\r\nchanged into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Malaysia citizenship (Singapore)\". But as  we  have\r\n\r\npointed  out, this is only a change in nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThere is no change in content. The Singapore citizen\r\n\r\nis  politically confined to Singapore. The Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizenship (Singapore) is good only for the  island\r\n\r\nof   Singapore.  Whereas  Malaysian  citizens   from\r\n\r\nSarawak  and  Sabah  will  be  able  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to  vote  and stand  for  election,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizen (Singapore) will still not be able\r\n\r\nto  go  to  the  Federation to  vote  or  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection.  This  at once, Sir, shows the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween   the  citizenship  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of  the Borneo territories.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  says  that  the only  value  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship  lies in its right to have  housing  and\r\n\r\neducational  facilities  which  are  not  given   to\r\n\r\ncitizens in other parts of Malaysia. This is a  very\r\n\r\nirresponsible  way of talking about citizenship.  It\r\n\r\nonly   shows   how  far  the  Prime   Minister   has\r\n\r\ndegenerated  in  his  political  bankruptcy.   There\r\n\r\nagain,   Singapore  does  not  have  anything   like\r\n\r\nproportional  representation. With a  population  of\r\n\r\n1.7  million,  Singapore will  get  only  15  seats,\r\n\r\nwhereas  Sarawak with a population one-half that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  get  24 seats,  and  Sabah  with  a\r\n\r\npopulation  only one-quarter that of Singapore  will\r\n\r\nget  16  seats.  We have pointed out that  with  the\r\n\r\ninadequate    representations   in    the    Central\r\n\r\nParliament, Singapore will not be able to  safeguard\r\n\r\nits  vital interests, especially when the Federation\r\n\r\nwill  have overall financial control over Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  there  was no talk at that time  in  1961,  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently too, even of a common market. The whole\r\n\r\nof  the White Paper, therefore, is completely to the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage of Singapore. All one sided as admitted\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister himself only three months ago.\r\n\r\nAll  this  talk of autonomy in labour and  education\r\n\r\nbecomes  nonsense when control of internal  security\r\n\r\nwill  allow  the  Federation  to  interfere  in  the\r\n\r\nrunning of these two departments in Singapore as and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Federation politicians feel so  inclined.\r\n\r\nThe  White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 was passed  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly after a walk-out of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  United  People's Party and the  Workers'  Party\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.  This White Paper was subsequently  put\r\n\r\nto  the  people  in  a  undemocratic  and  dishonest\r\n\r\nreferendum.   Through  the  use   of   threats   and\r\n\r\nintimidation  the  P.A.P. coerced  the  people  into\r\n\r\nvoting  for this White Paper. The P.A.P. has  always\r\n\r\nclaimed  that since the White Paper had been  passed\r\n\r\nin  the Legislative Assembly and later voted for  in\r\n\r\nthe  sham referendum, so it represents the  will  of\r\n\r\nthe   people.  We,  on  the  contrary,  have  always\r\n\r\nmaintained that the P.A.P. referendum never did  and\r\n\r\nnever  could  reflect the will  and  desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeople freely expressed. But since the P.A.P. always\r\n\r\nprefer  to stick to the so-called legality  of  that\r\n\r\nmatter  and say that the White Paper has the support\r\n\r\nof  the  people  because it has been passed  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and has been \"approved\" by  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the sham referendum, let us now  examine\r\n\r\nthe  London Agreement on this basis and see how  far\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian terms, or P.A.P. merger terms, signed\r\n\r\nin  London are at variance with the White Paper that\r\n\r\nhas  been  passed  in the Legislative  Assembly  and\r\n\r\n\"approved\" by the people in the sham referendum. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has repeatedly emphasised in its bold,  tough\r\n\r\nposturing that, in the financial talks at one stage,\r\n\r\neverything has already been agreed to in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper and in the exchange of letters between him and\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister of the Federation. \"If there was\r\n\r\nanything  to be altered in the terms of  merger,  it\r\n\r\nwould   have  to  be  renegotiated,  redebated   and\r\n\r\nreendorsed.\"  That  was  what  the  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nhimself said not so very long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first see what the Malaysian citizenship\r\n\r\n(Singapore) means in this Malaysia Agreement  signed\r\n\r\nin  London  on 9th July, 1963. May I refer  to  Cmd.\r\n\r\nPaper 22 of 1963, clause 23, sub-clause (3), at page\r\n\r\n20, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Citizenship of Singapore shall not be severable\r\n\r\nfrom  citizenship of the Federation, but a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  by the loss of either shall lose the  other\r\n\r\nalso (subject to the provision made by this Part for\r\n\r\nthe  enrolment of a Singapore citizen as  a  citizen\r\n\r\nwho is not a Singapore citizen).'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What does this mean, Sir? This means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  fact,  that deprivation of Malaysia  citizenship\r\n\r\n(Singapore),   that   is,   Singapore   citizenship,\r\n\r\nautomatically   means   deprivation   of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.    Clause   64   of    the    Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution,  on  page 153, the clause  talking  of\r\n\r\n\"Termination of citizenship of Malaysia\" reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where a person who is a citizen of Singapore has\r\n\r\nrenounced  his  citizenship  of  Malaysia  or   been\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  his  citizenship of  Malaysia  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Federation such person  shall  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have renounced or been deprived  of  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship of Singapore under this Constitution and\r\n\r\nsuch   person  shall  cease  to  be  a  citizen   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  citizen of Singapore, with such  valuable\r\n\r\nrights  according  to the Prime. Minister  a  little\r\n\r\nwhile   back,  after  becoming  a  Malaysia  citizen\r\n\r\n(Singapore)   now  automatically   loses   his   own\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship once he loses his second-class\r\n\r\nMalaysia citizenship (Singapore). It is a ridiculous\r\n\r\nsituation. In other words, our citizenship that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  won as a result of many years of anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle  and  sacrifice can now be lost  through  a\r\n\r\nstroke  of  the pen of some politicians  miles  away\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore. Our citizenship now becomes entirely\r\n\r\ndependent on the whims and fancies of politicians in\r\n\r\nthe Federation. The Singapore citizen is controlled,\r\n\r\nkicked  about  like  a football  by  people  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Malaysia citizen (Singapore)  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Federal national on which we debated  at\r\n\r\nlength in the merger debate in 1961. We have pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  the  Federal national has duties  but  no\r\n\r\nrights.  For example, he has duties to be taxed  and\r\n\r\nto  be called up as a soldier. His only right  as  a\r\n\r\nFederal national or Malaysia citizenship (Singapore)\r\n\r\nis the right to hold a Federal passport, and nothing\r\n\r\nelse.  This second-class citizenship is not a  gain.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary, it brings with it  the  extremely\r\n\r\ngrave   danger   of  loss  of  our   own   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.    Without    the    present     merger\r\n\r\narrangements,  the Singapore citizen needs  fear  no\r\n\r\none  outside  Singapore. Now if he should  displease\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  politicians who are  in  power,  he\r\n\r\nmight  well lose his own citizenship. Is it  not  an\r\n\r\nironical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  absurd situation - to become a Malaysian citizen\r\n\r\n(Singapore),  a pore citizen gains nothing?  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  he  stands to lose. This is  now  clearly\r\n\r\nstated in the proposed Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to clause 27 (7) on page 23.\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A certificate of naturalisation as a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  shall not be granted without the occurrence\r\n\r\nof the government of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  sounds  as  if  the Singapore  Government  has\r\n\r\ncertain  powers.  But it, in fact,  means  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government has already lost its  power  to\r\n\r\ngrant   naturalisation  certificates  to  its   twin\r\n\r\ncitizens.  The  power  now has  been  given  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the Singapore Government  can  only\r\n\r\nconcur   with   the  decision  of   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  Even the registration of  citizens  must\r\n\r\nhave  the  concurrence of the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nThis  can  be  seen  in clause57  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution  at  page 150. At the  bottom  of  that\r\n\r\npage,  it reads that such registration can  only  be\r\n\r\nregistered with the concurrence of the Government of\r\n\r\nthe Federation as a citizen of Singapore. This is  a\r\n\r\nloss  of power of the Singapore Government. In fact,\r\n\r\nit  means  a  loss o, the basic rights of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  to pressure their own Government for  more\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and  freedom. The citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nuntil  today  are still ruled by the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment, thousands of miles away, a Government in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  people of Singapore are not represented.\r\n\r\nNow  Singapore  citizens are similarly  ruled  by  a\r\n\r\nGovernment far away in Kuala Lumpur, a Government in\r\n\r\nwhich  the people of Singapore do not have  adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation and influence. And the people who try\r\n\r\nto  increase  this representation and influence  run\r\n\r\nthe  grave  risk  of  losing  their  citizenship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, the Government in Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nis  no  different  from the imperial  Government  in\r\n\r\nLondon,  so  far  as  the people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly pointed out. Sir, that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger proposals will only make Singapore  a\r\n\r\ncolony  of  the Federation. This is clear  proof  of\r\n\r\nwhat we have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to page 23, clause 28 (1) and\r\n\r\n(2) ?  Here  it  lays down that in  the  granting  of\r\n\r\nFederation citizenship to Singapore citizens and non-Singapore  citizens, the Federation Government  does\r\n\r\nnot confer any advantage on the Singapore citizen as\r\n\r\nagainst the foreigner. In other words, the status of\r\n\r\na  Singapore  citizen is no better than  that  of  a\r\n\r\nforeigner.  For  example, Sir, if you,  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen,  and  another non-citizen  both  apply  for\r\n\r\nFederation  citizenship and  both  applications  are\r\n\r\ntreated in the same way, then it in fact means  that\r\n\r\nbeing   a   citizen  has  given  you  no   advantage\r\n\r\nwhatsoever,   both   are  treated   exactly   alike.\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens,  therefore,  are  treated  like\r\n\r\nforeigners and are no better than foreigners in  the\r\n\r\npresent merger arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again refer you, Sir, to clause 56 in page\r\n\r\n150?   There  it  lays  down  a  large   number   of\r\n\r\nconditions, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), which a  person\r\n\r\nhas  to  fulfil before he can become  a  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We want to point out that this  is  mere\r\n\r\neyewash   and  nothing  else.  It  gives   a   false\r\n\r\nimpression  to  the  people  that  with  all   these\r\n\r\nconditions  it  is  just as difficult  to  become  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  as it is  to  become  a  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen. But, and the rub is here, who would  bother\r\n\r\nto  change a citizenship that is of h4gher value for\r\n\r\na  citizenship that is of lower value? Nobody  would\r\n\r\ncare to change his own first-class citizenship for a\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizenship. Therefore, although  these\r\n\r\nconditions  are  written down in  the  Constitution,\r\n\r\nthey are there merely to give a false impression  to\r\n\r\nthe people concerning the value of this second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back again to page 22, clause 26,\r\n\r\nparagraph (d).  Here  it  lays  down  the   language\r\n\r\nqualification  in  citizenship by  registration, it\r\n\r\nsays  Malay,  English, \"or any  native  language  in\r\n\r\ncurrent  use in Sarawak\". For example. Iban  can  be\r\n\r\nused  as one o, the languages if they want to accept\r\n\r\nit  as  a  language to test a person  who  wants  to\r\n\r\nqualify for citizenship. Sir, my complaint is  this:\r\n\r\nthere  are many languages in common use in Singapore\r\n\r\nand in the Federation itself, e.g. Tamil, Chinese,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand other languages. But they are not recognised  as\r\n\r\nsuitable for use in such language tests. This  shows\r\n\r\nmost  clearly  the unfair and unjust  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  Chinese and Tamil. Moreover,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuch  thing  as the waiving of the language  barrier\r\n\r\nfor  the first year as in the original Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis   shows  the  discrimination  that   has   been\r\n\r\npractised against the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the Singapore Citizenship Ordinance\r\n\r\nadmits  the principle of jus Soli, i.e. every person\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore becomes a citizen of Singapore  by\r\n\r\nbirth.  Sir,  this is our basic inherent  right  and\r\n\r\nthis principle is recognised in almost all civilised\r\n\r\ncountries  of the world. Yet clause 54 (2)   (c), at\r\n\r\npage 150, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A person shall not be a citizen of Singapore by\r\n\r\nvirtue of clause (1)  of this Article if at the  time\r\n\r\nof his birth -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) neither of his parents was a citizen of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and neither of them was a permanent\r\n\r\nresident in the Federation:'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words, Sir, a person born of parents  who\r\n\r\nare  not permanent residents in Singapore will  lose\r\n\r\nhis  right of citizenship by birth.

I hope the P.A.P. will rectify\r\n\r\nthis before they get out from government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer you. Sir, to section 8 (3) of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Citizenship Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  lays  down that a woman may be registered  as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Singapore if she is  properly  married,\r\n\r\naccording  to  law, to a Singapore citizen.  But  in\r\n\r\nCmd. Paper 22 of 1963, page 151, clause 57 (2), lays\r\n\r\ndown   two   further  conditions   for   citizenship\r\n\r\nregistration in Singapore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) that she has resided continuously in the State\r\n\r\nfor  a period of not less than two years immediately\r\n\r\npreceding the date of the application: and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that she is of good character.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are most unreasonable conditions,\r\n\r\nespecially  the condition of this \"good  character\".\r\n\r\nWhat  is  a  good  character  and  what  is  a   bad\r\n\r\ncharacter?  Front the way the Federation politicians\r\n\r\nlook  at  things, any person who opposes the  ruling\r\n\r\nParty in the Federation can be deemed to be a person\r\n\r\nof  bad  character.  Well, the Prime  Minister,  who\r\n\r\nsells  Singapore  down the river to the  Federation,\r\n\r\nmight  consider himself a person of good  character.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the increasing acrimony in the open  feud\r\n\r\nbetween the P.A.P. and the M.C.A., it might well  be\r\n\r\nthat,  if  Khaw Kai Boh, for example, should  become\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Minister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> God help you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Prime Minister himself will\r\n\r\nnot  be  considered a person of good character.  And\r\n\r\nthen  what happens? The Prime Minister himself  will\r\n\r\nlose  his citizenship because he is no more a person\r\n\r\nof  good  character. [Laughter] It may well be.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  this  kind of conditions  be  put  down?  We\r\n\r\nconsider all this very unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then. Sir, in page 153, clause 65, which deals with\r\n\r\ndeprivation  of citizenship and the cancellation  of\r\n\r\nthe enrolment of any child of that person. This,  to\r\n\r\nour  thinking,  is  another unjust and  unreasonable\r\n\r\nprovision.   It  has  been  a  universal  principle,\r\n\r\naccepted  in all civilized countries, that the  sins\r\n\r\nof  the  father should not be visited on his  child.\r\n\r\nBut  this  provision  wants us to  uphold  something\r\n\r\ndiametrically opposed to this universal principle. I\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  this  provision  was  added  as  an\r\n\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution early in 1962.\r\n\r\nNow  we are asked to have the same amendment in  our\r\n\r\nSingapore constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  a shame and it is  a  most  unfair,\r\n\r\nunreasonable, unjust, illogical provision  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted by the P.A.P. Government. We say  all\r\n\r\nthese  provisions are unjust. The PAP, now talks  of\r\n\r\nlogic  and  cold  reason. Fair and just?  Are  these\r\n\r\nprovisions fair and just to the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise all these new blessings of\r\n\r\nMalaysia for the Singapore citizen:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Singapore citizen can now lose his\r\n\r\ncitizenship  if  he is deprived of his  new  second-class Malaysian Citizenship (Singapore).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Singapore loses its power to grant\r\n\r\nnaturalisation certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singapore loses its power to grant registration\r\n\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A person born in Singapore loses his basic right\r\n\r\nof citizenship by birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The child of a Singapore citizen can lose his or\r\n\r\nher  citizenship  if  the  parent's  citizenship  is\r\n\r\ncancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Definition of \"good character\" of a person in\r\n\r\nSingapore  now depends on the whims and  fancies  of\r\n\r\npoliticians  in  the Federation,  that  is,  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The wife of a Singapore citizen needs further\r\n\r\nresidential  qualification to become  a  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we see from all these amendments? We see\r\n\r\nin  them proof of what we have repeatedly said  time\r\n\r\nand  time  again. We have seen in them  clear  proof\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore citizen has been converted from a\r\n\r\nfirst-class citizen into a second-class citizen with\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. merger.  Singapore  citizens   become\r\n\r\nMalaysian Citizens (Singapore). Sarawak citizens and\r\n\r\nSabah citizens also become Malaysian citizens,  just\r\n\r\nlike  all  the  Federation of Malaya  citizens.  But\r\n\r\nSabah  and Sarawak citizens have no chop on them  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens have. Whereas Sarawak and  Sabah\r\n\r\ncitizens  have  the  same rights and  privileges  as\r\n\r\nFederation  Malaysian citizens,  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nisolated and not given these equal rights. Sabah and\r\n\r\nSarawak  citizens can go to the Federation  to  vote\r\n\r\nand  to  stand for election. The Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nare  denied  these rights. Why should  this  be  so?\r\n\r\nWhere  is  equality? Where is the Malaysian  citizen\r\n\r\nbeing  saved for Singapore? it is clear  proof  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore citizens, are second-class  citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  law  makes  it difficult still  for  people  to\r\n\r\nobtain  Singapore citizenship. But the P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nhas  now  made  it very easy to lose  it.  You  gain\r\n\r\nnothing,  but you lose a lot. I must point out  that\r\n\r\nthese   new  citizenship  laws  for  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore were not debated on in the merger  debate.\r\n\r\nThey  are  all new additions and the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  no right, no mandate, from this House to change\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper and the later exchange of letters\r\n\r\nstate  that Singapore citizens will become Malaysian\r\n\r\nCitizens  (Singapore). But the  White  Paper  states\r\n\r\n- may  I  refer  you, Sir, to the White  Paper'?  The\r\n\r\nWhite Paper states on page 4, section 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All Singapore citizens will keep their\r\n\r\ncitizenship...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  in  the  last line of the first  paragraph,  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore citizens will continue to enjoy their\r\n\r\nState rights and privileges within Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the White Paper debated and \"endorsed\"\r\n\r\nby the people in the sham P.A.P. referendum. Now, we\r\n\r\nsee  that the Singapore citizen will not be able  to\r\n\r\nkeep  his  citizenship. Neither will be continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy   his  State  rights  and  privileges   within\r\n\r\nSingapore,  if at any time he displeases the  bosses\r\n\r\nin the Federation. The Singapore citizen, therefore,\r\n\r\nis  now  sold hook, line and sinker. What right  has\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  change  all these  provisions?  The\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore have thought all along that they\r\n\r\nwould continue to enjoy their citizenship rights and\r\n\r\nprivileges.  The P.A.P. repeatedly said this  during\r\n\r\nthe  1961 merger debate, during the Chinese  Chamber\r\n\r\nof  Commerce forum, and later during the  referendum\r\n\r\ncampaign. Why has the P.A.P. not told the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  all  this  before?  Why  did  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister say one thing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  agree to another? Is it not a sell-out  through\r\n\r\nand  through'! Has he not become the traitor? Is  he\r\n\r\nnot  the traitor? Of course, he is. Selling out  all\r\n\r\nour  rights.  Let the P.A.P. inform  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  why  the Prime Minister signed  away  all\r\n\r\nthose rights of Singapore in this manner. Now it  is\r\n\r\ntruly  a  sell-out, signed in London. All  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  in  great  danger  of  losing   their\r\n\r\ncitizenship   rights  if  at  any  time   Federation\r\n\r\npoliticians  feel like exercising their rights.  For\r\n\r\nthis,  we  must  thank  the  P.A.P. and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, the traitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, Sir, to refer to another subject. I wish to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the question of the powers of the  State.\r\n\r\nMay  I  refer you to page 29, clause 39, sub-clause\r\n\r\n(1), which deals with emergency Jaws? It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Article 150 of the Constitution (which makes\r\n\r\nspecial  provision for legislation in the  event  of\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong being satisfied  of  the\r\n\r\nexistence of a grave emergency whereby the  security\r\n\r\nor  economic life of the Federation or of  any  part\r\n\r\nthereof is threatened, whether ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And now these are the important words, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... by war or external aggression or internal\r\n\r\ndisturbance)  there shall be omitted in  clause  (1) \r\n\r\nthe words \"whether by war or external aggression  or\r\n\r\nby internal disturbance\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What does this clause mean? It means that when there\r\n\r\nis   no  war  or  external  aggression  or  internal\r\n\r\ndisturbance,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  or   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government or the U.M.N.O. Alliance  can,\r\n\r\nat  any time, according to the whims and fancies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation politicians, proclaim  an  emergency\r\n\r\nand impose a dictatorship over the whole Federation.\r\n\r\nIt  means that at any time the politicians  who  are\r\n\r\nnow  in  power, when they feel so inclined, can  use\r\n\r\nthe   State   powers  to  suppress   all   political\r\n\r\nopponents. It means that even in time of peace  when\r\n\r\nthere is no external aggression and when there is no\r\n\r\ninternal disturbance, the Federation Government  can\r\n\r\nsubject the lives of the people to wartime emergency\r\n\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are very important powers. They should\r\n\r\nnot be lightly given, because these powers mean,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  that, the very limited freedoms that  we  haw\r\n\r\nwon    through   such   hardships,   sacrifice   and\r\n\r\nunremitting struggles all through the years - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What sacrifice have you made?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - can, with one stroke of the\r\n\r\npen,  he  taken away and military and  Fascist  rule\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the people. Do we want to have  such  a\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs? The power to use these Emergency-Law  provisions lies with the ruling Party, and  the\r\n\r\npeople are in no position to prevent misuse or abuse\r\n\r\nof  such powers. At any time, emergency restrictions\r\n\r\ncan  take away the basic freedoms of the people,  of\r\n\r\nassociation   and   assembly,   free   speech    and\r\n\r\npublication. May I ask what safeguards then have  we\r\n\r\nof  the  limited democracy that we have  today  - the\r\n\r\nlimited democracy that has been won after all  these\r\n\r\nyears  of  hard  struggle?  This  is  an  outrageous\r\n\r\nprovision.  We  can  understand the  British  and  a\r\n\r\nreactionary  ruling Party wanting such a  provision,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  enables a colonial  and  a  reactionary\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  ride roughshod over all  opposition,\r\n\r\nbut  for the P.A.P., that has claimed to be  at  one\r\n\r\ntime a socialist Party, to agree to such a provision\r\n\r\nis incredible. Why? How can the Prime Minister still\r\n\r\nclaim  that  he has the interests of the  people  at\r\n\r\nheart?   By  actively  promoting  such  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nAgreement,  he  now  shows  to  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that he is truly a hundred per cent  out-and-out  colonial stooge. How does he hope to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  equal and just society by agreeing  to\r\n\r\nsuch   a  provision?  Overnight,  all  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstalwarts and socialists can be put into prison  and\r\n\r\na military dictatorship imposed. Sir, this provision\r\n\r\nmust be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you to page 27, clause 35, sub-clause\r\n\r\n(1)  of the Malayan constitution Documents? It refers\r\n\r\nto  \"appropriate supplement to List II\".  Before  we\r\n\r\ntalk  of  this,  let  me refer you  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution. Article 76, subsection (4)  on page  60\r\n\r\nallows the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation Parliament to legislate for the State  in\r\n\r\ncertain, cases. Article 91, subsection (5), on  page\r\n\r\n70  relates  to  control  of Parliament  over  State\r\n\r\nlands, mining, agriculture and forestry through  the\r\n\r\nNational Land Council. Article 95, subsection (1)  on\r\n\r\npage   73  of  the  Malayan  Constitution  Documents\r\n\r\nrelates to the inspection of State activities by any\r\n\r\nFederation officer. And Article 92 relates to powers\r\n\r\ngiven  for the National Development Plan. All  these\r\n\r\nrelate  to  financial control contained in  Articles\r\n\r\n108, 109 and 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Article 75 deals with the inconsistencies\r\n\r\nbetween the Federation and State laws. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any State law is inconsistent with the Federal\r\n\r\nlaw, the Federal law shall prevail and the State law\r\n\r\nshall to the extent of the inconsistency be void.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  let me refer you back again to clause 35, sub-clause  (1)   of  Cmd.  22 of  1963.  There  it  says\r\n\r\n\"appropriate supplements\". What are the  appropriate\r\n\r\nsupplements? Do they refer to labour and  education?\r\n\r\nIn  actual  fact,  in  Part II  of  the  List  II.B.\r\n\r\nEducation, Labour, Medicine and Health are listed as\r\n\r\nState lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, remembering all this, let me now refer you to\r\n\r\nclause  42,  sub-clause (1)   on  page  30.  This  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  because once you know all  the  previous\r\n\r\npowers of the National Development Council, then you\r\n\r\ncan understand how this new clause works. Clause  42\r\n\r\nsub-clause (1)  allows Singapore and the three Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  powers to exercise their State  rights,  but\r\n\r\nsub-clause (2)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Article shall cease to have effect in the\r\n\r\ncase of Singapore if Parliament with the concurrence\r\n\r\nof the Governor so provides.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, what power has been given  in  sub-clause (1)  now gets taken away in sub-clause (2)   so\r\n\r\nfar as Singapore is concerned. And therefore Article\r\n\r\n76  in  the  Constitution  will  apply  in  toto  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. Article 76 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliament may make laws with respect to any\r\n\r\nmatter enumerated in the State List.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Through this Article, the Federation Government  can\r\n\r\nnullify whatever autonomies there are in labour  and\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore. If the Federation Government\r\n\r\ncan  use these Articles to act, then, of course, the\r\n\r\nautonomies will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe only autonomies in name, and this is exactly what\r\n\r\nwe  have said long, long ago. It merely proves  that\r\n\r\nthe autonomy is a false one, because at any time  if\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government chooses to  exercise  its\r\n\r\npowers,  the  autonomy can be  interfered  with  and\r\n\r\nrestricted in all sorts of ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 43, sub-clause (1) on page 30 allows the\r\n\r\nFederation Parliament to have control over the State\r\n\r\nin  agriculture and forestry. I see that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  an  amendment  on  this  very  clause\r\n\r\nitself.  But sub-clause (5)  of clause 43 allows  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to  sidestep the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  in  matters of land, etc, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nSabah, it is different. Sub-clause(5)  (a)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Clause (2) shall cease to apply as regards Article\r\n\r\n91,  to Singapore if Parliament so provides with the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Governor.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as the Governor approves,\r\n\r\nany  law  which  the  Government in  the  Federation\r\n\r\ndecides  on,  need not have the concurrence  of  the\r\n\r\nState  Legislative Assembly. It means that  although\r\n\r\nSingapore  is supposed to have autonomy in education\r\n\r\nand  labour,  and although Singapore has  its  State\r\n\r\npowers  over land, forestry, agriculture  and  other\r\n\r\nmatters  of  local government - and such  departments\r\n\r\nare  listed in List 11, that is, the State List,  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ninth  Schedule - there are  now  provisions  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the Central Parliament can nullify  the\r\n\r\nState  powers  of  Singapore  whenever  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament  so  desires. The  State  Governments  of\r\n\r\nother  States  shall not be required to  follow  the\r\n\r\npolicy  formulated by the National Land  Council  or\r\n\r\nany other National Council for local government; and\r\n\r\nthe Central Parliament must have the concurrence  of\r\n\r\nthe  State Legislative Assembly in all projects that\r\n\r\naffect  departments in List II, that is,  the  State\r\n\r\nList. But, and this is a very important `but',  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  Singapore,  it  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent. The Central Parliament can, at any  time,\r\n\r\nsidestep the State Legislative Assembly. The Central\r\n\r\nParliament  need  only have the concurrence  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor of Singapore. What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappens  to  the  powers  of the  State  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly? The Singapore State Government is supposed\r\n\r\nto be in charge of all State departments as put down\r\n\r\nin List II of the Ninth Schedule. And in the case of\r\n\r\nSingapore, they are education, medicine and  health,\r\n\r\nlabour  and social security, factories, electricity,\r\n\r\nitinerant hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Central Parliament, through the National\r\n\r\nLand   Council,  can  easily  interfere   with   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects of education and labour. It may\r\n\r\nwell  even be that the building of a new school will\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed.  Now,  all sorts  of  preposterous\r\n\r\nsituations can arise, and the Federation can  easily\r\n\r\ncontrol  any  expansion of the Education  Department\r\n\r\nand  education services in Singapore. The Federation\r\n\r\nalready   controls  the  Education   Department   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  through internal security. Now  there  is\r\n\r\nfurther indirect control in clause 42 and clause  45\r\n\r\nof  the proposed Federation Constitution. Where then\r\n\r\nis   the  autonomy  in  labour  and  education   for\r\n\r\nSingapore? As far as we can see, it is autonomy only\r\n\r\nin  name,  and it is only autonomy so  long  as  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government does not want to interfere. If\r\n\r\nat  any  time the Federation Government  decides  to\r\n\r\ninterfere,  then  the  autonomy  goes.   These   new\r\n\r\nprovisions make the partnership arrangement  into  a\r\n\r\ncomplete merger arrangement without the compensatory\r\n\r\ngranting  of  citizenship  rights  and  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation to the State of Singapore, and  under\r\n\r\nthose circumstances it becomes most unfair and  most\r\n\r\nunjust to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, again to Cmd. 22 of 1963,\r\n\r\npages  41  and 42? I refer to clause 60  sub-clauses\r\n\r\n(1),  (2)  and (4). All of them refer to restrictions\r\n\r\non  the right to form association conferred by other\r\n\r\nclauses,  and they may even be imposed  by  any  law\r\n\r\nrelating  to  labour and education.  Clause  60  (1) \r\n\r\nalready  talks of restrictions on the right of  free\r\n\r\nmovement throughout the Federation, It can only mean\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be no unification  of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement  in  the area, and it can  only  mean  that\r\n\r\nstudent   travel,   cultural   exchange,   will   be\r\n\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister talks of reciprocal powers, hut that has no meaning when we refer to the Prime Minister's slogan for merger. He used to say, \"National unity through merger.\" With this restriction, how can he talk of national unity when people in one part of the Federation cannot go to another part of the same Federation! The rights\r\n\r\ngained  through all the years of hard struggle  - the\r\n\r\nrights  and  freedoms  of  speech  and  publication,\r\n\r\nassociation   and  assembly  - will  be   immediately\r\n\r\ninterfered with Clause 60 (4)  empowers Parliament to\r\n\r\npass  legislation to restrict association of workers\r\n\r\nand students. We can see from this that there is  no\r\n\r\nautonomy   for   workers  and   unions   and   civic\r\n\r\nOrganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now one more, may I refer to page 47, clause 69\r\n\r\n(1)  (a)  and (c)? Here it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution\r\n\r\nwithout  the  concurrence of  the  Governor  if  the\r\n\r\namendment is such as t affect the operation  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution in relation to Singapore as regards any\r\n\r\nof the following matters -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) citizenship of Singapore, and the restriction\r\n\r\nto citizens of Singapore of the right to be  a\r\n\r\nmember  of either House of Parliament  for  or\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore,  or to be  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of Singapore, or to  vote\r\n\r\nat elections in Singapore;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>According  to  the Prime Minister,  this  clause  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  safeguard  all  the  rights   of   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizens (Singapore) after the coming into\r\n\r\nbeing  of Malaysia. This, to our reading, means  the\r\n\r\npossible  interference of the  rights  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens, but since the Prime Minister has moved  an\r\n\r\namendment  to this clause I will refer to  it  again\r\n\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all that I have enumerated, we can see\r\n\r\nthat  the provisions that have been provided for  us\r\n\r\nin  this proposed Constitution are completely to the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage of Singapore. There is no true autonomy\r\n\r\nin  education  and  labour  Federal  Parliament  can\r\n\r\ncontrol all activities of the State of Singapore. We\r\n\r\narc  particularly against the granting of  emergency\r\n\r\npowers  to the Government when there is no  external\r\n\r\naggression and when there is no civil disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  in  fact  allows  the  Government  to  have  a\r\n\r\nmilitary take-over for a fascist dictatorship.  This\r\n\r\nis entirely contrary to the interests of the people,\r\n\r\nwhether  of Singapore or of the Federation.  And  we\r\n\r\nwill   always   fight   against  such   undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now refer to the recent financial\r\n\r\ntalks and arrangements that have been arrived at  in\r\n\r\nLondon. We already see how the White Paper has  been\r\n\r\nmutilated  on the question of citizenship.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso seen how the P.A.P. has deceived the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   at   every  stage   of   the   financial\r\n\r\nnegotiations. In order that we may more clearly  see\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. sell-out, let us refer to what the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad  originally said. The P.A.P. had told the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   during  the   merger   debate   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently during a forum sponsored by the Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce and then during the Referendum\r\n\r\ncampaign,  the  following aspects in the  sphere  of\r\n\r\nfinance.  On  finance, the P.A.P. said,  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  pay  only for Federal services in  Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance explained, \"Singapore will\r\n\r\nonly  be  paying  to defray the cost of  maintaining\r\n\r\ncertain  departments  of  the  Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nwhich will be administered by the Central Government\r\n\r\nafter merger. These departments are the Police,  the\r\n\r\nPost  Office and Telecommunications, Civil Aviation,\r\n\r\nPrisons,  Audit  Office  and the  Singapore  Defence\r\n\r\nForces.\"  The  Prime Minister said  the  same  thing\r\n\r\nagain  only  a  little while ago. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  gave the explanation at the Chinese Chamber\r\n\r\nof Commerce forum. He said in 1962 that the Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent   Expenditure  of  these  six  departments\r\n\r\nmentioned  amounted  to only  $62  million  and  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates  over  the  four  years   was\r\n\r\nestimated at $35 million, namely, it would  only  be\r\n\r\n$8  million annually. He further said, \"In addition,\r\n\r\nSingapore will only be making a contribution for the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of pan-Malayan (not Malaysian)  Defence\r\n\r\nForce.  The Foreign Office of the Malayan Government\r\n\r\nand  certain  other State institutions such  as  the\r\n\r\nCentral Legislature,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Head of State and so on. This expenditure  will\r\n\r\nbe   shared  by  all  States  including  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories after merger.\" The Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nestimated  that Singapore's contribution  for  these\r\n\r\nservices would be around $8 million a year, which is\r\n\r\nabout   2   per  cent  of  our  annual  expenditure.\r\n\r\nFollowing  this, the Minister for Finance  explained\r\n\r\nand   stressed  that  Singapore's  real   additional\r\n\r\nexpenditure would be around $8 million a  year,  and\r\n\r\nsince the contribution is for specific purposes,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  related to possible deficits in the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment's  budget. Accordingly, the  contribution\r\n\r\nwill not be increased by the Central Government even\r\n\r\nif  it  incurred a deficit,\" and, according  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, \"the actual amount  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  pay  to  the  Federation would  be  only  $62\r\n\r\nmillion  plus $8 million plus $8 million equals  $78\r\n\r\nmillion,  and  Singapore  would  be  paying  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  for  Federal services in  Singapore  one\r\n\r\nlump sum of $78 million.\" That was what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance said in reply to a question in the forum\r\n\r\nsponsored  by  the Chinese Chamber  of  Commerce  in\r\n\r\nearly  1962.  This is what the P.A.P. has  told  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. \"About 20 per  cent  only  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's revenue will be given to the  Federation\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  spent  on  services  provided   for\r\n\r\nSingapore by the Central Government, and the  amount\r\n\r\ngiven in one lump sum comes to only $78 million.\" We\r\n\r\nhave seen what has happened. Has the P.A.P. kept its\r\n\r\npromise made to the people during the merger  debate\r\n\r\nand subsequently, that it would only be $78 million?\r\n\r\nAll   these  are  words  solemnly  said  by   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters, but they are all forgotten. We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  we are now asked to pay a sum which is  double\r\n\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. had been exposed in all its twists and\r\n\r\nturns  on  the  question of citizenship  during  the\r\n\r\nmerger  debate.  Let  us  now  see  how  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsimilarly twists and turns in its last shameful  act\r\n\r\nof  sell-out  of  the interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As  late as 6th April, 1963,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is reported to have said - and it is in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times,  front page headline  - \"Merger  Cash\r\n\r\nDeal. Singapore will keep all her revenue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding tax collections after merger but she  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay the Federation a yearly lump  sum  for\r\n\r\nFederation services.\" This is only three and a  half\r\n\r\nmonths ago - one lump sum for Federation services and\r\n\r\nSingapore  will keep all her revenue  including  tax\r\n\r\ncollections.  Then  on the 13th April,  it  was  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times,  back page, column 4,  paragraph  4.\r\n\r\nDuring   the  so-called  merger  crisis,  (headlines\r\n\r\nagain)  the Prime Minister even put the  sum  to  be\r\n\r\npaid for Federation services in Singapore as low  as\r\n\r\n$50  to $60 million a year. That is what he told the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore and he further stated that  the\r\n\r\nannual  revenue of Singapore is $400 million and  he\r\n\r\nwould  agree  to share with the rest of the  Malayan\r\n\r\nterritories  only  if, only if. Singapore's  revenue\r\n\r\nwas  more than $500 million and above annually. Now,\r\n\r\nthis is what the Prime Minister said. He would agree\r\n\r\nonly  if  Singapore's revenue  was  more  than  $500\r\n\r\nmillion and above annually. But we have seen what he\r\n\r\nhas  given away when the revenue is much, much  less\r\n\r\nthan  $500 million. On that occasion, Sir, he listed\r\n\r\nfour  factors  for the working out  of  a  financial\r\n\r\narrangement  with the Federation, the  four  factors\r\n\r\nbeing  (1)  the number of seats Singapore has in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament: (2)  the area to be defended; (3) \r\n\r\nthe population ratio of the area to be defended; and\r\n\r\n(4)   the  prosperity index including  common  market\r\n\r\narrangements. Now. Paper Misc. 4 of 1963, Section 22\r\n\r\nlists only three factors. This type of talk at  that\r\n\r\ntime   sounded  pretty  tough  and  no  wonder   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  were  misled into describing  such  talk\r\n\r\nwith  words like \"impasse\", \"deadlock\" and  whatnot,\r\n\r\nhut of course such tough talks have turned out to be\r\n\r\na  mere  sham.  The Prime Minister, as  always,  was\r\n\r\nmerely  posturing because facts have  already  shown\r\n\r\nthat  we  are not going to pay just $60 million,  as\r\n\r\nsaid  by  the Prime Minister on the 13th April,  but\r\n\r\ntwo  and half times to three times that amount, that\r\n\r\nis, more than $150 million. What then are those four\r\n\r\nfactors listed by the Prime Minister as reported  in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times on the 13th April, 1963?  We  can\r\n\r\nsee  that (1)  the number of seats Singapore  has  in\r\n\r\nthe Central Parliament has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot increased. It still remains at 15 seats; (2)  the\r\n\r\narea  of  Singapore has not increased  in  size  and\r\n\r\nremains 224 square miles. In fact, I would say  that\r\n\r\nit  has  shrunk in size. I will explain that  later;\r\n\r\n(3)   the  population  has possibly  increased  by  a\r\n\r\nfraction since 3\ufffd months ago, but not much more than\r\n\r\nthat; and (4)  the prosperity index according to what\r\n\r\nwe  can see in the P.A.P. common market arrangements\r\n\r\nis  not going to work to the advantage of Singapore.\r\n\r\nI will go further into this -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

What type  of  logic\r\n\r\nis  this?  Is  this not the sell-out  logic  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.? Sir, on 15th April, 1963, the front page  of\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times listed \"We stand Pat\"  and  that\r\n\r\nmeant that the Prime Minister was putting up a  very\r\n\r\nfirm stand, in fact, a very unexpectedly firm stand.\r\n\r\nHe  said on that occasion, on the back page  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of  15th April,  that  taxation  and\r\n\r\nrepresentation are closely related. \"Since  we  keep\r\n\r\nmost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  taxes  we, therefore, reduce our representation\r\n\r\nof the Central Parliament by several seats.\" What do\r\n\r\nthese  words  mean? Firstly, Sir, they confirm  what\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis has been  saying  all  along,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that  Singapore does not have  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation and that she has had a  raw  deal  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. merger proposals. Secondly,  they  show\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister himself realises that there\r\n\r\nmust be no taxation without representation. Now,  he\r\n\r\nknowingly,  consciously, voluntarily  and  willingly\r\n\r\nsigned away millions and millions of dollars of  the\r\n\r\npeople's  money  without adequate  and  compensatory\r\n\r\nrepresentation. Sir, simple logic tells us  that  if\r\n\r\nmore  money is given away, naturally the  number  of\r\n\r\nCentral  Parliament  seats  for  Singapore  must  be\r\n\r\nincreased. If giving away $78 million could get  for\r\n\r\nSingapore only 15 seats, surely giving away 2\ufffd times\r\n\r\nthat  amount  should entitle us to 2\ufffd times  15,  or\r\n\r\nround  about  37  seats in the  Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nSince the number of seats remains at 15, is this not\r\n\r\nclear  evidence therefore of a P.A.P. sell-out?  Is\r\n\r\nthis not proof, right from the horse's mouth of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, that he has given away money without\r\n\r\nadequate representation? Of course, money earned  by\r\n\r\nthe  sweat  and toil of the people of Singapore,  as\r\n\r\nwas  so often stressed by the Prime Minister on  his\r\n\r\nconstituency tours, is regarded by the P.A.P. as  of\r\n\r\nminor  and  secondary importance. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  said, \"What is a few millions  between\r\n\r\nfriends?\"  What he really means, in  fact,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nwhat is a few millions of the people's money between\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Ministers and their friends? Is it not  a\r\n\r\nnice  way  of  saying  things?  The  people's  money\r\n\r\nbetween  the P.A.P. Ministers and their friends!  We\r\n\r\ncan  see concrete examples of this P.A.P. philosophy\r\n\r\nin   the   step-by-step  P.A.P. surrender  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation   in   the   financial   cost.   In   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  the Federation,  the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nwilling  to change from payment in one lump sum  and\r\n\r\npayment  only  for Federal services in Singapore  to\r\n\r\npayment  by percentage to the Federation and payment\r\n\r\nfor  Pan-Malayan services. This is a big jump,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWhy this change?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, on the one hand, giving the impression to the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that he was fighting to  retain\r\n\r\nevery cent of the money for Singapore, he agreed, on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  to give more money  away  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  If  this  is not pure  deception,  then\r\n\r\nthere  must  be something radically wrong  with  the\r\n\r\nheads of the P.A.P. Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 25th May, 1963, the Prime Minister had been\r\n\r\ndeceiving  the people with talks of surpluses  which\r\n\r\nhe  claimed  are  the result of a prudent  and  good\r\n\r\ngovernment. We say, Sir, it is nothing of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe early surpluses in Singapore were the result  of\r\n\r\ndownright  inefficient  and incompetent  government.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government has been  too  busy  playing\r\n\r\npolitics. It did not have the time to use the  money\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore and voted for  in  this\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  on construction  projects  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  people  of Singapore. Surplus  means,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  under-expenditure and under-use  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it means inefficient and bad government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back, Sir, to the question we were\r\n\r\ndiscussing.  The  Prime  Minister  was  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  the  Federation  had  wanted  half  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  surplus,  but, of  course,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsurplus of another character. This is a surplus, not\r\n\r\nthe   result  of  under-expenditure  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment over the last three years - $88 million  in\r\n\r\n1960,  $125 million in 1961 and $93 million in 1962,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total  surplus of $304 million  in  three\r\n\r\nyears;  negligence of $304 million  in  three  years\r\n\r\n- but  the  estimated result of an estimated increase\r\n\r\nin  revenue  in the years ahead. Let us  follow  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of events. May I refer to Paper Misc.  4\r\n\r\nof  1963? On page 45, Document III tells us that the\r\n\r\nFederation on 5th of April, 1963, proposed  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of determining the apportionment  that  (1) \r\n\r\nany surplus of Federal revenue after meeting Federal\r\n\r\nservices  in  Singapore will be  used  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nshortfall of Singapore revenue; (2)  to meet  central\r\n\r\nFederal   expenditure  such  as  defence,   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  external affairs, Parliament,  etc.;  and\r\n\r\n(3)   any  balance will be apportioned 50/50  between\r\n\r\nthe two Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it goes on to explain that having determined\r\n\r\nthe amounts from the Federation revenue that will go\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation  Government  and  to  the  State\r\n\r\nGovernment, the ratio of the amounts should be  used\r\n\r\nas  the  ratio for future apportionment.  Since  all\r\n\r\ncalculations  are  based on  the  1961  revenue  and \r\n\r\nexpenditure, and since the ratio calculated  on  the 1961  Federal revenue is 60 per cent Federal and  40\r\n\r\nper  cent State, so apportionment will be Federation\r\n\r\n60  per  cent  and State 40 per cent in all  Federal\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very revealing Document and it shows\r\n\r\nhow  the  Federation Government has been  trying  to\r\n\r\nsoak  Singapore  all the way. And indeed  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  made  use  of  this  fact  to  create  the\r\n\r\nimpression that he was fighting for the interests of\r\n\r\nSingapore. He went from constituency to constituency\r\n\r\ntelling  the people how he was resisting the demands\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation Government, and all the time  he\r\n\r\ntalked of \"surpluses\" by which he sought to give the\r\n\r\nimpression  to  the  people of  Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  was asking for surpluses that  had  come\r\n\r\nabout  as a result of underspending by the politics-playing  P.A.P. Government in 1960, 1961  and  1962.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  game  of  Lee  Kuan Yew-hero-playing-and-creating  went on until 25th May, 1963,  when  in  a\r\n\r\nletter  to the Straits Times Mr Abdullah Bin  Ayub,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Controller  of  Supply  in  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nrevealed that the negotiations were, in fact, on the\r\n\r\npercentage payment of Singapore Federal taxes to the\r\n\r\nFederation. He said that once the percentage payment\r\n\r\nhas been fixed, each Government would be responsible\r\n\r\nfor  its  own budget and the question of deficit  or\r\n\r\nsurplus  does not arise. Sir, this was a great  blow\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. This letter, in fact, says that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister had not been telling the people  the\r\n\r\ntruth,  because all the time it should have  been  a\r\n\r\npercentage but he was talking and telling the people\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  a  matter  of surpluses.  After  this\r\n\r\nFederation  broadside, the P.A.P. had to  completely\r\n\r\nshut  up  on  the  question of  surplus.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, therefore, had to turn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  new  pastures in order to exploit the situation.\r\n\r\nThe payment on a percentage basis was soon confirmed\r\n\r\non  30th May, 1963, when both Governments agreed  in\r\n\r\nprinciple to set up a Common Market. This, so far as\r\n\r\nwe  can  see,  is  a  great retreat  for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause a percentage payment brings with it a built-in  increase  year  by year. This  is  most  clearly\r\n\r\nexplained  by no other than Mr Jek Yuen Thong,  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary to the Prime Minister  himself.\r\n\r\nIn  a letter to the Straits Times of 27th May, 1963,\r\n\r\nMr  Jek  Yuen  Thong pointed out that the  built-in\r\n\r\nincrease  lies in three directions: (1)   by  natural\r\n\r\nincrease  in consumption and so increasing  revenue;\r\n\r\n(2)   by  spread of the number of taxes over a  wider\r\n\r\nrange  of commodities as times goes on; and  (3)   by\r\n\r\nincreasing  in actual level of taxation  over  which\r\n\r\nthe Central Government has legislative authority. We\r\n\r\nsee,  therefore, that this percentage payment  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  disadvantage to Singapore,  however  you  may\r\n\r\nlook at it. It means, in fact, an added extra burden\r\n\r\non  the people of Singapore which increases year  by\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself realised this. He also said there was a difference between 25 per cent of $400 million and 25 per cent of $500 million. He said this on 2nd June, 1963. In his visit to the Punggol Constituency on 3rd June, 1963, he pointed out that one per cent would mean $3 million after Malaysia, $5 million after 5 years, and $8 million\r\n\r\nafter  10 years. Considering the fact that he  knows\r\n\r\nhow  to  calculate in this fashion, he  should  also\r\n\r\nhave known what the giving away of extra millions of\r\n\r\ndollars  means to the people. One would have thought\r\n\r\nthat  he  would indeed have looked after the revenue\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and sought all means  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\npercentage  payment to the Federation. If  this  had\r\n\r\nbeen  done, he would indeed have been able to  claim\r\n\r\nthat  he had fought for the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Facts unfortunately prove otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Prime Minister had got the backing of the\r\n\r\npeople,  he would have the full confidence  and  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the people behind him, and he would have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  put  up a really tough  fight.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, as is evident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  all  the people in Singapore, he does not  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  backing  of  the people, and, consequently,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have the confidence and strength  of  the\r\n\r\npeople behind him. Therefore, he could not have  put\r\n\r\nup  any  real fight. He knows that he is  already  a\r\n\r\ndiscredited politician on his way out. He  had  gone\r\n\r\non  bended knees to the Tunku and it is unlikely, in\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances, that he would be able to get the\r\n\r\nFederation   to  reduce  the  figure  of  percentage\r\n\r\npayment to the Federation. On the contrary, and  not\r\n\r\nunexpectedly, the Prime Minister had to increase the\r\n\r\npercentage figure all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in spite of all this, events apparently came to\r\n\r\na head over the Federation demand of the $50 million\r\n\r\ngrant from Singapore and the so-called Common Market\r\n\r\nterms. Some of the facts were first revealed at  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting of the House on 10th June,  1963.  The\r\n\r\nnewspapers called it drama, and drama followed drama\r\n\r\nuntil  a Federation ultimatum of Malaysia - \"With  or\r\n\r\nWithout Singapore\" - as reported in the Straits Times\r\n\r\non  21st  June,  1963, was handed to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  all  can still remember  the  tense\r\n\r\nmoments of the deadlock in the financial talks.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. on  its  side had played its hand  well  and\r\n\r\nthrough   full  use  of  the  Government  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery  had  tried to create the impression  that\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister was fighting a stubborn rearguard\r\n\r\naction  every  inch  of  the  way.  He  gave   Press\r\n\r\ninterviews,  spoke  over T.V. informing  the  people\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  must have the Common  Market  terms\r\n\r\nwritten  into  the Constitution. He also  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is too poor to play Santa Claus  with  $50\r\n\r\nmillion.  What  a  heroic  posture  for  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister!  If only he was really and truly  fighting\r\n\r\nfor  the  interests of the people of  Singapore  - if\r\n\r\nonly,  I  say.  But,  of course,  this  was  only  a\r\n\r\nposture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events have proved that the Prime Minister was\r\n\r\nmerely putting up a front, an act, a performance  to\r\n\r\nspotlight  his return from London in a  Gilbert  and\r\n\r\nSullivan  traitor-turned-hero farce.  After  he  had\r\n\r\nbeen  summoned by his imperial master to London,  he\r\n\r\nagain staged a prepared comic opera in the London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstage.  There  was news of how he  had  fought,  and\r\n\r\ntonight  he  was  telling us how he fought.  He  was\r\n\r\nreported to have negotiated right through the  night\r\n\r\nand he was even reported to have used anti-Communist\r\n\r\nmethods against Tun Razak and Tan Siew Sin.  To  use\r\n\r\nanti-Communist methods - I do not know what he meant.\r\n\r\nBut   from  what  the  Prime  Minister  himself  has\r\n\r\nrevealed  in  this Chamber tonight, we knew  he  was\r\n\r\neating  sandwiches  and he was drinking  whisky  and\r\n\r\nbrandy. And then there was news of how very near  it\r\n\r\nbecame  a complete breakdown before there was  final\r\n\r\naccord.  And  to some people, Sir - only some  people\r\n\r\n- it  appeared that Lee Kuan Yew was really  fighting\r\n\r\nfor  their interests. Those who do not know  of  the\r\n\r\ncontortionist  agility of Lee Kuan Yew  and  company\r\n\r\nfor  twists and turns might have thought that he was\r\n\r\nreally lighting every inch of the way. But when  the\r\n\r\nbare  essentials of these financial terms were  made\r\n\r\nknown  to  us in Singapore at that time,  it  was  a\r\n\r\ngreat shock o all. All were shocked and amazed  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister should have accepted terms which\r\n\r\nare  so  patently disadvantageous to  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nentirely advantageous to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to London, the Prime Minister had\r\n\r\nalready  told  the  people  in  Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  demanded  40  per  cent  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nnational  revenue. He informed the  people  in  T.V.\r\n\r\nbroadcasts  that  - and he repeated  the  same  thing\r\n\r\nagain tonight - according to Singapore's calculations,\r\n\r\npayment  to the Federation should amount to only  34\r\n\r\nper  cent of Singapore's national revenue. But  - and\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  the difference between the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Singapore Government  on  this\r\n\r\n- while the Federation demand had remained at 40  per\r\n\r\ncent  - no change whatsoever - the P.A.P. had  already\r\n\r\ngiven way and increased the payment from 34 per cent\r\n\r\nto  37  per  cent.  This, Sir, is  now  revealed  in\r\n\r\nDocument  VII on page 55 of Paper Misc. 4  of  1963.\r\n\r\nYou will see in paragraph 3, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Siew Sin is asking for 40% of our national taxes\r\n\r\nwhereas our calculations show only 34.3% is  due  to\r\n\r\nhim, but we are prepared to split the difference and\r\n\r\nsettle at 37%.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  letter was written on 11th June. We know  that\r\n\r\nthis 37 per cent was subsequently further raised  to\r\n\r\n39  per  cent, and then in London the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwent  one step further and increased the 39 per cent\r\n\r\nto  40 per cent - the 40 per cent originally demanded\r\n\r\nof Singapore by the Federation. We can see from this\r\n\r\nalone  how  the  P.A.P. has been  surrendering  the\r\n\r\nrights  of the people of Singapore step by  step  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said that he was pressured both by the United Kingdom and the Federation Governments. But then what else can a stooge do but carry out the instructions of his imperial master? Did he fight back? Did he say that the interests of the people are paramount? No. He just surrendered. Only a matter of percentage, according to the P.A.P. Ministers. And yet this evening, the Prime Minister himself tells us that not even half a point has been given away. From what we can see 34 per cent to 40 per cent is 6 points - not half a point; many points. One point means a lot of money too. I will come to\r\n\r\nthat later. Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal in London, therefore, and I quote the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the Prime Minister himself, is  all  one-sided  to the advantage of the Federation Government\r\n\r\nand fair and just only to the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Prime  Minister  talks  of  fairness  and\r\n\r\njustice, he never thinks of the Singapore people. It\r\n\r\nis  not  fair and just to Singapore. It is fair  and\r\n\r\njust all right to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on an annual national revenue of $310\r\n\r\nmillion  - and  this was quoted by Mr Tan  Siew  Sin\r\n\r\nwhen  he  came back from London - one per cent  works\r\n\r\nout  to  $3.1 million, and 40 per cent works out  to\r\n\r\n$124  million. But, of course, to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nthe percentage is not important, and this is what he\r\n\r\nsaid  in a letter to the Tunku on 22nd June - Document\r\n\r\nIX on page 63. In his letter to the Tunku, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  the percentage is not  important  - I\r\n\r\nstress,  is  not important. I do not  know  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant to him. One per cent, as far as  we  know,\r\n\r\nis $3.1 million. If we work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  our lives, we will never get one-tenth of  that\r\n\r\namount  of  money.  But to the Prime  Minister,  the\r\n\r\npercentage of the money of the people earned through\r\n\r\ntheir  sweat and toil, as so often stressed  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, is not important.  The  only  thing\r\n\r\nimportant is the P.A.P.; that is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing how the P.A.P. has sold out the rights\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore step by step, we can now\r\n\r\nsee  the difference between the White Paper and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Malaysia Agreement in London  on  this  one\r\n\r\nitem  alone. What was originally a lump sum  payment\r\n\r\nto  the Federation of only $78 million per year  for\r\n\r\nFederal  services in Singapore - and which was  stated\r\n\r\nby  the Prime Minister himself to be as low as  only\r\n\r\n$60 million recently - has now become a payment of 40\r\n\r\nper  cent  of Singapore's national revenue amounting\r\n\r\nto  $124  million  per  year and  for  Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\ndefence  - no  more a matter of Malayan defence,  but\r\n\r\nnow  of Pan-Malaysian defence. This amount increases\r\n\r\nyear  by  year,  and  this  is  but  the  beginning,\r\n\r\nbecause, as we shall see, there is more to  pay  for\r\n\r\nSingapore. We know that although the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsays,  on the one hand, that Singapore cannot afford\r\n\r\nto   give   a  $50  million  grant  to  the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories, yet, on the other hand, he is  in  fact\r\n\r\ngiving  more  than  that amount  away  in  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  loan  to  the Federation. $100  million  of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  interest free for the first  five  years.\r\n\r\nanti  this interest-free period can be extended  for\r\n\r\nanother  live  years.  It  means,  of  course,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is giving away an interest-free  loan  of\r\n\r\n$100 million to the Federation for 10 years, because\r\n\r\nif  it can be extended, then, of course, it will  be\r\n\r\nextended. The power does not rest with the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Federation Government has the power.\r\n\r\nAnd any agreement which says that it can be extended\r\n\r\nin  fact  means that it will be extended. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  interest-free period, in fact, is ten years and\r\n\r\nnot  five years, as has been explained by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Simple interest on $100 million  at  five\r\n\r\nand  a half per cent would amount to $55 million  in\r\n\r\nten  years,  i.e. $5.5 million a year. The  compound\r\n\r\ninterest will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount  to much more than that. It is, therefore,  a\r\n\r\nloss of $55 million in ten years and this becomes  a\r\n\r\ndouble  loss  of  $100 million if Singapore  has  to\r\n\r\nborrow money and pay the same or higher interest  on\r\n\r\nthe loan borrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might at this point remind you, Sir, of the $45\r\n\r\nmillion  World  Bank  loan given  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the power station project.  In  that\r\n\r\nloan  given to Singapore by the World Bank, all  the\r\n\r\nmost   humiliating  terms  are  exacted   from   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government. Singapore has to buy  all  the\r\n\r\nmaterials through the World Bank; Singapore  has  to\r\n\r\nemploy a super engineer who will probably, as far as\r\n\r\nI  understand, earn a salary of $6,000 a  year,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore   has   again   to  employ   supplementary\r\n\r\npersonnel to help this super engineer, again through\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank, and, on top of that, has to  assure\r\n\r\npayment  of an interest of at least eight per  cent;\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time  mortgaging  all  the  Municipal\r\n\r\nproperties of Singapore to the World Bank for a mere\r\n\r\npittance of $45 million. All our Singapore Municipal\r\n\r\nproperties,  worth much more than that, millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars, all mortgaged to the World Bank. Why do  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  borrow all that money when  Singapore  has\r\n\r\n$400  million  in  the kitty?  We  have  asked  this\r\n\r\nquestion  many times. The Singapore Government  - the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  - has not been able to answer that  question.\r\n\r\nWe hope they might provide an answer and we will see\r\n\r\nwhat they have to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me come back to this $150 million loan to\r\n\r\nthe Federation. This is a completely new item and is\r\n\r\nnot found anywhere in the White Paper. But, as I was\r\n\r\nsaying,   what  is  most  puzzling  and   completely\r\n\r\ninexplicable to the people of Singapore is that,  on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, the P.A.P. has to borrow $45 million\r\n\r\nfor the power station project from the World Bank on\r\n\r\nsuch  humiliating terms, and even to borrow  another\r\n\r\n$70  million for the Johore River project,  probably\r\n\r\non the same terms; on the other hand, the P.A.P. can\r\n\r\nloan $150 million of the people of Singapore's money\r\n\r\nto the Federation, $100 million of which is interest\r\n\r\nfree. If it is found necessary that Singapore has to\r\n\r\nborrow, then elementary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlogic tells us that Singapore cannot afford to lend.\r\n\r\nSo  what type of reason and logic says that although\r\n\r\nwe  have to borrow, we still can afford to lend?  Is\r\n\r\nthis  the  logic of the Finance Minister  who  says,\r\n\r\n\"What is a few millions between friends?\", or is  it\r\n\r\nthe  logic  of  the Prime Minister  who  says,  \"The\r\n\r\npercentage is not important.\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many people who openly say that this\r\n\r\nloan is an eyewash. They say, it is not a loan.  The\r\n\r\nword  \"loan\"  is  only an euphemism  for  the  words\r\n\r\n\"outright  gift\". The Member for Anson  has  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that when the time comes for repayment  of  the\r\n\r\nloan,  Singapore will not be in a position to demand\r\n\r\nsuch  a  repayment.  The  loan,  is,  therefore,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  a  gift,  a tribute from a  vassal  to  his\r\n\r\noverlord.  The vassal, in the person  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore, has to pay a tribute  to  his\r\n\r\noverlord, the Prime Minister of the Federation,  for\r\n\r\nhelping the Prime Minister of Singapore to crush his\r\n\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims that he has not given away $150 million in an outright grant. But has the Prime Minister really saved the money as he has claimed? To us, money is only meant for use for development to raise the living standards of the people. Money invested abroad is of no use to all of us in Singapore. Put to proper use, however, the\r\n\r\n$150  million  loan  is worth  more  than  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  outright  grant. This is confirmed  by  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  and by no other person than  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself in his letter to the Tunku on  22nd\r\n\r\nJune. 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 4 of 1963,\r\n\r\nDocument  IX, page 63? In the fourth paragraph,  the\r\n\r\nlast sentence reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And loans from Singapore for North Borneo and\r\n\r\nSarawak's development up to $150 million will give a\r\n\r\ngreater impetus on their economic growth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was referring to why he did not want to give the\r\n\r\n$50  million grant. But, in comparison, he says  the\r\n\r\n$150  million  loan will give a greater  impetus  on\r\n\r\ntheir  economic  growth. This is an  open  admission\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  given  away, in  fact,  more  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation than the $50\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion which he said he was trying to save. So  how\r\n\r\nhas  the  P.A.P. saved any money for the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  He  is  merely  pretending   to   refuse\r\n\r\npayment.  He  is only saying, \"No\", with  one  hand,\r\n\r\nwhen in fact he gives more generously away with  the\r\n\r\nother hand. The Prime Minister knows how to say that\r\n\r\nthe  $150 million can be used to build 13 blocks  of\r\n\r\nSelegie House and can be used also to metal all  the\r\n\r\nroads  and  to  light  up all  the  rural  areas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So, why does he not keep back  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion for development in Singapore? Why is it that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  to loan the money  to  others,  when\r\n\r\nSingapore itself needs to borrow more and more money\r\n\r\nfor  its  own  development? Since 1963, five  loans,\r\n\r\ntotalling  nearly  $250 million in  all,  have  been\r\n\r\nfloated  in  Singapore. This  was  revealed  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister only last week. Why float loans for\r\n\r\nthe development of Singapore on the one hand and yet\r\n\r\nloan   money  away  for  the  development  o   other\r\n\r\nterritories on the other hand? Is this not absurd?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. has invested our money abroad to\r\n\r\nhelp develop other already developed countries.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. explain why a poorly developed  country,\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore,  must use its  own  money  to  help\r\n\r\ndevelop  more  advanced countries,  like  Australia,\r\n\r\nCanada,  England? Why? Is this the logic the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  talked about? Is it logical to give money  away\r\n\r\nwhen   the  people  of  Singapore  need  the   money\r\n\r\nthemselves?  Is this not the logic of traitors?  And\r\n\r\ndoes  the Prime Minister know what the $110  million\r\n\r\nlost in the interest-free loan mean to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore? I will just quote a few examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Singapore can easily use the money to\r\n\r\nbuy  over the Singapore Traction Company. This  will\r\n\r\nimmediately stop further exploitation of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore by foreign monopoly capital.  It  will\r\n\r\nstop  all  remittances of profits from Singapore  to\r\n\r\nareas outside Singapore. Why does he not do that? it\r\n\r\ndoes  not even cost $10 million. Why give away  $110\r\n\r\nmillion in interest-free loans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, to quote another example, with this $110\r\n\r\nmillion  we can allow 100,000 families to stay  rent\r\n\r\nfree in $20 per month housing units for six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, another example: free secondary education for\r\n\r\n300,000  students at $4 per month for  eight  years.\r\n\r\nYes, the $110 million can be used for quite a lot of\r\n\r\nthings  besides  building Selegie  House,  metalling\r\n\r\nroads, installing lights. We can reduce the rents in\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board flats in Singapore. We  can  give\r\n\r\nfree  education to our students. We  can  give  more\r\n\r\nscholarships.  Oh, so many things.  If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nthink  of our taxi-drivers, trishaw-riders,  hawkers\r\n\r\nand  market stall-holders, we could give  them  free\r\n\r\nlicences  for  hundreds of years.  For  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nyears,  they will not have to pay licences.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the Harbour Board, for example, with  that\r\n\r\nmoney,  Singapore can easily give $100 increase  per\r\n\r\nworker  per  month  to  the 10.000  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board for ten years.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have to wait until now, after 4 years  of\r\n\r\nnon-recognition, before promising to pay $2  million\r\n\r\nto  the  S.H.B. workers and  call  it  a  so-called\r\n\r\nMalaysian  bonus - that has not even been given  yet.\r\n\r\nSo  you can see, Sir, what the P.A.P. Government has\r\n\r\nbeen doing to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage the P,A.P. has surrendered to the\r\n\r\nFederation  the  basic interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Let  me  now touch on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  control. At one stage  of  the  financial\r\n\r\ntalks, the Prime Minister took a strong stand on the\r\n\r\nmatter of control of Singapore's finances. On  this,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister said on 7th March,  1963,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  keep  all  her  revenue.   And   he\r\n\r\nexplained  that \"the word `keep' does not  mean  get\r\n\r\nback  from  Kuala  Lumpur.\" He further  stressed  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How can Singapore, as agreed in the White Paper,\r\n\r\npay a contribution for Federal services, if she does\r\n\r\nnot collect and keep it in the first instance?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When  I first read that, it sounded very logical  to\r\n\r\nme,  and I was wondering what the Prime Minister was\r\n\r\nup  to.  Undoubtedly,  those  words  had  given  the\r\n\r\nimpression to the people of Singapore that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was going to stand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirm  on this question. Being a lawyer, he knew what\r\n\r\nhe  was talking about. On 23rd March, 1963, he  went\r\n\r\neven  one  stage  further to stress that  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  collect,  keep  and pay.\"  Therefore,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of who is to control the machinery for  the\r\n\r\ncollection of revenue in Singapore, as was posed  by\r\n\r\nMr  Tan Siew Sin, our own Prime Minister here tells\r\n\r\nthe  people  that  it is Singapore  that  must  have\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  money collected in  Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  later on, as is typical of P.A.P.'s  twists\r\n\r\nand  turns,  the Minister for Finance  said  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  on  17th  April,  1963,  that   \"who\r\n\r\ncontrols  the  revenue  of  Singapore  is   not   so\r\n\r\nimportant.\"  By  this,  already  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance  admits that the Federation has  control  of\r\n\r\nthe  revenue of Singapore. But this did not  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister from saying something completely\r\n\r\nthe  opposite.  In an interview televised  over  the\r\n\r\nB.B.C.   Panorama  on  6th  May,  1963,  he   stated\r\n\r\ncategorically:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have got to collect the revenue to be able to\r\n\r\nspend it in the way we want.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  are  very firm words, Sir. And  when  he  was\r\n\r\nasked the question: \"So control over finance will be\r\n\r\na   minimum  condition  for  your  going  into   the\r\n\r\nFederation?\".  The Prime Minister  said,  \"Oh,  yes,\r\n\r\nabsolutely basic.\" That is what he said, \"Absolutely\r\n\r\nbasic.  Control  over  finance  will  be  a  minimum\r\n\r\ncondition for going into the Federation, and that is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  basic.\"  What  has  happened   to   this\r\n\r\n\"absolutely   basic\"   control   over   finance   in\r\n\r\nSingapore? As far as we can see, it was not  even  a\r\n\r\npuff of smoke. It was gone with the wind even before\r\n\r\nit  came into existence. This financial control  was\r\n\r\nonly a fiction conjured up by the Prime Minister  to\r\n\r\nallow him to deceive the people. It served him as  a\r\n\r\nfalse   front   in  his  horse  trading   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Are we not now controlled in toto by the\r\n\r\nFederation?  Are  we not going into  the  Federation\r\n\r\nbound  hand and foot? Or is this another example  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. logic  and cold reason? From the  absolutely\r\n\r\nbasic  and  minimum  condition for  going  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation, as laid down by no other person than the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister himself, he is now willing to act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly as the Federation's revenue collector. This  is\r\n\r\na  complete  P.A.P. surrender to  the  Federation's\r\n\r\nultimatum  of  20th June, 1963. To  save  face,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,   in  the  Singapore  paragraph-to-paragraph\r\n\r\nreply to the Federation Government's proposals,  may\r\n\r\nI refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 4 of 1963, page 65:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Singapore Government agrees in principle with\r\n\r\nthe proposal to delegate authority in respect of the\r\n\r\ncollection of Customs and Excise duty and Income Tax\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore  Government  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nArticle 80 (4)....'. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He agrees to it straightaway, although all along the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has been saying that control over finance  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  basic  and  that  this  is  the  minimum\r\n\r\ncondition for going into the Federation. But  if  we\r\n\r\nwere to go further down, the P.A.P. also says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, this delegation of authority should be\r\n\r\nstated  in the Constitution that such delegation  of\r\n\r\nauthority  shall not be revocable except  by  mutual\r\n\r\nagreement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I do not know about \"shall not be revocable\". Let us\r\n\r\nsee  what  the Federation reply is to  that.  It  is\r\n\r\ncontained  in paragraph 5 of Annex J on page  75  of\r\n\r\nPaper Misc. 4 of 1963 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of the Annex to this\r\n\r\nAgreement,  executive authority in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\ncollection in Singapore of customs duties and excise\r\n\r\nand  income tax shall be delegated to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yes,   \"delegated  to  the  Singapore   Government\".\r\n\r\nCorrect:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government may revoke this authority\r\n\r\n[that is the point, Sir] if the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nfails to comply with any direction properly given to\r\n\r\nit  by the Federal Government for the collection  or\r\n\r\nprotection of these taxes or shows itself  unwilling\r\n\r\nor unable to discharge these functions efficiently.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There you are. It even goes further to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This authority may extend to customs duties and\r\n\r\nother   charges  collected  in  Singapore  on  goods\r\n\r\nexported  from  or  to  be  imported  into  Malaysia\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  to  say,  Sir, Singapore can  collect  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  only  at  the pleasure  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. If at any time the Federation Government\r\n\r\nfeels  so  inclined, it can take over the collection\r\n\r\nof   all   Federal  revenue  itself.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment collects only if the Federation allows it\r\n\r\nto   collect.   That   is  all.  Absolute   control,\r\n\r\ntherefore, is in the hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, and Singapore is now  only  the\r\n\r\noffice-boy or rent-collector of the Federation. What\r\n\r\nof  the  brave words of the Prime Minister  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"We must collect and keep and pay.\"?  Is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. logic to talk tough and surrender  abjectly?\r\n\r\nIs  this  P.A.P. logic not the logic of stooges  and\r\n\r\nslaves'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the main items which are manifestly\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous  to Singapore. The only  consolation\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  for the loss of control  of  its  own\r\n\r\nrevenue  is  an  agreement that  all  Federal  taxes\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore will be paid into a  separate\r\n\r\nfund and this fund would be divided annually between\r\n\r\nthe two Governments in the proportion of 60 per cent\r\n\r\nto Singapore and 40 per cent to the Federation. This\r\n\r\nis  mentioned in page 57 in Document VIII dated 20th\r\n\r\nJune,  1963,  in a letter from the Federation  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   to  the  Prime  Minister  of   Singapore.\r\n\r\nParagraph 3 (a)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All taxes collected in Singapore, other than those\r\n\r\nspecified  below, will be paid into a separate  fund\r\n\r\nand  the fund would be divided annually between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments,  or more frequently  by  agreement\r\n\r\nbetween the two Governments in the proportion of 60%\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore Government and 40% to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is meant, in fact, to save face for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\non  its  stand on the question of financial  control\r\n\r\nwhere the P.A.P. has completely given in. There  are\r\n\r\nalso comparatively minor items like profits from the\r\n\r\nCurrency   Board  and  the  Federation  and   Borneo\r\n\r\ncontributions  to Singapore for common  services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. These are referred to in pages 19 and  20\r\n\r\nof  the same Paper. Paragraph 51, on page 19,  talks\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation  and Borneo in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\npayment  to  Singapore  for  common  services;   and\r\n\r\nparagraph  52, on page 20, talks of the  profits  of\r\n\r\nthe  Currency  Board which amount to $10  million  a\r\n\r\nyear.  Singapore, therefore, has in fact now  waived\r\n\r\nits  claim  to monies from both these sources  which\r\n\r\namount to more than $12\ufffd million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 49, Sir, at the bottom - Apportionment\r\n\r\nPercentages. No. 3 says: \"...currency profits  of  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.\"  Therefore, the P.A.P. has  gone  yet  one\r\n\r\nstep further and it is now ready to pay for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  share of even Pan-Malaysia expenditure. The final\r\n\r\narrangements  will come into operation  on  the  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1963. The promise of a review on the  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1965, and subsequently every two years will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to safeguard Singapore's interests,  as\r\n\r\nhoped for by the Prime Minister. He will not be able\r\n\r\nto  safeguard them because the independent  assessor\r\n\r\nwill  always  place the interests of the  Federation\r\n\r\nfirst and those of the State second. It is a natural\r\n\r\ncourse  of  events. It is bound to  be  so.  So  the\r\n\r\nassessor, however independent, will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interests of Singapore. In every  way,\r\n\r\ntherefore, Singapore will be at a disadvantage.  All\r\n\r\nthe  lifeblood  of  Singapore  will  be  subject  to\r\n\r\nFederation overall control, and it is quite  obvious\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore has the worse  of  the\r\n\r\nbargain in every respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first summarise the results of the financial\r\n\r\nmerger talks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What was supposed to be a lump sum payment for\r\n\r\nFederal services in Singapore in 1961 has now become\r\n\r\na  percentage payment for Pan-Malaysian services  in\r\n\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What was calculated by the P.A.P. Government as\r\n\r\npayment  to  the  Federation  of  34  per  cent   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  national  revenue  has  now  become   a\r\n\r\npayment of 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What was originally a lump sum payment of only\r\n\r\n$78  million  per  year  now  becomes  a  percentage\r\n\r\npayment  amounting to $124 million  which  increases\r\n\r\nyear by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The P.A.P. says Singapore cannot afford to give\r\n\r\na  grant  of  $150 million, but finally  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngives  a loan of $150 million, $100 million of which\r\n\r\nis  interest  free. The $150 million is  worth  more\r\n\r\nthan the $50 million grant in development planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) From a bold stand of \"must collect, and keep\r\n\r\nand  pay\", the P.A.P. is now willing to be only  the\r\n\r\noffice boy and rent-collector of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. says categorically that the free\r\n\r\nport  status after merger would remain. Now the free\r\n\r\nport  status will be confined to Blakang Mati  after\r\n\r\n12 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the free port status reduced to the size\r\n\r\nof Blakang Mati - I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have  got the summary ahead of time. I will  keep\r\n\r\nthis  little back, and I will come back to it again.\r\n\r\nLet  me  first deal with this common market and  the\r\n\r\nfree port status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having been exposed that it has surrendered\r\n\r\nto  the Federation on every issue, the P.A.P. plays\r\n\r\nup  the  common market as a special prize  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  got  for the people of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. claims that the interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have been safe-guarded and that the common\r\n\r\nmarket  terms are all written into the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. claims  that  with  the  common  market\r\n\r\nSingapore  will prosper, the jobless will get  jobs,\r\n\r\nand all the problems of Singapore will be solved and\r\n\r\neveryone will be happy. Is this true? What  are  the\r\n\r\nfacts?  A  first  glance tells us  that  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket which the P.A.P. has got for Singapore is the\r\n\r\nmost  unusual  and uncommon common  market,  and  it\r\n\r\npractically writes \"finis\" to the entrepot trade  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the lifeblood of our people for the  last\r\n\r\n150  years. From the very beginning we have  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  the  P.A.P. merger  terms  did  not  even\r\n\r\nprovide  for  a common market between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  The P.A.P. had not  been  able  to\r\n\r\nanswer this during the time of the merger debate  in\r\n\r\n1961.  Repeated questions inside the Assembly  later\r\n\r\nmerely extracted from the P.A.P. Ministers equivocal\r\n\r\nanswers which were neither here nor there. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister raised the Common Market terms only because\r\n\r\nof our constant criticism. Only on 13th April, 1963,\r\n\r\nwas  this question of the Common Market revealed  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  for  th.3  first time.  The  Federation\r\n\r\nFinance Minister confirmed that this was an entirely\r\n\r\nnew  item,  never discussed before in the  financial\r\n\r\nmerger  talks  between the Federation and  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments. This only proves that what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nchooses to consider as the most important comes only\r\n\r\nas  an  after-thought as a result of our  criticism.\r\n\r\nHowever, this Common Market question soon became  an\r\n\r\nitem of major importance in the financial talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th May, 1963, it was reported that both\r\n\r\nGovernments  had agreed in principle on  the  Common\r\n\r\nMarket, and on the following day the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannounced with a guilty conscience that \"this is not\r\n\r\nthe  end of the free port status in Singapore.\" What\r\n\r\nare  the  facts?  Let us see what  Annex  J  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Agreement says. Section 1 (1)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government, .... shall progressively\r\n\r\nestablish a common market in Malaysia....'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  it is envisaged that the Common Market will  be\r\n\r\nfully established at the end of 12 years. By the end\r\n\r\nof  that  period, the free port status of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  disappeared. At  present  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is a free port, i.e. all 224 square  miles\r\n\r\nof Singapore is a free port. What does the free port\r\n\r\nstatus of Singapore mean? It means, as explained  by\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister a couple of years  back,  that\r\n\r\napart  from  revenue duties on tobacco,  liquor  and\r\n\r\npetroleum,  goods  can  be imported  into  Singapore\r\n\r\nwithout  any import duties, and these have benefited\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  two  ways.  First,  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are able to buy more goods  cheaply;  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  there  is  no duty  on  textiles,  shoes,\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs, and so on. The prices of such goods will\r\n\r\nbe   cheaper  in  Singapore  as  compared  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya where there are import  duties.\r\n\r\nThe  second benefit is to our traders. Much  of  our\r\n\r\nimports   are   re-exported  to   the   neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories, e.g. the Federation, Sumatra,  Sarawak,\r\n\r\nBorneo. Without the import duties our merchants  can\r\n\r\nbuy  cheaply and sell to these territories  cheaply.\r\n\r\nThis   is  how  our  entrepot  trade  prospers.   It\r\n\r\ntherefore  follows  that when  any  import  duty  is\r\n\r\nlevied  in  Singapore,  the  free  port  status   is\r\n\r\naffected. Similarly, import duties can be levied  on\r\n\r\nall   sorts  of  consumer  goods,  e.g. toothbrush,\r\n\r\ntoothpaste,  shoes, polish, pencils, and  so  on.  A\r\n\r\nfree  port  status means a cheap cost of living  for\r\n\r\nthe  people. Now in 12 years or less all  the  cheap\r\n\r\nliving will become things of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Section 4 (2)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Revenue duties in force in Singapore on 1st July,\r\n\r\n1963,  and the corresponding duties in force in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya shalt be harmonised as soon  as\r\n\r\npracticable.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words,  Sir, revenue  duties  on  petrol,\r\n\r\nliquor, and tobacco will be harmonised. The price of\r\n\r\npetrol is the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  both sides of the Causeway today. But the prices\r\n\r\nof diesel oil, alcohol and tobacco are higher in the\r\n\r\nFederation than in Singapore today. This, therefore,\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the prices of diesel oil, alcohol,  and\r\n\r\ntobacco will be raised, and cost more for the man in\r\n\r\nthe  street in Singapore. The taxi-driver,  the  bus\r\n\r\ntraveller, will have to spend more money in order to\r\n\r\ngo  about  their daily work. The earnings  of  taxi-drivers will correspondingly decrease. Where  a  man\r\n\r\ncould afford three pints of beer before -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Like the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, like the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nwill be able to afford only two pints. A smoker will\r\n\r\nhave  to spend more on his daily smokes and he  will\r\n\r\nhave  correspondingly less money for  house-keeping.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what will happen when Singapore loses  its\r\n\r\nfree  port status. Is this what we want? Where  else\r\n\r\nhad  the  P.A.P. said about the free port status  in\r\n\r\n1961  and  1962? It is laid down in the White  Paper\r\n\r\n(first paragraph of section 17) that \"the free  port\r\n\r\nstatus  of Singapore ... will not be changed  without\r\n\r\nthe   concurrence  of  both  the  Federal  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Governments.\"  In  the  Merger  and  Your\r\n\r\nFuture  leaflet put out by the P.A.P.,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture publication No. 1/62 printed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government Printing Office, Singapore, it  says\r\n\r\nhere  under  the  heading \"Your Right  and  Benefits\r\n\r\nBefore  and  After Merger\", the item is  \"Free  Port\r\n\r\nStatus  for Singapore\" and under the column  \"Before\r\n\r\nMerger\"  it says \"Yes\", and under the column  \"After\r\n\r\nMerger\", it also says \"Yes\". Therefore, there should\r\n\r\nbe  no  change  so far as the free  port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in another Merger and Your Rights leaflet,\r\n\r\nalso from the Ministry of Culture, No. 5/62, it says\r\n\r\nhere on the back page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Business Opportunities: Singapore retains her free\r\n\r\nport status after merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a forum sponsored by the Chinese Chamber of\r\n\r\nCommerce  on the 13th January, 1962, a question  was\r\n\r\nasked,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If  after merger the Central Government of the  new\r\n\r\nFederation  by  levying taxes affect the  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus   of   Singapore,  what  measures   can   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  adopt  to face the  situation?\"  A  very\r\n\r\nsimple  question. The question was, \"If after merger\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Government of the  new  Federation  by\r\n\r\nlevying  taxes  affect  the  free  port  status   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, what measures can the Government adopt to\r\n\r\nface  the  situation?\" And the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nanswered,  \"The  Central Government cannot  do  this\r\n\r\nwithout  the  agreement of the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nof course. The situation envisaged by the questioner\r\n\r\ndoes  not therefore arise.\" What a wonderful way  of\r\n\r\nanswering a question. The logical interpretation and\r\n\r\nimplication  of  this  answer  is  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  not agree to  any  measures  that\r\n\r\nwould  affect  the  free port status  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnybody reading an answer like this must come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion that the Singapore Government  would  not\r\n\r\nchange the free port status of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out, the P.A.P. further\r\n\r\nconfirmed  this  with  stout  assurances  that   the\r\n\r\npresent  free port status will remain after  merger.\r\n\r\nThus  we  can  see  that the P.A.P. have  repeatedly\r\n\r\ngiven  assurances  that  the  free  port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  remain. But what is happening  now?\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the  Malaysia  Agreement  signed   in\r\n\r\nLondon,  Singapore will not continue to  be  a  free\r\n\r\nport.  And  by the end of 12 years, if the agreement\r\n\r\nis  really  put into effect, the only free  port  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  in  the  domain  of  Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nconfined to the island of Blakang Mati. A free  port\r\n\r\nstatus  of  224  square miles of Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to  658 acres of Blakang Mati.  658  acres,\r\n\r\ndoes it come to any square mile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this referendum leaflet given out by\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore - again it is a Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture  publication, No. 8/62.  And  concerning\r\n\r\nfree port, it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What does Alternative A mean? It means Singapore\r\n\r\nwill continue to be a free port.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is what it says here in this leaflet. Is  this\r\n\r\nnot  deception?  Has  the P.A.P. not  deceived  the\r\n\r\npeople?  Surely, the people did not  - even  assuming\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey really did vote for Alternative A - vote for what\r\n\r\nis now in the Malaysia Agreement. Then we might ask:\r\n\r\nWhat will happen to our free port trade? The tourist\r\n\r\ntrade  flourishes only in a free port. If  the  free\r\n\r\nport  status  is  reduced to the Island  of  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati,  then  the  tourist  trade  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nconfined to Blakang Mati.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rueff Report in page 78, paragraph 196,\r\n\r\nestimates  that the tourist trade in  Singapore  can\r\n\r\namount to anything like $100 million a year. It says\r\n\r\nhere in the last sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is impossible to estimate the value of these\r\n\r\ntransactions;  but, on the basis of the  indications\r\n\r\nobtained  from  the  trade, it is  likely  that  the\r\n\r\nunrecorded transactions taken as a whole may  be  as\r\n\r\nhigh as M$100 million.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another $100 million gone down the drain. Then what\r\n\r\nof  the small traders and shop-keepers who depend on\r\n\r\nthis  tourist trade? It does look as if the  traders\r\n\r\nin  High Street, South Bridge Road, Change Alley and\r\n\r\neven  Raffles  Square  will have  to  look  for  new\r\n\r\nsources of income. They may even have to close down.\r\n\r\nThose gainfully employed may find themselves without\r\n\r\njobs  in  the not too distant future. All thanks  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 sub-clause (3) of the Malaysia\r\n\r\nConstitution  says that until 31st  December,  1968,\r\n\r\nthat is five years from now, no new revenue duty can\r\n\r\nbe  imposed  without the consent  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. But in the second five-year period, that\r\n\r\nis,  from  the 1st January, 1969, to 31st  December,\r\n\r\n1975,  Singapore  can  refuse to  agree  to  heavier\r\n\r\nduties only (and this is a very important thing)  on\r\n\r\npayment  of compensation on non-imposition  of  such\r\n\r\nduties  in  Singapore. After the 31st  of  December,\r\n\r\n1975,   that  is  after  12  years,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot withhold consent to imposition  of\r\n\r\nwhatever duty the Federation may wish to impose.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  duties  will be imposed  on  consumer\r\n\r\ngoods  after  five years at any time the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment chooses to do so. If the duties  are  not\r\n\r\npaid for directly by the individual consumer or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe trader, then the duties will have to be paid for\r\n\r\nindirectly  from  Government revenue,  which,  after\r\n\r\nall, is also collected from the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, either way, the people of Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what of the protective duties? Protective\r\n\r\nduties  already imposed are not very many in number.\r\n\r\nWell-known  examples are protective duties  on  soap\r\n\r\nand  paint. But there are protective duties on  many\r\n\r\nitems  of  goods  in  the Federation.  For  example,\r\n\r\nmedicines, tyres, batteries - you can name any number\r\n\r\nof items. Those who have travelled from Singapore to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will know how much it costs them  in\r\n\r\nordinary  day-to-day goods. We get cheaper medicine,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  in Singapore. Once you  go  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  you have to pay, and pay  through  your\r\n\r\nnose  too.  It  is, I think, a 20  to  30  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease  in price and naturally therefore the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living of the people will correspondingly go  up\r\n\r\nwith  the imposition of these new protective duties.\r\n\r\nOf course, this will not affect those who are in the\r\n\r\nfront row of the PAP. Government - they are well  off\r\n\r\nenough. All of them have new cars. But to those  who\r\n\r\nalready  find it difficult to make both  ends  meet,\r\n\r\nthis extra duty on consumer goods will mean an extra\r\n\r\nburden  and greater hardship. Is this what we  want?\r\n\r\nMoreover,  any  increase  in  price  on  goods   and\r\n\r\nproducts  in every-day use will have its  effect  on\r\n\r\nother  connected  goods,  thus  creating  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle  leading  to  increased cost  of  living  all\r\n\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see, therefore, that after Malaysia is pushed\r\n\r\nthrough the free port status of Singapore will  very\r\n\r\nrapidly diminish. The free port of Singapore will be\r\n\r\nshrunk  in  size from the whole island of Singapore,\r\n\r\n224  square  miles, to the size  of  the  island  of\r\n\r\nBlakang Mati, which is only 658 acres, about half  a\r\n\r\nmile  from Singapore. In order that the poor  people\r\n\r\nmay  get  a cheaper living - if they still want  that\r\n\r\ncheaper living - they will have to go to Blakang Mati\r\n\r\nand  stay  there.  Otherwise they  will  not  get  a\r\n\r\ncheaper  living.  If  a person  from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nmainland goes to Blakang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMati  to  buy  cheaper goods, he will  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nduties  on  those same goods on return to Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what it means. Everybody's cost of  living\r\n\r\nwill increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, the P.A.P. Front benches do not have to\r\n\r\nworry;  they have enough money. There are  not  many\r\n\r\npeople  who  have so much money. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsays  he will build bonded warehouses in the Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  area  and  in  Telok  Ayer  Basin.  But   how\r\n\r\npractical  is  this  proposition? Already  Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  are complaining that this  will  hinder\r\n\r\nthe  trade  of  Singapore.  Building  warehouses  in\r\n\r\nBlakang  Mati itself would mean additional costs  in\r\n\r\nstorage and transport from the Singapore mainland to\r\n\r\nBlakang  Mati  and back again from Blakang  Mati  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. As pointed out on the 10th of July in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times,  there is also the fear  that  banks\r\n\r\nwould not guarantee the goods once bonded warehouses\r\n\r\nare introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a large portion of the goods for the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is  kept  in warehouses owned by  the  banks,\r\n\r\nwhich  also  provide the credit facilities  for  the\r\n\r\ntraders.  Entrepot traders fear that  having  bonded\r\n\r\nwarehouses would mean taking the goods away from the\r\n\r\nbanks,  leaving  them nothing for  security  on  the\r\n\r\ncredit.  So  how  will  the  P.A.P. overcome   this\r\n\r\ndifficulty? Does the P.A.P. itself intend to provide\r\n\r\nthe  credit facilities and so take over the role  of\r\n\r\nbanks  in Singapore? If that is so, then the  people\r\n\r\nmust  be  informed  about this. P.A.P. philantrophy\r\n\r\nwith other people's money is now well known. So  let\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. inform the people what it intends to do.\r\n\r\nBuilding  a  large number of bonded  warehouses  and\r\n\r\ncharging  very  cheap rentals will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsolve  all the problems. First of all, there is  not\r\n\r\nenough space in the Harbour Board area. And how many\r\n\r\nbonded warehouses are they going to keep? People who\r\n\r\nnormally go to High Street will not be able to go to\r\n\r\nbonded  warehouses to buy things.  And  the  tourist\r\n\r\ntrade in Singapore will suffer greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the P.A.P. says that there is a Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory Board. This Board is meant to advise on the\r\n\r\nestablishment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  maintenance  of a common external  tariff,  but\r\n\r\nappointments to this Tariff Advisory Board shall  be\r\n\r\nmade  by the Federation Government, and that is  the\r\n\r\nrub. Singapore will be able to nominate only one  of\r\n\r\nthree Deputy Chairmen for the first five years,  not\r\n\r\nafter  that. The whole Board, in fact,  will  be  so\r\n\r\nweighed  on the side of the Federation that  in  any\r\n\r\nclash  of  interests  between  the  Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  there certainly will  be,  Singapore\r\n\r\ninterests  cannot  but suffer.  Thus,  even  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  the Tariff Advisory Board the advantages\r\n\r\nare entirely on the side of the Federation. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to help Singapore. How will this help  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore industrialisation when Federation\r\n\r\ninterests will always come first and Singapore State\r\n\r\ninterests will always come second?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to protective duties on goods\r\n\r\nimported, their Government can also impose a special\r\n\r\nproduction  tax on producers in a low  tariff  state\r\n\r\nand   an  export  duty  on  primary  products.  This\r\n\r\nproduction  tax on producers in a low  tariff  state\r\n\r\nand  export duty on primary products are, of course,\r\n\r\nmeant   to  protect  Federation  industries  against\r\n\r\nSingapore  industries. An example of production  tax\r\n\r\nwas  given in our Barisan statement on the  13th  of\r\n\r\nJuly,  1963.  If the production cost of  a  pair  of\r\n\r\nshoes  in  the  Federation is,  say,  $1.50  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  only $1.00, then a production tax  of  50\r\n\r\ncents will be imposed on Singapore shoes in order to\r\n\r\nprotect the shoe industries in the Federation.  That\r\n\r\nis  what  production tax means. Everything  produced\r\n\r\ncheaply here will have a production tax added on  to\r\n\r\nit in order to give the industries in the Federation\r\n\r\na  chance to compete evenly and equally. Of  course,\r\n\r\nall  this can only work to the disadvantage  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the production costs, and so\r\n\r\nthe  selling price of eggs. If eggs sell at 10 cents\r\n\r\nin the Federation and only 9 cents in Singapore, for\r\n\r\nexample,  then a duty of 1 cent will be  imposed  on\r\n\r\neach Singapore egg in order to level up the price of\r\n\r\neggs  to  10  cents  in  both  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  This, in fact, puts Singapore  products\r\n\r\nat  a  great  disadvantage since the extra  cost  of\r\n\r\ntransport - this is a new item - will mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Singapore eggs will sell at a dearer price than\r\n\r\nthat  of  Federation  eggs  in  the  Federation  and\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore. In both instances, it  can  mean\r\n\r\nonly a rise in the cost of living for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 3 (2) of Annex J allows the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to impose or vary  protective\r\n\r\nduties on Singapore at any time, even without  prior\r\n\r\nreference to the Tariff Advisory Board. You may have\r\n\r\na  Board, but they do not have to consult the Board.\r\n\r\nWhether  they  do  it that way  or  not  is  another\r\n\r\nmatter,  but the powers are there. They can  do  it.\r\n\r\nWhen  new  protective  duties  are  imposed  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  clause  3  (3)   allows  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to delay the imposition of the  tax,  but\r\n\r\nnot  reject it, and that only for a period of up  to\r\n\r\n12  months,  not  after  that.  After  the  12-month\r\n\r\nperiod, the new protective duties will be imposed on\r\n\r\nSingapore,  however  the  people  of  Singapore  may\r\n\r\nobject and protest. There is nothing we can do about\r\n\r\nit.  If  the Federation Government decides to impose\r\n\r\nthese  taxes on Singapore after the 12-month period,\r\n\r\nthat  is all there is to it. We may protest  but  we\r\n\r\nshall have to cough up. And in addition, during  the\r\n\r\n12  months,  when Singapore can delay the imposition\r\n\r\nof  these  duties,  the Singapore Government  cannot\r\n\r\ngrant  any pioneer certificate to any industry which\r\n\r\nmay  be  affected by the proposed protective duties.\r\n\r\nHow  then  can Singapore promote her industries?  If\r\n\r\r\nindustries  can  be  set  up,  they  will  be   only\r\n\r\nindustries  that play a secondary role to Federation\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that such terms of the uncommon\r\n\r\nCommon  Market  which the P.A.P. has  obtained  for\r\n\r\nSingapore are not going to help our people  at  all.\r\n\r\nQuite   to  the  contrary,  all  the  benefits   and\r\n\r\nadvantages  are going to be on the Federation  side.\r\n\r\nSingapore will receive only the crumbs. The whole of\r\n\r\nthe  financial control is in Federation hands.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  issue of pioneer certificates will have  to  be\r\n\r\napproved by the Federation Government. This is found\r\n\r\nin the Annex to Annex J. In the event that Singapore\r\n\r\nwishes  to  establish an industry that  can  compete\r\n\r\nwith  a similar existing industry in the Federation,\r\n\r\nthen the pioneer certificates issued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Singapore Government will not be  approved.\r\n\r\nEven if the industry is not yet established but  the\r\n\r\nFederation  wishes to establish such an industry,  a\r\n\r\npioneer   certificate  issued   by   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment will also not be approved. How then do we\r\n\r\nhope to promote industrialisation in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Annex to Annex J, the Federation Government\r\n\r\nhas  powers to fix the rate of tax on the  value  of\r\n\r\ngoods for duty or for excise purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government has powers also to make\r\n\r\nall  regulations in relation to Customs and  Excise.\r\n\r\nThe  Federation  Government,  in  fact,  has  direct\r\n\r\naccess  to all documents and records of the  Customs\r\n\r\nand  Excise Department, and can issue directions  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government to ensure collection  and\r\n\r\nprotection of Federation Customs duties and  Excise.\r\n\r\nThus,  Singapore is merely to be the  collector  and\r\n\r\noffice  boy of the Federation. So what is  all  this\r\n\r\ntalk  about  Common  Market  giving  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  benefits? What we have  is  only  a  very\r\n\r\ndoubtful    advantage.   On   the   contrary,    the\r\n\r\ndisadvantages are certain and plain to see. We  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  told  the  P.A.P. that  without   equal\r\n\r\npolitical  rights  the interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   cannot  be  adequately   protected   and\r\n\r\nsafeguarded. This bears out what we have  repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid, both inside and outside the House. So much for\r\n\r\nthe   Common  Market  which  is  going  to   deprive\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  the  free port status  and  does  not\r\n\r\nsafeguard or protect her industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now briefly summarise the results of the\r\n\r\nfinancial merger talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. What was supposed to have been a lump payment\r\n\r\nfor  Federal services in Singapore in 1961  has  now\r\n\r\nbecome   a   percentage  payment  for  Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\nservices in 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What was calculated by the P.A.P. Government as\r\n\r\npayment  to  the  Federation  at  34  per  cent   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  national  revenue  has  now  become   a\r\n\r\npayment of 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What was originally a lump sum payment of only\r\n\r\n$78  million  per  year  now  becomes  a  percentage\r\n\r\npayment  amounting to $124 million  which  increases\r\n\r\nyear by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The P.A.P. says that Singapore cannot afford to\r\n\r\ngive  a grant of S50 million, but finally the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  gives  away a loan of $150 million,  - $100\r\n\r\nmillion  of which is interest free. The $150 million\r\n\r\nloan  is  worth more than the $50 million  grant  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) From the bold stand of \"must collect and keep\r\n\r\nand  pay\", the Prime Minister now is willing  to  be\r\n\r\nonly  the  office  boy  or  rent-collector  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. said categorically that the free\r\n\r\nport  status after merger would remain. Now the free\r\n\r\nport  status  will  remain and be confined  only  to\r\n\r\nBlakang Mati after 12 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) With the free port status reduced to the size\r\n\r\nof  Blakang  Mati, the free port trade in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  suffer  with  the  grave  danger  of  loss  of\r\n\r\nemployment, and increased cost of living  for  large\r\n\r\nsections of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Common Market terms are weighted entirely\r\n\r\non  the side of the Federation and will not promote,\r\n\r\nsafe-guard and protect Singapore industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The harmonisation of taxes will mean a rise in\r\n\r\nprice of consumer goods with a corresponding rise in\r\n\r\nthe cost of living for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me come to the question of land and the 50\r\n\r\nper cent labour that the P.A.P. Government brags  so\r\n\r\nmuch about, and let us see what they really mean. In\r\n\r\naddition to the payment to the Federation of 40  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the national revenue of Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\nloan  of  $150  million ($100 million  of  which  is\r\n\r\ninterest  free), the Singapore Government  has  also\r\n\r\nagreed  to  pay  for  the  (lay-to-day  running  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of departments like Broadcasting,  T.V.,\r\n\r\nand others.

The reply reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n `Dear Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In  the  event of the Government of the Federation\r\n\r\nintroducing legislation under Article 9 (3)  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of Malaysia imposing restrictions  as\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the States of Malaya  on  the\r\n\r\nright conferred by Article 9 (2), I agree that such\r\n\r\nrestrictions should be reciprocal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Yours Sincerely.\r\n\r\n                        (Signed)'.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I do not want to waste the time of the House by\r\n\r\nreading  to you what are firstly, secondly, thirdly,\r\n\r\nand  so on. Anybody can buy this Paper and read  the\r\n\r\neight  points  listed  by  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  only answer was a  six-line  letter\r\n\r\nwhich,  in fact, says yes to (1), no to (2),  no  to\r\n\r\n(3),  (4)   no, (5)  no, (6)  no, (7)  no, (8)   no,  and\r\n\r\nlastly  no. This is a real slap in the face  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  a  real  slap  in the  face  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore. There is not even any mention\r\n\r\nof  the other seven points. This only means that the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime  Minister has not  agreed  to  the\r\n\r\nother  points  raised  by  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the last minute. The Federation  does\r\n\r\nnot give in so easily as the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister tries to play up on the 1,300 acres of land that he is supposed to have got back from the War Department of the U.K. Government. He wanted to create a picture of himself as a great anti-colonialist, a real anti-colonial hero. He said that he could have made Duncan Sandys kneel on his bended knees. That is what he said, \"to get Duncan\r\n\r\nSandys  to kneel on his bended knees\". He  does  not\r\n\r\nrealise - foolish man - that he was being made use  of\r\n\r\nby  the  British  all  the  time.  But,  of  course,\r\n\r\neverybody  knows  that the laugh is  on  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstooge. May I refer you,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the letter of 8th July, 1963, from Duncan\r\n\r\nSandys  of the Colonial Office to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  Singapore?  I will summarise the letter.  Duncan\r\n\r\nSandys  clarified  the  situation  as  follows:  (1) \r\n\r\nBlakang Mati will not be released until August 1966,\r\n\r\ni.e. three years from now; not immediately but 1966,\r\n\r\nand by that time I do not know what will happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

This is Blakang Mati!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

Is it Paper Misc. 5?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is too long a letter for me\r\n\r\nto  read. It is Paper Misc. 5 of 1963. The pages are\r\n\r\nnot  numbered, but starting from the cover it  would\r\n\r\nbe page 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> There are two letters dated\r\n\r\n8th  July.  The  Member is referring to  the  second\r\n\r\nletter of that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, that is corect. I have\r\n\r\nalready  summarised that letter. It  says  that  (1) \r\n\r\nBlakang Mati will not be released until 1966,  which\r\n\r\nis  three years from now. And (2)  land in the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase  too  will not be released. The U.K. Government\r\n\r\nwould  only  have no objection to the  wish  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister that the Crown land now occupied  by\r\n\r\nthe  British  Military Forces in  Malaya  under  the\r\n\r\nDefence Agreement be covered by a 30-year lease at a\r\n\r\nnominal rent of $1 per site. $1 per site, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, and on a 30-year lease. From this alone  we\r\n\r\ncan see that the Prime Minister of Singapore has got\r\n\r\nreally  nothing  very much in this land  deal.  Long\r\n\r\nbefore  the 30 years are out, the Naval Base  should\r\n\r\nhave been liquidated and the land handed back to the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore and Malaya. Similarly,  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati, which Singapore hopes to use as a free\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nzone  in  the  Common Market arrangements,  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased only after 1966, a long time from now. What\r\n\r\nhappens to the Common Market before then? From  now,\r\n\r\nthat  is, from the 1st of September. 1963, to  1966,\r\n\r\nwhere  is  the  \"Free Zone\" going to be?  In  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nland? Then what of the other lands that Singapore is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have got back from the United  Kingdom?\r\n\r\nThe  letter of 8th July from Duncan Sandys tells  us\r\n\r\nthat the land in Fort Canning will be handed over to\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Singapore if and when the British\r\n\r\nService authorities no longer need the area. \"If and\r\n\r\nwhen\"  - and  that  too  only on  condition  that  an\r\n\r\nalternative  site is provided for outside  the  City\r\n\r\narea plus compensation at current value paid for the\r\n\r\nbuildings  therein. Where then are the 1,300  acres?\r\n\r\nThe   lands  that  can  be  made  available  without\r\n\r\ncondition to the Singapore Government are  sites  in\r\n\r\nChangi  and Pulau Brani. The total area is only  176\r\n\r\nacres.  The  large  areas  in  Sembawang  and  Pulau\r\n\r\nBlakang  Mati will be made available only  on  fixed\r\n\r\nconditions. Is this claim of the return of land  not\r\n\r\na sham?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can refer, Sir, to the annex of the letter\r\n\r\nfrom   Duncan  Sandys  to  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is all stated very clearly  here.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  is  the  P.A.P. trying to bluff the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. claims that it has obtained from the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Government $10 million as payment for  illegal\r\n\r\noccupation  of Singapore land. But let us  be  clear\r\n\r\nwhat  the  money has been given for. It is  not  for\r\n\r\nrent  or compensation for the land occupied  by  the\r\n\r\nmilitary forces. Any rent payable is only a  nominal\r\n\r\nrent  of  $1  per site. Mr Deputy Speaker,  $1  per\r\n\r\nsite.  That is very cheap. Of course, as I say,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. can  only be tough and can only  take  tough\r\n\r\naction against people who have no guns, no arms,  to\r\n\r\nfight  back. But when it is a matter of the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  P.A.P. shrink  themselves  into  a\r\n\r\nshell.  They dare not fight. They talk tough to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   Why   not  talk  tough  to   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Instead  they  kneel  down  before  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government. But they want to tell the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore that they got Duncan Sandys on bended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknees.
