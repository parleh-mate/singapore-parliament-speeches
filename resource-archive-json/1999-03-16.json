He had said that Government was out to exterminate, kill,\r\n\r\nwipe out, Chinese culture, language and education and asked  for\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  people to stand up.

I will not go into the details of this report  which\r\n\r\nhave been variously carried in the press.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most impressive statements that I heard during\r\n\r\nall those hours of discussions and dialogues came from a freight\r\n\r\nforwarder.   After  all the feedback and complaints,  as  usual,\r\n\r\nduring  a 3-hour session, he stood up and confessed that in  all\r\n\r\nhis  more than 30 years of the freighting business in Singapore,\r\n\r\nonly  today,  in spite of so many vehicles on the road,  can  he\r\n\r\nreally be confident to plan and execute a freight operation from\r\n\r\none end of Singapore to the port, to time it such that there  is\r\n\r\na  minimum of delay and time loss, and in the shortest  possible\r\n\r\ntime,  in  order  for  his goods to go up the  container  vessel\r\n\r\nberthed at the port just in time.  He does this every day in his\r\n\r\nbusiness.   He  attributed this to the VQS and the  Government's\r\n\r\nforward  looking  systematic  policies  on  land  transport   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  the  power of  technology  and  system  and\r\n\r\npolitical  will.  This was the greatest compliment I  heard  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and his Ministry.  Unfortunately, the Minister was\r\n\r\nnot there, and it is not in the report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report made several recommendations which I will just\r\n\r\nhighlight in order to give other Members the chance to have a go\r\n\r\nat  it.  We recommended to retain the system, although  we  went\r\n\r\ninto  it  with  an  open mind.  We found large support  for  the\r\n\r\nretention of the system with the lowest successful bid  approach\r\n\r\nas against the pay-as-you-bid approach.  We recommended that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider raising the cap of 3% in view of  the\r\n\r\nERP system which can address usage costs more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommended the merging of Categories 1 and 2, and\r\n\r\n3  and 4 into two classes, the line being drawn at the 1,600 cc.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we believe there should be one category of cars.  We do\r\n\r\nnot  recommend loading the already complicated COE  system  with\r\n\r\nall kinds of social equity reasons and factors, so that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalue,  benefit and costs are transparent and clear to all.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we cannot completely dismantle the present system,  but\r\n\r\nthe Minister should be clear of our direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving a bigger category size, ie, a larger number of\r\n\r\nCOE  quota  with  the  merged  category,  we  should  find  more\r\n\r\ncompetition,  choice and a more stable outcome.   In  fact,  too\r\n\r\nsmall  a  category  size  leads to  a  high  possibility  of  an\r\n\r\nanomalous  outcome.   Merging the categories  also  gives  wider\r\n\r\nchoice  of cars, and a more competitive environment for business\r\n\r\nbenefiting the larger number of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommended to even out the surge in COE in the\r\n\r\nyear  2000 by distributing it over two years, namely,  2000  and\r\n\r\n2001.  For everyone who owns or successfully bids for a COE, the\r\n\r\nGovernment must also be able to justify to the larger population\r\n\r\nwho   use  public  transport  and  pay  taxes,  that  the   road\r\n\r\ninfrastructures  are  put to good use and  social  benefits  and\r\n\r\ncosts  must also be weighed against private benefits and  costs.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must be fair overall and not just please or  bow\r\n\r\nto  one section of car dealers or population who may have  their\r\n\r\nown preferences or legitimate interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are for a more dynamic mechanism with a revised formula\r\n\r\nthat  collapses  the time lag and allocates the distribution  to\r\n\r\nreflect  changing preferences of the car buying public,  instead\r\n\r\nof  being  locked  into  a distribution function  of  COEs  that\r\n\r\nreflect preferences 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also made a recommendation for a trial out of an open-bid system in the open category. I will go into this a while.\r\n\r\nAfter  all  these recommendations, we ended with a  prayer.   We\r\n\r\nhope  the  dealers  will  provide a more transparent  and  arm's\r\n\r\nlength,  above-the-table engagement with  customers,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  who  bid  on  their  own.  We  do  not  believe  all  the\r\n\r\nunfavourable  comments  we  have received  on  the  dealers  are\r\n\r\njustified,  and  we do not agree to the call to  ban  them  from\r\n\r\nbidding.  We believe they perform a service in the economy.  The\r\n\r\nsolution is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  the  system more transparent and even out the  information\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies arising from knowledge of market and experience in\r\n\r\nbidding  or collusive power.  Ten years ago, the technology  and\r\n\r\nprocesses did not allow such a wide area open bid to be possible\r\n\r\nbut  today  with  information technology  and  computing  power,\r\n\r\nelectronic bidding goes on all over the world, every  minute  of\r\n\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways in which an auction can be conducted.\r\n\r\nIt  puzzles  me  how  before  the model  is  even  specified  or\r\n\r\ndeveloped, a writer to the Straits Times yesterday can  talk  of\r\n\r\nthe flaws of an open-bid system.  Caricatures of it appeared  in\r\n\r\nthe  press, like frenzied bidding for some rare art piece or the\r\n\r\nseventh moon or-kim.  However, it will not be the first time  an\r\n\r\nelectronic real time open bid auction is done in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\npig  auction in Singapore is done electronically on a real  time\r\n\r\nopen  bid  basis daily.  It has been done so for  more  than  10\r\n\r\nyears.   Do we find the prices of pork unduly higher because  of\r\n\r\nsome  cornering  of  pork  for market  share  or  some  frenzied\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  pork  over  the  last  10  years?   The  person\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  developing this open bid real time  electronic\r\n\r\nauction  system for pigs more than 10 years ago is sitting  very\r\n\r\ncomfortably in the front bench as Minister and Government  Whip.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the  technology was different but  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nconcept is the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, rules apply for such bid processes. Hence, I am\r\n\r\nconfident  the  study  will come out with  a  model,  which  can\r\n\r\novercome the many fears expressed.  I wish to thank all for  the\r\n\r\nfeedback.   No  one can give you the outcome of a  bid  process,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is going to be high or low.  If he can, it has  been\r\n\r\nfixed.   The COE allocation or bidding mechanism can  only  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  supply side.  We should make it more  stable  and\r\n\r\npredictable, more transparent.  The demand side depends  on  the\r\n\r\nbuyers.   It depends on rationality, information power,  income,\r\n\r\neconomic  outlook,  expectations  and  the  value  perceived  by\r\n\r\nbuyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open-bid system gives a more transparent model with\r\n\r\ninformation to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  buyers.  The mandate to bid can also be given to  a  dealer\r\n\r\nbut the mandate is transparent between the buyer and the dealer.\r\n\r\nThis  way the buyer knows exactly what the dealer is bidding  on\r\n\r\nhis  behalf or whether it is within the mandate.  Alternatively,\r\n\r\nthe  buyer  bids  on  his  own.  In  a  close  bid  system,  the\r\n\r\ninformation is not revealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many kinds of auction systems that are practised\r\n\r\nby businesses all over the world.  For example, there is the one-sided auction, the two-sided auction, the Dutch auction and  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  auction.   However, unfortunately,  what  we  are  more\r\n\r\nfamiliar here is only the seventh moon auction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open bid model we are advocating that fits our system\r\n\r\nis  the  one-sided open competitive bid auction, with the lowest\r\n\r\nsuccessful  bid.  It can be coupled with a Dutch  auction  where\r\n\r\nyou bid down, or an English auction method where you bid up.   I\r\n\r\nsuggest  we  leave  the  details and the process  to  the  study\r\n\r\ncommittee,  which will come out with the proper model  that  can\r\n\r\naddress the real nitty-gritty issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of experimental economics is full of such case\r\n\r\nstudies.  There is a wealth of literature to draw on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world today, consumers want to have the\r\n\r\ninformation and the power to choose and decide.  Companies  with\r\n\r\nhundreds  of billions of dollars of sales are studying ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans towards a more efficient consumer response  using IT, with\r\n\r\nmore  rational  processes.  They are all re-evaluating  and  re-constructing   their  supply  chain  using  IT   for   efficient\r\n\r\nprocesses.  All over the world, electronic bids are done on  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  for  example, E-bay dot.com.  Business  process  will\r\n\r\nhave  to change to a more efficient way of doing things for  the\r\n\r\nopen world.  The same goes for the bidding system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans deserve and should be given the information\r\n\r\nand the responsibility for their decision and action.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsumers  will have an important say in this and will determine\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  of  the bid which will reflect the  social  market\r\n\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Mr Chay. Dr Toh.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I sat on the VQS Review\r\n\r\nCommittee   as   a   member  of  the  GPC  for   Communications.\r\n\r\nUnavoidable,  of  course,  I brought  in  my  experiences  as  a\r\n\r\nconsumer   advocate,  being  the  President  of  the  Consumers'\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VQS is not a consumer issue directly. It is a\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  allocate scarce resources.   It  is  a  mechanism\r\n\r\nwhereby  the Government decides that the growth of vehicles  has\r\n\r\ngot  to be controlled, and this control mechanism means that the\r\n\r\nquota  is fixed as to who will get cars from this quota.  It  is\r\n\r\nwhat the VQS is all about.  In the process of buying a car which\r\n\r\nis,  of course, a consumer issue, the consumer wants to be  able\r\n\r\nto  buy  with a free choice.  In other words, in an ideal system\r\n\r\nhe should be able to get a COE and then go round to shop for his\r\n\r\ncar.   And  if he leaves the COE with the dealer that  does  not\r\n\r\nsatisfy  his needs after maybe one, two bids, and one  month  or\r\n\r\ntwo  months,  he  can  take  back the  COE  and  go  to  another\r\n\r\norganisation that deals with a different car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that the consumer faces is that at this moment,\r\n\r\nhe  feels  that the system is stacked too much against him,  and\r\n\r\ntoo  much for the dealer.  For example, COE, even though it  can\r\n\r\nbe  bidded in the name of an individual, IC number is given, but\r\n\r\nthe c/o address is always the dealer's address.  So the COE goes\r\n\r\nto  the  dealer  and stays with him.  And that  means  that  the\r\n\r\ndealer  has got quite a few COEs in his command.  He can command\r\n\r\nand  manipulate prices, and he can hold on to the COE, and  tell\r\n\r\nthe consumer, \"Look, you go to another dealer, you are not going\r\n\r\nto get another car, because I have the COE.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another situation is where the consumer says, \"I will get\r\n\r\nthe  COE myself.\"  And he brings this COE to the dealer, and the\r\n\r\ndealer says, \"Hey, you got your own COE, I am not going to  sell\r\n\r\nyou a car.\"  Or he says, \"Yes, I will sell you the car, but I am\r\n\r\nnot  giving  you my special offer prices.\"  And this would  mean\r\n\r\nthat ultimately the consumer says, \"I have no choice.\"  You  say\r\n\r\nI  have a choice, but it is a Hobson's choice, it is not a  real\r\n\r\nchoice.   So it would be good.  And I think, having sat  on  the\r\n\r\nVQS  Committee,  argued all these points, I  have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that actually, as many consumers do realise, the  VQS\r\n\r\nis  a good system and it should be kept.  But I think we need to\r\n\r\naddress  some  of these issues so that ultimately the  consumer,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  knows that he really has a choice.  I  personally\r\n\r\nfeel, of course, that if you ban dealers from bidding, it is not\r\n\r\nan  answer.  Because then we will create actually a new class of\r\n\r\nprofessionals called car brokers, car dealers, COE brokers,  who\r\n\r\nwill  then  do  what the dealers are doing.  Because  ultimately\r\n\r\nsome  consumers  do  not have the time,  they  do  want  to  pay\r\n\r\nsomebody to do it for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government when it considers the\r\n\r\nreview of the open bidding system that we build in some measures\r\n\r\nto  make sure that frenzied bidding, cornering of the market and\r\n\r\nthis  whole idea that consumers cannot bid because they have  no\r\n\r\ninformation.  all  these  will  be  taken  care  of,   so   that\r\n\r\nultimately, even if there is a bid, the consumers know  that  it\r\n\r\nis a fair and level playing field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for suggestions like scaling and pay-as-you-bid system,\r\n\r\nI  would ask the Government to even consider if these things can\r\n\r\nbe worked into the open bidding system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, there has\r\n\r\nunderstandably  been  much  concern and  anticipation  over  the\r\n\r\nproposed  changes to the COE and the Vehicle Quota  System.   In\r\n\r\ngeneral, I am supportive of the recommendations made by the  GPC\r\n\r\nCommittee on revising the Vehicle Quota System.  However, I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmy reservations regarding the proposed open bidding system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Vehicle Quota System is not perfect. We all\r\n\r\nknow that.  However, there are merits to the system, and it  has\r\n\r\nserved  our  purposes very well all these  years.   The  present\r\n\r\nsystem  of limiting vehicle growth through a quota system should\r\n\r\nstay.   However,  refinement or fine-tuning  may  be  necessary.\r\n\r\nChanges  towards  more  transparency,  as  recommended  by   the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  whilst beneficial may impact greatly  upon  existing\r\n\r\nusers   and   consumers.   Hence,  I  believe  the   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  progressive change by trying  out  the  open\r\n\r\nbidding system with only one category of vehicles at the  moment\r\n\r\nis  useful, as it allows consumers and participants in  the  car\r\n\r\nmarket  to  adjust  progressively towards a new  system,  if  it\r\n\r\nworks.   This  also allows for refinement to the  system  should\r\n\r\nopen  bidding  for  the open category be subject  to  abuse  and\r\n\r\nmanipulation later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the principles of transparency and gradual\r\n\r\nchange,  I  am  pleased  to  note that  the  Committee  is  also\r\n\r\nrecommending  collapsing the two categories down  to  two  broad\r\n\r\nones.   This  is  sensible in my mind, as congestion  costs  for\r\n\r\nvehicles  are  not directly correlated with the size  of  engine\r\n\r\ncapacities for cars.  There had been occasions in the past where\r\n\r\ndue  to  affordability of the smaller capacity  vehicle  owners,\r\n\r\nCOEs  for  these smaller categories were higher than  those  for\r\n\r\nlarger categories.  Consumers who have no choice but to purchase\r\n\r\nless  powerful cars unfortunately end up paying more  for  their\r\n\r\nCOEs,  compared to consumers who are able to afford  the  larger\r\n\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the proposal to streamline the categories into\r\n\r\ntwo  will  in part address this anomaly and flatten  the  spread\r\n\r\nacross the categories, not to mention the freak result of a  $50\r\n\r\nCOE.  However, I would like to raise a matter of serious concern\r\n\r\n-   the   underlying  assumptions  of  open  bidding.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nconsumers  are rational.  We assume that they can make  informed\r\n\r\ndecisions that best reflect their self-interest.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\ntransparency of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  system in itself would cancel out possible abuses since the\r\n\r\nfree market competition will set the price.  Sir, the failure of\r\n\r\nany or both of these conditions may disadvantage the majority of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  car owners.  It is inevitable that there  would  be\r\n\r\nasymmetry  in  information accessed by both the laymen  and  the\r\n\r\nspecialists  in the motor trade.  If buyers are allowed  to  bid\r\n\r\nand  withdraw  at  will, which may happen  in  an  open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem,  there  could  be manipulation of  prices  by  concerted\r\n\r\nparties who may have an interest in maintaining vehicle price at\r\n\r\na particular level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, the kiasu mentality of Singaporeans could\r\n\r\nresult  in  extensive  tendering, leading  to  misallocation  of\r\n\r\nresources.  Since, in order to ensure that one gets the COE,  it\r\n\r\nis  more  likely  that competitive bidding may  lead  to  higher\r\n\r\nprices,  which  may not necessarily reflect an efficient  market\r\n\r\npricing  for  this reason, as well as the potential manipulation\r\n\r\nof  prices  by interested parties.  This is a matter of  serious\r\n\r\nconcern  to many Singaporeans who have voiced objection  to  the\r\n\r\nopen  bidding system, considering the difficult economic  period\r\n\r\nthat we are all going through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I would strongly recommend that along with\r\n\r\ngreater transparency and open bidding, we also try out the  pay-as-you-bid system.  This would ensure responsible bidding and it\r\n\r\nwould  not  result  in artificially raising  the  average  price\r\n\r\nthrough the possible anomalies highlighted above, benefiting all\r\n\r\nusers and consumers in the long run.  With a combination of open\r\n\r\nbidding  and  pay-as-you-bid system, it  is  unlikely  that  the\r\n\r\n\"winner's  curse\"  situation, as argued by the Committee,  would\r\n\r\nresult,  as consumers would be making bids responsibly based  on\r\n\r\nup-to-date information, and can best reflect their own  interest\r\n\r\nand demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither system is without its merits and flaws. I\r\n\r\nwould like to strongly recommend to the Minister that we use the\r\n\r\nproposed  refinements of the categories to test the  pay-as-you-bid system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich has a lot of support from the public.  For a start, we can\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the status quo arrangement for the 1,600  cc  and\r\n\r\nbelow   category.    We  can  also  take  up   the   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  open bidding to be experimented  with  the\r\n\r\nOpen  Category.  My proposal is that we use the same  period  in\r\n\r\nassessing the open bidding system for the Open Category to  test\r\n\r\nthe  pay-as-you-bid system for the 1,600 cc and above  category.\r\n\r\nThis  will ensure that we can have a gradual approach to  change\r\n\r\nwhile  evaluating all three systems together, in order  to  best\r\n\r\ndecide once and for all which is the best system for us.  Let us\r\n\r\ntry  out  the  three  systems  simultaneously  among  the  three\r\n\r\ncategories  of vehicles and review them, perhaps,  in  a  year's\r\n\r\ntime, to decide which is an ideal system for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take up these suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I was one of the\r\n\r\nmembers  in  this  Committee.  I rise  to  lend  support  to  my\r\n\r\nChairman.   And  I  would like the House to  know  that  we  did\r\n\r\ndeliberate  very seriously on this matter.  We invited  so  many\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people to come, representing people of  many  varied\r\n\r\ninterests, including the individual car owners.  So I would  say\r\n\r\nthat we did a very thorough study on this matter.  And I thought\r\n\r\nthat  at  this juncture, after having heard Mr Chew  Heng  Ching\r\n\r\nmentioning  the  pay-as-you-bid system, maybe I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nstate  our Committee's reasons why we did not accept the pay-as-you-bid proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee actually received several suggestions to\r\n\r\nreplace the current single strike price system, with the pay-as-you-bid system, or its variations such as asking the top 10%  or\r\n\r\n20%  successful bidders to pay their bid amounts.  We have given\r\n\r\nthese suggestions due consideration in the course of our review.\r\n\r\nThe  Committee is of the view that the pay-as-you-bid system  is\r\n\r\nnot   superior  to  the  current  system.   It   has   its   own\r\n\r\nshortcomings.   But  some  of  the  feedback  received  by   the\r\n\r\nCommittee had expressed the following concerns about the pay-as-you-bid  system.   There  could  be  an  additional  source   of\r\n\r\ndiscontent among the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuccessful  bidders as no one likes the idea of  having  to  pay\r\n\r\nmore  for  the  same  item.  Only the  ones  paying  the  lowest\r\n\r\npremiums would be happy.  Some laymen might have difficulties in\r\n\r\ndeciding on the right price to bid, for fear that they might  be\r\n\r\npenalised  for  bidding too high.  This could  lead  to  greater\r\n\r\nreliance on motor vehicle dealers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pay-as-you-bid system will cause confusion in the motor\r\n\r\nvehicle  trade and vehicle financing industry.  Some  economists\r\n\r\nand  academics  have expressed the view that the  pay-as-you-bid\r\n\r\nsystem could establish a stronger incentive for collusion  among\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicle  dealers to ensure that they  bid  close  to  the\r\n\r\nlowest  successful price.  The Committee also felt that  it  was\r\n\r\nnot  fair  to  always  penalise the  top  10%  or  20%  bidders,\r\n\r\nespecially  if their bids are close to the lowest strike  price.\r\n\r\nBased  on the statistics of past tender exercises, the Committee\r\n\r\nnoted the trend that bids were converging towards the low as you\r\n\r\nbid.  Generally, the successful bids clustered around the 20% to\r\n\r\n30% above the lowest strike price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the above into consideration, the Committee decided\r\n\r\nthat  the  current  method  based on the  price  of  the  lowest\r\n\r\nsuccessful bid should be retained.  I may not have given him the\r\n\r\nbest  answer he wants, but maybe later on in the course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  we  could discuss further.  But I do hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  really take into consideration all the proposals  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  made,  and  perhaps give them a try, especially  the  open\r\n\r\nbidding system for the open category.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I read with great\r\n\r\ninterest the Report of the Vehicle Quota System Review Committee\r\n\r\nand can appreciate the difficulties faced by the Committee as it\r\n\r\ntried to grapple with and balance the various conflicting issues\r\n\r\nabout  social equity, car categories, quota size and the  myriad\r\n\r\nof  factors  that  make  the subject  of  vehicle  ownership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore such a talked-about and emotive one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicle Quota System was introduced 10 years ago. For\r\n\r\nall  its flaws and inadequacies, I believe the system is working\r\n\r\nreasonably well.  Prices of COE have stabilised at a level  that\r\n\r\nis appropriate in the light of the present state of our economy.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  that  buyers are rational and  notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\ninitial  fears,  prices of COEs had not shot  through  the  roof\r\n\r\nexcept  for  a  brief period in the midst of a booming  economy,\r\n\r\nrife  speculation  and  material excesses.   Over  the  last  12\r\n\r\nmonths, prices have been moving within a band of between $20,000\r\n\r\nand  $40,000.  There was resistance when prices hit the high 30s\r\n\r\nand  when  prices came down to the low 20s, buyers  entered  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicle Quota System is maturing. We should give it\r\n\r\nsome more time and let it stabilise further.  At this stage,  we\r\n\r\nshould not make drastic changes merely for the change alone.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, we should not introduce any more uncertainties\r\n\r\ninto the system.  Uncertainties leading to wide fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nprices  are detrimental to dealers, owners, aspiring car  buyers\r\n\r\nand  the financial institutions which finance them.  It can also\r\n\r\nbe  a  source  of  discontent.  How many of us have  experienced\r\n\r\nsituations where after we have bought an item, the price of that\r\n\r\nitem  dropped  the very next month because of  some  changes  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy.   A recent example is the  prevailing  quota\r\n\r\npremium  which fell significantly as a result of the  change  in\r\n\r\ncomputation  from a 12-month to a 3-month moving  average.   The\r\n\r\nconverse  is when we have not bought the item yet and the  price\r\n\r\nshoots up because of a change in policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on three of the Committee's\r\n\r\nobservations which I have reservations about.  They are (1)  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of COEs among the different categories, (2)  merger\r\n\r\nof Categories 1 and 2, and (3) the proposed open tender system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first issue, in principle, I agree that\r\n\r\nvehicle  quota should be distributed in such a way as to  better\r\n\r\nreflect  the latest preference of motorists.  There  must  be  a\r\n\r\nbuilt-in mechanism to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlet  the system respond in a timely manner to market trends  and\r\n\r\nconsumer  demand.  If the system is rigid and  based  on  quotas\r\n\r\nfixed  by  the  authorities  from a top-down  approach,  drastic\r\n\r\ncorrective action will have to be taken from time to time,  like\r\n\r\nthe  one-time adjustment made in May 1994 when unused motorcycle\r\n\r\nCOEs   were   redistributed  to  other  categories.    This   is\r\n\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not agree with the Committee's suggestion for\r\n\r\ntwo half-yearly quotas and the distribution among the categories\r\n\r\nto  be  based  on the proportion of vehicles registered  in  the\r\n\r\nrespective  categories in the preceding six-month  period.   How\r\n\r\ncan  the  quota in any category change substantially  over  time\r\n\r\nwhen the number of new cars registered in that category has been\r\n\r\nfixed  in  the first place by the quota?  For example,  even  if\r\n\r\nthere  is the demand for 5,000 Category 1 cars, but if the quota\r\n\r\nis only 2,000, then only 2,000 Category 1 cars can be registered\r\n\r\nsubject  only to those registered using Open Category  COEs  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  those  COEs from higher categories if  this  option  is\r\n\r\nallowed in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government should study the feasibility of\r\n\r\nallowing COEs from any category to be used to register  cars  in\r\n\r\nanother  category subject to payment of the appropriate transfer\r\n\r\nfees  and  an  additional levy.  The additional levy  should  be\r\n\r\nequal to the positive difference between the quota premium  paid\r\n\r\nfor the COE and the corresponding quota premium for the category\r\n\r\nunder which the car is eventually registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, quota categories. While I agree with the Committee\r\n\r\nthat some segmentation of the total COE quota is necessary, I do\r\n\r\nnot   agree  with  its  recommendation  to  merge  the   current\r\n\r\nCategories 1 and 2 together.  Categories 3 and 4 could be merged\r\n\r\ninto  one.  But for social equity reasons, I believe the current\r\n\r\nCategory  1 should be retained.  This category caters  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  would like to buy an inexpensive car or a small car.   This\r\n\r\ngives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe low-income group the opportunity to own a car.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  trend towards smaller cars especially for  getting\r\n\r\nfrom place to place in an urban environment like Singapore.   To\r\n\r\ngroup them into one category would mean that a buyer of a 800 cc\r\n\r\nsub-compact  has  to  compete and bid in the  same  category  as\r\n\r\nbuyers  of  four-door saloons.  I think the gap  is  simply  too\r\n\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Option 3 as presented in the Committee's Report,\r\n\r\nwhere  there would be three categories comprising lower,  middle\r\n\r\nand  upper,  would  result in a more equitable  distribution  of\r\n\r\nCOEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the quota size, the undesirable effects of a\r\n\r\nsmall  quota in the lower category can be mitigated by  allowing\r\n\r\nCOEs  from the two bigger car categories to be used to  register\r\n\r\ncars  from the lower category but, if the premium for the  lower\r\n\r\ncategory  is  higher,  then  an additional  levy  equal  to  the\r\n\r\npositive difference between the quota premium paid for  the  COE\r\n\r\nand  the  corresponding  quota premium for  the  lower  category\r\n\r\nshould be paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue of the bidding mechanism, while a pay-as-you-bid system may lead to \"winner's curse\", there is a danger\r\n\r\nthat an open bidding system will lead to the \"don't-want-to-just-miss-it\"  syndrome, where bidders increase their bids by  a  bit\r\n\r\nmore  so as not to miss it.  If bidders are aware of the current\r\n\r\nlower  strike  price,  they will put in a  slightly  higher  bid\r\n\r\nprice, thereby driving up the strike price.  On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nunder  the  present closed system, bidders have shown that  they\r\n\r\nare rational and have placed bids at a level that is appropriate\r\n\r\nunder  prevailing market conditions.  If he is  not  successful,\r\n\r\nthe bidder has one whole month to cool down and rethink his next\r\n\r\nbid  which  may or may not be higher as market conditions  could\r\n\r\nhave changed significantly in the meantime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would say that the man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nis  suspicious that the underlying purpose of the review and any\r\n\r\nconsequential changes to the Vehicle Quota System is to increase\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrevenue  from  COEs.   This  perception,  if  untrue,  must   be\r\n\r\ncorrected.   If the objective of the review is to fine-tune  the\r\n\r\nsystem  to  prevent freak results, like the $50 COE, I  hope  we\r\n\r\nwill only tinker with that aspect and not disturb the rest.  Why\r\n\r\nburn the house down to kill the rat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, let me first start by\r\n\r\ncomplimenting  the  GPC for Communications for  a  thorough  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Report on the Vehicle Quota System.  As one who is\r\n\r\nnot  intimately involved in the process, I would, however,  like\r\n\r\nto  raise  some  questions  regarding the  Committee's  findings\r\n\r\nwhilst  I  agree  with  the spirit and  thrust  of  its  general\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a general question that arises: what is the\r\n\r\nobjective of this review?  What prompted the initiation of  this\r\n\r\nprocess?   The  COE system has been in existence  for  nearly  a\r\n\r\ndecade.  Singaporeans, in general, have grown accustomed to  the\r\n\r\nvagaries  of the COE process and, at the same time, dare  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  they have even grown accustomed to the levels of  the  COE\r\n\r\nprices, although there may be some unusual occurrences from time\r\n\r\nto  time.   So the question is: why a review?  Why now?   And  I\r\n\r\nthink  the more cynical have suggested that it might even be  an\r\n\r\neffort  by  the Government  to conserve revenue sparked  by  the\r\n\r\nfreak $50 COE incident.  I would urge the Minister to vigorously\r\n\r\nand comprehensively rebut such erroneous misconceptions and draw\r\n\r\nattention to the true and meaningful purpose of this review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, perhaps we could understand better the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  this review if the Government was able  to  share\r\n\r\nwith  us how it would gauge the success of any changes that  are\r\n\r\nimplemented.   Would we measure the success of this  new  review\r\n\r\nand  the recommendations by a lower variation in COE prices from\r\n\r\nmonth  to  month?   Would we regard it  as  a  success  if  more\r\n\r\nindividuals   participate  directly  in  the   bidding   process\r\n\r\nbypassing middlemen?  Certainly, for Singaporeans in general, it\r\n\r\nwould be a success if COE prices were lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the recommendation on combining COE\r\n\r\ncategories  raises a question which my colleague,  Mr  Ong  Kian\r\n\r\nMin,  has also raised.  What is the impact likely to be  on  the\r\n\r\nbuyers of smaller cars at the lower end of the spectrum that  is\r\n\r\nmerged?   Intuitively, it would suggest that the clearing  price\r\n\r\nwould  be  raised.  There would be a drag effect  upwards  given\r\n\r\nthat  people  tend  to bid for COE prices  in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of  their  car  price.  That  being  the  case,  the\r\n\r\nintuitive  conclusion one comes to is that  this  would  have  a\r\n\r\ndetrimental effect on those who buy smaller cars.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  hear from the Minister and the Ministry on evidence  to  the\r\n\r\ncontrary  in order to reassure buyers of smaller cars that  this\r\n\r\nis not indeed the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the open bidding system, I have great sympathy for\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation  of  the  Committee.   To  me,  trained   in\r\n\r\neconomics,  I  think any system that introduces a process  where\r\n\r\nmore  information can be captured  before a price  is  submitted\r\n\r\nshould  work to the advantage of all.  However, given  the  vast\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the process and the sensitivities of many  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved,  I  fully endorse the recommendation of the  Committee\r\n\r\nthat   this  be  tried  out  in  a  small  measure  first,   its\r\n\r\neffectiveness evaluated thoroughly before the system is extended\r\n\r\nto all categories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a question on the general issue of car\r\n\r\npopulation.   A  fundamental premise underlying our  entire  COE\r\n\r\nsystem is that our vehicle population will be increasing  on  an\r\n\r\nannual rate of about 3%.  Given our finite space for roads and a\r\n\r\nlimited  capacity to increase the road space in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nquestion is: can this 3% be sustained in the long term  and,  if\r\n\r\nnot,  what  plans  are there from the Ministry  to  adjust  this\r\n\r\npercentage?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, the Vehicle Quota System\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  has  completed  its  deliberations  and   has\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its  Report to the Minister.  I am a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee   and   would  urge  the  Minister  to   endorse   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the release of the Review Committee's Report and\r\n\r\nin  fact  even before the release of the Report, there has  been\r\n\r\nnumerous  public debate over the merits and the shortcomings  of\r\n\r\nthe  current  system.  There was no lack of  ideas  of  how  the\r\n\r\ncurrent system can be further refined and improved upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that when the idea of the Vehicle Quota\r\n\r\nSystem  was first mooted, there were outcries from some quarters\r\n\r\nthat  the scheme was ill conceived and it was designed to enrich\r\n\r\nthe  Government's coffer.  Today, after the system has  been  in\r\n\r\nplace  for  a number of years, it has proven to be effective  in\r\n\r\ncontrolling our vehicle population.  Bidding for COE has  become\r\n\r\na way of life for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, when the idea of a revision to the VQS is\r\n\r\nmooted,  we  heard comments like, since the present  system  has\r\n\r\nserved  us  well,  why  change it.  And true  enough,  many  are\r\n\r\napprehensive of the impact of any proposed changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that what the VQS Review Committee has\r\n\r\nproposed  is  a refinement of the current system.   It  has  not\r\n\r\nproposed  a  fundamental change in the vehicle demand management\r\n\r\nstrategy.   It  has  reaffirmed the principle of  allocation  of\r\n\r\nCOEs,  which is to allocate a scarce resource through a  bidding\r\n\r\nprocess.  While there were specific suggestions to fine-tune the\r\n\r\nquota formula and to merge some categories of vehicles under the\r\n\r\nquota  system, what catches the attention of the public  is  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation to review the allowable vehicle growth  rate  and\r\n\r\nto  try  out an open bidding system.  To determine the allowable\r\n\r\nvehicle growth rate, the Government will have to be more precise\r\n\r\nin  its  projection  of the expansion of the road  network,  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  pattern of the population and anticipated  level  of\r\n\r\nroad congestions and other factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that we need a more accurate projection as we should\r\n\r\nnot  go  off  the  mark like the way we project  our  population\r\n\r\ngrowth.  We were told that we have a population of three million\r\n\r\nbut all of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsudden, we were told that we are reaching four million soon.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  which  Ministry is responsible for  this  unplanned  and\r\n\r\nunanticipated fortune or misfortune.  Similarly,  for  the  open\r\n\r\nbidding  system,  the  authority can make  the  system  work  by\r\n\r\nthinking  through  all possible pitfalls and  devise  a  bidding\r\n\r\nmechanism which would minimise abuse and minimise anxiety  among\r\n\r\nthe bidders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people think that the open bidding system is\r\n\r\ninflationary.   It pushes up prices.  The Review  Committee  has\r\n\r\nsuggested that the Government try out an electronic on-line open\r\n\r\nbidding system in the Open Category before extending it  to  the\r\n\r\nentire  VQS.   I  suggest that in trying out  the  open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem,  the Government could introduce a number of measures  to\r\n\r\ncheck  the inflationary tendencies.  For instance, the authority\r\n\r\ncan  limit  the number of times a person can up his bids  during\r\n\r\nthe bidding process.  This will prevent him from raising his bid\r\n\r\nto  outdo others, and this point was raised by Mr Ong Kian  Min.\r\n\r\nAnother  way is to increase the frequency of inviting bids.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  instead  of calling for bids once  a  month,  we  can\r\n\r\nspread  out the quota allocation and call for bids on  a  weekly\r\n\r\nbasis.   So,  those who miss out this week can  bid  again  next\r\n\r\nweek.  There will be no need to panic and rush to secure COEs at\r\n\r\nall costs and this will address the kiasu syndrome expressed  by\r\n\r\nMr Chew Heng Ching earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the authority must lay out clear rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  and devise a fair and workable system.   Only  then\r\n\r\ncan  we assess more objectively the feasibility or otherwise  of\r\n\r\nan open bidding system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not speaking. Dr Wang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, one of the features\r\n\r\nof  the  existing Vehicle Quota System is that  there  are  four\r\n\r\ncategories for cars.  Based on the road space occupied  and  the\r\n\r\ncongestion caused by cars, there is actually not much difference\r\n\r\nbetween  a  car of one size and a car of a different size.   Why\r\n\r\nthen did\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe have a system of four categories?  Perhaps, we should take  a\r\n\r\nmoment  to  think about it.  I believe that a lot  of  political\r\n\r\nwisdom has gone into that particular decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I believe the society as a whole finds it\r\n\r\nsocially  acceptable to isolate the small car  owners  from  the\r\n\r\nstronger purchasing power of the buyers of the bigger cars.   It\r\n\r\nis also socially acceptable for larger cars to pay for its COEs.\r\n\r\nSo, if Ministry of Communications will do a survey, it will find\r\n\r\nthat  almost every Singaporean, including those who have to  pay\r\n\r\nmore, will grudgingly agree that it is a fair system, that it is\r\n\r\nfair  for  big car buyers to pay more.  Fundamentally,  I  think\r\n\r\nwithout  these four categories, perhaps it would have been  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the public to accept the VQS as they did.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  remind the House that many Backbenchers in this  House\r\n\r\nhave  asked,  for  instance,  to create  a  separate  motorcycle\r\n\r\ncategory  and  this is to segregate the big leisure  motorcycles\r\n\r\nlike  Harley  Davidson from the workhorse  individuals  use  for\r\n\r\ntransportation.  Segregation of the weak from being over-run  by\r\n\r\nthe  rich  is  the characteristic of a sense of  social  justice\r\n\r\nimbued  in  the  typical Singaporean.  Therefore,  as  such,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not modify the VQS system without revisiting  this  very\r\n\r\nfundamental rationale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the present VQS system has some weaknesses. It has\r\n\r\nshown up and reflected by the freak result of this $50 COE,  but\r\n\r\nthat  freak  result  was  a convergence  of  many  factors,  the\r\n\r\neconomic   recession  being  one  of  them.   The   VQS   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's  Report  has  pointed out that  the  current  system\r\n\r\nallows  for too large a fluctuation in the yearly COEs  released\r\n\r\nfor ballot.  I can identify one other weakness, and that is, the\r\n\r\nOpen  Category,  which, by and large, favours the  big  cars  or\r\n\r\nluxury  car  buyers.  Why do I say so?  If you look at  how  the\r\n\r\nOpen  Category  COEs were used, I believe the majority  of  them\r\n\r\nwere  used for the registration of big and luxury cars.  So,  in\r\n\r\neffect, the Open Category increases the number of COEs available\r\n\r\nfor  these car categories.  To address some of these problems  I\r\n\r\nhave identified, my preferred proposal would be to merge all the\r\n\r\ncar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncategories  into  one but with one condition,  and  that  is,  a\r\n\r\nstrike price of the COE is meant for the registration of a small\r\n\r\ncar.   To  use  that COE to register a car of a larger  size,  a\r\n\r\nfixed  premium  for the different classes can be pre-determined.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, we could establish a premium of 40% more for  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of medium-size cars, 60% more for a  big  car  and\r\n\r\n100%  more  for a luxury car.  This will address the problem  of\r\n\r\nthe  freak  tender  result that I alluded to  earlier,  and  yet\r\n\r\nretain  the  segregation of different classes of  car  purchases\r\n\r\nthat we have found to be so desirable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC Review Committee proposed two major changes on\r\n\r\nchanging  the open tender system to open bid system and  merging\r\n\r\nthe  four  categories  into  lower  and  upper  categories.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand the GPC actually carried out many sessions with  many\r\n\r\nusers  and  stakeholders in the transportation  industry.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  recommendation does carry some weight.   I  have  no\r\n\r\nmajor  philosophical difficulty with the open bid  system.   The\r\n\r\nmajor  reservation I have is with the merger of  four  different\r\n\r\nclasses  into two and in so doing, giving up the social need  to\r\n\r\nsegregate  the  buyers  of the different  categories,  the  same\r\n\r\nproblem that my colleagues have alluded to earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, the Minister will take my point into\r\n\r\nconsideration.   I  believe  once we give  up  this  fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciple to segregate buyers of different categories  of  cars,\r\n\r\nwe have actually brushed off the political consideration that  I\r\n\r\nhave alluded to earlier.  Once we have accepted this, in future,\r\n\r\nthere is actually no reason why we should have two categories of\r\n\r\nlower  and upper.  In fact, we might very well end up  with  one\r\n\r\naltogether.   I  think it is important for me to reiterate  this\r\n\r\nsocial  equity  factor and sometimes, it  is  this  factor  that\r\n\r\nseparates a successful policy from one that fails.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  10  years since the Vehicle Quota System (VQS)  was  first\r\n\r\nimplemented  in Singapore.  During this period, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications,   through   the   Feedback   Unit,    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and various people,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  collected feedback and suggestions on ways  and  means  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the system, and has actually acted upon some  of  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions to fine-tune our VQS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the present VQS is quite sound and has\r\n\r\neffectively controlled the vehicle growth at an annual  rate  of\r\n\r\n3%.   The tender prices have been stabilised, and our people are\r\n\r\nalready used to the system, and are familiar with the way it  is\r\n\r\noperated.  As  such,  if we want to make  major  changes  again,\r\n\r\npeople will have to start all over again to get used to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are now facing an economic recession, some people\r\n\r\nfeel  that if we adopt an open bidding system for COE, it  would\r\n\r\nturn  out  to be like the bidding at the  Seventh Month Festival\r\n\r\nbidding,  where prices keep going higher and higher.   They  are\r\n\r\nvery  concerned with this possibility.  I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nwill be cautious in studying the recommendation of the Committee\r\n\r\nto change the bidding system so that it would not cause too much\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give my suggestions on the bidding system.\r\n\r\nFirst,   increase the transparency of the tender  system.   Some\r\n\r\nunsuccessful bidders suspect that the Ministry of Communications\r\n\r\nconducted  the  tendering procedure under cover and  manipulated\r\n\r\nthe   bids   to  raise  the  strike  price.   They  claim   that\r\n\r\ntransparency  is  lacking  in our  tender  procedure.   I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the Ministry post all available  information  and\r\n\r\ndata  on  the  Internet for all to see, so as  to  increase  the\r\n\r\ntransparency  of  the  system and give  potential  bidders  more\r\n\r\ninformation to rely on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under the present system, car owners have to\r\n\r\neither  scrap their old cars when they reach 10 years of age, or\r\n\r\nto  renew  the  COE.   Now  that   we  are  facing  an  economic\r\n\r\nrecession, car owners find it difficult either to buy a new  car\r\n\r\nor renew the COE by paying the prevailing premium. It has become\r\n\r\na  great burden to them.   I would suggest  that the present 10-year period for COE be extended to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n12  years  or  even  longer.  This will lighten  the  burden  of\r\n\r\nexisting car owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, many people have suggested the pay-as-you-bid\r\n\r\nsystem  (PAYB)  in  order  to  prevent  the  kiasu  people  from\r\n\r\nsubmitting unreasonably high bids. But the Committee feels  that\r\n\r\nthis  may cause confusion among the finance institutions as  the\r\n\r\nvalues  of  cars will be too diversified.  I think, if possible,\r\n\r\nthe  PAYB  could  be  pegged  to the present  system  of  lowest\r\n\r\nsuccessful bid.  In other words, taking \"you pay as you bid\"  as\r\n\r\nthe  basic  principle, and then tie it up with the principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  lowest  successful bid.  For example, if A bids $22,000,  B\r\n\r\nbids  $50,000 and the strike price is $20,000, then both of them\r\n\r\nwill  pay $20,000 for the COE, and donate the difference between\r\n\r\nthe  bidded price and the strike price to charity.  I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  will be in line with the PAYB principle, and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it  can  also achieve the objective of a  uniform  lowest\r\n\r\nsuccessful bid.  This will not cause any confusion to the second-hand  car  market  or to the finance companies.   It  will  also\r\n\r\nequitably reflect the market value of cars and at the same time,\r\n\r\nkiasu  bidders  will  be  forced to  exercise  more  caution  in\r\n\r\nsubmitting their bids.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Hon. Members will please note that Dr Michael\r\n\r\nLim's  name  was inadvertently omitted from this list  and  also\r\n\r\nthat  of  Mr  Sin  Boon Ann under item (b) of  the  Order  Paper\r\n\r\nSupplement.  I now call on Dr Michael Lim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  join in the debate.  A land  transport  policy\r\n\r\naffects the daily lives of most Singaporeans and hence it is not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that changes in land transport policies are  watched\r\n\r\nclosely  by most Singaporeans.  The report of the Vehicle  Quota\r\n\r\nSystem   Review Committee was released recently.  I was  also  a\r\n\r\nmember of the Committee.  In view of the concerns that have been\r\n\r\nexpressed  on  some of the changes, I would like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  further  expand on the  proposed  open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommended an open bidding system but it was\r\n\r\nafter a long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndebate  within the Committee that we finally agreed to  try  the\r\n\r\nopen  bidding system in the Open Category.  The reality is  that\r\n\r\nalthough  the  open  bidding  system  is  more  transparent  and\r\n\r\nprovides more information to bidders, the playing field  is  not\r\n\r\nlevel as motor dealers have an edge over ordinary Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if there was collusion, they could control the\r\n\r\noutcome  of  the  bidding, having been given  more  information.\r\n\r\nThey  have the experience, the time to monitor the bids, a large\r\n\r\nnumber  of COEs to have an effect on pricing and the ability  to\r\n\r\nbuffer COE prices with the profit from the sale of the car.  For\r\n\r\na  motor dealer, it is better to have a sale with a lower profit\r\n\r\nmargin than no sale and no profit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee had long debates on the merits and demerits\r\n\r\nof  the  open  bidding  system and there was  genuine  and  real\r\n\r\nconcern that if manipulation can occur to the detriment  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary  Singaporean, it would have defeated  the  aim  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise, which is to have a more transparent and level  playing\r\n\r\nfield for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I wish to take this opportunity to stress to the\r\n\r\nMinister   that   safeguards  against  manipulations   must   be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Several possibilities were discussed but the  only\r\n\r\nway  we can prevent market manipulation is to have a formula  to\r\n\r\npenalise those who manipulate the market by running up  the  COE\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Ministry may argue that we must let the\r\n\r\nmarket determine the prices of the COE.  This, I agree but  with\r\n\r\ncaveats.  Unfortunately, despite the transparency, the odds  are\r\n\r\nstacked  against  the ordinary Singaporean  and  therefore,  the\r\n\r\noutcomes  can  still  be  manipulated.   My  fear  is  that   if\r\n\r\nuncontrolled, the open bidding system can only lead to a running\r\n\r\nup  of  COE prices unnecessarily.  The Government must  consider\r\n\r\nsome schemes to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the release of the Report, I have also given more\r\n\r\nthought to this and I have a suggestion.  One suggestion which I\r\n\r\nwould like to recommend is that for each\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquota  category, let there be a two-tier scheme  with  a  lowest\r\n\r\nsuccessful bid for each tier.  Hence, for example, the  top  10%\r\n\r\nof  the  successful bidders will have to pay the  price  of  the\r\n\r\nlowest successful bid among the top 10%, and the other 90%  will\r\n\r\npay  the  lowest  successful bid.   However,  if  there  was  no\r\n\r\nmanipulation, it is likely that the bids will be within a narrow\r\n\r\nband.   To  avoid penalising bidders if the band is narrow,  the\r\n\r\nsystem  may  incorporate a clause which can state  that  if  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between the two lowest successful bids is  not  more\r\n\r\nthan  10-20%  of  the  lowest successful bid,  then  the  entire\r\n\r\ncategory  will  only pay the lower of the two lowest  successful\r\n\r\nbids.  This scheme will penalise those who run up COE prices and\r\n\r\nyet  will not penalise buyers if bidding is done within a narrow\r\n\r\nband.  This will also reduce the likelihood that COE prices will\r\n\r\nrun up.  It will also dispel the misconception that the exercise\r\n\r\nis meant to increase Government revenue.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now one of my colleagues, Mr Goh Chee Wee, has\r\n\r\nsuggested   that  another  way  is  to  have  frequent   perhaps\r\n\r\nfortnightly, weekly or monthly COE bids.  My only concern is  if\r\n\r\nyou do that, each time the category will be quite small, and  we\r\n\r\nwould have defeated the purpose of merging our categories, which\r\n\r\nwas to have a greater COE pool.  Because, as we discussed, if we\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  small COE pool in each category,  then  there  is\r\n\r\nincreased risk of manipulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations have been agreed and thought through\r\n\r\ncarefully.  Most of these measures can only be successful if the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications not only adopt the  recommendations\r\n\r\nbut devise and set up the necessary administrative safeguards to\r\n\r\nensure   that   these   recommendations   can   be   implemented\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.   Ultimately, I believe that if  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications  follows  the  recommendations   and   adds   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  safeguards, the VQS will evolve  into  a  fairer  and\r\n\r\nbetter system for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  I  would like to thank all the speakers who  have  given\r\n\r\nvery  valuable  inputs and suggestions on the  VQS  review.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  will  recall, we implemented the Vehicle  Quota  System\r\n\r\nalmost nine years ago.  That was in May 1990.  At that time, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  faced  with a dilemma of  how  to  control  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  population.  We had previously relied on vehicle  taxes\r\n\r\nto  do  this.  Before 1990, from 1975 onwards, the vehicle taxes\r\n\r\nlike ARF, registration fees, customs duties and so on kept going\r\n\r\nup.   Every time the vehicle population went up unduly high, you\r\n\r\ncould  be  sure that in the next budget, the car taxes would  go\r\n\r\nup.  But  in  spite of all this, the vehicle population  reached\r\n\r\ndouble  digit  growth of something like 12%  per  annum  in  the\r\n\r\nperiod 1982-1983.  Three years prior to 1990, the net growth was\r\n\r\nalmost  7%.   Obviously, we could not carry on  like  this.   We\r\n\r\neither had to keep on raising taxes and ARF drastically in order\r\n\r\nto  bring the growth down, or we had to fix an acceptable growth\r\n\r\nrate, and let motorists decide how much they want to pay to  own\r\n\r\na car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided to go for the latter option. We\r\n\r\nsettled  one key parameter of the transport equation, which  was\r\n\r\nthe vehicle population and, at the same time, we provided a more\r\n\r\nflexible and market driven solution to the perennial question of\r\n\r\nhow much should we tax car  ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the VQS is quite unique to Singapore. We were the\r\n\r\nfirst  to implement such a system and up to today, we are  still\r\n\r\nthe  only  country in the world to do so.  Many people  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  study  our system and  they  say,  \"Oh,  what  a\r\n\r\nwonderful system you have.  This solves all our problems.\"   But\r\n\r\nwhen they go back, nothing happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we had no other experience to rely on. We had to learn\r\n\r\nas  we  went along, as it were.  Over the last nine years, there\r\n\r\nwere many changes in the system. These changes took into account\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the public as well as responded to the  changing\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Earlier on, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  pressed  to make COEs non-transferable. From the  economic\r\n\r\npoint  of  view, Mr Iswaran will tell you that this is  not  the\r\n\r\nmost  ideal  solution,  because  COEs  as  a  commodity  should,\r\n\r\nstrictly speaking, be transferable, and there should be a market\r\n\r\nfor it.  But people felt that non-transferability was making COE\r\n\r\nprices  go up too high.  We made COEs non-transferable for  cars\r\n\r\nand  motorcycles.   Of course, as expected, this  brought  about\r\n\r\nother consequential problems. We had to make the cars themselves\r\n\r\nnon-transferable.   When COEs could not be  transferred,  people\r\n\r\ndecided  that they would  take the COE, register a car and  then\r\n\r\ntransfer the car.  So we had to plug that loophole, and we did.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, there have been many other suggestions\r\n\r\nmade to further modify the system.  Pay-as-you-bid is a constant\r\n\r\nrefrain.   There  have  also been calls for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nprevent dealers from bidding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the ERP, there have also been\r\n\r\nrenewed calls to abolish the VQS, because with the ERP in place,\r\n\r\nwhy  do  we need the VQS?  Although the VQS is working well  and\r\n\r\nalthough  the prices have been relatively stable over  the  last\r\n\r\nyear or so, as many Members have pointed out, I decided that  it\r\n\r\nwas  timely, after almost 10 years of operation, to  take  stock\r\n\r\nand to do a thorough, comprehensive review of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the suggestions that were put to the Ministry\r\n\r\nearlier, we had kept in view because we did not want to keep  on\r\n\r\nmaking  changes every year.  But we decided that after 10 years,\r\n\r\nafter  watching  the system and seeing what are the  merits  and\r\n\r\ndemerits of the system, this was a sufficiently long time for us\r\n\r\nto sit back and take stock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Iswaran, the objectives of the review were two-fold. One is to review whether the VQS is still needed in view\r\n\r\nof  the  ERP,  and whether it is still effective in meeting  our\r\n\r\ntraffic  management  objectives. Two,  if the  VQS  were  to  be\r\n\r\nretained, how can it be further improved in order\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto make the system fairer and more objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To undertake the review, my Ministry turned to the GPC for\r\n\r\nCommunications  for assistance.  The GPC is  well  qualified  to\r\n\r\nconduct  the  review because its Members are familiar  with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  system.   Moreover, they have recourse to  a  group  of\r\n\r\nresource  persons who would be able to provide expert  views  on\r\n\r\nthe  subject.  Last but not least, I felt that it would be  good\r\n\r\nto  have a party other than the Ministry conduct the review,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can take a fresh look at the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the GPC has undertaken their task in\r\n\r\nearnest.  I have been following their deliberations and  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  have actively sought the views of various interested\r\n\r\nparties  as  well  as members of the public.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nalmost  100 written representations were received via fax,  mail\r\n\r\nand  the  Internet. This is excluding the pile of feedback  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  had  earlier collected which we dutifully  handed\r\n\r\nover  to  the  GPC  Review Committee. They also conducted  three\r\n\r\ndialogue sessions with interest groups, with academics from  NUS\r\n\r\nand  NTU, with the Feedback Unit's transport group and also with\r\n\r\nthe  general members of the public. They spent a lot of time and\r\n\r\neffort in arriving at their recommendations, and I would like to\r\n\r\nplace on record in this House my appreciation and thanks to  the\r\n\r\nGPC,  especially to its Chairman, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, and to  the\r\n\r\nresource persons for undertaking this important task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now give the Government's response to the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the GPC.  First of all, on the  VQS  itself.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry agrees with the GPC that the VQS should remain,  as\r\n\r\nit is one of the key pillars of our traffic management strategy.\r\n\r\nI  note  that many other Members who have spoken today,  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nKian Min, Mr Ang Mong Seng, among others, also share this view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system has allowed us to effectively manage the growth\r\n\r\nof  the  vehicle population at a level that can be sustained  by\r\n\r\nour road infrastructure and given the overall constraints of our\r\n\r\nlimited land.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  am  gratified that almost all who gave feedback  to  the  GPC\r\n\r\nagreed that the VQS should be retained, despite the introduction\r\n\r\nof the ERP.  This is a significant vindication and reaffirmation\r\n\r\nof  the  system.  As the Lianhe Zaobao editorial a few days  ago\r\n\r\nput  it, motorists both love and hate the system.  They love the\r\n\r\nsystem  because it works, and when they travel to  other  cities\r\n\r\nwhich  are gridlocked, they really appreciate the quota  system.\r\n\r\nBut  they are not so keen when it comes to paying for COEs.   So\r\n\r\nthis  love-hate relationship, I think, is going to be a fact  of\r\n\r\nlife.  But I am heartened because when we first implemented  the\r\n\r\nquota system, I do not think there was any love in sight at all.\r\n\r\nIf  anything, it was a hate-hate relationship.   Now, people are\r\n\r\nbeginning to appreciate the benefits of the quota system and see\r\n\r\nthe  impact and recognise that it works.  I think it shows  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  making progress.  It demonstrates that Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nappreciate  the need for Government to take tough but  necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures from time to time to tackle intractable issues such  as\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our land constraint, as many Members have heard me say\r\n\r\nmany times in this House, means that the amount of space that we\r\n\r\ncan  devote  to  roads must be limited.  The vehicle  population\r\n\r\ngrows at 3% per annum compounded, but our land is not growing at\r\n\r\n3%  per  annum.   In fact, between 1995 and 2000, we  anticipate\r\n\r\nthat  our  road network will only grow something like  1/2%  per\r\n\r\nannum, in terms of lane kilometres.  Already, 12% of our land is\r\n\r\nset aside for roads, the same amount of land set aside for roads\r\n\r\nas  for housing, 12%.  So there is not much room for us to build\r\n\r\nmore  roads.   We  can  reclaim at the margins.   We  can  build\r\n\r\ninterchanges,  flyovers, even underground roads,  but  our  road\r\n\r\ncapacity will expand at the most by something like 2%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to rely solely on the ERP to manage\r\n\r\ncongestion.   If  we did so, ERP charges would   be  many  times\r\n\r\nhigher  than what it is today.  Therefore, maintaining a balance\r\n\r\nbetween ownership and usage management measures through VQS  and\r\n\r\nERP is the most prudent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napproach to manage our traffic.  But the GPC feels that with the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  ongoing  improvements  to  the  public   transport\r\n\r\nsystem, expansion of road network, greater reliance on the  ERP,\r\n\r\nthe allowable vehicle growth rate, which is currently set at  3%\r\n\r\nper  annum, could be reviewed upwards.  This is a recommendation\r\n\r\nwhich has created some excitement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the growth rate of 3% was set at the time when the VQS\r\n\r\nwas  first  introduced, taking into account our long-term  road-building programme, our public transport developments as well as\r\n\r\ndevelopments in traffic management systems.  To the extent  that\r\n\r\nthese  factors have changed since the growth rate was  set  nine\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  the  GPC's recommendation to  review  the  rate  is\r\n\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA recently carried out such a study/review using its\r\n\r\ntransportation model, and it simulated the impact of a 3% growth\r\n\r\nrate  on the congestion levels of our roads, taking into account\r\n\r\nthe  various improvements in public transport, road  network  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the introduction of ERP last year.  The study concluded\r\n\r\nthat  if  the ERP coverage and rates are maintained  at  today's\r\n\r\nlevels,  the  congestion level on our road network  will  worsen\r\n\r\nsignificantly over the next five years.  However, if we were  to\r\n\r\nimplement  a  more extensive coverage of ERP and, if  necessary,\r\n\r\nhigher  ERP  charges, we can sustain this 3%  growth  rate,  and\r\n\r\nmanage the congestion at localised bottlenecks. To increase  the\r\n\r\ngrowth rate further at this stage would be unwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to maintain the 3%\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  until  the year 2005, because  we  take  a  5-year\r\n\r\nplanning  horizon.   We will review this growth  rate  regularly\r\n\r\nafter that.  If congestion eases following the expansion of ERP,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will release an additional 10,000 plus COEs.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  further  assess  the  situation  after  we  have\r\n\r\nimplemented phase 2 of the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to methods of COE allocation. The Government\r\n\r\nagrees  with  the  GPC  that the market mechanism  is  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient means for allocation of COEs.  COEs should rightly  go\r\n\r\nto  those  who  value  the  right  to  own  the  car  the  most.\r\n\r\nCompetitive  bidding is the best way to achieve this.   It  also\r\n\r\nensures  that  the scarcity value of COEs accrues to  Government\r\n\r\nand  therefore  to  society  as a  whole  rather  than  to  each\r\n\r\nindividual  if we were to use other allocation methods,  whether\r\n\r\nit is queuing, lucky draws, or whatever.  How do we know whether\r\n\r\nthe  VQS system is efficient?  Is it by allocation of COEs?   Is\r\n\r\nit by COE prices?  This is what Mr Iswaran wanted to know.  Some\r\n\r\nother  Members have mentioned that there is a view,  among  some\r\n\r\npeople, that the changes are to maintain Government revenue from\r\n\r\nCOEs  by ensuring that freak results such as the $50 COE do  not\r\n\r\nrecur.   Members  have asked that we dispel the perception  that\r\n\r\nthese changes are to increase Government revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said on a number of occasions that the VQS is\r\n\r\nan  instrument  to manage traffic.  It is not a tax  instrument.\r\n\r\nAlthough COE revenue has become a significant part of Government\r\n\r\nrevenue, it is not a tax instrument per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COEs are a scarce commodity and they are a national\r\n\r\nresource,  like  land.   Having decided that  the  best  way  to\r\n\r\nallocate  this scarce resource is through the market  mechanism,\r\n\r\nwe must ensure therefore that the bidding system is an efficient\r\n\r\none,  which sets a fair price for the COEs.  We should not over-price  COEs but, on the other hand, neither should we  accept  a\r\n\r\nprice  which is below the fair market price of the COEs, because\r\n\r\nCOEs belong to Singapore and Singaporeans ultimately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the $50 COEs occurred in December\r\n\r\n1997.   Did  that reflect the true value of COEs in that  month?\r\n\r\nObviously not.  If that were the case, then that would have been\r\n\r\nthe  benchmark  price  for  the next few months.  But  the  next\r\n\r\nmonth,  the price bounced back to its original level.  If people\r\n\r\nknew\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  $50  would  be  the price for COEs in that  category  that\r\n\r\nmonth,  I  can  bet  my bottom dollar that  everybody  would  be\r\n\r\nrushing  to the nearest ATM to put in  their bid.  But this  $50\r\n\r\nCOE  did happen.  It is a weakness of the system.  This weakness\r\n\r\nis something that needs to be addressed.  This is the reason why\r\n\r\nI  set for the GPC the other objective of seeing whether the VQS\r\n\r\ncan be improved to make it fairer and more objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now respond to the specific recommendations\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  GPC to improve the mechanics of the  VQS  system.\r\n\r\nFirst, the quota system.  The existing quota formula is based on\r\n\r\nthe  number of vehicles deregistered in the previous year.   The\r\n\r\nGPC  has  proposed to change the formula to base it on estimated\r\n\r\nderegistrations  for the current year instead  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.   This will remove the one year lag between deregistration\r\n\r\nand  recycling of replacement COEs. What this means  effectively\r\n\r\nis that it will better match the supply with the demand of those\r\n\r\nwho   are   scrapping  their  vehicles.   This  is  a   sensible\r\n\r\nsuggestion. The Government accepts this recommendation and  will\r\n\r\nimplement  the new quota formula for this quota year,  beginning\r\n\r\nMay 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the 1999 quota will be based on projected deregistration\r\n\r\nthis  year plus 3% growth of the vehicle population as  at  31st\r\n\r\nDecember  1998.  LTA will estimate the deregistrations for  each\r\n\r\nyear based on the trends of the last few years.  If there is any\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy between estimate and actual, this will be  accounted\r\n\r\nfor in the following year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, smoothening out the peaks in COE supply. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  agrees  in  principle  with  the  recommendation  to\r\n\r\nsmoothen  out the surge in COE supply in the year 2000  and  the\r\n\r\ntroughs   that  would  take  place  before  and  after.    Major\r\n\r\nfluctuations in the year to year COE supply is likely to lead to\r\n\r\ninstability  in  COE  prices, if not  matched  by  corresponding\r\n\r\ndemand.   The  actual  figures will be announced  when  the  LTA\r\n\r\ndetermines the quota for the year 2000 and 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, distribution among categories. The GPC recommended\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  consider a more  dynamic  and  responsive\r\n\r\nmechanism  to distribute COEs to the different categories.   The\r\n\r\naim  is  a  laudable  one  which  is  to  reflect  the  changing\r\n\r\npreference  of  motorists for different kinds of  vehicles.   We\r\n\r\nagree  that the current system is not flexible enough  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose,  but some of the projections that we have made  suggest\r\n\r\nthat any such proposed mechanism will have a major impact on the\r\n\r\nvehicle   mix.   So  my  Ministry  would  like  to   study   the\r\n\r\nimplications  of this proposed mechanism and other alternatives,\r\n\r\nif  possible,  to  the  current  distribution  method  with  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  making sure that it is more responsive.   In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, we will retain the current distribution method.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merging of quota categories. I think this is a\r\n\r\nrecommendation that has generated quite a lot of interest.   The\r\n\r\nGPC  recommended  that  the number of  categories  for  cars  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to  two  while the commercial vehicles and  motorcycles\r\n\r\nremain  in  their separate categories.  Mr Ong Kian Min  and  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai  Yuen, among others, have expressed concern that  this\r\n\r\nmerger  will  result  in  the buyers of  smaller  cars  in  each\r\n\r\ncategory  being squeezed out by the buyers of the  larger  cars.\r\n\r\nBoth  Members have also recommended in one form or another, some\r\n\r\nkind  of  a scaling factor so that big car owners will pay  more\r\n\r\nthan small car owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no question that when the COE system was\r\n\r\nfirst  formulated  there was this need to address  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial equity considerations.  But from the land transport point\r\n\r\nof view, it is also clear that there should only be one category\r\n\r\nof  COEs from which all vehicle buyers will bid.  The reason  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.  As far as congestion is concerned, it is the same\r\n\r\nwhether  you have a large car or a small car, so  the COE  as  a\r\n\r\nproxy  for  the cost of causing that congestion should  be   the\r\n\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a single category will also provide maximum\r\n\r\nflexibility to cater to the changing preference for different\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntypes  of vehicles.  Having a large category, as Dr Wang pointed\r\n\r\nout,  would  also  reduce  price fluctuations.   But  there  are\r\n\r\ncompelling social and business considerations to suggest that we\r\n\r\nare  not ready to implement a single quota category system.   So\r\n\r\nthe recommendation to keep, for example, commercial vehicles and\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  separate  is  an acceptable  one.   The  reason  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have different tax platforms from cars  and  they\r\n\r\nalso cater to different groups of motorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Ong's and Dr Wang's suggestion to\r\n\r\nintroduce  scaling  factors, I think this  suggestion  was  also\r\n\r\nconsidered  by  the  GPC,   but it was not  accepted  after  the\r\n\r\nGovernment gave its view that the VQS is not intended  to  be  a\r\n\r\nprogressive  tax measure.  Progressivity is already  built  into\r\n\r\nthe  cost of owning a vehicle, especially into our motor car tax\r\n\r\nstructure.   For  example, when you buy a big  car,  you  pay  a\r\n\r\nhigher ARF and more customs duty because these two elements  are\r\n\r\nbased  on  the Open Market Value of the car.  So we are  already\r\n\r\ncharging  a wealth tax on the large car owners via the  ARF  and\r\n\r\nthe  customs duty mechanism.  Furthermore, we charge higher road\r\n\r\ntaxes  when  these cars are put on the road.  So the  Government\r\n\r\nfeels  that there is really no need for us to introduce  another\r\n\r\nprogressivity element into another aspect of the land  transport\r\n\r\ntax  structure or cost structure, which is in this case the COE.\r\n\r\nThis  is a deliberate decision that we have taken.  Yes, I agree\r\n\r\nthat people would not mind if Government were to say, \"Okay,  we\r\n\r\nare going to have a progressivity element into the COE structure\r\n\r\nas well.\"  But is it necessary?  After all, when we first mooted\r\n\r\nthe  COE  system,  we  said  that  this  is  to  tackle  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.  Let us just leave it at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, having said all that, it is true that a single car\r\n\r\ncategory  will result in buyers of big cars squeezing out  small\r\n\r\ncars.   So  as  an interim measure, the Government  accepts  the\r\n\r\nGPC's  recommendations to reduce the number  of  car  categories\r\n\r\nfrom  four  to  two.  We merge Categories 1 and 2 together,  and\r\n\r\nthen we merge Categories 3\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  4  together.   Buyers of small cars, by which  I  refer  to\r\n\r\nCategories  1  and 2, will not have to compete  with  buyers  of\r\n\r\nbigger  cars,  those in Categories 3 and  4.   If  you  look  at\r\n\r\nCategories 1 and 2, you will see that the quota premiums have in\r\n\r\nrecent  months started to converge.  There is still a difference\r\n\r\nbut  the difference has come down very sharply.  In fact,  there\r\n\r\nwas  even one occasion when, as Mr Chew Heng Ching pointed  out,\r\n\r\nCategory 1 COEs were actually higher than Category 2 COEs.   One\r\n\r\nof  the  reasons for this was because there was  a  mismatch  of\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand, and the supply of Category 1 COEs  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall  every month.  In that particular month, when there was  a\r\n\r\nsurge  of  buyers for very small cars, Category 1 COEs  went  up\r\n\r\nsharply.  Having a larger category for small cars, whether it is\r\n\r\nbelow  1,000 cc or between 1,000 cc and 1,600 cc, will  help  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  upward pressure on the COE price for the  small  cars.\r\n\r\nFor  Categories  3 and 4, I think it is much less  controversial\r\n\r\nbecause  the two COE premiums are generally similar and  so  the\r\n\r\nmerging of these two categories makes sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to the Open Category. The Government agrees\r\n\r\nwith  the  GPC that the Open Category should be retained.   This\r\n\r\nmechanism of the Open Category was implemented when we segmented\r\n\r\nall the car categories into various compartments.  Ideally, as I\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier, they should all be one.  But because  of  various\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  we  split  them up  into  six.   The  COE  Open\r\n\r\nCategory  is  a  mechanism to cater for changes  in  the  market\r\n\r\nplace.   If there is a change in demand for different  types  of\r\n\r\nvehicles, the Open Category can cater for this because it can be\r\n\r\nused to register any type of vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several Members have pointed out, including Dr Wang, the\r\n\r\nOpen  Category COEs have been used mainly for the  bigger  cars.\r\n\r\nBut  this  has  not always been the case.  In  fact,  in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths,  and  last year especially, about 40% of  Open  Category\r\n\r\nCOEs were used to register smaller cars.  And in the past, these\r\n\r\nCOEs had also been used to register commercial vehicles.  So  it\r\n\r\nis not clear cut.  It is not preordained that Open Category COEs\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nused  for  the  larger  cars.  Things do change  as  the  market\r\n\r\nchanges.    In  conjunction  with  the  review  of   the   quota\r\n\r\ndistribution  mechanism, my Ministry will review the  proportion\r\n\r\nof COEs to be allocated to the Open Category.  At the moment, it\r\n\r\nis  25%.   We will continue with the 25%, but in the review,  we\r\n\r\nwill see whether this figure should be changed.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking all these factors into account, the GPC report,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's response, and based on this new quota formula,\r\n\r\nI would like to announce that the total number of COEs available\r\n\r\nfor the next quota year from 1st May 1999 to 30th April 2000  is\r\n\r\n68,191.  This quota is about 42% higher than the quota for 1998.\r\n\r\nAs  there  is  unlikely to be much change in the  month-to-month\r\n\r\nquota,  there is no need to announce the quota every six months,\r\n\r\nas the GPC suggested in its report.  Details of the distribution\r\n\r\nwill  be  announced by LTA shortly.  I just want to further  add\r\n\r\nthat  with  the  merger of the car COEs, the five categories  of\r\n\r\nCOEs will be renamed Categories A to E.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we had used the existing formula, the COE quota for\r\n\r\nthis  year would have been slightly over 70,000.  This is  about\r\n\r\n4%  higher than the quota based on the new formula that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to use.  In its report, the GPC had suggested that we do a\r\n\r\none-time  adjustment, that means, we add the difference  to  the\r\n\r\nquota to make up this difference.  I have considered this.   But\r\n\r\nsince this year's quota is already significantly higher than the\r\n\r\n1998 quota, I have decided not to make this adjustment.  We will\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation and, if necessary, inject additional  COEs\r\n\r\nafter the implementation of the ERP Phase 2 later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the auction method, again another relatively\r\n\r\ncontroversial subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current system used is the lowest successful bid (LSB)\r\n\r\nmethod.   The  GPC recommended that this method be retained  but\r\n\r\nalso  recommended that an open bidding system be  considered  to\r\n\r\ngive more responsive information and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngreater  transparency.  And it recommended that we try this  out\r\n\r\nin  the  Open Category.  As Members are aware, there  are  many,\r\n\r\nmany  different auction systems in the world and  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSome  are  used to auction hogs, some are used to auction  cars,\r\n\r\nsome  flowers, others stocks and shares, which  is a very common\r\n\r\nexample.   Each of these systems has its strength and  weakness.\r\n\r\nSo  we  need  to  look for a system that can suit  our  specific\r\n\r\nsituation, a system that people generally accept to be fair  and\r\n\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many calls from Members in this House as\r\n\r\nwell  as  members  of the public to implement  a  pay-as-you-bid\r\n\r\nsystem.  The main reason behind such calls is the belief that  a\r\n\r\npay-as-you-bid  system  will  result  in  lower  premiums.   The\r\n\r\nthinking  is  that with the lowest successful  bid,  people  are\r\n\r\nencouraged to bid high because they do not have to pay.  In  the\r\n\r\npay-as-you-bid   system,  everybody  is  more  responsible   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  you bid responsibly.  However, if you take  a  closer\r\n\r\nscrutiny  of the results of the tenders for the last months,  if\r\n\r\nnot years, I think you will find that this is not the case, that\r\n\r\nactually in the current lowest successful bid system, people  do\r\n\r\nnot  generally bid irresponsibly.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock  had  given\r\n\r\nsome  details earlier about some of the bidding patterns.  These\r\n\r\nresults  are available to members of the public.  In fact,  they\r\n\r\nare released to members of the press.  Anybody who is interested\r\n\r\ncan  go  to the LTA and get all these details.  My Ministry  has\r\n\r\nanalysed  the numbers and we do not see any evidence that  there\r\n\r\nis  this  very  irresponsible bidding pattern that  people  have\r\n\r\nattributed to the lowest successful bid system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Government agrees with the GPC's recommendation that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  implement the pay-as-you-bid in the closed  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem.  There is no evidence to suggest that the pay-as-you-bid\r\n\r\nsystem  is superior to the lowest successful bid system. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  there are several disadvantages of the pay-as-you-bid  system.  These are cited in the GPC report and I  will  not\r\n\r\nrepeat them here, except to say that I agree with the reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also agrees with the GPC that the open\r\n\r\nbidding  system  merits  serious  consideration.   With  greater\r\n\r\ntransparency and more information, individuals will be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  more  informed and rational decisions based  on  the  full\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the prevailing market situation.  Many Members  in\r\n\r\nthis House, including Dr Toh See Kiat and Mr Chew Heng Ching, as\r\n\r\nwell  as many others outside, have expressed fears that an  open\r\n\r\nbidding  system  will irrationally drive up prices,  leading  to\r\n\r\nhigher  premiums.   I  think  all  of  us  attend  Seventh  Moon\r\n\r\nauctions.   Most of us do anyway.  We all cheer when the  prices\r\n\r\ngo up.  The organisers are happy.  The beneficiaries, whether  a\r\n\r\ncharity  or  a  grassroots organisation, are  also  happy.   The\r\n\r\nsuccessful  bidders are also happy.  Because  he  is  a  willing\r\n\r\nbuyer  of  a product that is being sold to him.  It is a  scarce\r\n\r\ncommodity.   Whether it is \"or kim\", a piece of black  gold,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it is an engraved plaque that somebody has put  up  for\r\n\r\nauction,  this  scarce commodity has been sold  to  the  highest\r\n\r\nbidder. Nobody twisted his arm to bid for it, but he was  happy.\r\n\r\nSo it is with COEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open bidding system, people who value or who want\r\n\r\nthat COE in that particular month will go for it.  They will bid\r\n\r\nhigh for it.  That is what an auction system is all about.   And\r\n\r\nthe revenues from COEs also go towards a good cause, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  for  roads,  MRT, schools, or other public projects.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  not  get carried away.  The  bidding  system,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is a closed system or an open system, is essentially\r\n\r\nan  auction  for  a  scarce commodity.  In itself,  any  auction\r\n\r\nsystem,  whether it is an open or closed bidding system,  should\r\n\r\nnot  lead  to  higher prices.  The price, in this case  the  COE\r\n\r\npremium,  ultimately will be decided by the  bidders,  based  on\r\n\r\ninformation that are available to them, the supply of COEs,  the\r\n\r\nmarket economy, or their own situation, as Dr Wang pointed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a closed bid, such information is not readily available.\r\n\r\nSo there is that element of luck involved.  You put your bid in.\r\n\r\nIf you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  more  informed,  you tend to have a higher  probability  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   If you are less informed, chances are that you  would\r\n\r\nnot  get  your COE.  But in an open system, the bidders will  be\r\n\r\nfully aware of what the prevailing bids are.  Their own bid will\r\n\r\nalso  be  a deliberate one.  Every one will have easy access  to\r\n\r\nthe  same amount of information.  So in that respect, I  support\r\n\r\nthe  view of the GPC that an open bidding system will result  in\r\n\r\nbetter  informed and, hence, more rational and more  responsible\r\n\r\nbidding.   I  think this is a worthwhile objective  which  every\r\n\r\nvehicle buyer will support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand and it is natural that there will be some\r\n\r\nanxiety  and  apprehension  about  new  systems.   Some  Members\r\n\r\nincluding Mr Ong Kian Min have asked: why change, why not  stick\r\n\r\nto  the same thing, why introduce uncertainty? The answer is, if\r\n\r\nwe  can  have  something better, why not?  So is it  better?   I\r\n\r\nthink  that is a key question.  Is it better than what  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday?   Is it really a new system?  People are anxious  because\r\n\r\nthey  say this is something new.  I think Mr Chay did point  out\r\n\r\nthat  this is not a new system. Share markets, currency  markets\r\n\r\ntrade  daily on stock and monetary exchanges on an open  bidding\r\n\r\nsystem.   There are many, many sites on the Internet where  open\r\n\r\nelectronic  bids are quite common. E-bay is one  that  comes  to\r\n\r\nmind.   I  think  there are many others, both  overseas  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars are now being sold on an open bidding system\r\n\r\nelectronically.   Traders in New Zealand  buy  second-hand  cars\r\n\r\nfrom  Japan, and they bid for them on an open electronic bidding\r\n\r\nsystem, a system which incidentally is managed and operated  out\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Second-hand motor traders in Singapore, I  know,\r\n\r\nare  now  thinking of using a similar system to allow people  to\r\n\r\nbuy  and  sell second-hand cars, again using an on-line  auction\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think there is really that much to fear about\r\n\r\nan  open bidding system transacted on-line.  However, I do agree\r\n\r\nthat  there  are many technical issues that need to  be  settled\r\n\r\nbefore we go ahead with this system.  We need to settle things\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  how  to  prevent  last  minute  bidding,  how  to  prevent\r\n\r\nmanipulation,  and so on.  My Ministry will study the  mechanics\r\n\r\nof  this open bidding system in greater detail.  And we hope  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  trial  of this system within a  year.   While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  accepting in-principle the trial,  we  have  not\r\n\r\nfinalised whether this will be held in the Open Category, and we\r\n\r\nare  open to suggestions on how to implement the trial.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  Members  that the  Government  will  carefully\r\n\r\nconsider  all  the possible pitfalls of the open bidding  system\r\n\r\nbefore we go ahead with it.  As Dr Toh See Kiat mentioned, there\r\n\r\nare many reservations or possible pitfalls in such a system.  In\r\n\r\nthe  meantime,  we  will stick with the current  closed  system,\r\n\r\nbased  on  the lowest successful bid price.  We will not  change\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as information is concerned, Mr Ang Mong Seng asked\r\n\r\nfor more information.  We will gladly give members of the public\r\n\r\nall  the information that is already available at LTA.  We  will\r\n\r\ntry to put them onto the LTA web-site.  In fact, many members of\r\n\r\nthe  public who were involved in the dialogue sessions with  the\r\n\r\nGPC  were not even aware that information of the tender results,\r\n\r\nincluding  their  own tenders, with their IC numbers  and  their\r\n\r\ntender  price,  were  available at LTA.   Such  information  was\r\n\r\navailable to members of the public but they were not aware.   So\r\n\r\nwe  will  make this information more available on the  LTA  web-site.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that the review of the VQS\r\n\r\nhas  been  a worthwhile exercise.  There is a general  consensus\r\n\r\nthat  the  VQS  should be retained.  It is serving its  purpose.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are several recommendations to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsystem.    The   Government   has   accepted   most    of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations.   Others  would  be  considered  for   possible\r\n\r\nimplementation  at  a later date, such as open  bidding.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that these changes will result in a system  which  is\r\n\r\nfairer  and more efficient and which, hopefully, we do not  need\r\n\r\nto tinker with for quite a long while.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, would you like to continue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a question\r\n\r\non  Electronic Road Pricing.  The Government intends  to  extend\r\n\r\nthis ERP system.  I have received feedback from a member of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  According to this gentleman, he agrees that ERP and COE\r\n\r\nsystems  are necessary features.  But what are the criteria  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  sets for evaluation before it extends the  ERP?   By\r\n\r\nwhat  performance indicators do we measure whether the extension\r\n\r\nof  the  ERP  is  justified?  When traffic  flow  in  a  certain\r\n\r\nlocation is below the standard set, his question is: who  is  at\r\n\r\nfault?   Is it because the authority did not build enough egress\r\n\r\nor  ingress  roads to relieve the choked points?  Or were  there\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient improvements to public transport so that  people\r\n\r\nhave  to  continue to drive along that patch  of  road?   Should\r\n\r\nthere  therefore not be a built-up or a monitoring  period  when\r\n\r\ninformation is transparent to the public as to the traffic  flow\r\n\r\nsituation and the alternative measures that are  in place before\r\n\r\nraising the ERP charges once the traffic flow in that area drops\r\n\r\nbelow  a certain target?  I hope the Minister can enlighten  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I would like to reiterate my\r\n\r\nsupport for the COE and the ERP.  Both measures are necessary to\r\n\r\ncontrol  our vehicle population and restrain road usage  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term.  Indeed with the ERP, motorists are now more careful\r\n\r\nin  planning their roads.  Some have even shifted to taking  MRT\r\n\r\nand buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two concerns by Singaporeans\r\n\r\narising from the ERP.  The first concern relates to the loss  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  to  the  Government as a result of  the  ERP.   It  was\r\n\r\nreported  recently in the local press that the  Government  road\r\n\r\nrevenue  actually dropped to $5.8 million a month on the average\r\n\r\nunder  the  ERP system as compared to a revenue of $9.3  million\r\n\r\nper  month  under  the ALS system.  Some motorists  are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion, Sir, that because of this drop in revenue, the LTA  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  quickly  adjust the ERP charges  upwards  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninstall more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngantries  to collect more revenue.  In doing so, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  recover the shortfall in road revenue.  I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  clarifications on this observation and reassure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the ERP exercise is not driven by revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern, Sir, relates to the congestion on the\r\n\r\nCTE despite the introduction of ERP there.  There has been a lot\r\n\r\nof  concern from the public that one of the reasons why  pricing\r\n\r\non  the  CTE  has  not  had  a significant  impact  in  reducing\r\n\r\ncongestion is mainly due to the lack of a better alternative  or\r\n\r\nalternatives.  I believe the North-East MRT Line when  completed\r\n\r\nwill  present a fairly good alternative, but that is  some  time\r\n\r\naway.   In the meantime, Sir, demand for use of the CTE  appears\r\n\r\nto  be  very  price  inelastic.  Sure, at each  level  of  price\r\n\r\nincrease, some motorists would be priced out.  However, we  have\r\n\r\nto  consider, Sir, at what cost, especially in the light of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic difficulties faced by motorists and businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CTE is inevitably a crucial part of our road\r\n\r\nsystem  and we should perhaps avoid the regressive use of  price\r\n\r\nas  the  only  consideration.  Any further hike in  ERP  charges\r\n\r\nalong  the  CTE  could  lead to increased  cost  burden  to  our\r\n\r\nmotorists and businesses if there are no better alternatives  or\r\n\r\ntransport  options.   I  think we could afford  some  degree  of\r\n\r\ntolerance  for  some form of congestion along the  CTE  until  a\r\n\r\nbetter  alternative  transport  system  is  made  available.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  urge  the Minister to go slow on increasing  the  ERP\r\n\r\ncharges along the CTE.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, the general understanding of the\r\n\r\nrationale of the ERP system is that it is a device, a mechanism,\r\n\r\nto  manage traffic flow to keep it smooth in order to not hinder\r\n\r\nproductive  activity  and facilitate economic  growth.   So  the\r\n\r\nlogic  of  the  focus of the scheme in the past  was  geographic\r\n\r\nfocus in terms of CBD areas and the arterial roads leading  into\r\n\r\nthe  CBD and its focus on time in terms of peak hours and office\r\n\r\nhours  was quite apparent.  And I think in general, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave come to regard the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nERP as a system to redistribute road usage in space and time  in\r\n\r\nsupport of an economic objective.  But recent announcements  and\r\n\r\nprogressive changes in the system appear to suggest  that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a deviation from that original purpose.  For example,\r\n\r\nthe  system  has  been  extended from the morning  peak  to  the\r\n\r\nevening peak to the intervening office hours to the CTE and  the\r\n\r\nECP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also announced that the scheme may be\r\n\r\nextended  to areas fringing the CBD areas and also to  the  AYE.\r\n\r\nThis   suggests  that  the  focus  has  now  become  purely   on\r\n\r\noptimisation of road usage.  It may be measured in terms of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic flow, speed of traffic, etc, but without regard  to  how\r\n\r\nimportant  regulation of road usage in these  areas  is  to  the\r\n\r\noverall economic objective.  I would venture to suggest that  as\r\n\r\nwe move further away from some of the core economic centres, the\r\n\r\neconomic  rationale diminishes and it becomes more of optimising\r\n\r\na  scarce resource, in this case, roads.  If we take that  logic\r\n\r\nto  the  limit, then we would have 24-hour coverage  island-wide\r\n\r\nfor the ERP system and I assume that is not the objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister for a clarification on what\r\n\r\nbasis  the ERP system coverage will be extended and an assurance\r\n\r\nthat it will not indeed be a 24-hour coverage island-wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the ERP\r\n\r\nsystem has been well-received.  The Ministry and the LTA deserve\r\n\r\nto be congratulated for the smooth implementation of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one now doubts the usefulness of the ERP in regulating\r\n\r\ntraffic.   Of  course, it can be improved, as some Members  have\r\n\r\nalready pointed out.  For example, in the case of the CTE,  some\r\n\r\nserious  thoughts  need  to be paid to  the  heavy  built-up  of\r\n\r\ntraffic in expressways around 7.00 am or around 5.00 pm or  6.00\r\n\r\npm  near the Braddell areas where vehicles virtually crawl along\r\n\r\nfor  about  a kilometre.  But on the whole, one may be satisfied\r\n\r\nwith the general effectiveness of the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we read of complaints about ERP and the in-vehicle unit (IU). Specifically, there were complaints about\r\n\r\nthe  time  it  takes  for  the cashcard to  be  readable  before\r\n\r\nreaching  the  ERP gantries.  Quite a few people remain  unhappy\r\n\r\neven after LTA has replied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to raise two issues. The first is by treating\r\n\r\ndefaulters who did not insert their cashcards in time as  having\r\n\r\ncommitted  a  criminal  offence.  The second  related  issue  is\r\n\r\nfining  them  $30  for  the offence.  This  was,  I  understand,\r\n\r\nalready reduced from $70.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of the criminal law should be carefully\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  In the case of traffic offences, the primary reason\r\n\r\nfor  using  the  criminal  law is to  protect  the  public  from\r\n\r\nspeeding or drunk drivers where road safety is an issue.  We can\r\n\r\nand  should contrast that with the ERP, which is solely for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  regulating traffic.  It is one of those  victimless\r\n\r\ncrimes  where no one is seen to be suffering directly  from  the\r\n\r\nact in question.  In such a case, I believe that it is wrong  to\r\n\r\ncriminalise such conduct.  No one with any sense would be trying\r\n\r\ndeliberately to cheat a sophisticated electronic system such  as\r\n\r\nthe  ERP,  at least not with a simple method of not inserting  a\r\n\r\ncashcard.   In  other  words, I believe  that  the  few  hundred\r\n\r\ndrivers  who are booked daily for not having cashcards in  their\r\n\r\nIUs  are  just  careless.   Should such carelessness  attract  a\r\n\r\ncriminal sanction?  I think not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the solution lies in treating\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  simply as deferred payment cases.  The  ERP  system\r\n\r\nalready takes a record of the so-called offending vehicle.   The\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  driver, etc, are easily  obtainable  from  the\r\n\r\nrecords  of  the  LTA.  The driver can be billed  later  and  an\r\n\r\nadditional  administrative surcharge can be made.  Interest  can\r\n\r\nbe  charged on outstanding transactions.  For example, one could\r\n\r\nsay  that  LTA  has  to take steps to recover  the  minimum  sum\r\n\r\npayable  with at least $5 plus an entry charge.  I have  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  look forward to the day when drivers can choose to  pay\r\n\r\neither  through cashcards or, if not, through a billing  system,\r\n\r\nsay, at the end of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neach  month.   To  minimise  inconvenience,  LTA  may  wish   to\r\n\r\nstipulate that any such person choosing this method has to do it\r\n\r\nby  GIRO and subject to an administrative charge.  At least, one\r\n\r\nwould have a good idea of the monthly cost of using a car in the\r\n\r\nvarious ERP zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the argument further, anyone who defaults on a\r\n\r\ndeferred  payment may not be permitted to renew the car  licence\r\n\r\nwithout  full payment plus interest, some other surcharge,  such\r\n\r\nas  that  applied in credit card transactions.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nforeign  cars without IU devices, it may indeed be a  preferable\r\n\r\nway  of charging them.  They can pay when they leave or the next\r\n\r\ntime  when they enter the country, if they come back at all.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that there will be an enormous problem with  this.\r\n\r\nAs  it  is, foreign cars coming into Singapore have to  do  with\r\n\r\ntemporary units, which are costly, and I believe unfriendly.  It\r\n\r\nfollows  from what I have said before that I think the $30  fine\r\n\r\nis  too  much.  Once again, we are not really dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nroad safety issue.  We need not fine drivers so heavily for  the\r\n\r\nso-called offence.  The fine should be immediately reduced to  a\r\n\r\nlesser  sum  which  I  think  should  be  the  entry  fee   plus\r\n\r\nadministrative charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that had LTA taken this view that we are\r\n\r\nnot   talking  about  criminal  sanctions,  it  would  not  have\r\n\r\ngenerated the somewhat heated exchange between LTA and those who\r\n\r\nhave written to the press.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one acquaintance of mine referred to the ERP as\r\n\r\nstanding  for \"Excessive Recurring Penalties\".  I hope  that  it\r\n\r\ncan  instead  stand for \"Effortless, Reasonable Pricing\"  and  I\r\n\r\nurge the Minister and the LTA to consider this seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since\r\n\r\nits implementation, the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system has\r\n\r\nbeen  proven  to  be  significantly effective  in  changing  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  pattern  of  road  users  and  in  alleviating  road\r\n\r\ncongestion.   I  can remember that prior to the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  road pricing system, driving along CTE between 8.00 am  and\r\n\r\n<br>9.30 am was a nightmare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNow,  we  can even accurately forecast the number of minutes  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  travel from the north to south to get  into  the  city\r\n\r\narea.   As  such,  I  agree with the Government's  intention  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  developing  this scheme and  to  expand  the  area  of\r\n\r\ncoverage of the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope that the Government will not treat the ERP\r\n\r\nas  a  panacea for all ailments.  In my view, the ERP is only  a\r\n\r\nconvenient  and inexpensive \"Po Chai Pill\".  If the  problem  is\r\n\r\nnot  very  serious, it can be taken for some quick relief.   But\r\n\r\nfor  the  heavily  congested bottlenecks, we have  to  think  of\r\n\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give you an illustration. Blockage of cardiac\r\n\r\nblood vessel is quite common nowadays in Singapore.  During  the\r\n\r\ninitial  stage of blockage, it can be cured by medication,  just\r\n\r\nspend  more  money and take the more expensive special  medicine\r\n\r\nfor  it  and the blood vessels may be cleared.  However, if  the\r\n\r\ncondition  turns worse, then the patient will  have  to  go  for\r\n\r\nsurgery  and  the specialist will insert a metal  stent  in  his\r\n\r\nblood  vessel.  If our roads are in such a situation, LTA should\r\n\r\nconsider  building  some  viaducts  or  tunnels  to  clear   the\r\n\r\ncongestion.   As for total blockage where the blood vessels  are\r\n\r\nbeyond remedy, a bypass cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consider the Northeast part of Singapore where my\r\n\r\nconstituency  is  situated.   With  the  rapid  development   of\r\n\r\nHougang,  Sengkang and Punggol 21, some 1,000 residential  units\r\n\r\nare  being  churned out every month.  What we need  there  is  a\r\n\r\nbypass.   Apart from the NEL (North-East Line), we need  also  a\r\n\r\nNEE  (North-East Expressway) because the CTE is fast becoming  a\r\n\r\ntotally blocked artery which is beyond remedy.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me\r\n\r\nto  join  in  the  debate  at this point  of  time.   Since  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the ERP, we have various  successes  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation.  In some cases, the ERP has an effect of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmoothening traffic flow and in other cases, the situation seems\r\n\r\nto  have worsened.  At the sitting of Parliament in October last\r\n\r\nyear, the Minister for Communications did mention that since the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the first phase of ERP in September 1998,  the\r\n\r\nCTE  traffic  congestion  had worsened with  the  average  speed\r\n\r\nfalling  to  35  to  50 kilometres an hour which  is  below  the\r\n\r\noptimal level of 50 to 55 kilometres an hour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the LTA would be looking at\r\n\r\nthe CTE problem closely and would make the necessary adjustments\r\n\r\non ERP rates in order to smoothen the traffic flow.  Since then,\r\n\r\nthe ERP rates to the CTE have been revised.  Goods vehicles have\r\n\r\nhad  their charges increased because it was discovered that  the\r\n\r\ngoods vehicles were primarily contributing to the congestion  at\r\n\r\nthe CTE during peak hours.  Since the revision of rates, it does\r\n\r\nnot  appear  to me that traffic flow along the CTE  during  peak\r\n\r\nhours  has  improved substantially.  I do not have the  relevant\r\n\r\ndata   or   statistics.    However,  based   on   my   empirical\r\n\r\nobservations, I notice that between 8.30 am and 9.30 am, traffic\r\n\r\nis  at  its peak despite the revised ERP charges.  Traffic along\r\n\r\nthe  CTE is at times bumper to bumper, and it stretches all  the\r\n\r\nway from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 to the Balestier turnoff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Communications whether\r\n\r\nthe  traffic  situation  along the CTE  has  remained  the  same\r\n\r\ndespite  the  revision  of the ERP rates  and,  if  so,  whether\r\n\r\nfurther  measures can be taken to smoothen the flow  of  traffic\r\n\r\nalong  the  CTE.  And like my colleagues before me, I  certainly\r\n\r\nhope  that the further measures taken by the Ministry would  not\r\n\r\nresult  in additional or greater charges to the motorists  using\r\n\r\nthe CTE.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, when we were discussing the Vehicle\r\n\r\nQuota  System review, I mentioned that the Vehicle Quota  System\r\n\r\nis one of the key pillars of our traffic management strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are talking about the second pillar of our traffic\r\n\r\nmanagement strategy which is electronic road pricing.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe difference between what we introduced last year and what  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  practising for the last 24 years is simply  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  mechanised it.  We just added the \"E\" to  the  \"RP\".  Road\r\n\r\npricing is something that we have practised since 1975.  With 24\r\n\r\nyears  of  experience  in road pricing, there  is  no  doubt  in\r\n\r\nanybody's  mind now that it works.  Motorists who use our  roads\r\n\r\nnow  are more conscious about planning their journeys and  those\r\n\r\nwho do not find it worthwhile will either change the time of the\r\n\r\njourney  or  they change their routes. There is  something  else\r\n\r\nwhich the Ministry would like to see more of, that is, shift  to\r\n\r\npublic  transport  or car pool. Those who are  prepared  to  pay\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  relatively  smoother and faster  ride.   But  is  that\r\n\r\nsufficient?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to take Mr Chay's query on how\r\n\r\nwe are going to assess the criteria of adjusting ERP, whether it\r\n\r\nis  the  rates  or  the  locations.  As far  as  the  rates  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  objective of ERP is really to smoothen  traffic\r\n\r\nflow,  that is, to optimise the usage of our roads.  I  use  the\r\n\r\nword \"optimise\" because this means that we do not want the roads\r\n\r\nto  be  under utilised, as much as we do not want it to be  over\r\n\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, LTA mentioned that it will be reviewing the\r\n\r\nERP  rates on a quarterly basis and this will be done  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing  traffic  conditions.   LTA  has  finalised  the\r\n\r\ncriteria governing ERP rate changes and will be announcing  them\r\n\r\nshortly.  The first rate adjustment will be made on  1st  April,\r\n\r\nnext month.  As I said earlier, we do not want roads to be under\r\n\r\nutilised,  neither do we want it to be over congested.   So,  if\r\n\r\nroads  are  under utilised in this review, rates will  go  down.\r\n\r\nConversely, if congestion has worsened, rates will go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew and indirectly, Mr Iswaran, also expressed some\r\n\r\nconcern about the side effects of the ERP. For example, will  it\r\n\r\nmove  congestion away from those roads that are priced to  those\r\n\r\nthat are unpriced outside the CBD area?  With road pricing,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmotorists  have  a  choice.  They can  either  choose  a  smooth\r\n\r\njourney  or  they can use the unpriced roads and  tolerate  some\r\n\r\ncongestion  or  some delays.  Whether that congestion  level  is\r\n\r\ntolerable  or  not, really depends on the individual  motorists.\r\n\r\nSome  are  prepared to tolerate very high levels of  congestion,\r\n\r\nothers  do not want to see a single traffic light.  So, this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  was  taking  place in the early stages  of  road  pricing.\r\n\r\nHowever, over time, we must expect that the unpriced roads  will\r\n\r\nbecome   more  and  more  congested.   Our  vehicle   population\r\n\r\ncontinues  to grow, 3% on the average per annum compounded  over\r\n\r\nthe last nine years, more than that earlier.  According to LTA's\r\n\r\ntraffic  surveys,  the  traffic  conditions  outside  the  city,\r\n\r\nbetween   the   CBD   and  the  outer  ring  zone,   have   been\r\n\r\ndeteriorating.   In fact, the roads just outside the  restricted\r\n\r\nzone  have  become  more congested than those within  the  zone.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the traffic in the region between the CBD  and  outer\r\n\r\nring roads --- a series of roads which include Queensway, Farrer\r\n\r\nRoad,  Adam  Road, Lornie Road, all the way to  Braddell,  Upper\r\n\r\nAljunied, Mountbatten and Fort Road --- areas like Thomson Road,\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon Road, MacPherson Road, Rochor Road, these areas\r\n\r\nare  all beginning to experience more and more severe congestion\r\n\r\nduring  peak hours.  LTA has measured some of the travel  speeds\r\n\r\nin these areas and some of them have actually fallen below 20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you project the situation forward, if you do a\r\n\r\nsimulation,  you will see, and this is what LTA has  done,  that\r\n\r\nthe  congestion  level of these roads will worsen  significantly\r\n\r\nduring  the next few years if nothing is done.  What  does  this\r\n\r\nmean?   Even if you have a very congestion free CBD, if you  are\r\n\r\ndriving  into the CBD from outside, you will find that  it  will\r\n\r\ntake  you  longer to get to your destination.  You have  got  to\r\n\r\nbattle  through the jams on the outer ring roads before you  can\r\n\r\neven get to the CBD.  And obviously, this is going to completely\r\n\r\nnullify  the  positive effects of the various measures  that  we\r\n\r\nhave taken to keep the CBD congestion free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with road pricing and with traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion tells us that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  to nip this problem in the bud before it gets worse.   So,\r\n\r\nwe  have to move away from the idea that ERP is only for the CBD\r\n\r\nand expressways.  Indeed, if we look back at our history of road\r\n\r\npricing,  as Mr Iswaran pointed out just now, it was clear  that\r\n\r\nas  vehicle population grew, congestion slowly but surely spread\r\n\r\nfrom  the  CBD  onto  the ring roads, and the  expressways.   We\r\n\r\nstarted  out  with ALS in the CBD in 1975 for the  morning  peak\r\n\r\nonly.  As traffic grew, we extended the ALS to the evening  peak\r\n\r\nin  1989.  In 1994, traffic started to build up again in between\r\n\r\nthe  two  peaks, so we had to implement ALS throughout the  day.\r\n\r\nThen, the expressways became congested.  So we implemented  road\r\n\r\npricing  on  the  expressways, first, on East Coast  Parkway  in\r\n\r\n1995, then on the CTE and the PIE in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost unavoidable that we will have to tackle the\r\n\r\nincreasing congestion problem on the ring roads.  To  answer  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran,  while the policy objective of the ERP has not changed,\r\n\r\nit  remains one of optimising road space. We will have to extend\r\n\r\nERP to tackle congestion where and when it exacts a toll on road\r\n\r\nusers, and consequently, on the economy and our way of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congestion has moved beyond the CBD and the expressways to\r\n\r\nthe ring roads.  We have to expand ERP in tandem.  Whether there\r\n\r\nwill  be a 24-hour coverage of the ERP throughout the island  is\r\n\r\nnot  for me to say now. But if we had traffic congestion for  24\r\n\r\nhours  a  day, do you think we should also have ERP 24  hours  a\r\n\r\nday?  I think that is an interesting question, which I will  not\r\n\r\nanswer   now.  But  if  the  situation  arises  where  we   have\r\n\r\nintolerable  traffic congestion and our roads  are  clogged  and\r\n\r\nthere is a cost associated with that, should not we make use  of\r\n\r\nall the available measures to tackle the problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second phase of the ERP implementation plan, LTA\r\n\r\nhas  recommended implementing this additional cordon outside the\r\n\r\nCBD.  This will be done progressively with effect from September\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1999.    The   cordon   will  include  the  existing   congested\r\n\r\nbottlenecks  like  the  PIE at Adam Road  in  the  direction  of\r\n\r\nChangi,  Thomson Road, Bendemeer Road and Kallang  Road  towards\r\n\r\nthe  city.   The  exact gantry locations and the ERP  rates  are\r\n\r\nstill  under  study  and will depend on the  prevailing  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions  at  those points during morning peak periods.   This\r\n\r\ncordon, to answer Mr Iswaran, will also include a point  on  the\r\n\r\nAYE.   I  previously indicated that the AYE would  be  the  next\r\n\r\nplace   where   road  pricing  could  occur   because   of   the\r\n\r\ndeteriorating traffic conditions on the CTE which is at  present\r\n\r\nthe only major expressway into the city not subject to ERP.   We\r\n\r\nhave  tried to delay it for as long as possible but the  traffic\r\n\r\nsituation  there  has  reached  a  stage  where  it  has  become\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  introduce  ERP on the  AYE  as  well.   LTA  will\r\n\r\nannounce  details of the gantry positions and the  rates  to  be\r\n\r\napplied for the ERP Phase II in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the problem on the CTE. It appears to be a\r\n\r\npeculiar  problem. It has generated interest  among  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  whose constituencies are in the north and north-east\r\n\r\nareas.   Mr  Chew Heng Ching, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Sin  Boon\r\n\r\nAnn  pointed out correctly that the ERP on the CTE alone is  not\r\n\r\nsolving  the  problem.  The LTA is aware of  the  problem.   The\r\n\r\ncongestion is caused by several factors.  Firstly, in the  early\r\n\r\nstages,  because  of the pricing that we introduced,  many  more\r\n\r\ntaxis  and  commercial vehicles made use of the CTE relative  to\r\n\r\nthe  number of private cars.  That was resolved last  year  when\r\n\r\nthe  ERP  rates  for  these  vehicles  were  raised.   This  has\r\n\r\nalleviated, but not solved the problem because there  are  other\r\n\r\nreasons for the congestion on the CTE.  It is an expressway with\r\n\r\nmany entrances and exits and serves very huge housing estates in\r\n\r\nthat  part of Singapore - Sembawang, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio and even\r\n\r\nTampines  and Pasir Ris.  These are all in the north and  north-east. CTE also links a number of major material roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that many motorists exit the CTE before the\r\n\r\nERP  gantry  point at Braddell and this causes a big tail  back.\r\n\r\nThe  exit  at Braddell Road is also a very congested and  narrow\r\n\r\nexit.  LTA will, first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof all, expand that CTE-Braddell Road interchange.  Tenders have\r\n\r\nbeen called this year, work is starting middle of this year  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  ready by the year 2002.  But Mr Yeo  Guat  Kwang  is\r\n\r\ncorrect to say that there has to be a whole series of solutions.\r\n\r\nIt  is not just one solution alone.  The longer-term solution is\r\n\r\nto  provide more public transport options for people  living  in\r\n\r\nnorth-east and this is where the north-east MRT line is going to\r\n\r\nbe  useful.  The north-east MRT line will be ready in 2002.   In\r\n\r\nthe meantime, before that is ready, before the CTE-Braddell Road\r\n\r\ninterchange is implemented, some other solutions will have to be\r\n\r\nfound  and  this  will  include increasing  ERP  rates  for  all\r\n\r\nvehicles and implementing additional ERP gantries along the CTE.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also suggested an additional expressway, which he\r\n\r\ncalled  the North East Expressway.  He will be pleased  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  there is indeed a plan for such an expressway in the long-term  transport  plan to serve the north east  area.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  will be two expressways.  One will be called the  Kallang\r\n\r\nExpressway and the other will be the Paya Lebar Expressway.  The\r\n\r\nKallang  Expressway will connect the East Coast Parkway  to  the\r\n\r\nPan-Island  Expressway.   So it will divert  traffic  down  this\r\n\r\nroute.  The Paya Lebar Expressway will be a continuation of  the\r\n\r\nKallang   Expressway  northwards  to  link  up   with   Tampines\r\n\r\nExpressway.  Alignments of these expressways are being finalised\r\n\r\nand are expected to be completed by 2006.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to a very interesting proposal by Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  on  ERP violations.  Yes, I agree that ERP violations  are\r\n\r\nmainly  due  to  forgetfulness or carelessness on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nmotorists.   I  do  not think anybody wants  to  cheat  the  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem.   In fact, they know that there is a very low chance  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  if  they want to do that, which is a testament  to  the\r\n\r\ntechnical integrity of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, when we had the ALS system, paper licence\r\n\r\nsystem, the fine for going through the gantry without displaying\r\n\r\na licence was $70.  We reduced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  ERP  composition fine to $30 in May last year.  Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nthinks that $30 is still too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the full implementation of ERP in September last\r\n\r\nyear,  the  number of cases has dropped from about  1,200  cases\r\n\r\ndaily  to  less than 800 cases a day now.  If you look at  these\r\n\r\n800  cases, this is something like 0.3% of the total  number  of\r\n\r\ntransactions we have every day going through the gantries.  More\r\n\r\nthan  99%  of motorists have no problem in ensuring  that  their\r\n\r\ncashcards  are properly inserted. I am sure that over time,  the\r\n\r\nhabit  of  inserting  cashcards into the IU before  beginning  a\r\n\r\njourney will be well formed.  But I do sympathise with the point\r\n\r\nof  view  of  Prof. Chin. If we can come up with a  fair  system\r\n\r\nwhich  does  not  take  up  too much  administrative  effort  or\r\n\r\nresource,  to allow motorists who forget to insert the  cashcard\r\n\r\nto   somehow  pay  for  the  outstanding  ERP  charge  plus   an\r\n\r\nadministrative  surcharge  -   I am glad he  mentioned  that   - then I think it is an idea worth looking at. I will ask the  LTA\r\n\r\nto look into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other option he suggested of having a monthly\r\n\r\nbilling  system, I am not so sure whether this will  be  a  very\r\n\r\npopular option.  We did discuss this when we first designed  the\r\n\r\nERP  system  and  we toyed with the option of having  a  monthly\r\n\r\nbilling  system  where  everybody gets a monthly  bill,  and  no\r\n\r\nworries  about inserting the cashcards or forgetting  and  being\r\n\r\nfined.  But we opted for the smartcard system because of several\r\n\r\nreasons.   First, we wanted to do away with this very  expensive\r\n\r\nand elaborate central accounting system, because this is what we\r\n\r\nneed  in order to keep track of all the 700,000 motorists  going\r\n\r\nthrough the gantries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this is an important point, we wanted to make\r\n\r\nmotorists aware and more conscious of the cost of motoring, that\r\n\r\nevery  time you pass through a gantry, you are aware that it  is\r\n\r\ncosting you something.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it helps us to move towards a cashless society by\r\n\r\nencouraging the use of smartcards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and this is not a trivial consideration, with a\r\n\r\nmonthly  billing system, privacy could be an issue if  motorists\r\n\r\nare  concerned  about  having details of their  movements  being\r\n\r\nrecorded.  According to some accounts, the main reason why  road\r\n\r\npricing  was rejected very early on in Hong Kong was because  of\r\n\r\nthe privacy consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the complexity of the system, we did not want, in the\r\n\r\ninitial stages, to complicate the system further.  But I do  not\r\n\r\nrule  out  the fact that as motorists become more aware  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem, as they become more used to it, as the system beds  down\r\n\r\nmore, we can consider introducing some of these refinements that\r\n\r\nProf. Chin suggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we have achieved a major milestone in\r\n\r\nland  transport policy when the ERP system successfully replaced\r\n\r\nthe  manual ALS and RPS systems last year.  Technically,  it  is\r\n\r\nworking to our satisfaction.  From the transport perspective, it\r\n\r\nis  achieving its purpose of spreading traffic and  keeping  our\r\n\r\nroads  free  flowing.  And, most importantly, 700,000 motorists,\r\n\r\nwho  have  IUs fitted, have become familiar with the system  and\r\n\r\nthe majority have no problems with the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our vehicle ownership and usage management\r\n\r\nmeasures may seem harsh at times, motorists understand that they\r\n\r\nare necessary if we are to keep our goods and people moving, our\r\n\r\neconomy  buzzing,  our  quality of life  improving.   These  two\r\n\r\ntraffic management tools must not be seen in isolation.  They go\r\n\r\nhand  in  hand.   The  3% per annum compound growth  in  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation for the next five years can only be sustained  -  and\r\n\r\nthis  is for Mr Iswaran's note  -  if we expand the ERP.  I hope\r\n\r\nthat motorists will not simply divert their trips from ERP roads\r\n\r\nor  ERP hours but seriously consider alternatives such as public\r\n\r\ntransport and car pooling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat is the rationale for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nallowing the bus transport companies to bid to operate the North\r\n\r\nEast Line when the SMRT is not.  The bus companies will have  to\r\n\r\nbring in foreign train operators to run this service.  Is  it  a\r\n\r\nkind  of  discrimination on SMRT?  And how are we so  sure  that\r\n\r\nSMRT  will  not be able to provide a better low-cost service  on\r\n\r\nrule-based competition compared with the foreign operators?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am urging the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider the setting up of a classic cars  category\r\n\r\nso that there will be a population of home grown older cars as a\r\n\r\nrecord  of  our  heritage.  Currently, there is  a  category  of\r\n\r\nvintage  cars.   These  are  cars  manufactured  prior  to  31st\r\n\r\nDecember 1939.  There are 92 such cars in Singapore, and most of\r\n\r\nthem  are  on special terms of restricted use to enjoy  a  lower\r\n\r\ncost  of  keeping them in Singapore.  Vintage cars on restricted\r\n\r\nuse  can  be  put  on our roads 28 days per calendar  year.   In\r\n\r\nreturn  for the restricted use, they are exempted from the  VQS,\r\n\r\nie,  owners  need not pay the PQP to retain their  registration.\r\n\r\nRoad  tax  is paid on a day basis to cover those days when  they\r\n\r\nare  on the road, and the fee to register a vintage car is  only\r\n\r\n$140.  But the car cannot be sold or transferred in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been much emphasis placed on\r\n\r\nreclaiming  our heritage.   Much effort and money are  allocated\r\n\r\nto  the conservation of buildings. Very often, when there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to showpiece the history of motoring in Singapore, members\r\n\r\nof  the vintage club are approached to participate and to parade\r\n\r\ntheir  cars.  Sadly, nothing is being done to enable  people  to\r\n\r\nretain  better  old cars.  In wanting to keep our population  of\r\n\r\ncars  young  and therefore relatively trouble free, we  overlook\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  people who maintain their  cars  in  excellent\r\n\r\ncondition.  Enthusiasts spend a lot of energy and money to  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  cars in pristine condition.  To quote an example, I refer\r\n\r\nto the 130 Minis owned by 135 members of the Mini Car Club.  All\r\n\r\nthe  Minis are in extremely good condition, their members having\r\n\r\nmade great effort to trace and import original parts to preserve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  Minis in almost as good as new condition.  It  is  merely\r\n\r\ntheir enthusiasm that keeps them going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose the establishment of a classic car\r\n\r\ncategory.   The definition should be based on age, and  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  an  age  of  40 years.  No car can  survive  that  long\r\n\r\nwithout proper care and attention.  Thus, there is no danger  of\r\n\r\nsuch cars breaking down frequently and causing congestion on our\r\n\r\nroads.   To  help  the enthusiasts with the cost of  maintaining\r\n\r\nsuch cars in good condition, I would like to suggest that for  a\r\n\r\nrestricted  use of 90 days per calendar year, they  be  exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  paying the PQP and the road tax be paid only for the  days\r\n\r\nof  use.  The registration fee should also be retained at  $140.\r\n\r\nThe  restricted  use for vintage cars should be revised  on  the\r\n\r\nsame basis as that for the classic cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as motoring is clearly an important subject for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  it  is right to allow the creation  of  a  living\r\n\r\nrecord  of  our  heritage  in  motoring.   As  in  our  historic\r\n\r\nbuildings,  before we lose more of our classic cars,  we  should\r\n\r\ntake immediate steps to preserve what is left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to give this proposal serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.   Only  the enthusiasts  and  people  willing  to\r\n\r\ninvest  time, effort and money would bother to keep  such  cars.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that there are sufficient measures such as the\r\n\r\nPQP  and  premium  on road tax payable in the initial  years  to\r\n\r\nensure  that only the better cars will be kept up to and  beyond\r\n\r\n40  years.   In  the hands of enthusiasts, these  cars  will  be\r\n\r\nbetter  maintained than a much younger car in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\naverage motorist.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we have clearly seen\r\n\r\na  marked  improvement to our public transport system  over  the\r\n\r\npast  decade.  Our people are now enjoying more comfortable  and\r\n\r\nconvenient  services.  Our bus services have  been  continuously\r\n\r\nimproved,  and the MRT network is expanding all the time.    The\r\n\r\n\"Star of Tomorrow\" - the LRT will be making its debut soon.

Between comfort and  shorter\r\n\r\ntravelling time, I think I will choose the latter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a random survey I conducted on our workers, I\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that they have to spend a lot of time  on  the  road\r\n\r\ngoing  to  and  returning  from  work.   Let  me  give  you   an\r\n\r\nillustration.  A worker who goes from Choa Chu Kang to Tuas will\r\n\r\nneed   about  1  hour and 30 minutes (including waiting/transfer\r\n\r\ntime).   From  Jurong East to Tuas, it takes  about  1  hour  20\r\n\r\nminutes.  For those who live in Yishun and if they want to go to\r\n\r\nAng Mo Kio Industrial Park, or for those who stay in Bedok going\r\n\r\nto  Loyang  or  Upper Changi Industrial Estate, they  will  need\r\n\r\nabout  an  hour  on  the road.  I hope that the  authority  will\r\n\r\nseriously explore more effective ways to shorten the time needed\r\n\r\nby our workers on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the welfare of our workers, I would again\r\n\r\nearnestly  urge  the  Ministry of Communications  to  build  MRT\r\n\r\nstations at industrial estates along the MRT lines, such as  the\r\n\r\nSungei Kadut Industrial Estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before I move on\r\n\r\nto  my  amendment, I would like to associate with the sentiments\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Gerard  Ee.

Having said that, let me say that there is  further\r\n\r\nroom  for  improvement.  I agree with Mr Yeo earlier.   We  must\r\n\r\ndevise  means and methods to shorten the time of travel on  bus.\r\n\r\nSir, I would urge the Minister to give consideration to one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narea, ie, perhaps the bus companies could work out a schedule so\r\n\r\nthat  passengers who are sitting in the office  could  find  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Internet what time a bus would reach its destination.\r\n\r\nIf we know this, Sir, it will save travelling time.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter is a more difficult issue, but I would\r\n\r\nurge the Minister to consider.  At the present moment, we have a\r\n\r\nduopoly, TIBS and Singapore Bus Service.  May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  give consideration to the possibility of having a third  bus\r\n\r\ncompany  or  a fourth bus company.  We know monopoly  is  not  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  sign and it will be good for Singapore in the long  run\r\n\r\nto have more bus companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which has not been explored is that we should\r\n\r\nhelp  the  public  transport.  To relieve  congestion  from  the\r\n\r\nroads,  cycling should be encouraged for short distance.   Going\r\n\r\nto  the  wet  market or buying something in the provision  shop,\r\n\r\neven  for  a short distance of half a kilometre, or two  hundred\r\n\r\nmetres,  people  still  go by car.  I see  my  good  friend,  Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman  Yusof  nodding his head.  I hope he  is  supporting  my\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  He is championing the cyclists' cause and  I  think\r\n\r\nit is healthy to cycle.  Many of us, when we were young, used to\r\n\r\ncycle  to  school.   I think that is not done  now.   We  should\r\n\r\nencourage cycling.  It is also a way to save the environment  as\r\n\r\nwell.   If  we  have  less  pollution, it  will  be  better  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It was reported in the Straits Times in  March\r\n\r\n1991  that the Woodlands MRT line was designed to make  it  easy\r\n\r\nfor the authorities to build an extension to Johor Baru.  It was\r\n\r\nalso further reported that the possibility of expanding the  MRT\r\n\r\nfrom  Woodlands  to Johor Baru was endorsed  and  agreed  to  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  by  Malaysian and Singapore Ministers  and  the  then\r\n\r\nJohor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.  The Woodlands MRT\r\n\r\nline  has  since been successfully constructed and has  been  in\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that bringing the MRT line into Johor\r\n\r\nBaru and beyond, say, to Scudai is a very good idea.  If not for\r\n\r\nanything else, this MRT line shall alleviate the traffic jams at\r\n\r\nthe  Johor-Singapore Causeway.  The traffic jams at the Causeway\r\n\r\nof  late  appear  to be on the Singapore side of  the  Causeway.\r\n\r\nLast  Saturday,  13th March, at about 4.30 pm, I personally  was\r\n\r\ncaught  in a nasty traffic jam for one-and-a-half hours  at  the\r\n\r\nstretch  of  road  from  the exit of the BKE  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration  Checkpoint.   I  noticed  that  at  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration Checkpoint, only about six or seven booths,  out  of\r\n\r\nabout  28,  were  in  operation.  What astounded  me  was  that,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  heavy traffic, the Singapore authorities  did  not\r\n\r\ndeploy  enough traffic police to direct the flow of traffic.   I\r\n\r\nsaw  only  two uniformed policemen were on duty at the point  of\r\n\r\nentry into the immigration area.  At that point of time, it  was\r\n\r\nutter  chaos  at  that  stretch  of  the  road  leading  to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Checkpoint.  Cars were vying with each other to inch\r\n\r\ntheir way forward.  Five rows of them were packed on the stretch\r\n\r\nof road which was only designed for four\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrows  of  cars at the most.  On top of that, there were hundreds\r\n\r\nof  motorcyclists weaving their way forward between cars and  in\r\n\r\nfull  throttle with each of the motorcycles emitting thick black\r\n\r\nsmoke.   The  atmosphere there was filled with black  fumes.   I\r\n\r\npity  those  two  policemen who were on duty there.   They  were\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  breathing the unhealthy air  filled  with  smoke.\r\n\r\nThey  were breathing without any protection.  Their health  will\r\n\r\nsurely be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do think that an MRT line going into Johor is a good\r\n\r\nthing.   It  not only helps to solve the constant traffic  jams,\r\n\r\nbut it shall surely increase the business between Johor Baru  on\r\n\r\nthe  one hand and the Woodlands Town Centre and Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  on the other.  It shall also bring the people of Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Singapore  closer  and  the relationship  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries can further be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there are steps\r\n\r\ntaken since 1991 to construct the MRT into Johor Baru.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe  last  one year or so, many Singaporeans who were retrenched\r\n\r\nor who were worried of being retrenched have been taking up taxi-driving for a living. Therefore, the taxi-driving profession has\r\n\r\nmany \"new talents\" coming in.  Many of them were former managers\r\n\r\nor  professionals.   These \"new talents\" are somewhat  different\r\n\r\nfrom the foreign talents that we were talking about the last few\r\n\r\ndays.   Although  the  entry  of  these  newcomers  has  created\r\n\r\ncompetition  against the old-timers, our existing  taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nsympathise  with  them because they understand  that  these  ex-managers  and  ex-professionals too need to  earn  a  living  to\r\n\r\nsupport  their families.  On the other hand, the commuters   are\r\n\r\nhappy  because  there  are  now more taxis  available  to  them.\r\n\r\nTalking  about  foreign talents, our taxi drivers  do  sincerely\r\n\r\nwelcome  them to Singapore, because most of these foreigners  do\r\n\r\nnot  drive  and  they take taxi all the time,  giving  our  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers more business.  With more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers available, it also resolves the previous problem of\r\n\r\nmatching taxis with drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing we need to improve upon. This is the\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  taxi  service industry is  undergoing  a  major\r\n\r\nreform.   We should take away some of the old regulations  which\r\n\r\nare  becoming obsolete by now, so that our taxi drivers can also\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  our  move  towards  a  world-class   public\r\n\r\ntransport system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing rule requires every taxi driver to undergo a\r\n\r\nrefresher course once in every 10 years.  I think this ought  to\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed now.  The taxi service industry  is moving  towards\r\n\r\nmore  high-tech operations, such as computer-aided  distribution\r\n\r\nof  service, satellite calls, etc.  Taking a course once in  ten\r\n\r\nyears  cannot keep the drivers abreast of the latest technology.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  taking a refresher course once in 10 years means  the\r\n\r\ndriver will have to go for courses five nights in a row.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  inconvenient to the taxi drivers.  Perhaps, we could  have\r\n\r\nit  once every five years for two nights in a row, or maybe once\r\n\r\nevery  two  years  for a one-night course.  I think  this  taxi-driver  refresher  course should be  treated   as  part  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Lifelong Learning Scheme\"  so that taxi drivers can enjoy  some\r\n\r\nsort of subsidies.  At present, they have to pay the full course\r\n\r\nfees  on  their  own.   I feel that our taxi drivers  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to take up the various training courses like the  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Actually, in driving a taxi, you have to use your\r\n\r\nbrain  too.   You  have  to  map out the  route  which  is  less\r\n\r\ncongested  and  drive your passenger to his destination  in  the\r\n\r\nshortest  possible time.  As a matter of fact, the taxi  service\r\n\r\nindustry is one of the first industries to be computerised.   It\r\n\r\nis  the philosophy of the taxi drivers that with the combination\r\n\r\nof  the  \"electronic brain\" (Chinese expression for \"computer\"),\r\n\r\nand  the  human  brain, we can provide better services  for  our\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I urge hon.

Most of  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  tend to centre around the crowded buses during  peak\r\n\r\nhours.   But  what  prompted me to speak  on  this  cut  is  the\r\n\r\nperceived  poor  responsiveness of the system  with  respect  to\r\n\r\npopulation   shift,  especially  when  new  HDB  precincts   are\r\n\r\ncompleted  and the population moves in.  I am not  referring  to\r\n\r\nnew town development but precinct development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me relate my experience in Toh Guan Estate in my\r\n\r\nconstituency.   In that particular estate, about 5,000  families\r\n\r\nhave  moved into the 30-plus HDB blocks.  During my house  visit\r\n\r\nin   August  last  year,  almost  every  family  in  that  block\r\n\r\ncomplained  about the lack of transportation service from  their\r\n\r\nhome to the nearest market.  After that, during the block party,\r\n\r\nmore  than 100 housewives surrounded me and said, \"We have  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\"   Experienced though I am, as an MP, I think  any  one\r\n\r\nwho  is  faced with 100 angry housewives would find it difficult\r\n\r\nto handle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I brought up the issue with SBS, it came back with\r\n\r\na  very  polite reply, saying, \"There is no problem.   Residents\r\n\r\ncan  take  this  bus,  that way.  They can change  bus  at  that\r\n\r\nlocation  to  get to their market.\"  When I brought  up  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council (PTC), PTC came back with a very polite\r\n\r\nreply,  again, saying, \"All the established standards have  been\r\n\r\nmet and residents will have no problem taking the bus from where\r\n\r\nthey want to go to where they are.\"  Finally, after a lot of to-ing  and fro-ing, I am grateful to report that a new bus service\r\n\r\nhas  finally  been introduced on 7th March this  year.   What  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  do  here  is to urge the  Minister  to,  maybe,\r\n\r\ncommunicate  with  the  PTC  to  establish  a  new  standard  to\r\n\r\nanticipate  new  demands rather than the Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nbringing  up the problems and then the system responds to  these\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  speak  on  what would appear to be  a  small  matter,\r\n\r\nsomething concerning a difference of 30 cents only.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that most of our NUS students use public\r\n\r\ntransport  to get to their campus, in particular, many  of  them\r\n\r\nuse SBS bus service No. 96 from Clementi Bus Interchange to Kent\r\n\r\nRidge.   Whether it is an air-conditioned service  or  not,  the\r\n\r\nminimum charge is 60 cents.  Many students feel that the fare of\r\n\r\n60  cents   is  very  expensive  and  unreasonable  because  the\r\n\r\ndistance  is  so  short.  They are  asking for the  fare  to  be\r\n\r\nreduced to 30 cents, as in the feeder service.  Although  it  is\r\n\r\njust a difference of 30 cents, to the NUS students 30 cents  per\r\n\r\ntrip, when accumulated, can mean  a lot of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have made representation to SBS, but the company had\r\n\r\nturned  them  down  and the explanation given  is  unconvincing.\r\n\r\nSBS's justification for sticking to the 60-cent minimum fare  is\r\n\r\nthat bus service No. 96 is operated from Buona Vista Interchange\r\n\r\nand  not a loop service from Clementi Interchange to Kent Ridge.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it is not a feeder service.  It cannot qualify as a\r\n\r\nfeeder bus service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic crisis, the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nhas  already frozen the incremental university tuition fees.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Ministry of Communications would take up  the  matter\r\n\r\nwith SBS so as not to give our NUS students the feeling that SBS\r\n\r\nis  operating  on a monopoly and any hope of fare  reduction  is\r\n\r\nout of the question!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have more or\r\n\r\nless the same issue as Mr Peh and, that is, the issue of whether\r\n\r\nderegulation  of bus services would indeed lower  the  costs  to\r\n\r\ncommuters and also encourage enterpreneurship as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, there are two bus operators, SBS and\r\n\r\nTIBS,  together with some Scheme B operators and private shuttle\r\n\r\nservices.   But  as far as I understand, there  are  no  private\r\n\r\noperators running services along trunk routes or along  selected\r\n\r\nroutes which are not feeder services.  It would seem to me  that\r\n\r\nselective allowance of private operators would improve  services\r\n\r\nto commuters without severely affecting the profitability of the\r\n\r\npresent bus companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI am aware that bus companies use the profitable routes, such as\r\n\r\nthe  trunk  services,  to cross-subsidise  unprofitable  routes.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  not  convinced that  deregulation  of  selected\r\n\r\nservices  would,  in  effect, result  in  a  loss  of  financial\r\n\r\nviability of the two major bus companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A service precisely in point is the one from the Clementi\r\n\r\nInterchange  to  the NUS campus that Mr Peh talked  about.   One\r\n\r\nspecific  suggestion I have is to open up  the  route  from  the\r\n\r\nClementi Interchange to the NUS campus at Kent Ridge to  private\r\n\r\noperators and see whether this would indeed result in a fall  in\r\n\r\nbus fares and an improvement in service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification regarding the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement that the longer term plan is  to  have  at\r\n\r\nleast  two  main  operators running both  rail  and  bus  lines,\r\n\r\ntogether  with several smaller bus operators, and  whether  this\r\n\r\nplan in effect means a deregulation of bus services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the present bus structure is such\r\n\r\nthat  the minimum one passenger pays for four fare stages is  60\r\n\r\ncents.  But I urge the Minister to reconsider the position.   We\r\n\r\nshould possibly allow two or three fare stages for 40 cents  and\r\n\r\nthen  go  up  gradually.  Now, it is actually 60 cents  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  four fare stages and another four fare stages.  Could  we\r\n\r\nhave  two  fare stages at one fare and then the other  two  fare\r\n\r\nstages?   So  it  would  be equitable and  fair.   I  share  the\r\n\r\nsentiments of both my colleagues, Dr Lee and Mr Peh.  It is most\r\n\r\nunfair  to travel a short distance and pay so much.  Why  do  we\r\n\r\nnot  follow telephone usage?  The longer you use, the  more  you\r\n\r\npay.  It is only fair and equitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the interest of time, I will give\r\n\r\na  very  brief  response  to an issue  which,  I  think,  really\r\n\r\nrequires  much  more time. This is the issue of  multi-modality.\r\n\r\nBoth Dr Lee and Mr Chay Wai Chuen touched on this issue in their\r\n\r\nquestions.  The  purpose of this move towards multi-modality  is\r\n\r\nreally  to improve the overall public transport system.   I  use\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"public transport system\" because, right  now,  what\r\n\r\nhappens is that we have operators that run buses and we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperators  that run trains.  We do not have operators  that  run\r\n\r\nboth.   This is really not ideal from the point of view  of  the\r\n\r\ncommuting  public.  And, indeed, neither is it sustainable  from\r\n\r\nthe point of  view of the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will recall, as we extend our rail network, what\r\n\r\nhappens  is  that the buses will lose their market  share.  Over\r\n\r\ntime,  as  we envisage a more extensive rail network, the  buses\r\n\r\nwill  gradually  lose  more  and more  of  their  market  share.\r\n\r\nEventually, what we are going to see, if we do not do  anything,\r\n\r\nis  that  the  bus operators will lose their ability  to  cross-subsidise.  In fact, there is a lot of cross-subsidisation  that\r\n\r\ngoes  on  within  the system.  But if all the major  routes  are\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by  trains, the bus companies will lose  their  so-called   lucrative  services,  the  cream  of  their   services.\r\n\r\nEventually, the ability to provide those services which  Mr  Rai\r\n\r\nand Dr Lee talked about and which are losing money, that ability\r\n\r\nto  cross-subsidise will be gone.  So that is another reason why\r\n\r\nwe are moving towards this system of multi-modal environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this environment, buses and trains will be operated by a\r\n\r\nsingle    operator.    There   will   be   better   integration,\r\n\r\nsynchronisation of timing, and, hopefully, integration will also\r\n\r\nlead  to better fare systems.  These changes in the fare systems\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  talking about today can be looked at  in  a  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move towards this structure, the first step is that we\r\n\r\nhave invited SBS and TIBS, who are both bus operators, to tender\r\n\r\nfor  the  operation of the North-East MRT Line as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nPunggol  and  Sengkang LRTs.  This is not to  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nSMRT,  as Mr Chay asked just now, is not doing a good  job.   On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, it is doing a good job.  However, we  are  taking\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to look at a new structure for the industry and\r\n\r\ntaking this opportunity, with the advent of the North-East Line,\r\n\r\nto encourage bus operators to go into train operations. And vice\r\n\r\nversa because we will also be encouraging the train operator  to\r\n\r\ndo likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a step towards deregulation? This will allow us to\r\n\r\nderegulate because once we have a multi-modal environment and we\r\n\r\nhave  two or more multi-modal operators, I envisage that we will\r\n\r\nalso  have  room  to accommodate smaller single mode  operators,\r\n\r\nessentially   bus  operators.   We  already  have  private   bus\r\n\r\noperators.   Scheme B operators are already covering  or  plying\r\n\r\nsome  of  the routes.  But they are not sufficient to give  that\r\n\r\ncompetitive push to the major operators.  I recognise that.  And\r\n\r\nin  this multi-modal environment, I hope that we will be able to\r\n\r\nfurther  deregulate bus routes and allow more direct competition\r\n\r\namongst single mode bus operators and multi-mode operators.  But\r\n\r\nthis  has to be done in a managed and sustainable manner and  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  be  reviewing  the  regulatory  and   licensing\r\n\r\nframework to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Minister of State and Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto answer the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun):</b> Sir, Mr Yeo, Mr Rai and Dr Wang commented positively on\r\n\r\nthe development of our public transport industry.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthey  asked  that we continue to improve and shorten the  travel\r\n\r\ntime.  Let me say that, in fact, there are a few things that  we\r\n\r\nare  doing  to improve public transport.  Firstly, the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas mentioned about the public transport industry restructuring,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  started.  That will bring in more  competition.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the Minister has also announced that LTA is embarking\r\n\r\non  a  comprehensive development of rail systems.  If we have  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive rail network, it will help to reduce  travel  time\r\n\r\nas  we  rely  more on rail and less on bus services  which  have\r\n\r\nlimitations due to routing and traffic jams. Thirdly, we will do\r\n\r\nall  we can in using technology to improve the services for  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters.  One good example suggested by Mr Rai is to have  the\r\n\r\nbus  schedule  and  bus arrival times to be  made  available  to\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor his information, LTA is currently developing a system called\r\n\r\nthe Travel Information System (TIS).  LTA will work with the bus\r\n\r\noperators  and  use  satellites, GPS,  and  so  on  to  estimate\r\n\r\naccurately  bus  arrival times at every  bus  stop  and  we  can\r\n\r\ndisplay  them at bus stops and over the Internet as  well.   All\r\n\r\nthese will work towards improving the bus services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also answer the question by Dr Wang Kai Yuen about\r\n\r\nwhether PTC can be more responsive to the needs of residents for\r\n\r\nbus  services in new towns.  Let me inform him that  before  the\r\n\r\npeople move into a new town, the bus operators, LTA, HDB and JTC\r\n\r\nwill  come together and draw up a conceptual plan for the  town.\r\n\r\nThese  plans  will  have  to be approved  by  PTC  and,  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  the services will be such that it will  cater  to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  population in the town.  But as the town  develops  and\r\n\r\nmore  and more people move into the town, the bus operators  and\r\n\r\nPTC  will  monitor the transport needs very closely and  upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  bus  services accordingly. That is why as  the  Member  has\r\n\r\npointed  out that on 7th March, a new bus service was introduced\r\n\r\nin  the  Toh  Guan Estate.  That was because of this  procedure.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  ask  PTC to see whether we  can  improve  on  the\r\n\r\nresponsiveness and whether we can provide bus services  earlier.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, in the beginning, because the population is  small,\r\n\r\nthere  will be some inconveniences and you cannot introduce  bus\r\n\r\nservices  in very fine increments and so there is this  problem.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I  will ask PTC to see whether  we  can  be  more\r\n\r\nresponsive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh talked about bus service No. 96 from Clementi\r\n\r\nInterchange  to NUS and asked whether it could be changed  to  a\r\n\r\nfeeder bus service and reduce its fare to 30 cents.  Feeder  bus\r\n\r\nservices  are generally for travel within the town and  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  definition  that the bus company and  PTC  agreed  to  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  this  service, as Mr Peh has  pointed  out,  is  not\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  a  feeder  service.  We should  not  arbitrarily\r\n\r\nconvert trunk buses to feeder buses because feeder services  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  not viable and heavily subsidised by other commuters.\r\n\r\nIf we change that, there are many other short distance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservices  that can also be changed to feeder service,  and  that\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  serious  impact  on  the  viability  of  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.  NUS students who use buses frequently could consider\r\n\r\npurchasing  concession bus stamps, which offer unlimited  travel\r\n\r\nof  SBS and TIBS buses for a monthly fee of $44 to $50, and they\r\n\r\ncan  travel as much as they want on all the trunk and feeder bus\r\n\r\nservices.  And to help the commuting public during the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis, the transport operators have offered a 5% rebate for all\r\n\r\nfarecard top-ups and concession bus stamps are also given  a  5%\r\n\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to answer Mr Rai's point about distance-based\r\n\r\nfares.   Yes,  in  fact,  we are moving  towards  distance-based\r\n\r\nfares,  but  the bus fare structure is based on two  components.\r\n\r\nOne is the upfront component and the other is the distance-based\r\n\r\ncomponent.  The reason why we need to have an upfront  component\r\n\r\nis because whether you travel a long or short distance, there is\r\n\r\na  certain  amount  of overheads bus companies  have  to  incur.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is unreasonable to ask the bus companies to charge\r\n\r\nvery  small  bus  fares  for a very short distance  because  the\r\n\r\noverheads incurred are much more than that.  That is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have these two components.  For longer distance travel,\r\n\r\nwe  have increased the number of fare bands from 5 to 7 and that\r\n\r\nis in line with Mr Rai's suggestion of a distance-based concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  (Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):  Sir, on classic  cars,  we\r\n\r\ntake  note of the request but we will address it in view of  our\r\n\r\ngreater  emphasis on usage rather than ownership  measures.   On\r\n\r\ntaxi-driver's refresher course by Mr Seng Han Thong, I will  ask\r\n\r\nLTA to study how we can incorporate some of his suggestions.  On\r\n\r\nthe question by Mr Chiam, it was a suggestion by Malaysia but we\r\n\r\nhave  not received any formal proposal.  Hence there is  nothing\r\n\r\non the table yet for us to discuss.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  all  his answers to our queries and I beg leave to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $325,505,650 for Head I ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,776,515,900 for Head I ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head M -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head M - Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\nAmendment No. (1), Mr Heng Chiang Meng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me thank the Minister for the amendments to\r\n\r\nthe   Environmental  Public  Health  Act  relating  to   heavier\r\n\r\npenalties  for  illegal dumping.  The Bill  is  due  for  second\r\n\r\nreading  later this week and I am very sure that we will welcome\r\n\r\nthe enactment of heavier penalties for illegal dumping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal dumping is not only against the law but also a\r\n\r\ncrime  against  the  community  and  environment.   Such  crimes\r\n\r\nagainst the environment sometimes may have long-lasting effects,\r\n\r\nespecially when the wastes illegally dumped contain toxic matter\r\n\r\nand/or  heavy  matter.  As a community, we must  never  tolerate\r\n\r\nillegal  dumping.   We should not take this  as  a  small  petty\r\n\r\noffence.  However, for the law to be effective, the perpetrators\r\n\r\nof  these  illegal  acts  must  be caught.   Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities cannot be in all places at all times to catch  these\r\n\r\noffenders.   The authorities need the help of the  community  to\r\n\r\ncatch these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  look into some form of empowerment to be  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  community to assist them catch these offenders.  Right now,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  have any concrete ideas of what type of  empowerment\r\n\r\nwould  be  needed.  Certainly, I do not propose  empowering  our\r\n\r\naverage Singaporeans to personally confront these offenders.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  just too risky to do so.  All I am suggesting at  this\r\n\r\npoint  is  for  the concept to be studied and accepted,  and  if\r\n\r\nneeded, I will be most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npleased to help contribute concrete ideas on the form that  such\r\n\r\nempowerment should take.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, illegal\r\n\r\ndumping  of  construction  and other waste  materials  has  been\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  reported  in  the local newspapers  recently.   This\r\n\r\ntakes  place  in vacant lands near residential housing  estates,\r\n\r\nlorry  parks or any places where illegal dumping could  be  done\r\n\r\nwithout being caught.  I observe that there are mainly two types\r\n\r\nof  dumping behaviour. One is the small-timer who just wants  to\r\n\r\nsave  some  money by not disposing their waste at  the  official\r\n\r\ndumping  ground and indiscriminately disposing their  wastes  as\r\n\r\nand  when  it  is  available.  Usually, the truck  drivers  just\r\n\r\nunload  the  wastes and they carry it to any vacant  land  where\r\n\r\nthey could be undetected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type, I think, is more important and deserves\r\n\r\nsome  attention.  There are illegal dumpings which  are  planned\r\n\r\nand  well-organised.  They could be operating as  illegal  waste\r\n\r\ncollectors  and  landfill  operators for  significant  financial\r\n\r\ngains.  One example where this could happen is when a company or\r\n\r\nindividual tenders for a piece of land which is of low lying and\r\n\r\ncan  be used for agricultural purposes, and the operator can use\r\n\r\nthe  premises  as an illegal landfill and for the collection  of\r\n\r\nconstruction wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is that a company can disguise itself as\r\n\r\na town council or private estate conservancy contractor and make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the rubbish bin centres and facilities provided by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment for illegal disposal of their wastes\r\n\r\ncollected   either   from  a  commercial  or  industrial   waste\r\n\r\ncollection service.  In other words, the company is making money\r\n\r\nfrom  the collection of wastes from other places and the  people\r\n\r\nliving  in  housing estates and the Ministry of the  Environment\r\n\r\nare made to bear the cost of the final disposal of the wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irresponsible waste disposal will cost much more money for\r\n\r\nthe people who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsequently have to put in the effort to clear the mess created\r\n\r\nby such illegal dumping.  In the illegal landfill situation, the\r\n\r\nproblem resulting from illegal landfill could cause pollution to\r\n\r\nour  water  resources. As the Chairman of the GPC has mentioned,\r\n\r\nsometimes, illegal dumpings of wastes contain traces of toxic or\r\n\r\nhazardous  material  and it could cause our environment  greater\r\n\r\nand, long-term damage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many such illegal\r\n\r\ndumpings  have been detected in the past one year.  For  illegal\r\n\r\nlandfill activities, like the one I have described  where it  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out in certain low-lying areas which could be used  for\r\n\r\nagricultural purposes, what would the Ministry do in controlling\r\n\r\nsuch  unauthorised landfill activities?  Under the current  law,\r\n\r\nin  what ways could such an environmental culprit be effectively\r\n\r\ndealt with?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Several countries in the region had\r\n\r\nbeen  hit  by  very  unusual food-related diseases.   A  notable\r\n\r\nexample in the past few years were:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in 1996, an outbreak of food poisoning in Japan caused\r\n\r\nby  E-coli resulted in about 9,000 cases and 12 deaths.   School\r\n\r\nchildren  were also implicated and schools had to be closed  and\r\n\r\ndisinfected to contain the outbreak;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) in 1997, Hong Kong had the chicken flu. 18 persons\r\n\r\nwere  infected  and  6  of them died.  To  break  the  chain  of\r\n\r\ntransmission, the authorities had to destroy about  1.5  million\r\n\r\nchicks;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) in 1998, the fish farming industry in Hong Kong was\r\n\r\nhit by the algae bloom known as red tide.  About 1,500 tonnes of\r\n\r\ntoxic farm fish had to be destroyed;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) currently, Malaysian pigs have been hit by a virus\r\n\r\noutbreak  known  as Japanese encephalitis.  At least,  34  human\r\n\r\ndeaths have been attributed to infection by this virus since the\r\n\r\noutbreak last October;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) only yesterday, I read a newspaper report about the use\r\n\r\nof growth stimulants\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  pigs  in Malaysia.  According to the report, the residue  of\r\n\r\nstimulants  used could damage the health of consumers.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nit  is worth reading a part from the report.  I quote, \"We  want\r\n\r\nto  tell  the  world our experience with pigs, fed  with  growth\r\n\r\nstimulants.   We  can distinguish pigs fed with  such  chemicals\r\n\r\nfrom the deformed reproductive organs of the female pigs. We can\r\n\r\nimagine  the  harm  it  could  do to  humans  who  consume  pork\r\n\r\ncontaminated with growth stimulants.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, sometime ago, there was a spectre of the mad-cow\r\n\r\ndisease  in  the United Kingdom.  The funny thing is that  these\r\n\r\nviruses affecting cows and chickens were not supposed to  affect\r\n\r\nhumans. But, somehow, some form, perhaps mutated because of  the\r\n\r\ndrugs  and chemicals given to the animals, had managed  to  jump\r\n\r\nthe  inter-specie  gap.   It  is enough  to  make  a  person  go\r\n\r\nvegetarian.  But even so, it may not be of much help seeing  the\r\n\r\nE-coli  outbreak  was  partly caused by contamination  in  white\r\n\r\nradish  sprouts,  a  vegetable.   Also,  what  new  diseases  or\r\n\r\noutbreaks the introduction of laboratory altered genes into  our\r\n\r\nfood would generate is beyond anybody's guess at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions to the Minister are these: What is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  on these issues?  If  outbreaks  occur  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are  we  truly prepared for  them?   Should  we  not\r\n\r\nlegislate  for the labelling of genetically altered food?   With\r\n\r\nlabelling, at least the consumers have a choice.  To  take  this\r\n\r\npoint   further,  should  we  even  stop  the  import  of   such\r\n\r\ngenetically  altered food?  Would the Ministry  promote  an  on-going programme to educate the public on these matters?\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I endorse the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  measures  to  assess the hygiene  standard  of  food\r\n\r\nstalls.  But many hawkers are unhappy with the grading criteria.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Ministry of the  Environment  should  review  the\r\n\r\ncriteria  so  that  we can reach a standard acceptable  by  both\r\n\r\nhawkers and the consumers, as well as the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I observe that not many stalls are graded A or\r\n\r\nB.   Under  the   present grading system, not only  the  hygiene\r\n\r\naspect  is considered, but the  display of food, attire  of  the\r\n\r\nhawkers,  general  cleanliness of the stall,  layout  and  other\r\n\r\nfactors  are  also taken into consideration.  If we compare  the\r\n\r\nhawker   stalls  with  fast  food  outlets,  restaurants,   air-conditioned  food courts, we find that it is unfair  and  biased\r\n\r\nagainst   the   poor  hawkers.   Because  of  their   favourable\r\n\r\nconditions,  the operators  of fast-food outlets and  food-court\r\n\r\nstalls are in a better position to secure A or B grades from the\r\n\r\nauthority.   But to the neighbourhood hawker stalls, to get A or\r\n\r\nB  grades   is not so easy.  It is unfair.  Unlike the fast-food\r\n\r\nchain  or  restaurants, these hawker stalls   do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  backing,  neither  do  they  have  the  advantage  of\r\n\r\nadvanced technology  to help them with their chores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the hawkers have to do everything by themselves,\r\n\r\nfrom  dawn  to dusk.  They are the bosses as well as the  cooks.\r\n\r\nThey  have to serve the customers as well as to wash the  dishes\r\n\r\nand clean the stall.  So if you want the ordinary hawkers to  do\r\n\r\neverything to qualify for a A grade, it is almost impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell Members about the Whampoa Hawker Centre, a\r\n\r\nhawker centre in my Constituency, which is generally regarded as\r\n\r\none  of  the  best in Singapore. During  my visit to the  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre, I found a lot of people queuing up in front of a certain\r\n\r\nstall  which  was  graded C.  The stall has  attracted  a  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  patrons.  It enjoys the best business in  the  whole\r\n\r\nhawker  centre.   I discussed this phenomenon with my grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders and they told me that business is so good for this stall\r\n\r\nthat  the stallholder simply cannot find time to keep his  stall\r\n\r\nin  the conditions favoured by the Environment officials.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  way he is going to earn himself a A or B grade.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  those stalls where business is not  so  good,  the\r\n\r\nstallholders  have a lot of time to clean up and dress up  their\r\n\r\nstalls to the delight of the officials, and they get their Grade\r\n\r\nA certificates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grassroots leaders told me that this is an irony. When\r\n\r\nthe customers come to the hawker centre, they look at the stalls\r\n\r\nwhich  are graded C.  Their business is so good that   there  is\r\n\r\nalways  a long queue.  The logical conclusion is  that the  food\r\n\r\nat these stalls  must be good.  But when you look at the A-grade\r\n\r\nstalls,  there  is  no queue and, therefore, the  food  must  be\r\n\r\nlousy.  Do  not  buy  from them.  Do not patronise  them.   This\r\n\r\ndefeats the whole purpose of the grading exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even puzzling to note that the stall at Block 90, #01-171, which was recently adjudged by the Town Council as the\r\n\r\ncleanest  hawker  stall in Whampoa Drive Food Centre,  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  only  a  C  grade  by the Ministry  of  the  Environment.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I do not know how the Ministry officials derive at  the\r\n\r\nA, B or C grading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also visited the hawker centres in Queenstown, Bukit\r\n\r\nHo  Swee  and  some  other places.  I observe that  some  hawker\r\n\r\nstalls  which  are  very dirty are awarded B grade,  while  some\r\n\r\nstalls  which are cleaner get only the C grade.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nhow the standard is fixed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of the Environment can look into this\r\n\r\nquestion  and see whether we can do away with the  A,  B  and  C\r\n\r\ngrades.   Since A, B and C are  all \"pass\" grades, a P grade  is\r\n\r\ngood  enough.   For those who do not make the pass  grade,  just\r\n\r\ngive  them a \"F\" for failure.   The customers would know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Ministry of the Environment can look into\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, last year, we were spared the\r\n\r\nhaze  of previous years, not because the problems at source were\r\n\r\nresolved  but because of two factors.  The first was the  effect\r\n\r\nof  La  Nina, which accounted for a very wet period during  what\r\n\r\notherwise would be a dry season.  The other was that large-scale\r\n\r\nburning  of  forested  land by plantation owners  did  not  take\r\n\r\nplace, not because they realise that it was criminal to burn the\r\n\r\nforest, but because they were not investing in new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplanting areas.  We certainly cannot depend on these two factors\r\n\r\nfor the prevention of future occurrences of the haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister could tell the House what steps have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  to prevent future occurrences.  Are the Indonesians\r\n\r\ncooperating  on  this  issue?  Have we  been  able  to  rope  in\r\n\r\ninternational agencies and non-Government organisations to  help\r\n\r\nIndonesia, Malaysia and ourselves to tackle this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, like Mr Heng, I\r\n\r\nam speaking about the haze.  It is clearly a problem that is not\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore's  exclusive control.  This  demonstrates  the\r\n\r\ninterdependence of the environment.  This also becomes a  larger\r\n\r\nproblem because our neighbour, Indonesia, is implicated in this.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  has gone for now.  The skies are  blue.   But  the\r\n\r\nroots of the problem remain.  And as indicated by the return  of\r\n\r\nthe  fires at the end of November/December, the problem at  root\r\n\r\nis  still  there.  This  problem at root is  the  incapacity  or\r\n\r\nunwillingness  to enforce laws made by Indonesia  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nIt  is  tied  not  just  to  the air  but  to  forestry  and  to\r\n\r\nagriculture, and to the profit motive that those who  clear  the\r\n\r\nland  for  forestry or agriculture save money by using fire  and\r\n\r\nthis,  of  course,  is  tied  up  to  the  problem  of  KKN    - corruption,  cronyism  and nepotism in Indonesia.   And  it  may\r\n\r\nindeed worsen given the lack of controls in Indonesia today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to advise the House on how we are\r\n\r\nworking with the Indonesian authorities to-date, and how we  are\r\n\r\nengaging  the  Indonesian government to give attention  to  this\r\n\r\nproblem; even today, given the other challenges Indonesia faces.\r\n\r\nI  would ask the Minister particularly to consider that we  need\r\n\r\nto  work with whatever and whoever rises in Indonesia after  the\r\n\r\ncoming elections.  Whoever they may be, we should work with them\r\n\r\nas  long  as  they are genuine in the desire for change  and  to\r\n\r\ntackle the challenge of the haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I think that we should do more to hold\r\n\r\nresponsible  those  who  are indeed  guilty  and  relentless  in\r\n\r\nflouting  the  Indonesian  laws.   More  specifically,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Minister that in the coming  year,  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work to strengthen ASEAN as well as to  work  with\r\n\r\ninternational  agencies.  By these, I do not  mean  just  United\r\n\r\nNations  Environment Programme we have worked with  before,  but\r\n\r\nalso  the  World Bank and the IMF to tie together the change  in\r\n\r\nthe  economics  of  Indonesia together with the  environment  to\r\n\r\ngenuinely search for sustainable development.  Otherwise, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  will  see the return of the fires with  the  economic\r\n\r\nchanges and the environmental changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disaster is not just for Singaporeans or\r\n\r\nMalaysians affected by the haze.  This has been disaster for the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  themselves.  It is moreover not a natural  disaster,\r\n\r\nbut a man-made one.  Disasters can spur action to prevent future\r\n\r\nrecurrence.  Or when the skies are clear, we and our  neighbours\r\n\r\nmay  forget.  I therefore ask the Minister to look to  the  long\r\n\r\nterm and to continue and indeed strengthen and widen our efforts\r\n\r\nin this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I am speaking on the topic\r\n\r\nof diesel vehicle pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the diesel technology has advanced, and all well-maintained diesel vehicles should not emit any visible diesel\r\n\r\nsmoke  from the exhaust.  Every now and then, when we travel  on\r\n\r\nour  roads, smoky exhausts from lorries could be easily spotted.\r\n\r\nIf one is a bit more observant, he should be able to spot one or\r\n\r\ntwo  of such cases on every trip when he goes to work.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister whether we have relaxed the  vehicle\r\n\r\nemission  standard for diesel smoke in this period  of  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, the oil companies announced an increase in the\r\n\r\ndiesel price.  The reason given was that the sulphur content  in\r\n\r\nthe  diesel had been further reduced.  I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  is  the  impact  on  the  improvement   in   the\r\n\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  the  sulphur content in the diesel fuel is reduced.   Does\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in the diesel price add any burden to  the  fleet\r\n\r\noperators during this economic downturn?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many diesel engine technologies aimed at the\r\n\r\npost-treatment   of  the  diesel  engine  exhausts   to   reduce\r\n\r\npollution.  This includes the diesel particulate traps  and  the\r\n\r\ndiesel catalytic converter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrol car owner has been asked to compulsorily install\r\n\r\nthe  3-way  catalytic converter and also use unleaded petrol  in\r\n\r\nlowering  exhaust pollutants.  However, diesel  cars  and  truck\r\n\r\nowners  are  quite  favourably  treated  by  the  Ministry   for\r\n\r\ncontinuing to emit the much higher level of pollutants into  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.   In  view of the available technology,  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider  a stricter emission  standard  for  diesel\r\n\r\nvehicles,  like  the implementation of the compulsory  catalytic\r\n\r\nconverter  and diesel particulate trap for all newly  registered\r\n\r\ndiesel vehicles in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my\r\n\r\nviews on the detection of black smoke from vehicles is different\r\n\r\nfrom  my  other colleagues.  First, I would like to  declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest  as  the Executive Secretary of the National  Transport\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union and Adviser to three taxi operator associations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to the notice of the House the\r\n\r\nunhappiness  of many drivers of diesel vehicles with  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe penalties for emission of black smoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, vehicles which emitted black smoke with\r\n\r\nHartridge Smoke Unit (HSU) reading of 84 and below, the fine was\r\n\r\n$150  each for the driver and the owner.  Since 1st August 1998,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  the Environment has revised the  penalty  for\r\n\r\nblack  smoke  emission.  The current penalty for offenders  with\r\n\r\nHSU reading of 84 and below is $150 for the driver and the owner\r\n\r\nin the case of a first offender.  For repeat offender within two\r\n\r\nyears,  the  driver and owner have to face fines of  $500  each.\r\n\r\nFor HSU reading of 85 and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabove, the fine for a first offender is $300 each for the driver\r\n\r\nand owner, and $500 each for a repeat offender within two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big amount to the taxi drivers. They feel that\r\n\r\nsuch  a penalty is too stiff.  They have remarked that the fines\r\n\r\nfor speeding and other traffic offences which may result in loss\r\n\r\nof  lives are not as severe as the penalty for emission of black\r\n\r\nsmoke.  Why is the penalty for such an offence more severe  than\r\n\r\nthe other life-threatening traffic offences?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, they feel that poisonous gases such as\r\n\r\nnitrogen  oxide,  hydrocarbon  and  carbon  monoxide  which  are\r\n\r\nemitted  by  petrol-driven vehicles are more  harmful  than  the\r\n\r\nblack  smoke.   These toxic gases are not visible to  the  naked\r\n\r\neye,  and that makes detection difficult.  Even at the statutory\r\n\r\nroadworthiness  inspection  for  vehicles,  these  defects   are\r\n\r\nclassified  only  as minor faults that require no  rectification\r\n\r\nand no fine will be imposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister enlighten the House on what are the\r\n\r\npractices of other more advanced countries such as Japan, Europe\r\n\r\nand the USA with regard to the enforcement of the rules on black\r\n\r\nsmoke emission?  What are the rationale, standards and practices\r\n\r\nadopted  in imposing the penalty fines?  How many countries  are\r\n\r\nusing the Hartridge smoke meters?\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, the Chicago Convention on\r\n\r\nInternational Civil Aviation has established April 2002  as  the\r\n\r\ndeadline  for the world-wide withdrawal of larger,  older  civil\r\n\r\naircraft for use by operators.  The main reason for this move is\r\n\r\nnoise.   The larger older aircraft are much too noisy.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  United  States has set its own deadline  at  31st  December\r\n\r\n1999, that is,  end of this year.  As most of these larger older\r\n\r\naircraft are currently used in the US, there is fear that  these\r\n\r\naircraft  may be sold for use outside the US after  the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis year, ie, after the US\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeadline  but before the Convention-set deadline of April  2002.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  fear is so real that the European Union has acted  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the transfer of these aircraft from the US to  the  EU.\r\n\r\nAlthough this appears to be a Ministry of Communications' issue,\r\n\r\nthe  real  issue here is noise.  I am concerned with  the  noise\r\n\r\npollution which would be generated should these aircraft come to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Since noise pollution comes within the  purview  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  the  Environment, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the noise pollution standards set by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment stringent enough to prevent these aircraft from\r\n\r\nusing Changi International Airport?  If not, should we not  take\r\n\r\npreventive measures to stop these aircraft from coming here?  My\r\n\r\nquestion  must  be  taken within the context of  the  following:\r\n\r\nThere  are  many of these aircraft.  If they are not allowed  or\r\n\r\nnot permitted for operations in the huge first world markets  of\r\n\r\nthe  US and Europe, then there is a strong likelihood that  they\r\n\r\nwould be used in the third world market, including Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should take some preventive measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Shriniwas Rai, can you take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Mr Heng Chiang Meng earlier spoke of\r\n\r\nillegal  dumping.   I am coming to the problem  of  keeping  our\r\n\r\nrivers clean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of the Environment has spent millions of\r\n\r\ndollars and it has done a good job in keeping our rivers  clean.\r\n\r\nWe  no  longer have the foul smell we used to get.  But what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  now?   We can see discarded furniture and  everything\r\n\r\none  can think of being thrown into the river.  I live near  the\r\n\r\nWhampoa  River  where  I  go for a walk  almost  every  morning.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  the  river is clean and sometimes it  is  dirty.   I\r\n\r\nthink public education plus penal provision would be good.   May\r\n\r\nI  suggest  to  the  Minister that a Community  Watch  Group  be\r\n\r\nformed?   It  should also consider  appropriate  legislation  to\r\n\r\npunish  the  culprits.  In contrast to the  Whampoa  River,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore River is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncleaner.   I  do  not know why but the Minister  could  probably\r\n\r\nexplain to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important for us because I hope to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to allow boating in the river.  But as it is now, I  do\r\n\r\nnot think it would be feasible.  Can we one day, like many other\r\n\r\ncities in the world, have boats in our river?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I move to littering. Despite many years of effort,\r\n\r\nlittering still exists and it is a social disgrace to see people\r\n\r\nthrowing papers and bus tickets.  Last year, the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State explained to this House the efforts of his Ministry.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad that the Ministry takes this seriously.  Here again,  I\r\n\r\nhave a novel suggestion which the Minister may want to consider.\r\n\r\nAuthorise some of our national servicemen, especially  those who\r\n\r\nhave  served  in the Police Force, to book these people  because\r\n\r\nonly  when it hurts their pockets will Singaporeans learn  their\r\n\r\nlessons.  No amount of campaigns, Sir, after so many years since\r\n\r\nSM Lee Kuan Yew started the campaign will help. I am saddened to\r\n\r\nsay that we have progressed but we are retarded because of these\r\n\r\nsocial culprits.  May I ask the Minister to use his power to see\r\n\r\nthat this social evil is eradicated once and for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Although I have been bringing up this\r\n\r\nissue of tax incentives for pollution prevention and control and\r\n\r\nfor  environmental protection for several years already, I  want\r\n\r\nto do so again this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is well aware of this issue and the arguments\r\n\r\nfor  it.  I just want to remind him that he is not doing  enough\r\n\r\nto  encourage the move towards greater environmental protection.\r\n\r\nCompared  to  the  tax  and  other  financial  incentives  given\r\n\r\nannually  to promote the financial centre, the Green  Sector  is\r\n\r\nnot  even  getting peanuts.  Yet, environmental issues  are  the\r\n\r\nmost  pressing  issues facing mankind today.   By  actively  and\r\n\r\naggressively  promoting  the growth of  the  green  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  can  achieve two desirable goals.   One  is  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of the industry and its related clusters to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nserve  the  region and, of course, to serve Singapore.   We  can\r\n\r\nbecome  the green hub of the region.  It will add another  layer\r\n\r\nto our industrial base, thereby adding diversity to our economy.\r\n\r\nGiven the worldwide trend towards environmental protection,  the\r\n\r\neconomic and business benefits to Singapore would not be small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other goal is the encouragement of our companies to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  environmentally friendly machinery and processes  in\r\n\r\ntheir operations.  This can only result in a cleaner and greener\r\n\r\nenvironment for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely these are desirable goals to strive for. However,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need to have a champion, just like  that  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre.

I would like to know whether the job  has\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out to the satisfaction of the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment. Has the Ministry set out any criteria or  standards\r\n\r\nto  avoid  manipulation  by  the private  companies?   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  consider allowing more private companies to take  part\r\n\r\nin future tender exercises?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister tell us whether privatisation of refuse\r\n\r\ncollection  would  result in a cleaner environment  in  our  HDB\r\n\r\nestates  and  private  residential estates?  Will  it  cost  the\r\n\r\nresidents more for the disposal of their refuse?  If this scheme\r\n\r\nworks  out to be more efficient, I hope the Minister can quickly\r\n\r\nextend  it to the whole of Singapore for the benefit of all  the\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b>\r\n\r\nFirst, I would like to thank all the Members who have spoken for\r\n\r\ntheir views and suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take the first two speakers' points on illegal\r\n\r\ndumping.   I totally agree with Mr Heng that illegal dumping  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which is totally irresponsible and which is something\r\n\r\nthat  we should do our best to stamp out.  It is not just costly\r\n\r\nto  remove  the illegally dumped materials but in  the  process,\r\n\r\nquite  often, the culprits end up damaging the environment quite\r\n\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem, we really need to address two\r\n\r\nchallenges,  both  of which Mr Heng has also  touched  on.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  catching the culprits red handed.  This, as  Mr  Heng\r\n\r\npointed  out,  is difficult because they tend to  work  late  at\r\n\r\nnight  and  usually  in deserted areas.  Mr Heng  has  suggested\r\n\r\nempowering the community to help us solve this problem.   It  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  an attractive suggestion.  I would get my  staff  to\r\n\r\nwork with him because the more eyes and ears we have within  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  the  easier would it be for us to catch  them.   Not\r\n\r\nonly that, knowing that there are more people on the lookout for\r\n\r\nthem, the culprits would be also more deterred from engaging  in\r\n\r\nsuch activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second challenge that we have to cope with is how to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that the gains are dwarfed by the penalties.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment, the penalties are actually quite  low  because,\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  offence, the maximium  fine  is  only  $10,000.\r\n\r\nTypically,  the courts have been imposing fines of about  $1,000\r\n\r\nto  $7,000, which means that the penalty is actually  very  much\r\n\r\ndwarfed by the potential gain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already tabled the Bill for amending the relevant\r\n\r\nAct.   Once  the  Bill is passed, the penalties  for  the  first\r\n\r\noffence  would be increased from the current $10,000 to  $50,000\r\n\r\nplus  the  possibility of imprisonment of up to 12 months.   For\r\n\r\nthose who are caught for the second and subsequent offences, the\r\n\r\nfines  would  be  increased from a maximum of $20,000  today  to\r\n\r\n$100,000  plus  a mandatory jail sentence.  The  mandatory  jail\r\n\r\nsentence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be  not less than one month and not more than 12  months.\r\n\r\nThe  law  would also be amended to allow us to more  effectively\r\n\r\nseize  the  vehicles  that are being used.   With  the  enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties  and  with the more effective feedback  mechanism,  we\r\n\r\nshould be able to better contain this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has also asked about illegal dumping\r\n\r\nactivities  and  he  asked how many cases  of  illegally  dumped\r\n\r\nmaterials  on  agricultural sites were  caught  last  year.   We\r\n\r\nmounted  ambushes  at  several sites last  year  and  caught  21\r\n\r\noffenders.  They were fined between $900 and $8,000 each and two\r\n\r\nvehicles were seized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what are the other penalties, the Land Office will\r\n\r\nnormally  repossess the site.  There were seven cases last  year\r\n\r\nthat  were  repossessed.  It is not only that.  The Land  Office\r\n\r\nwill also forfeit the three months' rental deposit as a penalty.\r\n\r\nThe  culprits will also be asked to reinstate the land.  So with\r\n\r\nthe  enhanced  penalties under the new Bill, plus  more  regular\r\n\r\ninspections, we should be able to contain this problem as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the issue of haze. Mr Heng Chiang\r\n\r\nMeng  and  Mr  Simon Tay have spoken on this.  As  Mr  Heng  has\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed  out, the La Nina phenomenon  has  given  us  a\r\n\r\nslight  reprieve  because with the wetter than  normal  weather,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  expected to last until mid year, we should be  fairly\r\n\r\nfree from regional haze.  The normal weather pattern is expected\r\n\r\nto  return  in  the  second half of this  year  and  this  would\r\n\r\ncoincide  with the dry weather as well.  With the onset  of  dry\r\n\r\nweather, we can expect to see burning activity starting again in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and therefore we should be prepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we been doing to get ourselves ready for this?\r\n\r\nThe  key  activities  have been taking  place  in  the  regional\r\n\r\nsetting.  We  have finalised the regional haze action  plan  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  role  is  to  establish  a  proper  fire   fighting\r\n\r\nprocedure  as  well  as  to ensure that  there  are  appropriate\r\n\r\nenforcement procedures against the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nillegal  burning.  Because of the economic crisis, we fear  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a lack of political will in the  Government to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these  two roles are being catered for.  For  example,  in\r\n\r\nworking  with the Indonesians, what we have found is that  there\r\n\r\nis  really  no clear organisational structure in terms  of  both\r\n\r\nenforcement and fire fighting.  So when a fire breaks out, there\r\n\r\nis  confusion as to which body is responsible for first spotting\r\n\r\nthe  fire  and,  secondly,  taking action  to  fight  the  fire.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  who will now step in to investigate, find the  culprit\r\n\r\nand  charge them in court?  There is no proper structure.  Also,\r\n\r\nin  our dealings with the Indonesians, we realise that there are\r\n\r\nactually  many people who are quite concerned about this.   They\r\n\r\nare in charge of departments and they want to do something.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately, because of the economic crisis, they are short of\r\n\r\nfunds  and  therefore they are unable to purchase the  necessary\r\n\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been working with the ASEAN members on this issue.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue to urge Indonesia to strengthen their efforts\r\n\r\nagainst  illegal burning and to urge them to set up  the  proper\r\n\r\norganisational structure.  We have also proceeded to  help  them\r\n\r\npurchase some of the equipment.   For example, we have over  the\r\n\r\nlast year supplied them with communications equipment which will\r\n\r\nenable  them to spot where the fires are burning and  relay  the\r\n\r\ninformation   down  to  the  ground.   All  the   communications\r\n\r\nequipment  are now in place.  We now have to see how do  we  get\r\n\r\nthem  to  make  good use of this equipment. This  is  where  the\r\n\r\npolitical will comes in.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the funding, we have been working with various\r\n\r\ninternational agencies, like UNEP.  And I understand  that  UNEP\r\n\r\nwill  be working with other UN and international bodies as  well\r\n\r\non  the  funding, and to work with the donor countries to assist\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to  enhance  its ability and capacity.   So  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work through all the various organisations and  with\r\n\r\nour  neighbouring  countries  to ensure  that  there  is  enough\r\n\r\npressure being exerted on Indonesia to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  this  problem seriously, because this is a  problem  which\r\n\r\naffects not just us but, more importantly, it affects themselves\r\n\r\nto a much greater degree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On diesel emissions, it is interesting to see the two\r\n\r\nopposing  views.   One is from Prof. Low Seow  Chay  who  firmly\r\n\r\nbelieves  that  we should take firm action to ensure  that  this\r\n\r\npollution  problem is being tackled effectively.  And the  other\r\n\r\nview  from Mr Ong Ah Heng who asks us not to be too harsh.   Let\r\n\r\nme start with the points raised by Mr Ong Ah Heng first, because\r\n\r\nI think it is important for us to understand why this problem is\r\n\r\nan important one that needs to be tackled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, diesel smoke contains very fine particulates\r\n\r\nof less than 2.5 microns, or what we call PM2.5.  The studies in\r\n\r\nthe  US  and  elsewhere  have linked PM2.5  to  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nrespiratory diseases and mortality.  So contrary to what Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nbelieves,  PM2.5 diesel particulates are actually  dangerous  to\r\n\r\nhealth.   Therefore,  it is prudent for us to  keep  the  diesel\r\n\r\nsmoke  to  as  low a level as possible in order to  protect  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of our people.  This problem is not a difficult  one  to\r\n\r\novercome  because  this diesel smoke can  be  minimised  if  the\r\n\r\nengines are properly maintained.  And therefore we have  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  penalties  to  act  as deterrence  against  irresponsible\r\n\r\nbehaviour by owners and drivers of diesel-driven vehicles.  Yes,\r\n\r\nthe  penalties may be harsh, but the penalties can  be  avoided,\r\n\r\nand I think that is a key point.  The taxi drivers and the lorry\r\n\r\ndrivers can avoid paying these penalties by ensuring that  their\r\n\r\nvehicles are maintained regularly and properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong also mentioned about the penalties being\r\n\r\nenhanced.  Actually the enhanced penalties are still lower  than\r\n\r\nwhat  the courts were imposing, because the courts were imposing\r\n\r\npenalties  from $600 to over $1,000.  Whereas now by compounding\r\n\r\nthe  offences, the offenders do not have to appear in court,  so\r\n\r\nactually  we  are  saving them time.  Secondly,  the  compounded\r\n\r\npenalty  is only $500.  In actual fact, the penalties have  been\r\n\r\nreduced rather than increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked why petrol-driven vehicles are not\r\n\r\nrequired  to  go for a re-test, if they fail the emission  test.\r\n\r\nContrary  to  what he believes, the carbon monoxide  test  is  a\r\n\r\nmandatory  one.  And if petrol-driven vehicles fail  the  carbon\r\n\r\nmonoxide test, it is mandatory for them to go for a re-test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked what is the practice of the advanced\r\n\r\ncountries.  The advanced countries, in fact, have more stringent\r\n\r\nemission  standards than ours.  And because their standards  are\r\n\r\nmore  stringent, the likelihood of the vehicles  emitting  black\r\n\r\nsmoke  is also reduced.  Also, I understand that they have  very\r\n\r\nstrict controls on maintenance of the vehicles.  As to how  many\r\n\r\ncountries use the Hartridge smoke meters to measure the  density\r\n\r\nof  smoke  emission, I am happy to let him  know  that  all  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries use the same Hartridge  meters  as  we  are\r\n\r\nusing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has asked whether we have relaxed the\r\n\r\nvehicle emission standards because of the economic slowdown.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to assure him that we have not.  In fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nrecently moved to reduce the allowable sulphur content in diesel\r\n\r\nfrom  0.3% previously to 0.05% since 1st March this year.   This\r\n\r\nlower  sulphur  content  would reduce the  emission  of  sulphur\r\n\r\ndioxide,  which  is  another  very  undesirable  pollutant.   It\r\n\r\nreduces  SO2  by  80%,  and the particulate  emission  from  the\r\n\r\nengines by 50%.  So this reduction of sulphur has got benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about the impact of the price increase. In\r\n\r\nfact,  owners  of  diesel-driven vehicles  are  having  a  price\r\n\r\nreduction.  Because even though the price of diesel has gone  up\r\n\r\nby  2  cents,  we have removed the tax on diesel.  So  net,  the\r\n\r\nowners still have a saving on the price of diesel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government considering stricter emission standards?\r\n\r\nYes,  with  the introduction of the 0.05% sulphur in diesel,  we\r\n\r\nare now able to consider stricter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemission  standards.  These standards have,  in  fact,  been  in\r\n\r\nplace in Europe since 1996.  As Prof. Low has mentioned, the new\r\n\r\nvehicles,  in order to meet these standards, would  need  to  be\r\n\r\nfitted with a catalytic converter and a particulate trap.  As to\r\n\r\nwhen  we are going to introduce the new standards, we are  still\r\n\r\nstudying them, and we will be announcing the decision shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked about the noise pollution from\r\n\r\naircraft.   He  asked whether the noise pollution standards  are\r\n\r\nstringent  enough for us to prevent these aircraft  from  flying\r\n\r\nhere.   I  would like to assure him that the likelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nolder  aircraft being diverted to Singapore is very,  very  low,\r\n\r\nbecause  today  more  than 90% of the aircraft  using  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport are the newer aircraft classified under Chapter 3 of the\r\n\r\nConvention.   This  is because most of the airlines  that  serve\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport are the major airlines, and these are the ones\r\n\r\nthat  are in the process of continually upgrading their aircraft\r\n\r\nand  using  newer aircraft.  So despite the move by  the  US  to\r\n\r\nphase out the older aircraft by end of this year, the likelihood\r\n\r\nof these aircraft being moved here is very, very low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai has talked about littering and clean\r\n\r\nrivers.  Sir, I will take both of them together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I totally agree with him. I share his concerns about\r\n\r\nthe littering that is taking place in Singapore, despite several\r\n\r\ndecades  of Keep Singapore Clean Campaign.  We have done surveys\r\n\r\namongst the teenagers. And what we find is that the awareness of\r\n\r\nthe  need to keep Singapore clean and the need to not litter  is\r\n\r\nvery  wide.   That  means all teenagers know about  it,  because\r\n\r\nthrough  the schools and public campaigns, they have  been  made\r\n\r\naware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the data on litterbugs, what surprises us\r\n\r\nis  that  two-thirds of the litterbugs are aged below  30  years\r\n\r\nold,  ie,  these are the ones who have gone through  the  school\r\n\r\neducation and the public education programme.  So it is not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlack   of   awareness.   I  think  it  is  a  lack   of   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  The fortunate part is that litterbugs are still\r\n\r\nthe minority.  The majority of Singaporeans are very proud about\r\n\r\nthe  clean  environment and they do take efforts not to  litter.\r\n\r\nThe  question  is how do we deal with the negative  attitude  of\r\n\r\nthis  small group of dirty Singaporeans.  Our approach,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned  by Mr Rai, is education.  I think  we  have  to\r\n\r\nreach  out  not just to educate Singaporeans but to create  peer\r\n\r\npressure on those who are inclined to litter.  And what  we  are\r\n\r\nlooking now is how do we involve the community in a much greater\r\n\r\nway.  For example, the Keep Singapore Clean Campaign, which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  driven by my Ministry primarily, I have asked my officials\r\n\r\nto  make  that  into a civic movement, and to let the  community\r\n\r\nleaders drive this campaign from now on, rather than to  let  it\r\n\r\ncontinue as being a Government campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken steps to enhance the penalties, which I\r\n\r\nthink  is  important.  We need both the carrot  and  the  stick.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  offenders are only given  the  Corrective  Work\r\n\r\nOrder.   Under the revised penalties, the recalcitrant would  be\r\n\r\nliable to both the CWO and a fine.  And the maximum duration for\r\n\r\nthe  CWO would be increased from three hours to a maximum of  12\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about the dumping of bulky items like furniture.\r\n\r\nWe  are  also increasing penalties for illegal dumping of  bulky\r\n\r\nitems like furniture on the roadsides and void decks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his unhappiness about the Whampoa River being dirtied, I\r\n\r\nalso  share his concerns.  We have spent 20-over years to  clean\r\n\r\nup the rivers.  Today, one can actually swim in the rivers.  And\r\n\r\nyet  people still do litter.  How big is the problem?  To ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the litter does not get into our water resources,  because\r\n\r\n40%  of Singapore is a catchment area, and the drains and canals\r\n\r\nin  this  part of Singapore drain into our reservoirs,  we  have\r\n\r\nplaced float booms and gratings to collect the litter.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  will surprise Members to know that each day, we collect over\r\n\r\n40  tonnes  of litter from the canals and the rivers, enough  to\r\n\r\nfill 10 truck loads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to join Mr Shriniwas Rai in urging\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to exert peer pressure, because we cannot be around\r\n\r\neverywhere  all  the time to spot the litterbugs.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan.  Let us all join together in this exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tax incentives - this is a perennial subject. I am\r\n\r\nglad we have a champion in Mr Heng Chiang Meng on tax incentives\r\n\r\nto  promote the environmental protection industry.  I would like\r\n\r\nto assure him that all the incentives that are available for the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  and  the  service  industries  are   also\r\n\r\navailable   to   the   environmental  protection   industry   or\r\n\r\nenvironmental  technology industry.  Indeed, EDB  also  keeps  a\r\n\r\nlook-out  for potential companies to bring to Singapore.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the data here, but I was given a briefing recently and\r\n\r\nwas  told  that, in fact, the number of large companies  in  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  technology  field  that  are  now  operating   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been steadily increasing.  So we are seeing  more\r\n\r\ncompanies  moving to Singapore to serve not just  Singapore  but\r\n\r\nalso  the  region.  And I think in the process,  our  own  local\r\n\r\ncompanies will also benefit from the technology transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also encouraging companies to invest in pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol  equipment.   For example, we have  now  introduced  the\r\n\r\naccelerated  depreciation  allowance scheme  to  companies  that\r\n\r\npurchase  such equipment.  This year, the Finance  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nsupported  my  Ministry's  proposal to extend  this  accelerated\r\n\r\ndepreciation  allowance  to  the  purchase  of  new   commercial\r\n\r\nvehicles  that  are being used to replace the old  diesel-driven\r\n\r\nvehicles.  So we will continue to look for more ways to help the\r\n\r\nindustry  and we will continue to work with the key  players  in\r\n\r\nthe industry on how ENV can assist them further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to ask my Senior Minister of State to\r\n\r\nanswer the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek bin Saniff):  Sir, first, let me thank Mr Heng Chiang\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMeng  for his valuable observation regarding food safety or food\r\n\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent incidence cited by the MP has highlighted\r\n\r\nhow  inadequate control on food safety can give rise to  serious\r\n\r\nproblems  even  in developed countries with good  public  health\r\n\r\nservices.  While Singaporeans today enjoy a food supply that  is\r\n\r\namong  the  safest  in the world, we are constantly  facing  new\r\n\r\nthreats  of  massive  outbreaks  of  food-borne  diseases.   Our\r\n\r\nemphasis  in  Singapore  is  on vigilance,  control  and  public\r\n\r\neducation  that  range from checking the  source  of  food  from\r\n\r\noverseas  suppliers  to the education and enforcement  of  local\r\n\r\nfood  manufacturers and food handlers in our food centres.  This\r\n\r\nis backed by a system of infectious disease notification so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  act  swiftly to contain any outbreak should  it  occur.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  my  Ministry closely monitors the food  situation  and\r\n\r\nemerging  food-related  diseases in the  region  and  worldwide.\r\n\r\nOfficers  in my Ministry also keep in close contact  with  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the region.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the PPD is also very stringent in its control on\r\n\r\nthe  import of meat, fish, vegetable and other primary products.\r\n\r\nOnly  produce  from approved sources is allowed  to  enter  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my Ministry and the PPD has a structured system\r\n\r\nfor  surveillance  and regular inspection of food  manufacturers\r\n\r\nand  retailers to ensure that food is prepared under  clean  and\r\n\r\nhygienic conditions.  Through public education, training courses\r\n\r\nfor  food  handlers,  food  factory programmes  and  enforcement\r\n\r\naction, a high standard of food hygiene is maintained.   We  are\r\n\r\nvigilant on high risk food and we would not hesitate to  act  if\r\n\r\nthere is an unacceptable risk to our public health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, in spite of all that we can do, on the\r\n\r\npreventive  side, we must make preparations should  an  outbreak\r\n\r\noccur.   ENV has therefore established an inter-agency  response\r\n\r\nprocedure involving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMOH and PPD to handle food-related incidents.  This will enhance\r\n\r\nour   level  of  preparedness,  as  a  nation,  to  handle   any\r\n\r\ncontingency.   Because  of  our high standard  of  environmental\r\n\r\nsanitation   and  food  hygiene,  our  risks   are   low.    Our\r\n\r\nenvironmental  health  surveillance  capabilities  have   gained\r\n\r\nformal   international  recognition  when   the   World   Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation  designated the Ministry's Epidemiology  Department\r\n\r\nas a regional coordinating centre in 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Peh Chin Hua is a very hardworking MP. I must say\r\n\r\nthat  the criteria used in the assessment are strictly based  on\r\n\r\nhygiene-related   matters   such   as   (1)   housekeeping   and\r\n\r\ncleanliness,  for  example, whether the  storage  cupboards  are\r\n\r\nclean and not infested with cockroaches and other vermins;   (2)\r\n\r\nfood  and personal hygiene, for example, whether raw and  cooked\r\n\r\nfood  is  properly stored and whether the food handler  observes\r\n\r\npersonal hygiene and cleanliness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-hygiene related matters are not part of the assessment\r\n\r\ncriteria.   For  example, we do not assess  how  the  hawker  is\r\n\r\ndressed  but  he  must be clean.  If he wears clothes  that  are\r\n\r\nfilthy  and  dirty, then of course this would not do.   How  the\r\n\r\ngoods are displayed and how the stall is organised are also  not\r\n\r\nfactors  that will determine the grade of the outlet so long  as\r\n\r\nfood  hygiene is not compromised.  Ultimately, we would like  to\r\n\r\nsee  all  our food vendors committed to a high standard of  food\r\n\r\nand  personal hygiene regardless of the type of food and the way\r\n\r\nthat they are selling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several questions that are asked. I would like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  his  colleagues for having their  own  assessment.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must  say  to  Mr  Peh  that  that  is  more  for  local\r\n\r\ncompetition.   Most probably, everybody knows the time,  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   Whereas as far as ENV is concerned, we assess over  the\r\n\r\nwhole  year.   If I am not mistaken, Mr Peh also suggested  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  a  category \"P\"  and  \"F\".   Sir,  it  was  a\r\n\r\nremarkable coincidence that when we embarked on our scheme,  the\r\n\r\nCounty of LA was also having the same grading system.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextended  this system to the City of Los Angeles.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nI will ask my officials to look into Mr Peh's suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the  dengue  fever  cases  are  always  on   the\r\n\r\nincrease.   Once again, I would be brief.  I wonder  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould accept this because I have been assured that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  done  its best and this increase is a world phenomenon.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to make two points.  One of the more effective  ways\r\n\r\nto  reduce the breeding activities is by fogging.  Nowadays, the\r\n\r\nMinistry only does it when there is a complaint.  Can I ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  whether  it  can  have  a  fixed  schedule  to  do  it\r\n\r\nregularly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to make is that the increase\r\n\r\nin  dengue  cases  reported in Singapore is mainly  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnowadays  and  it  seems that the trend  is  going  upwards.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the Town Council of Marine Parade  is  working\r\n\r\nvery  closely  with  the  Environment  Ministry  and  they  have\r\n\r\nachieved some success.  Does the Ministry have a plan to involve\r\n\r\nall the town councils in Singapore so that they can benefit from\r\n\r\nthis  close cooperation?  I hope that, next year, I do not  have\r\n\r\nto bring up this subject again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I will make it short. We\r\n\r\nwill  most  certainly take up Mr Kenneth Chen's suggestion.   We\r\n\r\nwill have a more coordinated approach with the town councils  on\r\n\r\ndengue  control in the town council estates.  In fact, there  is\r\n\r\nalready  a standing arrangement where the town council  officers\r\n\r\nare  invited  to  join in on inspections or ground  surveillance\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  officers in my Ministry.   During  this  joint\r\n\r\ninspection,  my  officers will show the  town  council  officers\r\n\r\nwhere  to  look  for  potential breeding  grounds  and,  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess, train them on vector control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will also work with the Contractors'\r\n\r\nAssociation and the professional bodies to get them to pay close\r\n\r\nattention to housekeeping in the construction worksites  and  to\r\n\r\nconsider  features  in  their design that will  not  unwittingly\r\n\r\ncreate potential breeding places.  We will also upgrade the pest\r\n\r\ncontrol  industry  so  that  they can  help  us  by  being  more\r\n\r\neffective  in  their vector control work.

Such a central body can help\r\n\r\nto  coordinate,  inform and promote volunteerism  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially to meet future demands for volunteers and to help run\r\n\r\nmany  social programmes in the neighbourhood of various  housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, the profiles of our neighbourhood are\r\n\r\nchanging.    Some  are  ageing  and  there  are   mobility   and\r\n\r\ntransitions  in  these neighbourhoods.  We need to  examine  and\r\n\r\nstudy them in greater detail to see what we can do to respond to\r\n\r\nthe new service needs in these areas and the types of programmes\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  get people to organise and tackle them.   As  you\r\n\r\nknow,  Sir, your neighbourhood is also ageing as well  as  mine.\r\n\r\nIt  is very important that we appreciate and understand this  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to persuade more people to  join  in  the\r\n\r\nvolunteer work for the care of the people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our volunteer participation, at this moment, is only 1:10.\r\n\r\nWe  should try to increase this participation level to at  least\r\n\r\n2:10  in  the next five years.  In many advanced countries,  the\r\n\r\nparticipation rate is about 3:10.  So we have a long way to  go.\r\n\r\nA  central body to mobilise people of various social, ethnic and\r\n\r\nreligious  backgrounds  to volunteer  helps  to  achieve  a  few\r\n\r\nobjectives.  First, it promotes social integration and  prevents\r\n\r\nsocial  division.   This is very important  in  the  context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We are living in a multi-racial society.   We  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  social  classes living in different housing  estates,\r\n\r\nand  therefore it is very important that we examine  this  issue\r\n\r\nvery  carefully  and  see  how we can manage  these  challenges.\r\n\r\nFailing to do this may have unintended consequences in terms  of\r\n\r\nsocial division, tensions and other related problems that we may\r\n\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the establishment of a central body, where\r\n\r\nwe  can  mobilise  volunteers  to participate,  is  crucial  and\r\n\r\nimportant to us.  At the same time, this central body is able to\r\n\r\ninvolve  people and strengthen the bonds among people living  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  neighbourhoods.  People bonding  is  critical  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we should try, through this central body, to  enhance\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can encourage self-help and community problem-solving.\r\n\r\nI see we are always being accused that by providing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfunding support to the people care sector, we are moving towards\r\n\r\nwelfarism.  I do not think so.  By encouraging people to play  a\r\n\r\nrole to organise themselves, to participate in community problem-solving, in fact, helps prevent social problems from arising.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  prevention  is better than cure and I  hope  that  we  all\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  it,  and  if we believe in  it,  we  should  deploy\r\n\r\nresources  to  the very area that we can build participation  of\r\n\r\npeople to be involved in building a caring community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, by having such a central body, it will reduce\r\n\r\nhuman  barriers  and  human  barriers  can  be  broken  down  by\r\n\r\nencouraging more people to volunteer and help one another.   And\r\n\r\nthis is what we want of Singapore and I hope that we can help to\r\n\r\npromote it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many calls by voluntary organisations for the\r\n\r\nestablishment of such a central body because at the  moment  the\r\n\r\nmobilisation  and recruitment of volunteers, and the information\r\n\r\nto people about where to volunteer are very much segmented.  The\r\n\r\nneed  for a central body is very crucial and important in trying\r\n\r\nto  get  more  people to be involved in the people care  sector.\r\n\r\nWhen we do this, in the long run, we will be able to promote the\r\n\r\nsocial  help  of our community and we would be able  to  enhance\r\n\r\nmore effective problem-solving in the various neighbourhoods  of\r\n\r\nour housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is related to the grants to voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations.   Many requests have been made to the  Government\r\n\r\nto  review  grants  to  voluntary  welfare  organisations.   The\r\n\r\nappeals are loud and clear and I am sure many of you have  heard\r\n\r\nthis  in  the  course  of your work with the  various  voluntary\r\n\r\nbodies  in  your own constituency.  We should send a message  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance to see whether more  funds  could  be\r\n\r\nallocated to this aspect of work.  I am afraid that it  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  heard  for some time and I hope that this time round,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  hear  and accede to the  appeals.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  voluntary  organisations to do more  without  additional\r\n\r\nfinancial grants.  To do more they will, if they are persuaded,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencouraged, but you cannot do anything without funding and other\r\n\r\nrelated support, both capital and operational costs.  And I feel\r\n\r\nthis  is  essential if you are going to encourage more voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  to  be formed and to take an active  interest  in\r\n\r\ncommunity problem-solving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More time is spent by volunteers and staff on fund-raising\r\n\r\nand  by  doing  so  at  the sacrifice of  managing  the  service\r\n\r\ndelivery of organisations and be able to think ahead on  how  to\r\n\r\nrespond more effectively.  Although they may be able to know the\r\n\r\nnew  problems, they are unable to respond as quickly as possible\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the limitation of funds.  At times,  the  efficient\r\n\r\nrunning  of  the organisations is sacrificed at the  expense  of\r\n\r\nspending a lot of time on fund-raising, which is necessary.  But\r\n\r\ntoo  much effort spent on fund-raising during a very competitive\r\n\r\nperiod  means  that  there is less time for  people  who  manage\r\n\r\norganisations to plan ahead in terms of what needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental question that we should ask is: do we want\r\n\r\nmore  voluntary welfare organisations to be established  and  to\r\n\r\ntake  on  additional functions?  If it is positive towards  this\r\n\r\nquestion,  then the answer is how do we go about to enable  them\r\n\r\nto  take on additional responsibilities?  At this juncture,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health wants these organisations to do more with the\r\n\r\nnew  health  care programmes for the elderly.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  on  the  other hand, has started  programmes  of\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  policing  and community focus  programmes.   This\r\n\r\nwould  also require the mobilisation of help from various social\r\n\r\norganisations,  and  this  is  also  demanding.   Finally,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of   Community  Development  is  moving  towards  more\r\n\r\nneighbourhood care and programmes.  This will also  require  the\r\n\r\nparticipation   and  efforts  of  many  social   and   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that we need to examine this question of\r\n\r\nproviding  grants to voluntary organisations more seriously.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  state that it is no fun not to  be  given  more\r\n\r\nfunds, and yet asked to do more by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  state that fund raising is trying,  competitive\r\n\r\nand  time-consuming  and I hope that the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to persuade the Ministry of Finance  to  release\r\n\r\nmore  funds to the people care sector because we could  be  more\r\n\r\nproactive  and  be able to meet the needs of the  families,  the\r\n\r\naging  population  and  the older unskilled  workers  that  were\r\n\r\nretrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our voluntary organisations to be viable and responsive\r\n\r\nto  the emerging needs of the neighbourhood.  I am sure you  all\r\n\r\nagree  with me that this is the thrust that we should take.   It\r\n\r\nis necessary to revise the funding formula for government grants\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Ministry  of Health has a different  formula.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community Development gives  a  different  funding\r\n\r\nformula  to  the  Community Development Councils  and  it  gives\r\n\r\nanother  funding formula to the voluntary sector.  There  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  funding  formulas.  But,  none  of  these  help  the\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations at this juncture.  We should look at the\r\n\r\nrevision of the funding formula seriously.  By doing so, we  can\r\n\r\ngenerate  more  enthusiasm  for the voluntary  organisations  to\r\n\r\nimprove  and extend their services.  I suggest that a 75%  grant\r\n\r\nfor programme cost would be reasonable and realistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In granting more support to the social and voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations,  we  can  prevent social divide  amongst  various\r\n\r\nethnic  groups and the community.  We can reduce ethnic tensions\r\n\r\nfrom  surfacing  in  future when we have more voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  to  mediate and solve problems faced  by  various\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  groups.  I foresee this can be  a  serious  issue\r\n\r\nthat we should avoid.  There are other new issues and challenges\r\n\r\nand  we  do  not  want  to have a wider  social  divide  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  our  society.   And  therefore,  the  support  to\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations would be useful and important.   Social\r\n\r\nabrasions  can  be  reduced  with  some  generosity   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   We  should not be just seen as  taking,  but  also\r\n\r\ngiving  where  and when necessary.  This should be  the  thrust,\r\n\r\nboth\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngiving and taking, and it is essential.  I am sure through  this\r\n\r\nprocess,  we  will  be  able  to  build  a  more  cohesive   and\r\n\r\nprogressive community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the point that I\r\n\r\nwish to actually speak about has, in fact, been advocated by the\r\n\r\nMP for Tanjong Pagar, Dr S Vasoo, and that is the creation of  a\r\n\r\ncentralised  body to promote volunteerism.  It is  a  recognised\r\n\r\nfact  that  in  spite  of  vigorous upliftment  efforts  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the respective ethnic communities in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthere  would always be people who have difficulty  to  cope.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve it is therefore important that we cast the net wider  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the less fortunate improve themselves.  This is especially\r\n\r\nimportant  as  we  continue  to push towards  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   There would be emerging social problems,  contributed\r\n\r\nprimarily by structural unemployment.  If these problems are not\r\n\r\nproperly  identified and strategies carried out at  an  advanced\r\n\r\nstage,  these  problems could multiply, sap  our  resources  and\r\n\r\nlimit our capacity for further progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Singapore 21 was launched to cast new ideals\r\n\r\nfor  the  21st Century Singapore, consistent with Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh's  desire  to  have  all Singaporeans  join  hands  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  our  best  home.  To make his  vision  a  reality,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that a strong spirit of volunteerism must also prevail,\r\n\r\nand  what  is more important is that it must transcend good  and\r\n\r\ndifficult economic times.  The strong and the successful must be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  come  forward to assist  the  weak  and  the  less\r\n\r\nfortunate.   Beyond Singapore 21, we need to  also  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere is always a dedicated pool of volunteers who are committed\r\n\r\nto the cause of the community and who will readily be around, no\r\n\r\nmatter what the economic conditions may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to, once again, reiterate and echo\r\n\r\nwhat  Dr  Vasoo had earlier on advocated, that is, the formation\r\n\r\nof  a  centralised  body,  who could devise  schemes  to  build,\r\n\r\nencourage and support a strong volunteer movement.  This  body's\r\n\r\nprimary objective should be to promote\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  inculcate the spirit of volunteerism that is resilient  and\r\n\r\nthat will complement Government's and other civic organisations'\r\n\r\neffort so as to develop a more cohesive and gracious society  in\r\n\r\n21st Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, the range of social and\r\n\r\nwelfare services provided by many well meaning voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations is commendable.  The allocation of these resources\r\n\r\nis currently performed by the Ministry of Community Development.\r\n\r\nThe   question  we  have  to  ask  ourselves  is   whether   the\r\n\r\navailability and the demand matches.  The question  is  all  the\r\n\r\nmore  important as it is more difficult to get funding  in  this\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic  climate.  Are we allocating scarce  resources\r\n\r\nefficiently?  I am of the view that this is not always so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the Before-and-After-School-Care Centres (BASC)\r\n\r\nthat  have  closed down, day care centres that are underutilised\r\n\r\nand  the  long queues and waiting period for childcare  centres,\r\n\r\nand  one  will  begin to understand why such resources  are  not\r\n\r\noptimally allocated.  It is the norm that the GRO advisors get a\r\n\r\nletter from MCD informing them that they have decided to set  up\r\n\r\na  certain  service  at a location without  asking  the  advisor\r\n\r\nwhether  the  service is required and whether  the  location  is\r\n\r\nappropriate.   It  is  frustrating to  VWOs  that  having  spent\r\n\r\nconsiderable  effort raising funds, time and  energy  developing\r\n\r\nthe  centre, only to find that the service is not required.   It\r\n\r\nis  not only a waste of resources but also very disheartening to\r\n\r\nVWOs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for MCD to work more closely with the GROs. The\r\n\r\nadvisor  of  the  GROs will be familiar with the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople in his estate and will be able to advise on not only  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  service  required, but also the quantity  of  services\r\n\r\nrequired  and where the optimal site will be.  I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  look at the way that such resources are  allocated\r\n\r\nand  perhaps work more closely with the advisors of the GROs  to\r\n\r\nhave optimal allocation of these scarce resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, our Government has always believed in\r\n\r\nthe principle that members of the community must play a part  in\r\n\r\nhelping  to care for the less fortunate members of our  society.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to ensure that the social problems which we  encounter\r\n\r\nare  not  conveniently  passed on  to  the  State.   This  would\r\n\r\ninclude, for instance, caring for the elderly citizens and those\r\n\r\nwho  are  handicapped.  In adopting this principle of co-sharing\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility,  the  Government  has  had,  amongst  other\r\n\r\nthings,  to work with voluntary welfare organisations in funding\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  programmes.  Customarily, our Government  would\r\n\r\nmatch  the  sum  of  money  raised by  these  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  to increase the resource pool available  for  the\r\n\r\nsocial programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, therefore, many VWOs are engaged in fund\r\n\r\nraising  exercises in order to increase the resources  available\r\n\r\nto  fund  the  programmes.   The NCSS,  which  is  the  umbrella\r\n\r\norganisation covering many of these VWOs in Singapore, is one of\r\n\r\nthe  largest  recipients  of  public  donations  and  Government\r\n\r\nfunding for social programmes.  One has no doubt that the  money\r\n\r\nthat has gone into the NCSS is well used and well managed by the\r\n\r\nNCSS   to   assist  its  member  organisations  in  its  various\r\n\r\nactivities.   The  sums  received  by  many  voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  are  not small.  However,  following  the  recent\r\n\r\nepisode  wherein a member of the public had wrongly accused  the\r\n\r\nCEO of NKF of misusing the Foundation's funds, many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave indeed begun to ask whether there are proper guidelines  as\r\n\r\nto  how the money that is given by members of the public and the\r\n\r\nGovernment should be spent, and whether there is an audit system\r\n\r\nin  place to ensure that these guidelines are adhered to.  These\r\n\r\nguidelines  must surely be based on the principles of  achieving\r\n\r\ngreater effectiveness and efficiency for the VWOs, so that every\r\n\r\ndollar  given  can be stretched longer.  If there  is  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  taxpayers' money and donations by members  of  the  public\r\n\r\nwould  be made to good use, I am sure that it would serve as  an\r\n\r\nencouragement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor many more people to put in money into the organisation for a\r\n\r\nuseful and proper cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if it was discovered that the money\r\n\r\ndonated  to an organisation is not very well managed,  then  the\r\n\r\norganisation concerned should change its principal  officers  or\r\n\r\nsuffer the consequence of not having any public support for  its\r\n\r\nactivities.  MCD should therefore perform this watchdog function\r\n\r\nin  ensuring that the money granted to these organisations would\r\n\r\nbe put to proper use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Community Development\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry would consider implementing a  system  of\r\n\r\naudit  control on all voluntary welfare organisations to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat these organisations are administered in accordance with the\r\n\r\nguidelines  and  standards set by the  Ministry,  and  that  the\r\n\r\ngrants  given by the Government and donations by members of  the\r\n\r\npublic are properly used.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, social workers work\r\n\r\nquietly  and spontaneously, sacrificing their time to serve  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate  people  in society and bring  them  warmth.   Their\r\n\r\nspirit  is worthy of our emulation.  But social workers  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  have  not  been  given  due  social  status,  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  recognition for their contributions is  also  very\r\n\r\nlimited.  Of course, social workers do not expect the Government\r\n\r\nto give them any benefit, neither do they work as volunteers for\r\n\r\nthe  so-called benefits.  But I feel strongly that it is  unfair\r\n\r\nto  these  noble  voluntary workers not  to  be  given  the  due\r\n\r\nrecognition from the authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, grassroots leaders enjoy free parking\r\n\r\nfacilities in their constituency, whereas  social workers do not\r\n\r\nget   such   concession.   Sometimes,  because  of  their   work\r\n\r\ncommitments,   they  are  fined because the  validity  of  their\r\n\r\ncoupons  has expired.  They work for free, and yet they have  to\r\n\r\nincur out-of-pocket expenses.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  given  money  for  the  construction   of   the\r\n\r\nGrassroots'  Club,  so  that grassroots  leaders  can  have  the\r\n\r\nprestige of having an exclusive club of their own.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  Government does not even give a thought to   provide\r\n\r\nsimilar facilities to the voluntary social workers, so that they\r\n\r\ncan mingle together and exchange experiences and information and\r\n\r\nstrengthen their determination to serve the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nconsider  building a similar club for social  workers.   Why  is\r\n\r\nthere  such  a  difference in treatment?   Is  it   because  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations are serving the interest of the PAP and\r\n\r\nare therefore given these special privileges?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in my\r\n\r\nmaiden  speech in November 1997, I called for the need  to  give\r\n\r\ngreater  recognition to professional social workers  to  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir  image  and  standing,  and to  invest  resources  at  the\r\n\r\ntertiary level to develop competent professional social  workers\r\n\r\nto meet the long-term need of the social service sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, a number of initiatives were undertaken\r\n\r\nwhich gave the sector a boost.  Inviting social workers to  have\r\n\r\ntea  with  the President at the Istana was a huge success.   The\r\n\r\nOutstanding  Social  Worker award was yet  another  recognition.\r\n\r\nGiving scholarships to students studying social work was a great\r\n\r\nincentive to attract more students into the field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me, Sir, to highlight my continued concerns on\r\n\r\nskills  development and professionalising the service  delivery.\r\n\r\nFirst, what is the progress in reviewing the status recognition,\r\n\r\nremuneration and benefits of social workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the shortage of qualified social workers is still a\r\n\r\nproblem.   The  Family Court, for example,  currently  has  nine\r\n\r\ncounsellors.   There are six more vacancies to  be  filled,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are no takers.  I was told that it was difficult to  find\r\n\r\nsuitable counsellors.  This seems to be a common\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstory for most VWOs and the inadequacy became more apparent when\r\n\r\nspecialised  care  is  needed, like speech  therapists  for  the\r\n\r\nmentally  challenged, specialised treatment  programme  for  the\r\n\r\nautistic,  trained  placement officers  to  help  integrate  the\r\n\r\ndisabled  in  employment situations, trained social workers  for\r\n\r\nrehabilitating  men  in  jail  who  are  coping   with   violent\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   The list goes on.  My question to the Minister  is:\r\n\r\nhas  the  Ministry carried out an in-depth study to address  the\r\n\r\nmanpower shortage of the social service industry as a whole?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is skills development, an ongoing concern\r\n\r\ndue to the increasing need for a continuum of services to attend\r\n\r\nto  the  problems of the young, the youths, the elderly and  the\r\n\r\ndisabled.   Could  the Minister inform the  House  what  is  the\r\n\r\nprogress  in developing the formalised and specialised  training\r\n\r\nfor social workers as well as volunteers?  Is there a broadening\r\n\r\nof post-graduate social work training modules at the polytechnic\r\n\r\nand university levels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, having nine months more to go before the new\r\n\r\nmillennium comes, would the Ministry seriously consider  setting\r\n\r\nup  Social Services 21 and identify urgent service gaps  whereby\r\n\r\ngrassroots    social    service   professionals    could    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and  propose an integrated  programme  for  the\r\n\r\nsector?   This could help minimse some of the frustrations  felt\r\n\r\nby VWOs, earlier mentioned by Dr Michael Lim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that social work development is a critical\r\n\r\ncomponent  in our overall perspective of managing and  enhancing\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion in Singapore.  As we invest huge  resources  in\r\n\r\ntraining and retraining of workers in the manufacturing  sector,\r\n\r\nwe  must  continue  to also adopt a development  perspective  by\r\n\r\ninvesting  resources  on  short-term  strategies  and  long-term\r\n\r\nprogrammes in professionalising the social services delivery.  I\r\n\r\nhereby support Dr Vasoo's call for more allocation for MCD.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as\r\n\r\nwe step into the new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmillennium,  we are likely to face the impact of a new  economic\r\n\r\nsystem.   With globalisation, regionalisation and the challenges\r\n\r\nof  the  new information technology, how are we going to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  social cohesion of our multi-racial society?  What type  of\r\n\r\nchanges  can be expected in our family lives? How do we  sustain\r\n\r\nand   pass   on  our  traditional  values  from  generation   to\r\n\r\ngeneration?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt our social and legal structures are very good.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  need  to  instill some kind  of  catalyst  in  our\r\n\r\nfamilies  and society to strengthen human bonding, ie,  to  make\r\n\r\nour  families  and society more humane, and also  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nfamily ties and friendship among our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we participate in nation building, it is the duty of\r\n\r\nevery  one  of  us, first, to keep our families in  good  order.\r\n\r\nEvery one of us should play a part in it.  There is a saying  in\r\n\r\nHainanese  to the effect that if you have money, you  contribute\r\n\r\nmoney.  If you have strength, you contribute your strength.   If\r\n\r\nyou  have  no  money  and no strength, you just  donate  aerated\r\n\r\nwater.    In  the good old days, provision shop owners  may  not\r\n\r\nhave  the money to donate or time to spare, but they had  plenty\r\n\r\nof soft drinks or \"aerated water\", as it was then called.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear our friends complain that the CDC has not\r\n\r\ndone  enough, or that the voluntary organisations have not  done\r\n\r\nenough.   It  is  easy to point an accusing  finger  at  others.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when we ask our friends to take part in the activities\r\n\r\nof   these  organisations, they would say, \"I am very  busy.   I\r\n\r\nhave  to  work overtime.  I have to look after my  children.   I\r\n\r\nhave  to go for training, etc.\"  But if we look at it seriously,\r\n\r\nif  everyone can contribute, say, one or two hours in a week, or\r\n\r\nat  least  in a month,  to participate in social work,  it  will\r\n\r\nmake a lot of difference.  In other words, since they can afford\r\n\r\nto  play  9-hole or 18-hole of golf every week, borrow  so  many\r\n\r\nvideo  tapes  to  watch, or  watch so many TV programmes,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure they can arrange their time and set aside a few hours\r\n\r\nto do social work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the family as the fundamental building block of\r\n\r\nsociety.  Because of very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbusy  work schedule or other commitments, our parents,  brothers\r\n\r\nand  sisters may not have met even once in a year.   So  we  can\r\n\r\nstart, first of all, from the family activities.  Whenever there\r\n\r\nis  a function or some celebration, we have to eat.  So, why  do\r\n\r\nwe  not  take  the  opportunity to eat together?   We  can  also\r\n\r\nobserve the various religious or cultural rites and rituals.  If\r\n\r\nwe   are  not  restricted  by  our  religious  beliefs,  we  can\r\n\r\nparticipate  in activities in the churches, mosques or  temples.\r\n\r\nWe  can also participate in the various cultural activities.  We\r\n\r\ncan  also   visit  our  relatives during the  Chinese  New  Year\r\n\r\nperiod.  Nowadays, we are quite used to celebrating the  various\r\n\r\nfestivals together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, participation in community organisations. Now, we\r\n\r\nhave  CCCs,   RCs, CCMC, Senior Citizens' Clubs,  Youth  Groups,\r\n\r\nWomen's  Group  and all that.  We have the whole  set  up.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  is  whether  or  not  we  have  the  time   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in their activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise is that when we\r\n\r\nparticipate,  of  course, it is best  if  we  can  do  it  on  a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  basis.  But we can also set up a points  system  with\r\n\r\nthe help of the computer.  In Japan nowadays, some townships are\r\n\r\nalready  adopting the points systems where the organisers  would\r\n\r\nrecord  the  number  of  hours a person  participates  in  their\r\n\r\nactivities.   These  points would be  accumulated  to  give  him\r\n\r\ncredit  for  any  service  that he may require  in  future.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if he needs to go to a day-care centre, he will  enjoy\r\n\r\npriority  or concessions if he has accumulated a certain  number\r\n\r\nof  points  through  his previous voluntary  services  rendered.\r\n\r\nThis  will serve as a form of reward for his past contributions.\r\n\r\nOf course, the reward is not  the ultimate objective, but a sort\r\n\r\nof   encouragement  or  incentive.   Perhaps,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development could consider adopting this points system\r\n\r\nto  encourage and reward the voluntary welfare officers, so that\r\n\r\nsocial  service will become a norm rather than an  exception  in\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, we are all pursuing the 5 Cs. But we should also\r\n\r\npursue the 6th C,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich is community work.  In the old days when we had the family\r\n\r\nplanning  campaign, there were advertisements with catch-phrases\r\n\r\n: \"Boy or girl, two is enough\" or \"More children less to share\".\r\n\r\nIn  our society now, everybody wants to live a good life.  Maybe\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Community Development should start  a  \"Family\r\n\r\nLife  Planning\" campaign along this line.   We should reach  out\r\n\r\nto  the  people.   We  should  teach  our  people  how  to  live\r\n\r\nharmoniously   with  their spouses,  how to live  together  with\r\n\r\ntheir  families and neighbours, and how to enjoy the company  of\r\n\r\ntheir friends of different races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, we criticise our younger people and tell them\r\n\r\n\"You must not do this, you must do that.\"  But, in fact, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  doing  what we preach. We should set an example  ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe  Japanese say, \"You are a mirror to your children\".   So  we\r\n\r\nhave to teach by example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day Dr Aline Wong was talking about AIDS. In\r\n\r\nAmerica  there are certain sects which say that they   can  have\r\n\r\ncasual  sex  so long as they use condoms.  But I tend  to  agree\r\n\r\nwith   Mr  Bernard Chen.  He said that we must set  the  example\r\n\r\nourselves.   AIDS can be prevented so long as you do  not   have\r\n\r\ncasual  sex.   We must inculcate in our youths the right  values\r\n\r\nand  moral  obligations to do what is right and to  avoid  doing\r\n\r\nwhat is wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that when the year 2000 arrives, we can be fully\r\n\r\nprepared,  on  the  one  hand, to enjoy the  economic   benefits\r\n\r\nbrought about by high technology and, on the other hand, provide\r\n\r\nmore  comprehensive \"Life Education\" and \"Family Life  Planning\"\r\n\r\nto  our people, so that everyone will become active participants\r\n\r\nin  our family and social activities; everyone will optimise our\r\n\r\n\"human  bonding\" to make Singapore a more humane,  friendly  and\r\n\r\ncompassionate society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in his Chinese New\r\n\r\nYear  message,  Prime Minister Goh mentioned the  importance  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding.   In  this current economic  recession,  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore have demonstrated the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportance of community bonding as they go along with the  cost-cutting  package  to save our economy.  In one heart,  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to make sacrifices for the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community bonding does not come by itself. It has to be\r\n\r\ncultivated   through  education  and  nurtured  through   active\r\n\r\nparticipation in grassroots activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how to enhance our community bonding, I have the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In the various constituencies in Singapore, we have\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels of grassroots organisations.  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nmany  people would know how many grassroots organisations  there\r\n\r\nare   in  our  constituencies.  Nowadays, we  have  often  heard\r\n\r\npeople  talking about their aspirations to have  5Cs or  6Cs  in\r\n\r\nlife. .  In my constituency there are 12Cs - the CCC, CCMC,  RC,\r\n\r\nWEC, YEC, CSC, CDEC, CDC, SCEC, MAEC, IAEC and NC.  Yes, we have\r\n\r\n12   different   kinds   of  grassroots  organisations.    These\r\n\r\norganisations are actively organising all sorts of activities to\r\n\r\nbond  our people together and in the process build up our social\r\n\r\ncohesion. When I speak to our young people about kampong spirit,\r\n\r\nthey  find  it  to  be  a  very abstract concept.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the meaning of kampong spirit.  When  I  asked  them\r\n\r\nwhether they have the spirit of solidarity, they understand.  So\r\n\r\nwe   must  find  some  different  ways  to  educate  our   young\r\n\r\ngeneration.   If we can bring all these grassroots organisations\r\n\r\ntogether  to  build a \"Unity Circle\", it will  help  to  further\r\n\r\nenhance  our community bonding.  We can also build our  national\r\n\r\nbonding.   If the People's Association can give some  incentives\r\n\r\nor  awards, like what we  have been doing in companies and  work\r\n\r\nplaces  to  encourage our workers to enhance their  productivity\r\n\r\nand  efficiency. I hope the Minister will consider some kind  of\r\n\r\nincentive schemes for such activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When the National Day Parade is held at the National\r\n\r\nStadium,  because  of  the  limited  number  of  seats,  we  can\r\n\r\naccommodate  only a small portion of  the people  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndirect TV telecast, it is like watching a football match on  TV.\r\n\r\nThe   viewers  cannot  feel  the  atmosphere  in  front  of  the\r\n\r\ntelevision  set.  National Day is a most important  day  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry's calendar.  To enable all our people to take  part  and\r\n\r\nto  inculcate  patriotism  in  them,  I  suggest  that  all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies  in  Singapore organise their  own  National  Day\r\n\r\nParade  or at least a National Day Observance Ceremony, so  that\r\n\r\nmore people can come forward and be part of the  celebration  of\r\n\r\nour National Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the past, at our National Day Parades, apart from\r\n\r\nthe  programme at the parade ground, there were also processions\r\n\r\nof  uniformed groups marching into the city and to  the  various\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.   This will enable  our  people  to  feel  the\r\n\r\nfestivity  of  our National Day.  I hope in future National  Day\r\n\r\nParades,  there  could  be  displays  of  some  of  our  defence\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  weapons, to strengthen our people's  confidence\r\n\r\nin our defence capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, could you take your two topics \"Role\r\n\r\nfor the future\" and \"Eldercare\" together?

Only through\r\n\r\ngood  foresight and fast planning will the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment (MCD) stay relevant in the new era.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MCD should serve as a centralised body in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  effect  a coordinated plan towards  care  of  the\r\n\r\ngenerally  well  elderly.  Care of the  elderly  is  no  more  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of simply providing necessities like food and lodging.\r\n\r\nCare of the elderly is about quality of life provided through  a\r\n\r\nholistic  approach  or total care concept of  catering  for  the\r\n\r\nphysical, social and mental aspects of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of our elderly, 95% of them in fact, are\r\n\r\nambulant and in reasonably good health. Only 5% of them  require\r\n\r\ninstitutional  care  either  because  they  are  disabled   from\r\n\r\nillnesses,  or because they are too frail.  Our aim,  therefore,\r\n\r\nis  to try and keep the 95% of elderly who are \"relatively well\"\r\n\r\nremain  happy  and healthy.  Programmes need to be  revamped  to\r\n\r\nachieve these targets.  The success of these new trends of  care\r\n\r\nwill  not only make our elderly happier and healthier, but  they\r\n\r\nwill also:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) reduce the burden on many family members who would\r\n\r\notherwise have to look after the elderly themselves; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) benefit the nation through reduction on use of high\r\n\r\ncost care in the healthcare institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development should just focus on\r\n\r\nthe ambulant and relatively well elderly and leave the dependent\r\n\r\nelderly  to  the  Ministry of Health.  Sir, I believe  that  MCD\r\n\r\nshould go this way in order to stay even more relevant and  cope\r\n\r\nwith the changing social trends and changing demographic profile\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to go on to my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an increase in the life expectancy of our\r\n\r\npeople  now  to about 80 years in age.  The majority of  elderly\r\n\r\nwill  now  have  about 20 years more to live  after  retirement.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very much the resultant effect of modern  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Sir, to most of the elderly folk, the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  rather  than longevity becomes the issue that  matters  to\r\n\r\nthem.  It will be good, therefore, to revamp our system so as to\r\n\r\nenable  quality  living  for  our  elderly.   The  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development could aim towards  promotion  of  quality\r\n\r\nlifestyles so that as many elderly can stay happy and healthy in\r\n\r\nthe community for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we set certain broad\r\n\r\nguidelines to achieve our objective:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Promote positive attitudes towards ageing through public\r\n\r\neducation  targeting a change of mindset in both the  young  and\r\n\r\nthe old in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Help the elderly to be engaged within the community for as\r\n\r\nlong  as  possible.  This can be achieved by  (a)  getting  them\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  neighbourhood CARE (Centres of  Activity  for\r\n\r\nRetired  and  Elderly); (b) encouraging a buddy-system  type  of\r\n\r\ncaring  for  each other; (c) involving them in new hobbies,  and\r\n\r\n(d)  getting  the various voluntary care groups  coordinated  in\r\n\r\ntheir efforts.  Ideally, every constituency should have at least\r\n\r\none of such centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Limit and delay the onset of disabilities in old age, which\r\n\r\nmore  often  than not are due to diseases.  It is  important  to\r\n\r\nhave  healthy lifestyles and preventive healthcare.  Watch their\r\n\r\ndaily  food intake, ensure them daily exercises, and  give  them\r\n\r\nenough  mental  stimulation.   All these,  together  with  early\r\n\r\ndetection and treatment of diseases, will dictate the numbers of\r\n\r\nthe sick dependent elderly in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide financial, personnel and logistical support to\r\n\r\nachieve   our   aim.    The   MCD  should   support   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  non-profit  organisations  and  other  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups run CARE.  A lot of people may have the interest but they\r\n\r\nneed  the  know-how and the financial help.  Providing care  for\r\n\r\nthe   elderly  can  be  rather  expensive  because  the  elderly\r\n\r\nfrequently  do  not  have enough funds when  they  retire.   The\r\n\r\nelderly,  as  a socio-economic group, also do not  get  much  in\r\n\r\nterms of priority for their well-being and general care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Provide elderly-friendly features in their habitat to\r\n\r\nenable  them to stay for as long as possible in their own homes.\r\n\r\nHere, the MCD can help by providing the information, the advice,\r\n\r\nand the expertise to those who need the help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we succeed in this area of\r\n\r\neldercare.   It will be a big task because we are  expecting  to\r\n\r\nhave  about  one million sixty-plus citizens by the  year  2030.\r\n\r\nThe MCD would have succeeded in this area if the quality of life\r\n\r\namongst  the  elderly  has  been  improved  and  the  number  of\r\n\r\ndependent  elderly  has been reduced.  The rewards  for  society\r\n\r\nfrom the multiple effects of good health, quality lifestyle, and\r\n\r\nless  expensive healthcare will be enormously significant.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI urge the MCD to prioritise this area and make good eldercare a\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I move on to my last cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, for six years, Mr Lee Tan Lim (not his\r\n\r\nreal  name), aged 96, faced a wall of silence from his son,  his\r\n\r\ndaughter-in-law and their three children.  For  six  years,  his\r\n\r\nwife  was  slapped on the wrists each time she failed to  follow\r\n\r\nher  daughter-in-law's orders.  They fended for themselves  with\r\n\r\nmoney  saved  from  \"hong  bao\" given  by  their  daughters  and\r\n\r\nfriends.  They bought their own food and paid for their  medical\r\n\r\nexpenses  with money they have saved.  Their son and his  family\r\n\r\nabused this elderly couple in both emotional and physical terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate response from most people would probably be\r\n\r\nthat  the  aforesaid  is a rare and unusual  situation.   Is  it\r\n\r\nreally   that   rare  and  unusual  though?    Statistics   from\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts  show  that  one  out  of  every  34  police\r\n\r\nprotection order (PPO) applications filed here between  1st  May\r\n\r\n1997 and 30th June 1998 is from a parent.  It works out to be 86\r\n\r\ncases.  According to Tsao Foundation's Hua Mei Mobile Clinic,  a\r\n\r\nnon-profit  organisation devoted to the care and  well-being  of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly, they see about 10% of \"elderly abuse\" patients  in\r\n\r\ntheir  practice.  Research has found that almost one out  of  26\r\n\r\npeople  aged  60  and above in the United States  is  an  abused\r\n\r\nperson.   Studies  in Japan show that those most  vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nabuse are in the over-75 age group, and the most common type  of\r\n\r\nabuse is neglect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that \"elderly abuse\" is a silent tragedy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  because most people shy away  from  making  their\r\n\r\nproblems  known.   In Singapore, \"elderly abuse\"  is  definitely\r\n\r\nunder-reported.   It  is  Asian  culture  to  cover  up   family\r\n\r\nproblems, to avoid being stigmatised and to spare themselves  or\r\n\r\ntheir  families from public embarrassment.  The other reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  the present generation of elderly is also a \"hardy  breed\"\r\n\r\nand  some  do  not see such behaviour as abuse.   Sir,  \"elderly\r\n\r\nabuse\"  can  be  physical,  with injuries;  psychological,  with\r\n\r\nanguish  and emotional trauma or material, with neglect  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly who are left with no comforts, funds or resources.  Tell-tale  signs  of  abuse  would  be  poor  hygiene,  malnutrition,\r\n\r\ndehydration, unexpected injuries, depression, physical  as  well\r\n\r\nas social isolation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not treat \"elderly abuse\" as a non-existent\r\n\r\nissue.  We need a national effort in tackling this problem.  The\r\n\r\nlaw,  Part VII of the Women's Charter, has been amended in  1997\r\n\r\nto  address the relevant provisions for the protection of abused\r\n\r\nparents.   The Ministry of Community Development could spearhead\r\n\r\nthe next move by:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) making concrete plans and creating a body to promote\r\n\r\npublic awareness of \"elderly abuse\"; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) coordinating the activities of various organisations,\r\n\r\nincluding  hospitals, voluntary organisations, social and  legal\r\n\r\nservice  providers, as well as programme and  research  resource\r\n\r\ncentres to facilitate assistance to the abused elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is of paramount importance that a civilised country\r\n\r\nlike ours does not turn a blind eye to this social ill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, according to the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations, the number of people aged over 60 will increase\r\n\r\nfrom the present 550 million, or 10% of the world population, to\r\n\r\n1.2  billion, or 14% in 2025.  Singapore society is also rapidly\r\n\r\naging.  Projections are that our proportion of the aged, defined\r\n\r\nas persons aged 60 and above, will increase from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  10%  to  26.1% in 2030, or one in every  four  persons.\r\n\r\nThis  makes  Singapore the fastest aging society in Asia,  after\r\n\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of this demographic change will be pervasive.\r\n\r\nThe  needs  of  the  elderly  in the areas  of  the  employment,\r\n\r\nfinancial  security, healthcare, community support  and  housing\r\n\r\nwill  be  all  the  more  accentuated  and  urgent.   The  aging\r\n\r\npopulation  will not be an issue which just concerns our  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  and the families but every aspect of our society.   As\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  grow  to  be an even  larger  portion  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation, we must ensure that senior citizens are able to lead\r\n\r\nmeaningful  and fulfilling life in their own age.   Family  ties\r\n\r\nmust be strengthened so that this becomes the primary source  of\r\n\r\nsupport for senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that senior citizens are able to live\r\n\r\nproductive  and  active  life so that they  continue  to  be  an\r\n\r\nintegral  and  contributing  part of  society.   Employers  must\r\n\r\nrecognise  that senior citizens can be as productive as  younger\r\n\r\nworkers  can,  particularly in a knowledge-based  economy.   The\r\n\r\nretail  industry must make available accessories and  implements\r\n\r\nthat  can  help the elderly remain independent.  Developers  and\r\n\r\ntown  planners  must  make home and public  facilities  elderly-friendly.  Together, all sectors of our society must prepare for\r\n\r\nan aging population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has realised the need to prepare for\r\n\r\nthe  challenges of an aging population.  In October it set up  a\r\n\r\nhigh-powered   Inter-Ministerial   Committee   on   the    Aging\r\n\r\nPopulation.  May I ask the Minister what progress has been  made\r\n\r\nso  far?   In  preparing  the master plan  of  service  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  I hope the Government can take into consideration  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  needs  of different groups of senior  citizens.   The\r\n\r\nneeds of the senior citizens in the next millennium will be very\r\n\r\ndifferent from those of the senior citizens that we know  today.\r\n\r\nThey  will be healthier, better educated with bigger and  buying\r\n\r\npower because of CPF savings and investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government in its deliberations does not just\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  material  well-being  but  also  consider   the\r\n\r\nspiritual  and  intellectual  well-being.   Keeping  busy,  both\r\n\r\nphysically and mentally, is important for senior citizens' well-being.   There should be opportunities for many of  them  to  go\r\n\r\nback  to  school to study subjects of interest which they  could\r\n\r\nnot  pursue  in  their younger days due to the need  to  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving.   Along  this  line of life-long learning,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can consider setting up a Senior Citizens University.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aged must not be seen as a problem. They present\r\n\r\nopportunities  and challenges and these must be  identified  and\r\n\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the trend of an aging\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore has already attracted our attention.  By\r\n\r\nyear  2030, 20% of our population will be above the age  of  60.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  we cannot wait until it happens before  we  do  our\r\n\r\npreparation work.  We must immediately make all plans  to  cater\r\n\r\nfor this situation.  Recently we have set up a Committee to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  aged.  Although this is a new organisation,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  when the Minister formulates any policy, he would  consult\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots organisations of the various constituencies  and\r\n\r\ncollect  more  feedback from the ground.   Only  then  will  the\r\n\r\npolicies they formulate be more relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people grow older, their mobility will become more and\r\n\r\nmore  difficult.  For those who live far away from the community\r\n\r\ncentres, they will have problems getting there.  However, in our\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, we have one Residents' Committee in  every  10\r\n\r\nblocks.  So can I suggest that the MCD work out some plans  with\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  National Development  to  set  up  a  Senior\r\n\r\nCitizens' Corner or Senior Citizens' Club near every RC  centre,\r\n\r\nso  that  our RC members can look after the senior citizens  and\r\n\r\nencourage them to participate in the activities of the  RC.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we can prevent the old folks from being cut off  from\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, 85% of the population live in HDB estates.\r\n\r\nRecently,  I  heard  from the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nthat he was going to reduce the prices for studio apartments for\r\n\r\nsenior citizens.  That is a piece of good news.  But even  then,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot ensure that every senior citizen could afford to  buy\r\n\r\nthis studio apartment.  While we are considering the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  senior  citizens,  the Government  should  also  study  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  power  of  the  senior  citizens  for  these  studio\r\n\r\napartments.   Perhaps some of these senior  citizens  could  not\r\n\r\nafford to buy the studio apartments. Will there be other ways to\r\n\r\nhelp them purchase these apartments?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are always talking about moving towards a knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy  where the emphasis is on  high-tech industries.  We all\r\n\r\nknow  that  when the senior citizens get older, their memory  is\r\n\r\nnot  so good and they may not be able to react so quickly to the\r\n\r\nchanging  technology.  So on the one hand, we  want  to  develop\r\n\r\nhigh  technology, but on the other hand, we must  also  consider\r\n\r\nthat  with our aging population, more and more people  may  have\r\n\r\nproblems  coping with advanced technology.  I think we  have  to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are studying the problems of our senior citizens,\r\n\r\none  important  point is their mental health.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nthings which senior citizens could do but younger people cannot.\r\n\r\nSo  when  we are setting the rules, we should also consult   the\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens, because if we leave it all to the young people\r\n\r\nto  plan the activities for the senior citizens, it may  not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate.  Of course, we have just started this Committee  to\r\n\r\nstudy  the  problems of the elderly. I hope  that  when  we  are\r\n\r\nplanning   future activities, we should have more  consultations\r\n\r\nwith  our  grassroots leaders and the Committee members  of  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Citizens' Club.  Only then, can we come out with  better\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans  which  are relevant  to  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nTarmugi):    Sir,  before  I  reply  to  the  specific   Members'\r\n\r\nquestions,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlet me acquaint the House with how MCD is positioning itself for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past week in this House, several Members have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  about whether we are doing  enough  to  help\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers and their families.  Let me  assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  and  the  community  will  help   these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans get back on their feet.  The present safety net  is\r\n\r\nadequate  and  there are many existing schemes offered  by  MCD,\r\n\r\nvoluntary and community organisations to help retrenched workers\r\n\r\nand  their  families who are in financial difficulties.   Should\r\n\r\nthe  situation  worsen and we need more funds, my Ministry  will\r\n\r\nnot hesitate to request for supplementary budget.  But, Sir, the\r\n\r\nbest  approach, as has been mentioned quite often today  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  week,  is  to  equip them with the  necessary  skills\r\n\r\ncontinually,  so  that they remain employable and  are  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have also noted that we must look beyond\r\n\r\nthe  current  crisis, to address broader trends  and  challenges\r\n\r\nwhich could unravel our social fabric.  My Ministry shares these\r\n\r\nconcerns  and  has  repositioned itself to meet  the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complex demographic and socio-economic trends are reshaping\r\n\r\nour  society.  We must anticipate and manage the risks that they\r\n\r\nbring.   Instead of dealing with social problems downstream,  we\r\n\r\nmust  proactively  shape the nature of  the  society  we  desire\r\n\r\nupstream.  We need to build and accumulate social capital to see\r\n\r\nus  through  the ups and downs on our journey to make  Singapore\r\n\r\n\"Our Best Home\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can we do this? My Ministry will pursue three\r\n\r\nstrategic  thrusts  to  enable each  and  every  Singaporean  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to our social capital.  We must:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Support and strengthen the traditional roles of the\r\n\r\nfamily in care giving and inculcating values in our young;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Anticipate and prepare for an ageing population; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Build up a dynamic and vibrant people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD has restructured itself to provide focus and direction\r\n\r\nto deal with these new challenges.  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening the Family</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, strategic thrust in strengthening the family.\r\n\r\nSociety  cannot  be strong if the family is  weak.   Today,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  family, though basically healthy, is under increasing\r\n\r\npressure.   You  are  familiar with the  trends  -  dual  income\r\n\r\nfamilies,   increasing  nuclearisation  of   families,   smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies,  rising  divorce rates, rising  juvenile  delinquency.\r\n\r\nParents  do  not  spend enough time with  their  children.   The\r\n\r\nextended  family is in retreat.  This has led to an  erosion  of\r\n\r\nthe  traditional  role  of parents and the  extended  family  in\r\n\r\nshaping the character and values of their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD is taking a proactive and developmental approach to\r\n\r\ndevelop programmes to inculcate family values and provide social\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to support families.  Our approach  is  two-fold,\r\n\r\ndeveloping  our  \"heartware\" through family life  education  and\r\n\r\nbuilding up the \"community infrastructure\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family life education is three-pronged: helping couples\r\n\r\nstrengthen  their  marriages,  imparting  parenting  skills  and\r\n\r\ninculcating  family  values.  And MCD's family  life  programmes\r\n\r\nwill  equip  couples, parents and the young with the values  and\r\n\r\nthe skills for healthy family living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy families need strong community support to help them\r\n\r\nmanage  the many competing demands and pressures of urban  life.\r\n\r\nWhile the family has primary responsibility for care-giving,  it\r\n\r\nshould have access to good and affordable care options for their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry reviewed its child care policy. We\r\n\r\nwill  develop more child care centres, improve the standards  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  manpower and provide more  help  to  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Sir, my Ministry will review Family Service\r\n\r\nCentres  and  Before-and-After School Care  Centres  to  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir effectiveness and increase supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Anticipating the Ageing Population</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to our second strategic thrust, which is\r\n\r\nto  prepare  for the unprecedented ageing of our society.   With\r\n\r\nthe number of older Singaporeans set to triple by 2030, the baby\r\n\r\nboom  of the 1950s and 1960s will now become the seniors'  boom.\r\n\r\nWe  must plan ahead to minimise the potential downsides and even\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on the opportunities that an ageing population  will\r\n\r\nbring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues of our ageing population demand focused\r\n\r\nattention,  coordinated  action  and  creative  solutions.    My\r\n\r\nMinistry  recently  formed the Elderly Development  Division  to\r\n\r\nprovide focus and direction to MCD's role as the lead Government\r\n\r\nagency on ageing issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also review existing programmes for the\r\n\r\nelderly  with  a view to developing a five-year services  master\r\n\r\nplan  for the years 2001 to 2005.  We want to strengthen  public\r\n\r\neducation, help the elderly to lead active and fulfilling  lives\r\n\r\nand  develop  a  strong, well coordinated network of  community-based services to support the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the\r\n\r\nAgeing  Population,  chaired by Mr Mah  Bow  Tan,  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications,  with  Mr Yeo Cheow Tong and  myself  as  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairmen,  was  formed last October to set national  directions,\r\n\r\nand  to  ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach  across\r\n\r\nthe   public,   private  and  people  sectors.   MCD's   Elderly\r\n\r\nDevelopment Division will coordinate the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nIMC's recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing the People Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the third strategic thrust, that of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  people sector.  A vibrant  and  dynamic  people\r\n\r\nsector  is an important pre-requisite for community bonding  and\r\n\r\nnation  building.   When  people  come  forward  to  serve   and\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the community, they develop a sense of belonging,\r\n\r\nownership  and  national identity, in other words,  the  \"social\r\n\r\nglue\" that bonds Singaporeans.  My Ministry's new Community  and\r\n\r\nSocial Sector Development Division will promote and nurture  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of the people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key initiative is to establish a national body to promote\r\n\r\nvolunteerism  as a way of life in Singapore.  I would  elaborate\r\n\r\non this later.  It will be a promotional and resource centre for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  corporations who  want  to  be  part  of  the\r\n\r\nvolunteer   movement.   It  aims  to  increase  the   level   of\r\n\r\nvolunteerism  in all areas - social service, the  arts,  sports,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will work with the VWOs and community organisations to\r\n\r\nidentify  and  implement  new social services,  improve  service\r\n\r\ndelivery,   set  appropriate  standards  and  provide   manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment and training programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people sector to take a quantum leap forward, it\r\n\r\nhas to attract strong and able leaders.  Like the private sector\r\n\r\nand  also the public sector, the people sector too must have its\r\n\r\nshare of top talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I have described are MCD's new initiatives in the\r\n\r\narea  of  community  development.  When Singapore  first  gained\r\n\r\nindependence,  the  social challenges facing  us  were  stark  - racial  tension,  communal  strife,  poverty  and  unemployment.\r\n\r\nThese  problems  have largely been addressed.   Today,  the  new\r\n\r\nsocial  challenges facing us are far more complex  and  no  less\r\n\r\nconsequential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House, we must deal with these new\r\n\r\nchallenges  as decisively and as wisely as the first  generation\r\n\r\nof  Singapore leaders.  What I have sketched out for you so  far\r\n\r\ntoday, is my Ministry's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napproach  to  address these challenges.  We believe that  social\r\n\r\ncapital   is   accrued   by  developing   socially   responsible\r\n\r\nindividuals, building strong, stable families and by fostering a\r\n\r\ncaring and compassionate community.  By working together,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that we can achieve these desired outcomes and build a\r\n\r\ncohesive and resilient society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now address the specific questions raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.   Dr  Vasoo  and  Mr  Ahmad  Magad  asked  whether   an\r\n\r\ninstitution would be formed to promote and develop volunteerism.\r\n\r\nIn  October last year, I mooted the proposal for a national body\r\n\r\nto  promote  volunteerism as a way of life  in  Singapore  at  a\r\n\r\nseminar  organised by the IPS.  When I mooted  the  proposal,  I\r\n\r\nasked  for suggestions and feedback on how the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\nnational organisation could be facilitated.  I believe  that  Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad  Magad  and Dr Vasoo are referring to such an  institution\r\n\r\nwhen  they suggested the creation of a body to work out  schemes\r\n\r\nto   encourage   volunteerism  and  inculcate  the   spirit   of\r\n\r\nvolunteerism among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS conducted a survey in January this year and focused\r\n\r\ngroup    discussions   last   month   among   volunteer    youth\r\n\r\norganisations.   Members may be pleased to know that  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen a lot of interest in support of the proposal to have a body\r\n\r\nto promote volunteerism more widely among Singaporeans.  It will\r\n\r\nbe  a  resource  and  information centre  that  will  facilitate\r\n\r\nnetworking  and encourage more people to volunteer by  providing\r\n\r\ninformation  and advice on volunteer opportunities with  further\r\n\r\nconsultancy for volunteer initiatives.  The centre will  provide\r\n\r\ntraining  and  research  and develop good  volunteer  management\r\n\r\npractices.  It will serve both the volunteers and the  volunteer\r\n\r\nuser organisations.  The body will be volunteer-driven.  But the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not let it flounder because it  will  give  its\r\n\r\nsupport and the resources required, especially to start it off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang asked about improving our social service\r\n\r\nsector.  Two events have marked the increasing significant  role\r\n\r\nthat social workers are playing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  first  was the tea hosted by the President of Singapore  at\r\n\r\nIstana  last  year, as the Member has mentioned in  her  speech.\r\n\r\nThe  second  was the launching of the Outstanding Social  Worker\r\n\r\nAward,  singling out those with distinctions in the  service  to\r\n\r\nthe  profession, the community and the public.  The  Member  was\r\n\r\nalso involved in this project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for both professionals and volunteers is\r\n\r\nimportant.  In the past year, MCD organised specialised training\r\n\r\nfor  the  sector  in  the  areas of  child  abuse  and  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.  These are specialised courses.  At another  level,\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  Directors  of agencies  attended  a  first  ever\r\n\r\nDirectors' seminar of the sector in October last year.   Earlier\r\n\r\nthis  year, the staff in the social sector also began the  post-graduate  diploma  in  social work.   These  courses  were  over\r\n\r\nsubscribed.   I am told that 133 people vied for  the  first  50\r\n\r\nplaces  in  the  post-graduate courses and  the  rest  would  be\r\n\r\ntrained   in   subsequent  courses.   There  was  training   for\r\n\r\nvolunteers,  and MCD organised two workshops last year,  one  in\r\n\r\nMay and another in November, which were jointly organised by IPS\r\n\r\nand  the NCSS.  In December last year, MCD, together with  NCSS,\r\n\r\nalso launched two handbooks on volunteerism.  One is a guide for\r\n\r\nvolunteer coordinators to emphasise guiding principles  in  good\r\n\r\nvolunteer management.  The other is a handbook on motivating and\r\n\r\nsustaining volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look into ways to professionalise the social\r\n\r\nservice sector and ensure that we get the top people to join the\r\n\r\nsector  so  that they can give better service to the public.   I\r\n\r\nwas  told  that in the US, in fact, MBAs join the people  sector\r\n\r\nand  they  give  the kind of quality, push and  drive  that  the\r\n\r\npeople sector requires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked for more funds. By the way, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Dr  Vasoo  and also Mdm Claire Chiang for their  spirited\r\n\r\nappeal for more funds for my Ministry from the Finance Ministry.\r\n\r\nI agree with Dr Vasoo that the VWOs should focus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  on  providing service and looking after the needs  of  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged Singaporeans rather than spend too much  time  and\r\n\r\neffort  in  raising  funds.   Fund  raising  by  itself  is  not\r\n\r\nundesirable,  and I am sure the Member would agree,  because  it\r\n\r\ncould  tap  on  donors  who prefer to give  to  their  favourite\r\n\r\ncharities  and educate the public on worthy causes  to  support.\r\n\r\nIt  also  rallies the community effort and creates a rich  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund raising by charities has been affected with the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic downturn.  But it is heartening also that  some\r\n\r\nagencies  are still successful in their fund raising efforts  by\r\n\r\norganising novel and creative activities and events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Health Care for the\r\n\r\nElderly has recommended a review of the Government subvention to\r\n\r\nVWOs.   This  takes  into consideration  the  growth  in  social\r\n\r\nservice  required because of our rapidly ageing  population  and\r\n\r\nthe  lower  ratio of working persons per elderly in the  future.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry  will  be working with the Ministry  of  Health  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  on this recommendation.  The Members can be  assured\r\n\r\nthat we are addressing the funding requirements of our VWOs, and\r\n\r\nthe   IMC   will   also  be  looking  into   this   issue   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I carry on, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is one more minute left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Can I stop here then?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.
