It is indeed\r\n\r\ntragic  that a constitutional crisis should  have\r\n\r\narisen  so  early  in  the life  of  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment. Some people say that the  crisis  was\r\n\r\nbrought  about by my Party's desire to  patch  up\r\n\r\nthe  differences  within our Party  by  offering\r\n\r\njobs  as  Assistant Ministers to Members  of  the\r\n\r\nParty.  Nothing  is further from  the  truth - that\r\n\r\nthere  is  any  split in the Party.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nnatural  for  our opponents to fabricate  stories\r\n\r\nand impute sinister motives towards us -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have already overruled any\r\n\r\nreference  to  the  merits  or  demerits  of  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  Assistant  Ministers.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMember for Rochore please keep away from it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang:</b> This is the first time in\r\n\r\nthe    history   of   Singapore   that    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people have been called to\r\n\r\nshoulder the responsibilities of government,  and\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  claim that our Party is  overflowing\r\n\r\nwith  talent  and  sufficiently  experienced   to\r\n\r\nshoulder  such responsibilities. It is  therefore\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  if  we  are  to  achieve   self-government  within  a  set  time-limit,  as  many\r\n\r\npersons as possible in the early stages should be\r\n\r\nafforded  the  opportunity to acquire  experience\r\n\r\nand  knowledge which would enable them to run the\r\n\r\ngovernment   independently  in  time   to   come.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would observe that to make the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution workable and to prove the  sincerity\r\n\r\nof  Her  Majesty's Government in its oft-repeated\r\n\r\nassurance that we would be given self-government,\r\n\r\nthe   constitution  should  be   interpreted   as\r\n\r\nliberally as possible, and it should also be made\r\n\r\nas  flexible as possible. Above all, there should\r\n\r\nbe  a  spirit of compromise in the event  of  any\r\n\r\ndifference   of  opinion  arising   between   the\r\n\r\nGovernor  and  the  Council of Ministers.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore unfortunate that His Excellency  should\r\n\r\nhave  adopted an adamant attitude on such a minor\r\n\r\nissue as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   appointment   of  junior   Ministers,   and\r\n\r\nprecipitated a constitutional crisis.  It  is  of\r\n\r\nparamount importance that we should make it clear\r\n\r\nonce   and  for  all  as  to  who  governs   this\r\n\r\ncountry - that  is,  the Governor  or  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  people.  It   will   be\r\n\r\nmeaningless  to  claim that it  is  the  people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  who govern, if their  advice  is\r\n\r\nrejected and their efforts thwarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that this controversy has at least one\r\n\r\ngood  effect. It has made the colonial Government\r\n\r\ncome  out of its shell and to admit publicly that\r\n\r\nit  was not their intention to grant rapid  self-government to the people of Singapore.  This  has\r\n\r\nexposed their hypocrisy. Self-government  is  one\r\n\r\nof  the  main platforms of every political Party,\r\n\r\nnot only in Singapore, but also in every colonial\r\n\r\nterritory in the British Empire. However,  it  is\r\n\r\nour  Party,  and our Party alone, which  had  the\r\n\r\ncourage and foresight to announce that it was our\r\n\r\nintention to achieve self-government within  four\r\n\r\nyears.  If  we  hope for self-government  without\r\n\r\nfixing  a  definite date for achieving  same,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  tantamount to hoping for the moon.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  achieve anything, either in our  personal\r\n\r\nambitions or in politics, unless we fix our  goal\r\n\r\nand work according to schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While vested interests are happy over the\r\n\r\nGovernor's statement in this respect, the man-in-the-street  is  doubting  whether  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment are genuine in their promise to  grant\r\n\r\nus self-government. If we are wrong in hoping for\r\n\r\nself-government within four years, let them  tell\r\n\r\nus,  in  no  unmistaken terms, when we  would  be\r\n\r\ngranted independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Twentieth Century no civilised nation\r\n\r\nwould  like  the  idea  if  being  subjected   to\r\n\r\nanother,  and I ask for a clear-cut statement  on\r\n\r\nthis  point.  I am amazed to hear  from  my  hon.\r\n\r\nFriend Mr Sutherland that there are thousands of\r\n\r\nAsians in this island who have little to complain\r\n\r\nof  under  colonial rule. It shows the narrowness\r\n\r\nof   his   sphere  of  acquaintance.   Being   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  himself and a representative  of  the\r\n\r\nvested  interests in the bargain,  he  cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpected to, and would not climb down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom his pedestal and mix up with the man-in-the-street to obtain his views on the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, for one, would grant that we owe a lot to the\r\n\r\ncolonial power in the same way as we are grateful\r\n\r\nto   the  pioneering  Chinese  and  Indians  who,\r\n\r\nthrough  their  sweat  and  toil,  built  up  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  of Singapore and Malaya. We  are  not\r\n\r\nhostile  towards  the British, and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason  why  we should not continue  on  friendly\r\n\r\nterms  with  them even after we have  gained  our\r\n\r\nself-government or independence. Colonialism  has\r\n\r\nhad its usefulness, but the time has come when we\r\n\r\nmust  demand what is our birthright - the right  to\r\n\r\ngovern ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in all territories under the jurisdiction of\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom Government, Britain holds the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  answering  to   the   United\r\n\r\nNations  and the world at large for their affairs\r\n\r\nand administration. That is the reason why in the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of every British non-self-governing\r\n\r\nterritory the final say in the administration  is\r\n\r\nvested with the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you examine the constitution of Singapore and\r\n\r\neven  more  advanced territories  like  the  Gold\r\n\r\nCoast,  you  will  find  that,  wherever  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  that  the Governor, before  taking  any\r\n\r\naction,  should consult a Minister, or  even  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Council of Ministers, the final say  rests\r\n\r\nwith  the  Governor. It is only when there  is  a\r\n\r\ntransfer  of power granting independence  to  any\r\n\r\nhitherto  dependent territory that you find  this\r\n\r\nreserved power of the Governor eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Party has already made it quite\r\n\r\nclear that it is in full agreement with the first\r\n\r\nand  second parts of this motion. The third  part\r\n\r\nseeks to place an interpretation which will have\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  removing some of the  Governor's\r\n\r\npowers  and  of  having  the  final  say  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of this country. If  such  powers\r\n\r\nare, in fact, to be taken from the Governor, then\r\n\r\nwe   shall  have  the  position  of  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  remaining responsible and  answerable\r\n\r\nto  the  world at large for the affairs  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  at the same time deprived  of  the\r\n\r\npower of being the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nultimate   authority  over  some   administrative\r\n\r\nmatters.  It  is  therefore logical  that  if  we\r\n\r\ndemand  such powers, then we must be prepared  to\r\n\r\nshoulder all consequential responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone in which this debate has been\r\n\r\ncarried on, it is obvious that many, in fact  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Members of this House, are of the\r\n\r\nview that we should now demand that whenever  the\r\n\r\nGovernor should consult the Chief Minister, and a\r\n\r\nfortiori  the Council of Ministers, the  Governor\r\n\r\nshould  not  have the final say. That  being  the\r\n\r\ncase,  let us be honest about it. Let us not  ask\r\n\r\nfor these very far-reaching powers without having\r\n\r\nto  shoulder the resulting responsibilities.  The\r\n\r\ndemand for these far-reaching powers without  the\r\n\r\nconsequential  changes in the constitution  would\r\n\r\nresult  in  our  having the powers while  Britain\r\n\r\nretains  the  liabilities. Let us therefore  play\r\n\r\nthe game, and ask for a full transfer of power so\r\n\r\nthat  we, and we alone, shall be responsible  for\r\n\r\nour  own  affairs  and destiny and  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment need no longer be answerable for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the principles which I have\r\n\r\nstated, I therefore move an amendment, which will\r\n\r\nnot  only  be in line with the first  and  second\r\n\r\nparts  of this motion, but also remove all future\r\n\r\noccasions  for dissatisfaction. I therefore  move\r\n\r\nthat   the  motion  be  amended  by  adding   the\r\n\r\nfollowing new part between parts three  and  four\r\n\r\nof the motion:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And that in the opinion of this House the time\r\n\r\nhas  arrived  for a transfer of  power  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that a new constitution  providing\r\n\r\nfor independence should he granted immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am not a politician. I  could\r\n\r\nnot  survive  even  one year in  the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty.

I find it extremely difficult to imagine  that\r\n\r\nwithin  the space of three days a Party,  which  has\r\n\r\nstood  against more power being given to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, could, in all sincerity, come and say that\r\n\r\nthey would wish Her Majesty's Government to transfer\r\n\r\nall  the Governor's powers to the Chief Minister and\r\n\r\nhis colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said that he is not a\r\n\r\npolitician.  Sir,  if he were,  he  would  not  have\r\n\r\naccepted this amendment. He would have let it go  on\r\n\r\nthe original motion as it stood, for having moved an\r\n\r\namendment  to  minimise  the original  motion,  they\r\n\r\nwould have given us the singular privilege of seeing\r\n\r\nthem  vote for that motion. There were three  things\r\n\r\nthey  could have done on that original motion - either\r\n\r\nvote  for;  vote  against; or  abstain.  They  could\r\n\r\nhardly  have voted for, because they have  moved  an\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now we have the most astonishing spectacle of\r\n\r\nseeing  the  Progressive Party  being  the  fiercest\r\n\r\nParty of us all! They are the people, the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar has said it bold and clear, whose cry  is\r\n\r\n\"We want independence now!\" When the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  said these things, the world trembled because\r\n\r\nthey  thought that if these people got in, then they\r\n\r\nwould  do what they said they were going to do.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  the Member for Paya Lebar said it, I can quite\r\n\r\nimagine the hon. Mr Sutherland being quite unmoved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will have to accept this amendment because\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister has moved it. If he had not been\r\n\r\nsuch a political innocent, he would have forced this\r\n\r\nissue  as  it  stood  and  we  would  have  had  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of seeing the four Progressive  gentlemen\r\n\r\nvote  against that motion, if they had the  courage;\r\n\r\nor  abstain, if they had not the courage. Be that as\r\n\r\nit  may,  they hope - it is still not certain yet - that\r\n\r\nthey can go back to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  and  say, \"We went to the Assembly  and  we\r\n\r\nsaid  to  the  Chief Secretary (Mr Goode)  that  we\r\n\r\nwanted   independence  now.

If  it\r\n\r\nis of any assistance to the Member for Paya Lebar, I\r\n\r\ncould  give him some of the scripts of the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party's views in the past on this  topic  of\r\n\r\nindependence.

The Progressive Party was the  one  which\r\n\r\nwent   before   the   electorate   and   said,   \"We\r\n\r\nbelieve\" - (the  Straits  Times  gave  it   tremendous\r\n\r\nprominence, and I am sure it must have pleased  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland  very  much) - \"in slow, orderly  peaceful\r\n\r\ngovernment.

The Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  are anxious to attach a name to what  would\r\n\r\nalready have been the substance in any case.  What\r\n\r\ndo  they  mean by \"immediately\" I do not  know.  I\r\n\r\npresume  they do not expect a new constitution  to\r\n\r\nbe  written  tonight and published  tomorrow,  but\r\n\r\nthey will no doubt accept that \"immediately\" means\r\n\r\n\"as soon as possible\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I hope that we have, with this last\r\n\r\namendment, reached the end of the party strife and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre, because this is a matter which  should\r\n\r\nrise far above personal and party feelings. As the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister opened the debate  on  Friday,  he\r\n\r\ninformed  the Opposition that the Party  Whip  had\r\n\r\nbeen  withdrawn,  and he invited  all  Members  to\r\n\r\nspeak   and  to  vote  in  accordance  with  their\r\n\r\ninnermost convictions. I hope that from now on all\r\n\r\nwill  do  so. I hope all have done so so far.  But\r\n\r\nalthough the Chief Minister did his best to secure\r\n\r\nthat  we  should be free from party strife,  there\r\n\r\nwere and there have been a number of bitter words,\r\n\r\nimputations   and   recriminations,   which   have\r\n\r\ncompelled  you, Mr Speaker, to intervene  and  to\r\n\r\nremind  us  continually of  the  Standing  Orders.\r\n\r\nMembers  have  gone beyond what is permissible  in\r\n\r\nthis  chaste Assembly, and as a result  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen some confusion of the constitutional issue. I\r\n\r\nwish  to stress again that the importance of  this\r\n\r\nconstitutional issue lies finally in the fact that\r\n\r\nwe  are  all substantially agreed on it. If  there\r\n\r\nwas  real  disagreement in this House,  the  issue\r\n\r\nwould  be dead, or at least would have to be  kept\r\n\r\nin  cold  storage until you could get  substantial\r\n\r\nunanimity   in   the   people   and    in    their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. But since all are agreed, then we\r\n\r\nshould  all speak and vote in unity; vote  loyally\r\n\r\nto  give effect to the wishes of the people;  give\r\n\r\neffect  to our own innermost convictions.  But  to\r\n\r\ntry to reap party advantage on this occasion, to\r\n\r\ngive  vent  to  personal  ill-feeling,  bears  the\r\n\r\nappearance   of   indescribable  small-mindedness.\r\n\r\nTomorrow   there  will  be  a  proper   and   full\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  all  the bitterness,  the  party\r\n\r\nstrife,   the   rancour, the   manoeuvres, the\r\n\r\nimputations, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmisrepresentations,  in  which  some  Members  are\r\n\r\nhappy to indulge. But today can we not all join to\r\n\r\nput  forward  together the cause of  freedom,  the\r\n\r\ncause  of self-government, on which we all  agree?\r\n\r\nAnd  if  today is no time for party bitterness,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  it is also no time  for  expressing\r\n\r\nbitterness against the Imperial power, or  against\r\n\r\nthe  representatives of the Imperial power in this\r\n\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This sounds like moral rearmament!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is rather more practical than\r\n\r\nmoral rearmament. We have in the world today three\r\n\r\nmajor  world groupings. You have, to the north  of\r\n\r\nus,  what  the  geo-politicians call  the  \"heart-land\",     which    is    controlled    by     the\r\n\r\nCommunists - Russia,  China and  their  dependencies\r\n\r\nand  subordinate  bodies.  You  have,  across  the\r\n\r\nPacific,  the  United States of America  with  its\r\n\r\ndependencies  and  its dollar diplomacy;  and  you\r\n\r\nhave,  away on the west of us, the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand around us the Commonwealth of Nations. And  as\r\n\r\nthe  world is today, no small territory can  stand\r\n\r\nalone. We are a small territory. We shall still be\r\n\r\nsmall  when  we  have  achieved  union  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation. We cannot stand alone. We  shall  have\r\n\r\nto  associate  ourselves with one of  these  major\r\n\r\nworld  groupings. And if a choice has to be  made,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  doubt in my mind  that  the  choice\r\n\r\nshould fall on the Commonwealth of Nations. I  say\r\n\r\nthis  without  prejudice to what I hope  we  shall\r\n\r\nachieve  in  the future - which is a  fourth  major\r\n\r\nworld  grouping,  which  would  extend  from   the\r\n\r\nHimalayas to the South Pacific, to include so many\r\n\r\nnew  and  free nations and peoples, and  which  we\r\n\r\nhope  could  rise above the greeds and jealousies,\r\n\r\nrivalries, disputes and war and folly, which  have\r\n\r\ndisgraced the history of the great Powers  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  But that is over the horizon of the  future\r\n\r\nstill, and for the time being this territory  will\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice but to go with one of  the  three\r\n\r\nmajor  world  groupings  that  I  have  named.

In comparing  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  to  a  bee,  I  felt  it  was  most\r\n\r\nappropriate  because the bee is  such  an  energetic\r\n\r\nfellow.  With  incessant  energy  he  continues  to\r\n\r\naccumulate  honey,  not  for  himself  but  for  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  others.  Moreover,  the  bee  is,  when\r\n\r\nattacked,  armed with a sting with which he  can  do\r\n\r\ndamage!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Friday, the Chief Minister argued - and I\r\n\r\nfelt  with very great force and cogency - that in  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the constitutional document  the\r\n\r\nword  \"may\"  is  directive and not permissive.  This\r\n\r\npoint seems to present some difficulty, perhaps,  to\r\n\r\nsome Members of this House, and certainly elsewhere,\r\n\r\nand if people are unconvinced, I would suggest that,\r\n\r\nfor  the purposes of argument, I shall pass  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister's  array of legal  authorities,  his\r\n\r\npicul  or  so of calf-bound tomes which  he  brought\r\n\r\nwith him in case they were needed, and I will grant,\r\n\r\npurely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  purposes of argument, that in this  matter  His\r\n\r\nExcellency has certain discretionary powers. I  will\r\n\r\nproceed  to  examine what is then  the  position  if\r\n\r\nthose   powers,   in  fact,  are  rightly   in   His\r\n\r\nExcellency's control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote as my first authority Professor\r\n\r\nBarriedale  Keith. His textbook - the British  Cabinet\r\n\r\nSystem - is,   I  believe,  a  reasonable   work   of\r\n\r\nreference  which  is accepted as  an  authority.  He\r\n\r\npoints  out  that when a British Colony  adopts  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Cabinet  system - as  we  are  doing  here - it\r\n\r\nnecessarily  adopts also the fundamental  principles\r\n\r\nand  practice of the British Cabinet system. And so,\r\n\r\nif we can accept Professor Keith as being right - and\r\n\r\nobviously  he  must be because you  cannot  adopt  a\r\n\r\nmodel  of  democracy without adopting the principles\r\n\r\nwhich  have produced that model - if he is  right,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  examine  the principles on  which  we  are\r\n\r\nhoping to proceed. Our attention has been very  much\r\n\r\nfixed  on  one major principle, which  is  that  the\r\n\r\nSovereign,  or  in  this territory  the  Sovereign's\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  should act on  the  advice  of  his\r\n\r\nMinisters   when  it  is  formally  and   officially\r\n\r\ntendered  to  him through the Chief  Minister.  That\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I  think,  is clear  to  everybody,  and\r\n\r\nnobody  has  any  difficulty  or  doubt  about   the\r\n\r\nstatement of the principle. Where the difficulty and\r\n\r\ndoubt  has come, at least in His Excellency's  mind,\r\n\r\nis whether that principle should be applied here and\r\n\r\nnow. My object is to show that it can and should  be\r\n\r\napplied, without hesitation and without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quote, in support of that, another\r\n\r\nprinciple  which is equally fundamental and  perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  far-reaching: a principle which  can  best  be\r\n\r\nstated  by  saying  that the  constitution  must  be\r\n\r\nflexible.   It   must  have  flexibility   and   the\r\n\r\npossibility of adaptation to things as they  change.\r\n\r\nIn  Britain,  there is no written constitution.  You\r\n\r\nhave  various  fixed constitutional points  such  as\r\n\r\nMagna Carta or the Bill of Rights, or the Parliament\r\n\r\nAct of 1911, or the Habeas Corpus Act, which can  be\r\n\r\ncalled  constitutional documents, but  they  do  not\r\n\r\namount to a written constitution. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  far as they have any effect, their effect  is\r\n\r\nto  give more freedom and more liberty of action.\r\n\r\nThey do not restrict people in any way, except to\r\n\r\nrestrict  the  power  of the  Executive  to  some\r\n\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commonwealth of Nations also has no written\r\n\r\nconstitution. The whole British system  is  based\r\n\r\non the fact that you deal with situations as they\r\n\r\narise,  and  you  do  not tie  yourself  down  in\r\n\r\nwriting  to  an  intention which you  cannot,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   carry  out  because  the  situation   has\r\n\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do have in the United States of America a\r\n\r\nwritten  constitution, and they get into quite  a\r\n\r\nmess  with  it  sometimes. My little  reading  in\r\n\r\nAmerican  history  has indicated  that  they  get\r\n\r\nconflicting  interpretations  according  to   the\r\n\r\npolitical  colour  of  the country  at  different\r\n\r\ntimes.  There is a fairly long time  lag  between\r\n\r\nchanges,  and  certainly in  Singapore  we  have\r\n\r\nalready got into some difficulty with our written\r\n\r\nconstitution. It is precisely because we  have  a\r\n\r\nwritten  constitution that we need this principle\r\n\r\nof  flexibility. It was inevitable that we should\r\n\r\nhave   a  constitution  written,  because  whilst\r\n\r\nelsewhere constitutions have grown up slowly over\r\n\r\na  long  period of time, here no opportunity  for\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress was made. If progress had\r\n\r\nstarted 50 years ago, we should now no doubt have\r\n\r\nconventions  instead  of a written  constitution,\r\n\r\nbut we have not. We have to cram into a few years\r\n\r\nthe  progress  that might well have  been  spread\r\n\r\nover half a century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I pass to my next authority. This is no\r\n\r\nmassive tome, but I received it some two or three\r\n\r\nmonths  ago  from  our worthy friend  the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations Officer. It is published by the Central\r\n\r\nOffice  of Information. The title is The Monarchy\r\n\r\nand  The Commonwealth, and it says on the  inside\r\n\r\ncover that this document is intended as reference\r\n\r\nmaterial   and   is  derived  from  authoritative\r\n\r\nsources  and  may  be freely  used  in  preparing\r\n\r\narticles,  speeches, broadcasts, etc. I  take  it\r\n\r\nthat  it is authoritative, because it comes  from\r\n\r\nan authoritative source, and I take it as being a\r\n\r\nreasonable and fair statement of what the British\r\n\r\nposition is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Constitutional conventions differ from strict\r\n\r\nlaw  in  that they are not recognised and applied\r\n\r\nby  the Courts\" - I know that some Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse wish them to be brought to the Courts,  but\r\n\r\nthey  did not appreciate the British approach  to\r\n\r\nconstitutional problems. They are not  recognised\r\n\r\nand applied by the Courts - \"but nevertheless they\r\n\r\nare   indispensable   and  lend   themselves   to\r\n\r\nadaptation to changing conditions without serious\r\n\r\ndisturbance to existing legislative forms. It was\r\n\r\nlargely  by  means  of the firm establishment  of\r\n\r\nsuch  conventions that in the course of centuries\r\n\r\nrestrictions were imposed on the use of the Royal\r\n\r\nprerogative  and that the powers  of  the  Crown,\r\n\r\nceasing  to  be at the personal disposal  of  the\r\n\r\nSovereign\" - or  in  Singapore  the   Sovereign's\r\n\r\nrepresentative - \"came to be the means  of  giving\r\n\r\neffect  to  the  wishes of the  people\".  I  will\r\n\r\nrepeat    the   two   key   portions   of    that\r\n\r\nquotation - \"adaptation  to   changing   conditions\r\n\r\nwithout    serious   disturbance   to    existing\r\n\r\nlegislative  forms\". We have changing conditions.\r\n\r\nThey  have changed rapidly. We do need to be able\r\n\r\nto  adapt to them. The Progressive Party has  now\r\n\r\nmade  it necessary, through their amendment, that\r\n\r\nwe should disturb the existing legislative forms.\r\n\r\nThe  point  is  not of any vital  importance,  it\r\n\r\nseems to me in this case, but, as far as it goes,\r\n\r\nthey  have  gone  somewhat  against  the  general\r\n\r\nspirit of democracy; but it does not matter  very\r\n\r\nmuch.  The other portion which I wish to  remind\r\n\r\nMembers  of is - \"powers of the Crown came  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  means of giving effect to the wishes of  the\r\n\r\npeople\". His Excellency is the representative  of\r\n\r\nthe  Crown,  and it is not unreasonable  to  hope\r\n\r\nthat the powers which he exercises now can, by  a\r\n\r\nsimple   constitutional   transference,   without\r\n\r\nserious   disturbance   of   any   sort,   either\r\n\r\nlegislative or any other kind, become  the  means\r\n\r\nof giving effect to the wishes of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it is necessary to argue\r\n\r\nthis  point  any further, but I think perhaps  it\r\n\r\nwill    be   useful   to   cover   briefly    the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of this, as it is quoted  in  this\r\n\r\nbooklet,  in  the  history of  Canada,  which  is\r\n\r\ncalled   the  senior  Dominion  of  the   British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.  Hon.  Members will  recollect,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  American Revolution where the Imperial power\r\n\r\nstood on its strict constitutional rights and, as\r\n\r\na  consequence, lost its American colonies  which\r\n\r\nnow  become the great and dollar - powerful  United\r\n\r\nStates  of  America, with whom we have,  happily,\r\n\r\nfriendly   relations.  That  gave   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment furiously to think, and at the end  of\r\n\r\nabout  70 years they had thought it all  out  and\r\n\r\nLord Durham went to Canada and produced in 1839 a\r\n\r\nReport  from which the future development of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth has grown. The effect of this Report\r\n\r\nwas  that although there were powers retained and\r\n\r\nreserved - powers of disallowance, surveillance and\r\n\r\nso  on,  which  were  retained  by  the  Imperial\r\n\r\nGovernment - they were not, in fact, used and  they\r\n\r\nwere  obsolete long before they were removed.  In\r\n\r\nother words, it was perfectly feasible under  the\r\n\r\nBritish practice to have powers, but not  to  use\r\n\r\nthem. The situation did not call for them. Canada\r\n\r\nwas   perfectly  competent  to  act  responsibly,\r\n\r\nachieving  economic  and political  independence.\r\n\r\nThe  principle  of flexibility was  applied,  and\r\n\r\nalthough  the  powers were there  they  were  not\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the Rendel Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission,  as  they  surveyed  the   field   of\r\n\r\nSingapore    with   conscientious   thoroughness,\r\n\r\nbrought to their study the full knowledge of this\r\n\r\nprinciple of flexibility, and they also  knew,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  that  in  the wrong hands  flexibility\r\n\r\ncould degenerate into flabbiness. They might wish\r\n\r\nthat  the  Governor should be strong, because  on\r\n\r\nsurveying  the Singapore scene at that time  they\r\n\r\nfelt  that there was a danger of flabbiness. They\r\n\r\nfelt  that  democracy was a  difficult  thing  to\r\n\r\ntransplant into this tropical climate. They might\r\n\r\nhave  had  in their minds the old quotation  from\r\n\r\nRudyard  Kipling that \"East is East and  West  is\r\n\r\nWest,  and never the twain shall meet\": and  they\r\n\r\nmight  have wondered whether, in fact,  democracy\r\n\r\ncould  be  transplanted  into  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of a few years - that fragile flower  might\r\n\r\nwilt  and droop, become flabby and might  need  a\r\n\r\nstrong gardener in the person of the Governor  to\r\n\r\ndrive in a stake and tie the plant to it so  that\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  stand  up,  until it had  gathered  enough\r\n\r\nstrength  to stand by itself. I am only assuming\r\n\r\nwhat  might have been in the minds of the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Commission, but I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  might  take note of the whole  of  what\r\n\r\nKipling said, because it is rather relevant.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  \"Oh,  East is East, and West is West, and \r\n\r\n    never the twain shall meet,\r\n\r\n  Till  Earth  and Sky stand presently  at  \r\n\r\n    God's great Judgment Seat;\r\n\r\n  But there is neither East nor West,\r\n\r\n    Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\r\n\r\n  When  two strong men stand face to \r\n\r\n    face, though they come from the ends \r\n\r\n    of the earth!\"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our situation today. We have two strong\r\n\r\nmen - His  Excellency and cur Chief Minister.  They\r\n\r\nhave come into conflict. They are grappling today\r\n\r\nin   a   constitutional  struggle,  and  in  that\r\n\r\nstruggle the great gap between East and  West  is\r\n\r\nabolished. It is brought together into  a  single\r\n\r\ndemocratic    process,   which,   as   democratic\r\n\r\nprocesses  do, is producing difficulties,  making\r\n\r\nthe  sparks fly; but out of it we see  this.  The\r\n\r\nstruggle  between His Excellency  and  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  is  a  clear  and  obvious  proof  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  has  taken strong  root  here  and  is\r\n\r\nalready  a real and vital political principle  at\r\n\r\nthe  very  heart  of  our  political  life.  This\r\n\r\nstruggle  would  not  have been  possible,  as  I\r\n\r\npointed  out before, if there was not substantial\r\n\r\nunanimity,  and  if the Chief  Minister  was  not\r\n\r\nrepresenting effectively the wishes of the people\r\n\r\nand  of the representatives of the people.  There\r\n\r\ncan be no question about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this struggle resolves itself, I think it\r\n\r\nwill  be  plain that Singapore has taken a  great\r\n\r\nstep  forward. We shall be grateful not  only  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister for fighting this battle, but\r\n\r\nwe  may well feel grateful to His Excellency  for\r\n\r\nhaving  provided  the occasion  for  the  battle.\r\n\r\nBecause  this  struggle  has  given  to  us   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of demonstrating to the whole  world\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore  no  longer  needs  to   receive\r\n\r\ndemocracy as a gift, but has taken democracy  and\r\n\r\nmade  it her own; is able to use it and live  it,\r\n\r\nand  fight for it, and to succeed in its practice\r\n\r\nand in the interpretation of its principles. This\r\n\r\nconstitutional struggle is nothing  new.  It  was\r\n\r\nforeshadowed in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery heavy poll at the time of the elections.  In\r\n\r\nspite  of  some ingenious simple arithmetic,  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains that the poll was extremely  heavy.\r\n\r\nThe electoral register contained numerous errors,\r\n\r\nand  although there may have been in theory  some\r\n\r\n300,000 potential electors, the actual figure was\r\n\r\nmuch   nearer  200,000  and  the  poll   was   an\r\n\r\nexceptionally   high  poll  for  any   democratic\r\n\r\ncountry, and an astonishing poll in a place  like\r\n\r\nSingapore   with  a  small  and  weak  democratic\r\n\r\ntradition.  If further proof of the  strength  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  here is needed, it has been  given  in\r\n\r\nthe  energy  and  vigour of the Chief  Minister's\r\n\r\nGovernment. His Excellency's powers to  prop  and\r\n\r\nshelter  the  flower of democracy are  no  longer\r\n\r\nneeded.  Where they should have been  a  support,\r\n\r\nthey are now an encumbrance, a hindrance, and  an\r\n\r\nobstruction to the free development, growth  and\r\n\r\nmovement  of  the  democratic  process.  We  need\r\n\r\nflexibility and not rigidity, and I would like to\r\n\r\nclose  by  quoting  to  the  House  what,  to  my\r\n\r\nastonishment, nobody has quoted so  far - Sir  John\r\n\r\nNicoll's words to this House on the 22nd of April\r\n\r\nin his Opening Address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have already had a most striking\r\n\r\ndemonstration of the realisation by the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  their  responsibilities  in   this\r\n\r\nmatter\"  (that  is  in  the  matter  of  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution). \"The General Election held earlier\r\n\r\nthis  month  showed that the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nunderstand  the importance of the  vote  and  the\r\n\r\nneed  for casting their votes in accordance  with\r\n\r\ntheir  convictions. It is now for the Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters and this Assembly as a whole to see  to\r\n\r\nit  that  the  popular  will thus  democratically\r\n\r\nexpressed is carried out. Let no man suppose that\r\n\r\nhe knows better than the Election results.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note I would like to end with these last\r\n\r\nwords: That out of this struggle, and out of  our\r\n\r\nultimate  victory in it, there  can  grow  a  new\r\n\r\nunity  of  the people of Singapore. We  can  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  a  period of useful  and  prosperous\r\n\r\nrelationships between His Excellency and all that\r\n\r\nhe  stands  for, and the Chief Minister  and  all\r\n\r\nthat he stands for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the issue before this House  is  an\r\n\r\nissue which involves not only the interpretation\r\n\r\nof  the  Order in Council, but also the sin-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncerity of the Colonial Office and, in particular, of the\r\n\r\nBritish   Government   towards   granting   self-government to this island. I wish Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  would  realise  the significance  and  the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  the situation. It is not  something\r\n\r\nwhich  could be treated with emotion or hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe  outcome  of this debate will  depend,  to  a\r\n\r\ngreat  extent, on whether or not this  Government\r\n\r\nis  capable of carrying out its proper  functions\r\n\r\nin a spirit of goodwill and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has pointed out on various\r\n\r\noccasions  that  there could be no responsibility\r\n\r\nwithout power. For three and a half months,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Coalition Government has had to face and  to\r\n\r\nsolve  problems  which would  do  credit  to  a\r\n\r\nSolomon.  Much against our will, but  because  we\r\n\r\nthought  it  was for the good of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  acquiesced  in  the  use  of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, and when criticisms  came\r\n\r\nthundering  in,  it  was not His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  nor was it the Hon. the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nwho  had  to face the music. It was the Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  who  was  responsible.  It  was   the\r\n\r\nCoalition Government who was the bad hat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Elected Members on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse,  have  never  shirked  our  responsibility\r\n\r\neither  to  the people of Singapore  or  for  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  good government. If  we  are  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible, I say, and I say it with conviction,\r\n\r\nlet  us  also share in the power which we firmly\r\n\r\nbelieve is embodied in the Order in Council. What\r\n\r\nis this power that we say is ours by right? Is it\r\n\r\nthe power to corrupt? Is it the power to destroy?\r\n\r\nNo, Mr Speaker, it is the power to enable us  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out our duties as responsible and  elected\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  the  people with  the  dignity  it\r\n\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members in this House have insinuated that\r\n\r\nthe interpretation of section 32 of the Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  was  the  interpretation  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister himself.

The\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  Mr  Speaker,  is  no  more  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the Chief Minister than  it  is\r\n\r\nmine.

The\r\n\r\nChief Minister, Sir, has clearly stated that this\r\n\r\nis  a  side  issue, and that he  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nreconsider   his  recommendation,   but   it   is\r\n\r\nimperative in the interests of the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, and in the implementation of\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's Government's oft-repeated  promise\r\n\r\nof  granting self-government, that section 32  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Colony Order in Council should  be\r\n\r\ninterpreted  in  a  manner in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of the Rendel Constitution; and this  is,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  in  so  far as domestic  matters  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  people's representatives  should\r\n\r\nhave  absolute  control. I am qualified  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  statement  because I was a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nRendel   Commission;  perhaps  I  am   the   only\r\n\r\nsurviving member of the Rendel Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the interpretation of section 32\r\n\r\nof the Order in Council, it appears that the whole\r\n\r\nquestion hinges on the interpretation of the word\r\n\r\n\"may\".  The Governor's interpretation is that  it\r\n\r\nconnotes the exercise of discretionary power, and\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister's interpretation is  that  it\r\n\r\nconnotes  the granting of authority to  exercise,\r\n\r\nwhich  authority  must  be  exercised  when   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  stated therein  arise.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has quoted legal authority  to  support\r\n\r\nhis  interpretation. Sir, I am not  a  lawyer  by\r\n\r\nprofession,  and I am therefore not qualified  to\r\n\r\ntouch  on the legal aspect in my contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe debate on the motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have stated on several occasions in the\r\n\r\nlast   Legislative  Council  that   the   English\r\n\r\nlanguage is indeed difficult to understand, and I\r\n\r\nfind  it  necessary in this present  instance  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what I said to illustrate the point.  Two\r\n\r\nfriends, Sir, a Frenchman and an Englishman, were\r\n\r\ntravelling in a train in England. When the  train\r\n\r\nwas approaching a tunnel, the Englishman shouted,\r\n\r\n\"Look  out!\"  The  Frenchman,  on  hearing   this\r\n\r\ncommand, looked out, and got soot all  over  his\r\n\r\nface.  He  turned round angrily to the Englishman\r\n\r\nand demanded an apology for having played such  a\r\n\r\ndirty  game  on  him.  The  Englishman  was  very\r\n\r\nsurprised,  but he felt sorry for the Frenchman's\r\n\r\nignorance of the English language. He, therefore,\r\n\r\nexplained  calmly to the Frenchman that  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  \"look  out\",  he meant \"look  in\".  So  the\r\n\r\nFrenchman  scratched his head and muttered,  \"You\r\n\r\nEnglish  are  a funny race. When you  mean  'look\r\n\r\nin',  why  do  you have to say 'look  out'?\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  English language  is  indeed\r\n\r\ndifficult to understand, and when \"look out\"  can\r\n\r\nmean  \"look  in\", surely \"may\" can mean  \"shall\"? [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is important to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  is not  how  the  Governor\r\n\r\ninterprets section 32, or how the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\ninterprets section 32. The deciding factor should\r\n\r\nbe - what is the popular interpretation? By this, I\r\n\r\nmean,  what is the interpretation of the for  the\r\n\r\nexpression of this interpretation amendment. With\r\n\r\nthat  amendment, Sir, constitution was  drawn  up?\r\n\r\nThe forum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis    in   this   Assembly,   by   the   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. We, who are gathered  here  this\r\n\r\nmorning, are the people's representatives, and we\r\n\r\nare  here  to  express the people's views,  their\r\n\r\naims, and their aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was at school, Sir, I was taught English\r\n\r\nhistory,  and I learned that when King Charles  I\r\n\r\nattempted to interpret the constitution according\r\n\r\nto  his will and not according to the will of the\r\n\r\npeople, he brought upon himself a fate which  we\r\n\r\nall  know.  The purpose of the motion before  the\r\n\r\nHouse   is  to  impress  on  Whitehall  to   take\r\n\r\ncognizance  of  the  will of the  people  through\r\n\r\ntheir   elected  representatives,   and   I   ask\r\n\r\nWhitehall  to  take  new heed.  The  debate  last\r\n\r\nFriday,  Sir,  has shown that there  are  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and elected representatives,  and\r\n\r\nI  hesitate to expand on this, because, even with\r\n\r\nthe privilege of this House in freedom of speech,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid I cannot find words apt  enough  to\r\n\r\ndescribe  what  I  mean by  the  second  type  of\r\n\r\nelected  representatives,  but  without  uttering\r\n\r\nthose words. Sir, I feel sure that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  know  what  they  are.  The  hon.

The\r\n\r\nissue  was very simple. We were asked to  express\r\n\r\nour  determination to rule ourselves.  No  wonder\r\n\r\nthere  was much moaning and wailing from some  of\r\n\r\nthem.  They  could no longer sit  on  the  fence.\r\n\r\nTheir  delicate constitutions could  not  stomach\r\n\r\nsuch an outspoken principle as self-rule. Yet, as\r\n\r\nelected representatives, they could not very well\r\n\r\noppose it. If they did, they would be exposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  public. They could not stand up and declare,\r\n\r\n\"We  shall  have none of it.\" That would  require\r\n\r\ncourage.

The\r\n\r\nChief Minister has not made a mountain out  of  a\r\n\r\nmolehill;  rather not even expecting a  molehill,\r\n\r\nhe  discovered a mountain, and when this mountain\r\n\r\nwas   discovered,  it  became  the  duty   of   a\r\n\r\ndemocratically  elected  representative  of   the\r\n\r\npeople's  House to put it before  the  House  for\r\n\r\ntheir  views. This he tried to do by  putting  in\r\n\r\nthis motion in the true and humble spirit of  one\r\n\r\nwho  has  dedicated himself to the cause  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But was he appreciated? No.  Fears  were\r\n\r\nexpressed  that  he might turn  dictator.  I  say\r\n\r\nshame, Sir. What a sad mutilation of facts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Progressives tried last Friday to amend\r\n\r\nthe  motion so that it would appear to the people\r\n\r\nthat  they supported the principle of the motion.\r\n\r\nYet  by  deleting the last portion of the motion,\r\n\r\nthey could then have the motion put on paper only\r\n\r\nas  an ideal that would remain on paper and which\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  put  into practice.  That  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  many of the ideals that  they  had\r\n\r\ntold  the  public  often  during  their  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns.    There   is    one    ideal    about\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, which was accepted by  them  long\r\n\r\nago, but  it  is  on paper and has  remained  on\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now when they found themselves cornered,\r\n\r\nthey have taken to the word \"Progressive\" with  a\r\n\r\nvengeance,  and  progress has  been  achieved  by\r\n\r\nleaps  and bounds during the week-end,  and  from\r\n\r\nthe  wailings and moanings about powers that  may\r\n\r\nbe taken away from the Governor, they have jumped\r\n\r\nto  an  ideal of independence and later  accepted\r\n\r\nself-government. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not, for\r\n\r\none moment, think that the people of this country\r\n\r\ncan be fooled by such tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

To me, Sir,  the  entire\r\n\r\nOrder  in  Council  is  inadequate  to  run   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  in the interests of the people.  Many\r\n\r\nof  its sections do not represent the true spirit\r\n\r\nof    the    recommendations   of   the    Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitutional Commission. I shall  try  to  give\r\n\r\nyou, Sir, a special instance. Paragraph 68 of the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution Report states as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We recommend that the method of appointment of\r\n\r\nthe  six  Elected Ministers, and  of  any  junior\r\n\r\nMinisters,    should    closely    follow     the\r\n\r\nconstitutional practice in the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nshould  be  as  follows. On  the  result  of  the\r\n\r\nelection  being known, the Leader of the  largest\r\n\r\nParty or Party group in the Assembly would become\r\n\r\nthe  \"Leader  of the House\", and  as  such  would\r\n\r\nexercise  many  of  the  functions  which   would\r\n\r\nnormally devolve on a Prime Minister in  a  fully\r\n\r\nself-governing  State.

Only\r\n\r\nmisguided   politicians   will   entertain    the\r\n\r\ntruthfulness of this kind of self-government.  We\r\n\r\nhave  heard  a similar declaration in respect  of\r\n\r\nIndia  a  few  years ago, and let us examine  how\r\n\r\ngradual self-government worked in India. In 1917,\r\n\r\nthe   United  Kingdom  Government  declared   the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  its future policy  towards  India.\r\n\r\nThis was the increasing association of Indians in\r\n\r\nevery  branch  of  the  administration  and   the\r\n\r\ngradual     development     of     self-governing\r\n\r\ninstitutions  with  a  view  to  the  progressive\r\n\r\nrealisation of responsible government in India as\r\n\r\nan  integral  part  of  the  British  Empire.  In\r\n\r\npursuance  of this policy, the Montague-Chelmford\r\n\r\nReport made recommendations for the setting up of\r\n\r\nnew  institutions  in the provinces  and  at  the\r\n\r\ncentre,  and these were, to a very large  extent,\r\n\r\nimplemented  in the Government of  India  Act  of\r\n\r\n1919,   which   considerably   increased   Indian\r\n\r\nparticipation  in the government.  The  franchise\r\n\r\nwas  widened,  the  provincial legislatures  were\r\n\r\nenlarged,  and  the  principle  of  diarchy   was\r\n\r\nintroduced.  Under  this  system,  Sir,  in   the\r\n\r\nprovincial government a number of portfolios were\r\n\r\nheld  by  Ministers  who sat  in  the  Governor's\r\n\r\nExecutive  Council, but were responsible  to  the\r\n\r\nLegislature,  while  other  portfolios  including\r\n\r\nfinance,  law and order were dealt  with  by  the\r\n\r\nofficials who were also members of the provincial\r\n\r\nGovernor's    Executive   Council,    but    were\r\n\r\nresponsible  to  the Governor and,  in  the  last\r\n\r\nresort,  to the Government of the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand not to the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the situation in Singapore today is like\r\n\r\nthat which existed in India thirty-six years ago.\r\n\r\nThe  promise of gradual self-government to  India\r\n\r\nin 1919 meant continual domination by the British\r\n\r\nGovernment  up  to  1947  when  independence  was\r\n\r\nrealised  by India - twenty-eight years  after  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  declared their policy.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  sort  of slow self-government  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  am  really  sad.  The  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially the freedom-loving  people,\r\n\r\nwould  expect a further and clearer statement  of\r\n\r\npolicy  on self-government from the Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  for  the  Colonies  when  he  arrives   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House today is a very\r\n\r\ntimely  reminder  to  the  Malayan  people   that\r\n\r\nindependence  is  not just a  ready-made  product\r\n\r\nthat will be imported into this country tax-free.\r\n\r\nIt should be won by the people by struggle and at\r\n\r\nthe  expense  of great sacrifice.

Let the people remember this day  as  a\r\n\r\nred-letter day in the history of our struggle for\r\n\r\nconstitutional  reform and  right.  Let  us  also\r\n\r\nignore the lone voice of a few reactionaries  who\r\n\r\nare    trying   to   enslave   our   people    by\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation of our political  goal.

I asked him one day why\r\n\r\nhe  did not advise his company to start a factory\r\n\r\nin Malaya instead of sending the raw materials to\r\n\r\nEngland,  eight thousand miles away. \"Do  not  be\r\n\r\nstupid,\"  he said, \"our tyres can still  sell  in\r\n\r\nMalaya, can they not?

True,   the    Governor    has\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers, but does that mean  we  are\r\n\r\nto  be  little children over whose decisions  the\r\n\r\nGovernor   can  over-ride  us  as   he   pleases?\r\n\r\nDoubtless,  he  has the welfare of  Singapore  at\r\n\r\nheart, but so has everyone else in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe,  as Assemblymen, do not seek the approval  of\r\n\r\nthe Governor only, but we have the well-being  of\r\n\r\nthe public in mind in whatever decisions we make.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we are the elected representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people in name only, in which case one  sees\r\n\r\nno  point  in being an Assemblyman.  If,  on  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   we  are  to  be   considered   as\r\n\r\nresponsible men, then our word should carry  full\r\n\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are fighting over the principle of the\r\n\r\nmatter.

When a matter is at issue, it  should\r\n\r\nbe  settled in the Assembly. Once that  stage  is\r\n\r\npassed,  there should be no hindrance,  unless  a\r\n\r\ndecision is outside our power. If a decision made\r\n\r\nis wrong, then those who form the Government will\r\n\r\nhave  to  answer for it. Are we to cater for  the\r\n\r\nwishes   of   the  Governor,  or   are   we,   as\r\n\r\nAssemblymen,   elected   by   the   people    and\r\n\r\nresponsible to the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his installation, not long ago, the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The principal instrument of policy is now the\r\n\r\nCouncil   of  Ministers;  the  Governor  acts   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the Council's  advice,  and  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  functioning of the Constitution  is  a\r\n\r\nburden which falls directly on the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, there are people who still do not\r\n\r\nunderstand adequately what is meant by the Council\r\n\r\nof  Ministers  responsible to a popularly  elected\r\n\r\nLegislature.  The  effect of its  introduction  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been  the transfer  of  power  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility from an external authority  to  the\r\n\r\nauthority of the people themselves. If, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  people, or a section of the people,  obstruct\r\n\r\nor frustrate the acts of the Government, then they\r\n\r\nare  challenging  what is no  longer  an  external\r\n\r\nauthority, but the authority for which  they  gave\r\n\r\nthe mandate at the recent elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  take  it  that  these  words  were  spoken  in\r\n\r\nsincerity and that they should be acted upon.

For  one frightening moment, I thought  he\r\n\r\nwas  going to follow the commercial logic of  his\r\n\r\ncolleague  in  the banking world. I  am  glad  he\r\n\r\nstood  up and spoke as a man of honour and  as  a\r\n\r\nMalayan, and I salute him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is only a simple question involved\r\n\r\nin this debate - whether the constitution should be\r\n\r\nconstitutionally interpreted, no more,  no  less.\r\n\r\nEven His\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcellency,  in  his message, never  suggested  that  an\r\n\r\namendment was necessary. All that he says is that what I\r\n\r\nask  of him is tantamount to an amendment, but, in point\r\n\r\nof  fact, there is no need for any amendment at  all  of\r\n\r\nthe constitution. I merely ask that it be interpreted in\r\n\r\na  spirit  of  goodwill,  in a spirit  that  takes  into\r\n\r\naccount the needs of the people and seeks to meet  those\r\n\r\nneeds in a proper fashion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Stamford (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy) put it\r\n\r\nsomewhat neatly when he said that I did not come here to\r\n\r\nmake  a  mountain  out  of  a  molehill,  but  not  even\r\n\r\nexpecting  a  molehill,  I suddenly  found  myself  slap\r\n\r\nagainst a mountain. It is not just section 32. There are\r\n\r\nmany  other  sections  in  this constitution  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  has to consult me, and the whole thing  meshes\r\n\r\nwith  this  very important issue: are we  to  have  self-government as rapidly as we are capable of achieving it,\r\n\r\nor are we going to have an interpretation which seeks to\r\n\r\nhinder, obstruct and delay self-government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in this House twenty-eight Malayans. I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to ask for a division, Sir, whatever we voice.  I\r\n\r\nshould like on this occasion, perhaps the first historic\r\n\r\ndebate  of  this Assembly, that we should stand  and  be\r\n\r\ncounted on the record for ever. As a Malayan, it  is  my\r\n\r\nhope  that,  irrespective  of personal  animosities  and\r\n\r\nantagonisms, irrespective of party politics, we will all\r\n\r\nstand  together in this assertion of our need for  self-government,  for the transfer of powers  in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner   to   the  people,  and  for  an  interpretation\r\n\r\ncompatible with the most rapid self-government possible.\r\n\r\nI  say to you fellow Malayans in this House that it  is\r\n\r\nmy  hope, it will be my privilege to stand side by  side\r\n\r\nwith whomsoever wishes to stand by me. I will disdain no\r\n\r\nvote. I will look down upon no man, however much he  may\r\n\r\ndislike me, who comes to the assistance of the people of\r\n\r\nthis  country  today in supporting  a  motion  that  has\r\n\r\nnothing  personal, nothing political, and nothing  party\r\n\r\nabout  it.

This is a letter addressed to\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, and I have had the permission of His\r\n\r\nExcellency to read it to the hon. Members.  So  I\r\n\r\ndo  not see how we can initiate a debate on  this\r\n\r\nletter.  It is a bit difficult, I know, but  that\r\n\r\nis the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If that is so, Sir, it may\r\n\r\nnot  be that the House may wish, but in the light\r\n\r\nof the comment contained in that second paragraph\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseems  to  confuse  the issue of  self-government\r\n\r\nwith  the immediate issue, it may well wish, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  seek  to  send  you on a further  mission  of\r\n\r\nclarification  and  no more  and  that  can  come\r\n\r\nwithin the terms of the original motion. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is in my mind at the present moment in  the\r\n\r\nlight of this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, I do feel that\r\n\r\na  matter  of  this nature it needs very  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration, and I do not think that  it  would\r\n\r\nbe quite fair to His Excellency to rush him for a\r\n\r\nreply in this matter. He has, as I said, read the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the Resolution as a whole, rightly  or\r\n\r\nwrongly,  and he wishes for time to consider  the\r\n\r\nwhole  matter very, very carefully, and  I  think\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  are entitled to have very  careful\r\n\r\nattention   paid   by  His  Excellency   to   the\r\n\r\nResolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.
