The economies of ASEAN and East Asia are all experiencing dynamic growth. India and Vietnam are also opening up. Leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC) held a successful informal meeting in Seattle in November 1993, and is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> planning the next one in Indonesia this year. Our region is set to play an expanding role in the international economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is prospering too. We enjoyed strong growth in 1993, and can look forward to further steady progress over the next few years. Our short term issues are well in hand. My Government_s focus is therefore on long term policies to position ourselves for the next stage of nation building. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In economics, one major thrust is to venture abroad, to develop trade and investment links with neighbouring countries, and tap the vitality and opportunities in a fast-growing region. We will promote a regional outlook among Singaporeans, and remove obstacles that hinder our entrepreneurs and companies from going offshore. Our advantage is that we are familiar with both East and West, with the region as well as the developed countries. By investing in the larger economies around us, we can link our prosperity with their dynamism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must upgrade our domestic economy, to avoid losing business to other countries with lower costs and more abundant resources. We need to invest in the education and training of our people, attract a steady flow of talent from abroad, master new technologies, and promote key industries in the manufacturing sector. This will make Singapore a strong base to support our efforts in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are restructuring our tax system to stay competitive. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) will come into effect on 1st April 1994. We will then reduce direct taxes in order to encourage enterprise. The comprehensive programme of offsets to the GST will protect the lower income groups, so that the new tax will not leave them worse off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's asset enhancement programme will enable every citizen to share the fruits of Singapore's success. The HDB upgrading programme will benefit the 90% of Singaporeans who own HDB flats. The interim upgrading programme will improve the relatively younger HDB estates which need more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> than routine maintenance. The sale of two- and three-room HDB rental flats to sitting tenants will enable even more Singaporeans to own their own homes. The sale of hawker stalls and HDB shophouses at a discount to sitting tenants will help hawkers and small businessmen to own rather than rent their commercial properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government paid $200 into the CPF accounts of Singaporeans who contributed at least $500 each themselves to their CPF savings, through the CPF Share Ownership Top Up Scheme. We also sold Singapore Telecom Group A Shares at a substantial discount to our citizens. These measures helped many Singaporeans take a direct stake in Singapore's economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telecom flotation was a resounding success. 1.4 million citizens bought Group A shares. Significantly, people are holding on to them as long term investments, instead of selling them immediately for quick profit. Other major privatisations will follow Singapore Telecom. The next likely one will be the PUB Electricity and Gas Departments in two to three years_ time. The Government will use these privatisations to enhance the assets of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are enjoying better health and living longer. But birth rates remain low, and the population is aging. These fundamental demographic changes have serious social and economic implications. We must adjust our policies to prepare for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longer life spans mean that people need to stay economically active longer, and retire later. Older workers will need retraining to learn new skills and fit into new jobs. So will those seeking to re-enter the workforce, for example, women who had previously stopped working to have children. The Skills Development Fund will expand retraining programmes for older workers to help them upgrade and adapt to new technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have passed legislation to raise the retirement age to 60. We will gradually raise it further, eventually to 67. However, we must do so gradually, to avoid \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> suddenly making the labour market inflexible, and to give employers time to adjust to new labour conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aging population will need to spend more on health care than a young one. We have established policies to contain health costs, keep high quality basic health care affordable, and avoid the problems besetting health care systems in developed countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must put aside enough for their old age. The CPF provides a sound foundation for this. The CPF Minimum Sum scheme, in particular, caters to members_ needs after they have retired. As people live longer, and as their standards of living rise, we need to revise this scheme to get members to set aside a larger Minimum Sum, beyond the normal annual adjustments for changes in the cost of living. A larger Minimum Sum will provide for a longer lifespan, and enable members to withdraw higher amounts each month after they retire at 60. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will raise the Minimum Sum gradually over a number of years. This way, workers who are now nearing 55, and have already planned on withdrawing their CPF balances in excess of the existing Minimum Sum, will only need to make small adjustments. But younger workers must start to make the full adjustment now. The Government will discuss the issue thoroughly over the next few months, and then decide on the best way to proceed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we had our first Presidential Election. We elected a President to safeguard the integrity of the civil service and protect our financial reserves. The elected President will make it harder for a government to go on a profligate spending spree, and squander our hard-earned reserves. But the elected President alone cannot guarantee our well being. Only the people can make sure that the government pursues prudent and responsible policies, by electing honest and competent Members of Parliament to form a good and clean government. For it is the government that creates the environment where people can generate wealth for themselves through enterprise, knowledge, skills and hard work. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's fiscal policy is to maintain a balanced budget. In good years, we will accumulate modest surpluses, to be held in reserve for economic downturns. Sooner or later we will face a recession like the short one we had in 1985, or like the prolonged current recessions in Europe and Japan. The surpluses will then enable us to reduce taxes appropriately in order to help business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should not increase subsidies just because revenues are healthy. Subsidies must be justified by desirable objectives of improving the self reliance or long-term economic independence, not dependence, of those helped by subsidies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not subsidise services which benefit only those individuals who use them, e.g. PUB utilities. We will subsidise services where there is a public good, and the benefit is enjoyed not just by the direct user but by society at large. Examples are basic health care, education, public housing and infrastructure. Even then, we will avoid across the board subsidies, but focus the most subsidies on those whose needs are greatest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also charge for at least part of the cost of subsidised services, even though only a small part, so that people will appreciate the value of the service and not waste it. Wherever possible, our welfare schemes depend on self-reliance and savings, and not just on government taxation and direct transfers of income. We encourage self-reliance of the family and the extended family, by allowing CPF top-up for parents and Medisave payments for family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also use part of its budget surpluses to fund asset enhancement programmes, like the CPF Share Ownership Top Up Scheme, and the Singapore Telecom Group A shares. Such programmes benefit the less well off proportionately more than the better off. However, they are not welfare schemes or entitlements. The Government can carry them out only so long as Singapore does well and accumulates healthy budget surpluses. Furthermore, the benefits must \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be related to effort. For example, under the CPF Share Ownership Top Up scheme, CPF members had to contribute $500 to their CPF accounts before they could receive the $200 grant. These conditions will prevent asset enhancement programmes from degenerating into a system of handouts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is to rely on the free market wherever possible, except where the free market does not work properly, for example, in health care. The free market matches supply and demand of goods and services through the price mechanism. It channels resources to where they are most needed and valued, and enables the economy to respond quickly and flexibly to constantly changing circumstances. People have the freedom to decide for themselves how to spend the money they earn, and take responsibility for their own choices, instead of having the government step in to spend their money for them. As a result, they have the incentive to give of their best. Free markets promote efficiency, enterprise and growth, as governments the world over have discovered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore, the free market is tempered by government intervention. The Government intervenes to give everyone equal opportunities and a fair start in life, and to provide a safety net of last resort to the small minority who need it. We do this although it reduces the incentive for Singaporeans to strive individually for themselves, because Singaporeans also need to cooperate with one another to build one nation together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed countries in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada once proudly called themselves welfare states. Now they have to \"revamp\" their welfare systems, in order to remedy the disastrous side effects of state welfare: like weakened family bonds, diminished incentives to work, and impoverishment of the country's finances. But turning back is slow and painful. Their problems confirm that we have chosen the right approach. We must stay with what has worked, and not follow the mistakes of others. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international environment is becoming more competitive. Fast growth in the region means more opportunities but also formidable challenges. Countries with abundant land, low wages, and hardworking, intelligent workers want to plug into the world economy. They will compete against us for exports and investments. To stay ahead, we must anticipate long term problems, and strengthen our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will to achieve and excel. Every citizen will have his or her stake in our common future. So long as we are prepared to learn and to work our best, we can continue to be ahead. But we need the cohesion and determination to excel. Then we will thrive and prosper. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Eight Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>THE SECOND SESSION OF THE EIGHTH PARLIAMENT ON MONDAY, 10 JANUARY, 1994</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR LIM HNG KIANG\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Acting Minister for National Development\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND will continue to improve the quality of the physical development of Singapore through rational far-sighted planning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Planning and Developing A City of Excellence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Ministry has revised the Concept Plan to provide a long-range blueprint for Singapore's physical development into the 21st century. The Plan safeguards sufficient land for housing, commercial, industrial and infrastructural developments to support our economic growth. It also sets aside land for recreation and other social amenities to give Singaporeans a better living and working environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To translate the Concept Plan into implementation plans for the medium term, URA will prepare Development Guide Plans (DGPs) for 55 local areas over the next five years. DGPs will provide a local perspective to the overall vision of the Concept Plan, showing clearly the development potential of specific areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will progressively release more State land for housing development by the private sector to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans. Similarly, we will make available State land for commercial and industrial developments to support our economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will embark on land reclamation works off the north-east coast and at Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, to provide land for future development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Asset Enhancement</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. HDB plans to build 27,000 - 30,000 new flats a year over the next three years to meet demand for public housing. It will increase the number of flats to be built under the Design-and-Build scheme to provide more choices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Main Upgrading Programme, to refurbish and improve existing flats in older housing estates to match the standards of newer estates, will be in full swing by 1994. The programme covers flats older than 17 years. HDB will announce, in batches, the precincts to be upgraded progressively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Government will fully fund an Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP) to complement the Main Upgrading Programme, so that more residents will enjoy the benefits of upgrading earlier. The IUP will enable Town Councils to carry out selected improvements for flats in the 10 to 17 years age band, which would otherwise have to wait more than eight years for their turn under the Main Upgrading Programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will implement measures to assist lower income families to own HDB flats. HDB has introduced smaller 4-Room flats with simpler finishes which are significantly cheaper than the standard 4-Room flats. We will introduce new schemes to help lower income families to buy 3-room resale flats. We will also look into helping tenants of HDB 2-and 3-room rental flats to buy over their flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. HDB will continue to offer shops for sale to allow more Singaporeans to own their shops in HDB estates. HDB will examine whether a similar scheme can be extended to sell industrial shops to sitting tenants. Many industrial estates, however, are not able to meet expanding needs for electrical power, higher floor loading and increased traffic circulation. Such estates will have to be upgraded or redeveloped before they can be sold. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Construction</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. CIDB will continue to improve productivity and quality in the construction industry through the promotion of buildable designs, developing and assessing quality standards in construction work, and training of the construction workforce. Its new training centre at Bishan will be operational by March 1994. CIDB will widen its range of training courses and trade tests for workers. It will also introduce new training courses for construction supervisors and managers. It will emphasize the use of modern construction technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Roads &amp; Buildings</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Over the next 5 years, PWD will spend $2 billion to expand the capacity of the road network. PWD will build 600 lane-km of new roads. This includes widening 16 existing roads and expressways and building 20 new major roads, 28 new interchanges, flyovers and underpasses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. To improve traffic flow without consuming more land, PWD will construct more underground roads to expand the road capacity in the Central Area. It will also extend the computerized traffic control system to new areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. PWD will continue to build more walkways and integrate them with the public transport system. It will complete the walkway upgrading programme in the Civic District by 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. PWD will design and construct $2.5 billion worth of Government buildings over the next five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Parks</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. PRD will develop 12 new parks and upgrade seven existing parks over the next five years. PRD will continue to develop more park connectors to link up major parks for Singaporeans to jog or cycle from one park to another. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. NParks will develop the Botanic Gardens into a premier equatorial botanic garden for botany and horticulture. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Primary Production</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. PPD will continue to ensure a stable and adequate supply of safe, wholesome meat, fish, fruits and vegetables in Singapore by diversifying sources of supply, and maintaining high standards of veterinary public health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. PPD will develop more agrotechnology parks to make efficient use of farmland. This will help Singapore become an agrotechnology service centre for tropical agriculture. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   DR LEE BOON YANG\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Labour\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour will vigorously promote a conducive environment for creating more and better jobs for Singaporeans. We will protect the safety, health and social security of our workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Labour Relations</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. We will work closely with employers, workers and unions to promote harmonious industrial relations and to enhance our international competitiveness. We will promote wider implementation of the flexible wage system to make the economy more responsive to international competition, and to reward workers for their contribution to productivity and profitability. Together with employers, unions and the Industrial Arbitration Court, we will implement the recommendations of the Flexible Wage System Review Committee appointed by the National Wages Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. We will review provisions of the Employment Act to keep them relevant in the changing business environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Efficient use of Manpower</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. We have raised the retirement age to 60 through legislation on 1st July 1993. Employers should invest more in training and skill upgrading of employees, particularly the older workers, to help them \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> improve their productivity and remain employable. We will review the tripartite part-time employment guidelines and consider formalising them as regulations under the Employment Act, in order to create more part-time employment, and encourage more economically inactive persons to join the workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Foreign Workers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. We will continue to allow a controlled pool of foreign workers to complement the domestic workforce and support economic growth. We will give preference to skilled and compatible foreign workers who may be suitable for assimilation. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. We will vigorously prosecute Singaporeans found illegally employing foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Industrial Health Safety</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. We will protect workers' health by preventing and controlling occupational health hazards and diseases. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. We will continue to encourage factories to adopt measures to enhance workers' safety, and prevent occupational health hazards and diseases. We will step up training for workers and supervisors on industrial safety and health. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. We will introduce more comprehensive safety and health requirements to protect workers in hazardous industries such as the shipbuilding and ship repairing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Social Security</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>10. We will extend the CPF Scheme to more self-employed Singaporeans by requiring all self-employed persons who renew or apply for licences after 1st January 1994 to be up-to-date in their Medisave contributions. We will encourage CPF members to provide for their retirement by buying life annuities with their CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. We will review the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme in the light of an aging population and lengthening life span, in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> order to increase the Minimum Sum and ensure that Singaporeans have sufficient savings for their old age. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. We will review the CPF Dependants_ Protection and MediShield Schemes to give more protection to CPF members insured under the Schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   DR RICHARD HU TSU TAU\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Finance\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Fiscal Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's fiscal and budgetary policies will continue to lay the basis for sustained, non-inflationary economic growth. They will promote a strong and dynamic private sector supported by an efficient and responsive public sector. They will strengthen national resilience, promote social cohesion and enhance the quality of life of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>2. The medium term budgetary objective is to achieve a balanced budget, with surpluses in good years to stimulate growth in lean years. All operating and development expenditures will be financed from operating revenues. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. \n  <i>Expenditures.</i> The major expenditures will be on investments in our future, i.e. education, health care, public housing, infrastructure and national security. The size of the public sector will be tightly controlled to free manpower for the private sector. Computerised cost information systems will be put in place in all ministries and departments, and more direct linkages established between budgets and outputs to cut waste and make public sector managers more accountable for their expenditures. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. \n  <i>Revenues.</i> The introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) on 1st April 1994 will be a major tax reform. The GST rate will be kept at 3% for at least 5 years. Tax on companies will be reduced to 27% to stimulate growth and improve the investment environment. Personal income taxes will also be lowered to encourage effort and enterprise. To offset the impact \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of GST on the lower income groups, a package of tax and non-tax rebates, grants and public assistance will be introduced.Nearly all households in Singapore will be better off after the GST is introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. We will continue to promote the external wing of the economy. Appropriate fiscal measures will be used to encourage Singapore companies and businessmen to trade and invest in the booming and growth economies of Asia. At the same time, we will help these companies to sink deeper roots into Singapore as they develop their overseas operations so as to prevent a hollowing out of our domestic economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Monetary Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6. Our exchange rate policy will continue to be to contain imported inflation, maintain price stability and support export competitiveness. Domestic inflation has declined from an average 3.1% per annum during 1989-91 to just over 2% per annum in 1992-93. Beyond the initial one-off effect of GST on prices, underlying inflation is not expected to pick up significantly in 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Regulatory Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. The hallmark of Singapore's development into a successful international financial centre has been the creation of a sound financial system with high prudential standards. We will maintain the integrity of our financial markets through continued supervisory vigilance. However, we will also constantly review and update rules and regulations, to sustain a conducive environment for our financial sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Privatisation Programme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>8. The successful flotation of Singapore Telecom has created a large new class of citizen shareholders. The Government will privatise other suitable statutory boards and list them on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Singaporeans will be given opportunities to own shares and take a stake in Singapore's success. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Civil Service</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>9. Civil Service salaries have been revised to keep pace with the private sector. At the same time, a new medical benefits scheme, built upon Medisave and Medishield, was introduced. The Government will continue to maintain its remuneration at levels that will attract and retain the quality of personnel needed to administer the public sector efficiently. \n  <br>\n  <br>10. We will review the present civil service arrangements for recruiting, promoting and managing personnel, centred on the Public Service Commission and the Public Service Division, which were inherited from the colonial government. Where necessary, we will make fundamental changes to the management of the Civil Service, and free its personnel administration, in order to make the public sector a more responsive and competitive employer without compromising the integrity and impartiality of the Civil Service and the statutory boards. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. We will give departments with self-contained, coherent functions more operating autonomy to carry out their missions, for example by converting them into statutory boards. We will delegate more personnel management authority to Ministries. This will give line managers greater flexibility, responsibility and accountability in managing human resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. The pilot Workplace Healthy Lifestyle Programme launched in September 1992 to promote health and fitness in the public service received encouraging response. It will eventually be extended to the entire public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>13. The Civil Service College offered its first programme in April 1993. Its mission is to engage senior Civil Service officers in a continuous process of improvement, to keep the Service efficient, effective and cohesive. The College will acquire its own premises in a few years' time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Social Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>14. The United Nations has designated 1994 as the International Year of the Family. We will use this opportunity to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> make single Singaporeans aware of the importance of family life. The Social Development Unit will be introducing TelePal, an electronic communications system via Teleview, in June 1994. More marriage preparation courses will also be conducted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr YEO CHEOW TONG\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Trade and Industry\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Economic Growth</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy grew strongly by 9.8% in 1993. The economic boom in Asia has cushioned us against the weak economic performance of the developed countries, our traditional export markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>2. We must participate fully in the business opportunities in the region. Our competitive advantage remains unchanged: a competent and hardworking quality workforce and excellent infrastructure. We will focus on developing human resources so as to raise productivity and the quality of goods and services produced. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. We will expand economic cooperation with countries in the region. Becoming an international business hub with first class services in finance, commerce and communications will help. We will closely support the efforts of the business community to build linkages and participate in key markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Domestic Economy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. We will be pro-active in our industrial development to counter the increased competition for manufacturing investments. Other developing countries offer vast resources at low rates. They are also catching up on infrastructural development. We must compete on the basis of capabilities. We will develop specific industry clusters to improve our competitiveness. We will invest selectively in strategic industrial projects with private sector partners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. In industrial promotion, we will shift from offering ourselves as an attractive offshore production and services centre to making Singapore a regional home base for MNCs and local companies. We will make Singapore a place for high-value added manufacturing activities and related services such as design, R&amp;D and marketing. We will maintain our industrial base and maintain the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP at around 25%. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. We will continue to emphasize education and training. A skilled workforce can adapt better to the demands of new economic activities. More places in the universities, polytechnics and technical institutes will be created. Presently 16% of each cohort enters university. 7% of the workforce are graduates. By 2000, 12% of the workforce will be graduates. \n  <br>\n  <br>7. We will continue to upgrade those who are already working. The National Productivity Board (NPB) will train 100,000 workers through structured on-the-job training by the year 2000. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. With an aging population, increasing longevity and a higher retirement age of 60 years, we have to continually retrain our workers to meet the changing demands for new skills. NPB will continue to target specific skills enhancement programmes like the Training Leave Scheme, the Fast Forward Scheme and the Training Initiative for Mature Employees (TIME) at older workers to help them stay productive. We will continue to seek new ways to help workers participate in training programmes, and to encourage them to continually upgrade themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. We must produce high quality products and services. The National Productivity and Quality Council will spearhead a National Quality Strategy to inculcate a sense of quality consciousness in our people and implement initiatives to promote quality systems. The Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR), our national standards and certification body, will actively promote the SISIR ISO 9000 certification scheme for quality management systems. NPB will also help small retailers to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> upgrade their productivity and management systems, including forming of franchises. \n  <br>\n  <br>10. The National Science and Technology Board will promote research and development in key technologies that are economically relevant. This will deepen our knowledge-intensive activities and attract more companies to do R&amp;D in Singapore. We target R&amp;D spending to reach 2% of GDP in the next few years, with a larger share coming from the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. We will continue to upgrade our infrastructure to meet the needs of industries. The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) has begun amalgamating the group of seven islands off Jurong for industrial use. The project will add 1,800 ha of industrial land to our stock and provide us enough industrial land for the long-term. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) will spend $8.4 billion over the next 5 years to expand its generation, production, transmission and distribution capacities for electricity, water and piped gas. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. STPB will improve the tourism product in Singapore and market it overseas. As many tourism \"hardware\" projects including large scale conservation of historical areas have been completed in recent years, STPB will now focus on the \"software\" aspects to add charm and enjoyment to the total tourism experience. We will improve the quality of our retail sale services as shopping is an important tourist attraction. Creative lighting of Singapore River bridges and the Empress Place, Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall will create a dramatic backdrop to riverside activities. Sentosa Development Corporation will develop a leisure and tourist resort with tourist attractions and residential properties at Buran Darat on Sentosa. We will develop the Southern Islands as a resort with water-based recreational facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Regionalisation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>13. Singapore will step up its regionalisation thrust. Local companies have developed the organizational, technical and marketing skills to venture overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> They are poised to participate in the opportunities of the fast growing regional economies. \n  <br>\n  <br>14. We will encourage local companies expanding overseas to team up with MNCs to pool resources and tap complementary strengths. We will draw on the expertise and track record of government agencies in infrastructure projects to help companies. A Regional Business Forum will be established for exchanging dialogue with the private sector. We will streamline government regulations and financial assistance to facilitate overseas business operations. TDB will help companies expand their overseas network through franchising and licensing. \n  <br>\n  <br>15. We will continue to expand economic cooperation activities with other countries. We will participate fully in the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) Scheme to establish the ASEAN Free Trade Area. In the Growth Triangle, more than 150 local and multinational companies in Singapore have set up manufacturing operations in the Riau Province and Johor. In China, a consortium of Singapore companies will develop a 70 sq km industrial township in Suzhou city. We will support this effort by working with the PRC government on transfer of public administration and urban management capability to manage the township well. A Singapore-Shandong Business Council has been established to facilitate trade and investment between Singapore and the Province of Shandong. A Vietnam-Singapore Commission for Cooperation and an Indian Business Interaction Group have also been set up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR LEE YOCK SUAN\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Education\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next four years, the Ministry of Education will phase in improvements to the system for primary and secondary education as well as employment-related education and training. Our pupils will be provided with at least 10 years of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> schooling before they proceed to further education and training. At the tertiary level, the universities will focus on better teaching and step up research and development activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Provision of 10 years of Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. Starting from Secondary 1 in January 1994, the Ministry will implement a new Normal (Technical) course to complement the existing Special, Express and Normal (Academic) courses in secondary schools. The new course will provide a technical-oriented curriculum for less academically inclined pupils and prepare them for training at the institutes of technical education and for employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. Since the 1980s, streaming in schools has enabled pupils to learn at their own pace. Recent modifications to the streaming system will enable more pupils to reach higher levels of attainment in education and vocational training. The Ministry will closely monitor the implementation of these modifications and if necessary make further adjustments to iron out problems which emerge. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Premature School Leavers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. Since the 1980s, pupil attrition and educational wastage have been significantly reduced. The Ministry will work with the community self-help groups and with parents to reduce further the number of premature school leavers. The Pastoral Care Programme will be introduced in more schools with the objective of identifying and supporting pupils who may otherwise drop out of school. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Autonomous Schools</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. To provide quality education at affordable costs, the Ministry has introduced autonomous schools. Six schools will become autonomous in January 1994 to complement the existing 8 independent schools. The autonomous schools will have more autonomy and resources to improve their educational programmes. The Ministry plans to have 10 to 15 autonomous schools spread throughout Singapore over the next few years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Edusave Scheme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6. Edusave was launched in 1993 with a total capital contribution of $2 billion from the Government. In 1993, each eligible pupil received $50 in his or her Edusave account. This annual contribution will be increased to $100 in January 1994, and should reach about $400 when the Edusave Endowment Fund builds up to the targeted sum of $5 billion. Edusave will also continue to fund scholarships to independent and other secondary schools and provide annual grants, averaging $100,000 per secondary school, to improve their quality of teaching and learning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Professional Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. The education system depends on good and dedicated teachers who touch the hearts and minds of our children, and capable school leaders who set the tone and direction of the schools. The Education Service must continue to attract good people. The Ministry will further improve the system of rewarding good officers, and grooming capable officers for leadership positions in the Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>School Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>8. The Ministry will build 8 new primary schools by 1994 to cater for a larger primary school population. At the secondary level, 11 new schools will be built and 29 existing schools upgraded by 1997 to enable more secondary schools to function as single-session schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Post-Secondary Education and Training</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>9. The building of the 2 new polytechnics will provide more education and training opportunities for secondary school leavers. The polytechnics cater for 40% of the age cohort. They will continue to maintain close links with industry to provide practice-oriented education. \n  <br>\n  <br>10. The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) plans to enrol 10,000 secondary school leavers annually, about 25% of an age cohort. Besides full-time courses, the ITE will provide apprenticeship training and strengthen its Continuing Education and Training programmes for adult workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>University Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>11. The National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will introduce more flexible systems of university courses. At NUS the modular system, first introduced in 1993, will be extended to other courses. NTU will adopt the academic unit system. Both approaches combine the rigour and depth of the British system with the flexibility and breadth of the American credit system. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. The primary task of the universities is to produce high-level manpower. NUS and NTU will improve on their teaching programmes and step up research and development activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>13. The Government continues to support the Singapore Institute of Management to implement the Open University Degree Programme in collaboration with the Open University of the UK. The first intake of about 1000 mature students has been admitted in January 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR MAH BOW TAN\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Communications\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Air Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to maintain Changi Airport's reputation as the best airport in the world. The $200 million refurbishment programme for Terminal 1 will be completed by the later half of 1994. We are also adding two new piers to Terminal 2 at a cost of $350 million. One will be ready by end 1995 and the other by end 1996. These improvements will increase the capacity of Terminals 1 and 2 together to 35 million passengers, from the original designed capacity of 24 million. Concept design has also started for Terminal 3 which is expected to be needed by early next century. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Sea Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. We will continue to develop Singapore port. By raising productivity and offering \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the best value-for-money services, we can stay the world's busiest port and one of the top container ports. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. PSA plans to invest $4.3 billion in new facilities from now to 1998. It is developing a mega-port in Pasir Panjang to serve our needs into the 21st century. Reclamation for Phase I began in August 1993, and will be completed in 2000. This phase will involve the development of eight berths, costing $2 billion. The first five berths will be operational in 1998. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. Brani Terminal is currently being expanded from the present six berths to nine berths. When this is completed in 1994, the terminal will be able to handle 4.8 million TEUs a year. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. The container freight station at Nelson Road, Keppel Distripark, commenced operations in October 1993. It will boost Singapore's position as a regional cargo distribution centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Telecommunications</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Maintaining Service Standards</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6. As the regulatory authority, the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) has established mandatory service standards and performance indicators to ensure that Singapore Telecom and Singapore Post continue to provide quality telecommunications and postal services at fair prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Developing the Telecommunications Industry</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. TAS will promote the development of a Telecommunications Technology Park in Singapore to provide a customised R&amp;D test bed for telecommunications companies. The $65 million project is expected to be completed at the end of 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Progressive Liberalisation Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>8. TAS is progressively liberalising and deregulating the telecommunication and postal industries to promote greater competition and encourage new service providers to enter the industry, in order to lower prices and offer a wider range of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> products and services to consumers. It has removed the volume sensitive tariff on value-added network operators, and freed up the market for customer premises equipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. TAS will introduce competition in cellular mobile telephone and radio paging services when Singapore Telecom_s (ST) exclusive rights in these areas expire on 31st March 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Land Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>10. We will keep our roads free-flowing so that people and goods can move about efficiently and smoothly. The implementation of Whole-Day Area Licensing Scheme from January 1994 will even out traffic flows into the Central Business District, and give all road users a smoother and easier ride throughout the day. We will introduce more usage control measures to limit traffic congestion, and thus enable more people to own cars. In the longer term, the Electronic Road Pricing System, to be implemented from 1997, will be a more responsive and effective way to control traffic flows. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. We will continue to make commuter facilities and the public transport system more convenient, accessible and affordable to commuters. The $1.3 billion Woodlands MRT extension will be operational in early 1996. We will encourage bus operators to upgrade their buses and streamline their routes, to provide a comprehensive integrated network of public transport service together with the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR WONG KAN SENG\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Home Affairs\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the maintenance of law, order and security, the Ministry of Home Affairs will implement new initiatives to combat crime and drug abuse, and to raise civil defence preparedness. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Law and Order</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. The Police Force will: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Intensify its community-policing efforts by training officers to solve problems at the neighbourhood level. They will work more closely with community leaders to achieve this; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b Develop a Command, Control and Communication (C3) System over the next three years. This computerised system will monitor incidents and aid decision-making. Amongst others, Police cars will be equipped with data terminals; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Upgrade the Intelligence Division (ID) to keep ahead of new trends in increasingly complex cross-border crimes. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. The Traffic Police will: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Review and tighten the testing and licensing of motorcyclists in view of their high fatality rate in accidents; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Require Probationary Class 2B and Class 3 driving licence holders to display special `P' plates to encourage them to drive more carefully; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Make more use of technology to monitor traffic to deal with accidents and traffic jams. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Anti-Drug Measures</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. The Central Narcotics Bureau will: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Intensify action against Singapore-based syndicates involved in international drug trafficking since an increasing number of Singaporeans have been arrested overseas for drug trafficking; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Enforce the recently enacted Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act against drug traffickers; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Emphasize preventive drug education and work closely with non-government organisations to tackle the problem of relapses among addicts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rehabilitation of Offenders</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. We will open the new Tanah Merah Prison and Changi Women's Prison in early 1994. These prisons will relieve acute overcrowding and offer better rehabilitation facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. The new Tampines Drug Rehabilitation Complex will be ready by 1999. This will be the first facility designed specially for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. The Complex will eventually replace most of the existing drug rehabilitation centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Civil Defence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Build up a pool of paramedical personnel for its emergency ambulance service by 1996. This will relieve the shortage of ambulance nurses without compromising quality; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Equip ambulances with defibrillators by February 1994 to improve pre-hospital emergency cardiac care to heart attack victims; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Strengthen its ability to handle incidents involving hazardous materials, such as spillage and accidental release of dangerous chemicals and gases. Special units known as HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) teams will be ready by 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Immigration and National Registration</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>8. The Immigration Department will work with economic agencies to attract foreign talent and skills to Singapore and grant Employment Passes and Permanent Residence to those who can be an asset to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. The Immigration Department will upgrade its operational systems and improve its work procedures to serve the public better. It will further shorten the time for processing applications for permits and passes, despite their growing volume. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>10. The National Registration Department will complete the Identity Card Re-registration Exercise by end 1994.

Where appropriate, we will adopt international conventions and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international trade and dispute settlements. \n  <br>\n  <br>2. To create a more predictable legal environment for business operations, we will review and, where necessary, modify our commercial laws. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. Following the enactment of the Application of English Law Act 1993, we will review other Acts of Parliament which rely on English law. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. We will introduce legislation to abolish all appeals to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. In law reform, our two priority areas will be new legislation on patents and bankruptcy: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. \n  <i>Patents</i>: We will introduce new laws to upgrade the existing patent system and make it more convenient for Singaporeans to obtain patent protection for their inventions. We propose to change the current requirement that Singaporeans must first obtain patent protection in the United Kingdom before their inventions can be protected in Singapore, and instead allow Singaporeans to file patent applications locally. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. \n  <i>Bankruptcy</i>: We will introduce legislation to improve administration of the affairs of bankrupts, and protect creditors' interests without stifling entrepreneurship. We will strike a fair balance between the interests of the debtor, the creditor and society. There will be greater accountability of bankrupts in the administration of their estates on the one hand, and speedier discharges of bankrupts on the other. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. The Registry of Land Titles will be converting all lands from the common law to the land titles registration system. It will computerise the Land Titles Register to handle more land transactions and public searches. \n  <br>\n  <br>7. The Attorney-General's Chambers will improve its function of giving legal advice to Ministries and Departments by centralising legal services in its Civil Division. It will assign teams of legal officers dedicated to different Ministries and Departments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   PROF S JAYAKUMAR\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Foreign Affairs\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy interests are broadening. Relations with our ASEAN neighbours remain central. At the same time, we are deepening and expanding links, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. Our excellent relations with countries like India, China and Vietnam help us build an external wing to the Singapore economy. Projects are underway in India and China. These complement our established collaboration with our neighbours through the Growth Triangle. \n  <br>\n  <br>2. Singapore will continue to work with ASEAN and other Asia-Pacific countries to preserve optimal conditions for growth. Asia-Pacific countries share a common interest in managing the post Cold War changes, keeping themselves competitive and upholding an open international \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trading system. Singapore strongly supports APEC as a vehicle for engaging major Asia-Pacific countries in a constructive framework that promotes stability, growth and free trade. The ASEAN Free Trade Area and the East Asia Economic Caucus complement APEC. The ASEAN Regional Forum adds substance to security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. It brings together all the major actors in a single forum, and will help them to build confidence and evolve a predictable pattern of relationships. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. We will fulfil our obligations as a responsible member of the international community. The United Nations plays a key role in maintaining a stable post Cold War global environment. Singapore has participated in the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia and several other UN peacekeeping operations. We also contribute actively to the ongoing debate on how to reform the UN system to make it more effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, we are sharing our development experiences with many developing countries. Our Indochina Assistance Fund helps to promote economic development and reintegrate those countries into the regional community. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   BG (NS) GEORGE YONG-BOON YEO\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Health\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health aims to nurture a healthy nation by promoting good health. It will also ensure that Singaporeans continue to have access to good and affordable basic medical services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Nurturing A Healthy Nation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. The Ministry will continue to educate the public to lead healthy lifestyles to reduce the incidence of heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. We will conduct annual nation-wide campaigns to encourage Singaporeans to keep fit and to make healthy lifestyle a way of life. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will continue to discourage smoking vigorously, particularly among the youths. We will also promote good mental health so that Singaporeans will have sound minds and healthy bodies. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. The Ministry will continue its comprehensive disease prevention programme. It will maintain a high immunisation rate against the common childhood diseases and upgrade the health surveillance programme for early detection of physical and developmental abnormalties in children. We will expand health screening to detect and treat diseases early in specific risk groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Ensuring Good And Affordable Basic Medical Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. We will implement the proposals in the White Paper on Affordable Health Care to contain health care costs and maintain high standards of basic health care. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Extending The Scope Of Medishield</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. We are reviewing Medishield to enlarge its scope and the extent of coverage. We will also allow competing providers to provide more flexibility, higher service standards and greater consumer choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Upgrading Hospitals And Primary Health Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6. Alexandra Hospital will be upgraded by the end of 1994. National University Hospital will expand and introduce Class C beds. The redevelopment of Tan Tock Seng and Kandang Kerbau Hospitals is underway. A new general hospital will be built in the eastern part of Singapore. All hospitals will have at least 65% of Class B2 and C beds. \n  <br>\n  <br>7. The new Woodbridge Hospital, opened last year, provides better facilities and services to mental patients. We will restructure Woodbridge Hospital to give it more autonomy to improve its services. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. We will develop specialist medical centres for Cancer and Heart to provide specialised care and improve treatment of patients with cancer and heart diseases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 9. A new polyclinic at Bukit Batok will be ready in 1994. Two new polyclinics will be built at Geylang and Chua Chu Kang. The new Institute of Health and National Dental Centre are under construction and will be completed in 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>10. We will continue to expand the Home Nursing Service to meet the needs of the elderly. The Ang Mo Kio Senior Citizens_ Health Care Centre opened last year to provide day care and rehabilitation services for the elderly sick. Other centres will be opened in Woodlands and Geylang within the next two years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Maintaining High Professional Standards</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>11. The Ministry will continue to ensure high professional standards in private hospitals and medical clinics through licensing, regulating and auditing of health care establishments. We will set up a Register of specialists under the Medical Registration Act so that specialists are properly accredited. We will introduce legislation to regulate contact lens practitioners to ensure a high standard of contact lens practice in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. We will upgrade the Pharmaceutical Services, Blood Transfusion Services and Forensic Science Services by improving their management systems and by using information technology, so that they can better support hospitals and other institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Achieving Replacement Fertility</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>13. We will continue to encourage Singaporeans to have three children or more if they can afford it, in order to achieve replacement fertility level. We will monitor the population trends and adjust population policies to meet the manpower needs of the country. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Preparing For The Future</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>14. The Ministry will study the legislation of countries with living wills to examine how best to introduce similar legislation here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND THE ARTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   BG (NS) GEORGE YONG-BOON YEO\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Information and the Arts\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will press on with our efforts to make Singapore an international hub for media and culture. We have made some progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Library 2000</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. The National Library will be restructured as a statutory board this year to implement the recommendations of the Library 2000 Review Committee. We will develop our libraries into convenient centres for enjoying books, pursuing knowledge and acquiring skills. More children's libraries will be set up. We will also cater to the particular information needs of the business and arts communities. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. The Tampines Regional Library will be opened this year as a test bed for new ideas. We will involve the local community in running it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Broadcasting</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>4. Exciting changes are taking place in the broadcasting industry. We cannot escape the effects of satellite broadcasting, channel proliferation and global competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. To make SBC more competitive, we will corporatise it at the end of 1994 into several separate companies. These companies will be gradually privatised over a period of time. A statutory board, the Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) will be set up to license and regulate broadcasters. SBA will help finance public service broadcasts and local production with funds from licence fees, franchise fees and the government. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. The Singapore International Foundation launched the Singapore International Television (SITV) service on 1st January 1994. It is carried on Indonesia's Palapa Satellite, and broadcasts SBC_s English news live to Singaporeans and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> friends of Singapore living in the region. This is our first foray into satellite broadcasting. \n  <br>\n  <br>7. An external radio service will be launched on 1st February 1994, broadcasting on shortwave. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. We have started to wire up the whole of Singapore for cable TV and other multi-media services. This is part of our national plan to make Singapore an _intelligent island_. The cable network will give us a headstart over other cities in terms of information technology infrastructure. Within a decade, with data compression techniques, cable TV may provide Singapore households with up to 100 channels. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. Where necessary, we will relax our rules to make it easier for international media organisations to base their regional operations in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Arts</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>10. The masterplan and schematic design of the Singapore Arts Centre will be completed in the first quarter of 1994. Construction will begin in mid-1995. When completed by the year 2000, the Singapore Arts Centre will have auditoriums for a wide range of performing arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. We will continue to encourage the staging of world-class productions in Singapore which attract local and regional audiences. We can make Singapore a major centre for cultural performances and other art events in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. The National Arts Council (NAC) will help art schools like NAFA and LaSalle to achieve higher standards and become affiliated to good tertiary institutions at home and abroad. Our universities and polytechnics have increased their range of arts courses. NAC will extend its Arts Education Programme to more schools in 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>13. While we continue to nurture Singaporean artists and art groups, our indigenous talent pool will never be enough. We also encourage foreign artistic talent to live, work and settle here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Heritage</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>14. The Singapore Art Museum at the old St Joseph_s Institution will be ready in 1995. It will display works by local and foreign artists. The old Tao Nan School will be renovated by 1995, and will form part of the Asian Civilisations Museum. Work to refurbish the Empress Place Museum and provide it with international museum facilities will begin in early 1995. The National Museum will continue to bring in exhibitions from all over the world, including a major exhibition on the civilization of India in May this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>15. The National Museum has attracted several valuable donations of art, most recently a collection of Chinese paintings from the Venerable Song Nian. We hope this will become a tradition among collectors in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>16. The Chinese community and the National Heritage Board will help to establish a Chinese Heritage Museum at the Administration Building of the former Nanyang University, and the Malay community a Malay Heritage Centre at the old Kampong Glam Istana. \n  <br>\n  <br>17. The recent international art and antique fair, Tresors '93, was successful beyond expectation. We are becoming an international centre for the art and antique trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   DR YEO NING HONG\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Defence\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Singapore enjoys peace, prosperity and good relations with our neighbours. But events in the last few years have dramatically brought home the importance of preparing for the untoward and unexpected. The post-Cold War world is not necessarily a safer place for us. The geopolitical balance is still in a state of flux. Regional conflicts continue everywhere. Singapore is a small country in an era of big powers. We must maintain vigilance in defence through a strong and operationally ready SAF to preserve our security in this world order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Total Defence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. Total Defence is Singapore's strategy for security. With Total Defence, our people will be vigilant and prepared in facing the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. Psychological Defence strengthens our commitment to our country and confidence in our future. It is about Singaporeans' collective will to stand up for our rights, to protect what is ours, to live in peace, and to prosper in our own way as a nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. The SAF is the military arm of Total Defence. It protects the interests, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Republic from external threats. It maintains an operational readiness and a military capability that can act decisively should deterrence fail. But the responsibility of safeguarding our country is not the SAF's alone. It is a collective responsibility involving every Singaporean. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. Total Defence was launched nearly a decade ago. In 1994, MINDEF aims to create awareness of the collective responsibility for Total Defence among the new generation, and show them their part to play. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>National Servicemen</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6. National service began in 1967. Since then almost half a million men have trained as soldiers through full-time national service to become \"operationally ready national servicemen\". This is a more appropriate term than \"reservists\" to describe our citizen soldiers who have completed their full-time training, and are ready at short notice to assume their front-line battle positions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Training</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. MINDEF will continue to recruit its share of able Singaporeans at every level in every cohort, to train them and motivate them to give of their best in the defence of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. People constitute our most precious resource. Over the past two years, we have improved the management of Basic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Military Training for national servicemen, and reduced medical attrition and training injuries by 70%. We will continue to streamline training wherever possible. As the educational level of the population rises, we will make more use of sophisticated training means such as computer-aided instruction and simulators. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. Morale and motivation of soldiers are critical. MINDEF will continue to ensure that our soldiers are fit and operationally ready, equipped with the latest technology, and provided with good logistical support. \n  <br>\n  <br>10. We also need strong and capable officers who can lead and motivate their men in battle. The new SAFTI Military Institute to be set up in 1994 will improve the training of our officer cadre. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Technology</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>11. The SAF relies heavily on technology as the force multiplier to overcome its limited manpower base. MINDEF will introduce additional advanced fighters, maritime patrol aircraft, mine countermeasure vessels and other high technology weapon systems to protect our territory and vital sea lines of communications. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. We need a self-reliant capability in defence technology. Research and development must be complemented by a strong defence industry able to translate operational requirements and advanced technology into fighting systems. We have built up important indigenous industrial capabilities, and integrated advanced systems into small fighting platforms, as demonstrated by the FH88 howitzer, missile corvettes and A4-SU Super Skyhawks. This has reduced the SAF_s manpower requirements, and increased its fire power and manoeuverability. MINDEF will further enhance its strategic technological and industrial capabilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Defence Relations</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>13. MINDEF will continue to promote good defence ties with other armed forces. These help to develop mutual \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> confidence and understanding, and contribute to regional peace and security. We hold regular bilateral and multilateral exercises with friendly countries in the region and beyond. \n  <br>\n  <br>14. New overseas training opportunities have also been made available to the SAF. These include test-firing of artillery weapons at ranges in India, the Air Combat Manoeuvring Range (ACMR) in Sumatra to be inaugurated in 1994, the transfer of the Flying Training School (FTS) to Australia, and the current training of our pilots on F-16 fighters in the United States. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>International Responsibilities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>15. Singapore is a responsible member of the international community. MINDEF will continue to support international peacekeeping under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). MINDEF currently supports the UN mission at the Iraq-Kuwait border (UNIKOM) with an observer team. In recognition of SAF's capability and commitment, a senior SAF officer has been appointed as UNIKOM's Chief of Staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR MAH BOW TAN\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for the Environment\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment will implement the Green Plan to develop Singapore into a model green city. We will step up public education to make Singaporeans more environmentally aware and responsible. Singaporeans can then enjoy a cleaner environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>2. We will begin selling hawker stalls to incumbent stallholders this year. This is part of the overall plan to help Singaporeans to own assets and take a stake in the country. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. We will continue to improve our infrastructure and services:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. An offshore sanitary landfill will be constructed to replace the rapidly diminishing site at Lorong Halus. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. The open treatment tanks at the Kranji Sewage Treatment Works will be covered up by next year. Other treatment works will be similarly upgraded to reduce the odour nuisance and to free land around the works for higher value developments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. The walls of the Singapore River will be rebuilt. This will make the river more attractive and allow for more recreational uses. The river will also be deepened to increase its drainage capacity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. We will mechanise street cleansing further, and explore less labour intensive ways to collect refuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. We will continue stringent enforcement against mosquito breeding and educate the public on measures to curb the incidence of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. \n  <br>\n  <br>5. We will implement control measures to keep noise at acceptable levels through proper land use, technological, engineering and other practicable means. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. We will strengthen co-operation with our neighbours in environmental protection and management. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   MR ABDULLAH TARMUGI\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Acting Minister for Community Development\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD will foster, with maximum community participation, a cohesive, compassionate and robust society. It will support and work closely with civic, community and voluntary welfare organizations to raise the level and variety of community support services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhancing Racial Harmony and Social Cohesion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2. The Peoples' Association (PA) will work with civic, voluntary and community organizations to strengthen community \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cohesion and national unity. It will strengthen the grassroots movement_s role as a channel of communication between the people and Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>3. PA will hold the first Triennial Grassroots Conference in early 1994. The Conference will discuss ideas for improving the effectiveness and outreach of grassroots organizations. \n  <br>\n  <br>4. Feedback Unit will reach out to more segments of the population. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>A More Compassionate Society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>5. In partnership with the many helping hands of civic, community, self-help and voluntary welfare organizations, we will continue to provide social services for the needy and the disadvantaged. We will help the voluntary welfare sector improve social services for the aged, the disabled, children in need and low-income families. \n  <br>\n  <br>6. The Ministry will work together with the National Council of Social Service and voluntary welfare organizations to strengthen and improve the network of community social services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Strengthening the Family</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>7. To coincide with the International Year of the Family in 1994, MCD will hold a year-long series of family-oriented activities. These activities will emphasize the importance of strong family relationships. The Committee on the Family under the Advisory Council on the Family and the Aged will, with public inputs, produce a concise document on Singapore's values and beliefs on the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>8. The Small Families Improvement Scheme starts in January 1994. It will provide housing and education subsidies to intact low income families who want to help themselves by keeping their families small. \n  <br>\n  <br>9. We will continue to set up child care centres, in line with market demand. We will provide more opportunities for training of child care personnel to support child care centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Senior Citizens</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>10. Senior citizens should continue to play active and valued roles in the community. The proportion of elderly persons (aged 60 years and above) will increase from the present 10% of the population to 26% in 2030. We will encourage setting up more Mutual Help Groups, Senior Citizens' Clubs and other family-oriented programmes and activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>11. PA will help to set up more RC-based Mutual Help Groups (MHGs). There will be 50 MHGs by 1995, compared to 11 now. By 2000, all RC-based Senior Citizens Clubs will have Mutual Help Groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>12. The Ministry will encourage the elderly to live with their families. For the minority living alone, MCD and HDB have jointly started a pilot project to upgrade their living environment on a block basis. Voluntary welfare organizations will help organize social and recreational programmes for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>13. Sheltered housing allows the elderly destitute to live independently and yet maintain their links with the community. We will encourage existing community homes for the aged to upgrade to sheltered housing, and where necessary help voluntary groups to build new sheltered housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>A Fit and Robust Society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>14. The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) will step up promotion of Sports for All, in conjunction with the National Healthy Lifestyle campaign. It will emphasize family sports, to promote both fitness and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> family togetherness. SSC will improve fitness instruction through better training for fitness instructors. \n  <br>\n  <br>15. SSC will work together with the National Sports Associations, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Defence, Singapore National Olympic Council and other relevant bodies to implement the Sports Excellence Plan, and raise the standard of competitive sports in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhancing Youth Participation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>16. The National Youth Council (NYC) will extend and enhance its range of programmes and activities. It will foster greater youth participation in these programmes and serve as an important channel for youths to express their views and contribute to the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>17. PA will complete redevelopment of the Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) by 1995. The new facilities include multi-dimensional rock-climbing walls, training pools, rope challenge courses and seacraft. These new facilities will enable more youths to develop their sense of adventure and mental and physical ruggedness. PA will also enhance the Overseas Youth Programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MUIS</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>18. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will work closely with the community and other Malay/Muslim organisations to strengthen the religious values of Muslims in Singapore. The Government will, together with Yayasan Mendaki and other interested groups, work to improve the educational, economic and socio-cultural status of the Malay/Muslim community.   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
