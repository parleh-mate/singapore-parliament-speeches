For\r\n\r\nexample, a footnote appearing in page 153 states:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(v) In certain cases, holders of these posts\r\n\r\ndraw  in  addition  pensionable allowances  of $120,\r\n\r\n$180, $240, or $300 p.m.'.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I have been trying to find out whether other\r\n\r\nMinistries   have   payments  of  these   so-called\r\n\r\npensionable  allowances. In fact, I believe  I  can\r\n\r\nsee  none.  I  suppose these so-called  pensionable\r\n\r\nallowances are given to certain officers  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  promoted, say, from the post  of  teacher  to\r\n\r\nprincipal,  or  lecturer, or school  inspector,  or\r\n\r\nspecialist teacher. If my supposition is correct, I\r\n\r\nam  inclined  to believe that the payment  of  such\r\n\r\nkind  of  allowances  is far from  satisfactory.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to know whose brainchild it was to grant\r\n\r\nsuch  pensionable allowances, and how much  it  has\r\n\r\ncost us each year when this system was instituted.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, is the Minister for Education aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  other Ministries have no such system  of\r\n\r\npensionable allowances? To me, Sir, it would appear\r\n\r\nthat  any officer in the Ministry of Education  who\r\n\r\nhas been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromoted, be it to principal, inspector of  school,\r\n\r\nspecialist  teacher, inspector, or lecturer,  would\r\n\r\nautomatically  enjoy  such benefit  in  pensionable\r\n\r\nallowances. However, I must stress that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nagainst  these civil servants obtaining any  higher\r\n\r\npay  if  they  so  deserve as  a  result  of  being\r\n\r\npromoted. Therefore, I would like to propose to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education that this kind of payment be\r\n\r\nscrapped and in its place a proper salary structure\r\n\r\nbe  instituted so as to give not only uniformity in\r\n\r\nthe  salary  structure  but also  opportunities  to\r\n\r\naspirants  to  reach  the  very  top  rung  of  the\r\n\r\neducation ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I agree with what the Member has said\r\n\r\non  the  amendment.  Not very  long  ago  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Education  proposed   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  (Amendment) Bill, I  pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nthere was a loophole in it, namely, that there  was\r\n\r\nonly  provision  for  a Vice-Chancellor  without  a\r\n\r\nChancellor,  although the Chairman of the  Council,\r\n\r\nas  stated  by the Minister, was in name compatible\r\n\r\nwith that of Chancellor. But actually the nature of\r\n\r\nthe  duties  of  the  Chairman  of  the  University\r\n\r\nCouncil  was not suitable to make him a  Chancellor\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang University, because the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nCouncil shall be elected by the Council from  among\r\n\r\nits  members  while  a Chancellor  is  usually  not\r\n\r\nappointed  by election. The Minister did  not  take\r\n\r\nproper  steps  to amend the law but allowed  it  to\r\n\r\nremain  as  it  was.  Through his  toleration,  the\r\n\r\ndesignations of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and  the\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor have been officially  announced  to\r\n\r\nbe   the  \"Vice-Chancellor\"  and  the  \"Chancellor\"\r\n\r\nrespectively  in  the text of Chinese  translation.\r\n\r\nThese   difficulties  arise   when   there   is   a\r\n\r\ntranslation from English to Chinese and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There  are  more  than  3,000  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  graduates,  some  of  whom  have   gone\r\n\r\nabroad,  some  are already working,  and  some  are\r\n\r\nserving   society.  Many  Nanyang  graduates   have\r\n\r\nachieved distinction in higher institutions abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are also many eminent and successful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNanyang  graduates  serving in  various  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and commercial and industrial  circles\r\n\r\nin every walk of life and their achievements can be\r\n\r\nseen by all to be quite meritorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government is giving equal treatment\r\n\r\nto Nanyang graduates, when these graduates apply to\r\n\r\njoin Government service, the Government seems to be\r\n\r\nhesitating   about  the  recognition   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity degrees. The Government does not seem to\r\n\r\nhave taken any decision on this matter, although in\r\n\r\nthe past I have already said that this question  is\r\n\r\nvery pressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only hear the sound of Government promise\r\n\r\nwithout  its  being actually put into practice.  If\r\n\r\nthis  problem is not solved, it will embarrass many\r\n\r\nof  our Nanyang graduates who go abroad for further\r\n\r\nstudies.   The   reason  is   that   many   foreign\r\n\r\nuniversities  have  recognised  Nanyang   graduates\r\n\r\nbecause  they have achieved good academic  results.\r\n\r\nYet   our  own  country  is  not  giving  them  any\r\n\r\nrecognition.

The system  of  post\r\n\r\nallowances  in  the  Education  service  was  first\r\n\r\nintroduced   in  October  1953  with  retrospective\r\n\r\neffect to 1st January, 1950. It formed part of  the\r\n\r\noverall salary revision which was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproved   after  negotiations  between  the   then\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the trade union then  representing\r\n\r\nthe  teaching profession. The new salary scales and\r\n\r\nthe post allowances were written into the Education\r\n\r\nservice  scheme  forming part  of  the  Scheme  for\r\n\r\nHigher   Services,   1953.   In   the   course   of\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  the Graduate Teachers'  Association,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  since gone out of existence,  played  a\r\n\r\nprominent  part. Under the scheme, post  allowances\r\n\r\nranging from $120 to $360 per month are attached to\r\n\r\ncertain  posts  such as lecturers in the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining   College,  Inspectors  of   Schools   and\r\n\r\nprincipals of primary and secondary schools.  These\r\n\r\nallowances become pensionable emoluments as soon as\r\n\r\nthe   officers  concerned  are  emplaced   on   the\r\n\r\npensionable  establishment.  In  other  words,  for\r\n\r\npensionable   officers  these  allowances   attract\r\n\r\nvariable allowance in the same way as basic  salary\r\n\r\nand   are  taken  into  account  for  purposes   of\r\n\r\ncomputing pension and gratuity. This system of post\r\n\r\nallowances,  I agree, has led to many anomalies  in\r\n\r\nthe  service, chief among them being the fact  that\r\n\r\nprincipals of secondary schools draw a higher  rate\r\n\r\nof   allowance  than  Inspectors  of  Schools  when\r\n\r\nlogically it should be the other way round. Because\r\n\r\nof  different rates of allowances being attached to\r\n\r\ndifferent   posts  of  more  or   less   the   same\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  it  is not  possible  to  transfer\r\n\r\nofficers    of   comparable   qualifications    and\r\n\r\nexperience from one post to another in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the service and of the officers themselves.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  agree with the Member for Punggol  that\r\n\r\nthe  system of post allowances should be  abolished\r\n\r\nin  favour of different salary scales for different\r\n\r\ngrades   of  officers  with  a  variety  of   Posts\r\n\r\nrequiring  the  same qualifications and  experience\r\n\r\nwithin  each grade. My Ministry has, in fact,  made\r\n\r\nrepresentations   along   these   lines   to    the\r\n\r\nappropriate  quarters  and  the  outcome  is  being\r\n\r\nawaited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the Chinese translation of  the  terms\r\n\r\n\"Vice-Chancellor\" and \"Deputy Vice-Chancellor\". Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the nominal head of a university  is\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChancellor whose functions are mainly statutory and\r\n\r\nceremonial. The administrative and academic head of\r\n\r\na  university is the Vice-Chancellor whose duty  it\r\n\r\nis   to  conduct  the  day-to-day  affairs   of   a\r\n\r\nuniversity. In Chinese universities, however, there\r\n\r\nis  no  post  corresponding to that of a Chancellor\r\n\r\nand   in  Nanyang  University  there  is  also   no\r\n\r\nprovision for such a post. Consequently, the  Vice-Chancellor  of Nanyang University is designated  in\r\n\r\nChinese as \"Head of the University\", that is,  Seow\r\n\r\nChang,  and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor is known  in\r\n\r\nChinese as \"Deputy Head of the University\", Fu Seow\r\n\r\nChang,  which  in  fact describe  their  respective\r\n\r\nfunctions accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite sympathise with the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong's concern over the question  of\r\n\r\nrecognition of Nanyang University degrees. In fact,\r\n\r\nthis  question has been receiving the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government for quite a considerable  time.  At\r\n\r\nthe  last convocation ceremony held in May 1967,  I\r\n\r\ndid   make   a  statement  that  the  question   of\r\n\r\nrecognition would be resolved in about two or three\r\n\r\nyears'  time.  However, judging from  the  rare  of\r\n\r\nprogress  in  the University, both in the  academic\r\n\r\nfield  as  well as in University organisation,  and\r\n\r\nalso judging by the better qualified staff that are\r\n\r\nbeing  recruited at the moment, I am quite prepared\r\n\r\nto  say that the question of recognition of Nanyang\r\n\r\ndegrees  would be resolved by the next convocation,\r\n\r\nmuch   earlier   than   what   I   had   originally\r\n\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been\r\n\r\ngiven  a detailed explanation of a system that  was\r\n\r\ninstituted by the previous Government and which led\r\n\r\nto  so  many anomalies in the salary scales of  the\r\n\r\nteaching  profession.

Why  is\r\n\r\nthis so? I have no doubt the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to give good reasons for  this.  But\r\n\r\nhaving  good  reasons  for  the  present  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  is one thing and finding means to  improve\r\n\r\nthe situation is another. It is to be noted that 25\r\n\r\nper cent of our Budget, which is equivalent to $151\r\n\r\nmillion, is to be expended on education. If we  are\r\n\r\nto  get  equitable returns for this  large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  spent,  and more important,  if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nensure that our younger generation will grow up  to\r\n\r\nbe well-educated, well-trained and well-disciplined\r\n\r\ncitizens of the future, then we must see to it that\r\n\r\nevery  child in school is given good education  and\r\n\r\nthat  every teacher is of the right calibre and  is\r\n\r\nplaying  his expected role in our education system.\r\n\r\nThat  this  is  not  so  is seen  in  the  apparent\r\n\r\ndisparity  in  educational standards between  aided\r\n\r\nschools and Government schools generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the factors responsible for this\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory state of affairs is the  quality  of\r\n\r\nteachers   taken  in  by  the  Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege. At one time, due to the rapid increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  number  of schools and due to the shortage  of\r\n\r\nsuitably  qualified  personnel  to  be  trained  as\r\n\r\nteachers, the Teachers' Training College had little\r\n\r\nchoice. The situation is now quite different.  With\r\n\r\nthe  large  number of Senior Cambridge  and  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool  graduates coming into the employment market\r\n\r\nevery year, it is now possible to recruit teachers-in-training   who  are  not  only  well   qualified\r\n\r\nacademically  but  also capable  and  dedicated  in\r\n\r\nmoulding   the  children  to  become   useful   and\r\n\r\nresponsible  citizens. In this  respect,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of teachers must first be re-examined.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  my  intention  to criticise  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  for  the members of which  I  have  the\r\n\r\nhighest regard, and indeed there are a good  number\r\n\r\nof  teachers who are above reproach. The House will\r\n\r\nno doubt agree that wearing tight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njeans  and  drain-pipe trousers and the keeping  of\r\n\r\nlong hair by teachers are not good examples for the\r\n\r\nchildren.  These  and  other undesirable  forms  of\r\n\r\nconduct  of some teachers during school  hours  are\r\n\r\nfrowned  upon  not  only by  parents  but  also  by\r\n\r\nrespected  and  dedicated  members  of  the   noble\r\n\r\nprofession. I therefore urge that such elements  be\r\n\r\nseriously  looked into by the Minister. I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that any measures taken by him will have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the parents and the teachers'  unions,\r\n\r\nfor  this  will  help to preserve the  dignity  and\r\n\r\nrespect of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, I agree with many\r\n\r\nof the remarks made by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> I\r\n\r\nstrongly agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I can assure him that every\r\n\r\npossible step is being taken to improve the quality\r\n\r\nof teachers.

I do not think  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  enough  time in this House  to  dwell  in\r\n\r\ndetail  on the factors. But suffice it to say  that\r\n\r\naided schools, as a whole, have a more stable staff\r\n\r\nas  the  teachers are not liable to be  transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  school  to school and, in many respects,  the\r\n\r\nteaching staff are more dedicated, if not for other\r\n\r\nreasons, at least for their own survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Anson that the\r\n\r\nstandard of education in schools depends to a large\r\n\r\nextent on the quality of the teachers and, in  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  various  steps have  been  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to ensure that the teachers recruited  are\r\n\r\nof  a  high  quality and that those who  have  been\r\n\r\nrecruited  in the past will be brought  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsane  level. For this, various kinds of  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses   are  being  organised  by  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the appearance of teachers in schools, I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Anson will recall that at  the\r\n\r\nsitting  of  Parliament  in  September,  I  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  teachers should dress decorously rather  than\r\n\r\ndecoratively.   Subsequent  to  that,   I   had   a\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  all  the  teachers'   unions   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  am  glad to say  that  all  of  them\r\n\r\nexpressed  support.

Therefore, I would\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister to increase the allocation for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan  in view of the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nparents there are in the low salary bracket and  in\r\n\r\norder  that children who deserve to get free  text-books can continue their education in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the school enrolment will\r\n\r\nincrease  by  about  15,000  next  year   and   the\r\n\r\nprovision for the free text-book scheme is the same\r\n\r\nfor  1967.

But we are  aware\r\n\r\nthat  certain  policies have not been carried  out,\r\n\r\none  of  which  relates to teacher training.  Every\r\n\r\nyear,  we  spend  quite a large  sum  of  money  on\r\n\r\nteacher   training.  We  know  that  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College, apart from providing training  in\r\n\r\nteaching   methods,  has  not  provided  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant kind of training, namely, the development\r\n\r\nof  the  outlook of teachers. In view of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  has  been independent  for  nearly\r\n\r\nthree  years  now, we would like  all  students  to\r\n\r\nrealise that this country belongs to them.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  very  important that we  should  instil\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness in their minds. It  follows\r\n\r\nthat  the trainee teachers must also be imbued with\r\n\r\nthis  quality, otherwise the minds of their  pupils\r\n\r\nwill  not he instilled with national consciousness.\r\n\r\nI  remember  that  not  long  ago  certain  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools did quite well in this aspect of education,\r\n\r\nand they instilled a feeling of patriotism in their\r\n\r\npupils. Of course, many schools are teaching civics\r\n\r\nand other subjects pertaining to patriotism, but if\r\n\r\nthe  trainee  teachers themselves are not  properly\r\n\r\ntaught  in this respect, they will not cut  a  good\r\n\r\nimage  with their students. I would like  to  quote\r\n\r\nfrom the booklet \"The Tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAhead - P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan 1959-1964\" under the\r\n\r\nchapter  of \"Spring Source of Our Nation\"  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  certain  policies or measures have  not  been\r\n\r\ncarried out:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers must therefore realise the important\r\n\r\nrole   they  play  in  the  building  of  a  united\r\n\r\ndemocratic Malayan nation. And they must learn that\r\n\r\ntheir duties do not end with the imparting of text-book  knowledge.  They have a whole  generation  of\r\n\r\nchildren  to mould into a national pattern.  To  do\r\n\r\nthis  successfully,  they themselves  must  acquire\r\n\r\nthose social values and convictions which they will\r\n\r\nhave to impart to the young. It is unlikely that we\r\n\r\nshall  succeed in building a Malayan nation  unless\r\n\r\nteachers   know   exactly  what  this   means   and\r\n\r\nunderstand exactly what they have to do.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  I  feel that now that  we  have  gained\r\n\r\nindependence, our young generation must  be  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  national  consciousness and the  persons  who\r\n\r\nteach them are the teachers. But there is a lack of\r\n\r\nsuch  training  for teachers. They themselves  have\r\n\r\nnot  realised the important task of education. They\r\n\r\ntreat  it as a means of livelihood and not as their\r\n\r\nvocation  or  as part of their duties.  They  treat\r\n\r\ntheir  work in the same routine manner as the civil\r\n\r\nservants.  The  Teachers' Training  College  should\r\n\r\ninstitute such training in the courses for teachers\r\n\r\nin the coming year so that our young generation can\r\n\r\nbetter absorb social values and convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect in the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\neducational policy which has not been carried  out,\r\n\r\nnamely, the main objective of training our students\r\n\r\nto  become  useful citizens so that they can  adapt\r\n\r\nthemselves to our economic policies and the task of\r\n\r\nnation  building. They will be the next  generation\r\n\r\nwho  will  lay down the foundations of a  socialist\r\n\r\nsociety.  If our industrial capacity is weak,  this\r\n\r\nis  because  of  the educational policy  under  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  regime which was very backward. In  order\r\n\r\nto  expand  our industry and economy, we must  make\r\n\r\nfull  use  of our talents. A nation can exist  only\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has  the capacity to produce  all  the\r\n\r\nmaterial  resources and goods to feed  its  people.\r\n\r\nSingapore does not produce any natural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  and, therefore, our productive  capacity\r\n\r\nmust  be  fully  geared to the utilisation  of  our\r\n\r\nhuman  resources.  Our  educational  policy  should\r\n\r\nplace  emphasis on the training of people in  order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  such  an  objective.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nschools  in  various parts of the  island  and  all\r\n\r\nchildren of school-going age are assured of a place\r\n\r\nin school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the P.A.P. came to power, the objective\r\n\r\nwas   not  to  produce  white-collar  workers.  Our\r\n\r\nobjective is to produce technicians. But up to date\r\n\r\nthere  is a lack of technical schools and technical\r\n\r\ntraining for our pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This  cannot be denied. But there  is  still\r\n\r\nroom for improvement. For instance, the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson has mentioned just now that our aided schools\r\n\r\nhave  achieved a better performance than Government\r\n\r\nschools. Why is this so? Why does the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation send those selected by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.C. to Chinese schools and they are regarded not\r\n\r\nas  Government  servants,  whereas  those  who  are\r\n\r\nselected  by  the P.S.C, and sent to other  schools\r\n\r\nare   regarded  as  Government  servants?  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  give  me a satisfactory reply?  Also  why\r\n\r\ndoes the Ministry not allow other aided schools  to\r\n\r\nbe  developed  into  Government schools?  Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  our  aided schools can  do  better  than\r\n\r\nGovernment schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point is that in certain integrated\r\n\r\nschools,  some of which are having three  languages\r\n\r\nand some two languages, the principals sent to them\r\n\r\nnormally can speak only one language. For instance,\r\n\r\nin   an  integrated  school  where  there  are  two\r\n\r\nlanguages, English and Chinese, the principal  sent\r\n\r\nto  this  school is conversant only in English,  or\r\n\r\nconversant  only in Chinese. Thus, the  results  of\r\n\r\nsuch an appointment will not be very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of political study  courses  for\r\n\r\ntrainee  teachers is important. In fact,  this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  for  the last two or three  years.  All\r\n\r\nteachers-in-training in the T.T.C. attend a 30-hour\r\n\r\ncourse  on  civics  and government,  and  full-time\r\n\r\nstudents  attend  a  90-hour  course  on  political\r\n\r\nstudies.  These courses have recently been  revised\r\n\r\nwith  the  aim of focusing attention on Singapore's\r\n\r\ncurrent  political, social, economic  and  cultural\r\n\r\nproblems.

Dark and thundery\r\n\r\nclouds have threatened to blacken this shining  and\r\n\r\nfriendly  skyline and claps of rumbling  discontent\r\n\r\nhave echoed occasionally through the columns of our\r\n\r\ndaily newspaper. I see that my colleague, the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tampines, has been exposed to  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  outbursts  and  has, with  great  dexterity,\r\n\r\nmanaged  to dodge the scathing and sarcastic  bolts\r\n\r\nfrom  the  pestle and mortar of the  pharmaceutical\r\n\r\ncolleagues.   This  eternal  and   purely   locally\r\n\r\npeculiar dispute of our qualified pharmacists is in\r\n\r\nmany  ways understandable as being suitably trained\r\n\r\nin  the  art  of  pharmacy. They feel  they  should\r\n\r\ninherit  the useful and sometimes mystifying  world\r\n\r\nof  drugs and dispensing. I, as a medical  man,  do\r\n\r\nnot  begrudge  them their rights  of  dealing  with\r\n\r\ndrugs. I am rather sad to see so much encouragement\r\n\r\nhas  been  given to the idea of producing  as  many\r\n\r\npharmacists as possible from our University without\r\n\r\none iota of thought being given to the consequences\r\n\r\nif   the  markets  for  qualified  pharmacists   in\r\n\r\nSingapore should become saturated.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, judging from this dispute, I\r\n\r\nfeel our small island has probably reached this\r\n\r\nsaturation point so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour qualified pharmacists are now feeling the pinch\r\n\r\nof  not  being able to find enough jobs to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  position  in our society.  Something  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  done to absorb this surplus,  and  I\r\n\r\nfeel  the Ministry of Health should be able  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  I note that only 35 pharmacists are  in  the\r\n\r\nemployment of the Ministry. This surely is  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall number in the health service which covers the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  our island.

Because it is essentially a male committee\r\n\r\nand   so   there  should  always  be  some   female\r\n\r\nrepresentation. I will, however, try to take up two\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Joo Chiat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned that the University of Singapore\r\n\r\nappears  to be producing more graduates in pharmacy\r\n\r\nthan there are jobs available for them. It was with\r\n\r\nthis  in mind that the fourth term of reference  of\r\n\r\nthe committee was as follows. I quote:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'From the available facts and having: regard to\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations made on the above [that is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the  other three terms of reference for  this\r\n\r\ncommittee on the pharmaceutical profession and  the\r\n\r\ndispensing   of   medicine],   to   estimate    the\r\n\r\nrequirements   for   qualified   pharmacists    for\r\n\r\nSingapore  for, say, the next five years from  1968\r\n\r\nto 1972.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  it  will come within the terms of reference  of\r\n\r\nthis  committee who, I think, would be in the  best\r\n\r\nposition  to assess, first, the number of graduates\r\n\r\nalready in Singapore, and how many of them may  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to find employment easily, and  therefore\r\n\r\nwhat  we  should do for the foreseeable five  years\r\n\r\nahead. So I hope the Member for Joo Chiat will be a\r\n\r\nwee  bit  patient as I anticipate that  the  report\r\n\r\nwill be ready perhaps within a month or so when  it\r\n\r\nwill be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Government should try to\r\n\r\nemploy  more  than  35  pharmacists  - we,  the  big\r\n\r\nemployer, the model employer, how about giving more\r\n\r\njobs  to  pharmacists - I think one has  got  to  be\r\n\r\ncareful there. No graduate of our University should\r\n\r\nfeel  that  once  he graduates and qualifies,  then\r\n\r\nautomatically   there  is  a   job   available   in\r\n\r\nGovernment service. I think that would  be  a  very\r\n\r\ndangerous  assumption.  I  believe  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould   employ   a  percentage  of   each   year's\r\n\r\ngraduates,  but  surely not in order  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nunemployment   situation.  I  do  hope   that   the\r\n\r\ncommittee  would  recommend that  Government  would\r\n\r\nemploy more qualified pharmacists than has been the\r\n\r\ncase  previously.  But, Sir, I hate  to  anticipate\r\n\r\nwhat  the  committee's findings will be,  and  here\r\n\r\nagain  I  would  prefer to wait and  see  what  the\r\n\r\nreport is like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Government will then be in a position to\r\n\r\nexpress views on the committee's report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the\r\n\r\nMinister's explanation, and therefore I withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The first one is that  it  is\r\n\r\nknown  that  over  the  past year  the  density  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes in Singapore has risen tremendously.  It\r\n\r\nis  also  known  that, based upon a  recent  survey\r\n\r\nconducted  by  some  officers of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  about 51 per cent of the septic  tanks  of\r\n\r\nthe  housing  estates  in  Singapore  are  breeding\r\n\r\ngrounds for mosquitoes. I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to know what the Minister is able to  say  on\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that huge colonies of rats\r\n\r\nhave  made the Kandang Kerbau Market their habitat.\r\n\r\nIs  it possible for the Public Health Inspectors to\r\n\r\ndo something about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree that\r\n\r\nthe  mosquito density in Singapore has been on  the\r\n\r\nincrease.  This has been so not only  recently  but\r\n\r\nover   a   period  of  time.  There   are   various\r\n\r\nexplanations  for  this  unfortunate  situation.  I\r\n\r\nthink it can be said that while Singapore has  been\r\n\r\nfortunate in that, although we are situated  within\r\n\r\na  malarial  region that extends  for  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nmiles  around  us,  Singapore  is  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nmalaria  free.  We have been able  to  conquer  the\r\n\r\nmalarial  scourge although we are in the  heart  of\r\n\r\nthis  area.  We  do  occasionally  have  cases   of\r\n\r\nmalaria, about 100 to 200 cases per year, when they\r\n\r\nget  hospitalised. But these are generally imported\r\n\r\ncases.  They got the infection somewhere else,  and\r\n\r\nthen when they come here they have the fever. It is\r\n\r\ndiagnosed as malaria and then they are treated. But\r\n\r\nall    this   while   the   department   has   been\r\n\r\nconcentrating  on  what is known  as  anti-malarial\r\n\r\nwork, leaving aside the other mosquitoes which  can\r\n\r\nbe  just as troublesome, just calling them nuisance\r\n\r\nmosquitoes. This problem has been deteriorating for\r\n\r\nsome  time  for various reasons, partly because  of\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  development of Singapore  with  housing\r\n\r\nestates  where trees have been lopped off  and  the\r\n\r\ndrainage is bad. In fact, in Singapore all that  is\r\n\r\nneeded is just a wee bit of water to be left for  a\r\n\r\nweek,  and  it is possible to breed mosquitoes.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a situation where the drainage is bad. It  is\r\n\r\napplicable  almost everywhere in  Singapore.  There\r\n\r\nhas   also  been  a  deterioration  in  the  Public\r\n\r\nCleansing  Services. The situation is  worsened  by\r\n\r\nthousands of unlicensed hawkers, and sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  licensed  hawkers, throwing refuse  into  the\r\n\r\ndrains and clogging them up. We have, therefore,  a\r\n\r\nproblem which we have inherited with the passage of\r\n\r\ntime,  so  much so that it will, I am afraid,  take\r\n\r\nquite some time before we are in a position to  say\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore will be mosquito-free.  An  attempt\r\n\r\nhas   been  made  to  improve  the  public   health\r\n\r\nsituation in various parts of Singapore. We are  at\r\n\r\npresent concentrating on the city area. I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat,  unless the nuisance is very bad in the rural\r\n\r\nareas,  the concentration for the present  and  the\r\n\r\nnear future would be in the city, and then later on\r\n\r\nit will be extended to the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the question of septic tanks. This,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, does not come within the province of\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Health.  It  comes  within  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development under sewerage. We\r\n\r\nhave  taken up the matter with them and  the  reply\r\n\r\ngiven is that they will play their part by spraying\r\n\r\nanti-malarial oil on to these septic tanks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rat colonies, I think this is really\r\n\r\nan index of refuse in the particular place. I think\r\n\r\nthere  are  colonies of rats even in  the  best  of\r\n\r\ncities.  However,  I do not wish to  belittle  this\r\n\r\npublic health problem of what the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  says,  \"rat  colonies  in  Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nMarket\".  There  are rat colonies in  almost  every\r\n\r\nmarket. However, in view of his complaints, I shall\r\n\r\nget  my  department to try to do something more  in\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau  Market  to  exterminate  the   rat\r\n\r\ncolonies  as fast as we can and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nthis  problem if it is found to be of such a nature\r\n\r\nas to warrant further attacks in other markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, I am more than\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the answer given by  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nMay I beg leave to withdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of\r\n\r\nMadam Chan Choy Siong -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1125.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Is  it  possible\r\n\r\nnot  to  detain  deck passengers  unless  they  are\r\n\r\nsuspected  of having diseases? Sir, all  passengers\r\n\r\nfrom foreign countries who come by boat or aircraft\r\n\r\nshould  have their health certificates. This  being\r\n\r\nso, I can see no reason why they should be isolated\r\n\r\nfor  three days. I do not know whether the Minister\r\n\r\nis  aware that certain deck passengers who come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore disembark at Penang, because there is  no\r\n\r\nquarantine  in Penang, and these passengers  arrive\r\n\r\nin  Singapore even before the saloon passengers  of\r\n\r\nthe  same ship disembark at Singapore. Sir, if  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  detaining  deck  passengers  is   to\r\n\r\nprevent  diseases from spreading,  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nbeing  defeated  for  the  reasons  I  have  stated\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, can the Minister consider\r\n\r\nabolishing   the  quarantine  detention   of   deck\r\n\r\npassengers  who  are not suspected  of  having  any\r\n\r\nepidemic   diseases?

Our quarantine station  is\r\n\r\nsituated  at  St. John's Island, which  is  a  very\r\n\r\nbeautiful  island indeed. I do agree that sometimes\r\n\r\nconditions may not be as good as one would want and\r\n\r\nthere  could  be room for improvement.  The  Member\r\n\r\nsays   that  the  inmates,  when  placed   in   the\r\n\r\nquarantine station, would be subject to threats  of\r\n\r\ninsects like centipedes. I think even we, who  live\r\n\r\non  the  fair island of Singapore, are  subject  to\r\n\r\nthis.   It  could  happen.  There  are  centipedes,\r\n\r\nlizards, and so on occasionally, but I have not had\r\n\r\nany  reports  to  this effect. If there  have  been\r\n\r\nreports,  I would expect that the matter  has  been\r\n\r\nlooked into.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I consider as a question which needs a\r\n\r\nfuller answer is the Member's suggestion that  deck\r\n\r\npassengers,    when   they   come    with    health\r\n\r\ncertificates,  should be exempted from  quarantine.\r\n\r\nThis  is what exactly health certificates are meant\r\n\r\nfor.  When people travel from country A to  country\r\n\r\nB,  they  should be in possession of  valid  health\r\n\r\ncertificates. But I am afraid that there have  been\r\n\r\noccasions when such certificates have been  forged.\r\n\r\nIn  those circumstances, it is not possible for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  to relax regulations  because\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  situated among  countries  that  are\r\n\r\nhabitually  endemic  with very  serious  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases.  We cannot accept a situation where  just\r\n\r\nallowing  one  case to slip through with  a  forged\r\n\r\ncertificate, as happened in 1949, would have caused\r\n\r\na spread of small-pox which would then endanger not\r\n\r\njust  the health but the lives of thousands of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Let me give an example, Sir, of  the  real\r\n\r\nthreat which Singapore faces daily. I refer to  our\r\n\r\nGovernment   Gazette   which  regularly   publishes\r\n\r\nstatements  of quarantine notifications of  serious\r\n\r\ninfectious   diseases   which   are   current    in\r\n\r\nneighbouring   countries.

However,\r\n\r\nthere are defects which can be found and need to be\r\n\r\nimproved  in  the  administration  of  the   Public\r\n\r\nCleansing  Department. Workers in  this  department\r\n\r\nwork to rule in specified areas without giving  due\r\n\r\nattention to the rubbish which cannot be cleared on\r\n\r\nthat  particular  day. This will  be  a  source  of\r\n\r\ndanger to public health. I have come across rubbish\r\n\r\ndumps  which stench. It is more so if it is on  the\r\n\r\nevening  of  a Saturday. And then if  Monday  is  a\r\n\r\npublic  holiday, the situation is aggravated.  Such\r\n\r\nrubbish  dumps  are heaped up and  they  block  the\r\n\r\nroads. This causes a traffic jam in that particular\r\n\r\nstreet.  This has happened in Changi Road  opposite\r\n\r\nChangi  Market,  and  at  Geylang  Serai  near  the\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai Market. This goes to prove that  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Cleansing  Department  cannot  control  its\r\n\r\nworkers.  This  will endanger  the  health  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to complain to the health\r\n\r\nofficers  at  Katong  over  the  telephone  and  my\r\n\r\ncomplaints have been accepted in good faith. But  I\r\n\r\nregret  to  say that only for a certain  period  of\r\n\r\ntime  were  the health standards maintained.  After\r\n\r\nthat, the former bad state of affairs continued.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that so long as the administration  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  is  not  reorganised,  this  state   of\r\n\r\naffairs will continue in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to say is that in Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  there  are  many  drains  which  have   been\r\n\r\nneglected. One or two drains may have been  cleaned\r\n\r\nby the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers,  say, once in four months or once  in  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  As Geylang Serai is a low-lying  area,  if\r\n\r\nthe  drains are not cleaned, the water will  remain\r\n\r\nstagnant  and  this  will be a breeding-ground  for\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  I  believe the problem  of  mosquitoes\r\n\r\ncannot  be  controlled until and unless the  drains\r\n\r\nare  flushed. I hope the Minister for  Health  will\r\n\r\nconsider  this  matter so that the  health  of  the\r\n\r\npublic can be looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Geylang Serai that the public health\r\n\r\nconditions in Geylang Serai are not as good  as  we\r\n\r\nwould  want them to be. But there are a  number  of\r\n\r\nhistorical factors, some of which have already been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by the Member himself when he said  that\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai is a low-lying area. If it  is  low-lying,  therefore, deep drainage is difficult,  and\r\n\r\ndrainage  comes within the jurisdiction of  another\r\n\r\nMinistry.  But  somehow or  other  we  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nsaddled  with  all  the  complaints  which  we  try\r\n\r\npainfully to carry on our shoulders. If an area  is\r\n\r\nlow-lying  and  waste water cannot  flow,  then  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  stagnant water, and within a  week  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  easy  for  a mosquito to lay eggs  and  there\r\n\r\nwould  be larvae and then mosquitoes. So the  basic\r\n\r\nproblem is how to drain an area well. I think it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to take a lot of effort on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development to try  to  drain\r\n\r\nall  our  low-lying areas well so that  water  will\r\n\r\nflow readily, easily and, therefore, there will  be\r\n\r\nless breeding-places for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Member for Geylang Serai will\r\n\r\nappreciate that most of the drains in Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nare not concrete drains which are found in most  of\r\n\r\nthe  built-up areas, but they are earth drains.  In\r\n\r\nother words, a few feet of earth have been dug away\r\n\r\nand  water is allowed to flow in, which means  that\r\n\r\nif there is a bit of rain or when there is a bit of\r\n\r\nflooding, the sides of the earth drain go into  the\r\n\r\ndrain   itself  and  therefore  greater  stagnation\r\n\r\nresults.  These  are problems of engineering.  They\r\n\r\nneed  more than just putting anti-malarial oil into\r\n\r\nthe drains to prevent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  from  laying  their  eggs  and   larva-hatching. These are serious problems and I think my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Minister  for  Law  and   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  and his Ministry have indicated  that\r\n\r\nit  will  take some time before they can deal  with\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards public cleansing for which I assume\r\n\r\nfull  responsibility, I myself have visited Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  Market as announced three weeks ago. I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  am very dissatisfied with the  public\r\n\r\nhealth   conditions   of  this   market   and   its\r\n\r\nsurroundings. But whatever it is, I think it  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  improvement on what it was some months  ago,\r\n\r\nbefore  the overhead bridge was built across Changi\r\n\r\nRoad at the junction of Changi Road/Joo Chiat Road,\r\n\r\nwhen it was necessary to resettle a large number of\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  had congregated around this  junction\r\n\r\nand outside not only Geylang Serai Market, but also\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat  and Changi Markets. I think  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a great improvement. Thanks to the assistance\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Geylang Serai and the Member for\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat, an attempt has been made to bring order\r\n\r\nout of chaos at this junction. Things have improved\r\n\r\nconsiderably but it must be admitted that there  is\r\n\r\nstill a lot more to be done. When I visited Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  Market,  which  was  built  at  a  cost   of\r\n\r\n$400,000, I saw refuse all around the market, and a\r\n\r\nlot of refuse on its roof thrown down by tenants of\r\n\r\nmulti-storeyed flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ridiculous state of affairs - people\r\n\r\nliving in flats just throwing rubbish outside their\r\n\r\nbackyards on to the roof of a Government market. It\r\n\r\nhas  been cleaned before. So we are dealing with  a\r\n\r\nsituation where the public are responsible for  the\r\n\r\nrefuse  and  not playing their part  by  having  it\r\n\r\nplaced  in chutes specially meant for the  disposal\r\n\r\nof  refuse. When we have a situation like  this,  I\r\n\r\nthink it will take some time to educate the public.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  I  have  to get  more  work  and  more\r\n\r\nefficiency out of my work force. They will play\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  part.  If ever the Member for Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nhas  a complaint to make - and he should make it not\r\n\r\nby  just  ringing up the Health Officer for Katong,\r\n\r\nwhich  he has done, but by letting me know - I  will\r\n\r\nsee  that  he is relatively satisfied, as I  cannot\r\n\r\npromise him that Geylang Serai will be very  clean,\r\n\r\nbut it will certainly be much cleaner than what  it\r\n\r\nis  today. He did indicate that there is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nrefuse  on  Saturday evening, that it is  worse  on\r\n\r\nSunday,  and still worse on Monday if Monday  is  a\r\n\r\nholiday. We have stopped the overtime racket of the\r\n\r\nPublic Cleansing Department early this year. It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we  wanted to break the  racket  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were  misled  into a  strike.  Now  having\r\n\r\nbroken  it,  I  think it will be  very  foolish  to\r\n\r\nrevert  back to Sunday and public holiday  work  at\r\n\r\ndouble and triple pay. I do not think this will  be\r\n\r\nre-introduced so long as our work force is able  to\r\n\r\nperform its functions thoroughly during week  days.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  the policy of the Cleansing Department\r\n\r\nthat  if  there  is  a public holiday  following  a\r\n\r\nSunday, work will be done on the public holiday. In\r\n\r\nother  words, there will be no refuse  lying  about\r\n\r\nuncollected for 48 hours. But we do want to  instil\r\n\r\ninto our work force the fact that they will work on\r\n\r\nSaturdays, that there is no work on Sundays  unless\r\n\r\nit is really very, very necessary and that if there\r\n\r\nis a holiday on a Monday, they are expected to work\r\n\r\non  that day. So the situation of refuse left lying\r\n\r\nabout for 48 hours will never arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  explain that the earth drains are  choked\r\n\r\nand  full  of  rubbish and brush. If  they  can  be\r\n\r\ncleaned,  at least the filth in the drains  can  be\r\n\r\nreduced somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yong, do you wish to say\r\n\r\nanything  in reply to that?

Exactly, sometimes\r\n\r\nthe grass on the sides is cut and chucked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the  drains. When grass is cut, it should  be\r\n\r\ntaken away. This adds to the rubbish that goes into\r\n\r\nthe  drains. Everything is thrown into  the  drains - tins,  bottles, grass and boxes. So if the  public\r\n\r\nare  so  irresponsible as to keep on  piling  these\r\n\r\nthings,  there  is  a  limit  to  what  our  public\r\n\r\ncleansing workers can get rid of. So I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  blame  should be put on just our workers.  The\r\n\r\nblame  must be put on the irresponsible members  of\r\n\r\nthe public whom we have to educate, and perhaps  in\r\n\r\ntime  if  persuasion fails, I will have to ask  for\r\n\r\npowers to fine them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1741.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members have spoken at length on\r\n\r\nmosquito larvae, rubbish thrown into drains  and  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  other complaints.

In this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to make a suggestion. Since  the  fault\r\n\r\ndoes  not  lie with the actions of just one  person\r\n\r\nalone,  and it is not the responsibility of anyone,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to see a campaign conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  - a  campaign  against  filth,\r\n\r\npests,  mosquitoes and the throwing of rubbish  - in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with other relevant organisations.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  there  should be  something  like  a\r\n\r\ntripartite organisation to conduct this campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said some time ago that there was a plan under way to launch a public campaign to promote cleanliness, and so on, but so far this has not materialised. I hope he will launch it to clean up our city.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Delta for suggesting this anti-movement, anti-this,   anti-that,  and  so  on.  We  have   health\r\n\r\neducation  in  the  Ministry  of  Health.   We   do\r\n\r\nunderstand   and  appreciate  that  education   and\r\n\r\npersuasion are important. I have been in charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education for one term of 4\ufffd years\r\n\r\nand  I  know that education takes time - not  just  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of months. Human cussedness being  what  it\r\n\r\nis, it may perhaps take years before people can  be\r\n\r\ntrained to do the things we want them to do. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  that  because we have  a  movement  that\r\n\r\nwithin  three  or six months, there  will  be  less\r\n\r\nmosquitoes. It will have to take a longer period of\r\n\r\ntime - years - before the results can be seen. So  we\r\n\r\nhave not lost sight of the importance of education.\r\n\r\nIt  is  being  done,  sometimes  very  quietly  and\r\n\r\nwithout  fanfare. This has not been a section  that\r\n\r\nhas   been  sleeping.  I  think  it  has   done   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount of work - public cleansing  for\r\n\r\nwhat  it is worth over radio and on TV, and in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Anti-malarial work is being  done  not\r\n\r\nthroughout  the whole of Singapore but  in  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies, like Geylang West,  Tanjong  Pagar,\r\n\r\nAnson, Telok Ayer and now Hong Lim. We are tackling\r\n\r\nthe  problem of public health in toto, not only the\r\n\r\nlicensing   of  thousands  of  hawkers   in   these\r\n\r\nconstituencies   but   also   the   clearance    of\r\n\r\nunauthorised structures over drains used by hawkers\r\n\r\nand  also  by members of the public, the unslabbing\r\n\r\nof  drains, drains which have been covered up  over\r\n\r\nthe  last five or ten years to look pretty in order\r\n\r\nto  allow hawkers to carry on with their trade, but\r\n\r\nwhich   increase  the  problems  of  public  health\r\n\r\nbecause underneath, these slabbed drains are choked\r\n\r\nwith  refuse. Water cannot flow through  them.  All\r\n\r\nthis  is not done in just a matter of months.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  legacy of years of neglect and it will  take\r\n\r\nyears of determined action not by just the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health but by even the Ministry of Education. We\r\n\r\nare  now  instilling into our young in schools  the\r\n\r\nway to behave and how not to litter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaygrounds and class-rooms.

This is correct. This year,  the  sum\r\n\r\nallocated  to  the  Ministry  of  Health  is  quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial.

We  will\r\n\r\nfirst  give them a warning; we will fine  them  the\r\n\r\nsecond time; and we will cancel their licences  the\r\n\r\nthird  time. It is only by going about  this  in  a\r\n\r\nstrict  way  that  we can make  a  success  of  our\r\n\r\nadministration.

He  first started with the  Geylang  West\r\n\r\nConstituency, then the Anson Constituency, and then\r\n\r\nthe Tanjong Pagar Constituency. But I was told that\r\n\r\nthe Minister also intends to reorganise the hawkers\r\n\r\nin  the  Telok  Ayer  Constituency.  While  he  has\r\n\r\nimproved   the  hawker  situation  generally,   the\r\n\r\nproblem  now is that some of the hawkers  in  these\r\n\r\nconstituencies feel that they have been  especially\r\n\r\nsingled out for licensing procedures, whereas their\r\n\r\ncounter-parts in other constituencies are  free  to\r\n\r\nconduct  their  petty trading without  restriction.\r\n\r\nThe result is that hawkers who are granted licences\r\n\r\nfor  pitches in these constituencies have  migrated\r\n\r\nto the free zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me to be unfair to the hawkers in\r\n\r\nthese  constituencies  to  subject  them  to  rigid\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  while  others  are  spared   of   this\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Therefore, I call upon  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nsuspend  disciplinary measures against the licensed\r\n\r\nhawkers until such time as the licensing system can\r\n\r\nbe  applied  universally to all hawkers  throughout\r\n\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In places where the licensing of hawkers has\r\n\r\nbegun,  there seem to be more hawkers than  before.\r\n\r\nThis  means  that each licensed hawker can  now  do\r\n\r\nless  business  than before. Therefore,  I  propose\r\n\r\nthat the licence fees for day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  be reduced from $10 to $6 and  those  for\r\n\r\nnight business be reduced from $20 to $12. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  may be aware of the fact  that  some\r\n\r\nhawkers are unable to pay their licence fees due to\r\n\r\nlack of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Though  at\r\n\r\npresent  the  hawkers  are  being  reorganised  and\r\n\r\nresited,  they  will  continue  to  exist,  if  not\r\n\r\nflourish, owing to our social and economic reasons.\r\n\r\nThey  have  in the past indeed provided  convenient\r\n\r\nservices  to the people and have been a great  help\r\n\r\nto those who are unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one will probably agree with me that if\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  going to become a garden  city,  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  will have the duty to co-operate with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. It is a well-known fact that among  the\r\n\r\nhawkers where the food is good, the place is always\r\n\r\nless  desirable. Here, I would like to  name  three\r\n\r\nlocalities just as examples. (1) Beach Road,  where\r\n\r\nthe  satay is good, everything is good; but  whilst\r\n\r\nthe  mouth  is  tasting the good  satay,  the  nose\r\n\r\nsmells  something  unpleasant  and  the  feet   are\r\n\r\nresting in dust and mud. (2) New Bridge Road,  just\r\n\r\noutside  the Chinese Tong Chai Medical Hall,  there\r\n\r\nare  at least 20 different types of food. Excellent\r\n\r\nfood  it  is. There may be new stools, new  tables,\r\n\r\nbut before one can really sit down, one has already\r\n\r\nkicked so many craters in the compound. And  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes not fall, he will probably fall whilst sitting\r\n\r\non  a stool which is standing on uneven ground. (3)\r\n\r\nHokien Street, where the hawkers specialise in  the\r\n\r\nfamous palatable Hokien wee and quick service, they\r\n\r\nopen till early in the morning. But the environment\r\n\r\nand chairs and tables often curtail one's enjoyment\r\n\r\nof the food ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I am afraid we are not\r\n\r\nin   a   position   to  reorganise   all   the   51\r\n\r\nconstituencies at one time. That is why we have  to\r\n\r\ngo  in stages. There is no question of singling out\r\n\r\nany  of the hawkers. The worst situation is in  the\r\n\r\ncity area. So I am afraid we cannot suspend action,\r\n\r\nbecause if we did, we might as well do nothing, and\r\n\r\ngo back to chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also afraid that it is not possible to\r\n\r\nconsider a reduction of licence fees, because  they\r\n\r\nare already nominal. How much more nominal fees  do\r\n\r\nthe hawkers want? After all, we have to pay for the\r\n\r\nservices of the public cleansing workers.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  do  it  for  free;  neither  do  the  hawkers'\r\n\r\ninspectors. They have all got to be paid  salaries.\r\n\r\nAnd  the number of licences that have to be  issued - the  stationery involved - all this has got  to  be\r\n\r\npaid for.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statement made by the Member for\r\n\r\nTampines  that  nice  places for  hawker  food  are\r\n\r\nunfortunately not nice places for the nose. That is\r\n\r\nexactly   the  situation.  When  they   have   good\r\n\r\nbusiness,  they should be doing their  business  in\r\n\r\nproper shophouses where the surroundings are clean.\r\n\r\nThat is what we hope the future will bring - that by\r\n\r\nslowly  reorganising  the  hawkers,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nselling their food inside shop premises. Perhaps it\r\n\r\nwill  be a little more expensive than what  it  was\r\n\r\nbefore, but I think the public are prepared to  pay\r\n\r\na bit more for their food because they can enjoy it\r\n\r\nunder healthy hygienic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the reply of the Minister ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The answer is no. We are\r\n\r\nnot going to have any trade fairs in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nif  we  did, it would cost much more than $300,000.\r\n\r\nLet me inform Members of the House what is involved\r\n\r\nin  organising trade fairs. Last year a trade  fair\r\n\r\nwas held in Bangkok for the ECAFE region. Singapore\r\n\r\nwas given the first option to hold this trade fair.\r\n\r\nI  was  then  in the Finance Ministry, and  I  made\r\n\r\ninquiries  into the cost of holding  such  a  trade\r\n\r\nfair.  Experts from other countries were called  in\r\n\r\nand  they  had  a look at the possible  trade  fair\r\n\r\nground which was the old Kallang Airport. Estimates\r\n\r\nwere  made  of  the different kinds  of  facilities\r\n\r\nwhich  would be required of a world trade fair  for\r\n\r\nthe  ECAFE region and of a standard which ECAFE had\r\n\r\nin  mind.  The cost was something in the region  of\r\n\r\n$90   million  - the  whole  lot  to  be  borne   by\r\n\r\nSingapore. We do not have that kind of money and so\r\n\r\nwe  passed off this option, and the trade fair  was\r\n\r\nheld in Bangkok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, either in 1969 or 1970 there will be the\r\n\r\nOsaka  Expo, or an Exposition in Osaka. When I  was\r\n\r\nlast  in  Japan, I got in touch with the organisers\r\n\r\nof this Expo and asked them what, in their opinion,\r\n\r\nshould Singapore spend on its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npavilion  in the Osaka Expo, assuming  that  we  do\r\n\r\nparticipate in it.

In July 1961, there was held in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  Eighth Regional Conference  of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Parliamentary Association  where  the\r\n\r\nthen Minister for Education announced the offer  of\r\n\r\nten  special  scholarships each year  for  students\r\n\r\nfrom  Sabah  and Sarawak. These were  to  be  given\r\n\r\nspecial treatment by way of training places and the\r\n\r\nawards were to be known as \"Malaysia Scholarships\".\r\n\r\nA separate vote was created in 1963 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinance  them.  But  when we joined  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nterritories  of  Sabah  and  Sarawak  also   joined\r\n\r\nMalaysia simultaneously with us and technically  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  possible to award scholarships  to  these\r\n\r\nscholars from the Colombo Plan vote. So to overcome\r\n\r\nthis difficulty the Malaysia Scholarship scheme was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in a separate vote made  up  for  them.\r\n\r\nSince we left Malaysia in 1965, scholars from Sabah\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak  were again eligible for Colombo  Plan\r\n\r\nscholarships and, in fact, this would be the way in\r\n\r\nwhich   they   would  receive  their  training   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. So the present vote is really meant  for\r\n\r\nthe  15  scholarships awarded and  expected  to  be\r\n\r\noutstanding  in 1968. The amount of this  vote,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  will  diminish in course of  time  as  the\r\n\r\nscholars complete their studies and return to Sabah\r\n\r\nand Sarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3026*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr. Ng Yeow Chong.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sum of over $7 million has been entered\r\n\r\nfor the purchase of property for Overseas Missions.\r\n\r\nCan  I  ask  the  Minister what property  has  been\r\n\r\npurchased overseas so far, and what other  property\r\n\r\nhe  proposes to purchase with this sum of money and\r\n\r\nfrom where?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the following properties\r\n\r\nhave been purchased.

However,  the most urgent problem  today  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government is effectively controlling\r\n\r\nall  the  items of expenditure without  any  waste.\r\n\r\nSir,  I wish to mention some Government departments\r\n\r\nwhere  there  still exist a number of  problems.  I\r\n\r\nwill make use of this opportunity to list them  one\r\n\r\nby  one. For example, at the moment, there is still\r\n\r\nthe    problem   of   corruption   in    Government\r\n\r\ndepartments. It has not been completely eliminated.\r\n\r\nOf   course,   when  I  mention  this  problem   of\r\n\r\ncorruption, I must say that in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. policy in 1959 when we came to power, we did\r\n\r\ntry   to   eliminate  completely  the  problem   of\r\n\r\ncorruption. I can say that we have had some success\r\n\r\nin  this  task.  However, I  believe  this  problem\r\n\r\ncannot  be  completely eliminated in a short  time.\r\n\r\nCompared  to other countries, Singapore  is  better\r\n\r\nthan   them  a  hundred  times.  But  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not be complacent in dealing  with\r\n\r\nthis problem. As long as there is any corruption, I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government will try its best to eliminate\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the bureaucratic attitude\r\n\r\nof  public  servants is still prevalent in  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. Ever since the  Government\r\n\r\ncame  to  power, we have tried to eliminate  it  so\r\n\r\nthat  all  the  public servants can carry  out  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of our Government. As a result, the  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore have been praising the Government for\r\n\r\nthe  effective  measures taken. In each  department\r\n\r\nthere  should be a courteous atmosphere when  civil\r\n\r\nservants are dealing with the public. But I do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why this problem has gradually come back\r\n\r\nagain  in  every department. There  is  again  this\r\n\r\nattitude of discourtesy. If the Government does not\r\n\r\nbelieve this, I think every Minister should inspect\r\n\r\nthe various departments in his own Ministry, as was\r\n\r\ndone   before,  and  he  will  discover  that  this\r\n\r\nattitude  exists. The civil servants are  not  only\r\n\r\nimpolite  to  the  public but also  to  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament. They are impolite and do not regard  us\r\n\r\nas  Members  of Parliament. I am sure many  Members\r\n\r\nhave  had a similar experience and will agree  with\r\n\r\nwhat I have said. If we allow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  state  of affairs to continue,  then,  as  an\r\n\r\neffective  Government our policy will be  defeated.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  after our party  came  to  power,  a\r\n\r\ncourse  of  training was organised for  the  public\r\n\r\nservants. If this is the result of such a course of\r\n\r\ntraining, then I think such training was completely\r\n\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring up is the waste of\r\n\r\npublic  property. In many departments  some  public\r\n\r\nservants  are  very  careless in  using  Government\r\n\r\nproperty. They do not know how to economise. We all\r\n\r\nremember  that  we have to economise  public  funds\r\n\r\nbecause these funds come from the people. They have\r\n\r\nworked very hard for them. If we do not investigate\r\n\r\nthis  problem  carefully, then the task  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  will be endangered. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  carry  out a careful investigation  into  the\r\n\r\nproblems I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I note\r\n\r\nthat the estimate for this Ministry has reached the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  $57,776,690. This is about  $4  million\r\n\r\nmore  than for 1967. This means that this  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   expanded   and  there  are  more   items   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  In the past, this Ministry  has  made\r\n\r\ngreat  achievements in its work, such as the  issue\r\n\r\nof  new  currency, the expansion of new industries,\r\n\r\nand   effective  control  of  the  revenue  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  All these achievements should be  praised\r\n\r\nby  all.  Undoubtedly our present economic position\r\n\r\nis  very  sound and stable. Therefore, the  various\r\n\r\nschemes  and policies of the Government  have  been\r\n\r\nfully  implemented.  The  national  income  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  has also increased. This is because of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  improvement in the economic situation  and\r\n\r\nthe standard of living of our people. But it cannot\r\n\r\nbe  denied  that  there  are  certain  difficulties\r\n\r\nfacing   our   country,  namely,  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment. This has also been recognised by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  as the most serious challenge facing  us.\r\n\r\nHow  are we going to overcome this serious problem?\r\n\r\nI  feel that the Minister for Finance should  adopt\r\n\r\nbetter and more effective measures to deal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis and to expand industries, tourism and external\r\n\r\ntrade   in   order   to  solve  this   problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment step by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister a few\r\n\r\nquestions. First, whether he intends to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nprice control committee or bureau in the very  near\r\n\r\nfuture  in  order to control prices of goods.  This\r\n\r\nscheme  is  being practised in many  countries.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  the stabilisation of prices will  bring\r\n\r\nabout a peaceful and stable situation and keep  the\r\n\r\nsocial  order in manageable proportions.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nthere  will  be fluctuations in prices  which  will\r\n\r\ncause   a  lot  of  difficulties  to  the  people's\r\n\r\nlivelihood and will affect other economic  factors.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister can pay attention to this.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, ours is a developing country. The\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects need large funds  which  come\r\n\r\nfrom  taxation  and  the  issue  of  public  loans.\r\n\r\nSometimes  you have to get loans from international\r\n\r\norganisations.  I would like to know  how  much  we\r\n\r\nhave  borrowed from international organisations  or\r\n\r\nfrom which country and how much interest we have to\r\n\r\npay every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nraised  three important points. First,  corruption.\r\n\r\nShe says that although there have been improvements\r\n\r\nsince  we  took  office, there are no  grounds  for\r\n\r\ncomplacency  and we should always  be  vigilant  in\r\n\r\nstamping out corruption. I entirely agree with her.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  afford  to relax the slightest  in  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of a vigilant attitude towards  corrupt\r\n\r\nofficials.   We   have   the   Corrupt    Practices\r\n\r\nInvestigation Bureau which is doing a good  job  of\r\n\r\nwork.  For  instance,  in  my  Ministry  they  have\r\n\r\ninvestigated into alleged corrupt practices in  the\r\n\r\nImport  and Export Office, as a result of which  12\r\n\r\nofficers  have been interdicted and they are  going\r\n\r\nto  be  charged in court. We cannot be too vigilant\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsearching for more offences and weeding out corrupt\r\n\r\nofficials.  The  final responsibility,  of  course,\r\n\r\nrests  with  the public. If they know that  corrupt\r\n\r\npractices  are  going on, they should  report  them\r\n\r\nforthwith to the C. P. I. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's second point was about the\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  attitude in the  civil  service.  She\r\n\r\nsaid   that   after  1959  we  effected   a   great\r\n\r\nimprovement  and  that  lately  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ngradual  reversion. Public officers are more  prone\r\n\r\nto  be  rude not only to members of the public  but\r\n\r\nalso to M.P.s. I do not know what the truth is, but\r\n\r\nI will not be surprised at all if there is a lot in\r\n\r\nwhat  she  says.  All  I  can  say  is  that  every\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  every Parliamentary  Secretary  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter,  should  look  out  for  examples  of\r\n\r\ndiscourteous  conduct  by  civil  servants  towards\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public. And when they come  across\r\n\r\nsuch  instances,  the persons concerned  should  be\r\n\r\nsubject to disciplinary action. I cannot agree with\r\n\r\nher  more that we must not allow any relaxation  of\r\n\r\nthe high standards of courtesy we expect from civil\r\n\r\nservants and employees of statutory authorities. As\r\n\r\nfor  rudeness to M.P.s, I shall be grateful if  any\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament, who has been so treated  by\r\n\r\ncivil  servants,  will report immediately  such  an\r\n\r\noccasion  either to the Minister of the  Department\r\n\r\nor  to  me  and I will undertake to make  immediate\r\n\r\ninvestigations into the incident.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards waste of public funds, it is no use\r\n\r\npretending that public property or public funds are\r\n\r\nnot  being wasted. I will give you an example.  The\r\n\r\nT.V, cameraman dogs Ministers on public  occasions\r\n\r\nand eventually we get about six seconds on T.V.  To\r\n\r\ntake  these six seconds, I suspect they shoot about\r\n\r\nfive minutes of film, thereby wasting not only film - that  is  not  so  important  - wasting  not   only\r\n\r\ndeveloping solutions to develop this film,  wasting\r\n\r\nnot  only the contact prints that have to be  made,\r\n\r\nbut also the time of the editor and the splicer.  I\r\n\r\nhope something can be done in this respect. This is\r\n\r\njust one occasion ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon.

On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  we have about $1,200 million invested abroad\r\n\r\nor, in other words, lent to other countries.

In that year, some  66  acres  of\r\n\r\nland  in Kampong Glam were allowed for the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  heirs  of  Sultan Hussain and his descendants.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan occupied the land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil  he  died in 1835 and this property had  been\r\n\r\npassed on from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1897, the Courts of Singapore ruled\r\n\r\nthat  the  land belonged to the Colony of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  not to the Sultan's descendants but that  they\r\n\r\nwere  allowed  to  make  use  of  it.  So  in   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the properties under  the  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain's  Ordinance,  provision  is  made  for  an\r\n\r\nannual  payment  to  be  made  to  the  family  and\r\n\r\ndescendants of the late Sultan, and throughout  the\r\n\r\nyears  the  net revenue has been paid  out  to  the\r\n\r\ndescendants  and  this amounted  to  $63,379.99  in\r\n\r\n1964.

In  view of the present boom experienced  by\r\n\r\nthe  hotel  industry, will it not be beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe  Tourist  Promotion  Board  if  this  cess   is\r\n\r\nextended to cover more hotels?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, I do not think it is\r\n\r\nequitable to require some hotels, who are really no\r\n\r\nbetter  than  lodging-houses,  to  pay  this   tax,\r\n\r\nbecause  under  no conceivable circumstances  would\r\n\r\ninternational  tourists be  patronising  them.  The\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion Board makes up a list of tourist\r\n\r\nhotels  and these are the hotels that benefit  most\r\n\r\ndirectly  from  the  promotion  activities  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.

Let  me  give an example to  the  House  how\r\n\r\ninequitable sometimes the rigid application of  the\r\n\r\nlaw can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say a family has only a house which is\r\n\r\nassessed by the Property Tax Division as a property\r\n\r\ncapable of fetching $300 income a year, which means\r\n\r\n$25  a  month.  This is the rent that the  property\r\n\r\nwould fetch at market rates. Then the Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision  proceeds to levy a tax on  the  property,\r\n\r\ni.e., 18 or 23 per cent or whatever the rate is  on\r\n\r\nthis  annual value of $300. If, say, it is  18  per\r\n\r\ncent,  the  head of the family would  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nsomething  like $48 a month. But the  rent  is  the\r\n\r\nsole income of the property owner. However, if, for\r\n\r\nexample,  he  has  a sum of money and,  instead  of\r\n\r\ninvesting it in a piece of property, he puts it  in\r\n\r\na  bank  and earns interest. Let us say he gets  an\r\n\r\nequivalent of $300 interest a year. Now, if that is\r\n\r\nhis  sole income, he would be free from payment  of\r\n\r\nincome tax, because his income is $300 a year only.\r\n\r\nAnd since he has no other income than this $300  he\r\n\r\nneed not have to pay income tax. But if he were  to\r\n\r\nbe  so  foolish  as  to put his investment  into  a\r\n\r\nhouse,  as mentioned earlier, he would have to  pay\r\n\r\nthe Government $48 a year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, as far as the law of property tax\r\n\r\ngoes, the Property Tax Division is quite correct in\r\n\r\nassessing this case. But I think they are  applying\r\n\r\nthe  law  far  too rigidly. If I am  not  mistaken,\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision in the Property Tax  Ordinance\r\n\r\nfor relief, but this provision is never made use of\r\n\r\nand  never  applied. I wonder whether the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  assure the House that in deserving  cases  for\r\n\r\nrelief, he will ask the Comptroller of Property Tax\r\n\r\nto invoke this provision liberally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this\r\n\r\namendment  has  been  moved by  my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChu  Kang, I have also to move my amendment*  on the\r\n\r\nsame  subhead,  but  the  difference  is  that   my\r\n\r\namendment  is  to reduce the subhead by  the  whole\r\n\r\nsum.  I  should,  however, like  to  speak  on  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Member for Choa Chu Kang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment (2) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 1101.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am fully of the same view as that\r\n\r\nexpressed by him. But I have something more to add,\r\n\r\nand  I hope that the Minister for Finance will look\r\n\r\ninto  such matters. First of all, Sir, I  refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  application  for  transfer  of  ownership   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of those who own houses. This concerns  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  very  much.  I  have  had   on   many\r\n\r\noccasions received complaints from my constituents,\r\n\r\nespecially those involved in applying for  transfer\r\n\r\nof ownership.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may trouble the House with a little bit of\r\n\r\ndetail,  Sir. Let us say, for example, that  Mr  A\r\n\r\nbought  a  house from Mr B some 15 years ago,  and\r\n\r\nthat house has been given a number. Today with  the\r\n\r\nsocial  amenities  available to him,  for  example,\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water supplies, Mr  A  wishes  to\r\n\r\napply for such services. But unfortunately, Sir, on\r\n\r\nthe  property  tax bill, the name of the  owner  is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  In  other words, the  previous  owner's\r\n\r\nname is given on the bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr A has to make an application to have his name registered in the owner's list. Unfortunately, too, Mr B, who sold the house to Mr A, could not be traced. There arises the complication. Poor Mr A would probably have to make a statutory declaration to the effect that to the best of his knowledge and\r\n\r\nso  on  and so forth, he is the sole owner  of  the\r\n\r\nhouse. And I take it that the Property Tax Division\r\n\r\nwould  come to his assistance. The rural folks  now\r\n\r\nrealise that with such amenities available at their\r\n\r\ndoorstep,  they  can have them,  and  in  order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  such matters the Property Tax  Division\r\n\r\nshould come to their assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is this, and\r\n\r\nthat is in regard to renumbering of houses. I think\r\n\r\nthis  issue is not new, it has been brought  up  in\r\n\r\nprevious Budget sessions, and today I have to bring\r\n\r\nit  up again for the simple reason that some houses\r\n\r\nin certain areas have been renumbered and some have\r\n\r\nnot. The main reason I was given to understand  was\r\n\r\nthat the owner's name, as listed in the register of\r\n\r\nowners, was different from that of the present, and\r\n\r\nhence  a  number could not be given. Of course,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case the Minister could get a better look  at\r\n\r\nit  and  say, \"Will the Member submit me a list  of\r\n\r\nnames  and  so forth, and I will look up?\"  I  say,\r\n\r\nSir, that such cases do exist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that I come to my third point, and that is\r\n\r\nthe  application for a house number.  This  subject\r\n\r\nagain  is not new, and I am sorry I have to trouble\r\n\r\nthe House again with a little bit of detail just to\r\n\r\nsee  how a house number applied for would be given.\r\n\r\nIt  goes like this. First, you have an unauthorised\r\n\r\nhut  or dwelling house, to put it whatever way  you\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Demolish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang is\r\n\r\nof the opinion that it should be demolished, but  I\r\n\r\nwould say that if the Minister says, \"Go ahead with\r\n\r\nthe  demolition of all the unauthorised  structures\r\n\r\nin  Choa Chu Kang,\" I think the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  will be the first to stand up and say,  \"Sir,\r\n\r\nthese are the reasons, and on compassionate grounds\r\n\r\nthey should not be demolished, etc., etc.\". I think\r\n\r\nhe  was  probably not attentive during the previous\r\n\r\nyears' Budget debates if he was here.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is this: you have an unauthorised\r\n\r\ndwelling house in existence for umpteen years  - 10, 15, 20 years - and there is no house number. And  as\r\n\r\nI   have  mentioned  just  now,  with  such  social\r\n\r\namenities available at the doorstep, the  owner  of\r\n\r\nthis  unauthorised dwelling house comes  along  and\r\n\r\nsays, \"Can I apply for a house number?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut   before  he  does  so,  he  has  to  make   an\r\n\r\napplication for the retention of an existing house,\r\n\r\nfor  which a form is supplied by the Chief Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor. No doubt it does not concern the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance, but somehow it will and I will dwell on\r\n\r\nit  later.  This applicant fills up  the  form  and\r\n\r\nsends   it   to   the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment,  which  is  the processing  department,\r\n\r\nbecause  after  investigation by their  officers  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  permit  will be issued.  This  temporary\r\n\r\npermit  costs  $12  per  year  and  is  subject  to\r\n\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to that, Sir, up to 1965, as far as I can\r\n\r\nremember,  the temporary permit was only  $2.  With\r\n\r\neffect  from last year it was increased to  $12  - a\r\n\r\n600  per  cent  increase - for one year  to  have  a\r\n\r\ntemporary permit. Be that as it may, Sir, to obtain\r\n\r\na  temporary  permit sometimes takes  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nmonths.  That  may  be the earliest,  if  not  much\r\n\r\nlater.  The  next  process would  be  done  at  the\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax  Division, which is  a  unit  in  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Inland Revenue.  The  Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision  would send its own officers to  the  site\r\n\r\nand investigate again and find out which number  to\r\n\r\ngive.  Here  is where it is my unfortunate  lot  to\r\n\r\nhave  to  bring  to  the attention  of  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Property Tax the fact  that  there\r\n\r\nhas been undue delay of months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Years, my hon, colleague has\r\n\r\njust  mentioned. But I would say  years  is  a  bit\r\n\r\nexaggerated, Sir. I would say it would take  months\r\n\r\nand  probably up to a year. My unfortunate part was\r\n\r\nhaving  to  write  to  the Deputy  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax. I have on record in my own  file  of\r\n\r\n\"Meet the people sessions\" copies of such memoranda\r\n\r\nsent to him and in most cases there was no reply. I\r\n\r\nam just wondering what this Division is doing. Just\r\n\r\nto  get a house number! A chap who could not get it\r\n\r\nwould come to me and ask, \"Please, Mr Ng, can  you\r\n\r\nhelp?\" All right, there goes a copy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  my note.

My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang,  has\r\n\r\nmentioned the annual value of property in the rural\r\n\r\nareas. Bear in mind that most of the houses in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, whether they are in Changi, Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang, Tampines or Punggol ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Or Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Or Sembawang, as the case may\r\n\r\nbe,   are   known  as  temporary  structures   with\r\n\r\ntemporary  permits.

As far as I can remember, the  property\r\n\r\ntax  bills  in respect of temporary huts were  made\r\n\r\nout for at $1.92. I can show the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch bills. Then there was an increase to $6. I  do\r\n\r\nnot think there was a reduction, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There was a reduction, maybe\r\n\r\nbefore  the Member was elected. I cannot be  wrong.\r\n\r\nIt  happened  in  this House.  This  $1.92  is  not\r\n\r\nproperty  tax.  It is quit rent or  something  like\r\n\r\nthat. We are renting out land in the rural areas at\r\n\r\nridiculously low prices. Our rural folks are really\r\n\r\nspoilt.  If  they  were  farmers,  say,  in   other\r\n\r\ncountries,  the landlord would take  over  half  of\r\n\r\ntheir  produce  to start with, and  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould take half of the balance. This goes on in all\r\n\r\nagricultural countries. And here, what do we charge\r\n\r\nthem  - $1.92 a year - not a month - quit  rent.  Then\r\n\r\nthe  owner occupiers pay $6 instead of $48. We  are\r\n\r\ngiving them a present of $42 a year. Far from being\r\n\r\ngrateful, they ask, why are we charging so much for\r\n\r\nthose who are renting out their houses? If they are\r\n\r\npoor  farmers - men who are that poor - how can  they\r\n\r\nbuild  a  house to let out? They become  landlords.\r\n\r\nThey are not poor farmers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Perhaps the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance might have misunderstood the position here.\r\n\r\nQuit  rent  is  very different from  annual  value.\r\n\r\nMoreover, annual value is assessed irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the  owner  occupies  the  house  or  not,\r\n\r\nalthough, of course, there is a difference  in  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  assessment. If it is owner-occupied,  the\r\n\r\nrate is slightly lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the rate is considerably\r\n\r\nlower.  How  can you say $6 is slightly lower  than\r\n\r\n$48?  It is considerably lower. Owner occupiers  of\r\n\r\nattap  dwellings pay $6 property tax a year.  There\r\n\r\nare    12,000   owner   occupiers   enjoying   this\r\n\r\nconcession.  So  I  think Members representing  the\r\n\r\nrural constituencies might have a kind word for the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry when discussing property tax. Now,\r\n\r\nof course, the point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  why 18 per cent if they rent out the dwellings?\r\n\r\nWhy  not 18 per cent? They are landlords; they  are\r\n\r\nnot   farmers.  They  are  all  renting  out  their\r\n\r\nproperty.  If they have built a stone  or  concrete\r\n\r\nbuilding, they pay 18 per cent. So if they build  a\r\n\r\nwooden  structure with attap roof, why should  they\r\n\r\nbe exempted from property tax?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has brought up a number of\r\n\r\npoints    about   transfers   of   ownership    and\r\n\r\napplications for house numbers. I must say that his\r\n\r\nknowledge  of this business is quite encyclopaedic,\r\n\r\nand  I cannot claim to rival his knowledge of  this\r\n\r\nsubject. I am not, of course, being subject  to  so\r\n\r\nmany  applications  at \"Meet the people  sessions\".\r\n\r\nThis  is a vexatious problem. I do not pretend that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  a vexatious problem. These people  are\r\n\r\noften not well educated and not educated in the law\r\n\r\nand  administrative processes. This  is  a  subject\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think  really does not  fall  within  the\r\n\r\nprovince  of the Property Tax Department. This  is,\r\n\r\nif   I  am  right,  something  which  concerns  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Deeds. Or is it the Land Office?  When\r\n\r\nit  comes  to  matters  of ownership  of  property,\r\n\r\nnaturally the Property Tax Division must be careful\r\n\r\nabout   recognising  who  is  the  owner   of   any\r\n\r\nparticular  property. In the instance mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Punggol, the  original  owner  is\r\n\r\nmissing.  Surely this is a proper  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nProperty Tax Division has to be most careful  about\r\n\r\nwho  is the real owner. Otherwise more owners might\r\n\r\nbe  missing! In spite of all that, the  Member  has\r\n\r\ntalked   about  delays  in  getting   numbers.   My\r\n\r\ninformation  is  that  the number  of  applications\r\n\r\nreceived  for  house  numbers and  which  is  still\r\n\r\noutstanding as of this moment is 347. So it  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  all that large, considering the number of attap\r\n\r\nhuts in the rural areas. It may be 30,000 or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the reduction of annual values, there\r\n\r\nare  set  procedures  laid  down.  No  doubt  these\r\n\r\nprocedures entail a lot of difficulties and trouble\r\n\r\nwhich are beyond the rural folk to comprehend.  But\r\n\r\nhere again I must remind hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  that the annual values attached  to  these\r\n\r\nproperties are very low. $300 a year would  be  an\r\n\r\nexceptionally high figure. Most of them  would  be\r\n\r\nin  the region of $150 to $180 a year. So it cannot\r\n\r\nreally be said that this involves great hardship on\r\n\r\nthe  rural  folks. On the question  of  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould simplify our procedures, I think the opinion\r\n\r\nof Members from the rural constituencies is that we\r\n\r\nshould simplify them. I am willing to listen to any\r\n\r\nreasonable  suggestion for simplifying  procedures.\r\n\r\nif  hon.  Members have any good proposals,  I  will\r\n\r\ngive them the fullest consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I said that the\r\n\r\nbill was a property tax bill and it was $1.92 which\r\n\r\nwas collected until about 1960. From 1961, below $2\r\n\r\nno  collections were made. This is the point I want\r\n\r\nto  bring home. And I can supply the Minister  such\r\n\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the transfer of\r\n\r\nownership.  As  I  understand it, the  question  of\r\n\r\nownership does not relate very much to the Registry\r\n\r\nof Titles and Deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, let me explain.

We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwish to resort to peaceful means to achieve social\r\n\r\nreconstruction. In other words, we want  to  adopt\r\n\r\npeaceful  ways and means by which we could  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  gap  between the rich and the poor.  However,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I regret to say  that  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  there is a small number of public servants\r\n\r\nwho  do  not seem to understand the principles  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism. They still have the attitude\r\n\r\nof  the  colonial  days. I want  to  quote  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples to substantiate what I have said. We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  a  high  percentage of  our  country's\r\n\r\nrevenue is from property tax. Of course, the  more\r\n\r\nproperty  tax we collect, the more is our  revenue\r\n\r\nand  this is a very good thing. However,  I  think\r\n\r\nassessment on properties should be based  on  the\r\n\r\nbackground  of the owners. Some assessors  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to  understand the conditions under  which\r\n\r\nthe  rural dwellers live. Hence, their assessment\r\n\r\non  properties  is  excessively high.  In  certain\r\n\r\nareas, because of land acquisition for military or\r\n\r\ndevelopment   purposes,  the  people   have   been\r\n\r\nresettled elsewhere. Of course, the Government  is\r\n\r\njustified in acquiring these lands in the national\r\n\r\ninterests.  Before  they  were  resettled,   these\r\n\r\npeople had been occupying certain pieces of land.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  the  land area was many  times  larger\r\n\r\nthaii  the land given to them on resettlement.  On\r\n\r\nthese  larger  areas  of  land  they  could  plant\r\n\r\nvegetables  and fruit trees and make a living  out\r\n\r\nof  them  more  easily.  Generally  speaking,  the\r\n\r\nincome  of  the people who have been resettled  is\r\n\r\nless than their income before their resettlement.\r\n\r\nSometimes  when they are resettled in a  low-lying\r\n\r\narea,  these  people will have  to  spend  several\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars to try to drain off the  area\r\n\r\nin  order  to build their homes and make a  living\r\n\r\nout  of  the land. As such, the livelihood of  the\r\n\r\nrural  people  is more difficult than  before  the\r\n\r\nresettlement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, before the people were\r\n\r\nresettled,  most  of  them were  living  in  attap\r\n\r\nhouses.  They were enjoying a certain  concession\r\n\r\non property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax by paying only a few dollars per year. If they\r\n\r\nwere staying in attap houses, the property tax was\r\n\r\nonly $6. When they moved out, they could not carry\r\n\r\nthe  attap houses with them. So they have to build\r\n\r\nnew houses to stay\r\n\r\nin.   Some  assessors, who do not quite understand\r\n\r\nthe conditions of these people, value these newly-built  houses  at many times more  than  what  was\r\n\r\nassessed before, and sometimes as much as 700  per\r\n\r\ncent  more. On the one hand, the income  of  these\r\n\r\nrural people who have been resettled has dwindled.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, their assessments  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased. This is the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about pigsties and chicken\r\n\r\npens. Most of the rural people keep fowl, pigs and\r\n\r\nother  domestic animals. They spend a lot of time,\r\n\r\nenergy and a great deal of labour in rearing their\r\n\r\ndomestic  animals. But very often there are  cases\r\n\r\nof  losses  and  these figures  are  unknown.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  not  very long ago there  were  certain\r\n\r\ncases  of swine fever and other animal epidemics,\r\n\r\ncausing great losses to some of the farmers.  Even\r\n\r\nif  they  can  make  some  money  out  of  rearing\r\n\r\ndomestic  animals, it is only meant to eke  out  a\r\n\r\nliving. From what I know, every pigsty keeper  has\r\n\r\nto  pay  the Government licence fee of $12  for  a\r\n\r\npigsty.  These pigsties and chicken  sheds  cannot\r\n\r\navoid  the  assessors' valuation,  and  for  these\r\n\r\nthings,  their  owners will have to  pay  property\r\n\r\ntax. So the owners have to pay double taxation.  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  found anything in the law  saying  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be a property tax on  pigsties  and\r\n\r\nchicken   sheds.  I  think  this   is   merely   a\r\n\r\nrequirement  by the assessors. Here I  would  most\r\n\r\nearnestly appeal to the Hon. Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nto  consider  my  appeal. There  are  two  points.\r\n\r\nFirst,   to  reduce  the  property  tax   in   the\r\n\r\nresettlement  areas. Secondly, to exempt  chicken\r\n\r\nsheds  and  pigsties  from property  tax.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Finance  can   agree   to   these\r\n\r\nsuggestions, I know the rural people will be  very\r\n\r\ngrateful to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  agree   with   the\r\n\r\nsentiments  expressed by the Member who  has  just\r\n\r\nspoken.  We  all  know that the rural  people  are\r\n\r\ngenerally   very  poor.  Their   only   means   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  their livelihood depends  on  rearing\r\n\r\npigs,  chickens and other domestic animals.  Their\r\n\r\nincome  is  merely to maintain their  families  at\r\n\r\nsubsistence  level.  If the property  tax  is  too\r\n\r\nhigh,  they  might meet with certain  difficulties\r\n\r\nand   might   not   be  able  to  maintain   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood. There are certain difficulties  facing\r\n\r\nthe  people  of my constituency. Every  year  some\r\n\r\npeople  have  to  pay $100 to  $200  per  year  in\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  on chicken sheds and pigsties.  The\r\n\r\npigs  and chickens do not know how to pay property\r\n\r\ntax.   So  the  owners  have  to  pay  for   their\r\n\r\naccommodation.  We  have  to  consider  this.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has said that taxes have been reduced for\r\n\r\n10  years  in succession. Agriculture  and  animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry have also declined. If that is  a  fact,\r\n\r\nwe should improve the lot of the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Members appeal for a\r\n\r\nreduction  in property tax in respect of  pigsties\r\n\r\nand chicken pens. For their elucidation, there  is\r\n\r\nno  property  tax on pigsties and  chicken  pens,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  entirely  agree with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang that pigs and poultry cannot pay tax. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  tax them. What happens is that the Health\r\n\r\nDepartment  levies a fee of $6  a  year  on  every\r\n\r\npigsty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There is no collection of any  sort  for\r\n\r\npoultry pens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for farmers being worse off, farmers in every\r\n\r\ncountry  say  this  thing.

So I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  thought that the reduction in the number  of\r\n\r\nfarmers  is  really to the advantage of  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what he has said about hardship in\r\n\r\nresettlement cases should be taken seriously.

But the taxing of  a  worker's\r\n\r\ngratuity or ex-gratia payment, when it is given to\r\n\r\nhim, say, on premature retrenchment or under  any\r\n\r\ncircumstances, can hardly be considered  just  and\r\n\r\nequitable. The argument may be put forward that if\r\n\r\nthis  gratuity  is deposited with the  C.P.F.,  it\r\n\r\nwill  not be taxed. I do not think this is a  good\r\n\r\nsolution  to the worker who does not have  a  job.\r\n\r\nWhat is he to live on until he reaches the age  of\r\n\r\n55?  If  he  does not get a job to enable  him  to\r\n\r\nsupport his family,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  do  not expect him to live on thin  air.  The\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities for men in the age  group\r\n\r\nof   45   to  55  are  very  slim,  and  this   is\r\n\r\nparticularly so when they reach the age of 50.  Do\r\n\r\nthe  authorities consider that they can afford  to\r\n\r\nbe  taxed?  I  urge the Minister to  consider  the\r\n\r\nexemption   of  tax  on  gratuities  or  ex-gratia\r\n\r\npayments  made  to retrenched workers.  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  if  tax  has  to be paid, a certain  formula\r\n\r\nshould  be  worked out whereby the total  gratuity\r\n\r\nshould be divided by the number of years from  the\r\n\r\nlime that a worker is retrenched up to the age  of\r\n\r\n55,  and  that  this sum should  be  allocated  as\r\n\r\nearnings  for each year up to the age  of  55  and\r\n\r\ntaxed  in  the  normal way if  he  is  within  the\r\n\r\ntaxation bracket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only have one\r\n\r\nquestion to ask as a result of what the Member for\r\n\r\nBras Basah has said.

The answer is  that\r\n\r\nspecial  provision  will be made  to  exempt  such\r\n\r\npayments  from income tax. This is a matter  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  Minister  for  Labour  who  is  now\r\n\r\nworking  out a comprehensive scheme to help  these\r\n\r\npeople through their period of difficulty.

Certain   shops   have   lodged\r\n\r\ncomplaints.   For  example,  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nintioduced  quotas and import duties  because  of\r\n\r\nour  industrialisation drive in order  to  protect\r\n\r\nlocal   industries  for  domestic   markets.   The\r\n\r\nquestion   arises  whether  local   products   are\r\n\r\nsufficient to meet local demand. Many small  shops\r\n\r\ndealing in textiles have experienced a shortage of\r\n\r\nsuch goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, they are not able to import\r\n\r\nforeign  textiles  to meet the  demands  of  their\r\n\r\nconsumers  because  of  the  quota  system,  which\r\n\r\ntherefore  results  in complaints  lodged  by  the\r\n\r\nshops.  On  the other hand, this also affects  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  and increases their burden because  the\r\n\r\nlocal  products  are  insufficient  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of local consumers and therefore  results\r\n\r\nin  an  increase  in prices, thus  leading  to  an\r\n\r\nincreased  burden for the lower and middle  income\r\n\r\ngroups. Apart from textile goods, there are  other\r\n\r\nlocal  products  which are manufactured  locally.\r\n\r\nThey too have the same problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that at the moment there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  general increase in the prices of  goods,\r\n\r\nespecially  since  the devaluation  of  the  Pound\r\n\r\nSterling.  At  that time, for the  convenience  of\r\n\r\nexchange, merchants raised the prices of  certain\r\n\r\ngoods.  For  example, ground nuts or peanuts  were\r\n\r\nsold  at 80 cents per katty formerly, but in order\r\n\r\nto  facilitate the coin exchange, they have raised\r\n\r\nthe  price  to  $1 per katty. Another  example  is\r\n\r\nmilk.  Formerly it was sold at 65 cents  per  tin,\r\n\r\nbut it has since been raised to 70 or 75 cents per\r\n\r\ntin.  These  are  all daily necessities,  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the prices of these necessities  has\r\n\r\nled  to  an increased burden. In actual fact,  our\r\n\r\nSingapore currency has not been devalued and, with\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of  the  new  coins,  merchants\r\n\r\nshould  reduce their prices in order not to  cause\r\n\r\nhardship to the general public. But up to date we\r\n\r\nhave  not seen any reduction, and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  has  not  taken any  steps  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nincrease in prices or to bring the prices down  to\r\n\r\ntheir  original  level.  The  general  public  are\r\n\r\nsuffering and this will increase their burden.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, their salaries are not increased.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I request the Minister for Finance  to\r\n\r\ntake  suitable measures to deal with  the  general\r\n\r\nincrease in prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The general position about\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of  consumer goods  produced  by  our\r\n\r\nindustries is that the supply is ample and quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadequate  to  meet  domestic  demand.

The  market was greatly upset  about  a\r\n\r\nweek   or  two  because  of  this  wretched   coin\r\n\r\nbusiness.  This has sorted itself out. As  I  have\r\n\r\noften  informed Members, some prices do go up  and\r\n\r\nother prices do come down. And by selecting prices\r\n\r\nwhich  go  up or prices which come down,  you  can\r\n\r\nprove any point you want. But as I have said, I do\r\n\r\nnot  get  the impression that there is an abnormal\r\n\r\nincrease  in prices. Rather, at about  this  time,\r\n\r\nthe  festive  season, there  is  nothing  much  to\r\n\r\njustify  increased prices.

We\r\n\r\nare  all  aware that the Central Provident  Fund,\r\n\r\never  since its establishment in 1955, has been  a\r\n\r\nvery  good source of provision of capital  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  for  economic  and   other\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Since  1955  amendments  have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced from time to time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  improve the collection of contributions from\r\n\r\nmembers and employers, which is a good thing. But\r\n\r\nother  than  amendments  for  tightening  up  the\r\n\r\nevasion  or avoidance of collections, I think  no\r\n\r\nother  provision  has been made  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsocial benefits for its contributors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime in November I asked the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would look into the  feasibility  of\r\n\r\nsetting up a committee to examine the possibility\r\n\r\nof  allowing members of the C.P.F. to  use  their\r\n\r\ncontributions as down-payments for purchase  of\r\n\r\nhouses  in order to promote home ownership  among\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  group and, if  necessary,  to\r\n\r\nrecommend   such   amendments   to   the   C.P.F.\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The answer I got was that 74 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the contributors have less than $1,000 in the\r\n\r\nFund.  This  means  that  26  per  cent  of   the\r\n\r\ncontributors have $1,000 or more in the Fund. Is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  not aware that this 26  per  cent,\r\n\r\nthough it may be in the minority now, will  be  a\r\n\r\nbig  minority  as  the  years  go  by,  and  will\r\n\r\noutnumber the 74 per cent? Is it not time now  to\r\n\r\nsit  down and consider what improvements can  be\r\n\r\nworked out for the benefit of its contributors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the C.P.F. is a good source of\r\n\r\ncapital accumulation for the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nin  his economic projects, but surely I think the\r\n\r\ncontributors   themselves  should   have   first\r\n\r\npriority  for their own benefit or for their  own\r\n\r\nfamily benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I agree with all  the  reasons\r\n\r\ngiven by the Member for River Valley. But I think\r\n\r\nthat  since  he has been so enthusiastic  in  his\r\n\r\nproposals,   perhaps   this   matter   has   some\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  his  position,  because   he\r\n\r\nappears  to be a member of the middle class.  His\r\n\r\nproposal  is  to help more people in  the  middle\r\n\r\nclass to own houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the aims of the C.P.F, is to enable an\r\n\r\nemployee,  whether in the Government  or  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have  certain funds to live on after  he  has\r\n\r\nretired.  But  we  know that if a  worker  should\r\n\r\nbegin  working at the age of 20 years and  retire\r\n\r\nat  55,  it would be quite a long time before  he\r\n\r\ncould make use of his provident fund. To him,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  quite economical, and although a certain\r\n\r\nrate  of  interest is paid by the C.P.F.,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  low.  So the suggestion by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley  that  Government  should  consider\r\n\r\nallowing  members of the C.P.F. to  make  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  fund  as  a deposit to buy houses,  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  a very useful and good suggestion.  Since\r\n\r\nour  Government  is  one that  looks  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people, we should always  listen\r\n\r\nto  the  views given by the people.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can give serious consideration  to  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Member for River Valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can accept suggestions from the people, we\r\n\r\ncan  help them to raise their standard of living,\r\n\r\nbecause  with  their  own  housing  accommodation\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood will be better. I believe if we\r\n\r\ncan  do that, many people will thank our Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, since we are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the Central Provident Fund,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to raise one particular point. I wonder  if\r\n\r\nsome alleviation could be brought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, as the law stands, a person can only\r\n\r\nwithdraw his fund when he reaches the age  of  55\r\n\r\nor,  if he wants ti withdraw the fund before  the\r\n\r\nage  of 55, he should be unemployed for not  less\r\n\r\nthan two years and he should not be likely to  be\r\n\r\nemployed  further.  In  my constituency,  I  have\r\n\r\nperiodically come across people in the age  group\r\n\r\nof  40  to  45 who have been retrenched  and  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  find jobs. They have been  unemployed\r\n\r\nfor  two  years -some less than two  years;  some\r\n\r\nmore  than two years. By definition, as  the  law\r\n\r\nstands, these people cannot withdraw their funds\r\n\r\nuntil  they have reached the age of at least  53. It  is not very likely that these people would be\r\n\r\nable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   get   jobs   because  of  the   unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation.  Nobody is prepared  to  give  jobs  to\r\n\r\npeople  of  this particular age group.  They  want\r\n\r\nyounger  people as far as possible. Is it possible\r\n\r\nto  look into this question and provide a means of\r\n\r\namelioration so far as this category of people  is\r\n\r\nconcerned'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, ever since the setting up of the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund in 1955, not a single year\r\n\r\nhas  gone by without someone asking for his  money\r\n\r\nto be released for some reason or other. This year\r\n\r\nwe  have three. The answer to this is very simple.\r\n\r\nHuman nature is such that so long as the money  is\r\n\r\nthere, the temptation or the urge to spend  it  is\r\n\r\nalways  there.  We, as trustees  of  the  people's\r\n\r\nmoney, will be failing in our duty if we do not do\r\n\r\nour best to resist this demand t get the money out\r\n\r\nand  spend it. Thriftiness and the habit of saving\r\n\r\nare  things which we must try to teach our  people\r\n\r\nto accept. The Housing Board's introduction of the\r\n\r\nhouse  ownership scheme has let loose a series  of\r\n\r\nfresh demands to draw the money out, and this time\r\n\r\non  the grounds that they use tht; money as  down-payments  to purchase Housing Board flats.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  they  have  got  this  all  wrong.   House\r\n\r\nownership  is  something we are  encouraging  the\r\n\r\npeople  to achieve. But they must achieve this  by\r\n\r\nsome  other worth while means and not by utilising\r\n\r\nthe  money which they have set aside for  old  age\r\n\r\nsecurity. If they really want to have a house or a\r\n\r\nflat  of their own, they should try to do this  by\r\n\r\nworking  haider,  by putting in  extra  effort  in\r\n\r\nproductivity,  earn more and put in extra  efforts\r\n\r\nto  save that extra money to achieve the object of\r\n\r\nhouse  ownership. This will make their achievement\r\n\r\nmore  precious to them at heart. In this way, they\r\n\r\nwill  not only have a house of their own, but when\r\n\r\nthey  reach  the age of 55 they will also  have  a\r\n\r\nlump sum of money to see them through in their old\r\n\r\nage.  I  am  sure this is more beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  as  well  as to  the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry as a whole. There may be other perfectly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate grounds on which people would  want  to\r\n\r\ndraw  their  money  out of the  Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund, such as unemployment, hardship, sickness, or\r\n\r\na  desire to finance a business venture. But I  am\r\n\r\nafraid once the opening is allowed, the temptation\r\n\r\nto  draw some more money from the C.P.F. is always\r\n\r\nthere  and in next to no time there will  be  no\r\n\r\nmore  money left. So the question is very  simple.\r\n\r\nDo  we  or  do  we not want savings  for  old  age\r\n\r\nsecurity?  If  we  want  to  save  for  old   age\r\n\r\nsecurity, we must not touch the money. If we touch\r\n\r\nthe  money, there will be no old age security.

We  know that as society  progresses,\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  daily necessities  increase.

When a person is sick,\r\n\r\ncan he withdraw a certain amount of money from the\r\n\r\nfund  in  order to look after his illness and  see\r\n\r\nhim  through? Suppose he has no other  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  family who can look after him, and he may not\r\n\r\nhave   reached   the  age  limit,   and   suppose,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, he dies of the sickness, what  will\r\n\r\nhappen to him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Delta has\r\n\r\nasked whether the money paid into the C.P.F. will\r\n\r\nearn  any  interest.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  every  week during  my  \"Meet  the\r\n\r\npeople  sessions\",  about  20  per  cent  of   the\r\n\r\napplicants  come  up  with problems  relating  to\r\n\r\ntheir  citizenship applications. You  can  broadly\r\n\r\ndivide  the  category of people  into  three.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  are those who have been in Singapore for  a\r\n\r\nlong time - 15 or 20 years - and who want to apply\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship.  The second category  are  those\r\n\r\nwhose  parents  have  become  Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nwhose  brothers and sisters who were subsequently\r\n\r\nborn  after  them were born in Singapore  and  are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens. But unfortunately the  eldest\r\n\r\nchild was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot born in Singapore but was born at the hospital\r\n\r\nin  Johore  Bahru. He came to Singapore  within  a\r\n\r\nmonth  of  his birth and he has been in  Singapore\r\n\r\never  since. He is not a Singapore citizen and  he\r\n\r\nhas   applied  for  his  citizenship.  The   third\r\n\r\ncategory  are  those students who want  to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir higher education and apply for what is known\r\n\r\nas  junior  citizenship. In almost  every  one  of\r\n\r\nthese  cases,  they  had been interviewed  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Citizenship  from  between  six   and\r\n\r\neighteen months, and up to date they have not  had\r\n\r\nany  reply, either of rejection or acceptance. Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  let us know whether  some  form  of\r\n\r\nprocedure  can  he  devised  so  that  people  are\r\n\r\ncategorised, and those people  who  ought  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  citizenship or ought to  be  considered  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible are considered first and  some\r\n\r\nkind of decision is made in these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The Member for Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\nhas raised this matter about citizenship. It is  a\r\n\r\nrather   delicate  and  complicated  matter.   The\r\n\r\ngranting  of  citizenship to a person  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  matter. Citizenship in any  country  is\r\n\r\nnot  freely  given. It confers certain rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges on a person. In our case, it gives  him\r\n\r\nthe  right to work, to apply for a house,  to  get\r\n\r\nplaces  for  his children in our schools.  It  ako\r\n\r\nimposes  certain obligations on him to the  State.\r\n\r\nWe  do not want citizens of convenience. There are\r\n\r\npeople   who   want   Singapore  citizenship   for\r\n\r\nobtaining travel documents. They always  rush  to\r\n\r\nthe  office  and  say that they  want  to  have  a\r\n\r\npassport and that they want out citizenship. There\r\n\r\nare  also  others who want citizenship  to  obtain\r\n\r\nsocial  benefits  like housing, education,  public\r\n\r\nassistance and jobs. The Registrar of Citizens has\r\n\r\nto  process every application for citizenship very\r\n\r\ncarefully  to  determine that the applicant  not\r\n\r\nonly    possesses   the   necessary    residential\r\n\r\nqualification,  but  also  that  he  is  of  good\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  is prepared to  be  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\nRepublic, and is not just a citizen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  convenience.  It  takes  time  to  investigate\r\n\r\nthoroughly   each   and  every   application   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Therefore, the delay in many cases is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also rather difficult to categorise, as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  has  suggested,  because  it  is   so\r\n\r\ndifficult  to determine the urgency of each  case.\r\n\r\nSo we would rather that they take their turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I share the same\r\n\r\nsentiments as the Member for Bukit Panjang. In  my\r\n\r\n\"Meet the people sessions\", I have 50 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe people talking about citizenship. In his case,\r\n\r\nhe  has  got only 20 per cent of the people trying\r\n\r\nto apply for citizenship. From all these cases we\r\n\r\nknow that most of the applicants have applied  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  one year, or sometimes more  than  two\r\n\r\nyears,  without  being granted  citizenship.  From\r\n\r\nwhat  I  know,  they  really meet  the  conditions\r\n\r\nstipulated and some members of their families  are\r\n\r\ncitizens. For instance, the applicant's father  is\r\n\r\na citizen whereas the mother may not be a citizen.\r\n\r\nSo   I  hope  the  Minister  can  look  into  this\r\n\r\nsituation and urge the Registry of Citizenship  to\r\n\r\npay  special attention to this matter. Just as the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said, with citizenship a person  can\r\n\r\nhave  a  lot of rights. Will it not give people  a\r\n\r\nwrong  impression because there is  an  increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of citizens? If there are more citizens  in\r\n\r\nthe making, then our Government will have to spend\r\n\r\nmore money with the added burden of having to look\r\n\r\nafter  them.  So  we make use of  this  tactic  of\r\n\r\ndelaying  to  avoid this issue. Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nclarify  whether it is because of this that  there\r\n\r\nis a delay in granting citizenship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the applications\r\n\r\nshould go through a thorough investigation. But  I \r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether, in actual fact,  this\r\n\r\nhas  taken  place, because sonic  applicants  have \r\n\r\nwaited  for  so long and they have not  even  been \r\n\r\ncalled  for interview. How do we know whether  any\r\n\r\nactual  investigations have been carried out?

Minister for Labour. My two colleagues\r\n\r\nhave  brought up almost identical points and  they\r\n\r\nare  centred on the time it takes for a person  to\r\n\r\nacquire   his  citizenship.  We  all   know   that\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is  priceless in that  it  accords  a\r\n\r\nholder all the privileges pertaining to the  State\r\n\r\nhe  lives  in.  I  have just one little  point  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  what  the  other  two  Members  have\r\n\r\nbrought up. I am given to understand that  when  a\r\n\r\nperson,  who  is eligible to apply  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  goes r0 the Registry of  Citizenship\r\n\r\nto make a formal application, all he is given is a\r\n\r\nblank form and he is asked to pay a certain sum as\r\n\r\nstamp  fee  and  told to come back much  later.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that before such a form is handed to\r\n\r\nan applicant, an explanation is given to him as to\r\n\r\nwhat he is expected to do with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also given to understand that there have\r\n\r\nbeen cases where the officers in the Registry have\r\n\r\nbeen  discourteous to the public. Of course,  here\r\n\r\nagain,  Sir,  I anticipate that the Minister  will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Will  the Member for Punggol  name  me  one\r\n\r\ninstance where such an incident happened?\" I think\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  prepared for it because  one  of  my\r\n\r\nC.C.C, members  was involved when  he  brought  a\r\n\r\nfriend  along. It appears to me that  it  was  not\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy  but the attitude of the  officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Registry,  and  I  would  like  this  to   be\r\n\r\nrectified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, will it be possible to minimise any\r\n\r\nundue  delay? I shall be grateful if the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  give  details of the number of  applications\r\n\r\nreceived by the Registry concerned and the  number\r\n\r\napproved in respect of months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, my complaint against the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Citizenship is somewhat different.  1\r\n\r\nthink  there  is or there has been  a  controversy\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Registry  of  Citizenship  and   the\r\n\r\nimmigration Department. A number of applicants for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  certificates apparently are  able  to\r\n\r\nmeet   the  qualifications  laid  down   in   the\r\n\r\nCitizership    Ordinance   such   as   residential\r\n\r\nqualification, language test and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. But the applicant has received a reply from\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Citizeiship to the effect that  he\r\n\r\nhas  got  no  family roots, which means  that  the\r\n\r\napplicant  is  a bachelor and, therefore,  is  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  a  citizenship certificate.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, Sir, I think you are aware that  last\r\n\r\nFriday,  the Minister of Defence, who is  also  in\r\n\r\ncharge  on  immigration, stated that  he  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to allow young women or even women of 83  to\r\n\r\ncome  in.  But  the  applicant for  a  citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificate has his wife in China or in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nApparently under the circumstances, this applicant\r\n\r\nhas to divorce his wife and get himself married to\r\n\r\na   local   girl  here  before  applying   for   a\r\n\r\ncitizenship  certificate because the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  will  certainly refuse  to  allow  his\r\n\r\noriginal wife to come into Singapore. How is  this\r\n\r\nman  going to establish his family roots? This  is\r\n\r\nreally very absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to say a few words. It is really\r\n\r\nvery   difficult   for   people   to   apply   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   I   do  go  to  the   Registry   of\r\n\r\nCitizenship and ask the officials why  so  and  so\r\n\r\nhas  applied for citizenship for so long  and  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is not finalised yet. But the reply  given\r\n\r\nis  that  it is a C.I.D. matter. Because of  this,\r\n\r\nthe  leople hate the C.I.D. The investigations  of\r\n\r\nthe  C.I.D. are entirely wrong and have  adversely\r\n\r\naffected many people. As a result, applicants find\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to get citizenship. So  the  people\r\n\r\nturn  round and hate the P.A.P. Government  for  its\r\n\r\ninefficiency. I suggest that if the C.I.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  incapable  of investigating the character  of\r\n\r\nthe  applicants, then I think it is better to hand\r\n\r\nover  these  duties to the Citizens'  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee concerned so that within one  week  the\r\n\r\ncommittee will be able to finish off this work of\r\n\r\ninvestigation. Some people have been  waiting  for\r\n\r\nfour or five years and yet the reply given is that\r\n\r\nthe  matter  has not been investigated  yet.  This\r\n\r\nbeing the case, why should the C.I.D. earn  their\r\n\r\nliving?  The  people  will only  hate  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I suggest that if the C.I.D. or  the\r\n\r\nimmigration  Department  cannot  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nduties, then they had better hand over the  duties\r\n\r\nto  the  Citizens'  Consultative Conimittee  which\r\n\r\nwill be able to finish off the job in less than  a\r\n\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, those people from the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  who  do not have Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\ncannot come here to get married and cannot  pay  a\r\n\r\nvisit  to  their parents. So the members of  these\r\n\r\nfamilies hate the P.A.P. Government. This state of\r\n\r\naffairs should be rectified. Facilities should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  these  people to make periodic  visits\r\n\r\nhere,  say, two weeks or so. How can you  disallow\r\n\r\nthem  to come here? This would be creating a  very\r\n\r\nbad   effect   and   would   be   strangling   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's own neck. If people want to come here\r\n\r\nand  get  married, you should allow  them  to  get\r\n\r\nmarried.  Why  do  you  delay people's  auspicious\r\n\r\noccasions? What state of affairs is this?

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  those  born  in  Singapore  after  1948\r\n\r\nreceived  cards  showing that  they  were  British\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Possibly there were some who were  born\r\n\r\nduring the Japanese occupation, but their identity\r\n\r\ncards or birth certificates were lost. When these\r\n\r\npeople  went to exchange their old identity  cards\r\n\r\nfor  new  ones, the National Registration  Office\r\n\r\nissued  them  with blue identity cards  indicating\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  non-ciizens who have  lost  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights. So I urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nlook into the cases of those people who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere   born  after  1948.  If  they  can  produce\r\n\r\nevidence  to  prove  that  they  have  not   left\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the last ten to  twenty  years,\r\n\r\nthey should be issued with red identity cards  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  obtain work  permits.  The  blue\r\n\r\nidentity cards were issued only at the beginning\r\n\r\nof last year, it has only been one year since the\r\n\r\nissue  of  the new identity cards. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, those born in the Federation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chow, I do not\r\n\r\nwant to cut you short now. But will you please try\r\n\r\nto listen to Madam Chan's plea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock:</b> Sir, I have only one or two\r\n\r\nsentences to complete my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: A number of citizens who have\r\n\r\ncome  from  the Federation and stayed here  for  a\r\n\r\ncertain  period have been given work permits,  but\r\n\r\nthose who have stayed here for a longer period and\r\n\r\nwho possess blue identity cards have not been able\r\n\r\nto get work permits. If we have already recognised\r\n\r\nthem  as permanent residents of Singapore and have\r\n\r\nissued them with blue identity cards, we must also\r\n\r\nlet them have work permits so that they can make a\r\n\r\nliving in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The only solution for those\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore who hold blue  identity  cards\r\n\r\nbecause they do not have birth certificates is  to\r\n\r\napply  for  citizenship  in  order  to  get   pink\r\n\r\nidentity  cards. I do not see any  other  possible\r\n\r\nsolution  for them, because they must  prove  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  really born in Singapore in  order  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for  citizenship. If such  proof  is  not\r\n\r\navailable, I do not think there is any other\r\n\r\nway  by which we can issue them with pink identity\r\n\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that we cannot relax the\r\n\r\nregulations regarding the issue of work permits at\r\n\r\nthe present moment.

But this is something we\r\n\r\nhave to do to ensure the survival of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe employment opportunities in Singapore are very\r\n\r\nlimited,  and  if we do not confine  them  to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  I  am  afraid Members  will  face  more\r\n\r\ntrouble during the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock:</b> I beg leave to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
