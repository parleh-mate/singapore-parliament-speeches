With your extensive experience as a Member of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  since  1984, and as a Deputy Speaker for 4  1/2  years\r\n\r\nfrom  January 1989 to June 1993 and as a Minister thereafter,\r\n\r\nMembers   have   no  doubt  that  Parliamentary   proceedings\r\n\r\nconducted  in  this  Chamber, with you  in  the  Chair,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  in accordance with the best  traditions  of\r\n\r\nfairness, decorum and propriety.  All of us, Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  pledge to support you and cooperate with you  in  the\r\n\r\ndischarge of your heavy responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the Ministers and the Members, past\r\n\r\nand  present  during his tenure as Speaker, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Tan  Soo  Khoon,\r\n\r\nyour  distinguished  predecessor.  [Applause.]   Mr  Tan  had\r\n\r\nserved as Deputy Speaker for nearly 4 years, from March 1985,\r\n\r\nbefore  he was elected Speaker in the Seventh Parliament,  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1989.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my congratulatory speech at that time, I said that\r\n\r\nMembers had every confidence that Mr Tan would discharge  his\r\n\r\nresponsibilities with great distinction.  He indeed lived  up\r\n\r\nto  our expectations and we were delighted to re-elect him as\r\n\r\nSpeaker for two more terms in the 8th and 9th Parliaments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, on his election as Speaker, Mr Tan had said\r\n\r\nthat  \"he hoped to maintain the high standards and traditions\r\n\r\nset by his predecessor (Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng)..\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI found myself at times trying to unravel myself from some of\r\n\r\nthe  complexities  of the rules of procedure.\"   Mr  Tan  has\r\n\r\namply fulfilled his pledge.  He indeed upheld the dignity  of\r\n\r\nthis House by ensuring that order and decorum were  observed.\r\n\r\nAlthough  not  legally trained, I believe he has  managed  to\r\n\r\n\"unravel  himself from some of the complexities of the  rules\r\n\r\nof procedure\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his charge as Speaker, our parliamentary debates\r\n\r\nand  all other business of Parliament, including those of the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committees and the Committee of Privileges, proceeded\r\n\r\nmost  smoothly, efficiently and effectively.  As  some  would\r\n\r\nput   it,  it  is  \"like  clock-work\".   He  has  guided  the\r\n\r\nproceedings in this Chamber most fairly, always giving  every\r\n\r\nopportunity for Members to speak.  Despite some long rambling\r\n\r\nspeeches made from time to time, Mr Tan was always patient in\r\n\r\nhearing them out.  He was also indulgent on some Members  who\r\n\r\npressed   on  with  repetitive  questions  even  though   the\r\n\r\nquestions were already answered.  He only interrupted when he\r\n\r\nthought that enough was enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key achievements during Mr Tan Soo Khoon's\r\n\r\ntenure  as  Speaker  is the building of this  new  Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse  which was officially opened on 4th October  1999.   He\r\n\r\nchaired  the Parliament Building Committee, formed  in  1993,\r\n\r\nwhich planned and built this New Parliament House.   He  made\r\n\r\nmany study visits to other parliaments and learned from them.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  this  House  has incorporated  many  upgraded\r\n\r\nfeatures  which  will serve Parliamentarians  well  into  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his Speakership, Mr Tan also strengthened\r\n\r\nrelations   with  and  enhanced  our  status   among   ASEAN,\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  and  other  Parliaments,  through  the  various\r\n\r\nparliamentary delegations he led and conferences he attended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring Parliament closer to the people, Mr Tan\r\n\r\ninitiated  the  Parliament Internet  Homepage  in  May  1996.\r\n\r\nInternet-savvy readers, local and overseas, can now know more\r\n\r\nabout  our  Parliament.   In 1998, Mr  Tan  also  set  up  an\r\n\r\nEducation Department to educate Singaporeans about the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParliament.   Thousands of Singaporeans, including  students,\r\n\r\nhave  learned  more  about Parliament as a  result  of  their\r\n\r\neducational visits to this Parliament complex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us here deeply appreciate Mr Tan Soo Khoon's\r\n\r\ndistinguished  service and achievements in  this  House.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Mr Tan once lamented that someone had asked him\r\n\r\nwhy,  as the Speaker, he could not speak.  Now that he is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  in the Chair, there would be no such constraint.   We\r\n\r\ncertainly  look  forward to his active participation  in  the\r\n\r\ndebates of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Parliament now has 84 elected Members and one\r\n\r\nnew  Non-Constituency Member.  Among the 84 elected  Members,\r\n\r\n25  of them are new PAP Members of Parliament.  May I welcome\r\n\r\nall  of  them warmly.  My advice to all the new MPs  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  make the best use of their time in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nspeak their minds freely on issues which are important and of\r\n\r\nconcern to Singapore and our people.  Let conscience be their\r\n\r\nguide  and contribute actively to the debates in this  House.\r\n\r\nWe  certainly  look  forward to their participation  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join the Leader of\r\n\r\nthe  House  in extending to you our congratulations  on  this\r\n\r\noccasion of your election as Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you and I were amongst the then new Members elected\r\n\r\nto  Parliament in the 1984 General Elections.  There are  not\r\n\r\ntoo many of us left.  Soon thereafter, you were inducted into\r\n\r\nCabinet  and, since then, you have played a pivotal  role  in\r\n\r\npolicy  making as well as providing leadership to our nation.\r\n\r\nAs we get to know you better, we have developed a high regard\r\n\r\nfor  your  character and integrity.  Your  contributions  all\r\n\r\nthese  years  as  Minister  have earned  our  respect.   Your\r\n\r\nelection  to this high office today signifies our  confidence\r\n\r\nin  you.  And for those of us who are involved in sports,  we\r\n\r\nare aware that you were a rugby player during your school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.  You have developed a reputation as someone with broad\r\n\r\nshoulders, who is dependable and reliable, someone who  knows\r\n\r\nwhen  to block, when to pass and when to run.  You have  also\r\n\r\ndeveloped  a  strong sense of team work and fair play,  which\r\n\r\nyou  have  retained to this day.  I am sure  you  will  bring\r\n\r\nthese  same  attributes to your new capacity as  Speaker.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  affirm that we will all give  you  our  full\r\n\r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, may I take some time at this\r\n\r\njuncture  to  pay  tribute to your predecessor,  Mr  Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon,  who  had presided over the proceedings in this  House\r\n\r\nfor  the past 13 years.  When I first entered Parliament,  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  had  already earned a reputation for wit and clarity  in\r\n\r\ngiving  speeches, a reputation well earned as we listened  to\r\n\r\nhis  speeches  as  new MPs.  His election  to  the  Chair  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1989 was a loss to the subsequent batches of Members,\r\n\r\nas  they had one less master to learn from.  Nonetheless, for\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who travelled with him on official  visits,  we\r\n\r\ncould  attest that he is a speech maker par excellence.   His\r\n\r\ndiscourse  always puts Singapore in good light  in  front  of\r\n\r\nParliamentarians from all over the world.  It  is  also  well\r\n\r\nknown  that Mr Tan has a great singing voice when he let  his\r\n\r\nhair, or whatever is left of it, down.  In fact, at this very\r\n\r\nmoment, the tune of Blue Suede Shoes is ringing right  in  my\r\n\r\nears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Speaker, Mr Tan had presided over the proceedings\r\n\r\nduring  his  tenure  exceedingly  well.   His  grasp  of  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  is  complete  and  thorough.   Members  who\r\n\r\nstepped  out  of  line  would  invariably  feel  his   wrath.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  his  handling of Mr J B  Jeyaretnam,  the  Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, who adopted a  belligerent\r\n\r\nstance  in this House, earned our great admiration.  When  it\r\n\r\ncame to Members trying to catch his eye, Mr Tan had been most\r\n\r\nfair,  giving  equal opportunity to everyone,  new  and  old.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very important to us Backbenchers as  a  point,  no\r\n\r\nmatter  how substantial, made a second time, would have  lost\r\n\r\nits  impact.  We had all, at one time or another, experienced\r\n\r\nthe  sharp edge of the knife when he applied the \"guillotine\"\r\n\r\nwhen we rambled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  past our allotted time.  However, one could not complain,\r\n\r\nas   Mr  Tan  applied  the  knife  even-handedly,  be  it   a\r\n\r\nBackbencher or an office holder.  All in all, I think I  have\r\n\r\nthe  support of this House when I say, \"Mr Tan, we will  miss\r\n\r\nyou in the Chair.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be amiss for me if I do not touch on Mr Tan's\r\n\r\ncrowning achievement, and it is the construction of this  new\r\n\r\nParliament  Complex.   The Leader of the  House  has  already\r\n\r\ntouched  on this.  New Members should bear in mind when  they\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  convenience and the comfort of this new  complex.\r\n\r\nAs  I  recall,  when  the new Parliament Building  was  first\r\n\r\ncontemplated by the Government, it was indeed a  very  modest\r\n\r\nconcept.  It was Mr Tan who planted the seed that we not only\r\n\r\nshould  have one that embodies the principles of freedom  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy that Singaporeans hold dear but one that is  worthy\r\n\r\nof  the  achievements  of   Singapore  as  a  modern  nation.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we were all pleasantly surprised that this  piece\r\n\r\nof  prime  land  was  allocated to Parliament  for  this  new\r\n\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that we had the best building possible, Mr Tan\r\n\r\nled  several study trips to overseas parliament buildings  to\r\n\r\nlearn  about  their  features as well as their  shortcomings.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  construction of the building, Mr  Tan  was  also\r\n\r\ninstrumental  in  setting  the requirements  upon  which  the\r\n\r\narchitect  would flesh out the design.  He was also  tireless\r\n\r\nin  chairing  the many meetings of the building committee  to\r\n\r\nensure  that future generations of Singaporeans have a  great\r\n\r\nbuilding  that we could be proud of.  Even though it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  built  this  complex,  we  are  nonetheless\r\n\r\nindebted to Mr Tan for the role he played.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take some time to get used to the fact that Mr\r\n\r\nTan  is  no longer in the Chair, Sir.  Looking at the  bright\r\n\r\nside, he is now back on the Backbench and we look forward  to\r\n\r\nhearing from him once again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  extend my congratulations  to  the  two  new\r\n\r\nDeputy Speakers, Mr Chew Heng Ching and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I have served  in  some\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Committees  and  also  a   Member   of   some\r\n\r\ndelegations to overseas visits, in which Mr Tan Soo Khoon was\r\n\r\nthe  leader.   Being  a  non-PAP  Member,  I  have  not  felt\r\n\r\ndiscriminated, and I think this is important as  he  was  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not the least, I did sometimes flout the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  proceedings rules and,  of  course,  I  got  a\r\n\r\npublic  lecture from Mr Tan Soo Khoon.  I think sometimes  he\r\n\r\ngot  pek  chet with me  -  he was irritated  -  but I realise\r\n\r\nthat  he  did not take these things personally unto  himself.\r\n\r\nFor  that,  I wish to congratulate him for being professional\r\n\r\nin his conduct as the Speaker of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nof  all, let me take the opportunity to congratulate  you  on\r\n\r\nyour  appointment  as the seventh Speaker  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament.   I have known you for the past 18  years,  since\r\n\r\n1984,  when  I served as a grassroots leader in  Siglap,  the\r\n\r\nconstituency  where  you first got elected  as  a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  In fact, it is you who inducted me into politics\r\n\r\nand subsequently convinced me to stand for election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known you to be a fair person willing to\r\n\r\nlisten to all views.  Your track\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecord  as  an  MP  and Minister for the  past  18  years  is\r\n\r\ntestimony of your ability and of what you can achieve, and  I\r\n\r\nam  confident that you will once again excel in your new role\r\n\r\nas Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we are seeing a changeover of a very key\r\n\r\nposition  and  that  is of the Speaker of Parliament.   Since\r\n\r\n1989,  for a span of  13 years, our outgoing Speaker, Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo  Khoon, had been at the helm and, today, the hon. Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nis  handing over the baton, or should I say the Mace, to you.\r\n\r\nI  have  known Mr Tan since 1991 when Siglap became  part  of\r\n\r\nBedok GRC.  Having interacted with his grassroots leaders,  I\r\n\r\nhave heard many good things about Mr Tan.  His grassroots and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders hold him in very high regard, and they have\r\n\r\nalways  spoken  of  him  as a very friendly,  people-oriented\r\n\r\nperson.   The residents have also considered him a friend  to\r\n\r\neveryone in the constituency he was elected in.  And since  I\r\n\r\ngot  elected  into Parliament in 1997, I got to know  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\npersonally and know him much better, having the privilege  of\r\n\r\ninteracting  with  him in the House and  outside  the  House,\r\n\r\nespecially   when   we   went  for  a  number   of   overseas\r\n\r\nparliamentary  trips.  Although we, Members  of  this  House,\r\n\r\nseldom  had  the chance to listen to him because the  Speaker\r\n\r\nseldom has the chance to speak,  the few times when he spoke,\r\n\r\nhe did so with very clear and thought-provoking words and, at\r\n\r\nappropriate times, adding a tinge of humour and wit  to  keep\r\n\r\neveryone in good spirits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always wondered whether the Speaker really\r\n\r\nlistened  to our speeches, especially to some of us who  have\r\n\r\nthe tendency of making long speeches.  I am sure he must have\r\n\r\nheard  the same arguments repeated many times over  the  many\r\n\r\nyears.   While I confirm that he was indeed listening to  the\r\n\r\nspeeches that we made when I read the Sunday Times' interview\r\n\r\ntwo  Sundays ago, in the interview, Mr Tan analysed a  number\r\n\r\nof  MPs' speeches and the style of arguments, and I must  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  right.  Now we know that he was listening  all\r\n\r\nalong and not sleeping with his eyes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen.   But,  seriously,  many times after  each  sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  Mr  Tan made it a point to  stay  back  and  sit\r\n\r\naround  the  table  in the Members' Room  with  a  number  of\r\n\r\nMembers  each time to discuss issues.  During those sessions,\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  used to discuss the contents of debates and speeches\r\n\r\nwith  the  Members present and always giving his  views  and,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly, giving pointers to Members, especially  to\r\n\r\nnew  Members, on how we should handle debates and discussions\r\n\r\nin  the  House.  His many years of listening to and analysing\r\n\r\nmany  arguments have always been a great source of  knowledge\r\n\r\nwhich I found useful for my future speeches.\r\n\r\nTalking about pointers, one of the more significant things  I\r\n\r\nremember  and  cherish of Mr Tan's role  as  Speaker  is  his\r\n\r\nreaching  out to the new Members of Parliament.  As a  first-time  MP  during  the  last term, I  really  appreciated  his\r\n\r\nfriendly approach with the new Members, helping us to quickly\r\n\r\nlearn  the ropes of being a Member of Parliament, both inside\r\n\r\nand  outside  the  House.   He readily  helped,  coached  and\r\n\r\nmentored  many  of us so that we could in a short  period  of\r\n\r\ntime  start  making  contributions towards the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocess.  With his proactive approach of connecting with  the\r\n\r\nnew MPs, it made all of us feel very much at home and allowed\r\n\r\nus  to  quickly become more effective in doing  our  jobs  as\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament.  Especially for us Backbenchers,  we\r\n\r\nalso  picked up skills on how to handle a debate and  how  to\r\n\r\nmake  Question Time more effective in getting the answers  we\r\n\r\nwere looking for from the Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that I also cherish about Mr Tan, as Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  how lively he is outside the House, especially when we go\r\n\r\nfor  overseas  trips.   One can understand  the  need  to  be\r\n\r\nlively,  especially after many hours of sitting and listening\r\n\r\nto  speeches.  I can safely say that Mr Tan is the  liveliest\r\n\r\nof  all the Speakers in the ASEAN Parliaments, and I am  sure\r\n\r\nthis  is  also the opinion of all the ASEAN MPs who  attended\r\n\r\nour  yearly  AIPO Conference.  As Dr Wang mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\nentertaining everyone with his songs of the 1960s and 70s, we\r\n\r\nalways enjoyed the functions held\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  each  of  his  conferences.  You  have  to  know  your\r\n\r\nrock-and-roll when you are with Mr Tan on one of  his  trips.\r\n\r\nIf  not, then you have to dance, maybe a Bhangra dance, which\r\n\r\nI  had to do in one of those trips with him.  Perhaps singing\r\n\r\nwas  the  way  Mr  Tan let off his stress  accumulated  after\r\n\r\nlistening to many speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I am sure that we are all looking forward\r\n\r\nto  the  former  Speaker finally speaking  up  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nduring this current term.  Now is your chance, Mr Tan, to get\r\n\r\nback  at some of us for the long speeches that we made  while\r\n\r\nyou  were  in the Chair.  You have earned the right  to  make\r\n\r\nlong speeches this time round, although I hope you do not.  I\r\n\r\npersonally look forward to seeing you in action to contribute\r\n\r\ntowards  the making of a lively Parliament during this  term.\r\n\r\nNow, whenever you have itch to speak, you do not have to hold\r\n\r\nback, as you did when you were sitting on the Chair.  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nshould know all the tricks of how to catch the Speaker's eye,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure he is going to get quite a lot of  attention\r\n\r\nfrom the new Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of all the former and current Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse, I would like to thank Mr Tan for all that he has  done\r\n\r\nfor  the  Singapore Parliament and for Singapore.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nall  Members  will join me in wishing him all  the  best  and\r\n\r\nsuccess in whatever he chooses to do in the future.  Mr  Tan,\r\n\r\na  big  thank  you  for your excellent contributions  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\njoin  the  Leader  of  the House and the  other  speakers  in\r\n\r\ncongratulating  you on your election as the Speaker  of  this\r\n\r\naugust  House.  You have been a sportsman, and we  have  also\r\n\r\nread  and known you as the Minister for Sports, and I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition will be very confident that you  shall  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  fair  person  in dealing with the proceedings  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have read in the papers that your advice to\r\n\r\nMembers is to be \"short and sweet\" in their speeches,  and  I\r\n\r\ncan assure you that the Opposition shall do that, no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  six-hour speeches as in the past.  So far, anyway,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition has always made their speeches short and sweet.  I\r\n\r\nknow  you shall be a very efficient and fair Speaker  and  we\r\n\r\nshall look forward to more fair debates in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also take this opportunity to thank Mr Tan Soo Khoon\r\n\r\nfor his job as Speaker.  I had complained once or twice to Mr\r\n\r\nTan Soo Khoon that I failed to catch his eye when I put up my\r\n\r\nhand.   But  I  think  he  was too  busy  looking  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I  have  known Mr Tan very  well  through  our\r\n\r\nofficial visits to the ASEAN areas, in AIPO conferences, and,\r\n\r\nas  other speakers have said, before we go to these meetings,\r\n\r\nwe  have to brush up on our singing, because this is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  things that he loves to do.  I was once caught  unawares\r\n\r\nwhen he was announcing the Singapore delegates' programme  in\r\n\r\none of the ASEAN conferences - I believe it was in Bali - and\r\n\r\nhe  suddenly  called  my  name to represent  Singapore  in  a\r\n\r\nsinging event.  Can you imagine, I have to stand up and  sing\r\n\r\nin  front  of  an  international crowd  without  preparation?\r\n\r\nWell,  this is Mr Tan.  But, anyway, we have lots of fun  and\r\n\r\nwe come to know each other very well.  And I must say that he\r\n\r\nis  not  only respected in this House but he is respected  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  as  well.  Everywhere he went,  I  noticed  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of the other Parliaments in the region all respected\r\n\r\nhim.  I have got to thank Mr Tan for a job well done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> May I join the other\r\n\r\nMembers in congratulating you on your election as Speaker  of\r\n\r\nthe  House.  Sir, I have known you for a long time and  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that you will carry out the duties of Speaker  with\r\n\r\ndistinction and bring honour to the Chair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been the Speaker for the past 13 years and\r\n\r\nit has been a privilege and an honour to serve.  Sir, this is\r\n\r\nyour  election, the moment is rightly yours.  And although  I\r\n\r\nhave  expected  some words of thanks, I did not  foresee  the\r\n\r\nkind of tributes that Members have paid to me a while ago and\r\n\r\nI  am  indeed very humbled by what they have said.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat I would not have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  able to carry out my duties as Speaker for the past  13\r\n\r\nyears  the way I had done if I had not enjoyed the confidence\r\n\r\nand  their trust.  It is the Members of this House  who  have\r\n\r\nmade  my  job  easy  by  upholding the finest  traditions  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary   practices,  by  upholding  decorum   and   by\r\n\r\nrespecting  the rules of the House and the authority  of  the\r\n\r\nChair.  For that, I am really grateful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am the first Speaker in our Parliament to return\r\n\r\nto  the  Backbench, but this is not new in other Parliaments.\r\n\r\nAnd  I hope that in the years ahead, I will be able to humbly\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that  there is life after  Speakership  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   I would therefore like to assure the Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  and most certainly the Frontbench, that I, with  your\r\n\r\nkind permission, Sir, will be around to make more than a  few\r\n\r\nspeeches and certainly to ask more than a few questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may just take a few more moments\r\n\r\nto  say something about the Speakership, particularly for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the newer Members of the House.  The Speakership\r\n\r\nis  unique  in every country.  It is found in all Parliaments\r\n\r\nin  the Commonwealth that have adopted the Westminster system\r\n\r\nof parliamentary democracy.  The Speakership is as old as the\r\n\r\nhistory of Parliament.  In England where it all started,  the\r\n\r\nfirst designated Speaker was in the year 1377, although  long\r\n\r\nbefore that there were others who held the position but  they\r\n\r\nwent by other titles.  The Speaker in those early days had  a\r\n\r\ndifferent   role  to  play.   He  was  not  the  arbiter   of\r\n\r\nproceedings as we know him to be now.  The Speaker  in  those\r\n\r\ndays,  his  primary  duty, was to  convey  to  the  King  the\r\n\r\nresolutions  of the commons.  And you can well  imagine  that\r\n\r\nduring  those times, when the ruler was the absolute  monarch\r\n\r\nof  the land, he was usually not too pleased to receive  news\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Speaker, especially when what the Speaker  had  to\r\n\r\nconvey  impinged on the rights and privileges  of  the  King,\r\n\r\nparticularly  his royal purse.  Quite often, the  King  would\r\n\r\nknow  how  to  show his displeasure, and it was  recorded  in\r\n\r\nhistory that his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndispleasure was often manifested through a very simple act  - the  beheading of the Speaker.  And between the 15th and 16th\r\n\r\ncentury,  as many as up to 10 Speakers lost their poor  heads\r\n\r\nbecause  they delivered news that the ruler did not  want  to\r\n\r\nhear.   The  situation got so bad that in the year 1510,  two\r\n\r\nSpeakers lost their heads on the same day!  Hence, today,  in\r\n\r\nthe  English Parliament, we have this faint reluctance on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the aspirant to the post of Speaker.  Because  they\r\n\r\nare afraid of what will happen to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, today, times have changed. We do not have\r\n\r\nkings  and  queens,  not  in  the  other  countries  of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,  but in their place we have a government,  duly\r\n\r\nelected  by  the  people.  The role of the Speaker  has  also\r\n\r\nchanged.   He is now the one who conducts the proceedings  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  and he ensures its orderly conduct.  The  Speaker\r\n\r\nhas  also  become known as the guardian and the protector  of\r\n\r\nthe privileges of the Members of the House.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would like to recall again another event in  English\r\n\r\nhistory   which  has  a  bearing  on  how  Speakers   conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves everywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this took place in the year 1642. The King of the\r\n\r\nday was Charles I.  The Speaker of the English Parliament was\r\n\r\na  gentleman by the name of William Lenthall.  Charles I  had\r\n\r\nmore  than  his fair share of bad days with Parliament.   And\r\n\r\nthe  occasion  came  when he decided to  teach  Parliament  a\r\n\r\nlesson.   He  wanted  to  arrest himself  five  parliamentary\r\n\r\nleaders.   So  he marched to Parliament and he  demanded  the\r\n\r\nidentification  of  the  five members  that  he  wanted.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in those days, they had no photographs.  So he  asked\r\n\r\neveryone, and he was met with stony silence.  Then turning to\r\n\r\nWilliam  Lenthall, he asked the Speaker to identify the  five\r\n\r\nMembers.  And this was Lenthall's reply:  \"May it please Your\r\n\r\nMajesty,  I have neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak  in\r\n\r\nthis  place, except as the House, whose servant I am  directs\r\n\r\nof  me, and I beg Your Majesty's pardon that I have no  other\r\n\r\nanswer  to  give except this to what Your Majesty demands  of\r\n\r\nme\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those few well chosen but historic words,\r\n\r\nWilliam Lenthall expressed unequivocally where his first duty\r\n\r\nand  obligation  as Speaker lay.  He told  everyone,  and  he\r\n\r\nestablished  the principle, that his allegiance  was  to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  parliamentary  liberty.   And  with  parliamentary\r\n\r\nliberty lies the privilege for all of us in the House to make\r\n\r\nour  speeches, to express freely our views and our  opinions,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  rules of the Standing  Orders  and  to  the\r\n\r\nunwritten   rules  that  govern  our  conduct  as  honourable\r\n\r\ngentlemen  and honourable ladies.  And that, Sir, is  what  I\r\n\r\nhope to see in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, William Lenthall's words have become a kind of\r\n\r\ncreed for Speakers of the Commonwealth.  These are words that\r\n\r\nwe  recall  whenever Speakers meet.  I hope,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciple which he has established will also guide you in the\r\n\r\nconduct of the proceedings here.  During the course of  time,\r\n\r\nas  I  have experienced, you will no doubt get many  requests\r\n\r\nfrom  Members.  You will also get advice from both  sides  of\r\n\r\nthe  House, some are well-intended; some perhaps with  agenda\r\n\r\nof their own.  But I am hopeful, Sir, knowing you so well, as\r\n\r\nyou  were my Deputy for some years, that you will be able  to\r\n\r\nbe fair in your judgement and be very balanced in the way you\r\n\r\nconduct the proceedings of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that, if you do so, you too will earn the\r\n\r\nrespect  of  all of us here and of Singaporeans  in  general.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  am hopeful that when the time comes when you have  to\r\n\r\nleave the Chair, you too will be able to leave with your head\r\n\r\nheld  up  high  and, of course, still firmly  fixed  on  your\r\n\r\nshoulders.  Much obliged, Sir.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members, I would first like to\r\n\r\nthank  the Leader of the House and Dr Wang, Mr Low, Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nand   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  for  their  very  kind  words  and\r\n\r\ncongratulatory messages.  I also like to thank Mr Tan for his\r\n\r\ndiscourse  on the history of the Speakership and I am  indeed\r\n\r\nglad that times have changed because I do intend to retain my\r\n\r\nhead on my shoulders!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, I wish to thank you for electing me\r\n\r\nto this high office.  This is my 18th year as a Member of the\r\n\r\nHouse,  and  in those years I have been privileged  to  serve\r\n\r\nfirst as a member of the Backbench, then on to the Frontbench\r\n\r\nand  now,  with this election, on to the Chair of the  House.\r\n\r\nHonourable Members have indeed done me a great honour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall do my utmost to fulfil the trust and confidence\r\n\r\nthat  Members have put in me to preside over the  proceedings\r\n\r\nof  this  House and to preserve the dignity and role of  this\r\n\r\naugust  institution.  I shall be impartial as Members  expect\r\n\r\nme to be.  In these, I have the fortune of having learnt from\r\n\r\nprevious  Honourable Speakers, particularly from  Mr  Speaker\r\n\r\nTan  Soo  Khoon, when I was one of his Deputies from 1989  to\r\n\r\n1993.  He had served with distinction indeed.  And this House\r\n\r\nowes  him  a  great debt of gratitude for his leadership  and\r\n\r\nguidance when he was in the Chair for the past 13 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to warmly welcome the new Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse.   With 26 new Members representing a wide  variety  of\r\n\r\nprofessions,  experiences and interests and  coupled  with  a\r\n\r\ngreater  willingness to articulate differing  views,  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  a livelier and more vibrant Parliament from  now  on.\r\n\r\nAs  new Members, I would urge you to acquaint yourselves with\r\n\r\nthe  rules  of  debate  and conduct  in  this  House.   Speak\r\n\r\nhonestly,  speak  sincerely and without  fear  and  let  your\r\n\r\nconscience be your guide.  But be as concise as you  can  and\r\n\r\ntry  hard  to avoid repetition.  Long and rambling  speeches,\r\n\r\nespecially  when short on substance, tend to  receive  little\r\n\r\nattention from the benches and may even evoke a subtle  frown\r\n\r\nfrom  this  Chair.  As in economics, such speeches  are  also\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the  laws of diminishing  returns!   So  let  us\r\n\r\nconduct  ourselves as befits the status and dignity  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament.   But  this does not mean that  I  am  averse  to\r\n\r\nMembers including wit and good humour in your speeches, where\r\n\r\nthey are appropriate.  Not only will they add sparkle to what\r\n\r\nyou  say,  but  also  help to lift our  spirits  and  eyelids\r\n\r\nparticularly on long drowsy afternoons!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of new Members, I remember Mr Speaker the late\r\n\r\nDr Yeoh Ghim Seng lamenting that he had only the shape of the\r\n\r\nspectacle frames of Members to help him recognise them by.  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  that this method will help me little,  given  the\r\n\r\nproliferation of rimless spectacles now among Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse.   So,  if  I  have trouble matching  names  to  faces,\r\n\r\ninitially, please bear with me as I grapple and struggle with\r\n\r\nthe whims of fashions in eyewear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this possibly small difficulty and with\r\n\r\nMembers'  help  and cooperation, I expect our proceedings  to\r\n\r\nrun smoothly and our debates to be robust and meaningful.   I\r\n\r\nlook  forward  to  a fruitful session and I  wish  Honourable\r\n\r\nMembers  all the best in the performance of their duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities as Members of Parliament of the Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The Asian Financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrisis  overwhelmed many economies in the region.   Singapore\r\n\r\nwas   not   spared.   Our  economy  slowed  down   as   well.\r\n\r\nFortunately we pulled through and recovered quickly.  Then in\r\n\r\n2001  the  US economy slowed, the global electronics industry\r\n\r\nslumped,  and we experienced our most severe recession  since\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now emerging from this recession. But we are not\r\n\r\nback  to  the  pre-crisis days of steady, high  growth.   The\r\n\r\nworld  has changed.  The next few years will present us  with\r\n\r\nthe most severe challenges in our nation's history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tougher Global Competition</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we face much tougher competition, because of\r\n\r\nglobalisation.   Despite  problems  in  the  world   economy,\r\n\r\nglobalisation  has  not  let up.   In  many  industries,  for\r\n\r\nexample electronics and finance, competition is global.  This\r\n\r\ntrend is driven by technology, which is advancing faster than\r\n\r\never.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Asian economies like Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  are pursuing the same opportunities as we are, growing\r\n\r\ntheir  IT  sectors, investing in life sciences and  competing\r\n\r\nfor global talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New players are emerging in the world economy. As they\r\n\r\nstrengthen   their  capabilities,  they  will  attract   more\r\n\r\ninvestments,  and export more sophisticated  products.   They\r\n\r\nwill  increasingly  compete with  countries  ahead  of  them,\r\n\r\nincluding Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important new player is China. China's low\r\n\r\ncosts,   abundant  talent,  and  huge  domestic  market   are\r\n\r\nattracting  MNCs to relocate plants to China.   Good  quality\r\n\r\nbut  cheaper  Chinese  products are flooding  world  markets.\r\n\r\nAdapting  to  China's  emergence and economic  transformation\r\n\r\nwill  pose  a  major  challenge  for  many  Asian  countries,\r\n\r\nincluding Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>South East Asia</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our own region has been fundamentally altered.\r\n\r\nFor  three decades, Southeast Asia was stable, with countries\r\n\r\nfocussing  on  economic development and peaceful competition.\r\n\r\nSingapore benefited greatly from this benign environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Financial Crisis changed this. It uncovered\r\n\r\nserious  flaws  in  the economies which  will  take  time  to\r\n\r\nremedy.   Meanwhile,  growth will be slower,  and  investment\r\n\r\nopportunities will be fewer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, a country key to the stability of the\r\n\r\nregion,  the crisis did not just cause economic  damage.   It\r\n\r\nprecipitated a collapse of the old order, unleashed  tectonic\r\n\r\nforces  in Indonesian society, and set off political  changes\r\n\r\nwhich are still being worked out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the spread of narrow, radical interpretations of\r\n\r\nIslam in the countries around us, influenced by the worldwide\r\n\r\ntide  of Islamic fundamentalism, will have its effect on  our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial, multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A troubled region, and an ASEAN preoccupied with\r\n\r\ninternal  problems,  mean  fewer  growth  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nSingapore in the region.  And security problems that arise in\r\n\r\nthe region will inevitably spill over to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Global Terrorism</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third significant external development is the war\r\n\r\nagainst  terrorism.  The Taleban and Al Qaeda may  have  been\r\n\r\nrouted  in  Afghanistan, but global  terrorism  is  far  from\r\n\r\ndefeated.  Terrorist cells, linked to global networks,  exist\r\n\r\nin  many countries, including in Southeast Asia.  The  Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah terrorist group is a stark reminder that these  are\r\n\r\nnot  faraway problems, but immediate threats to us  here  and\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger to us is two-fold. Firstly, we are directly\r\n\r\nat risk of terrorist attacks, especially by Islamic extremist\r\n\r\ngroups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noriginating elsewhere in the region.  Such attacks will cause\r\n\r\nsuspicion and arouse enmity between our races.  Secondly,  US\r\n\r\naction  against  global terrorism may cause repercussions  in\r\n\r\nMuslim  countries, and complicate the situation in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>CHALLENGES FOR SINGAPORE</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new environment that we are now in. Our\r\n\r\nfuture  depends  on how we respond to these economic,  social\r\n\r\nand political changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make basic changes to our economy, to stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive in an economically changed world, and continue to\r\n\r\nprosper.   Hence we set up the Economic Review  Committee  to\r\n\r\nexamine  fundamentally all our economic policies, and propose\r\n\r\nfresh strategies to sustain growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is in the midst of its work. But it is\r\n\r\nclear  already that one key priority is to maintain a  highly\r\n\r\nconducive  overall business environment.   For  example,  our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  must  be first-class  but  their  costs  kept\r\n\r\ncompetitive, to anchor businesses here and keep  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nregional  hub.  And we must encourage effort and  enterprise,\r\n\r\nas   the  best  way  of  creating  jobs  and  improving   the\r\n\r\nlivelihoods of Singaporeans.  Our taxes must be kept as light\r\n\r\nas  possible,  to maximise the incentive for  businesses  and\r\n\r\nindividuals  to venture and work hard in the  hope  of  doing\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another priority is to strengthen the spirit of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and risk taking among Singaporeans  as  the\r\n\r\nbasis  for  Singapore's  future competitiveness.   We  should\r\n\r\ninculcate  in  the  young  a more inquiring  and  adventurous\r\n\r\nspirit,  and encourage them to think up new ideas and  create\r\n\r\nnew  opportunities.  Developing arts, sports and  a  stronger\r\n\r\ncivic society are part of the process to bring this about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs not only create jobs and wealth. They\r\n\r\nmake our whole economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  dynamic  and  vibrant, and help  us  adapt  to  changed\r\n\r\nconditions  and  exploit  new  opportunities.   Strong  local\r\n\r\nenterprises,  both start-ups and established companies,  will\r\n\r\ncomplement the MNCs and add depth to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also identify new areas of growth, especially in\r\n\r\nservices.  We have already started liberalising the  services\r\n\r\nindustry,   notably  the  telecommunications  and   financial\r\n\r\nsectors.   We  must  also  upgrade sectors  like  retail  and\r\n\r\nconstruction,  whose  productivity  is  lagging  behind.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to shelter inefficient, protected  sectors  in\r\n\r\nour   economy.   All  parts  of  our  economy   must   become\r\n\r\ncompetitive and efficient, for that is the only way to create\r\n\r\nproductive, well-paying jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will enable us to sustain growth over the\r\n\r\nnext  decade.   But the competition is now much tougher,  and\r\n\r\nour  income levels are much higher than before.   We  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger expect to grow by 8 to 10%, year after year, as we did\r\n\r\nbefore the Asian Financial Crisis, even if we were to work as\r\n\r\nhard  as  or harder than before.  That phase of our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment is over.  Going forward, if we can make 4  to  6%\r\n\r\ngrowth  per  year, we will be doing well.  We must understand\r\n\r\nand accept this reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Cohesion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we upgrade our economy, we must maintain and\r\n\r\nstrengthen our social cohesion.  Economic restructuring means\r\n\r\nadjustments  and  dislocation.   It  will  not  be  easy  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to cope with the faster pace of change, and  the\r\n\r\ndemands for new skills.  But we must press on, or risk  being\r\n\r\novertaken by our competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our income distribution will stretch out. In the\r\n\r\nglobalised  economy, the rewards are greatest for those  with\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge, skills and enterprise.  Those at the top will\r\n\r\ndo  very  well.   But at the lower end, those without  skills\r\n\r\nwill  have difficulty raising their incomes, or even  finding\r\n\r\njobs.  This is already happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should celebrate Singaporeans who do well. By their\r\n\r\nsuccess,  they will create more jobs, build up  our  economy,\r\n\r\nand  provide role models for others.  But to uplift the whole\r\n\r\npopulation,  we must redouble our emphasis on  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining.   Workers must stay employable, and find  new  jobs\r\n\r\nwhen  their  old jobs become obsolete.  They  must  make  the\r\n\r\neffort, to undergo retraining and to adapt to the changed job\r\n\r\nmarket.  We must never allow an underclass to form, left  out\r\n\r\nfrom  growth,  deprived  of opportunities,  and  perpetuating\r\n\r\npoverty and despair from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help Singaporeans to make the\r\n\r\nchanges,  especially  those groups who will  have  difficulty\r\n\r\nadapting, such as older citizens.  We have the programmes and\r\n\r\nthe resources to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have spread the fruits of Singapore's progress\r\n\r\nwidely,  through HDB home ownership, excellent schools,  good\r\n\r\nhealth care, and asset enhancement schemes.  We will continue\r\n\r\nto  do  this,  to  make  sure that in the  next  phase,  life\r\n\r\nimproves for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must attract and integrate international talent\r\n\r\ninto  our society.  Talent is the critical success factor  in\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  economy.   We will continue  to  develop  the\r\n\r\nabilities  and  skills  of young Singaporeans  to  the  full.\r\n\r\nWithout  capable and enterprising Singaporeans, we  will  not\r\n\r\nmake  it  in the knowledge economy.  But we are too small  to\r\n\r\nproduce, by ourselves, all the talent that we need.  Even the\r\n\r\ndeveloped   countries   are   now   actively   sourcing   for\r\n\r\ninternational talent, including from our part of  the  world.\r\n\r\nWe  must  supplement our own talent with talent from  abroad.\r\n\r\nOnly  then  can  we  sustain exceptional  performance  as  an\r\n\r\neconomy and a country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our success in attracting talent, a\r\n\r\nsignificant  proportion of Singaporeans are first  generation\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  These people bring with them skills,  experience\r\n\r\nand  drive  which will enrich and strengthen us.   They  are,\r\n\r\nhowever, different from Singaporeans who have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrown  up,  studied  and worked here  for  many  years.   Our\r\n\r\nsociety  must  be open and welcoming to newcomers.   We  must\r\n\r\nmake them feel at home and in time absorb them as one of  us.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow resentment and tensions to build up against\r\n\r\nnewcomers.    In  the  globalised  economy,  a   closed   and\r\n\r\nxenophobic society will not prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and most critical aspect of social cohesion is\r\n\r\nreinforcing our racial and religious harmony.  We  have  made\r\n\r\nsteady   progress   integrating  the  different   races   and\r\n\r\nreligions, but the task is never complete.  The tendency  for\r\n\r\ndifferent   groups,  with  different  customs  and  religious\r\n\r\naffinities,  to interact and seek comfort amongst  themselves\r\n\r\nwill  always be present.  Given today's heightened  religious\r\n\r\nconsciousness, we must move beyond mere tolerance,  in  order\r\n\r\nto  enhance  appreciation and build  confidence  amongst  the\r\n\r\ndifferent groups.  We must re-double our efforts to encourage\r\n\r\nmore  mixing  and  interaction between the  communities,  and\r\n\r\ngradually  widen  the  common ground  that  all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain its impartial, secular\r\n\r\napproach  to  managing religious diversity.  We will  protect\r\n\r\nthe  minority communities, their cultures and their  ways  of\r\n\r\nlife.  At the same time, all groups must be willing to adjust\r\n\r\nand  compromise, in order to live harmoniously  in  a  multi-racial, multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah arrests highlighted the fault lines\r\n\r\nin  our  society.   Had the group succeeded  in  setting  off\r\n\r\nmultiple bombs in Singapore, it would not only have cost many\r\n\r\ninnocent  Singaporean lives.  It would have  caused  distrust\r\n\r\nand  enmity between Muslims and other Singaporeans, and  torn\r\n\r\nour social fabric apart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah group has been broken up, but the\r\n\r\nproblem  has  not  gone  away.  The virus  of  terrorism  has\r\n\r\ninfected  our region.  Other groups will form,  and  at  some\r\n\r\ntime, will try again.  This is why we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  strengthen  inter-ethnic  relations,  for  example,  by\r\n\r\nforming  Inter-Racial Confidence Circles and Harmony Circles.\r\n\r\nWe  must  make  sure that should such an attack  ever  occur,\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the different communities can work  together  to\r\n\r\ncontain  the  damage, re-establish trust and confidence,  and\r\n\r\nprevent further harm to our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Political Renewal</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In politics, we must remake our policies to fit a new\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans, and adapt our style and  approach\r\n\r\nto  stay  in  tune with the times.  No policy is so  cast  in\r\n\r\nstone   that   it   can  never  be  changed,   whatever   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Provided  we  recognise  the  realities   of\r\n\r\nsurvival   in   Southeast  Asia,  and  remember   Singapore's\r\n\r\nfundamental constraints and vulnerabilities, we can widen the\r\n\r\nout-of-bounds markers in a realistic and practical way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life experiences of the new generation are quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from those of their parents.  With the benefit  of\r\n\r\ngood   education,   their  options  are  wider,   and   their\r\n\r\nexpectations  higher.  This is natural  and  positive.   Each\r\n\r\ngeneration strives to give their children a better  life  and\r\n\r\nbrighter future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must engage young Singaporeans in issues which affect\r\n\r\ntheir  future.   Singaporeans  are  now  better  equipped  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the national debate, and more ready to discuss\r\n\r\nsensitive matters in public.  We must open up more space  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to do so.  This is an important way  to  harness\r\n\r\nthe  ideas, idealism and dynamism of the young, while keeping\r\n\r\ntheir hearts and minds rooted in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more vigorous debate should not lead to more\r\n\r\nfractious  and  polarised politics.  We  enjoy  a  broad  and\r\n\r\nstrong  national consensus on the direction which the country\r\n\r\nshould  take.  This consensus is a major advantage  over  our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   We must nurture it by pursuing policies  which\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  majority of Singaporeans, and by enlisting  the\r\n\r\nenergies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  support  of all those who have Singapore's interests  at\r\n\r\nheart,  including those who disagree with specific Government\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true test of our nation building is whether\r\n\r\nSingapore's  success endures beyond the founding  generation.\r\n\r\nWe  have  made  one  successful transition,  from  the  first\r\n\r\ngeneration  leaders to the second.  During the term  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament,  we expect to make another political  transition.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the next generation of political leadership is\r\n\r\nalready  in  place.  Before the next elections in  2007,  the\r\n\r\ncore  members of the new team must establish themselves,  and\r\n\r\ntake Singapore another step forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at a turning point. The challenges are\r\n\r\nformidable,  but  we are well equipped to tackle  them.   Our\r\n\r\nsystem  is  transparent, efficient and  corruption-free.   We\r\n\r\nhave  pursued forward-looking, rational and prudent policies.\r\n\r\nWe  have  invested heavily in our people, and built a  stable\r\n\r\nand cohesive society, an oasis in a turbulent region.  Let us\r\n\r\nremake  Singapore together, so that despite the  difficulties\r\n\r\nand  dangers,  we will continue to thrive and prosper  in  an\r\n\r\nuncertain world.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Eleven</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THE FIRST SESSION OF THE TENTH PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ON MONDAY, 25TH MARCH 2002</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR LIM HNG KIANG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Health</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Health strives to achieve a more\r\n\r\ncost-effective  health care system to  keep  Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\ngood  health.   We  aim  to provide good quality  preventive,\r\n\r\npromotive  and  curative health care which is affordable  and\r\n\r\naccessible to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Making Health Care Affordable</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Ministry will continue to strengthen the 3M\r\n\r\nframework  (Medisave,  MediShield  and  Medifund)   so   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are better able to pay their  share  of  health\r\n\r\ncare  costs.   We will study how best to extend  Medisave  to\r\n\r\ncover  ambulatory and outpatient treatments, and  review  the\r\n\r\nadequacy  of  Medisave in meeting the health  care  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will expand the role of medical insurance in\r\n\r\nfinancing  health  care  costs.  ElderShield,  an  affordable\r\n\r\nbasic severe disability insurance scheme, will be implemented\r\n\r\nin  the third quarter of 2002.  New MediShield features  such\r\n\r\nas  lifetime  coverage and pre-funding will be introduced  by\r\n\r\n2003  so  that  Singaporeans  are  better  protected  against\r\n\r\ncatastrophic  illnesses.   We  will  also  facilitate  family\r\n\r\ncoverage  for  MediShield  so that  non-working  spouses  are\r\n\r\nadequately protected.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The introduction of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs)\r\n\r\nto  the  public  health care system in 1999 has  allowed  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  target  more subsidies for  medical  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  require more resources to treat.  We will  re-set  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  withdrawal limits and MediShield  claimable  limits\r\n\r\nfor  inpatient and day surgery cases to be based on  DRGs  in\r\n\r\n2003,  to reflect the resources needed to treat the different\r\n\r\nmedical conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Despite more effective resource allocation with the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of DRGs, demand for health care  services  will\r\n\r\nstill  outpace the additional resources allocated.  To ensure\r\n\r\nthat  health  care subsidies are targeted at  the  low-income\r\n\r\ngroups who deserve the most financial help, we will introduce\r\n\r\nselective means testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bringing Health Care Facilities Closer to Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will develop two new regional general hospitals\r\n\r\nto  provide broad-based general medical care to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nJurong  General  Hospital,  which will  replace  the  current\r\n\r\nAlexandra Hospital, will be completed by 2006, while Northern\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital  will  be  completed  by  2008.   Community\r\n\r\nhospitals  will  be  built next to  these  two  hospitals  to\r\n\r\nprovide  convenient  access to step-down  care  services  for\r\n\r\nelderly Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. By 2006, we will also complete the new\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  Centre (RC) and Communicable  Disease  Centre\r\n\r\n(CDC)  at  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital campus.   The  RC  will\r\n\r\nfunction  as  a  tertiary centre providing  multidisciplinary\r\n\r\nintensive rehabilitation services in specialised areas.   The\r\n\r\nnew  CDC  will  serve as the national centre  for  diagnosis,\r\n\r\ntreatment and control of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. At the primary care level, the Ministry will\r\n\r\ndevelop new polyclinics in Jurong West and Sengkang, and  re-develop the existing Queenstown polyclinic.  These three  new\r\n\r\npolyclinics will be ready by 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Integrated Health Care for the Elderly</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To address the needs of our rapidly ageing\r\n\r\npopulation,  the Ministry has established the  framework  for\r\n\r\nintegrated  health services for the elderly.  We will  extend\r\n\r\nthis to include dementia care and strengthen home medical and\r\n\r\nhome nursing services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  our  elderly can be cared for  by  the  family  and\r\n\r\ncommunity. We will also raise the quality assurance standards\r\n\r\nin  step-down  care facilities, and enforce the  requirements\r\n\r\nthrough  the  licensing  and  clinical  audit  process.    In\r\n\r\naddition, we will continue to reserve and tender land parcels\r\n\r\nto  the  private sector to increase the proportion of private\r\n\r\nnursing home beds to 40% by 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Seamless Health Care Delivery</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Ministry has completed the restructuring of all\r\n\r\npublic healthcare institutions and re-organised them into two\r\n\r\nvertically  integrated health care delivery networks,  namely\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Health Services and National Healthcare Group.\r\n\r\nThe  two clusters will undertake further integration of their\r\n\r\nservices  to provide better seamless health care  service  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Both clusters will also collaborate  and  co-operate to minimise wasteful duplication.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe  will  explore  opportunities for  greater  public-private\r\n\r\nsector  collaboration,  in  order to  harness  all  available\r\n\r\nresources to raise standards of health care to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health Promotion and Disease Control</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. To keep Singaporeans in good health, the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill   continue  to  strengthen  disease  control  programmes\r\n\r\nagainst major chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease and\r\n\r\nstroke,  and major infectious diseases like tuberculosis  and\r\n\r\nHIV.   The  Health Promotion Board will spearhead efforts  to\r\n\r\nencourage  a  healthy and fit population.  It will  implement\r\n\r\nnational   screening  programmes  for  breast  and   cervical\r\n\r\ncancers,  and  extend  basic  oral  health  services  to  all\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pursuit of Clinical Quality</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The Ministry is enhancing the clinical quality\r\n\r\nassurance  framework to improve the standard and  quality  of\r\n\r\nhealth care.  By end-2003, we would have implemented hospital-wide  and speciality-specific clinical indicators to  monitor\r\n\r\nand improve clinical service provision.  At the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we will revise and issue regulations  under  the\r\n\r\nPrivate  Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, to stipulate  the\r\n\r\nscope  and  depth of quality assurance and infection  control\r\n\r\nactivities required of hospitals.  In addition, a  system  to\r\n\r\ndetect and mitigate potential sources of medical errors would\r\n\r\nbe put in place.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will review and\r\n\r\nupdate the Medicines Act, Poisons Act, Sale of Drugs Act  and\r\n\r\nMedicine (Advertisements and Sales) Act.  One area of concern\r\n\r\nis  to  provide  for  the appropriate  regulation  of  health\r\n\r\nproducts  such  as medical devices and health supplements  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard public health and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing Professional Competence</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. The Ministry will work with the Singapore Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  to introduce compulsory Continuing Medical Education\r\n\r\nfor  doctors in 2003. Compulsory Continuing Medical Education\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that our doctors maintain professional standards\r\n\r\nand stay abreast of the rapid advances in medical science and\r\n\r\ntechnology.     We  will  also study the  need  to  introduce\r\n\r\nregular    re-certification   of   doctors,    taking    into\r\n\r\nconsideration the trends in developed countries.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nwe  will  work  with  the respective Professional  Boards  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   Continuing  Education  Programmes   for   nurses,\r\n\r\ndentists and pharmacists.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.

In  addition, we  will  ensure  that  other\r\n\r\naspects  of  a  quality living environment like  a  resilient\r\n\r\nsupply  of  safe  food  and  sufficient  avenues  for   green\r\n\r\nrecreation will be met effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Use Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Given Singapore's size, good land use planning is\r\n\r\ncritical  to  ensure that we can meet competing  demands  for\r\n\r\nland as well as put in place a quality living environment.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. MND will strive to optimise the use of our existing\r\n\r\nland.   For example, we will explore new land use zonings  to\r\n\r\ngive  businesses more flexibility to change the use of  their\r\n\r\nland to respond quickly to changing business needs and market\r\n\r\ndemand. We will study introducing a greater variety of  lease\r\n\r\ntenures  in Government land sales, to meet changing  business\r\n\r\nneeds   and   foster  experimentation  with  new  development\r\n\r\nconcepts.  We  are  also  exploring  releasing  a   site   of\r\n\r\nsignificant scale in the New Downtown area for the integrated\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a business and financial centre.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.

MND will continue to  ensure  that  public\r\n\r\nflats  are  priced  affordably to  enable  at  least  90%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean households to be homeowners.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.

New flats will be built  to  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  Singaporeans  to  choose a flat  according  to  their\r\n\r\nbudget,  preferred  location and design. We  will  offer  new\r\n\r\nflats in the more established estates to Singaporeans through\r\n\r\nregular   balloting  exercises.  We  will  also  make   flats\r\n\r\navailable  on a walk-in selection basis to those who  need  a\r\n\r\nflat   urgently.  We  will  explore  greater  private  sector\r\n\r\nparticipation in the design and development of  public  flats\r\n\r\nto inject competition and provide Singaporeans a wider choice\r\n\r\nof public flats in terms of designs, layout and finishes.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. MND will also continue to rejuvenate older HDB\r\n\r\nestates   through  the  Main,  Interim  and  Lift   Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes  and Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme.  This\r\n\r\nwill help households to remain in their existing estates  and\r\n\r\nhelp  preserve the community ties built over the  years.

For the longer term, MND will review the structure\r\n\r\nof  the  HDB  so that it continues to fulfil its  fundamental\r\n\r\nobjective of home ownership for Singaporeans.  We will review\r\n\r\nour  public  housing  policies to  keep  our  public  housing\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in line with economic growth, and to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  need for a balance between expenditures on housing,  and\r\n\r\nother areas such as health and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Moving Construction Ahead</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.

MND will step up efforts to diversify our  food\r\n\r\nsources.  We  will  help  our food  importers  broaden  their\r\n\r\nnetwork  of sources, stimulate the development of new sources\r\n\r\nof  supply  and  offer  consultancy  services  in  safe  food\r\n\r\nproduction techniques so that more sources can meet our  food\r\n\r\nsafety standards and supply to us.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. MND will also continue to ensure high standards of\r\n\r\nfood  safety  by  upgrading our diagnostic  capabilities  and\r\n\r\nsystems. We will work with the Ministry of the Environment to\r\n\r\nintegrate  and strengthen our food safety control  system  to\r\n\r\nensure the safety of both processed and unprocessed food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Meeting Demand for Green Recreation</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.

The  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill work closely with employers and trade unions to speed up\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the monthly variable component (MVC) as\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the  National Wage Council  (NWC),  so  that\r\n\r\ncompanies can adjust their monthly wage bill quickly when the\r\n\r\nneed  arises, to remain competitive and minimise job  losses.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also promote the adoption of performance-based  pay\r\n\r\nstructures over seniority-based wage system.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.

The mission of the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports (MCDS) is to build  a  cohesive  and\r\n\r\nresilient  society. Over the next 5 years, we will  focus  on\r\n\r\nthe following areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Building social capital to strengthen cohesion;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Strengthening the social safety net by linking timely and appropriate assistance to those in need with job counselling, training and placement; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Enhancing social services to help families discharge their care and support responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building Social Capital</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A cornerstone of building social capital is\r\n\r\nstrengthening multi-racial and multi-religious harmony.  MCDS\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  actively promote the integration  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races  and  religions in Singapore,  to  encourage\r\n\r\nacceptance  and mutual understanding across different  ethnic\r\n\r\nand  religious  groups, and expand the  common  spaces  where\r\n\r\ndifferent communities can interact in harmony.  We will  work\r\n\r\nwith  communal  and  religious organisations  to  expand  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  Singaporeans' religious tolerance.  The  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  will  press  on  to  build  up  our   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations to extend their reach to more Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nbring  them  together  to  work for  the  betterment  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. MCDS will continue to work with the National\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Social Service and the National Volunteer  Centre\r\n\r\nto  promote  active  citizenry  and  community  self-help  by\r\n\r\nencouraging volunteerism and philanthropy among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIn   particular,   MCDS   will  focus   on   increasing   the\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  of  the social service providers.   We  will\r\n\r\nwork  with the Community Development Councils to improve  the\r\n\r\ntraining of social workers at the district level in order  to\r\n\r\nincrease the responsiveness of social service agencies within\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Sports can contribute towards community bonding and\r\n\r\nenhancing  national pride.  For the individual, it cultivates\r\n\r\nperseverance, discipline and a healthy lifestyle.  MCDS will,\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Singapore  Sports  Council,  further  encourage\r\n\r\nsports    participation   and   sports    excellence    among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and promote the sports industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintaining the Social Safety Net</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.

The most effective long-term solution, however, is\r\n\r\nto continue to inculcate in Singaporeans, the values of self-\r\n\r\nreliance   and   the  dignity  of  work,  and   ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are employable and gainfully  employed.   MCDS,\r\n\r\ntogether  with other agencies, will encourage individuals  on\r\n\r\ngovernment assistance to return to work by linking short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  closely  with  job  counselling,   job\r\n\r\nsearch, training and placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Supporting Families</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Our low fertility rate, particularly among better\r\n\r\neducated  Singaporeans, continues to be an area  of  concern.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue to monitor demographic trends closely  and\r\n\r\nconsider new measures to address this problem.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The family is the basic unit of our society. MCDS\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to drive pro-family policies and  programmes,\r\n\r\nincluding  promoting family life education, a balanced  work-\r\n\r\nfamily  environment, and improved childcare and student  care\r\n\r\narrangements.  We will pay special attention to  the  welfare\r\n\r\nand  development  of  children from low-income  families  and\r\n\r\nfamilies  at  risk,  to  ensure  that  they  have  access  to\r\n\r\ndevelopmental and educational opportunities. In addition,  we\r\n\r\nwill  examine  the  needs  of  various  caregivers,  be  they\r\n\r\ncaregivers  to  children, the elderly  or  the  disabled,  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  how the community can offer services  and  support\r\n\r\nthat these caregivers need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>MUIS</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.

MOT will maintain and build on Singapore's leading\r\n\r\nposition  as  a global transportation and logistics  hub.  We\r\n\r\nwill  also  continue  to  provide Singaporeans  with  a  high\r\n\r\nquality yet affordable public transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maritime Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To meet the intensifying competition from\r\n\r\nneighbouring ports, MOT will continue to liberalise port  and\r\n\r\nmarine  services where appropriate, to ensure that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontinues  to provide high quality,  cost competitive  value-\r\n\r\nadded  services.   To  support  activities  of  the  maritime\r\n\r\nsector,  we  will  develop new ancillary services,  including\r\n\r\nmaritime R&D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will also leverage on our excellent port, road,\r\n\r\nIT   and   e-commerce   infrastructure  to   facilitate   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of an integrated logistics industry, covering the\r\n\r\nentire   chain   of   handling,   processing,   storage   and\r\n\r\ntransportation  of  goods,  as  well  as  the  management  of\r\n\r\ninformation flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. To consolidate our lead as a regional cruise hub,\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to work with other government agencies  and\r\n\r\nindustry   players  to  attract  fly-cruise   passengers   by\r\n\r\nleveraging on Changi's large foreign passenger base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Air Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Passenger traffic and airfreight through Changi\r\n\r\nhave  declined following the 911 attacks in the US. Singapore\r\n\r\nis  also  facing more intense competition from newer airports\r\n\r\nin neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To stay the premier air hub in the region, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue its liberal air transport policy, to\r\n\r\nextend  Changi's air network and connectivity  especially  to\r\n\r\nrapidly growing and emerging aviation markets such as China\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand India.  We will review incentives to attract new airlines\r\n\r\nand  to entrench existing ones in Singapore. CAAS will launch\r\n\r\njoint  promotion  and marketing activities with  airlines  to\r\n\r\nincrease their business through Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. CAAS will also ensure adequate capacity at Changi\r\n\r\nAirport. CAAS will soon embark on a major upgrade of Terminal\r\n\r\n2.  Development  of Terminal 3 will proceed  in  tandem  with\r\n\r\nprojections in traffic growth. Changi has opened  a  Business\r\n\r\nAviation  Centre,  offering  speedy  clearance  for  business\r\n\r\ntravellers travelling in executive jets. New cargo  terminals\r\n\r\nare  also  being  built  and the Airport  Logistics  Park  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   (ALPS)  will  open  in  2003  to  help   maintain\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as the premier integrated transport  and\r\n\r\nlogistics hub in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. MOT will continue to develop our road network to\r\n\r\nincrease  road capacity, improve connectivity and  strengthen\r\n\r\nstrategic  linkages  between major activity  and  residential\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. MOT will also review the vehicle restraint measures\r\n\r\nto allow more people to own cars. We will progressively shift\r\n\r\nfrom  a  reliance on ownership to usage control  measures  to\r\n\r\nmanage  the demand. The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)  System\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  Vehicle Quota  Scheme  (VQS)  have  been\r\n\r\neffective in checking congestion on our roads. The  ERP  will\r\n\r\nbe  expanded  further  to  form a second  cordon  beyond  the\r\n\r\nRestricted Zone, and extended to other areas and times of day\r\n\r\nwhere traffic conditions warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. There are limits, however, to road capacity. Beyond\r\n\r\na  certain car population, congestion is inevitable.  We must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to develop our public transport system as a  viable\r\n\r\nalternative.  We will expand the Rapid Transit  System  (RTS)\r\n\r\nnetwork into a comprehensive network to form the backbone  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  transport system. The North-East  Line  together\r\n\r\nwith  the Sengkang LRT will be completed this year.   Punggol\r\n\r\nLRT will be ready in 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond  that,  we  are  building the Circle  Line,  which  is\r\n\r\ntargeted  for  completion by 2010.  There are also  plans  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the Bukit Timah Line, the Eastern Region Line and  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Region Line within the next 10 to 15 years. With  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of these 3 new lines, the total RTS network  will\r\n\r\nmore than double to 240 km.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will also leverage on technology. We will create\r\n\r\na transport information hub that can provide public transport\r\n\r\ncommuters and motorists with real-time information on  public\r\n\r\ntransport arrival times and road traffic conditions. We  will\r\n\r\nreview public transport quality standards to better meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the commuter population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR DAVID T.

The Government expects companies it holds shares in\r\n\r\nto  operate commercially, without any preferential treatment.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these  companies  will  contribute  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nexternal economy by expanding into significant businesses  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  and  beyond.  The Government will  progressively\r\n\r\ndivest   its  commercial  investments  which  are  no  longer\r\n\r\nstrategic, as market conditions permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Budgeting Wisely</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.

The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September\r\n\r\n2001  and  the  on-going global anti-terrorist campaign  have\r\n\r\nadded  a  key element of uncertainty to world stability.  The\r\n\r\nend of the Cold War and globalisation have also fundamentally\r\n\r\nchanged the external environment for Singapore. Not only  are\r\n\r\nconvenient  distinctions between domestic  and  international\r\n\r\ninterests blurring, but the economic, political and  security\r\n\r\ninterests    of    states   can   no   longer    be    neatly\r\n\r\ncompartmentalised, instead interacting and overlapping  in  a\r\n\r\ncomplicated manner in a globalised world.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As a small city-state plugged into the\r\n\r\ninternational  grid, Singapore cannot be insulated  from  the\r\n\r\nkey global trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  conduct of Singapore's foreign policy has become an even\r\n\r\ngreater challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Foreign Policy Issues For Singapore's Future</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Southeast Asia remains in a state of flux following\r\n\r\nthe  Asian Financial Crisis.  Some countries continue to face\r\n\r\ndaunting  political  and  economic  challenges  domestically.\r\n\r\nThese  difficulties  have also provided  fertile  ground  for\r\n\r\nterrorism  and  religious extremism to  take  root,  fuelling\r\n\r\nethnic conflicts and separatist movements. How countries such\r\n\r\nas  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and the  Philippines  handle  these\r\n\r\nproblems will impact the overall security complexion  of  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Singapore's future is inextricably tied to\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  Managing  bilateral  relations   with   our\r\n\r\nneighbours, especially Malaysia and Indonesia, will remain  a\r\n\r\ntop  priority. Occasional hiccups in our relations  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours are inevitable.  But we will continue  to  take  a\r\n\r\nbroad  and long-term perspective of these relations, and  not\r\n\r\nbe  side-tracked  by differences over individual  issues.  We\r\n\r\nwant stable and mutually-beneficial relations.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. At the same time, Singapore remains firmly\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  ASEAN.   The perceptions of  Southeast  Asia's\r\n\r\npolitical and economic drift, in contrast to Northeast Asia's\r\n\r\ndynamism, cannot be brushed aside. ASEAN must reinvent itself\r\n\r\nand  keep pace with global changes. It needs to forge greater\r\n\r\ninternal  cohesion  and rediscover a new direction.  We  will\r\n\r\nwork  closely with our ASEAN neighbours and Dialogue partners\r\n\r\nthrough  the Initiative for ASEAN Integration and the Roadmap\r\n\r\nfor the Integration of ASEAN to integrate the newer and older\r\n\r\nmembers  and  ensure that the region remains outward-looking.\r\n\r\nWe will try, within our limits, to help restore stability and\r\n\r\nconfidence in the region.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Beyond the region, the global anti-terrorism effort\r\n\r\ncontinues. Singapore is an open society, totally dependent on\r\n\r\nthe   globalised   economy   and  an   orderly,   predictable\r\n\r\ninternational environment for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  and a living.  Terrorism which strikes at this  global\r\n\r\nsystem  directly undermines our prosperity and security.   We\r\n\r\nmust  take  a  clear stand and contribute  our  part  to  the\r\n\r\ninternational effort against terrorism.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The on-going anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan\r\n\r\nhas also demonstrated the US' unmatched military superiority,\r\n\r\nin  addition to its dominance in the economic, political  and\r\n\r\ntechnological  fields. How the US wields this influence  will\r\n\r\nhave profound implications for international stability.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Fortunately, the campaign against terrorism has\r\n\r\nimpelled   the   major  powers  to  emphasise  their   common\r\n\r\ninterests.  It  has stabilised the US-China-Japan  triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship,  which  is  crucial  to  Southeast  Asia.   But\r\n\r\nuncertainties remain. China's growth will change the  balance\r\n\r\nof  influence and power in the region.  Its integration  into\r\n\r\nthe   international  system  will  require  adjustments   and\r\n\r\naccommodation on both sides. We will continue to  engage  the\r\n\r\nUS   to  ensure  that  it  stays  in  the  region.   We  will\r\n\r\nconsolidate  cross-regional links  and  mutual  understanding\r\n\r\nwith Europe, particularly through ASEM.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will also continue to support international\r\n\r\norganisations, particularly the United Nations.   As  a  non-permanent  member  of  the United Nations  Security  Council,\r\n\r\nSingapore has supported initiatives that strengthen its  role\r\n\r\nas  the primary UN organ for maintaining international  peace\r\n\r\nand    security.   In   particular,   we   have   contributed\r\n\r\nconstructively   to   the  Council's  efforts   in   building\r\n\r\ninternational support for the campaign against terrorism.  We\r\n\r\nwill continue to be a constructive player in the UN.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Singapore Cooperation Programme remains an\r\n\r\nimportant  channel for Singapore to fulfil its  international\r\n\r\nobligations  by  sharing  our  development  experience   with\r\n\r\nothers.  Within  our limited resources,  we  will  strive  to\r\n\r\nmaximise our reach and accommodate the changing needs of  the\r\n\r\nrecipient countries by seeking collaboration and partnerships\r\n\r\nwith international organisations and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">DR TONY TAN KENG YAM</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Defence</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

The Ministry of Law (MinLaw)'s focus will be to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) strengthen our legal infrastructure and expand the legal services sector;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) formulate a comprehensive legal and policy framework for Intellectual Property (IP) and develop Singapore as a centre for IP; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) optimise our land resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Legal Services</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MinLaw will work closely with the Attorney-General's Chambers, Academy of Law, Law Society and NUS Law\r\n\r\nFaculty  to  accelerate the growth of the  legal  sector  and\r\n\r\nupgrade our legal talent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npool. Our lawyers must keep up to date on emerging areas such\r\n\r\nas   info-communications  technology  (ICT),   biotechnology,\r\n\r\nintellectual property (IP) and international trade laws,  and\r\n\r\ncontinually  upgrade their expertise in  key  areas  such  as\r\n\r\ncorporate finance, banking, aviation and shipping laws.  This\r\n\r\nwill  support our strategies to make Singapore a hub for high\r\n\r\nvalue-added activities such as ICT and financial services.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will also develop international arbitration and\r\n\r\nmediation into a thriving service cluster together  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  International Arbitration Centre  (SIAC)  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Mediation  Centre  (SMC).   MinLaw  will   further\r\n\r\npromote  community mediation as a means of  resolving  social\r\n\r\nand  relational  disputes.  We will work with  the  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Councils to create greater public  awareness  of\r\n\r\ncommunity  mediation.   We will also raise  the  professional\r\n\r\nstandards    of   our   mediators   through   training    and\r\n\r\naccreditation, and promote other forms of mediation  such  as\r\n\r\npeer mediation in schools and pre-bankruptcy mediation.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Beyond these domestic initiatives, MinLaw will\r\n\r\nenhance  our  training infrastructure  to  enable  the  legal\r\n\r\nfraternity to share their legal knowledge with lawyers in the\r\n\r\nregion  and promote the harmonisation of trade and commercial\r\n\r\nlaws  within ASEAN and the region.  We will also explore  how\r\n\r\nwe can promote legal services as an export industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Intellectual Property</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MinLaw and the Intellectual Property Office of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (IPOS) will work with the Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  and  other economic agencies  to  put  in  place  a\r\n\r\nlegislative and policy framework to develop Singapore  as  an\r\n\r\nIP  hub, attractive for companies, IP professionals and other\r\n\r\nindividuals to congregate, create and exploit IP. MinLaw will\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on Singapore's excellent legal infrastructure  to\r\n\r\nposition  ourselves  as  an  international  arbitration   and\r\n\r\nmediation centre for IP dispute resolution.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To achieve this, quality IP-related manpower is\r\n\r\ncritical.  MinLaw will set up an IP Academy for the  training\r\n\r\nof  IP-related skills, to increase the sophistication of  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in IP management and to complement  the  academic\r\n\r\ncurriculum in the Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Branch</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. MinLaw and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will\r\n\r\nreview our land policies, including lease expiry and renewal,\r\n\r\nlease upgrading and the land charging and pricing policy,  in\r\n\r\norder to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noptimise and intensify land use, promote the orderly  renewal\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's physical landscape and support  the  national\r\n\r\neconomic restructuring effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will also review regulations and practices to\r\n\r\nensure   effective  management  of  state  land.    We   will\r\n\r\nstreamline  our  land acquisition practices  so  that  public\r\n\r\nprojects  can  be  carried  out smoothly.   Land  legislation\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Land Titles (Strata) Act and the  Residential\r\n\r\nProperty  Act will also be reviewed to meet new and  evolving\r\n\r\nneeds  and  improve the management of strata  development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
