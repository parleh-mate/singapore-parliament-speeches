Surely advertisements  of  this\r\n\r\nnature could have been done away with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the press some advertisements with\r\n\r\ndubious claims are still being published. Often the\r\n\r\nvictims  are  women.  For  example,  there  is   an\r\n\r\nadvertisement  that  claims to  reduce  a  person's\r\n\r\nweight  in  minutes. The people who answered  these\r\n\r\nadvertisements   claimed  that   they   have   been\r\n\r\nswindled,  as  the services provided  were  not  in\r\n\r\naccord  with  what  these  advertisements  claimed.\r\n\r\nAgain,  there was another advertisement  showing  a\r\n\r\nquack  doctor  recommending  a  certain  drug   for\r\n\r\ncertain   cures.   This  is  mere  propaganda.   An\r\n\r\nadvertisement of this nature is misleading and  the\r\n\r\nadvertiser  is only interested in swindling  people\r\n\r\nof their honest earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, the vote on this\r\n\r\nsubhead  is  to be allocated for the  Head  of  the\r\n\r\nPublicity Division. The Publicity Division  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture has no  control  over  TV  or\r\n\r\nnewspaper  advertisements.  However,  as  for   the\r\n\r\nadvertisements  on TV, the Broadcasting  Department\r\n\r\nsees  to  it that every TV commercial submitted  to\r\n\r\nthe Department for use is subjected to two separate\r\n\r\ncensorship   viewings,  first,  by  the  Commercial\r\n\r\nDivision  and, second, by a panel of viewers  under\r\n\r\nthe  charge  of the film organiser. In  both  these\r\n\r\nareas,  strict control is exercised to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  content  of  the commercial,  both  radio  and\r\n\r\nvisual, adheres strictly to RTS programme code  and\r\n\r\ncopy policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many commercials depicting persons with long hair\r\n\r\nhave been rejected, although these entail a loss of\r\n\r\nrevenue.  From January 1973 to date, the Department\r\n\r\nhas  rejected  29  filmlets  on  this  ground.  The\r\n\r\ncorresponding figure in respect of slides is  four.\r\n\r\nMy officials in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Broadcasting Department are unable  to  recall\r\n\r\nany   commercial  showing  youths  with  long  hair\r\n\r\nromping  round  extolling the virtues  of  a  cough\r\n\r\nmixture.  Such  a commercial would  not  have  been\r\n\r\nallowed for telecast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the content of advertisements inserted in\r\n\r\nthe press, my Ministry does not censor them. If the\r\n\r\npublic  is  cheated by dishonest advertisements,  I\r\n\r\nthink the matter should more appropriately be dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by  the  Police, and reports  made  to  them.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if my Ministry finds that any  particular\r\n\r\nadvertisement   appearing  in  the  newspapers   is\r\n\r\nmorally objectionable, my Ministry will advise  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper   concerned   to   stop   carrying   such\r\n\r\nadvertisements further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the control of advertisements relating to\r\n\r\nmedical matters, this function is also outside  the\r\n\r\npurview  of my Ministry. Such matters are  governed\r\n\r\nby the Medicines (Advertisement and Sale) Act which\r\n\r\nis  administered  by the Ministry  of  Health.  For\r\n\r\nadvertisements over TV in which medical claims  are\r\n\r\nmade  in  respect of certain drugs and  cures,  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department insists on  some  form  of\r\n\r\nsupporting evidence or material. For example, if  a\r\n\r\nclaim  is made in a commercial that a certain  drug\r\n\r\nis  recommended by doctors, then the Department  of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting    requires    the    advertiser    to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  that such recommendations  have  been\r\n\r\nactually  made by doctors. If there  is  any  doubt\r\n\r\nregarding  such  claims,  then  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting will refer the matter to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Right  or\r\n\r\nwrong,   it  must  be  referred  to  the   Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned before approval is given. Now, is not the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department  under  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCulture?   Therefore,  the  Ministry  should   take\r\n\r\naction.  But  he  has said that this  matter  comes\r\n\r\nunder    Broadcasting.   Broadcasting    -    which\r\n\r\ndepartment, which Ministry? Ministry of Culture, is\r\n\r\nit not?

I thought I have made  that  clear.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  if  anybody or  any  reader  has  been\r\n\r\ncheated  through newspaper advertisements,  he  can\r\n\r\nmake  a  report to the Police. And following  that,\r\n\r\nthe  Police will have to take action. We  have  the\r\n\r\nFilm  Censorship Board, which has the control  over\r\n\r\nadvertisements on films, but it has no control over\r\n\r\nadvertisements in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> That is an unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nreply. The Broadcasting Department comes under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture.  Why  is  he  referring   to\r\n\r\nBroadcasting?  His  Ministry  is  the   responsible\r\n\r\nMinistry  to take any action. But why  did  he  say\r\n\r\nthat   the  Publicity  Division  does  not  control\r\n\r\nBroadcasting but the Minister for Culture  controls\r\n\r\nthe  Broadcasting Department? I am very  sorry  for\r\n\r\nthis barrage of questions. However, I beg leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 1107*.\r\n\r\n(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, inflation which is prevailing\r\n\r\nnow  throughout the world, including Singapore,  is\r\n\r\ncausing prices to rise, and rise still higher  from\r\n\r\nday  to day. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate\r\n\r\nfor the Minister for Culture to spend $10.2 million\r\n\r\nto  implement the plan for colour TV in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe sum to be allocated can be better used by other\r\n\r\nMinistries for projects that are more beneficial to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, workers in the low-income group are still\r\n\r\nhoping   for   a  sympathetic  gesture   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment by giving them a higher salary, so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can meet the rising cost of living, as prices\r\n\r\nare  very  high now. Therefore, it would be  better\r\n\r\nfor  the  sum  of  $10.2 million to  be  channelled\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  so that people in the low-income  group\r\n\r\ncan  get  more. The Minister himself and the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister have suggested to the people not to  spend\r\n\r\nmoney  unnecessarily.  But  when  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture implements TV programmes in colour,  people\r\n\r\nwill  buy  colour  television  sets.  Although  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  does not encourage people to  buy  colour\r\n\r\nsets, nevertheless the people will be inclined  and\r\n\r\ninfluenced  into buying colour sets  on  instalment\r\n\r\nbasis. And by paying in instalments, the price\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  definitely be higher, and this  will  further\r\n\r\naffect  their  cost  of  living,  making  it   more\r\n\r\ndifficult for them. Therefore, I think it would  be\r\n\r\nbetter for the Ministry of Culture to postpone  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of colour television to next  year  or\r\n\r\nto  some other appropriate time, when inflation has\r\n\r\nsubsided  and when economic conditions in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the standard of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting is quite poor. Some of the  announcers\r\n\r\nswallow  their words. I believe the reason is  that\r\n\r\nbroadcasters   are   chosen   from   their    paper\r\n\r\nqualifications   rather  than  their   broadcasting\r\n\r\nabilities.  This should not be the  case.  Language\r\n\r\nproficiency is very important. It does not  take  a\r\n\r\nvery  highly  qualified person  to  be  announcers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I suggest that fluency and  proficiency\r\n\r\nin  the  language medium should be considered  when\r\n\r\nselecting  candidates for the post.  If  not,  they\r\n\r\nshould be sent for training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the standard of locally produced\r\n\r\nprogrammes so poor? Is it because our producers are\r\n\r\nnot  properly  trained? Most of our programmes  are\r\n\r\nimported  since  we  lack  expertise  in  producing\r\n\r\nscripts. Why we do not get foreign experts to train\r\n\r\nour people? I also heard that the payments made  to\r\n\r\nthe  artistes are very low, but if foreigners come,\r\n\r\nthey  pay more money. If an artiste is to sing just\r\n\r\na  song  over  TV, he or she has to  go  through  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  auditions, before the  final  scene  is\r\n\r\nshot.  Surely something could be done  about  this.\r\n\r\nAfter all the fuss, the artiste is paid a miserable\r\n\r\nmite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that the same faces appear again and\r\n\r\nagain  on  our local TV programmes? We  cannot  get\r\n\r\nother  persons  -only those persons!  Something  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely wrong somewhere. What efforts are  being\r\n\r\nmade to introduce new blood of screen artistes?  Is\r\n\r\nthere  a  clique system in the auditioning section?\r\n\r\nProbably the system of auditioning artistes has  to\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed to give more people a chance  to  come\r\n\r\nforward to participate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the programmes in the English Section are\r\n\r\nimported  ones.  Even the plays  are  BBC-produced.\r\n\r\nSurely with a large English-speaking population  we\r\n\r\nshould  be able to produce some plays over  TV  and\r\n\r\nRadio. There are some local theatrical groups whose\r\n\r\nperformances  are good. Why not televise  them  and\r\n\r\nthereby  encourage  them? How  successful  has  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department been in attracting  people\r\n\r\nto contribute songs and drama with local colour, or\r\n\r\nhave the miserable prizes it offers not brought  in\r\n\r\nany contributions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, one could view TV documentaries\r\n\r\nquite  often. Documentaries, as one knows,  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  great educational value and for Singapore  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  where the population is  young,  these\r\n\r\ndocumentaries  will enhance the  concepts  of  this\r\n\r\nworld. It is time RTS introduced more documentaries\r\n\r\nrather  than  pop singers who were  idols  sometime\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Budget session, I pointed out\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  pronunciation of the word \"million\"  by\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil announcers. The Tamil language  is  very\r\n\r\nold.  But the Tamil announcers do not seem to  know\r\n\r\nthe  word \"million\" in Tamil. They use the  English\r\n\r\nword  \"million\". Last year, I mentioned about  this\r\n\r\nand I told them not to use \"million\". If they speak\r\n\r\nTamil,  use purely the Tamil words. Why  must  they\r\n\r\nmix English and Tamil together? If there is no such\r\n\r\nword  in the Tamil language, then there is no harm.\r\n\r\nBut  there is a word for \"million\" in Tamil. Up to-date no effort has been made to rectify this error.\r\n\r\nWhy  is this so? When a Member of Parliament shouts\r\n\r\nout  his  complaints here, is that the end  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter, closed up and finished? If so, what is  the\r\n\r\nuse of talking, talking, and talking again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsentiments  expressed  by the  Member  for  Kampung\r\n\r\nKembangan.  However,  I am  most  concerned  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether it is most appropriate to introduce  colour\r\n\r\ntelevision at the present time. I believe there are\r\n\r\napproximately 250,000 black and white  TV  sets  in\r\n\r\nuse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  the moment. With the introduction of colour TV,\r\n\r\nit  is  expected that a large number of people,  as\r\n\r\nhas  been  pointed out earlier on,  would  want  to\r\n\r\nswitch  from black and white to colour  TV  I  have\r\n\r\nmade  a very quick calculation. Assuming that  only\r\n\r\n25  per  cent of the people want colour television,\r\n\r\nit  would mean a total expenditure of approximately\r\n\r\n$62  million, based on $1,000 per set which is  the\r\n\r\nfigure given to me by the Minister for Culture.  If\r\n\r\neverybody wants to change over to colour, the total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  would come to $250  million.  As  most\r\n\r\ntelevision sets are imported, or even if  they  are\r\n\r\nassembled here, most of the parts would still  have\r\n\r\nto  come from abroad, and the total spending of the\r\n\r\npublic  would be a drain on our hard-earned foreign\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out earlier on, while we are\r\n\r\nurging  people  on  the one hand to  tighten  their\r\n\r\nbelts  and  to  cut down on personal  spending  and\r\n\r\nsave,  on the other hand, it would appear  that  we\r\n\r\nare  acting  against  our own  policy.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nglaring   example   of  the  occasional   lack   of\r\n\r\nconsistency  in  the implementation  of  Government\r\n\r\npolicies, suggesting that the left hand often  does\r\n\r\nnot  know  what the right hand is doing. Government\r\n\r\ndepartments are not the only guilty parties in this\r\n\r\nrespect. State-owned enterprises are much worse.  I\r\n\r\nam sure Members' attention has been drawn in recent\r\n\r\nweeks  to huge advertising spaces taken up  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines enticing people to  take  their\r\n\r\nholidays abroad. This is at a time when the  nation\r\n\r\nis  faced  with  an  extra oil deal  of  some  $200\r\n\r\nmillion,  as  pointed  out  by  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance.  Every effort should be made  to  conserve\r\n\r\nour  hard-earned foreign exchange, rather  than  to\r\n\r\nsquander it away on non-essentials which would only\r\n\r\naffect our balance of payments position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Somehow or other, knowing our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Minister for Culture, I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  they  are thinking of  increasing  the\r\n\r\nrates for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTV  licences.

At  the  present moment, colour TV  does  not\r\n\r\ncover  the  whole spectrum. Many countries  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, like Japan and the United States of America,\r\n\r\nare going to step up development to have colour  TV\r\n\r\nthat  would  cover the whole spectrum.  This  would\r\n\r\nmost  certainly  be  an advantage  because  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment  colours  in  real  life  are   not\r\n\r\nfaithfully reproduced on colour TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlast   year   when   we   were  discussing   colour\r\n\r\ntelevision,  there was an overwhelming  demand  for\r\n\r\ncolour  television.

In Singapore, whether it is this year,  next\r\n\r\nyear  or ten years later, we must keep up with  the\r\n\r\ntimes. We must have colour television. It is better\r\n\r\nto  have it now, because if a colour television set\r\n\r\ncosts  $1,000 today I think it would probably  cost\r\n\r\n$1,500 in two years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> It may be in six months' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Or in six months' time, and\r\n\r\nthis  would  be  a  further drain  on  our  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  as we have to pay more for the import  of\r\n\r\ncolour  TV  sets.  I think colour television  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  form of entertainment. It is  much  more\r\n\r\nattractive than black and white. It is one  way  of\r\n\r\nkeeping  the people at home so that they would  not\r\n\r\nwaste  their  money  seeking entertainment  outside\r\n\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ntouching  on the topic of colour television,  I  am\r\n\r\namazed by the rather spontaneous reactions that  we\r\n\r\nhear  today  in Parliament against the introduction\r\n\r\nof  colour television. As the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed out, last year there was unanimous\r\n\r\napplause  for the introduction of colour television\r\n\r\nand this year a sudden reverse reaction,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitate really to say that we should proceed\r\n\r\nwith  colour television because, to my mind,  there\r\n\r\nmust  surely  be  very  good  reasons  behind   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture's intention to introduce colour\r\n\r\ntelevision.  But we are faced with the  problem  of\r\n\r\ninternational inflation and the rise in oil prices,\r\n\r\nand  this should certainly be a new factor  in  our\r\n\r\nfinancial calculations. I therefore do not wish  to\r\n\r\ngoad  the  Minister  for  Culture  head-on  to  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  colour television.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, I think it is appropriate for the Ministry to\r\n\r\nsit  down  and have a serious calculation,  working\r\n\r\nforwards and backwards, to find out if in  fact  we\r\n\r\nshould proceed with colour television. And if it is\r\n\r\nconvinced that it is necessary then we carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has correctly pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  introducing colour television in  two  years'\r\n\r\ntime might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  a  lot  more  money. We can foresee  that  if\r\n\r\ncolour television were not introduced by that time,\r\n\r\nsome Backbenchers or some Members on the Government\r\n\r\nside  might come up and say, \"Look, two  years  ago\r\n\r\nyou were against it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think I ought to clarify\r\n\r\nmyself.  When I spoke against colour television,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  against having colour television as  such,\r\n\r\nbut  it is a question of timing. Take our financial\r\n\r\npolicy,  for  instance.  Last  year  we  encouraged\r\n\r\npeople  to spend because times were good.  But  now\r\n\r\nbecause of inflation and other factors, as part and\r\n\r\nparcel of our anti-inflation measures, the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore and the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nhave  introduced a whole series of  credit  squeeze\r\n\r\nmeasures. As we all know, the credit squeeze is on.\r\n\r\nI  am  not saying that we must not have colour  TV.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that there was a demand last year and now\r\n\r\nwe  are  suggesting that there should be a  changed\r\n\r\nattitude  is totally immaterial to the point  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying  to make, i.e, the consistency of Government\r\n\r\npolicy.  The policy and the implementation  thereof\r\n\r\nshould be consistent. That is the main point  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to emphasise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before\r\n\r\nanswering  the  Member  for Kampung  Kembangan  and\r\n\r\nother   Members   who  have  suggested   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment delay the introduction of colour  TV  in\r\n\r\nview of the present inflation and high prices which\r\n\r\nmay  cause  a social burden to our people,  let  me\r\n\r\nanswer  the  question by the Member  for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nfirst,  as  the Deputy Speaker had ruled  yesterday\r\n\r\nthat   the  Member's  question  could  be  answered\r\n\r\ntogether  with the others in respect of subhead  CA\r\n\r\n1107, for which there is an amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang had asked my Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday when colour TV would be ready. And before\r\n\r\nI  could give an answer, some Members had also,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  dwelt  on the subject.

Film programmes from  overseas  and\r\n\r\nlocal  documentary  films  will  be  scheduled  for\r\n\r\ntelecast    on   both   channels   during    normal\r\n\r\ntransmission  hours. The number of such  programmes\r\n\r\nin  colour will be limited to a duration of one  to\r\n\r\ntwo hours a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment orders for studio and outside broadcast\r\n\r\nproductions  have  already  been  placed,  and   an\r\n\r\nextension  to  the pilot service will  be  effected\r\n\r\nwhen these equipment are delivered and installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, coming back to the\r\n\r\nsuggestion by the Member for Kampung Kembangan  and\r\n\r\nalso  other  Members  that  Government  delay   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of colour TV, which Members have  also\r\n\r\nexpressed concern, may I be allowed, Sir, to inform\r\n\r\nMembers  that  we  cannot accede to  their  request\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  Members will recollect,  in  January,\r\n\r\n1972,  Government  approved  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\ncolour TV. The whole project costs over $20 million\r\n\r\nover  a  period  of  four  years.  This  House  has\r\n\r\naccordingly  voted $2.9 million last year  for  the\r\n\r\nproject. Since then, a number of tenders have  been\r\n\r\ncalled for the purchase of equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present black and white television service\r\n\r\nwas  inaugurated in February, 1963. This means that\r\n\r\nmost of the equipment at our TV station is over  10\r\n\r\nyears  old, and is due for replacement due to usage\r\n\r\nand  fair  wear  and tear It would,  therefore,  be\r\n\r\neconomically sound at this stage when replacing the\r\n\r\nequipment to introduce colour television. Moreover,\r\n\r\nif we were to defer this project, Singapore will be\r\n\r\namongst  the last of the South-east Asian countries\r\n\r\nto further develop its television service. Thailand\r\n\r\nand the Philippines introduced colour television  a\r\n\r\ncouple of years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to abandon the project at this\r\n\r\njuncture, it would also mean that we would  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to fully utilise some of the equipment  which\r\n\r\nwe  ordered  and  which  was delivered  before  the\r\n\r\nenergy  crisis. In this respect, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nthank  the  Members for Kim Seng,  Bras  Basah  and\r\n\r\nMoulmein  who have expressed their support  on  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of colour TV. We do not know when  the\r\n\r\nenergy  crisis  will  be over,  although  the  Arab\r\n\r\ncountries  have already lifted the oil  embargo  to\r\n\r\nthe  United  States. And if we  were  to  introduce\r\n\r\ncolour  TV three or four years later, then  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  to pay a very much higher price. By that time\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of equipment would have gone up  and  we\r\n\r\nwould have to pay more for what we are getting now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we introduce colour TV later this year, we\r\n\r\nwill  telecast  only overseas film  programmes  and\r\n\r\nsome  local documentary films in colour  for  about\r\n\r\none  to  two hours daily. Local studio and  outside\r\n\r\nbroadcast  productions in colour will  he  telecast\r\n\r\nnext  year  when the necessary equipment have  been\r\n\r\ndelivered and installed. The plan, in other  words,\r\n\r\nis  to  \"inject\" colour programmes into the  normal\r\n\r\nservice on Channels 5 and 8 in planned stages. This\r\n\r\nis  because the technical facilities both at our TV\r\n\r\nStudio Centre and Transmitting Station are required\r\n\r\nfor  use daily whilst new colour equipment is being\r\n\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV viewers would still be able to watch colour\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on  their  black  and  white  receivers\r\n\r\nthough  the  pictures will be in black  and  white.\r\n\r\nThey,  therefore,  need not involve  themselves  in\r\n\r\nextra  expenditure in obtaining colour sets. It  is\r\n\r\nalso my Ministry's intention to advise the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  install  colour  TV  sets  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres so that the public at large  can,\r\n\r\nif they wish, view colour programmes in colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. He says that the broadcasting programme\r\n\r\nis  poor  and also that too much emphasis has  been\r\n\r\nplaced on paper qualification and not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   talent.  A  minimum  standard  of  educational\r\n\r\nqualification  has  to be set  in  any  recruitment\r\n\r\nexercise.  In the case of announcers,  the  minimum\r\n\r\nqualification  is  a  School  Certificate  or   its\r\n\r\nequivalent.  An  announcer does not only  announce.\r\n\r\nHis   other   duties   include   the   writing   of\r\n\r\nannouncements for music programmes and compiling of\r\n\r\nrecords  or of programmes produced in our  studios.\r\n\r\nHe  also  has  to draft the programme summaries  at\r\n\r\nleast  twice in a day's transmission. He is  called\r\n\r\nupon  to  draft  emergency announcements  as  well.\r\n\r\nDepending  on  his versatility, an  announcer  also\r\n\r\ninterviews,  reads  the news and  comperes  variety\r\n\r\nshows. Versatility, it might be stated here,  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  necessary quality in RTS. In any  recruitment\r\n\r\nexercise  for announcers, a voice test is  set  for\r\n\r\nall who have applied and who have the minimum paper\r\n\r\nqualification. The voice test consists  of  reading\r\n\r\nsimple  announcements for music programmes,  public\r\n\r\nservice announcements, commercials and a short news\r\n\r\nbulletin.  Language  fluency  and  proficiency  are\r\n\r\nessentials for the passing of the voice test.  Only\r\n\r\nthose  who pass the voice test are invited  to  sit\r\n\r\nfor  a  written test. The written test consists  of\r\n\r\nquestions  on  basic  general  knowledge,   current\r\n\r\naffairs,  art  and  culture, and  the  drafting  of\r\n\r\nsimple  announcements  in view  of  the  duties  of\r\n\r\nannouncers which I have just outlined. Persons with\r\n\r\nthe potentialities of a good announcer are not easy\r\n\r\nto  find.  For  instance, in the  last  recruitment\r\n\r\nexercise  held in April last year for  the  English\r\n\r\nand  the  Chinese streams, the number of applicants\r\n\r\nwas  278 for English and 479 for Chinese. Only five\r\n\r\napplicants from the 278 and three from the 479 were\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  suitable. Out of the  five  for  the\r\n\r\nEnglish stream, only two eventually joined RTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the standard of locally-produced\r\n\r\nprogrammes, it depends not only on the  calibre  of\r\n\r\nproducers  but  also on the budget  allowed  for  a\r\n\r\nproduction and on the talents that one can be found\r\n\r\nfor   production.  Within  these  limitations,  RTS\r\n\r\nproducers  have  to  do  their  best  by   way   of\r\n\r\npresentation and production. All producers who join\r\n\r\nRTS  are  given in-service training. Until recently\r\n\r\nRTS had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  BBC  consultants to train its staff,  one  for\r\n\r\nradio and another for TV programmes. Their services\r\n\r\nwere   made  possible  through  the  Colombo   Plan\r\n\r\nTechnical  Assistance Scheme. Training  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen in-service or on-the-job and the trainers  are\r\n\r\nsenior staff members who have to perform many other\r\n\r\nduties  as well. Within these limitations, however,\r\n\r\nRTS does its best to provide training opportunities\r\n\r\nfor its staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the question on the\r\n\r\npayment of fees to artistes. The very fact that  an\r\n\r\nartiste has, first of all, to be auditioned and  to\r\n\r\nturn  up  for at least one rehearsal in the studio,\r\n\r\napart  from a pre-recording session in the case  of\r\n\r\nsome  variety shows and finally to be  present  for\r\n\r\nrecording the programme, is an indication that  RTS\r\n\r\nproducers do their best to be professional in their\r\n\r\nproductions. Any station in the world which sets  a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard for itself regards these tests as  a\r\n\r\nnecessary part of production and not a fuss. If the\r\n\r\nfee  is deemed miserable, it is another issue.  RTS\r\n\r\ncan  only  pay  the  fee that is stipulated  in  an\r\n\r\napproved schedule of fees and can only spend within\r\n\r\nthe budget that it is given. It is a fact that very\r\n\r\noften it has to make the coat smaller than it  need\r\n\r\nbe  because of the size of the cloth. Talents of  a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  are  still  relatively  limited  in\r\n\r\nnumber in Singapore, but no one is barred from  any\r\n\r\naudition.  Even when there are no such contests  as\r\n\r\ntalentime,  RTS welcomes anyone who  feels  he  has\r\n\r\nsome  talent,  in  terms  of  contributing  to  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes, to write in for an audition whether  it\r\n\r\nbe  for  variety  shows,  dramas,  comic  sketches,\r\n\r\nmagazine items, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that most of the radio\r\n\r\nprogrammes are imported ones. To say that  most  of\r\n\r\nthe   programmes  being  broadcast  on  radio   are\r\n\r\nimported is not true. The overwhelming majority are\r\n\r\nin  fact  produced by our own staff locally.  These\r\n\r\ncomprise  magazine programmes of various types  for\r\n\r\nyouths,   workers,   women,  sports   and   musical\r\n\r\nprogrammes of every description. Feature programmes\r\n\r\nare  also  produced locally. It is  true,  however,\r\n\r\nthat the plays broadcast in the English service are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmainly BBC-produced because they have proved to  be\r\n\r\namong  the  best  available. RTS has  attempted  to\r\n\r\nproduce  local plays in English but they  have  not\r\n\r\nproved  successful. Two drama writing  competitions\r\n\r\nhave been held but a good number of the scripts  of\r\n\r\nplays received had stories similar to those already\r\n\r\nseen  on TV. English-speaking stage groups are very\r\n\r\nfew  in number and when they stage plays, these are\r\n\r\noverwhelmingly plays and not locally written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also raised a question on\r\n\r\nthe  use of the word \"million\" by Tamil announcers.\r\n\r\nThe  use  of  the  word \"million\"  was  adopted  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1972 after consultation with the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education's  Research and Statistics  Division.\r\n\r\nThe  Tamil phrase for \"one million\" previously used\r\n\r\nwas  pathu  lak sham. This is, however, not  easily\r\n\r\ncomprehended by the younger generation  as  in  the\r\n\r\nTamil   schools  in  Singapore,  where   the   word\r\n\r\n\"million\" is now extensively used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

This\r\n\r\npoint  was  also mentioned by the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah. If I am not mistaken, Sir, a few years ago\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber, the Prime Minister said that  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number of cars, motorcycles  and\r\n\r\nscooters registered from month to month is  related\r\n\r\nto  the economic progress of Singapore. But in  the\r\n\r\nlast few days, we have been debating on the problem\r\n\r\nof   reducing  the  number  of  private   cars   by\r\n\r\nincreasing taxes and the prices of petrol.

When  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  gave  his  explanation  to  the   points\r\n\r\nraised, he gave me the impression that one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  reasons that influenced us to go into  colour\r\n\r\nTV is to keep up with the Joneses. I certainly hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  our consideration of Government  service,\r\n\r\nthis  is not the attitude and we do not go in  just\r\n\r\nbecause we want to be one up on the others.  If  we\r\n\r\ngo  in  to extend our service, it should be on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of:  is there a need? Is there  a  need  for\r\n\r\ncolour `I'V for our people? It is not a question of\r\n\r\njust  because  Philippines and  Thailand  have  got\r\n\r\ncolour  TV, then we must have it. I certainly  hope\r\n\r\nthat this is not the main reason. The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary gave me the impression that that  is  the\r\n\r\nmain reason why we are going into colour TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not think this is a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  just keeping up with the Joneses.  We\r\n\r\nare  keeping  up  with  time. As  my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary has already mentioned just now,  most  of\r\n\r\nour  equipment  has been in use for  the  last  ten\r\n\r\nyears.  It  is  time for us to change,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  we change it because the new equipment  can\r\n\r\nbe  used either for colour or black and white. That\r\n\r\nis  one of the main factors which prompted us to go\r\n\r\ninto  colour  TV. And it would be cheaper  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture to introduce colour because, in any  case,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the films and the tapes that we  purchase\r\n\r\nand  hire  from overseas are already in colour.

The  cinema  halls  are\r\n\r\nalways  packed  to capacity. This is an  indication\r\n\r\nthat  our people like to see film shows. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe content of film\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshows  do have a great impact and influence on  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Over the past few years the films screened\r\n\r\nin our cinema halls were of questionable character.\r\n\r\nWe  all know that most of the films screened in the\r\n\r\ncinema halls are shows of violence, sex and of  low\r\n\r\ntaste. Good film shows are few and far between. The\r\n\r\ncontent  of the shows is more or less the same.  We\r\n\r\ntake, for example, the films on violence. There  is\r\n\r\nviolent action from beginning to end, until all the\r\n\r\ncharacters are dead. It is a story of killing,  and\r\n\r\nthat  has no educational value at all. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we  have the farcical shows which we  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  head or tail of them. In the case of film  on\r\n\r\nsex,  there  is nothing but sex. These  films  have\r\n\r\nundesirable   effects  on  the  young   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  especially  when  we  are  desirous  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a rugged and healthy society. It cannot be\r\n\r\ndoubted  that  we  all  need good  and  educational\r\n\r\nfilms.  The content of such films must be  able  to\r\n\r\ninspire people into good thinking. It must be  able\r\n\r\nto  encourage people to love labour and to  improve\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Such films must be able  to  inculcate\r\n\r\nthe  feeling of patriotism, national consciousness,\r\n\r\nand  how to conduct oneself as a man. These are the\r\n\r\nkinds  of  film  shows that  we  want  to  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to apply a\r\n\r\nmore stringent standard on film censorship. We must\r\n\r\nencourage  a  more  healthy type  of  films  to  be\r\n\r\nscreened  in Singapore to give our people a  better\r\n\r\nform of entertainment. The Minister may say that as\r\n\r\na  lot  of films are imported from overseas, it  is\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control, and that if a more  stringent\r\n\r\nstandard  is applied on such importation,  then  we\r\n\r\nwould have no film shows at all. I beg to differ on\r\n\r\nthis  count  because  it is the  business  of  film\r\n\r\nproducers to make money. If film producers overseas\r\n\r\ncan  understand  our  policy,  then  they  will  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to change their policy so that they will\r\n\r\nproduce  the kind of films that we want. Our  film-viewing  population consists of two million  people\r\n\r\nand this is a highly profitable market which should\r\n\r\nbe an attraction to overseas film producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I fully agree with the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang that films, such as films  on\r\n\r\nviolence, have a very strong influence on the young\r\n\r\npeople. The Government has, therefore, always taken\r\n\r\na  serious view of screening films on violence  and\r\n\r\nwe  have always been very strict in censoring  such\r\n\r\nfilms.  In  fact,  films that glorify  violence  or\r\n\r\nbrutality  are  not allowed for exhibition  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic and those that contain violent and  brutal\r\n\r\nscenes  are appropriately censored before they  are\r\n\r\npassed for public exhibition. We will not hestitate\r\n\r\nto  tighten our censorship on films on violence. In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  1973 we had to ban about 70  such  films\r\n\r\nwhich glorify violence and gangsterism, and most of\r\n\r\nthem were imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other category of films, I do not think\r\n\r\nwe can accept the Member for Sembawang's suggestion\r\n\r\nbecause if we were to allow only a certain type  of\r\n\r\nfilms  to  be shown and not others, then I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  will  have  any films  to  show  in  our\r\n\r\ncinemas.  In  any case I do not run a  cinema.  The\r\n\r\npeople in this business know what sort of films are\r\n\r\ngood box office draws, and therefore they know what\r\n\r\nto bring to make good money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to forcing film producers to change their\r\n\r\npolicy, I do not think that is possible. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang said that our potential audience  of\r\n\r\ntwo million people would be sufficient to make film-producing a very profitable venture. I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  it is that profitable because film companies,\r\n\r\nespecially those in Hollywood, will not make  films\r\n\r\njust for two million people in Singapore. They will\r\n\r\nmake  films  to suit a world-wide audience.  So  we\r\n\r\neither  have them or not at all.

The  amount  to be allocated  amounts  to\r\n\r\n$40,000. It is really an insignificant sum compared\r\n\r\nwith  $130,000 for the previous year.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndecrease  of  225  per cent. I  doubt  this  meagre\r\n\r\n$40,000  can meet the expenditure required for  the\r\n\r\n50-odd rural community centres. I am afraid  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough to buy one table-tennis table for  each\r\n\r\ncommunity centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of community centres is to create\r\n\r\nactivity  for the benefit of the community  in  the\r\n\r\nrespective localities. We should therefore  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with more funds so as to be able to give  the\r\n\r\npeople more guidance and activities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  conducting  more educational  classes  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  their needs. As we all know, the level  of\r\n\r\nincome  of  the  people  in  the  rural  areas   is\r\n\r\ngenerally  low. So we cannot expect much from  them\r\n\r\nby  way of giving financial help to the running  of\r\n\r\nrural   community  centres.  Therefore,  if   these\r\n\r\ncommunity centres cannot carry out more activities,\r\n\r\nthen  the  Minister  for  Finance  should  consider\r\n\r\ngiving more financial aid to assist them. I believe\r\n\r\nthe community centre in the Minister's constituency\r\n\r\nis  a suburban one. So he should agree with what  I\r\n\r\nam saying here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actual fact, the facilities in the rural\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres are dilapidated.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nthe  sewing machines are a decade old, and when  in\r\n\r\nuse the machines can be heard to grind and vibrate.\r\n\r\nThe  basket-ball courts are full of  pot-holes  and\r\n\r\nthe ground is so uneven that the players can easily\r\n\r\nhurt  themselves. In my constituency, the community\r\n\r\ncentre has applied for financial assistance for the\r\n\r\nlast  three  years. No reply has  been  given,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore no actual aid can be expected. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  blame  the  People's  Association.  The\r\n\r\nactual crux of the problem lies in the shortage  of\r\n\r\nfunds.  Even  a very skilful housewife cannot  cook\r\n\r\nwithout rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several kinds of classes, such as\r\n\r\nsewing  and  cooking, run by the community  centre.\r\n\r\nThese are very beneficial to rural womenfolk. These\r\n\r\nclasses  provide  them with the  necessary  skills.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  recent  years, the  number  of  these\r\n\r\nclasses has dwindled. Some have closed down. Why is\r\n\r\nthis  so?  It is not because instructors cannot  be\r\n\r\nrecruited.  It  is because the allowances  for  the\r\n\r\ninstructors  are too small, and they have  resigned\r\n\r\nto  seek  better  jobs. In these circumstances,  we\r\n\r\nmust adopt some measures to improve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  situation. I hope the Minister in charge  will\r\n\r\ngive  more funds to rural community centres so that\r\n\r\nthe  rural folks can get more benefit out of  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise a question about\r\n\r\ncultural  recreation  in my constituency.  Recently\r\n\r\nthere  was a cultural show full of rich items,  and\r\n\r\nit appreciated by the people. On this, I would like\r\n\r\nto  congratulate the Minister for having done  much\r\n\r\ntowards   the   motion   of  a   healthy   cultural\r\n\r\nrecreation. But there is also a shortage  of  funds\r\n\r\nto stage such cultural shows. Therefore, I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will pay attention to this matter and will\r\n\r\nnot   stop  promoting  such  meaningful  activities\r\n\r\nbecause of the shortage of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it is the Government's policy to house three-quarters  of  our population by the  lend  of  this\r\n\r\ndecade. Taking the population level at two million,\r\n\r\nthis  will  approximately  amount  to  1.5  million\r\n\r\npeople  being housed in Housing Board  flats.  This\r\n\r\nfact  has  affected certain sources and  they  have\r\n\r\nundertaken  studies into various kinds  of  effects\r\n\r\nthat  this  situation will produce. In  fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  this  kind of massive situation comes  about,\r\n\r\ni.e, three-quarters of our population are housed in\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats, I think it will have a bearing\r\n\r\non  our  social and economic position in the  years\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that when the populace live largely\r\n\r\nin houses with their backyard or compounds, whether\r\n\r\nbe   kampung  houses,  terrace,  semi-detached   or\r\n\r\ndetached houses, there be sufficient room space and\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  the youths to express  themselves\r\n\r\nthe  field  of  carpentry,  mechanics,  science  or\r\n\r\ntechnology,  which opportunity either  be  severely\r\n\r\ndiminished or to lost when our populace  reside  in\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats, which are high-rise buildings.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  also  feel that it is this kin  experience,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  youths  take in the backyards,  kampung\r\n\r\ncompounds,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  gardens of the semi-detached  or  detached\r\n\r\nhouses, that inculcates in our youth a capacity  to\r\n\r\nexperiment, to dabble in the elementary  principles\r\n\r\nof mechanics, carpentry, science or technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the schools, although\r\n\r\nequipped  with  such facilities, will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nextend this opportunity to our youths at the end of\r\n\r\nthis  decade when they are housed in Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats. The only opportunity that exists, or can  be\r\n\r\npossible  therefore, can be found in the  community\r\n\r\ncentres which are amply distributed throughout  our\r\n\r\nState, particularly those in Housing Board estates.\r\n\r\nI  feel that we should think ahead and consider the\r\n\r\nfeasibility  of  making it a deliberate  policy  to\r\n\r\nconstruct work rooms with work benches in community\r\n\r\ncentres,  which can accommodate such activities  of\r\n\r\nour youths in the years to come. Unless this talent\r\n\r\nis  nurtured and its loss prevented, our youth will\r\n\r\nbe  that much poorer in talent. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  be  prepared to cause studies to be  made  in\r\n\r\nthis  direction  and to assess its feasibility  and\r\n\r\npracticability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\ngratified to note that the community centres  under\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Association  have  intensified  the\r\n\r\nemphasis on how to mobilise and attract our  youths\r\n\r\nto  participate in the youth group activities. Sir,\r\n\r\nno  one  can  deny  that the success  of  a  nation\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the character and the quality  of  her\r\n\r\nyouth, because they constitute the next generation.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore our responsibility to guide them,\r\n\r\ntrain  and  help  them  to develop  as  leaders  of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are at present 66 Youth Sub-Committees\r\n\r\nunder  the  management committees  of  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunity centres in our Republic.

But, it is sad to note that there is  only\r\n\r\none  community  centre, that is, the  Changi  Point\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre that has such facilities, but they\r\n\r\nare very limited.

I  have  to\r\n\r\ndisappoint   him  again  this  year   because   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $130,000 in last year's  Budget  was\r\n\r\nactually intended for five rural community centres.\r\n\r\nBut  four  of these centres had to be abandoned  or\r\n\r\nthe  plans  shelved  as  a  result  of  development\r\n\r\nschemes  which  affect  the sites.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nprovision for this year has been reduced.  The  sum\r\n\r\nof  $40,000  to be provided this year  is  actually\r\n\r\nmeant  for only one community centre, which is  now\r\n\r\nunder  construction. He will note  that  the  major\r\n\r\nportions  of  the provision for the financial  year\r\n\r\n1974  is meant for upgrading of facilities  in  key\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  This  is  receiving   priority\r\n\r\nattention now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we need to have more activities\r\n\r\nin    community   centres   especially   vocational\r\n\r\nactivities. But I think the Member has actually pin-pointed  the  problem, and that  is,  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ninstructors. The People's Association is now paying\r\n\r\na very modest fee to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstructors,  and this is insufficient  to  attract\r\n\r\npeople  to come forward, especially for posting  to\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas, because many of these instructors\r\n\r\nprefer to be posted very near to their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultural shows provided by the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  will be continued and will  eventually\r\n\r\ngo  round to all the constituencies. Whether or not\r\n\r\nwe  have  the money and the funds to carry on  such\r\n\r\nactivities  is another matter. We will try  to  get\r\n\r\nenough  funds, whether they are to be  provided  by\r\n\r\nthe   management  committees  or  by  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation. We would rather that the provision  of\r\n\r\nfunds  be  a  spontaneous support  from  the  local\r\n\r\ncommunity,  so  that  it would  form  part  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  that we need to upgrade the facilities  in\r\n\r\nour  community centres. I think the Member is aware\r\n\r\nthat  most of our community centres were  built  in\r\n\r\nthe   1960's   to  cater  for  certain   types   of\r\n\r\nactivities.  By now I think most of  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  are either obsolete or badly  in  need  of\r\n\r\nrenovation  or  extension.  Because  of  this,  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Board of People's Association  have\r\n\r\nbeen doing their best in trying to get either funds\r\n\r\nor  other  facilities to provide better centres  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  places. There are lots of  things  we\r\n\r\nwould  like to do, but because of other priorities,\r\n\r\nI do not think we can implement all of them. At the\r\n\r\npresent   moment,  the  policy  of   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  is that it will try to  subsidise  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of community centres. In many  cases,  we\r\n\r\nhave  actually  encouraged the local  community  to\r\n\r\nraise  funds  for  the building  of  new  community\r\n\r\ncentres. We will also try to match these funds with\r\n\r\na  dollar-for-dollar subsidy up  to  a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$60,000. But where a constituency has not got  even\r\n\r\na community centre, then the policy of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation is that it will bear the entire cost of\r\n\r\nthe construction of the community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional centres in any constituency, other\r\n\r\nconsiderations have to be taken into  account.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  standard-type community centre, the subsidy will\r\n\r\nbe  on  a  dollar-for-dollar basis,  subject  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum   of  about  $80,000.  Where  the  existing\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre is insufficiently  equipped  with\r\n\r\nfacilities to serve the residents, the4 the subsidy\r\n\r\nwill be on a dollar-f or-dollar basis, subject to a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of $60~000. For the construction of  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, the subsidy will be on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a maximum of  $40,000.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  these sums will not be  sufficient  in\r\n\r\nview   of   the  high  cost  of  construction   and\r\n\r\nmaterials,  but we will try to do what  we  can  in\r\n\r\nthese circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also going to expand the activities of the\r\n\r\nYouth  Sub-Committees  feel  that  it  is  time  to\r\n\r\nencourage  youths  to  come forward  for  community\r\n\r\nservice, and there is nothing better to place  them\r\n\r\nin  the community centres so that they can at least\r\n\r\nhave a taste of what community life is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has mentioned about his\r\n\r\nCanoeing Club. It is true that his community centre\r\n\r\nin  Changi Point is the only centre with a Canoeing\r\n\r\nClub because that is the community centre which  is\r\n\r\nby  the seaside. I think even this community centre\r\n\r\nis  in  danger  of  being  taken  over  because  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment schemes. Bu course we will try to  find\r\n\r\nother  for such activities. However, right now,  we\r\n\r\nare  encouraging  our  youths  to  diversify  their\r\n\r\nactivities,   whether  it  be  canoeing,   archery,\r\n\r\nmountaineering other forms of activity. The  People\r\n\r\nAssociation   will  be  very  happy  to   entertain\r\n\r\napplications for subsidy for kinds of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, in view of the factor, I beg leave to withdraw\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead GA 3001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sum of $215,000 is earmarked for such\r\n\r\nrenovations as are required to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepare appropriate accommodation to house the  art\r\n\r\ncollection  of  the  University  of  Singapore.

The University\r\n\r\nart  collection, valuable and interesting as it is,\r\n\r\nwill now be made available to a much wider audience\r\n\r\nof  our citizens who will find its new location  at\r\n\r\nthe  National Museum more convenient than  its  old\r\n\r\nlocation  at the University. The art collection  is\r\n\r\nnotable  especially for the ceramics which cover  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  from 2000 BC to the 19th  century  AD.\r\n\r\nThe  ceramic  collection shows the  development  of\r\n\r\nChinese and South-east Asian ceramics over a period\r\n\r\nof  more  than 3,000 years. Other items like  cloth\r\n\r\nand  textiles together with the ceramic  collection\r\n\r\nreflect  the spread of Chinese and Indian influence\r\n\r\nthrough  trade  in South-east Asia. There  is  also\r\n\r\nsculpture  in  bronze and stone, as well  as  other\r\n\r\nitems   of  historical  value  like,  for  example,\r\n\r\ntopographical  water-colours artistically  executed\r\n\r\nby   a  well-known  artist.  Therefore,  both   the\r\n\r\nUniversity and the Ministry of Culture deserve  the\r\n\r\nthanks of the public for taking steps to make items\r\n\r\nof  our  common heritage more easily available  for\r\n\r\nthe enjoyment of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to use this amendment also\r\n\r\nas  a  peg to hang a reference to what has not been\r\n\r\ndone  as  well  as to what has been  done.  Besides\r\n\r\nalterations  to  house  the University  collection,\r\n\r\nthere  are alterations projected to turn a  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  National  Museum into an  art  gallery  to\r\n\r\ndisplay the paintings of our own artists as well as\r\n\r\nothers  and  to  represent an  attempt  to  further\r\n\r\nencourage  the  development  of  art  and  artistic\r\n\r\nappreciation among our people. However, we are  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether  this new art gallery  will  actually\r\n\r\nmaterialise.  The  proposal to construct  this  art\r\n\r\ngallery  is based on a subvention, at least  it  is\r\n\r\nbased on an optimistic expectation of a subvention,\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Arts  Council  of  about  three-quarter\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars. As a result of  the  increase  in\r\n\r\ncosts,  the total sum required is over $1  million.\r\n\r\nThe tender for the construction of this art gallery\r\n\r\nin the National Museum has to be accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin   a  matter  of  days.

Furthermore, even  after\r\n\r\nthe  art  gallery materialises, and I most solemnly\r\n\r\nand  heartily  hope  that  this  art  gallery  will\r\n\r\nmaterialise,  it is necessary for assurance  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven to keep this art gallery alive by building up\r\n\r\nits  collection  and encouraging activities  around\r\n\r\nthe art gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are yet other aspects of renovations to the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum which I would like to comment  on.\r\n\r\nIn   the   addendum  to  the  Presidential  Address\r\n\r\nrecorded in Hansard of 12th October, 1972, col. 48,\r\n\r\na paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Museum .., is being reorganised as a display\r\n\r\ncentre devoted to the art, history and anthropology\r\n\r\nof the peoples of this region.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  people  who  are running the Museum  have  got\r\n\r\nideas,  they have energy, but they have no  support\r\n\r\nin  practical terms, namely, money. There are  many\r\n\r\ncategories of collections in the Museum  which  are\r\n\r\nin storage. There are objects illustrating everyday\r\n\r\nlife  of our people through various stages  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our society. These exhibits have  to\r\n\r\nbe  presented in an interesting way with an  appeal\r\n\r\nto  visual and audial responses and with an appeal,\r\n\r\nif  possible, to a sense of touch and of  movement.\r\n\r\nWe need to use dioramas, where these can fruitfully\r\n\r\nbe  used,  and not the dull bulky cases with  which\r\n\r\nthe  present Museum is being equipped and which  it\r\n\r\nhas  inherited, like worthless heir-looms. And  the\r\n\r\nartifacts,  which the Museum has, which  relate  to\r\n\r\nour  heritage  have  to be interestingly  presented\r\n\r\nbecause  they  would be helpful  in  stimulating  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  history  and cultural tradition  in  our\r\n\r\npeople   and  a  pride  in  them  in  our  cultural\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, many of these artifacts have deteriorated.\r\n\r\nWoodwork  has been affected by worms and  termites;\r\n\r\ninappropriate lighting has caused fabric  to  fade,\r\n\r\nbleach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   even  crumble.  It  is  very  necessary  that\r\n\r\nconservation   measures   should   be   undertaken,\r\n\r\notherwise  evidence -valuable  evidence  -  of  our\r\n\r\ncultural past will be irretrievably lost. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  can generate the expertise, the  energy,\r\n\r\nthe initiative to be directed towards this sort  of\r\n\r\ncultural development but we need financial support.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money have been appropriated for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the Science Centre, and certainly an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of our scientific environment is also\r\n\r\npart of our culture. But what about the aspects  of\r\n\r\nour culture that may be enshrined and presented  in\r\n\r\nour  Museum  of art and history? They are  just  as\r\n\r\nimportant  to  stimulate, as I have  said,  in  our\r\n\r\npeople a response to their cultural environment, an\r\n\r\nappreciation,  an awareness of their  heritage,.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this will just as much contribute to a sense\r\n\r\nof  unity  among our people, even more so  perhaps,\r\n\r\nthan the Science Centre with which I certainly have\r\n\r\nno quarrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the senior Parliamentary Secretary in\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the Budget Statement last  year  in\r\n\r\nMarch,  1973, saying that more attention should  be\r\n\r\npaid  to  the  building  and strengthening  of  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for the development of  culture  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister himself has said in March  last  year\r\n\r\nthat  he  wanted to get down to something realistic\r\n\r\nwhere culture is concerned. Apparently he wanted to\r\n\r\nshy away from the abstract. How much more realistic\r\n\r\ncan  you  get  than by contriving to  get  monetary\r\n\r\nsupport for the development of the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the very little time\r\n\r\nhe  has  left to answer the questions that  I  have\r\n\r\nraised, the Minister will give us some creative and\r\n\r\nnew  answers, otherwise we may have to ask the same\r\n\r\nquestions  again  and  he  will  say  that  we  are\r\n\r\n\"putting new wine into old bottles\". If he were not\r\n\r\nto  uncock the old wine bottle and give out answers\r\n\r\nthat  are  old, perhaps we can ask questions  which\r\n\r\nwill  represent  a wine of a very fine  timbre  and\r\n\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, you have two minutes\r\n\r\nfor your creative answers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I shall try to be as\r\n\r\ncreative  as  possible. The $215,000  earmarked  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's Budget is to renovate three  galleries\r\n\r\nin the National Museum to put on public display the\r\n\r\nvaluable  art  collection  of  the  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore    which,   when   housed    in    proper\r\n\r\nsurroundings, will become easily accessible to  and\r\n\r\nbe  better appreciated by both our own citizens and\r\n\r\nforeign  visitors. I think this would be the  pride\r\n\r\nof   our  culture,  because  it  would  give   good\r\n\r\nexpression to our young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the coat which the Member for Katong was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  hang  on the peg, the art  gallery  was\r\n\r\nactually  a  scheme by the Singapore  Arts  Council\r\n\r\nwhich  has  generously provided a  capital  sum  of\r\n\r\n$760,000  to  turn part of the museum into  an  art\r\n\r\ngallery.   After  that  the  Government   will   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the running and maintenance of  the\r\n\r\ngallery  as  part  of  the  National  Museum   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, also as part of a Government department.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  view  of the high  cost  of  building\r\n\r\nmaterials, the inflationary trends and also because\r\n\r\nof  the  delay in preparing the plans, the cost  of\r\n\r\nestablishing an art gallery in the National  Museum\r\n\r\nhas gone up to $1.1 million. However, the Singapore\r\n\r\nArts Council has indicated that it will again cough\r\n\r\nout  an additional sum of about $388,000. There has\r\n\r\nbeen  some  argument as to who is to be responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the additional sum. My thinking on this matter\r\n\r\nis that we should get the project going, and we can\r\n\r\ntalk about the money later.

Then\r\n\r\nthe  NSPB  and  the  National  Stadium  Corporation\r\n\r\nmerged  and it i5 now known as the Singapore Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil. What is the outcome of the merger? Has  it\r\n\r\nhelped in any way in promoting sports? Nothing.  We\r\n\r\nstill   see   confusion  and  poor   standards   of\r\n\r\nperformance of our sportsmen. It seems that some of\r\n\r\nthe  officials of the Singapore Sports Council  are\r\n\r\nsnobbish and arrogant as reported in the press.  If\r\n\r\nit is true, can anything be done about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there is a weeding exercise\r\n\r\nbeing carried out on the former NSPB officials.  Is\r\n\r\nit   really  necessary?  These  people  are   being\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  inexperienced  people  who  have   no\r\n\r\nparticular interest in sports at all. Yet they  are\r\n\r\nbeing promoted within a short space of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, because of the introduction of inter-constituency games, soccer is catching up in\r\n\r\nSingapore and thus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanages to attract a fairly reasonable crowd at the\r\n\r\nJalan  Besar Stadium.

Is this not a waste? Perhaps a  reduction\r\n\r\nin  rentals for the complex may attract  the  crowd\r\n\r\nthat it badly needs.

Even during the period of the SEAP  games\r\n\r\nand  after  that,  the surrounds  of  the  National\r\n\r\nStadium  are a national disgrace. What we  see  are\r\n\r\ngood   lallang  fields  and  potholes,  ideal   for\r\n\r\nmosquito  breeding.  Surely  the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil   is   not  encouraging  the  breeding   of\r\n\r\n`sporting' mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SEAP games because of the poor\r\n\r\nresponse  on  certain  days, school  children  were\r\n\r\nadmitted  free.  But  what  a  mess  the  officials\r\n\r\ncreated.  Children  accompanied  by  parents   were\r\n\r\nsegregated. Sir, you can guess what the result  was\r\n\r\n-  missing  parents and missing children.  What  an\r\n\r\nimpression  we had given to the outside  world  one\r\n\r\ncan  only  wonder, and all because of some  foolish\r\n\r\nand childish decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stadium complex contains facilities for\r\n\r\nexhibitions,  etc.  How far are  they  being  used?\r\n\r\nAgain,  are  they being under-utilised  because  of\r\n\r\nhigh rentals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these snags, there is an exodus of\r\n\r\nexperienced  personnel from  the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil. It is time that a reorganisation was  made\r\n\r\nand  proper persons placed in office, not publicity\r\n\r\nseekers,  but  sportsmen in the real sense  of  the\r\n\r\nword.

There have  been\r\n\r\nremarks  that  the  National  Stadium  is  a  white\r\n\r\nelephant,   and  the  prospect  of  this  condition\r\n\r\nimproving  appears to be dim.

The aim is to make Singapore  a\r\n\r\nsports-loving nation. The people are being provided\r\n\r\nwith  better  and improved sporting facilities  and\r\n\r\nmore  facilities are being planned  and  developed.\r\n\r\nThe   manpower  in  coaching  of  games  is   being\r\n\r\nincreased.   Increased   utilisation   of    sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  is being actively promoted  and  sports\r\n\r\nand  games in schools are receiving a new emphasis.\r\n\r\nHow  the  people  respond depends on  the  personal\r\n\r\nvalues  and  attitudes and those of their  leaders.\r\n\r\nHow  our  sportsmen  fair in  competitions  against\r\n\r\nother  countries depends on the area or  region  of\r\n\r\ncompetition.  It has been shown very  clearly  that\r\n\r\nSingapore can hold its own in regional competitions\r\n\r\nas evidenced by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe high standards of performances of our sportsmen\r\n\r\nat the SEAP games last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press relations have been improved by regular\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  the  press. An effective  bilingual\r\n\r\nofficer  has recently been appointed as  press  and\r\n\r\npublic  relations officer to ensure  close  liaison\r\n\r\nwith the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about the\r\n\r\nabsorption  exercise.  In any absorption  exercise,\r\n\r\nsome  people will be selected and others  rejected.\r\n\r\nOfficers  of  the NSPB and the NSC  were  recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  various  organisations. Some  were  seconded,\r\n\r\nothers  were  on transfer, and some were  recruited\r\n\r\ndirect  by  the  two  bodies.  The  majority   were\r\n\r\ntemporary  officers. It was necessary to regularise\r\n\r\nthe  staffing  position so that suitably  qualified\r\n\r\nand  experienced  staff would be  absorbed  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council. This assessment was  made\r\n\r\nby   an   independent  body,  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission.   The  Member  need  not  suspect   the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the PSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no exodus of experienced personnel\r\n\r\nfrom  the  SSC. Every organisation in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nfacing the problem of staff movement because of the\r\n\r\nover-employment   and   booming    conditions    in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Last year, one senior staff of  the  SSC\r\n\r\nretired  while  two  seconded  Government  officers\r\n\r\nreturned to their respective Ministries after their\r\n\r\nperiod  of  secondment. Professional, clerical  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff  leave  because  the  SSC,  paying\r\n\r\nGovernment  salary scales, is unable to  match  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  paid by the private sector. The  SSC  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reorganised  and is being  strengthened  with\r\n\r\nsuitably experienced personnel from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  to ensure that sports in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nsee  a new era. The SSC is aware that football  has\r\n\r\nproblems,  and active measures have been  taken  to\r\n\r\nlook   after   its  administration.  A   group   of\r\n\r\nexperienced  and dedicated Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven the responsibility to manage football in  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These officials and the SSC will need the\r\n\r\ncollective   support   of   elected   Members    of\r\n\r\nParliament,   who   are   responsible   for   their\r\n\r\nconstituencies' sports associations, to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  games  continue with spontaneous participation\r\n\r\nand increasing spectator support. The SSC has drawn\r\n\r\nup  a  programme  of  inter-constituency  games  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with MPs. Certain guidelines were laid\r\n\r\ndown  for  the conduct of these games. It  was  the\r\n\r\nconsensus  of the MPs, present at the two  meetings\r\n\r\nto    discuss   inter-constituency   games,    that\r\n\r\nparticipation by the various constituencies  should\r\n\r\nbe spontaneous. Those constituencies that could not\r\n\r\nfill  teams would not participate. The response  to\r\n\r\nthe  table tennis tournament was encouraging.  That\r\n\r\nof   sepak  takraw  was  poor,  because   in   many\r\n\r\nconstituencies  the game does not  enjoy  the  same\r\n\r\ndegree  of  popularity as other games  do.  Another\r\n\r\nreason  for lesser participation is the  fact  that\r\n\r\nconstituency  sports associations are  being  newly\r\n\r\nestablished  and  have not been  consolidated  with\r\n\r\nadequate  manpower and financial resources.  Inter-constituency  Chinese chess was  omitted  from  the\r\n\r\n1974 programme at the request of MPs present at the\r\n\r\nsecond meeting to discuss inter-constituency sport.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Anson was absent. He would  perhaps\r\n\r\nbe  relieved to learn that the People's Association\r\n\r\nhas  been requested to promote what he called  this\r\n\r\n\"popular coffee-shop game\" at community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also spoke about incentives to encourage the\r\n\r\nsportsmen.  Sports  and  recreation  are   healthy,\r\n\r\nwholesome,  leisure-time activities.  They  develop\r\n\r\ntalents  in  individuals with  good  character  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline, team spirit, community cohesiveness and\r\n\r\nnational  loyalty. Are incentives  really  required\r\n\r\nfor  participation  in such a movement?  Steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing taken to ensure that emerging sportsmen  from\r\n\r\nour  schools  find suitable clubs to join  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  sporting  careers  are  developed  to  their\r\n\r\nbenefit  and to the benefit of the nation. The  SSC\r\n\r\nfurther offers sports facilities free of charge  to\r\n\r\nnational sports organisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  training  of  national  teams  for\r\n\r\ncompetition, locally and abroad. Injured  sportsmen\r\n\r\nare treated free in the Sports Medicine Unit of the\r\n\r\nSSC.   If   the  Member  is  thinking  of  monetary\r\n\r\nincentives for national sportsmen, this  will  have\r\n\r\nto be the responsibility of the respective national\r\n\r\nsports organisations. The SSC does not consider  it\r\n\r\nproper to disburse public funds among a handful  of\r\n\r\ntalented   sportsmen.   The   greatest   and   most\r\n\r\nsatisfying reward lies in being chosen to represent\r\n\r\nSingapore. It would really be a day of sorrow  when\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  performance of our  sportsmen  is\r\n\r\ndirectly proportionate to the size of their  pocket\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of the National Stadium, let me point\r\n\r\nout  that the National Stadium was not built solely\r\n\r\nto  host the 1973 SEAP Games. The moving force came\r\n\r\nfrom   sports  officials  in  the  national  sports\r\n\r\norganisation  way back in 1963. Sports  authorities\r\n\r\nat  that  time felt that Singapore's sportsmen  and\r\n\r\nsports fans deserved a modern sports stadium.  This\r\n\r\nis   still  true  today.  Our  sportsmen  performed\r\n\r\ncreditably,   even   beyond  the   expectation   of\r\n\r\nofficials,  in  the recent SEAP Games.  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament who witnessed the Games would have noted\r\n\r\nthis  spontaneous loyalty to the nation that  these\r\n\r\nGames  generated amongst sportsmen and  sportswomen\r\n\r\nwho  rose  to  the  occasion, and  among  fans  who\r\n\r\ncheered the national team with charged emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public amenities cost money to run. Clubs and\r\n\r\nassociations  which  are  reluctant  to   use   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of the National Stadium do  so  because\r\n\r\nthey  are poorly organised and are unable to  raise\r\n\r\nmonies for their programmes. The rental charged  at\r\n\r\nthe National Stadium has been carefully worked out.\r\n\r\nThey  are  correlated to charges  of  other  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities in Singapore. The user merely  pays  for\r\n\r\nthe  direct cost of the services provided. The  SSC\r\n\r\nis  unable to subsidise the use of the stadium,  as\r\n\r\nit  is being stretched to its maximum in trying  to\r\n\r\nearn  revenue to maintain its facilities. There  is\r\n\r\nno  stadium in the world which can be wholly run on\r\n\r\nits collections from sporting activities alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhibition area of the National Stadium has\r\n\r\nbeen   developed  on  the  initiative  of   Stadium\r\n\r\nauthorities. This is being actively promoted  among\r\n\r\norganisers  of trade fairs. It is true,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  sub-soil drainage system has been  inadequate,\r\n\r\nbut  I  have  not seen anybody yet fishing  in  the\r\n\r\nfield.   Steps  have  been  taken  to  remedy   the\r\n\r\nsituation.  The squash courts which were  built  at\r\n\r\nthe  National Stadium were originally not  part  of\r\n\r\nthe   Stadium  but  were  constructed  to  increase\r\n\r\nutilisation.  Viewing  galleries  for  squash   are\r\n\r\nconsidered a luxury. The maintenance of the  ground\r\n\r\noutside  the  National Stadium has still  not  been\r\n\r\nsettled  as  the  area  has  officially  not   been\r\n\r\nconfirmed  as  part  of the property  of  the  SSC.\r\n\r\nLastly,  Sir,  on  children who were  lost  in  the\r\n\r\nstadium. There might be one or two-odd children who\r\n\r\nwere separated from their parents momentarily,  but\r\n\r\nit  would  be  an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation was chaotic in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the queries raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens. He wanted to know the programme\r\n\r\nof  sports being considered by the SSC. The  sports\r\n\r\nprogramme of the SSC is at present limited  to  the\r\n\r\norganisation of inter-constituency games.  Together\r\n\r\nwith  the co-operation of the People's Association,\r\n\r\nit  will  encourage  and promote intra-constituency\r\n\r\ngames  mainly  for recreation and sports.  The  SSC\r\n\r\nwill  assist  national associations and  the  SNOC,\r\n\r\nthat is, the Singapore National Olympic Council, in\r\n\r\nthe  organisation and staging of national, regional\r\n\r\nand  international games. It has close liaison with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education and  is  assured  that\r\n\r\nsports and games are receiving adequate emphasis in\r\n\r\nthe   development  of  our  school  children.   The\r\n\r\npositive  methods being adopted to  encourage  mass\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  sports  in  Singapore   are   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to give sportsmen and supporters a new\r\n\r\nidentity.   Adult  sports  has  died  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a  lack of identification.  Sports  in\r\n\r\nSingapore received considerable support in  yester-years  because  they  were communal-orientated.  In\r\n\r\nmodern independent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore, loyalty to one's constituency  is  being\r\n\r\nactively promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, optimum use of existing facilities is\r\n\r\nbeing secured. School children are allowed to train\r\n\r\non  athletic tracks, without charge. Swimming pools\r\n\r\nare  being made available to the public from 7 a.m.\r\n\r\nto  10  p.m, on a continuous-use system,  so  that\r\n\r\nanybody may swim at a time convenient to him rather\r\n\r\nthan  on  the  present system of a fixed  or  block\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, schemes are being studied to increase\r\n\r\nthe amount of dual use of sports facilities so that\r\n\r\nconstituencies without sports facilities may  share\r\n\r\nin the use of facilities in other constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, planning for the future provision of\r\n\r\nsports  centres has begun in conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National  Development,  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board.  Urban  Renewal  Authority  and\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department. Such forward planning  on\r\n\r\nthe  nature and scale of sports centres and  stadia\r\n\r\nin  newly-planned urban areas and densely populated\r\n\r\nresidential   areas   will   ensure   the   orderly\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  sports facilities where  they  are\r\n\r\nmuch needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, existing sports facilities will be\r\n\r\nprogrammed  when funds are available to  allow  for\r\n\r\ndiverse and increasing participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, people are being made aware of what is\r\n\r\nhappening. Better liaison with the press  and  mass\r\n\r\nmedia has been established, which I have just said.\r\n\r\nSports and recreation will be promoted by publicity\r\n\r\nin  the  mass media, films and publications.  These\r\n\r\nare  only some of the methods being adopted. In the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis, mass participation  in  sports  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will only take place when the  drive  of\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean for wealth and prosperity can  be\r\n\r\ndirected towards the desire for a gracious style of\r\n\r\nliving  and  the  regular habit of taking  part  in\r\n\r\nsports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Judging  by  the  increasing\r\n\r\nnumber  of complaints against various aspects  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   service  appearing  daily   in   the\r\n\r\nreaders'  column of the various local press,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  the continuing large number of complaints\r\n\r\nhandled  by  the  Bureau  as  contained  in   the\r\n\r\nMinister's written answer to me recently,  it  is\r\n\r\nclear that our citizens are becoming conscious of\r\n\r\ntheir  entitlement  to  courteous  and  efficient\r\n\r\nservice from our civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bureau is performing a very important\r\n\r\nfunction.  It  is therefore rather  disappointing\r\n\r\nfor  me to note that from year to year no attempt\r\n\r\nseems to have been made to increase the number of\r\n\r\nstaff in this Department, to the extent that some\r\n\r\npeople  have come to me and said that they  would\r\n\r\nrather  write  to the press than to approach  the\r\n\r\nBureau,  because  by writing to  the  press  they\r\n\r\ncould get their problems solved very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears rather strange to me that the\r\n\r\nremuneration  of the officer in  charge  of  that\r\n\r\nDepartment should remain the same at $19,800.  Is\r\n\r\nit  because `he has not done his job well?  As  I\r\n\r\nhave   pointed  out  earlier,  in  view  of   the\r\n\r\nimportant functions of the Department, perhaps  a\r\n\r\nmore senior person should be put in charge there,\r\n\r\nperhaps a person with a status equivalent to that\r\n\r\nof a Permanent Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, in my written answer\r\n\r\nto the question of the Member, the actual fact is\r\n\r\nthat  the number of complaints has decreased from\r\n\r\n120  in 1972 to 93 in 1973. There is no increase.\r\n\r\nLooking at the work of the Bureau and also at the\r\n\r\ngeneral  nature  of the enquiries and  complaints\r\n\r\ndealt  with  by the Bureau, there is no  need  at\r\n\r\npresent  to strengthen the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Complaints Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the salary of the Director, which the\r\n\r\nMember  said  is  static,  he  has  reached   his\r\n\r\nmaximum.

I rise in support of their sentiments\r\n\r\nbecause it seems to me that there is obviously more\r\n\r\nroom  for  improvement  in the  Central  Complaints\r\n\r\nBureau,  and this will help to cut down the  number\r\n\r\nof  letters to the press. I am not against  letters\r\n\r\nbeing sent to the press, because I think people are\r\n\r\nfree  to express any opinion they like. But if  one\r\n\r\nwere  to plough through the papers and look at  the\r\n\r\ntype of complaints that have been lodged - some  of\r\n\r\nthese are very minor -- one does not see any reason\r\n\r\nwhy  this  should  be  in  the  press  at  all.  If\r\n\r\nanything,  it  gives  the public  and  the  foreign\r\n\r\ntourist  in  Singapore a very  poor  image  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  and,  sometimes, of  our  officers  in  the\r\n\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly\r\n\r\ngo  along with the previous speakers over the  need\r\n\r\nto increase the efficiency of the Complaints Bureau\r\n\r\nby  the increase of adequately qualified staff. But\r\n\r\nI think the Complaints Bureau will never be able to\r\n\r\ncompete with the press simply because complaints to\r\n\r\nthe  Bureau are not made public and the complainant\r\n\r\ndoes  not  get  the  satisfaction  of  seeing   his\r\n\r\ncomplaints  expressed publicly. The medium  of  the\r\n\r\npress, however, gives him that satisfaction because\r\n\r\nto  the complainant nothing is more satisfying than\r\n\r\nto see his grouse aired publicly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But talking about complaints, Sir, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether we have got a Complaints\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBureau in Parliament because I believe  the\r\n\r\nreporters who have got to work from 2.30 p.m, till\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m, are not supplied with tea. They are\r\n\r\nexperiencing great difficulty in getting tea around\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity.

If they  want  to  air\r\n\r\ntheir complaints in public, there is nothing I  can\r\n\r\ndo  to stop them. The only difference, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nwe  do not publicise what we do.

Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the point raised by the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai. The Minister for Social Affairs has said  in\r\n\r\nthis House on 21st March, 1972, [col. 940]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... that the arrangement for pilgrimage through\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of Tabong Haji or the Pilgrimage\r\n\r\nFund  will  include the provision  of  welfare  and\r\n\r\nhealth facilities for pilgrims during their sojourn\r\n\r\nin   Mecca,   Medina  and  Jeddah.  The  Pilgrimage\r\n\r\nCommittee  is considering the provision of  medical\r\n\r\nfacilities, including the services of a doctor  and\r\n\r\na  nurse  for the pilgrims when they are in  Mecca.\r\n\r\nThe provision of a welfare officer to look into the\r\n\r\nwelfare aspects of the pilgrims and the services of\r\n\r\na  reputable  pilgrim broker, .., are  also  being\r\n\r\nlooked into.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If these services mentioned by the Minister in 1972\r\n\r\nhave  still not been provided, I do not  know  when\r\n\r\ncan  they  be  provided, as two years have  already\r\n\r\nelapsed, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is that last year the\r\n\r\nPilgrimage Office in the Ministry of Social Affairs\r\n\r\nannounced  that  as  from 1974  Singapore  pilgrims\r\n\r\ntravelling  by  air  would  be  required   to   use\r\n\r\npilgrimage passports, and that they would no longer\r\n\r\nbe  using international passports as had been  done\r\n\r\nin  previous  years.  I wish to  know,  Sir,  which\r\n\r\ndepartment  will be responsible for  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nthese   pilgrimage  passports.  Would  it  be   the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Department,  the   Muslim   Religious\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Singapore, or the Malaysian Pilgrimage\r\n\r\nFund? Sir, I also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwish   to   know  if  this  requirement   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang Serai may wish to know that the Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council is now looking  into  the  whole\r\n\r\nmatter concerning pilgrimage and is considering the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a Pilgrimage Advisory Committee  for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of complaints from Singapore pilgrims\r\n\r\nregarding  the  treatment they receive  from  their\r\n\r\nagents or their pilgrim brokers. By and large, most\r\n\r\nof  the  complaints are not from Singapore pilgrims\r\n\r\nwho  travel by sea, as there is an arrangement with\r\n\r\nthe  Tabong Haji of Malaysia that their medical and\r\n\r\nwelfare  mission at Saudi Arabia will take care  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  pilgrims  arriving  by  sea.   But   the\r\n\r\narrangement  does  not  include  our  pilgrims  who\r\n\r\ntravel by air. There is, therefore, a need to  come\r\n\r\nto  some arrangement with the Malaysian authorities\r\n\r\nwhereby   their  network  of  medical  and  welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities all over Saudi Arabia will also be  made\r\n\r\navailable to our pilgrims who travel by air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may wish to know that for the period\r\n\r\n1970-73,   Singapore   has   made   the   following\r\n\r\ncontributions:  1970 $18,827;  1971  $14,540;  1972\r\n\r\n$16,349;    and    1973   $8,472.   These    annual\r\n\r\ncontributions  are  based  on  the  number  of  our\r\n\r\npilgrims who travel by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both Members referred to the need to provide\r\n\r\nwelfare   and  medical  facilities  for   Singapore\r\n\r\npilgrims during their pilgrimage to Mecca.  I  must\r\n\r\nfirst stress that to establish a network of welfare\r\n\r\nand  medical facilities in Saudi Arabia is  a  very\r\n\r\ncostly  business.  It  costs  our  neighbour  about\r\n\r\n$450,000   a   year.   The   present   satisfactory\r\n\r\narrangement  with the Tabong Haji of Malaysia  does\r\n\r\nnot   warrant  the  setting  up  of  an   elaborate\r\n\r\norganisation  only to duplicate  the  services  and\r\n\r\nfacilities which are already made available to  us.\r\n\r\nHowever, something modest may be possible along the\r\n\r\nlines  of what I had suggested in the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply in March, 1972. The Muslim Religious Council\r\n\r\nhas already planned the establishment of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operative to build a Pilgrimage Fund. Once  this\r\n\r\nscheme  is fully implemented, it should be possible\r\n\r\nto   consider   providing   medical   and   welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities if these are found necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our immediate concern is to ensure that\r\n\r\npilgrim  brokers  do  not make  empty  promises  to\r\n\r\npilgrims  and  their agents in  Mecca,  Medina  and\r\n\r\nJeddah.  They  must be really reliable  people  who\r\n\r\ncarry  Out their duties diligently and not just  be\r\n\r\ninterested  in making money by taking  on  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of pilgrims if they cannot manage or provide\r\n\r\nthem  with adequate facilities. In this connection,\r\n\r\nthe  officials of the Muslim Religious Council will\r\n\r\nbe  holding  a meeting of all pilgrim brokers.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil welcomes any information on pilgrim brokers\r\n\r\nor  their  agents. If the services of these  people\r\n\r\nare  unsatisfactory in any way, their licences will\r\n\r\nnot be renewed in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of extending medical welfare\r\n\r\nservices  and facilities to pilgrims who travel  by\r\n\r\nair  to  perform  the  Haj is  being  looked  into.\r\n\r\nOfficials of the Muslim Religious Council  will  be\r\n\r\nholding    discussions   with    their    Malaysian\r\n\r\ncounterparts on this matter. For the time being, we\r\n\r\nare  considering  the  possibility  of  sending   a\r\n\r\nwelfare   officer  to  Saudi  Arabia   during   the\r\n\r\npilgrimage season to look after the welfare of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens performing the Haj.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from this year onwards prospective\r\n\r\npilgrims  proceeding to Saudi Arabia,  irrespective\r\n\r\nof  the mode of travel, will be issued with pilgrim\r\n\r\npasses  by  the  Pilgrim Officers.  The  Pilgrimage\r\n\r\nOffice has started the registration of all pilgrims\r\n\r\nfor  the current pilgrimage season. However, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  pilgrims travelling by air,  arrangements\r\n\r\nare  being made with the Immigration Department  to\r\n\r\nissue  international passports with a pilgrim  pass\r\n\r\nendorsement  to  obviate  the  necessity  for  such\r\n\r\npilgrims   to  possess  two  documents.   Such   an\r\n\r\narrangement  would  be economically  beneficial  to\r\n\r\npilgrims  as they only need to pay for one passport\r\n\r\ninstead of two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In view of the\r\n\r\nMinister's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I do not  apportion\r\n\r\nany  blame at all either to the Director  of  Legal\r\n\r\nAid  or to his officers because of the shortage  of\r\n\r\nmanpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1968 there has been no in-crease at\r\n\r\nall in the number of legal officers assigned to the\r\n\r\nBureau. In 1968, that is, six years ago, there were\r\n\r\nfour  legal  officers,  other  than  the  Director.\r\n\r\nToday, with the increase in the workload and in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people  seeking legal  assistance,  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  strength remains the same.  If  this\r\n\r\nposition  is not improved, the time will come  when\r\n\r\nthe  whole machinery of the Bureau is bogged  down,\r\n\r\nand  the very purpose for which the Bureau has been\r\n\r\nset  up would be defeated. I hope the Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs will not refer me to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the time\r\n\r\ntaken  to  complete  a  case would  vary  with  its\r\n\r\ncircumstances. Civil cases normally take some  time\r\n\r\nto  settle. Usually it will be necessary to  obtain\r\n\r\nreports,  notes  of  evidence  and  other  relevant\r\n\r\nmaterial from various sources. Sometimes more  time\r\n\r\nis   required   because  of  the   involved   court\r\n\r\nproceedings. Therefore, the delay is unavoidable. I\r\n\r\nregret it very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons applying for legal aid are normally given\r\n\r\nan  appointment two or three weeks after they  have\r\n\r\nregistered  their  cases.  Although  the  situation\r\n\r\ncould  be improved, the Bureau could not have  done\r\n\r\nbetter  in  view of the limited staff and increased\r\n\r\nwork-load. The number of applications for legal aid\r\n\r\nhas  increased from 3,745 in 1972 to 4,394 in 1973,\r\n\r\nand  the number of staff that we have is only  five\r\n\r\nlegal  officers and four interpreters to deal  with\r\n\r\nall  these  cases. Fortunately we  have  one  legal\r\n\r\nofficer  on  loan  to  the  Bureau  and  a  student\r\n\r\ninterpreter who is attached to the Bureau on a part-time  basis. However, the Member may wish  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  staffing  position  is  still  far  from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  and we are pressing the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance very hard for more staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

He has the support of the Members from this\r\n\r\nside  of  the  House, but I am  afraid  he  is  not\r\n\r\nfighting  hard  enough. Since 1968,  i.e, for  six\r\n\r\nyears, the strength has still been only four  legal\r\n\r\nofficers and one Director; only five officers since\r\n\r\n1968.  On  the  one hand we have some  departments,\r\n\r\nbureaux  and  units  where  more  people  are   not\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and on the other hand we are  short  of\r\n\r\nofficers in some departments.

May  I  quote  myself   from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 28, col. 1005?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`whether he [that is, the Minister] is aware that\r\n\r\nthe Co-operative Societies Ordinance which was last\r\n\r\namended  in  1955,  is  outdated  and  if  he  will\r\n\r\nconsider   setting   up   a  committee   comprising\r\n\r\nofficials   from   the   Co-operative   Development\r\n\r\nDivision,  the co-operative movement and the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement to review the Ordinance;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let  me now quote the reply given then in the  same\r\n\r\ncolumn of the Hansard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.., the Ministry will consider making\r\n\r\namendments, if necessary, to the Ordinance in order\r\n\r\nto   meet  the  practical  difficulties  which  co-operative  societies  have  experienced  with   the\r\n\r\nexisting Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  these words were spoken in April, 1969,  five\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  Since then, the Ordinance  has  become\r\n\r\nmore  archaic  now. Perhaps it  should  go  to  the\r\n\r\nNational Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are happy to note, however, that the\r\n\r\nMinister   is  inclined  to  help  the   NTUC   co-operatives,  as may be necessary in recognition  of\r\n\r\nthe  services they are rendering towards  consumers\r\n\r\nby offering them goods and services at fair prices.\r\n\r\nTo curb undue profiteering and to stabilise prices,\r\n\r\nco-operative   ventures   should   be   given   all\r\n\r\nencouragement. In this connection, I would like  to\r\n\r\ndraw the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention   of   the  House  to  the   Co-operative\r\n\r\nSocieties Act which was promulgated as far back  as\r\n\r\n1925 but has not undergone much basic change in the\r\n\r\nmeanwhile. The provisions and rules made thereunder\r\n\r\ndo  not,  therefore, take cognizance of the changed\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social conditions now prevailing  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic. It is now agreed by the  authorities\r\n\r\nas   well  as  those  connected  with  various  co-operative   societies   that   the   Act   requires\r\n\r\nsubstantial  amendments. In fact, in  April,  1973,\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Co-operative Societies called in an\r\n\r\nILO  expert, Dr Jurgen Von Muralt, to look into the\r\n\r\nmatter.   Having  held  discussions  with   various\r\n\r\npeople, including the NTUC, Dr Muralt is on  record\r\n\r\nas   saying   that  the  Act  requires  re-writing.\r\n\r\nHowever, since then no further developments  appear\r\n\r\nto have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the provisions applying to meetings,\r\n\r\nquorums  and  filing of various  returns  with  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Co-operatives, the items which  require\r\n\r\nlooking into are: (1) The 6 per cent limit  on  the\r\n\r\ndividends on the capital of a co-operative society.\r\n\r\n(2)  Provisions  for reserves. (3) Restrictions  on\r\n\r\ninvestments.   As   banks   and   other   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions currently allow much more than  6  per\r\n\r\ncent  interest  on  their  fixed  deposits,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for the co-operative societies to attract\r\n\r\nthe necessary capital funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While for some primary societies the provisions\r\n\r\nunder (2) and (3), i.e, provisions for reserves and\r\n\r\nrestrictions on investments, might have been useful\r\n\r\nin  the  olden days they are unduly restrictive  if\r\n\r\nthe  co-operatives want to enlarge their  field  of\r\n\r\noperation. This is especially so in the case of non-primary  societies operating in specialised  fields\r\n\r\nsuch as insurance and banking. These societies  are\r\n\r\nalso   governed  by  specific  Acts  such  as   the\r\n\r\nInsurance Act and the Banking Act which do regulate\r\n\r\nappropriately   their   investments   and   reserve\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther   restrictions   under   the   Co-operative\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act  are  not necessarily  conducive  to\r\n\r\ntheir orderly progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we need not have to wait for another\r\n\r\nfive  years  before something is done  by  the  Co-operative Development Division.

We also know that the  way  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  profiteering is to set up more  consumer  co-operatives. The Ministry of Social Affairs can do a\r\n\r\nlot more in this respect.

Dr\r\n\r\nVon  Muralt  recommended that the  services  of  an\r\n\r\nexpert  be  obtained to redraft  the  existing  Co-operative Societies Act. It is expected, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nvery  soon  an  expert on co-operative  legislation\r\n\r\nfrom abroad, maybe from New Zealand or from the ILO\r\n\r\nitself,  will be here on a six-month assignment  to\r\n\r\nredraft the legislation. Once this is done, all the\r\n\r\nother  related problems can he looked into  further\r\n\r\nand with depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong no doubt is aware of the\r\n\r\nbasic      principle     governing     co-operative\r\n\r\norganisations throughout the world  -  that  a  co-operative  is  an association of persons  who  have\r\n\r\nvoluntarily joined together to achieve a common end\r\n\r\nthrough   the   formation   of   a   democratically\r\n\r\ncontrolled    organisation,    making     equitable\r\n\r\ncontributions to the capital required and accepting\r\n\r\na  fair  share  of  the risks and benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nundertaking   in   which   the   members   actively\r\n\r\nparticipate. In other words, co-operative societies\r\n\r\nare  autonomous organisations formed by persons  on\r\n\r\nthe   basis   of   equality  to  promote   economic\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operatives determine their own management\r\n\r\npolicies and activities. Sometimes failure  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  results  in  financial  difficulty  and\r\n\r\ninability to complete projects to the detriment  of\r\n\r\nmembers.  Under the existing Co-operative Societies\r\n\r\nAct   and   rules,   the  Registrar   has   certain\r\n\r\nsupervisory  and advisory functions, but  he  could\r\n\r\nnot and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  interfere with the internal  financial\r\n\r\nadministration of co-operatives other than checking\r\n\r\non the financial position and ascertaining that the\r\n\r\nactivities are run in accordance with the  bye-laws\r\n\r\nof the co-operative legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings up the next point on the functions of\r\n\r\nthe  Registry. The Member for Katong  may  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow  that the title \"Co-operative Development\"  in\r\n\r\nthe Estimates is an old title inherited in the days\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Co-operative  Development  Division  was\r\n\r\nunder  the Primary Production Department.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime  the  intention  was  to  promote  rural   co-operatives as part of the functions of the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department. The present Registry,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  inheriting this title in the Estimates,  also\r\n\r\ninherited  the structure and functions and  also  a\r\n\r\nsmall   staff   geared  only  to  carry   out   the\r\n\r\nadministrative and auditing duties as far as  other\r\n\r\nco-operative  societies are concerned.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ngeared   for  promotional  research  and   training\r\n\r\nfunctions  which  are  considered  vital  for   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of  the  co-operative  movement   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Whether the Registry can be reorganised\r\n\r\nfor  these  roles  or not will depend  to  a  large\r\n\r\nextent  upon  the availability of additional  staff\r\n\r\nwhich, unfortunately, was not made available to  us\r\n\r\ndespite strong representation from the Ministry and\r\n\r\ndespite  the  recommendations of  the  ILO  expert.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  shortage of staff which has  remained\r\n\r\nunchanged all these years, the Registrar has  drawn\r\n\r\nup an ambitious programme which has already created\r\n\r\nsome  impact  and helped the movement not  only  in\r\n\r\ndiversifying its activities but also in  developing\r\n\r\na sense of common purpose and common identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still much to he done. In April\r\n\r\nlast  year a plan of action to strengthen  the  co-operative  movement has been drawn up.  School  co-operatives  are  being  established.  Consumer  co-operatives  are  being  encouraged  throughout  the\r\n\r\neconomic  sector.  There is  now  a  close  working\r\n\r\nrelationship between the Registry and the Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Co-operative Union and the  NTUC.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped   that   in  time  to  come  a   co-operative\r\n\r\nfederation will be formed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonitor  the activities and give new directions  to\r\n\r\nthe  co-operative  movement in Singapore.  The  co-operative  legislation  will  be  revised  to  suit\r\n\r\npresent-day needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made specific reference to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government  Officers'  Co-operative\r\n\r\nHousing Society and the role of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies in solving the problems of this\r\n\r\nsociety.  As  I  have stated earlier,  co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties   are   autonomous   organisations.   The\r\n\r\nproblems of this particular society could have been\r\n\r\neasily solved by the sale of properties since  that\r\n\r\nCo-operative   has  considerable  capital   assets,\r\n\r\nincluding  buildings and lands, but the  management\r\n\r\nconsidered this to be a last resort. The  Registrar\r\n\r\nin  circumstances  like this  cannot  overstep  his\r\n\r\nauthority  by  imposing  his  will  upon  the   Co-operative to order it to sell its properties  at  a\r\n\r\ntime when property prices were rising rapidly.  The\r\n\r\nRegistrar  very  prudently avoided a  confrontation\r\n\r\nwith  the  management and endeavoured to  help  the\r\n\r\nsociety in other ways. A loan was arranged from the\r\n\r\nGovernment to strengthen the financial position  of\r\n\r\nthe  Co-operative. The activities of  this  Society\r\n\r\nare  being  closely supervised to  prevent  further\r\n\r\nmisuse  of  funds  and  mismanagement.  Also,   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  insisted on a priority list for  refunds\r\n\r\nto  be  drawn  up.  Priority  was  given  to  those\r\n\r\nresigned   members  who  could  furnish  proof   of\r\n\r\npurchasing  flats or houses on their  own.  So  far\r\n\r\nabout  700  resigned  members have  realised  their\r\n\r\nassets.  I  am not aware of any instance where  the\r\n\r\nSociety has overcharged its members for payment  of\r\n\r\nhouses. The Society normally estimates the price of\r\n\r\na   housing  unit  and  grants  loans  to   members\r\n\r\namounting  to 7/8ths of the estimated  price.  This\r\n\r\ndoes  not  include charges incurred by the  Society\r\n\r\nfor  the  completion  of the houses,  for  example,\r\n\r\nroads,  drains, sewerage, planning and  architect's\r\n\r\nfees  and  legal fees, and so on. In  addition,  it\r\n\r\ncharges  one  per cent on those members'  borrowing\r\n\r\nrate of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member's question on co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  in  general, he may be pleased  to  know\r\n\r\nthat   at   present   there  are  77   co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Out  of  these,  seven  are  considered\r\n\r\ninactive, but I do not think they are \"lost in  the\r\n\r\nwilderness\"  as  efforts  are  being  made  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  to  revive  them. I would  also  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  the Member that there are no crocodiles  in\r\n\r\nthe  co-operative movement. Co-operative  societies\r\n\r\nare  closely  supervised by  the  Registrar.  Their\r\n\r\naccounts are periodically audited by the Registry's\r\n\r\nofficials,  including an accountant  working  part-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-operatives are entirely different from chit\r\n\r\nfunds.  The  co-operative system and principle  are\r\n\r\nspecially designed to improve the economic,  social\r\n\r\nand  cultural  situation of any country,  and  more\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  groups of  people  with  limited\r\n\r\nresources and opportunities, based on the principle\r\n\r\nof  self-help and mutual co-operation.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy to encourage the  movement  to\r\n\r\ngrow,  and to curb inflation greater emphasis  will\r\n\r\nbe  laid on the formation of consumer co-operatives\r\n\r\nand the WELCOME-type supermarkets. More and more of\r\n\r\nthe   existing  co-operative  societies  are  being\r\n\r\nencouraged to form themselves as multi-purpose  co-operative  societies whose activities will  include\r\n\r\nbulk purchasing to enable members to purchase goods\r\n\r\nat  a low price. The Member's suggestion, Sir,  for\r\n\r\nessential  products  to be channelled  through  the\r\n\r\nappropriate  co-operative societies  is  a  welcome\r\n\r\none.  Already we have the NTUC WELCOME Co-operative\r\n\r\nwhose organisation can easily take on this role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

I notice that a\r\n\r\nsum  of  $4  million  is  to  be  allocated  as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment loan to the Singapore Sports Council  to\r\n\r\nmeet  final payment for the cost of Phase I of  the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium complex. I would, therefore,  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Hon.

Since  there  will  be   no   Phase   II\r\n\r\ndevelopment   for  the  National  Stadium   Complex\r\n\r\nconstruction, I would like to ask the Hon.

After  the  usual pruning  down  to  bare\r\n\r\nessentials,  a  certain sum  is  allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  either in the form of a loan  for  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  or in the form of a grant  for  sports\r\n\r\npromotion. The total amount that has been loaned to\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Sports  Council  to  date  is  $12\r\n\r\nmillion. There has been no repayment by the Council\r\n\r\nso far, because they cannot afford it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the coming into operation of the Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council,  the takings at the  gate  of  the\r\n\r\nStadium  amounted to only $41,000. So you can  see,\r\n\r\nSir,  that it is insufficient to cover the cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the Stadium, which averages slightly\r\n\r\nover $400,000 annually. From the start, it is never\r\n\r\nintended  that  the  entire proceeds  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nPools   (Pte)   Ltd, are  to  be  used   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of Phase II of the Stadium.

The Social Welfare Department has  given\r\n\r\ncare  and  comfort  to the poor  and  the  sick  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  has always been the policy  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to look after the poor people.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment because of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe rising cost of living resulting from spiralling\r\n\r\ninflation,  many people are suffering in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause of the high cost of daily necessities  such\r\n\r\nas  rice, food, sugar and other items. In addition,\r\n\r\nthe  costs  of other items such as rent, water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity  have  also  gone  up.  So,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, judging from the present situation, I\r\n\r\nam   afraid  that  the  present  public  assistance\r\n\r\ngranted  to  the  poor people  is  inadequate.  The\r\n\r\nmeagre  sum  granted  under the  public  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme is too little for the livelihood of the poor\r\n\r\nfamily.  May  I therefore request the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  revising the rates of public assistance\r\n\r\nso that the poor people on public assistance can be\r\n\r\nbetter looked after, in the face of the rising cost\r\n\r\nof living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nanswer this question: how much has been granted  by\r\n\r\nway  of  public assistance to the needy  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  any plan or scheme to set up a home  for\r\n\r\nthe handicapped children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Haji Mohd.

If,  in  his\r\n\r\nopinion, the facilities are inadequate, what  would\r\n\r\nbe  the  Government's policy towards  the  care  of\r\n\r\nthese old and chronic sick people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with reference to the question posed by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson regarding the temple mentioned\r\n\r\nin  the  local press on the 17th March  this  year,\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  would the Government take towards  the\r\n\r\nsupervision and control of establishments, such  as\r\n\r\nthat  temple  in  question, which purportedly  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  old  and aged  sick?  It  is  common\r\n\r\nknowledge that there are in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexistence in Singapore a good number of such places\r\n\r\nwhich   are   neither  licensed   nor   under   the\r\n\r\nsupervision  of  either  the  Ministry  of   Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  or  the Council of Social Services.  This\r\n\r\ntemple in question has, in fact, been usurping  its\r\n\r\nname  by charging its inmates from $50 to $180  per\r\n\r\nhead.  I think there is a case for the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nstep in to regulate and, if possible, supervise its\r\n\r\nactivities.  At  the  same  time,  it  should  also\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  provisions for  the  care  of  such\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go on to a second topic with regard\r\n\r\nto  grants  or subventions to voluntary  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations. May I ask the Minister what  is  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  policy in deciding  grants  to\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations? It is  well-known\r\n\r\nthat  no formula is used by the Ministry of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  with regard to the provision of  voluntary\r\n\r\ngrants to welfare organisations. Would the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a standard formula in granting\r\n\r\naids  to  these voluntary organisations? A standard\r\n\r\nformula  has  been utilised in some countries,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  Hong Kong, Japan and Australia,  to  good\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of a committee to review aid to\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations,  I  understand   that   a\r\n\r\ncommittee was set up by the Government last year to\r\n\r\nreview  grants  to voluntary organisations.  I  was\r\n\r\nsurprised  to learn that the Singapore  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Services which is, in fact, a statutory body\r\n\r\nconcerned   with  matters  relating  to   voluntary\r\n\r\ncharitable organisations, was not consulted on this\r\n\r\nmatter,  and  neither was it asked to sit  on  this\r\n\r\ncommittee. I would like, if possible, to  find  out\r\n\r\nthe reason for its exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the matter of public assistance, I\r\n\r\nthink  there are grounds today for us  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   to  reconsider  the  rates   of   public\r\n\r\nassistance. I know that this is an issue  on  which\r\n\r\nthe Government has very definite ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to encourage people to be passengers\r\n\r\nbut,  at  the same time, we must realise  that  the\r\n\r\ncost of living has spiralled significantly over the\r\n\r\nlast  year. I can show Members concerned here  that\r\n\r\nthe public assistance scheme is certainly far below\r\n\r\nwhat can really provide for a subsistence level for\r\n\r\nthe recipients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I seek to find out is really this. Would the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Social Affairs consider a readjustment\r\n\r\nin  the  means  test? This would,  therefore,  give\r\n\r\nincentive to a member or members of a family  under\r\n\r\nwelfare  aid.  We know that a family  under  public\r\n\r\nassistance can receive no more than $70 and another\r\n\r\nfamily under tuberculosis assistance not more  than\r\n\r\n$120.  If we were to stick to the means test  under\r\n\r\nthe  present  scheme, then if a  member  under  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance scheme were to come home with  a\r\n\r\nsalary  of  $120, in effect, he will  be  receiving\r\n\r\nonly  $10  from  public  assistance.  This  is   no\r\n\r\nincentive at all for anyone in a family to  go  out\r\n\r\nand  work  in order to increase the family  income.\r\n\r\nThe  same  can be said for those under tuberculosis\r\n\r\nassistance.  I am quite willing to provide  details\r\n\r\nof  such cases. My intention is that in readjusting\r\n\r\nthe  means  test we can, with the present inflation\r\n\r\nand  high  cost of living, also provide these  poor\r\n\r\nand needy people with incentive to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, can I speak on my amendment  on  Head\r\n\r\nKB, subhead AD 1201*?\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head KB be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AD 1201.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe  proposal by the Member for Sembawang.

Yet  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not considered whether  or  not  to\r\n\r\nincrease the public assistance. The workers have so\r\n\r\nfar received two salary increases, first, the 9 per\r\n\r\ncent wage supplement as recommended by the NWC and,\r\n\r\nsecond,  the $25 interim wage supplement. But  what\r\n\r\nabout  the  people who depend on public  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Social Welfare Department?  Should  they\r\n\r\nalso not be given an increase in public assistance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to add my\r\n\r\nviews  on  this subject. First of all, let  mc  say\r\n\r\nthat  I agree very much with what has been said  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kim Seng, and that is, that care for\r\n\r\nthe  aged and the sick, as is being given  now,  is\r\n\r\nnot enough. In my view, it is not enough because  I\r\n\r\nfound  that  certain aged people who  need  certain\r\n\r\ncare are not given proper care or accommodation  as\r\n\r\nin  the  home for the aged. In this respect I  feel\r\n\r\nthe  Government should remedy the situation. We all\r\n\r\nagree  that  the cost of living is now  increasing.\r\n\r\nEverybody  is hoping that members of a family  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  get  a  job and earn  some  money  to\r\n\r\nsupplement    the    family    expenditure.     But\r\n\r\nunfortunately  if there is one aged member  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily  who  needs  particular  care,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot look after such people, then  can\r\n\r\nit  be  taken  as a loss of income  to  the  family\r\n\r\nconcerned?  From what I have seen  of  the  various\r\n\r\nhomes  for the aged, the facilities there are  very\r\n\r\npoor   and   their  conditions  are  not  hygienic.\r\n\r\nWhatever  views I may have of these homes,  T  hope\r\n\r\nthe Government would not overlook them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of food for the aged, I feel that\r\n\r\nthey do not have proper food. From what I have seen\r\n\r\nat  the homes for the aged, the food provided  cost\r\n\r\nno  more than Si per day for each person. At a time\r\n\r\nwhen  prices of food are so high, T feel  that  the\r\n\r\namount of food provided is really too little. So in\r\n\r\nline with what the other Members have said, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for Social Affairs to give\r\n\r\nus a definite answer as to whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  this  moment  he is considering  any  steps  to\r\n\r\nremedy  what needs to be remedied to improve  their\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  just now I heard various colleagues  of  mine\r\n\r\nappealing  to  the Minister for Social  Affairs  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the aid to the aged who are  without  any\r\n\r\nproper  care.  I  very much agree with  this  view.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  feel  that the customary  practice  of\r\n\r\nproviding aid to the aged is not the final solution\r\n\r\nin  the  long-term. I believe that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  try  to  seek other avenues. For  instance,\r\n\r\nGovernment can look for certain light jobs for  the\r\n\r\naged  so as to help them to be productive. In  this\r\n\r\nway  these aged people will find that not only  are\r\n\r\nthey  occupied  but  they are also  useful  to  the\r\n\r\nsociety. Therefore, they will not be a parasite  to\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  take  this  opportunity to  echo  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncomments and observations which have been  made  by\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers.  I  think  the  facilities  and\r\n\r\nprovisions in these institutions definitely need to\r\n\r\nbe improved. As mentioned by previous speakers, the\r\n\r\namount   of   public  assistance  given   is   very\r\n\r\ninadequate   in   view   of  the   rapid   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and high cost of living. Unless  these\r\n\r\nfacilities   are   improved  and  the   subsistence\r\n\r\nallowances are also proportionately increased, I am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Minister will agree that eventually  our\r\n\r\nsociety  will  have  to pay more  for  the  present\r\n\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not agree with the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nin  describing the aged, who are without  care,  as\r\n\r\nsocial parasites, because there is a Chinese saying\r\n\r\nthat  we  should give due respect to the  aged  and\r\n\r\nbefriend the childless and look after them.  As  we\r\n\r\nall  know, these aged people do not have anyone  to\r\n\r\nsupport them. We must, therefore, respect them  and\r\n\r\nput  them in the home for the aged. This is one way\r\n\r\nof  showing  our esteem and respect  for  them.  To\r\n\r\napply  the  term \"social parasite\"  to  these  aged\r\n\r\npeople is, therefore, improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I share the sentiments expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember  just now, when he said that the  amount  of\r\n\r\npublic   assistance  to  such  people   should   he\r\n\r\nincreased because they are in dire need. They would\r\n\r\nnot  try  to  fool the Government into giving  them\r\n\r\nmore aid. They are in actual need of more financial\r\n\r\nassistance.  The  present amount of  assistance  is\r\n\r\nmerely  a  pittance to them and is only  enough  to\r\n\r\nkeep  them on a bare level of subsistence.  It  can\r\n\r\nneither  fill  their stomachs nor  starve  them  to\r\n\r\ndeath.  We should therefore increase the amount  of\r\n\r\npublic   assistance  in  the   present   state   of\r\n\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  make a clarification.

Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament   may   rest  assured  that   everything\r\n\r\npossible  will  be done to alleviate  the  hardship\r\n\r\nexperienced by those people as a result of the rise\r\n\r\nin prices of essential goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the guideline and permit for\r\n\r\nentertainment of inmates of welfare  homes  of  the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department, no permit is issued  for\r\n\r\npurposes  of visiting and entertaining  inmates  of\r\n\r\nwelfare  homes by community groups. What  community\r\n\r\ngroups are required to do, if they wish to visit  a\r\n\r\ncreche  or a certain home, is to contact the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department for permission, not a permit, to\r\n\r\ndo so. Normally such permission is readily granted.\r\n\r\nIt  is the policy of the department to welcome  and\r\n\r\nencourage more people to visit the welfare homes to\r\n\r\nbring cheer to the inmates. The department has  not\r\n\r\nrefused  any  organisation a visit to  the  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes,  except in circumstances where  such  visits\r\n\r\nwould embarrass the inmates of a particular home or\r\n\r\nupset law and order in the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed visits that might have been refused by\r\n\r\nthe  department would be visits by young males with\r\n\r\nlong  hair to a girls' home, or male visitors whose\r\n\r\nintention to visit a girls' home for ex-prostitutes\r\n\r\nwas  doubtful. In other circumstances,  a  proposed\r\n\r\nvisit  to  entertain  only a particular  ethnic  or\r\n\r\nracial group within a home has been discouraged, as\r\n\r\nsuch  acts  of discrimination or favouritism  could\r\n\r\nupset  the  law and order in the homes  which  have\r\n\r\nmany inmates of other races. Entertainment for  the\r\n\r\ninmates of the homes should not be confined to  any\r\n\r\nparticular  racial group because we cater  for  all\r\n\r\nthe  inmates in the homes. Examples of such  cross-sectional entertainment are a grand dinner recently\r\n\r\ngiven by a commercial organisation to all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninmates of the Woodlands Home for the Aged  and  an\r\n\r\nannual  Chinese  New Year party when  all  inmates,\r\n\r\nirrespective   of  race  or  ethnic   group,   were\r\n\r\nentertained   together.  The  Government   welcomes\r\n\r\nwelfare   service  by  community  groups  but   not\r\n\r\nracialist welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the particular old people's\r\n\r\nhome,  I assume the Member is referring to the  Poh\r\n\r\nThong  See  Buddhist Old People's Home in  Aljunied\r\n\r\nRoad. I must say that the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nhas  never  refused to give a helping hand  to  the\r\n\r\ninmates  of this particular Home, as alleged  by  a\r\n\r\nMember.  On the contrary, I am satisfied  that  our\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department has in the past done  all\r\n\r\nit can to help the inmates of this particular Home.\r\n\r\nOut  of  the 80 inmates of the Home, 51 are  paying\r\n\r\ncases, i.e, they are financially supported by their\r\n\r\nown   relatives  and  dependants  who  pay  monthly\r\n\r\nmaintenance  charges ranging from $60 to  $180  per\r\n\r\nhead to the monk in charge. The department has been\r\n\r\nhelping  the  remaining cases, which are  eligible,\r\n\r\nwith public assistance allowances ranging from  $28\r\n\r\nto  $50  per  month and with other  forms  of  help\r\n\r\nwherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to assume that the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  only acts after publicity is  given  in\r\n\r\nthe press of any such stories. In fact, long before\r\n\r\npublicity  was made in the press on this particular\r\n\r\nHome, the Social Welfare Department has during  the\r\n\r\npast  years been giving assistance to this Home  in\r\n\r\nits usual quiet and unannounced manner. Every month\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  officers  visit  this  Home.   The\r\n\r\ndepartment   has  been  consulting   the   relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  on  ways  and  means  to  improve  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of living of the inmates.  It  has  even\r\n\r\ngone out of its way to get voluntary social workers\r\n\r\ninterested in this Home to give a helping hand.  In\r\n\r\nfact, before publicity was given in the press,  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  consulted  the  Singapore  Council   of\r\n\r\nSocial  Services,  which is the co-ordinating  body\r\n\r\nfor  such  private voluntary welfare organisations,\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  on the possible  need  to  make\r\n\r\nalternative arrangements for eventual placement  of\r\n\r\nthe old inmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report that the monk is running the home\r\n\r\nsingle-handed is not true, as he has employed seven\r\n\r\nworkers  to attend to the needs of the old  inmates\r\n\r\nand  to  keep the place clean and tidy. The  recent\r\n\r\noutburst  of publicity after so many years  of  the\r\n\r\nHome's existence is probably due to the realisation\r\n\r\nby  the monk in charge that the Home is in its last\r\n\r\nfew months of existence, in view of the forthcoming\r\n\r\nacquisition of the land for urban renewal purposes.\r\n\r\nBecause  of the imminent closure of this Home,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Social Affairs has recently  issued  a\r\n\r\npress statement advising members of the public, who\r\n\r\nwish  to make voluntary donations to this Home,  to\r\n\r\nsend  their  donations to the Singapore Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial Services indicating that the money should be\r\n\r\nused  for  the  benefit of the old people  of  this\r\n\r\nHome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the question of pocket money for\r\n\r\nthe  inmates of our homes, I have explained earlier\r\n\r\nthat  the majority of the inmates in the homes  are\r\n\r\npaying   cases,  financially  supported  by   their\r\n\r\nrelatives. The remaining cases as clarified earlier\r\n\r\nare  being looked after by the department under its\r\n\r\npublic   assistance  scheme,  and  they  are   paid\r\n\r\nwhatever allowance that they are eligible for, each\r\n\r\ncase  depending  on  its  own  merit.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nappreciated  that  the Poh Thong Sec  Buddhist  Old\r\n\r\nPeople's Home is a private home run on a commercial\r\n\r\nbasis,  and it is not the general practice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to give pocket money to the inmates  of\r\n\r\nsuch  private homes of which there are  several  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has asked about the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  the  Singapore  Council  of   Social\r\n\r\nServices  in the committee for revision  of  grants\r\n\r\nfor  all the voluntary organisations. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make  this  clear  - the Singapore  Council  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Services  is, in fact, a recipient  of  the\r\n\r\ngrant.  So  it is quite unwise to put the Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil of Social Services on the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have requested the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of  the  Singapore  Council  of   Social\r\n\r\nServices  on  the special committee  to  look  into\r\n\r\nGovernment    grants    to    various    charitable\r\n\r\norganisations.

The Council itself, if it is\r\n\r\na recipient, is not, I think what its name implies.\r\n\r\nIt is not a recipient in the same nature as another\r\n\r\nsociety  like the Society for Aid to the Paralysed,\r\n\r\nbecause the Council itself is a co-ordinating body,\r\n\r\ni.e, a  body that is responsible for co-ordinating\r\n\r\nthe  activities of various voluntary  organisations\r\n\r\ndoing  welfare  work. If the Government  recognises\r\n\r\nthe   role  of  the  Singapore  Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nServices as that of a co-ordinating body,  then  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  award of grants or  assistance  to\r\n\r\nvarious  such  bodies,  I think  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider  including this Council on that committee.\r\n\r\nThis is only a request, and I hope the Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary will  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, if the Singapore Council\r\n\r\nof  Social Services were to be the only parent body\r\n\r\nin  charge of all the voluntary organisations, then\r\n\r\nit  is all right to include it on the committee  to\r\n\r\nreview  aid to voluntary organisations.  But  there\r\n\r\nare  many  other organisations which  do  not  come\r\n\r\nwithin the scope of the Singapore Council of Social\r\n\r\nServices.  If  we  include  the  Council   on   the\r\n\r\ncommittee, then, firstly, it is very difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe  Council to face its members if the members  do\r\n\r\nnot  get any aid.

I  believe that this  committee  to\r\n\r\nreview  aid to voluntary organisations is  in  many\r\n\r\nways  a product of the Ministry of Finance, and  it\r\n\r\nis  well-known  to Council members that  in  actual\r\n\r\nfact even a senior official of the Finance Ministry\r\n\r\nwas  surprised to learn that the Singapore  Council\r\n\r\nof   Social  Services  was  not  included  in  this\r\n\r\ncommittee.  I take this opportunity once  again  to\r\n\r\nappeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other matters, Sir, first, I did also touch on\r\n\r\nthe  question of available facilities for the  care\r\n\r\nof the aged and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchronic  sick. I am afraid there was  no  reply  to\r\n\r\nthis   question.  Secondly,  with  regard  to   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of supervision or legislation  to  impose\r\n\r\nsome   degree   of  control  over   standards   and\r\n\r\nfacilities  provided for by various accredited  and\r\n\r\nnon-accredited welfare organisations, we  all  know\r\n\r\nthat there are a good number of homes that are  run\r\n\r\nby the Government and the standards are good. There\r\n\r\nare also a number of welfare organisations that are\r\n\r\ngrouped  under the Council of Social Services,  and\r\n\r\nthe  standards are also the minimum at  least.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are  also in existence in Singapore  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber     of    purportedly    called     \"welfare\r\n\r\norganisations\" when they are, in actual fact, money-making  organisations. I think something should  be\r\n\r\ndone  to control these organisations. If we do  not\r\n\r\nmove  in  this  direction, I am  afraid,  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  under-privileged  old  people  in   our\r\n\r\nsociety  who  are helpless will become subjects  of\r\n\r\nexploitation    by    these   so-called    \"welfare\r\n\r\norganisations\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I entirely agree with\r\n\r\nthe   view  of  the  Member  that  some   sort   of\r\n\r\ninvestigation should be carried out to  put  things\r\n\r\nright in respect of such dubious welfare homes.  In\r\n\r\nfact, they are mushrooming in Singapore. Of course,\r\n\r\npeople  who  do not want to look after  their  aged\r\n\r\nrelatives find it very convenient to send these old\r\n\r\npeople   to  such  homes.  There  is  no  condition\r\n\r\nattached  to  those people who send their  unwanted\r\n\r\nrelatives  to  these  homes. Aged  people  who  are\r\n\r\nadmitted into our homes have to conform to  certain\r\n\r\nconditions.  For example, they must be alone,  with\r\n\r\nno  relatives, and must be really poor. But in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of private welfare homes, some of the inmates\r\n\r\ncan  maintain  themselves, as  the  Member  himself\r\n\r\nknows,  and  they are paying as much  as  $180  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  But,  I  think some sort  of  investigation\r\n\r\nshould  be  done on this. In fact, I have discussed\r\n\r\nthis  with  my  officials  and  we  are  going   to\r\n\r\ninstitute  an investigation into this to  find  out\r\n\r\nhow many such homes there are in Singapore. Pending\r\n\r\nsuch findings, I cannot say anything more on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his reassurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Sir, sending the\r\n\r\nold  and aged people to such homes is, I think, the\r\n\r\nmodern  way  of  living. All these old  people  are\r\n\r\nfacing  a  lot  of  problems  and  difficulties.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  mentality of the  younger  generation\r\n\r\ntoday  is  that  they  prefer to  send  their  aged\r\n\r\nparents to the various homes. This is a modern  way\r\n\r\nof  living which we cannot escape. In view of this,\r\n\r\nI  would  strongly  urge the  Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  to consider the possibility of  a  project\r\n\r\nwhereby all old and aged people may be given decent\r\n\r\nplaces to live so that they can be well taken  care\r\n\r\nof, especially those who can afford to pay. This is\r\n\r\na  project  where  the Minister  can  give  certain\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember,  there is such a home now in  existence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that is the St. John's Home for  the\r\n\r\nAged.  The capital sum required to build  a  fairly\r\n\r\ncomfortable accommodation of flats or rooms costs a\r\n\r\nlot  of money. Unless that capital sum is found  by\r\n\r\nthe  voluntary  organisations themselves  -not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because I do not think  the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to have such homes built for  them.  I\r\n\r\nthink society has a responsibility towards the aged\r\n\r\npeople   in  these  days.  Furthermore,  with   the\r\n\r\nannouncement made by my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, of the $750 tax relief allowance  for  the\r\n\r\ncaring of aged parents, I hope this incentive  will\r\n\r\npersuade  the  people  to  look  after  their  aged\r\n\r\nrelatives and parents, rather than just put them in\r\n\r\nold people's homes, whether run by the State or  by\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  their replies, and I beg leave to withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head KB be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead AC 1201.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that creches for the care of\r\n\r\nchildren   are   essential  in  an   industrialised\r\n\r\nsociety,  especially when in our present  state  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation we are faced with a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour and are trying to recruit female labour  for\r\n\r\nour  factories. More creches should, therefore,  be\r\n\r\nset  up in the industrial estates. However,  it  is\r\n\r\none thing to set up more creches, and it is another\r\n\r\nthing  to  improve the facilities in these creches.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  the  creches  are  well-provided  but  the\r\n\r\nservice is not adequate or that it is not up to the\r\n\r\nexpectation of parents, the creches will only be  a\r\n\r\nwhite elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an open-house day for the creche in Jurong on\r\n\r\n5th  November last year, I made two suggestions  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the creche. The first suggestion was  that\r\n\r\nthe  creche should lengthen its opening  hours.  At\r\n\r\npresent the creche is open only up to 5 o'clock.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  opening hours can be longer in order  to\r\n\r\nhelp workers on shift duty, especially those living\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  area who work on second shift  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children will be looked after. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nthink creches should extend their opening hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion was that transport to the\r\n\r\ncreches   should  be  provided  for  the  children,\r\n\r\nbecause  during peak hours it is very  inconvenient\r\n\r\nfor  mothers to carry their children to the  creche\r\n\r\nand  then take a bus to the factories. If there  is\r\n\r\ntransport to send the children to the creche,  this\r\n\r\nwill  be most welcome to the parents, and more  and\r\n\r\nmore  parents  will  send  their  children  to  the\r\n\r\ncreche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether he has any intention to set up\r\n\r\nanother creche in Neighbourhood II in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I\r\n\r\ntoo, like the Member for Jurong, urge that the  few\r\n\r\ncreches   that   we  have  should  organise   their\r\n\r\nactivities in such a way that they will  cater  for\r\n\r\nthe  need of mothers who are engaged in shift work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   the   Ministry  of  Social   Affairs   in\r\n\r\ncollaboration with the People's Association, should\r\n\r\nalso look into the possibility of utilising to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum   the  facilities  and  the  infrastructure\r\n\r\navailable in the community centres in Singapore and\r\n\r\nin  the creches as well. In places where there  are\r\n\r\nno  creches, I believe the community centres  could\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  creches in the mornings and  even  at\r\n\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is: are there any plans to build\r\n\r\na  creche  in Telok Blangah?

This is a new complex  just\r\n\r\ncoming up, and I think there is the possibility  of\r\n\r\na  need for a creche there because an area there is\r\n\r\ngoing to be an industrial estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  talk on something about creches.

I would like  to  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs for the wonderful scheme in setting\r\n\r\nup  creches in Singapore. On the 16th of this month\r\n\r\nI  was  invited to the opening ceremony  of  a  new\r\n\r\ncreche in Kallang Bahru. I found that the place was\r\n\r\nvery  spacious, occupying about 10,000 sq, ft.  The\r\n\r\nfacilities  were  very  good  and  the  staff  were\r\n\r\npolite.  They are bound to look after the  children\r\n\r\nvery  well. Therefore, parents can be rest  assured\r\n\r\nwhen they entrust their children to such staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that more creches should be built in\r\n\r\nthe  various areas, for example, in Sembawang.

I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is important that employers,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  investors who run factories, must themselves\r\n\r\nplay  an important part. If they want employees  to\r\n\r\nwork in their factories, it is high time they built\r\n\r\nsmall creches in their various factories. If  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken, they have such facilities in  Japan.\r\n\r\nSo it is high time they did something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport   all   those  Members  who   praised   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of creches. I should say  that  wider\r\n\r\npublicity  should  be  given  by  the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nencourage the women to leave their children in  the\r\n\r\ncreches and go to work. At the moment the hours for\r\n\r\nmothers to put the children in the creches are very\r\n\r\nunrealistic. I should say that it caters purely for\r\n\r\nthe  majority of office workers or teachers. It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that some housewives would want  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to these creches so that they could\r\n\r\ngo out to play mahjong. We have to change the hours\r\n\r\nto  suit  the  shift workers. If we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nencourage  married women with children to  work  in\r\n\r\nindustrial concerns on shift duty, I think we  have\r\n\r\nto  change the opening hours of the creche. Instead\r\n\r\nof opening at 8 am., it should be 7.30 a.m, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  have  time to put the  children  in  the\r\n\r\ncreche and go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, in reply to the matters raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong.  I am glad to say, Sir, that  the  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions  made by him are being looked  into  by\r\n\r\nthe Social Welfare Department. As for the extension\r\n\r\nof  hours of opening of the creche, the Member  may\r\n\r\nbe  pleased  to  know  that,  though  the  official\r\n\r\nclosing time of the Jurong Town creche is 5.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.m., parents have been allowed to come back to the\r\n\r\ncreche  to collect their children as late  as  6.30\r\n\r\np.m, or even 7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a survey is being conducted to find\r\n\r\nout  ways  and means to improve the facilities  and\r\n\r\nservices available in the creches. The results  and\r\n\r\nfindings  of the survey, which include  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  creche, will determine whether it is feasible\r\n\r\nto consider an extension of the hours of opening of\r\n\r\ncreches   and  the  service  of  transporting   the\r\n\r\nchildren  to  the  creches.  However,  such   extra\r\n\r\nservices  can  only  be carried  out  if  there  is\r\n\r\nsufficient  response from the parents, the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department was most disappointed when  the\r\n\r\nextension  of creche hours at the Toa Payoh  creche\r\n\r\nmet with very poor response. As creche services are\r\n\r\nvery  heavily  subsidised by  the  Government,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong will appreciate that unless there\r\n\r\nis  ample  response,  it will not  be  feasible  to\r\n\r\nextend the opening hours of the creche for the sake\r\n\r\nof   a   handful  of  children.  Furthermore,   any\r\n\r\nprovision  of  transport services for children,  if\r\n\r\nfound  necessary eventually, will have to be  borne\r\n\r\nby  the  parents  concerned, as the  Government  is\r\n\r\nalready   very  heavily  subsidising   the   creche\r\n\r\nservices  rendered to each child  who  attends  the\r\n\r\ncreche every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department has made enquiries\r\n\r\nfrom  parents  using the Jurong  Town  creche,  and\r\n\r\nlearned  that  only  five  parents  have   so   far\r\n\r\nexpressed   the  need  for  transport   for   their\r\n\r\nchildren. The result of the survey presently  being\r\n\r\nconducted  will decide whether the need to  provide\r\n\r\ntransport  facilities  is  justified  or  not.  The\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department maintains that it  would\r\n\r\nbe  pointless to arrange for a NTUC van or bus with\r\n\r\na  capacity of 20 to 30 children to carry just 6 to\r\n\r\n8 children who require transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a second creche in Jurong Town, Sir, he\r\n\r\nwill  be  pleased  to know that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nplanning,   with   very  close   co-operation   and\r\n\r\nassistance of the Jurong Town Corporation, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild one more creche in Jurong Town, most probably\r\n\r\nin  Neighbourhood  II.  The department  is  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment   actively   consulting  the   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  on this matter, and it is  hoped  that\r\n\r\nthis  second creche in Jurong Town will materialise\r\n\r\nsoon  and will be a boon to the mothers working  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  Sir, he is right in putting up  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  establishment of more creches,  not  only\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view of promoting child welfare,\r\n\r\nbut  because we must actively encourage more  women\r\n\r\nto  take  up  full-time employment to overcome  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  labour.  In  fact,  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  is  to  build  more creches  especially  in\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, where there is a demand for  such\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Creches  will be  established  in  the\r\n\r\nmajor  housing  estates built by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board as part of its social services to\r\n\r\nresidents  therein and to people either  living  or\r\n\r\nworking  near these estates. As such, there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  make provision in the Estimates  for\r\n\r\nthe building of creches. The normal practice is for\r\n\r\nthe   HDB  to  build  creches  within  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  Once  the  creches are  built,  they  are\r\n\r\nrented  out to the Social Welfare Department  which\r\n\r\nwill  provide  the creche service. If  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  need  for creches to  be  established\r\n\r\noutside the housing estate, then provision will  be\r\n\r\nsought in the Estimates for the creche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be pleased to know that the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department is now negotiating with the  HDB\r\n\r\nfor  a  new creche to be built in the Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nNew  Town.  The  Government  is  also  planning  to\r\n\r\nestablish  creches in other Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  estates  where there is a high concentration\r\n\r\nof  working  mothers for the benefit of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible, Sir, to use the community\r\n\r\ncentres  and  their facilities for the  running  of\r\n\r\ncreches.  The Member, I am sure, is well  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  intensive use of community centre  facilities.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, creches should be specially designed\r\n\r\nwith special equipment and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities  to cater for very young children,  from\r\n\r\nbabies of a few months old to children of six years\r\n\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee has rightly\r\n\r\nmentioned, Sir, that private concerns should play a\r\n\r\npart  in  making  available more  creches  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  workers.  This  is  an  area   of\r\n\r\ncommunity welfare in which the private sector,  the\r\n\r\nfactories     and    industrial    and     business\r\n\r\nestablishments,   can   play   a    part,    either\r\n\r\nindividually or jointly with others. Commercial and\r\n\r\nindustrial  establishments  can  set  up   creches,\r\n\r\nwhether  big  or  small, as part of  their  welfare\r\n\r\nfacilities   for  their  staff.   This   helps   to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  job-hopping and ensure that  investment\r\n\r\non  the  skill  given to female  employees  is  not\r\n\r\nwasted  when they stop work just because they  have\r\n\r\nchildren to look after at home. In my recent  visit\r\n\r\nto   factories  to  encourage  the  employment   of\r\n\r\nhandicapped  persons,  I raised  this  question  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  creches with many  employers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector. The response from the employers was\r\n\r\nencouraging,   and  some  of  them   have   already\r\n\r\ncontacted   the   Social  Welfare  Department   for\r\n\r\nassistance in creche planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 would like to thank the Member for Sembawang,\r\n\r\nSir,  for his compliment on the newly opened creche\r\n\r\nat  Kallang Bahru. In fact, I was told that he  was\r\n\r\nthe   first  person  to  register  his  child   for\r\n\r\nadmission to the creche.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nBoon  Teck,  the hours of all creches in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  from  7 a.m, to 6 p.m. I think this  is  quite\r\n\r\nfair  to both working mothers and mothers who  want\r\n\r\nto play mahjong, as he has put it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in line\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government's policy on family  planning,\r\n\r\ndoes  the  Minister not think there is a  need  for\r\n\r\nthese  creches to introduce rules saying  that  for\r\n\r\nthose  mothers  with  more  than  two  children  an\r\n\r\nincreased  fee will be charged if they  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to these creches?

For\r\n\r\ninstance, for this month, a shift worker  may  work\r\n\r\nin the morning shift, but next month when she is on\r\n\r\nnight  shift, she may also want to put her children\r\n\r\nin  the creche. So my request is whether the  hours\r\n\r\ncan  be  lengthened so that those who work  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon shift or in the night shift can also send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to the creches. At this  moment,  I\r\n\r\nshould say that the response in Toa Payoh is  good.\r\n\r\nI  must  compliment the people running the  creche,\r\n\r\nfor they are doing a good job. What I would like to\r\n\r\nsay is: can we maximise the use of these creches so\r\n\r\nthat  all  industrial workers who are married  with\r\n\r\nchildren can make use of these facilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in reply to my remarks the Minister said that\r\n\r\nthere  was  a survey on the need for transport  and\r\n\r\nthat  the response was not very good. What I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out to him is that those people  who\r\n\r\nmake  use  of the creche in Jurong Town at  present\r\n\r\neither live near the creche or they may have  their\r\n\r\nown  transport  arrangements. But  those  who  have\r\n\r\ntransport problems have not been able to send their\r\n\r\nchildren  to the creche. And I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  any  response from such  people  to  the\r\n\r\nsurvey. I would suggest to the Minister that if  at\r\n\r\nall  a  survey is to be conducted, it should  be  a\r\n\r\nthorough survey covering other people living in the\r\n\r\narea  so  as  to reflect the actual  needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I want to thank the\r\n\r\nMember  for Boon Teck for his suggestion.

The  Robinson  fire\r\n\r\nwas  the worst, where innocent lives were lost.  If\r\n\r\nsufficient safety precautions had been taken,  such\r\n\r\na  monstrous disaster could not have resulted.  But\r\n\r\nthat is the past, and from this single fire, we can\r\n\r\nlearn  a  lesson.  May  I ask  at  this  time  what\r\n\r\ncompulsory  measures  have been  imposed  on  large\r\n\r\ndepartmental  stores  where  many  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  patronise,  so that we may  not  experience\r\n\r\nanother \"Robinson fire\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been complaints of cases where\r\n\r\nthe  hoses leak and the fire engines arriving late.\r\n\r\nSurely we cannot boast of an efficient fire service\r\n\r\nif  the  hoses  leak  when connected  to  the  fire\r\n\r\nengines or to the hydrants. If that is the case,  a\r\n\r\nfour-gallon pail of water is a more efficient fire-fighting  equipment than a fire engine which  comes\r\n\r\nlate  and with hoses that leak. What is being  done\r\n\r\nwith  the  fire service to up-date it  with  modern\r\n\r\nequipment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-fighting equipment installed in many\r\n\r\nestablishments  serve as very nice  decorations  in\r\n\r\nthose  places. Even though they are there, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the Fire Service can insist that  all  the\r\n\r\nstaff   are   taught   to  use  the   fire-fighting\r\n\r\nequipment. Nothing is more disastrous than seeing a\r\n\r\nfactory go up in flames, when at the initial stages\r\n\r\nthe  flames  could have been controlled or  stopped\r\n\r\nfrom  spreading  by using the simple  fire-fighting\r\n\r\nequipment installed in the factory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, may I draw attention to the fact\r\n\r\nthat  some of our schools are hardly equipped  with\r\n\r\nany fire-fighting equipment. Even if there are fire\r\n\r\nextinguishers around, the teachers do not even know\r\n\r\nhow to use them. Do we have to have a disaster on a\r\n\r\nscale  larger than the Robinson fire to prove  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a lack of fire-fighting service  in  our\r\n\r\nschools?  I  wonder whether this  Ministry  is  co-operating with the Ministry of Education over  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late\r\n\r\nwe  have  read in the press quite a lot  about  the\r\n\r\nunderstaffing   position  in  the   Fire   Brigade,\r\n\r\nindicating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  working  only  with  60  per  cent\r\n\r\nstrength.  Despite the limitation  in  manpower,  I\r\n\r\nmust say that they have performed their duties very\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the turnover rate of staff in the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  is also very great, and the main complaint\r\n\r\nseems to be that the fireman`s salary scale is very\r\n\r\npoor.  It is time that something was done  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  question  of their remuneration.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  the  fireman's job carries as much  risk  as\r\n\r\nthat  of  a  policeman. In the case of the  Police,\r\n\r\nthere  was  the  Lee Soo Ann Commission  which  had\r\n\r\nended increments of salaries and In the case of the\r\n\r\nFire Brigade are we not going to do something about\r\n\r\nit? Are we going to step up the recruitment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the Fire Service is this. I\r\n\r\nthink it was only last week that our attention  was\r\n\r\ndrawn  to  a  fairly serious fire  in  one  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats.  I  remember  watching   the\r\n\r\nincident  on television. The building is  a  fairly\r\n\r\nlow-rise  flat, about five storeys  high,  and  the\r\n\r\nfiremen  were fighting the fire from  a  ladder.  I\r\n\r\nwonder what will happen if a fire should occur in a\r\n\r\nblock of flats 20 storeys high. I do not think  the\r\n\r\nladder  is  going to reach that height. What  about\r\n\r\nthe  water  pressure? How is it going to reach  all\r\n\r\nthe  way up to the top? I do not know when was  the\r\n\r\nlast  time  all  the Housing Board flats  were  put\r\n\r\nunder close examination to make sure that the fire-fighting facilities are adequate and that the water\r\n\r\npressure is sufficient to go up to the top  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding. I think the highest building in Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nis more than 20 storeys high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the exits? In the case of private\r\n\r\nbuildings the present requirements for fire-escapes\r\n\r\nand emergency exits are very stringent. However, in\r\n\r\nthe  case of the Housing Board flats, we do not see\r\n\r\nany  fire-escapes at all. What will happen if there\r\n\r\nshould  be a fire in a high-rise block of flats  in\r\n\r\none of our housing estates? What will happen then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of modernisation of our equipment.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  Development Estimates there are provisions for\r\n\r\nfire tenders. But how up-to-date are these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfire  tenders?  Moreover, are we sending  our  fire\r\n\r\nofficers  abroad  to learn more  about  the  latest\r\n\r\ntechniques of fire-fighting? With the tendency  for\r\n\r\nbuildings to go higher and higher, there has been a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to  make  use of  helicopters.  Are  we\r\n\r\nlooking  into this matter? There are a hundred  and\r\n\r\none suggestions one can think of. As the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson has pointed out earlier on, the Robinson fire\r\n\r\nhas  certainly opened our eyes. I think we will  be\r\n\r\nfailing  in  our duty if we do not  look  into  all\r\n\r\nthese areas fairly promptly. I would certainly urge\r\n\r\nthat  every attention be paid to the safety of  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. Although I do not have Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  in my constituency at the  moment,  I\r\n\r\nshall  have  them  very  soon  as  they  are  under\r\n\r\nconstruction.  Therefore, I feel  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter which concerns me as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nFire Brigade has always insisted on a high standard\r\n\r\nof  fire  preventive measures in buildings, whether\r\n\r\nthey be private or public buildings or whether  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  a  block  of  Housing  Board   flats.\r\n\r\nPreviously  the  Housing Board was responsible  for\r\n\r\nprescribing  and  enforcing  such  requirements  in\r\n\r\ntheir  buildings on behalf of the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision.  The  recommendations made  by  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  would ensure that in the event of a  fire,\r\n\r\nprotected   staircases  would   be   available   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate evacuation and that the construction  of\r\n\r\nfire walls would minimise the possibility of a wild\r\n\r\nfire  involving the entire building. All  buildings\r\n\r\nthat  would be frequented by members of the  public\r\n\r\nare   also  required  to  install  automatic   fire\r\n\r\ndetection  systems connected to fire stations,  and\r\n\r\nin-built  fire-fighting facilities, such as  risers\r\n\r\nand  hose  rails, were prescribed for all buildings\r\n\r\nfor the use of firemen in an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson may wish to know that the\r\n\r\nRobinsons  building which he mentioned was  erected\r\n\r\nin  1910,  and it was not built in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  current regulations governing fire  protection\r\n\r\nmeasures.   The  fire  precautionary  measures   in\r\n\r\nRobinsons  building  were  clearly  inadequate   by\r\n\r\npresent-day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards.  The  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the\r\n\r\nRobinson's  Fire  was satisfied that  the  building\r\n\r\ncould  not  have been saved by the  time  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade was summoned. The fire had been allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe   nursed  in  the  loft  stores  without   being\r\n\r\ndetected, and the fire-fighting squad was  fighting\r\n\r\nthe fire at the wrong location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the leaking hoses, the Member may\r\n\r\nwish  to know that a certain amount of leaking  was\r\n\r\nintended in certain types of hoses to saturate  the\r\n\r\nhose  jacket and to protect the hoses from catching\r\n\r\nfire.  Both  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  and   my\r\n\r\nMinistry  are satisfied that the Fire  Brigade  has\r\n\r\nmaintained its forces well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint that fire-engines\r\n\r\nsometimes  arrive late, may I point out that  these\r\n\r\nallegations   have  never  been  proven.   On   the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  our  records show that the  Brigade  has\r\n\r\nalways  responded  promptly to fire-calls.  Perhaps\r\n\r\npeople  in  distress are often prone to  over-react\r\n\r\nand exaggerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may also wish to know that the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade is ready at any time to educate members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  in fire-fighting and fire  prevention.\r\n\r\nSince  the  beginning of this year the Brigade  has\r\n\r\ngiven  lectures  to  youth  organisations,  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes,  Government and quasi-Government bodies  and\r\n\r\nindustrial   concerns  on  13  separate  occasions.\r\n\r\nApproximately  200 school children  and  industrial\r\n\r\nworkers   visited  the  fire  stations   and   were\r\n\r\nentertained to a demonstration of fire-drills, fire-fighting  and rescue exercises. Through  the  years\r\n\r\nthe  Brigade  has  been advising  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  on  fire  protection  measures  in   the\r\n\r\nschools.   The   Brigade  has  also  planned   some\r\n\r\nprogrammes on fire education for the schools, which\r\n\r\nwould include lectures, exhibitions, film shows and\r\n\r\nfire-drills.  We hope to implement such  programmes\r\n\r\nduring the course of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether the equipment for fire-fighting in high-rise buildings is adequate or not,\r\n\r\nI am happy to affirm that the Brigade is equipped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  fight fires in high-rise buildings. The Brigade\r\n\r\nhas  a total of 37 modern fire-fighting appliances,\r\n\r\n27  of  these appliances can each pump 500 to 1,000\r\n\r\ngallons  of  water per minute at a reasonably  high\r\n\r\npressure.  The  Brigade is also equipped  with  two\r\n\r\nmechanical ladders reaching a maximum height of 100\r\n\r\nfeet  and  one hydraulic platform of 65 feet  high.\r\n\r\nThe   upper  floors  of  high-rise  buildings   are\r\n\r\nobviously   above  the  range  of  this  equipment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the modern method of extinguishing  fires\r\n\r\nin  high-rise buildings is to fight the fires  from\r\n\r\nwithin.  No mechanical ladder in the world is  high\r\n\r\nenough to reach levels above 150 feet or so. Hence,\r\n\r\nthe   Fire  Brigade  has  previously  insisted   on\r\n\r\nstringent  fire  protection measures  in  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.  However, this function has  been  taken\r\n\r\nover  by  the Building Control Division  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development since 1st  August,\r\n\r\n1973.  With effect from 1st April, 1974, all  other\r\n\r\nfive  regulatory functions, including the licensing\r\n\r\nof  dangerous  trades, will be transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nsame authority, so that henceforth the Fire Brigade\r\n\r\nwill be able to concentrate on fire-fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of use of helicopters, this is\r\n\r\nbeing  discussed by the Ministry with the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence.  The use of helicopters  is  more  for\r\n\r\nrescue than fighting fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the shortage of staff in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Fire Brigade, I am happy  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House that the Ministry's negotiation with the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Union of Public Employees on the salary\r\n\r\nrevision  of the Fire Service has been successfully\r\n\r\nconcluded. I have the new salary scales  here  but,\r\n\r\nbecause  of lack of time, I am not able  to  inform\r\n\r\nMembers  of the full details. But if they  like,  I\r\n\r\ncan  circulate  it  to them for their  information.\r\n\r\nSir,  it is common knowledge that the salaries  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service in the Singapore Fire Brigade\r\n\r\nare  not  as  attractive as those  offered  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  There  were  few  incentives   to\r\n\r\nattract  good  recruits into the  service  and  the\r\n\r\nBrigade   also   found  it  difficult   to   retain\r\n\r\nexperienced  and  promising  officers.   This   was\r\n\r\nespecially so during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   past   three  years  when   the   growth   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  in the Republic  created  golden\r\n\r\nopportunities for experienced fire officers to join\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector as fire and  safety  officers.\r\n\r\nSuch  careers  in  the  industries  offered  better\r\n\r\nsalaries and were less hazardous than the job of  a\r\n\r\nfire officer in the Singapore Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of staff is also due to crimping by\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  Last year  alone,  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  lost one divisional officer, one assistant\r\n\r\ndivisional  officer and eight station officers  who\r\n\r\nwere top people in the service to the shipyards and\r\n\r\npetroleum  companies. In the public interest,  such\r\n\r\ncrimping  must cease. The firms should  employ  new\r\n\r\nstaff  instead of taking experienced  officers  and\r\n\r\nmen from the Brigade. The Brigade would be only too\r\n\r\npleased to assist in giving the needed training  to\r\n\r\nthem,  if  necessary. Whatever it is,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped that with the new salary revision of the Fire\r\n\r\nService  we  will be able to retain our experienced\r\n\r\nmen  and  attract more candidates of  fine  calibre\r\n\r\ninto the service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, the point on fire safety\r\n\r\nat  Housing  Board  flats  is  still  bothering  me\r\n\r\nbecause there have been a number of fires in flats.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering whether the Fire Brigade cannot\r\n\r\nwork  together  with  the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard. The staff of the Fire Brigade would have had\r\n\r\nsome  experience. They would have investigated  and\r\n\r\ncome  to  certain conclusions, and  perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nabout time that they made a thorough survey to find\r\n\r\nout  whether or not the existing facilities in  all\r\n\r\nthese  flats  are,  in fact, adequate.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nparticularly   concerned   are   those    high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.  I  do  appreciate  that  there  are  no\r\n\r\nladders  high  enough to go up to the  20th  storey\r\n\r\nand,   therefore,  fighting  a  fire  in  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings is to fight it from within. But the point\r\n\r\nis  that  if  within  the  building  there  are  no\r\n\r\nadequate  facilities, then how are  they  going  to\r\n\r\nfight the fire? They cannot fight from without  and\r\n\r\nthey cannot fight from within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of adequate exits, fire escapes\r\n\r\nand  so on, I think none of the Housing Board flats\r\n\r\nhas got\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemergency fire exits, extra staircase, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Secondly, when there  is  a  fire,\r\n\r\nvehicles  on the road must make way for  the  fire-engines, because if there is a traffic jam the fire-engines cannot go through.

The   Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  has  put up quite a number of  suggestions\r\n\r\nand recommendations which are now being studied  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development. We  have  to\r\n\r\nwait and see what action will be taken by the other\r\n\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question raised by the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nthe hoses are checked and maintained, not every now\r\n\r\nand then but everyday. But, as I have said, certain\r\n\r\ntypes of hoses must be allowed to leak a little  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  hoses are saturated and that keeps  them\r\n\r\ncool and prevent them from getting burnt. In a  big\r\n\r\nfire,  the  heat is tremendous and  some  hoses  do\r\n\r\ncatch fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of traffic jams and the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  drivers  should  be  told   that,\r\n\r\nwhenever  a  fire-engine is answering a call,  they\r\n\r\nshould  keep  to the side and allow the fire-engine\r\n\r\nto pass through, the fire-engines are equipped with\r\n\r\nvery  loud-sounding sirens. Every driver knows that\r\n\r\nhe has to give way to the fire-engine.

In the meantime,\r\n\r\nI would plead with him to he a little more patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  explanation and assurance,  I  beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,545,790 for Head KC ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,433,200 for Head KC ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a resolution of the House, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker  thereupon left the Chair of the  Committee\r\n\r\nand took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I beg to report that\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply has made further progress\r\n\r\non the Main and Development Estimates of Expendi-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nture for the financial year 1st April, 1974 to 31st\r\n\r\nMarch, 1975, and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" --[Encik Othman Bin Wok].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Two minutes</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
