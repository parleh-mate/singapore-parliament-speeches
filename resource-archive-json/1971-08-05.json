It  now   has   overseas\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   in  Indonesia,   the   U.S.S.R.,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  West Germany, Holland,  South  Vietnam\r\n\r\nand  Cambodia all this with the aim of helping  to\r\n\r\npromote  and sell Singapore-made goods.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an Export Promotion Advisory Committee in the\r\n\r\nTrade   Division  of  the  Ministry  of   Finance.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives   from  the  joint   Chambers   of\r\n\r\nCommerce,     the     Singapore     Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation, Intraco, and the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard, sit on this Committee, the main function of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to advise on participation by Singapore\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and exporters in international fairs\r\n\r\noverseas.  With  the encouragement and  assistance\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Trade Division, our  manufacturers\r\n\r\nparticipated in the Jetro Fair held  in  Tokyo  in\r\n\r\nApril  this  year, and at the present  moment  are\r\n\r\nparticipating   in   the   Djakarta   Fair.    The\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  will  also be taking  part  in  the\r\n\r\n\"Partners for Progress Exhibition\" to be  held  in\r\n\r\nBerlin in October this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa himself led a large\r\n\r\nmission to Tokyo in connection with the Jetro Fair\r\n\r\nlast April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience gained in the participation of\r\n\r\ntrade  fairs  and missions abroad, action  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing   taken  to  expand  the  Export   Promotion\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee so that it will be better  able\r\n\r\nto  serve  the  promotion and sale  of  our  goods\r\n\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Export financing is intimately tied up with\r\n\r\nexport  promotion. At present,  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nexport financing is through short-term trade bills\r\n\r\nfinanced by our commercial banks. A careful  study\r\n\r\nwas  made  on  an Export Guarantee  Scheme  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  some  time ago but its introduction  was\r\n\r\nfound to be inadvisable at the moment. At present,\r\n\r\nshort-term financing is not a serious problem  but\r\n\r\nwhen  we start exporting more sophisticated  goods\r\n\r\nand  capital  equipment, long-term  finance  would\r\n\r\nthen become more urgent. My Ministry is keeping .a\r\n\r\nclose  watch on this matter and we are  exercising\r\n\r\nour minds in devising a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa also asked whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  help to identify  limited  areas\r\n\r\nwhere   local  capital  and  enterprise   can   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  go  into. My  Ministry  will  give\r\n\r\nconsideration to this suggestion. Where the market\r\n\r\nis   entirely   local,   there   appears   to   be\r\n\r\njustification in trying to obtain at least a share\r\n\r\nfor local capital and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that the 10 per cent\r\n\r\ntax  on  P.U.B, bills is a regressive tax. It  may\r\n\r\ninterest  him  to know, however,  that  more  than\r\n\r\n115,000 out of a total of 320,000 accounts do  not\r\n\r\npay  the 10 per cent tax because they consume less\r\n\r\nthan $13 a month. These represent some 36 per cent\r\n\r\nof the total number of accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised the question of\r\n\r\ncement  shortage.  My Ministry  is  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and  has  requested Intraco  to  import\r\n\r\n60,000  metric tons of cement, the first  shipment\r\n\r\nof  which is scheduled to arrive in about a week's\r\n\r\ntime,  and the second shipment of 10,000  tons  by\r\n\r\nabout  the  end of this month. Further, the  three\r\n\r\ncement   manufacturers  have  been  requested   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  minimum levels of production  to  ensure\r\n\r\nadequate  future  supply. We are keeping  a  close\r\n\r\nwatch  on  the  situation, and,  if  it  warrants,\r\n\r\nfurther imports by Intraco will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, together with the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Ho Swee, also raised the question\r\n\r\nof price increases. This subject was thoroughly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebated  during the budget debate  in  March  this\r\n\r\nyear.  During  that debate, Members were  informed\r\n\r\nthat,  because of the openness of our economy  and\r\n\r\nbecause  we  import almost everything we  use  and\r\n\r\nconsume,  we  are very much dependent  upon  world\r\n\r\nprices,  and that in recent years there  has  been\r\n\r\nworldwide  inflation, especially in the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries.  What we can do to help  is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   there  is  an  efficient  port   and   that\r\n\r\ncompetition in Singapore is free, so that we could\r\n\r\nimport at the cheapest price, and that there is no\r\n\r\nmonopoly   which  could  artificially   manipulate\r\n\r\nprices to the detriment of the consuming public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, a Consumers' Association has been\r\n\r\nformed,  and  this Association, which  works  very\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the Trade Division of my  Ministry,\r\n\r\nhas  been able to exert considerable influence  on\r\n\r\nthe  price level. The Trade Division on  its  part\r\n\r\nhas  been  giving  considerable encouragement  and\r\n\r\nhelp  to  the Consumers' Association and has  been\r\n\r\nsending out inspectors to check on prices whenever\r\n\r\nthere   is  report  of  any  unjustifiable   price\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, would like to emphasise\r\n\r\nthe  positive side of encouraging competition  and\r\n\r\nfair  prices  rather  than the  negative  side  of\r\n\r\nregulation  and  control.  One  of  the  ways   of\r\n\r\nencouraging traders to sell at fair prices  is  to\r\n\r\ngive these traders maximum publicity. This we hope\r\n\r\nto  do  by  enlisting the help of hon. Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House. This is what we are going to do:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inspectorate of the Trade Division, in their\r\n\r\nrounds  of  price checking, have come across  many\r\n\r\nshopkeepers who sell at fair prices. In  fact,  it\r\n\r\ncan  be said that unscrupulous traders who are out\r\n\r\nto  make a fast buck is the exception rather  than\r\n\r\nthe rule. This is also confirmed by the Consumers'\r\n\r\nAssociation.  What  we  are  going  to  do  is  to\r\n\r\npublicise the names of these traders who  sell  at\r\n\r\nfair  and reasonable prices by putting their names\r\n\r\non  a notice board in the community centres of the\r\n\r\nareas concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  hon.  Members can help by giving the  fullest\r\n\r\npublicity  to what we are going to do.  This  free\r\n\r\npublicity will give fair and reasonable traders  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge  over  the  others,   and   will\r\n\r\nencourage other traders to follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer himself can help in maintaining\r\n\r\nstable prices. He should keep himself informed and\r\n\r\nsee  whether  there are substitutes  for  what  he\r\n\r\nwants  to  buy. I think an example will make  this\r\n\r\nclear.  When the Public Utilities Board  announced\r\n\r\nsome time ago that there would be a possibility of\r\n\r\nwater rationing, people rushed to buy plastic tubs\r\n\r\nfor  the  storage of water. Because of this  rush,\r\n\r\nthe  price  of plastic tubs went up two  to  three\r\n\r\ntimes  overnight. The rush, however, was  entirely\r\n\r\nunnecessary because the P.U.B, did say that  ample\r\n\r\nnotice  would  be given before the  imposition  of\r\n\r\nwater  rationing. Furthermore, people should  have\r\n\r\nfound  out  whether  there  were  substitutes  for\r\n\r\nplastic  tubs for the storage of water. If  people\r\n\r\nhad not rushed all at once to buy plastic tubs, or\r\n\r\nif they had looked for substitutes, then the price\r\n\r\nof  plastic tubs would not have gone up, at  least\r\n\r\nwould   not  have  gone  up  two  or  three  times\r\n\r\novernight.  The  price  of plastic  tubs  has  now\r\n\r\ndropped  back  to its original level  because  the\r\n\r\ndemand for them has eased. Those who panicked  and\r\n\r\nrushed  to  buy plastic tubs at exorbitant  prices\r\n\r\nhad only themselves to blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  believes  that  with  a  well-informed\r\n\r\nconsuming  public and efficient port services  and\r\n\r\nfree competition in Singapore, we would be able to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a stable price level for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nus all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to associate myself\r\n\r\nwith  the  motion thanking the President  for  the\r\n\r\nspeech  which  he  delivered  on  behalf  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment at the opening of the Second Session of\r\n\r\nthis Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  in support of the motion standing in  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the  hon.  Member for  Ulu  Pandan,  and\r\n\r\nproposing  a  vote of thanks to the President  for\r\n\r\nthe  speech that he has delivered on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worker in Singapore, whether a citizen or\r\n\r\notherwise,  can exert considerable influence,  for\r\n\r\nbetter or for worse, on matters pertaining to  the\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  the  nation at  large.  In  order,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  for him to earn a fair  share  of  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of prosperity, he has to exert himself  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  achievement  of  the  optimum\r\n\r\neconomic growth as a condition precedent  for  any\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, the Employment Act was enacted in order\r\n\r\nto  create  a  favourable investment  climate  for\r\n\r\nSingapore, in anticipation of and preparation  for\r\n\r\nthe crucial years ahead. We in the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion   Congress  have  accepted  the   unpleasant\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  if  Singapore  did  not   become\r\n\r\neconomically viable, the bells will toll first for\r\n\r\nthe organised labour. Although we detested certain\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  the  Employment Act as  restrictive,\r\n\r\nnonetheless we accepted the underlying  objectives\r\n\r\nof  the Act,, that is, the curbing of malpractices\r\n\r\nand  the  creation of a more favourable industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  climate to attract foreign investments.\r\n\r\nThe  consequences  of any other alternative  would\r\n\r\nnot only be more painful, but also disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent events proved that, on the whole, it\r\n\r\nwas a right decision taken by the N.T.U.C, leaders\r\n\r\nin  accepting the Employment Act as inevitable and\r\n\r\ninfinitely  more  desirable than  the  chaos  that\r\n\r\nwould  have  resulted if the problems  of  growing\r\n\r\nunemployment had not been checked in  1968  before\r\n\r\nthey   posed   a  serious  threat  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Not  only  were  a  general   economic\r\n\r\ndepression  and massive unemployment averted,  but\r\n\r\nan  extraordinary industrial development was  also\r\n\r\ngenerated,  giving rise to boom conditions  and  a\r\n\r\nserious labour shortage in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel with, and equally as impressive as, the\r\n\r\neconomic  development  is the  significant  social\r\n\r\nprogress that has taken place in Singapore  during\r\n\r\nthe   past  six  years.  Social  progress  is  not\r\n\r\nautomatically  a  consequence of economic  growth,\r\n\r\neven when the rate of such growth is exceptionally\r\n\r\nhigh.  Despite  favourable  growth  records,  many\r\n\r\ncountries  in  Asia have greater unemployment  now\r\n\r\nthan  a decade ago, and millions of their citizens\r\n\r\nstill   lack  educational  opportunities,  despite\r\n\r\nheavy  investment in educational facilities. These\r\n\r\nproblems  are  compounded by the rapid  growth  in\r\n\r\npopulation  which in itself is swallowing  a  vast\r\n\r\namount  of  the  additional capital  generated  by\r\n\r\neconomic development. Millions live in poverty and\r\n\r\ndo not even enjoy the minimum degree of well-being\r\n\r\nand security compatible with human dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Singapore has not only\r\n\r\nbrought  population growth under control, but  has\r\n\r\nalso   achieved   a  situation  of   nearly   full\r\n\r\nemployment. Our social amenities such as  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing,  educational and medical facilities,  and\r\n\r\ncommunication services are among the best  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  and  comparable to any part of the  world.\r\n\r\nOur  educational system, after decades of colonial\r\n\r\ninertia, has now been oriented and geared  to  our\r\n\r\nmanpower  needs. There are parks  and  gardens  to\r\n\r\nmake for a more gracious living. We may yet attain\r\n\r\nin  the near future, as the Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\nhas so wished, a gracious way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, a combination of so many factors has\r\n\r\nbeen   responsible   for  our  relative   economic\r\n\r\naffluence, social order and political stability at\r\n\r\npresent. No less important than any factor is  the\r\n\r\npart played by labour in the success of our socio-economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the N.T.U.C, made it clear in 1968, when\r\n\r\naccepting the Employment Act, that we did  so  not\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of  enriching  the  pockets  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  but  for the purpose of  ensuring  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  our industrial expansion;  first,  to\r\n\r\novercome  the growing unemployment situation,  and\r\n\r\nthen  to  raise  the standard  of  living  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the Government is\r\n\r\nconscious of the sacrifices and contributions made\r\n\r\nby  labour to rapid economic growth and has  urged\r\n\r\nemployers  making  exceptional  profits  to   give\r\n\r\nbetter  bonuses to their workers. The announcement\r\n\r\nby  the  Government to review the prevailing  wage\r\n\r\npolicy, after the full effects of the run-down  of\r\n\r\nthe  British bases have been assessed, is  also  a\r\n\r\nwelcome move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not doubting the sincerity of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to improve the general wage\r\n\r\nlevel  in the best possible way at the right time,\r\n\r\nI cannot help' having a strong suspicion that some\r\n\r\nemployers may not take kindly to such a  move  and\r\n\r\nwill  do their best to thwart it under one pretext\r\n\r\nand  another.  It is, most conceivable  that  such\r\n\r\nemployers  will  attempt  to  equate  any   upward\r\n\r\nrevision  of  the  wage  level  with  terms   like\r\n\r\n\"inflation\",   and  advance  the   argument   that\r\n\r\n\"prohibitive    labour   costs\"    would    damage\r\n\r\nSingapore's   congenial   climate   for    foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very recent example of such an unhealthy\r\n\r\nattitude  of  some  employers, is  the  atavistic\r\n\r\nreaction   of   their   representatives   in   the\r\n\r\nInternational   Chamber  of   Commerce   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Employers'    Federation    to    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's, proposal to set up a national  wage\r\n\r\ncouncil  as reported in the Straits Times on  14th\r\n\r\nJuly,  1971.  One  of  them  re-marked  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had its, own idea of the  council.  By\r\n\r\nthat  remark,.  I take it to mean that  he  had  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  idea  of  what the council  should  be.\r\n\r\nAnother employers' representative piously remarked\r\n\r\nthat  \"If  the wage increases were kept  in  hand,\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  no inflationary effect.\"  Before\r\n\r\neven   considering  what  constitute   fair   wage\r\n\r\nincreases, they are already sounding a warning  on\r\n\r\nthe  inflationary  effects of wage  increases.  In\r\n\r\nyesterday's  Straits Times,  a  spokesman  of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Chamber of Commerce was reported  to\r\n\r\nhave  said  that  the  proposed  telephone  rental\r\n\r\nincrease  would only tend to \"narrow the  area  of\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre   for   wage   increases\".   Both    the\r\n\r\nInternational   Chamber  of   Commerce   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Employers' Federation represent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  most  successful employers  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic,   many   of  whom  are  not   Singapore-incorporated  firms. Their reactions  and  remarks\r\n\r\nare significant in that they betray the reluctance\r\n\r\nof  some employers to grant a fair share of  their\r\n\r\nsubstantial profits to their employees. The  irony\r\n\r\nof  it all is that even if the trade unions manage\r\n\r\nto squeeze an additional one or two months' salary\r\n\r\nfrom  such  employers, the latter  would  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in passing the bill to the  consumers,\r\n\r\nwho include the workers. As a matter of fact, wage\r\n\r\nincreases can be easily met out of the substantial\r\n\r\nprofits of the employers even without steps  being\r\n\r\ntaken  to  streamline and modernise the prevailing\r\n\r\nset-up  and operations of the various enterprises.\r\n\r\nIt  goes without saying, of course, that a prudent\r\n\r\nemployer  would  be  expected  to  take  all   the\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to reduce production and operation\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is meaningless for workers to regard\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  partners with the  Government  and\r\n\r\nemployers  in Singapore's progress and  prosperity\r\n\r\nwhen  the  employers make it a point  to  preclude\r\n\r\nthem from having a fair share of the fruits of the\r\n\r\nprosperity to which they have greatly contributed.\r\n\r\nThe  problem today is one of educating some of our\r\n\r\ntight-fisted  employers to realise  the  folly  of\r\n\r\ntheir persistent refusal to see beyond their  nose\r\n\r\nthat  their true interest must necessarily lie  in\r\n\r\nthe fair treatment of their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic growth, some degree of\r\n\r\ninflationary   effect  is  inevitable.   What   is\r\n\r\nimportant is that the rate of inflation should  be\r\n\r\nkept  to  the lowest level possible. Inflation  in\r\n\r\nour  Republic  thus far, unlike inflation  in  the\r\n\r\nhighly  developed countries of the world,  is  not\r\n\r\ndue  to  wage increases. Wage levels in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave    remained   remarkably   stable   over    a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  period of time. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  same  comment  cannot be made  of  the  price\r\n\r\nlevels in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, there have been rampant\r\n\r\nincreases  in the prices of consumer goods,  which\r\n\r\nare very often\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunjustified price-hikes and profiteering  by  some\r\n\r\nunscrupulous traders and shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These runaway price increases are bound to upset\r\n\r\nnot  only  wage stability, but also cause  genuine\r\n\r\nhardships,  particularly to families in  the  low-income  group. We must not forget that  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  120,000 workers employed both in the private\r\n\r\nand  public sectors whose take-home pay per  month\r\n\r\nis  between $100 and $200, and many of  them  have\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  support. They are the  persons  most\r\n\r\naffected by any increase in the cost of living, no\r\n\r\nmatter how slight. And these persons form the bulk\r\n\r\nof   our   factory  workers,  without   whom   our\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth would not have  been  possible;\r\n\r\nour  Division  IV civil servants  and  our  public\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  employees, without whom  our  streets\r\n\r\nwould not be clean, and the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\nand  the  Housing and Development Board would  not\r\n\r\nfunction efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, therefore, that one of the\r\n\r\nurgent  tasks before the Government is  to  uplift\r\n\r\nthe  social conditions of the low-income group  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  I hope that after assessing the  effects\r\n\r\nof   the   British  run-down  in  May  1972,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will pay particular attention  to  them\r\n\r\nin  the  general review of the wage policy.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  any general wage increases for them,  active\r\n\r\nsteps must be taken to initiate schemes to improve\r\n\r\nand upgrade their skills in order to enlarge their\r\n\r\nearning capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawkers and taxi drivers also make up the\r\n\r\nlower  strata of our society. Unless they  find  a\r\n\r\nstake  in Singapore's prosperity, they are  likely\r\n\r\nto pose a social problem in the years to come. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  be  congratulated  on  proposing\r\n\r\nsteps recently to improve the lot of such persons.\r\n\r\nI refer to the proposal to allocate $5 million for\r\n\r\nthe acquisition of land in a pilot scheme to build\r\n\r\nclean  and  attractive  footstall  complexes   for\r\n\r\nrenting  out  on  a subsidised basis.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nproviding  cheap and wholesome meals, the  hawkers\r\n\r\ncan  look  forward to better business in  view  of\r\n\r\ntheir cleaner and more attractive stalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support given by the Government to the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C, has  enabled it to run a  transport  co-operative  (COMFORT)  with the  purchase  of  some\r\n\r\n1,000  taxis  and  200 mini-buses  for  our  taxi-drivers  and  mini-bus drivers. The COMFORT  taxis\r\n\r\nand  mini-buses not only help to provide  improved\r\n\r\ntransport services, but also enable the respective\r\n\r\noperators  to  be  owners of the taxis  and  mini-buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of the shortage of\r\n\r\nlabour. The importation of foreign labour to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  labour shortage is fraught with all kinds  of\r\n\r\nimplications and may be inimical to the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests  of  Singapore.  Though  I  accept   the\r\n\r\nrationale  that  the  present shortage  of  labour\r\n\r\nbeing   experienced  by  our  factories,  if   not\r\n\r\ncounteracted   as  speedily  as  possible,   would\r\n\r\nslacken the pace of our industrial expansion, I am\r\n\r\nof  the  view that we should not be contented  now\r\n\r\nthat  the  importation of foreign labour seems  to\r\n\r\nhave  resolved  the labour shortage  problem.  The\r\n\r\npresent  shortage  of labour  should  serve  as  a\r\n\r\ntimely  reminder to us of the urgent need to  make\r\n\r\nconstructive  plans for the future  regarding  the\r\n\r\nmaximum utilisation of our own human resources for\r\n\r\nour  manpower  requirements.  The  importation  of\r\n\r\nforeign labour is at best a short-term solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some scheme may be devised for the\r\n\r\nemployment   of   a  greater  number   of   women,\r\n\r\nespecially housewives, in factories. The  validity\r\n\r\nof  the  old saying, \"A woman's place  is  in  the\r\n\r\nhome\",  has  already been disputed by the  women's\r\n\r\nliberation  movement.  In  industrially   advanced\r\n\r\ncountries,  women  have abandoned  the  chores  of\r\n\r\nhousework  and taken to employment in the  offices\r\n\r\nand  factories. The departure from the traditional\r\n\r\nconcept  of  the role of women is in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  \"fraternity,  liberty,  equality\r\n\r\n(with  man)\", and is also rewarding  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nenhancing the family income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we find many of our married women\r\n\r\nworking in offices, schools, hospitals, and so on,\r\n\r\nbut  they  come largely from the middle-income  or\r\n\r\nupper middle-income groups. They are usually well-educated as their jobs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemand that of them. They get domestic help to  do\r\n\r\nthe  chores of housework and the caring  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the housewives from the lower\r\n\r\nincome  homes, however, is different. They  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to hire domestic help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many clean factories now sited in housing\r\n\r\nestates providing job opportunities, steps  should\r\n\r\nbe taken to encourage the housewives living nearby\r\n\r\nto seek employment in the factories. One such step\r\n\r\nis   the  building  of  more  creches  in  housing\r\n\r\nestates. Perhaps tax incentives could be given  to\r\n\r\nfactories   requiring  large  numbers  of   female\r\n\r\nworkers to encourage them to build creches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our more enterprising Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  be encouraged to establish laundrettes  in\r\n\r\nhousing  estates to provide cheap laundry services\r\n\r\nwith the use of washing machines. With the creches\r\n\r\nto  look after their children and laundry services\r\n\r\nto  look after their laundry, many housewives will\r\n\r\nbe  freed from their household chores and  enabled\r\n\r\nto  find  suitable employment in nearby factories.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, they will help to increase the income\r\n\r\nof  their  families and improve  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of their families. At the same time,  they\r\n\r\nare  making a useful contribution to the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government, as an employer,\r\n\r\nwill not forget the civil service in its review of\r\n\r\nthe  wage policy next year. The role of the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  socio-economic  development   of\r\n\r\nSingapore has been both significant and vital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the problem of brain drain from\r\n\r\nthe civil service to the private sector because of\r\n\r\ngreater  rewards offered, perhaps  the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  take  one  positive measure  to  counter  the\r\n\r\nattraction of the private sector, that is, a home-ownership scheme of Government-built houses.  With\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  considerable   experience   in\r\n\r\nhousing programmes, I am sure that Government  can\r\n\r\nbuild comparatively cheap houses and sell them  to\r\n\r\ndeserving  civil servants at cost as an inducement\r\n\r\nto them to remain in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to comment, from my own personal\r\n\r\nobservation,    that   the   various    Government\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  departments  seem  to  be  poorly\r\n\r\nserved  in the field of public relations. The  sum\r\n\r\ntotal  of  public relations efforts of  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  departments  seems  to   be   the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  a public relations  officer  whose\r\n\r\nsole  function seems to be the drafting of replies\r\n\r\nto letters of complaints in the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely public relations, which constitute an\r\n\r\nimportant   aspect   of   modern   and   efficient\r\n\r\nmanagement  and organisation, should be  conducted\r\n\r\non  a  more constructive and effective basis. This\r\n\r\nis  all the more important from the point of  view\r\n\r\nof the Government in that it is both desirable and\r\n\r\nnecessary to obtain the support of the public  for\r\n\r\nthe  policies of the Government through the better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of such policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that Government should give more\r\n\r\nattention and make efforts to improving its public\r\n\r\nrelations activities, as what is at stake  is  the\r\n\r\npublic  image  of the Ministries,  departments  or\r\n\r\nstatutory boards concerned. It is not my intention\r\n\r\nto  cast  any aspersion or slur on the  fine  work\r\n\r\ndone  by the serving public relations officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  Ministries.

The second group are those who  do\r\n\r\nnot  subscribe to democracy but believe  in  their\r\n\r\nown   concept   of  \"people's  democracy\",   which\r\n\r\nobviously  refers to a one-party state.  The  last\r\n\r\ngroup  applies  to those who, while hesitating  to\r\n\r\nstep  forward to meet the challenges of democracy,\r\n\r\ncontent  themselves by giving frequent  advice  to\r\n\r\nall and sundry on how to conduct themselves, while\r\n\r\ncompletely  ignoring their own  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nsociety  and  the nation. They are the \"escapists\"\r\n\r\nwho  live  in a world of their own creation  while\r\n\r\nnot  hesitating to provide frequent \"intellectual\"\r\n\r\nsolutions  to the political and economic  ills  of\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a few pertinent questions are directed\r\n\r\ntowards  this minority group, it would  thoroughly\r\n\r\nexpose  them  as  men with ambition  but  with  no\r\n\r\nsubstantial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  from any section of the population.

Despite the commendable proposals of the\r\n\r\nMinistry   contained  in  the  addendum   to   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  speech  to  improve  the  quality  of\r\n\r\neducation    through   increased    emphasis    on\r\n\r\nbilingualism,  technical  training  and   a   more\r\n\r\nflexible system to meet individual student  needs,\r\n\r\nI  remain  unconvinced that these noble objectives\r\n\r\ncan  be  achieved without an efficient and  highly\r\n\r\nmotivated teaching force. The bulk of our teachers\r\n\r\ntoday  are  far from motivated, a good  number  of\r\n\r\nthem  far  from efficient, and will remain  so  if\r\n\r\nthey are not adequately rewarded for the important\r\n\r\nand  arduous role which they are expected to  play\r\n\r\nin educating the young of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education seems to have realised\r\n\r\nthis  problem by its recent attempt to revise  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of teachers, although by some mysterious\r\n\r\nact, it has not mentioned this in the addendum  to\r\n\r\nthe  President's speech. Perhaps it fights shy  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that its proposed wage revision scheme is\r\n\r\nineffectual and no more than a mere token.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an analysis of the wage revision for\r\n\r\nteachers  by  the Education Ministry would  reveal\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no immediate incentive  whatsoever\r\n\r\nconducive  to  attracting  and  promoting   higher\r\n\r\nstandards  of  performance in  the  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nteaching profession, especially in respect of  the\r\n\r\nordinary  teachers.

This is  indeed\r\n\r\nironical  when we realise that it is the rank  and\r\n\r\nfile   teachers  who  really  perform  the  actual\r\n\r\nfunction  of teaching, while the senior assistants\r\n\r\nand  principals are mere arm-chair administrators,\r\n\r\nand  that  it  is  the teaching  standard  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary teachers that we seek to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I submit that the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  should  re-study  its  proposed   salary\r\n\r\nrevision  scheme so as to provide a more equitable\r\n\r\nand  effective  salary  structure  to  generate  a\r\n\r\nhigher  standard of performance among the teachers\r\n\r\ndirectly  responsible  for the  education  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish also to touch on other problems\r\n\r\nconfronting  Singapore which, if  not  effectively\r\n\r\nhandled, will seriously threaten the stability and\r\n\r\nprogress of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Government's urban renewal\r\n\r\nprogramme has inflicted considerable economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  hardships on those sections of our  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  been affected by it. A large proportion\r\n\r\nof  these  people are small businessmen,  workers,\r\n\r\npetty   traders   and  farmers  who   find   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and traditional environment threatened\r\n\r\nby the upheaval of urban renewal. However, while I\r\n\r\nbelieve that a certain amount of sacrifice for the\r\n\r\ngood  of  the  country should be forthcoming  from\r\n\r\nthese  people, I feel that the Government is  duty\r\n\r\nbound  to act judicially in the interest of  these\r\n\r\npeople.  I  must  commend the Government  for  its\r\n\r\nintention to increase the rate of compensation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty owners affected by urban renewal schemes.\r\n\r\nI  wish,  however,  to bring to  the  Government's\r\n\r\nattention  the  plight `of the tenant  shopkeepers\r\n\r\nand   the   petty  traders  who  find   themselves\r\n\r\ngradually  pushed out of the streets  where  their\r\n\r\nsource  of livelihood comes from. As these  people\r\n\r\nare considerable in number, especially in the city\r\n\r\nareas, I am in favour of the Government setting up\r\n\r\na  permanent  body to look after the  resettlement\r\n\r\nproblems  of these people. Hitherto, the piecemeal\r\n\r\nefforts  of different Government departments  like\r\n\r\nthe  H.D.B.,  the  Hawkers' Department,  etc.,  to\r\n\r\nresettle   these  people  have   been   far   from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  as complaints of  high  rentals  or\r\n\r\nalternative  Government  accommodation  and  other\r\n\r\nproblems  abound.  Among the  matters  which  this\r\n\r\nproposed  body  can look into are  more  `economic\r\n\r\nrentals for the poorer classes in H.D.B, flats and\r\n\r\na  longer  period  of  rent subsidies  for  tenant\r\n\r\nshopkeepers   provided  with  alternative   H.D.B.\r\n\r\naccommodation for their shops. This body can  also\r\n\r\nseriously  look into the possibility of  providing\r\n\r\nalternative  employment  and  controlled   hawking\r\n\r\nsites  for  those petty hawkers who are  gradually\r\n\r\ntaken  off  the  streets  as  a  result  of  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, I am for the establishment of a\r\n\r\npermanent body to minimise the hardship  of  those\r\n\r\naffected   by  our  urban  renewal  programme   in\r\n\r\nwhatever way the Government can afford to do. Such\r\n\r\na body, I believe, can more effectively handle the\r\n\r\npresent  and future resettlement problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to touch on the very\r\n\r\nimportant issues of defence and foreign policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in agreement with the Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\naddendum  that our foreign policy in the past  has\r\n\r\nbeen relatively inward-looking out of necessity to\r\n\r\nensure  domestic stability and to aid  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  and industrial development. I  do  agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  in the future be  more  outward-looking   by   reacting   more   consciously   and\r\n\r\nrealistically  to  bigger  power  and  super-power\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the Pacific region.

Although the Taiwanese and\r\n\r\nVietnamese today have their own Governments,  they\r\n\r\ndo  not have sovereignty over themselves, as  they\r\n\r\nare  not in a position to decide what their future\r\n\r\nwill  be.  They lack the ultimate weapon of  self-reliance, and their future will be decided between\r\n\r\nWashington  and  Peking  in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nconvenience    of   these   two   super    powers.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must realise that  Singapore  should\r\n\r\nnot be trapped in a similar situation if they wish\r\n\r\nto  continue to live with respect and  dignity  in\r\n\r\nthe  future. They should ensure that we  have  our\r\n\r\nown  defence force capable of ultimately defending\r\n\r\nour  own  sovereignty, and not  allow  some  other\r\n\r\nforeign  powers  to  take charge.  We  should  not\r\n\r\nexpect  any  foreign powers to  intervene  on  our\r\n\r\nbehalf  in  the  case  of any armed  conflict.  No\r\n\r\nforeign  power will be in the least interested  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us unless its own interest is at stake. Some\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this House may have  read  about  the\r\n\r\nPentagon  Papers in the June 28th  issue  of  Time\r\n\r\nmagazine.

During  the   family\r\n\r\nplanning  campaign organised  last  year  by  the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning Board, I had the opportunity  of\r\n\r\nobserving  life  in several of  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates. I noticed that  nearly\r\n\r\nall  the  large families living in  H.D.B, flats\r\n\r\nwere  from the lower income level, in the  H.D.B.\r\n\r\none-room  flats,  for  example,  the  number   of\r\n\r\noccupants averaged, strangely enough, some six to\r\n\r\neight  people. Most of these people  were  either\r\n\r\nresettled families affected by clearance  schemes\r\n\r\nor   those  dependent  for  their  livelihood  on\r\n\r\nhawking  or  other low-paid jobs such  as  manual\r\n\r\nlabour  and lorry driving. If we do not  want  to\r\n\r\nsee  our  H.D.B, estates degenerate  into  slums\r\n\r\nbecause of this kind of overcrowding, our  people\r\n\r\nmust  be  made to understand the vital importance\r\n\r\nof  family  planning, the need to keep  a  family\r\n\r\nsmall  in  order to maintain a high  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore eradicate the old concept\r\n\r\nthat  large  families are a sign  of  prosperity.\r\n\r\nLarge  families, more often than  not,  mean  low\r\n\r\nfamily  income, with the parents having  to  work\r\n\r\nextra  hard  to  supplement their finances.  This\r\n\r\nwill   automatically  mean   that   very   little\r\n\r\nattention is paid to the children, and this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould lead to a drop in the quality of education,\r\n\r\nat  a  time when education is all-important to  a\r\n\r\nyoung  and vigorous Republic determined to  speed\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting to life in high-rise flats -which has\r\n\r\nbecome the order of the day-- is but one aspect\r\n\r\nof adapting to urbanisation and modernisation,\r\n\r\nwhich is inevitable in our society.

Sir, the President\r\n\r\nrightly said in his policy speech on the 21st  of\r\n\r\nJuly  that  most of our people have accepted  the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  life in present-day Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat  their  approach  to problems  is  generally\r\n\r\npractical  and tolerant. Sir, we, the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  are  indeed glad to hear  these  most\r\n\r\nencouraging and rewarding words. Tributes are due\r\n\r\nto  our people for their understanding, tolerance\r\n\r\nand  support without which no government, however\r\n\r\nefficient  it is, can successfully implement  its\r\n\r\npolicies.  The sacrifices of our people  for  the\r\n\r\nsake of the country's progress and well-being are\r\n\r\nenormous.  It is appropriate now that  we  should\r\n\r\nplace on record the tremendous contribution  that\r\n\r\nour   people   have   made  to  our   present-day\r\n\r\nprosperity.  During the last  six  years  of  our\r\n\r\nindependence, we have shown, beyond any doubt  to\r\n\r\nthe  world, that although we are a small  nation,\r\n\r\nwe have the capacity and determination to live as\r\n\r\na people, survive and continue to prosper. We set\r\n\r\ndown  our  aim  to transform our  once  disparate\r\n\r\ncommunity   into   a  modern  and  industrialised\r\n\r\nnation. This is by no means an easy task, and yet\r\n\r\nwe  have achieved in these six years what it took\r\n\r\nsome advanced countries half a century or more to\r\n\r\nattain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, we have to set our aims even\r\n\r\nhigher. To achieve this, it is imperative that we\r\n\r\nshould  be  viable in defence and stable  in  our\r\n\r\ninternal  security. This is critically  necessary\r\n\r\nfor we are only assured of stability and security\r\n\r\nfor a few more years under the Commonwealth Five-Power Defence arrangement. After this, we will be\r\n\r\nby  ourselves.  We  should  always  remain  alert\r\n\r\npolitically, and invulnerable in our defence.  No\r\n\r\nsubversion from within or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naggression from without can ever rend us asunder.\r\n\r\nWe  either survive or disintegrate. Our choice is\r\n\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to our water resources which\r\n\r\naffect  our  very survival. It is  heartening  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  Public Utilities Board  will  be\r\n\r\ntaking  measures to develop our water  resources.\r\n\r\nShort of this effort, we will not be able to cope\r\n\r\nup  with  demand  of  the growing  population.  I\r\n\r\nendorse  the  views  of my  two  colleagues,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Anson and Bukit Panjang, who earlier\r\n\r\nin the House suggested to open up new reservoirs,\r\n\r\nor  to  enlarge  the existing ones.  I  would  go\r\n\r\nfurther to suggest that more catchments should be\r\n\r\ncreated  to collect rainfall that goes  into  our\r\n\r\nnetwork  of drainage in the city area.  The  rain\r\n\r\nwater  so collected can then be pumped and  drawn\r\n\r\nthrough  pipes into reservoirs. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nyou  are  aware  that most of  the  rainfall  has\r\n\r\nfallen underground through bare soil in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.   We  should  therefore  look   into   the\r\n\r\nfeasibility of tapping water resources  that  can\r\n\r\nbe  found in abundant supply underground. We  can\r\n\r\nopen  up wells on a large scale and draw  up  the\r\n\r\nspring water to supplement our shortage of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retrenched civilian employees have\r\n\r\nbecome   a  problem  which  needs  our  immediate\r\n\r\nattention  in  the next few months. I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has taken steps  to  absorb\r\n\r\nthem  into alternative employment in the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. There is the problem  of\r\n\r\nfinding  them jobs of equivalent posts  with  pay\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  what they received during employment\r\n\r\nwith the British military establishments. Most of\r\n\r\nthese  employees  have reached their  mid-forties\r\n\r\nand  have  still to support their minor children.\r\n\r\nLesser   pay  in  their  new  jobs  will   create\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardship. One solution to assist  them\r\n\r\nto  earn more money would be to allow them to  do\r\n\r\npart-time  work  outside  their  jobs.  This   is\r\n\r\nnormally  not  allowed if  they  are  taken  into\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments. Sir, the P.U.B, is  now\r\n\r\nfacing   a   shortage  of  meter   readers,   and\r\n\r\nemployment of more meter readers will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninevitably increase their operational costs.  May\r\n\r\nI  suggest that the P.U.B, consider a proposal of\r\n\r\noffering these retrenched civilian employees part-time  work  in meter reading. 1 am sure  some  of\r\n\r\nthem will he willing to earn extra income to make\r\n\r\nup  the deficit in their earnings. I do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  attempt to work out how the scheme should  be\r\n\r\ncarried out, and I shall leave it to the PUB, to\r\n\r\nconsider  its feasibility. Perhaps such part-time\r\n\r\nwork  can be carried out on weekends and  in  the\r\n\r\narea near the homes of the part-time workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I conclude by expressing my full support\r\n\r\nand  appreciation  of the policy  speech  by  our\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntook  office  in  1959, there were  only  300,000\r\n\r\nchildren   in  schools,  and  the  privilege   of\r\n\r\neducation  was  limited only to a lucky  few.  In\r\n\r\nless  than a decade, this Government has  ensured\r\n\r\nevery  child  a place in school and 10  years  of\r\n\r\neducation.  Today, the question is no longer  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  sufficient places  in  school  for\r\n\r\nchildren,  hut the emphasis is on the improvement\r\n\r\nof  the  quality of education. As stated  in  the\r\n\r\naddendum to the President's speech at the opening\r\n\r\nof   this   Parliament,  this   Government   will\r\n\r\nconcentrate  its  efforts on  developing  a  more\r\n\r\nflexible  education system and  curriculum,  with\r\n\r\nparticular emphasis on language teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Jurong has certain\r\n\r\nreservations about this, and I would like to take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to clarify a few points.  First\r\n\r\nof  all, let me assure him and the House that the\r\n\r\nemphasis   on   language   teaching   does    not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean it will be done at the  expense\r\n\r\nof   other  subjects.  On  the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of other subjects is to supplement  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of language. What we try to achieve  is\r\n\r\nto  have all lessons being considered as language\r\n\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes that have been taking place in\r\n\r\nthe revision of the curriculum have been done  in\r\n\r\nthe closest consultation with the Teachers' Union\r\n\r\nand  those  in  the  teaching profession.  1  can\r\n\r\nassure  the House, especially the Members in  the\r\n\r\nteaching  service, that there will be  continuous\r\n\r\nand close consultations with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah raised the question of\r\n\r\nthe salary structure for the teaching service. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I could hardly disagree with him on\r\n\r\nthe importance of a motivated teaching force. But\r\n\r\n1  wonder  if financial remuneration is the  only\r\n\r\ncriterion   for   motivation  in   the   teaching\r\n\r\nprofession. I would like to refer him to the very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  seminar organised this  year  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Teachers' Union. I  think  it  is  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  consensus that the bargaining  power  of\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  profession is in  the  display  of\r\n\r\ntheir  professional expertise,  and  not  in  the\r\n\r\nconstant  moaning of self-pity. The  negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween  the Ministry and the unions are  on  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the salary scales  to  iron  out\r\n\r\ncertain anomalies. I fail to understand what gave\r\n\r\nhim  the  impression that only a certain selected\r\n\r\ngroup  of  senior assistants and  principals  are\r\n\r\nbeing  promoted. The principle of the new  salary\r\n\r\nscale is to enable teachers to be promoted within\r\n\r\ntheir  own ranks. In fact, I could hardly  answer\r\n\r\nany   more   of   his   questions   because   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations have not yet been finalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Jurong also raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  long  queues  at  schools.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  I  would  like  to   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity to emphasise two facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There are more Primary 1 places than are\r\n\r\nrequired.  For  1972, there will he  over  60,000\r\n\r\nPrimary   I  places  for  the  estimated   51,000\r\n\r\nchildren seeking admission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For last year, 95 per cent of the parents\r\n\r\nobtained places for their children in schools  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  choice. There is therefore no  reason\r\n\r\nfor him to believe that it will be any worse this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These facts have been reported by most of the\r\n\r\nlocal  newspapers recently, and it is most amazing\r\n\r\nhow the Member for Jurong, who is the President of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Chinese  Middle  School  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion and a teacher himself, could be ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthese   facts.   Perhaps   the   temptation    for\r\n\r\nsensationalism and publicity is irresistible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that there are long\r\n\r\nqueues at the schools for registering children  in\r\n\r\nPrimary   I   classes  is  the   most   perplexing\r\n\r\nphenomenon.  Let me quote an example.  Last  year.\r\n\r\nafter  parents  had queued for many  days  to  get\r\n\r\nplaces in Primary 1 classes for their children  at\r\n\r\nthe   Raffles   Girls'  School,   an   established\r\n\r\nGovernment  English  primary  school,  there  were\r\n\r\nstill  12  vacancies remaining at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nregistration  exercise.  Perhaps  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong would like to send his sympathies to  those\r\n\r\nwho  had queued up for the seven days. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  for the other established schools, such  as\r\n\r\nChong  Pun Girls' School, which has an average  of\r\n\r\n96  per cent P.S.L.E, passes for many years,  and,\r\n\r\nfor  that  matter,  Nan Chiau  School,  there  are\r\n\r\nhardly any queues at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the background of the primary\r\n\r\nschools   attended  by  this  year's   President's\r\n\r\nscholars  could be very interesting. Of  the  nine\r\n\r\nscholars,  seven received their primary  education\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  of whom three are from  Government\r\n\r\nschools,  and four from Government-aided  schools.\r\n\r\nOf  these  four,  three are from  Government-aided\r\n\r\nChinese  schools,  and one from a Government-aided\r\n\r\nEnglish  school.  This school and another  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool  are  the only schools in the  list  having\r\n\r\nlong queues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this phenomenon of queuing up\r\n\r\nfor  registration at the schools is not a new one.\r\n\r\nIt   has   occurred  year  after  year.   We   are\r\n\r\nconsidering   various   alternatives,   such    as\r\n\r\nregistration   by   balloting, and   registration\r\n\r\nlimited   only   to   children   living   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood of the schools. But we believe that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatever  measure we take cannot  do  better  than\r\n\r\nsatisfy 95 per cent of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

Members  have  ranged\r\n\r\nexpansively  over the addenda to  the  President's\r\n\r\nspeech  and  dealt  with  refinements  of  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy,    hospitals    and   public    utilities,\r\n\r\nemployment,  hawkers  and  education,  daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers,  cost  of living and our  psychedellistic\r\n\r\nyouth,  quality control, black ops  and  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  industrialisation, profitable recreation\r\n\r\nand  price  hikes, land acquisition,  occupational\r\n\r\ndiseases and family planning, and a host of  other\r\n\r\nmatters including the freedom of the press, all of\r\n\r\nwhich  our responsible Government must necessarily\r\n\r\nand  successfully manage for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that anyone who has followed this\r\n\r\nsession through the five days of debate will agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  that we have quite a job to do. But  the\r\n\r\nleadership of the People's Action Party  will  not\r\n\r\nbe found wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the `60s, there was the task of establishing\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of our economy and security.  We  have\r\n\r\ndone that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the `70s, there is the task of shaping our\r\n\r\ncountry  and  people  into  a  strong,  coherent,\r\n\r\nsovereign nation. We will do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members speaking before me have made thorough\r\n\r\nanalyses  of the political, economic  and  social\r\n\r\nsituations  which confront us. I do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nadd  yet  another.  But I wish to  underline  two\r\n\r\nimperatives  which,  in the last  analysis,  will\r\n\r\ndetermine the outcome of all our efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first imperative is the collective\r\n\r\ncommitment  of the people to nation building.  It\r\n\r\nis  highly imperative that every single  body  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic make a contribution to  the  common\r\n\r\ngood  - from  the business tycoon to  the  busmen;\r\n\r\nfrom  the company director to the charwalla; from\r\n\r\nthe    historiographer   to   the   hawker.   The\r\n\r\ncontribution should be by constructive action, or\r\n\r\neven  by constructive inaction, such as not using\r\n\r\nwater  unnecessarily. The decade before  us  must\r\n\r\nnot   recede   into   history  without   singular\r\n\r\nachievement on our part. To that segment  of  our\r\n\r\ndisinclined youth I say the biggest and  grandest\r\n\r\nhappening in the country is nation building.  Why\r\n\r\nnot be in with it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second imperative is silent but implicit in\r\n\r\nthe voluminous addenda to the President's speech.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  quality of our human resources  upon\r\n\r\nwhich  the achievement of all the plans  that  it\r\n\r\ndescribes is contingent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven score and ten years ago, our forefathers\r\n\r\ncame  to  this  little island, dedicated  to  the\r\n\r\nproposition  that nobody owes anybody  a  living,\r\n\r\nand  the  good life is got out of sheer toil  and\r\n\r\ntenacity  of  purpose. The world  then  was  less\r\n\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are a sovereign nation in a community\r\n\r\nof  sovereign  nations whose interaction  between\r\n\r\nand  among  themselves is determined by multiword\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  the  least  of  which   is   our\r\n\r\nnational  welfare.  We, the  descendants  of  our\r\n\r\nforefathers, stand upon the conviction today that\r\n\r\nno  nation  owes us a living.

But if I\r\n\r\nchoose  to  remain silent, Members will  go  away\r\n\r\nwith  no  replies  to  their  questions  on   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I, as Leader of the House, thank all\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have  taken part  in  this  debate,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  Backbenchers.  Some   of   their\r\n\r\ncriticisms  were constructive, some were  not  so\r\n\r\nconstructive,  but  none  were  destructive.   As\r\n\r\nusual,  as the last speaker has pointed out,  the\r\n\r\ndebate  ranged  over  a  wide  range  of  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  all Ministries. Several  issues  were\r\n\r\nrepeated  by several Members and, as  usual,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National Development attracted  the\r\n\r\nmost  attention. I will now attempt to  reply  to\r\n\r\nsome,  but  not all, of the points raised.  If  I\r\n\r\nchoose  to reply to all of them, Members will  be\r\n\r\nhere the whole night. My replies will not satisfy\r\n\r\nall  Members of Parliament, but if there is  some\r\n\r\nparticular  problem  in  his  constituency  which\r\n\r\nremains unresolved, the M.P, is free to raise the\r\n\r\nmatter  further  directly  with  me  or  with  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may refer to the Member for Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nfirst.  He  suggested  that special  priority  for\r\n\r\npublic  housing  should be given to  occupiers  of\r\n\r\nhomes  who  are  evicted by private developers.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve he went on to say that though these people\r\n\r\nwere  compensated, there were those  amongst  them\r\n\r\nwho  received  only  token  sums  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  be given special consideration or priority\r\n\r\nfor  public  housing similar to those affected  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  urban renewal schemes or  those  whose\r\n\r\nhomes have been burnt down by fire. The Member  is\r\n\r\naware  that there is an Act called the Control  of\r\n\r\nRent  Ordinance in Singapore. This  Act  does  not\r\n\r\napply  to  State  land. Under the Act,  controlled\r\n\r\npremises  are  those built before  7th  September,\r\n\r\n1947.  The result of control means that  not  only\r\n\r\nthe  rents are controlled but also the tenants  of\r\n\r\ncontrolled  premises  cannot  be  evicted  by  the\r\n\r\nlandlord. In the result, the landlord has  to  pay\r\n\r\ncompensation  to the tenant if he desires  him  to\r\n\r\nmove  out. There is no need for the tenant to move\r\n\r\nout unless he considers the compensation adequate.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some tenants have held their landlords to\r\n\r\nransom.  If  the tenant accepts such compensation,\r\n\r\nthen  he has been well paid and he should not  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board for special priority. He is not\r\n\r\ndebarred from applying for accommodation in public\r\n\r\nhousing,  but  he  does not deserve  to  jump  the\r\n\r\nqueue.  In  the  same way, tenants  of  controlled\r\n\r\npremises  living in the Golden Shoe area are  paid\r\n\r\ncompensation  under the Control of  Rent  (Special\r\n\r\nProvisions) Act by those landlords who  desire  to\r\n\r\nevict  these  tenants and rebuild. Some  of  these\r\n\r\naffected  tenants, after being paid  compensation,\r\n\r\nhave  applied to my Ministry to be allowed to jump\r\n\r\nthe  queue for Housing Board accommodation.  Their\r\n\r\nrequests  have  been refused because  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  can  find  no justification  to  give  them\r\n\r\npriority. Their circumstances are certainly not on\r\n\r\nall  fours  with  those of fire victims  or  those\r\n\r\nevicted  under the urban renewal schemes, because,\r\n\r\nas I have said before,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  land  is not bound by the Control  of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance and different rates of compensation  are\r\n\r\npaid for resettlement therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be interested to know the figures in\r\n\r\nrespect of housing applicants as at the 31st  July\r\n\r\nlast month. They are as follows. There are a total\r\n\r\nof  18,912  applications to rent, of  which  about\r\n\r\n8,705   applicants   want  one-room   flats.   For\r\n\r\napplications to purchase, there are in all 29,420.\r\n\r\nAbout  18,000  of them want three-room  flats  and\r\n\r\nanother  517  want three-room point  block  flats.\r\n\r\nAbout  7,900 applicants want four-room  flats  and\r\n\r\nabout  2,800  want five-room flats.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nthere  are  about  1,323 applicants  who  want  to\r\n\r\npurchase  existing  flats. In all,  therefore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  more  than 30,000 applicants who  desire  to\r\n\r\nbuy,  and nearly 19,000 who want to rent. In these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, if the Board were to grant priority\r\n\r\nto tenants of private property who are required to\r\n\r\nmove out by private developers, the list would  be\r\n\r\neven  longer and those already in the queue  would\r\n\r\nhowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to the question of resettlement,\r\n\r\nSir.  The  Member  for Jurong has complained,  and\r\n\r\nrightly so, that the Resettlement Department  team\r\n\r\nin  Jurong  is  under strength. We have  recruited\r\n\r\nyoung  people  to serve as resettlement  officers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, they in turn have been  \"recruited\"\r\n\r\nor  conscripted  into national  service.  When  we\r\n\r\ntrain  more, more have been conscripted!  But  the\r\n\r\ndelay  in the payment of resettlement compensation\r\n\r\nis  not  mainly  due  to the  shortage  of  staff.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  are vacancies in the  department,\r\n\r\nthe  situation there is not any worse off than  in\r\n\r\nany  other Government department. The delay in the\r\n\r\npayment of resettlement compensation is mainly due\r\n\r\nto  the  delay  in  resettlement  cases  accepting\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation or disputing the quantum\r\n\r\nof  compensation. I think the Member is aware that\r\n\r\npayment  of compensation to the settlers can  only\r\n\r\ntake  place  when  they have accepted  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation or are about to vacate the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked why the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board does not sell its shops  to  the\r\n\r\noccupiers. The Board has not sold shops and is not\r\n\r\nat  the  moment in favour of selling them for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the policy of the Government is to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the rental and even selling  prices  of\r\n\r\nflats to enable the lower income group to live  in\r\n\r\ndecent     housing.    However,    non-residential\r\n\r\naccommodation,  such  as  shops,   factories   and\r\n\r\ngodowns,  is  not entitled to public subsidy  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, such shops are normally rented  out  at\r\n\r\nmarket rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the shops are to be offered for\r\n\r\nsale,  they will have to be sold at market prices.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Board did conduct a small survey last\r\n\r\nyear and the result has revealed that the majority\r\n\r\nof  shopkeepers  are not in favour  of  purchasing\r\n\r\nshops at market prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the sale of shops will lead to the loss\r\n\r\nof  control over their use. Members are aware that\r\n\r\nin  all  shopping centres in our housing  estates,\r\n\r\nthe  Board  has always maintained a  diversity  of\r\n\r\ntrade  so as to provide a complete service to  the\r\n\r\nresidents.  If shops are to be sold, they  can  be\r\n\r\nsold  again, and those trades which can afford  to\r\n\r\npay  higher  rentals, such as  banks  and  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies, may squeeze out the smaller trades like\r\n\r\nstationery  and  barber shops  from  the  shopping\r\n\r\ncentre.  If  this happens, then  in  the  end  our\r\n\r\nresidents will not be provided with full  services\r\n\r\nin the shopping centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy of the Board in renting out\r\n\r\nshop premises has worked out quite satisfactorily,\r\n\r\nand  it  appears that there is no valid reason  to\r\n\r\nrevise  it. For resettlement cases, the Government\r\n\r\nis now granting rental concessions for five years,\r\n\r\nstarting  with a 50 per cent rental for the  first\r\n\r\nyear, and it is only in the sixth year  that  the\r\n\r\nresettlement cases pay the normal rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Tiong Bahru raised two\r\n\r\nparticular points amongst others - namely, that in\r\n\r\nresettlement cases, people have been offered shops\r\n\r\neven  if they do not want them, and when they find\r\n\r\nalternative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremises  of  their  own, the Planning  Department\r\n\r\ntakes enforcement action on unauthorised change of\r\n\r\nuse.   Sir,  when  a  census  is  taken   by   the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department on the clearance of shops,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers are requested to indicate the locality\r\n\r\nthey  would  prefer. However, it is not physically\r\n\r\npossible  to  offer  alternative  shops   in   the\r\n\r\nselected localities, in order to facilitate  early\r\n\r\nresettlement, the shopkeepers are in fact  offered\r\n\r\nalternative shops in various localities.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthem accept the offer while others decline it. But\r\n\r\nthe  Housing arid Development Board has not at any\r\n\r\ntime  forced  any shopkeeper to accept  any  offer\r\n\r\nwhich he does not like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who find alternative accommodation\r\n\r\nof  their  own,  they  would be  well  advised  to\r\n\r\nconsult    the    Planning    Department    before\r\n\r\nestablishing   their  businesses   elsewhere.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  know,  there is zoning under  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  in  Singapore, and where the use is contrary\r\n\r\nto  the zoning under the Master Plan, the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment   has  no  alternative  but   to   take\r\n\r\nenforcement  action. Otherwise we  would  have  to\r\n\r\nscrap the Master Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also complained of\r\n\r\nresidents in one-room flats who have requested for\r\n\r\ntransfer  to  2-room or 3-room flats but  have  to\r\n\r\nwait  for  a  long time. From the figures  I  have\r\n\r\nquoted, I think the Member has got his answer. But\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Member could encourage some  of  his\r\n\r\nconstituents  to  purchase  Housing  Board   flats\r\n\r\ninstead  of  renting them. The rent for  a  2-room\r\n\r\nflat  is $40 per month, and that for a 3-room flat\r\n\r\nis  $60 per month. The instalment for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  a  3-room improved flat for a duration  of  20\r\n\r\nyears  is only $47 per month. Therefore, it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  too  difficult for those  who  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to rent either a 2-room or a 3-room  flat\r\n\r\nto purchase a flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee asked why we do not\r\n\r\nbuild more flats. The target is 100,000 units  for\r\n\r\nthe  next  five years. He asked, \"Why do  you  not\r\n\r\nincrease  this  number to, say 125,000  units?\"  I\r\n\r\nwish  we  could. At present, the building industry\r\n\r\nis already overloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShortages  in  both skilled and unskilled  workers\r\n\r\nand building materials, including cement, on which\r\n\r\nMembers  touched, have occurred from time to  time\r\n\r\nand  are  becoming a more common  occurrence.  Any\r\n\r\nfurther increase in the building programme of  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board will only worsen the\r\n\r\nsituation and accelerate the pace of inflation  of\r\n\r\nconstruction costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. Members perhaps can take a little\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  when I say that after 1973,  when  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial number of office buildings and  hotels\r\n\r\nwill have been completed and if there is a decline\r\n\r\nin   the   building  activity  in  the   Republic,\r\n\r\nconsideration   will   certainly   be   given   to\r\n\r\nincreasing or accelerating the building  programme\r\n\r\nof the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from the 1st of July, the Government allowed\r\n\r\nthe  income group of $1,200 to go up to $1,500 per\r\n\r\nmonth in order to enable a wage-earner to purchase\r\n\r\nhis own flat. I am asked why we do not extend this\r\n\r\nlimit  further. I think the answer is obvious.  It\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\napplicants already on the waiting list.  The  fact\r\n\r\nis   that  the  demand  for  Housing  Board  flats\r\n\r\nconsiderably exceeds the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may go on to Tanjong Rhu, Sir. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong  complained that  the  Board  has  not\r\n\r\nprovided  parks or recreational facilities  within\r\n\r\nthe  area.  This is true. But the Member  will  be\r\n\r\npleased  to  know that the Housing Board  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning   Department   are   looking   into   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of providing recreational facilities,\r\n\r\nincluding  a swim-riling pool, on the vacant  land\r\n\r\nopposite  the  Tanjong Rhu Housing  Estate  across\r\n\r\nMountbatten Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Member for Jurong who complained of\r\n\r\nthe location of schools in respect of resettlement\r\n\r\nareas.  This  is  really  not  a  matter  for   my\r\n\r\nMinistry, bat one for the Ministry of Education. I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  the  location  of  schools   is\r\n\r\ndetermined,   amongst  other   factors,   by   the\r\n\r\navailability  of suitable sites  and,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,   proximity  to  pockets  of  population\r\n\r\ncentres. Resettlement in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nselected areas has resulted in changes and  shifts\r\n\r\nin  pockets  of  population, and it  will  not  be\r\n\r\npossible   to   build  a  new  school   in   every\r\n\r\nresettlement  area, especially if schools  already\r\n\r\nexist   nearby.  But  in  the  planning  of  large\r\n\r\nresettlement  estates,  school  sites  have   been\r\n\r\nprovided,  for instance, the Tai Chong  School  at\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang Road, the Loke Yang Public  School\r\n\r\nand Kay Hwa School, First Branch, at Lim Chu Kang.\r\n\r\nA   committee  has  been  established,  comprising\r\n\r\nofficials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education and officers from the  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  Department  and Planning  Department,  to\r\n\r\nlook into this question more comprehensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang hoped that\r\n\r\nWoodlands  would be a better place than Queenstown\r\n\r\nor Toa Payoh. I think his sentiments are shared by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Telok Blangah. The Housing  Board\r\n\r\nhas  had more than 10 years of experience and  has\r\n\r\ncontinually  striven  by trial  and  sometimes  by\r\n\r\nerror  to  improve the standard of public housing.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the Queenstown flats are better than\r\n\r\nthose  in Bukit Ho Swee. But the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nHo  Swee is not to blame. And perhaps Toa Payoh is\r\n\r\nbetter  than Queenstown. The Bukit Ho Swee housing\r\n\r\nestate  was built in a hurry after the  big  fire.\r\n\r\nHence  the  poor conditions in some parts  of  the\r\n\r\nestate.  But the Member for Telok Blangah and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Panjang can rest assured that the\r\n\r\nflats  in  Telok Blangah, which incidentally  will\r\n\r\nlook  over the sea, and Woodlands, which will look\r\n\r\nover  the  causeway, will be even better than  the\r\n\r\nexisting ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He  can  rest  assured  that  the\r\n\r\nproblem  is  being  tackled  on  all  fronts.  Two\r\n\r\nschemes,   the   Kranji/Pandan  and   the   Pierce\r\n\r\nextension,  are at present being implemented  and,\r\n\r\nwhen  completed,  should add Considerably  to  our\r\n\r\nwater  stocks. In addition, a reservoir  at  Bedok\r\n\r\nwill  be built by the Housing Board in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith the Public Utilities Board in connection with\r\n\r\nthe  land  reclamation scheme from Bedok to  Tanah\r\n\r\nMerah.   In   order  to  obtain   fill   for   the\r\n\r\nreclamation, we have to dig a hole. Why  not  turn\r\n\r\nthat hole into a reservoir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of water resources in the off-shore\r\n\r\nislands   is   also   being  carefully   examined,\r\n\r\nincluding  the possibility of connecting  the  two\r\n\r\nends  of  Pulau Ubin to the mainland  and  tapping\r\n\r\nrivers  to fill the reservoir after the sea  water\r\n\r\nhas been pumped out. But there may he difficulties\r\n\r\n-  difficulties  of  sea water seeping  in  again,\r\n\r\ndifficulties in respect of the shipping  lanes  as\r\n\r\nthey  may  hive  to be diverted unless  locks  are\r\n\r\nconstructed,  and the diversion of shipping  lanes\r\n\r\nwill  require  the  co-operation  of  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May `I now turn to the question of conservation\r\n\r\nof  water?  Government has taken action to  remove\r\n\r\ngradually   all  standpipes  and  is   encouraging\r\n\r\nindividual service connections so that in time  of\r\n\r\nwater  rationing, it will be easier  not  only  to\r\n\r\ndevise  a fair system of rationing but also  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  considerable inconvenience  and  hardship  to\r\n\r\npoorer persons who have to queue up at standpipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for desalinisation, the costs are at the\r\n\r\nmoment  prohibitive. As for using  sea  water  for\r\n\r\nflushing  toilets,  there are  also  difficulties.\r\n\r\nFirstly,   corrosion   of  pipes   and   fittings;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the cost of construction  of  a  second\r\n\r\nsystem  of  pipes for distribution; and,  thirdly,\r\n\r\nthe  question of disposal of the waste  after  the\r\n\r\nsea  water has been used. A separate sewage  plant\r\n\r\nwill  have to be built unless the waste is  to  be\r\n\r\ndumped  into the sea to pollute our sea shore  and\r\n\r\nthe waters surrounding us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial water is already being used at Jurong\r\n\r\nwhere  the  plant has a treatment capacity  of  10\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day. It is a pity that not all\r\n\r\nthe  10  million gallons are being used every  day\r\n\r\nand  most  of it goes down the Jurong River.  This\r\n\r\ncapacity  can  be stepped up and the surplus  used\r\n\r\nfor  flushing  of toilets. But here again  a  dual\r\n\r\nsystem  of distribution would be required. Perhaps\r\n\r\na  pilot scheme can be introduced either at Jurong\r\n\r\nor the new towns in Woodlands and Telok Blangah to\r\n\r\nuse  industrial water for flushing of toilets. The\r\n\r\ndifficulties  are  not  insurmountable   and   the\r\n\r\npossibilities  are being examined by  my  Ministry\r\n\r\ntogether with the Public Utilities Board  and  the\r\n\r\nJurong Town Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa, I believe, suggested\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be desirable to introduce a  step-tariff  system. If I may explain, this is a system\r\n\r\nwhere  the P.U.B, charges for the first  block  of\r\n\r\nunits  at a lower rate followed by the second  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  blocks at a higher  rate.  This  would\r\n\r\nprovide  an  incentive  to  consumers  to   reduce\r\n\r\nconsumption. The Member for Whampoa is  looking  a\r\n\r\nlittle  puzzled. I hope I have not misquoted  him.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think it is a good proposal but requires\r\n\r\nexamination, as any tariff must be framed in  such\r\n\r\na  manner as to avoid any possible lowering of the\r\n\r\nstandard of cleanliness and hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst on the question of water, may I join\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Panjang in thanking  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public for their co-operation  in  saving\r\n\r\nwater.  Daily  consumption  has  dropped  from   a\r\n\r\nmaximum of 130 million gallons to about 95 million\r\n\r\ngallons   and  today  hovers  around  100  million\r\n\r\ngallons. The efforts of members of the public  are\r\n\r\ncommendable  and  show  a healthy  and  favourable\r\n\r\nresponse to the exhortations of the P.U.B. If  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  does  not  increase  considerably,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  can hold off water rationing until  the\r\n\r\nrains come in early October or November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah suggested that we form\r\n\r\na  permanent committee to look after the  question\r\n\r\nof resettlement. We will consider this suggestion.\r\n\r\nBut  before  I pass it to my experts, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMember  will  let me know whether  this  permanent\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  look  into  resettlement   problems\r\n\r\nshould  confine its efforts to cases of Government\r\n\r\nresettlement  only,  or is it  to  include  people\r\n\r\nresettled by the private sector'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein complained about Public\r\n\r\nRelations Officers. I think it is the practice  of\r\n\r\nsome  Ministers to hide under the nom de plume  of\r\n\r\ntheir P.R.O. The Member's suggestion is a good one\r\n\r\nbut there are P.R.O.s who do much more than merely\r\n\r\nwrite letters to the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for houses for civil servants, this is a good\r\n\r\nidea.  I  think our civil servants should be  paid\r\n\r\nmore or given more perks, but the question is: how\r\n\r\ndo  we  start and how do we allocate these  flats?\r\n\r\n`There  are  a few thousand civil servants.  Those\r\n\r\nwith incomes under $1,500 per month can apply  for\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board accommodation  now.\r\n\r\nThe  Housing and Development Board can build flats\r\n\r\nfor  civil  servants, but unless we are to  supply\r\n\r\nhouses  to  all  civil servants within  a  certain\r\n\r\ncategory,  how do we allocate these flats?  Do  we\r\n\r\nsay  first come first served? Do we say  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient get priority? How do we decide  who  are\r\n\r\nthe  most  efficient? Or do we merely  ballot  and\r\n\r\nthey take their flats by chance?
