There is no  doubt\r\n\r\nabout  the  many advantages of the metric system which is  based  on\r\n\r\nscientific  conception  and  has  a  direct  parallelism  with   the\r\n\r\nuniversally-used decimal system of numbering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875 in Paris by 18\r\n\r\npioneering  countries, more than 85 nations have adopted the  metric\r\n\r\nsystem  officially. They represent roughly more than 60 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  world's aggregate gross national product. More than 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof  the world's trade is based on the metric system. The percentages\r\n\r\nwill be greater when the United States adopts the metric system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While both the United Kingdom and the United States of America are\r\n\r\nsignatories  to the Metre Convention, it was only in May  1965  that\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  declared its intention  of  using  the  metric\r\n\r\nsystem, and it was only until this year, i.e. 1968, that the  U.S.A.\r\n\r\ndecided to initiate a three-year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudy  on the transformation to the metric system. Australia, Canada\r\n\r\nand  South  Africa  are  believed to be  seriously  considering  its\r\n\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the change-over to the metric system involves not only a\r\n\r\nbasic change in the system of measurement of the country, e.g.,  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  of old measuring devices and machines by new  equipment\r\n\r\nand  the  resultant  costs, it would also  require  a  national  re-\r\n\r\norientation  towards the use and conception of  the  new  system  of\r\n\r\nmeasurement. This indeed was the reason why the United  Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nthe  United States, though among the first signatories of the  Metre\r\n\r\nConvention, are only now considering its adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally true to say that the earlier the change-over is\r\n\r\nbrought about, the less expensive the operation will be and the less\r\n\r\ndifficult  will  be  the problems associated  with  the  conversion.\r\n\r\nTransformation to the metric system, however, is a long process. The\r\n\r\ntraditional  habits  of thinking and conceiving  of  quantities  and\r\n\r\ncomparing  them with each other grow up with one from childhood.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  just  a  simple matter of changing the  physical  equipment\r\n\r\nrequired  for  weights and measures, but a change  in  thinking  and\r\n\r\nconception in the new units of quantity is also required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful change-over could only be brought about with the\r\n\r\nagreement and co-operation of every sector of the economy  industry,\r\n\r\ntrade, education and so on, and not by Government enforcement alone,\r\n\r\nalthough  Government initiative is required. This is  a  problem  of\r\n\r\ngreat complexity affecting the whole society. School text-books, for\r\n\r\nexample,  would  need  to be re-written when  we  adopt  the  metric\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many problems associated with the change-over as well\r\n\r\nas  the  large financial costs that would be involved, it  would  be\r\n\r\ndesirable  to adopt the metric system in the end. In fact,  a  study\r\n\r\nhas  already been initiated at our Industrial Research Unit to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  many  problems connected with the change-over.

The reasons for this large number of acting posts\r\n\r\nhave been the expansion of the service and the establishment of  new\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  Departments (for example, the Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs,  the Ministry of the Interior and Defence, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nScience  and Technology and the Technical Department in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education)  and  the difficulty in recruitment.

The number\r\n\r\nof officers \"officiating\" in unfilled posts in the service as on 1st\r\n\r\nOctober, 1968, was 47.
