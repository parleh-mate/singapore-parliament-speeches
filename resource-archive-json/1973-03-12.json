However,  my\r\n\r\noriginal  expectation, and perhaps those of  others\r\n\r\ntoo,  had  been  that this would  mean  giving  the\r\n\r\nCommercial Crimes Department of the Police  a  real\r\n\r\nskilled  and  qualified fraud squad,  and  that  it\r\n\r\nwould also mean raising that unfortunate department\r\n\r\nfrom  the  status  it has acquired  in  the  Police\r\n\r\nitself,   i.e, of  being  a  sort  of   elephants'\r\n\r\ngraveyard,  to  a more respectable  condition.  But\r\n\r\nnow,  for  better  or  for  worse,  the  Commercial\r\n\r\nOffences  Investigation Department has been  wedded\r\n\r\nto the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we know what advantages there are in this\r\n\r\nmeasure?

The facilities  of  the  Commercial\r\n\r\nCrimes   Branch   of   the  Police   as   presently\r\n\r\nconstituted  were  inadequate  to  cope  with   the\r\n\r\nproblem. It was therefore decided to create  a  new\r\n\r\ndepartment    called   the   Commercial    Offences\r\n\r\nInvestigation Department, which will have  a  staff\r\n\r\nconsisting not only of Police officers but also  of\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  accountants. The  functions  of  this\r\n\r\ndepartment  will be to investigate  offences  under\r\n\r\nthe  Companies Act and the Securities Industry Act,\r\n\r\nas  well  as  to investigate offences of  cheating,\r\n\r\ncriminal   breach   of  trust,   falsification   of\r\n\r\naccounts,   forgery  and  other   offences   of   a\r\n\r\ncommercial nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Estimates have provided for a new\r\n\r\ndepartment  under the Attorney-General's  Chambers,\r\n\r\nthe  objectives can equally be met by an  expansion\r\n\r\nand restructuring of the existing Commercial Crimes\r\n\r\nBranch under the Commissioner of Police.

It  advised people  not  to  be  unduly\r\n\r\nconcerned about the haze which spread over  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge area in this region. It also pointed out that\r\n\r\nit  was  not  of local origin and that it  was  not\r\n\r\nphoto-chemical smog.

However,  I\r\n\r\nwonder why many of our students still go abroad for\r\n\r\ntheir  basic  studies,  facilities  for  which  are\r\n\r\navailable in Singapore.

Govindaswamy  and  Tuan Haji  Mohd.  Ariff  Bin Suradi.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Defence, in a very short\r\n\r\nspace  of  time,  has  done a great  deal  for  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of  our country. Our young people  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  service understand the  problems  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  and they have actively taken part  in  the\r\n\r\nnational service to shoulder the responsibility  of\r\n\r\ndefending our country. Since this task has now been\r\n\r\nestablished on a firm basis, we should now  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  lesser  speed.  On  this  point  of  view,  I\r\n\r\nremember  that  at the opening of this  Parliament,\r\n\r\nwhen   the  President  delivered  his  speech,   he\r\n\r\nmentioned that we can now proceed with the task  of\r\n\r\nnation  building and defence at our own  pace.  The\r\n\r\nsum   to  be  allocated  now  is  $65  million  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  It is only half that  of  last  year.\r\n\r\nThis is a good trend. For this reason, I would like\r\n\r\nto   make  two  suggestions  for  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, relax the applications for part-time national service. There are some people who\r\n\r\nhave  to  provide for their families. Some of  them\r\n\r\nmay  be  graduates and they are very much  required\r\n\r\nboth by the Government and, the private sector. May\r\n\r\nI  quote  an  example? There is a hawker  for  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks.  Because  of ill-health (he  was  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  high blood pressure) his business was carried\r\n\r\non  by his children. However, his son was called up\r\n\r\nfor  national  service last year.  This  particular\r\n\r\nhawker,  that  is  the father, applied  to  Central\r\n\r\nManpower  Base for his son to do part-time national\r\n\r\nservice. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason he gave was that his health was failing  and\r\n\r\nthat   he   could  not  look  after  his  business.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  his application was rejected.  When\r\n\r\nwe deal with applications like this, I suggest that\r\n\r\nthe   Department   concerned  should   give   their\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for those who are studying abroad, we\r\n\r\nshould  either  relax the conditions  for  national\r\n\r\nservice or we grant them deferment. The parents  of\r\n\r\nthese  students  have  paid  a  deposit  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  guarantee that their children  will\r\n\r\nreturn  to  serve national service  when  they  are\r\n\r\nrequired to do so. This is, of course, a reasonable\r\n\r\narrangement.   Some   of  these   students,   after\r\n\r\ngraduation, may be granted scholarships  and  would\r\n\r\ntherefore like to proceed for another year  or  two\r\n\r\nto  do post-graduate research. The parents of these\r\n\r\nstudents  therefore apply for deferment of national\r\n\r\nservice for their children, and I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill   also   give   such  cases  his   sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration.  These graduates  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  more  for the country  when  they  have\r\n\r\nfurther  equipped  themselves with  qualifications,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope the Minister will help them to  fulfil\r\n\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case where two brothers have\r\n\r\nreceived  call-up  notices. As  both  brothers  are\r\n\r\ncalled  up, the family will be affected to a  great\r\n\r\nextent. Their parents have applied for deferment or\r\n\r\nexemption  for one of the boys until the other  boy\r\n\r\nhas  at  least completed his national  service,  so\r\n\r\nthat  this  arrangement will  not  affect  whatever\r\n\r\nbusiness  the  parents have.  This  will  help  the\r\n\r\nfamily to carry on. I think requests of this nature\r\n\r\nare  reasonable, and the Minister should  therefore\r\n\r\nconsider them sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In fact, more than\r\n\r\n300  young  men  have  had their  national  service\r\n\r\ndeferred,  and  in cases where they have  not  been\r\n\r\ncalled up for full-time national service; they have\r\n\r\nbeen asked to do part-time national service. So  it\r\n\r\nis not true that we are being very harsh and pay no\r\n\r\nheed to the economic circumstances of applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding people who study abroad. The\r\n\r\nMember  wants us to be more generous.  Actually,  I\r\n\r\nthink we have been over-generous to the extent that\r\n\r\nwe  are  now  in  some trouble. May I  explain  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances?  I  think  I  made  a  statement  in\r\n\r\nParliament some months ago about requiring  parents\r\n\r\nof  children who are studying abroad to furnish the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with a bond. And we then  decided  that\r\n\r\nthis  bond will be forfeited if the young man  does\r\n\r\nnot  come  back  when he is asked  to  do  national\r\n\r\nservice.  As a safeguard, we appointed a  committee\r\n\r\nto  hear appeals in the event that people say  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot furnish this bond. This bond does  not\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  an awful lot of money  -  $30,000  or\r\n\r\n$50,000.  For  some strange reason which  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand,   the  Appeals  Committee   allow   all\r\n\r\nappeals. As a result, most of the children studying\r\n\r\nabroad,  even  in secondary schools,  are  now  not\r\n\r\nunder bond. The Minister for Home Affairs and I are\r\n\r\nre-examining the whole subject, and we may want  to\r\n\r\nre-establish  the amount of bond and  override  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Appeals Committee. The trouble  is\r\n\r\nthis:  the Member says that those who have  done  a\r\n\r\nUniversity first degree should be allowed deferment\r\n\r\nto do their Ph.D. It starts actually from secondary\r\n\r\nschool,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  at  the  university. We allow them  to  finish\r\n\r\ntheir  secondary schooling abroad. When they finish\r\n\r\nthe Cambridge School Certificate or its equivalent,\r\n\r\nthey   say  they  want  to  do  the  Higher  School\r\n\r\nCertificate. So we allow that. And when we do that,\r\n\r\nthey  say,  \"Look,  I  have  got  a  place  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity.\" If we still allow that, they say, \"You\r\n\r\nknow,  I am doing the Master's Degree.\" After that,\r\n\r\nthen they will say, \"Now I am going to do my Ph.D.\"\r\n\r\nWhen  we have done all that, then the parents  come\r\n\r\nround and say, \"Look, my son is very brilliant.  He\r\n\r\nnow  wants to do a doctorate of Science.\" This goes\r\n\r\non,  and by the time we get him, he probably  is  a\r\n\r\ngrandfather.  This has got to stop,  and  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave no more nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not in sympathy with what the Member has\r\n\r\nsaid.  If  you  can  maintain your  son  abroad  in\r\n\r\nEngland,  Australia, or America, or whatever  place\r\n\r\nit  is, you are not a poor man, and we cannot allow\r\n\r\nsuch  families to form a privileged group to  evade\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards drivers, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nsaid  that  Army  drivers  are  becoming  dangerous\r\n\r\nagain. Actually I can give some details of what has\r\n\r\nhappened  since  I  last  reported  to  Parliament.\r\n\r\nSometime  in  1970, Army trucks  were  involved  in\r\n\r\naccidents  at  the rate of about one  accident  per\r\n\r\n10,000  miles of travel. This is a rather  shocking\r\n\r\nrate  because in the British Army in Singapore  the\r\n\r\naccident  rate  was  one  in  every  40,000   miles\r\n\r\ntravelled. So I enquired very closely into why  our\r\n\r\naccident  rate was so high, and it appeared  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  there were certain faults in the system.  The\r\n\r\nfirst was that when an Army driver got involved  in\r\n\r\nan  accident, he was not dealt with by the Army but\r\n\r\nby  the  Police. So he was charged before a Traffic\r\n\r\nCourt  and  usually he would appear in the  Traffic\r\n\r\ncourt  only  after he had left the Army because  of\r\n\r\ndelays  in  the civil courts. So Army  drivers  who\r\n\r\ncommitted  one offence after another virtually  got\r\n\r\naway scot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfree.  They were not punished. I therefore  decided\r\n\r\nthat  the moment Army drivers are involved  in  any\r\n\r\naccident,  they are to be placed under open  arrest\r\n\r\nimmediately.  The  Commanding  Officer  will   then\r\n\r\ninvestigate the circumstances of the accident,  and\r\n\r\nif it is found that the driver is the guilty party,\r\n\r\nhe will be sentenced to detention. That measure had\r\n\r\nan  immediate  effect in making Army drivers  drive\r\n\r\nmore  carefully.  Hon. Members must  remember  that\r\n\r\nthese  drivers  are,  not  old  people.  They   are\r\n\r\nteenagers, 18 to 19 years old. A 19-year  old  boy,\r\n\r\ndriving  a three-tonner, will generally feel  quite\r\n\r\ngrand  about  it  and  will  try  to  push  smaller\r\n\r\nvehicles  off the road. But when they get  punished\r\n\r\nimmediately for any driving offence, they will say,\r\n\r\n\"Look, we had better be more careful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other defect in the system was that national\r\n\r\nservice drivers also act as driving instructors  to\r\n\r\nthe  new recruits. Hon. Members can imagine  a  19-year  old  boy teaching an 18-year old boy  how  to\r\n\r\ndrive  a  three-ton truck! This is  not  the  ideal\r\n\r\nsystem. So we have to recruit a lot of regulars  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the system of driving instruction is\r\n\r\nmore satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this, we also have to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  trucks  are  better  maintained,  with  proper\r\n\r\nbrakes,  clutches, and so on. This meant  improving\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance of Army trucks, getting more spare\r\n\r\nparts and recruiting experienced mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that has been done, and the result is that\r\n\r\nthe  accident  rate has been reduced substantially.\r\n\r\nFrom  one  accident in every 10,000 miles travelled\r\n\r\nin  1970,  it  has improved to one in every  23,000\r\n\r\nmiles in 1971, then to one in every 27,000 miles in\r\n\r\n1972.  This rate includes accidents where the fault\r\n\r\nlies  not  only with the Army driver but also  with\r\n\r\nthe  other party. So if you say that half the cases\r\n\r\nis  the  fault .of, the Army driver and  the  other\r\n\r\nhalf  the fault of the civilian, you will  get  an,\r\n\r\naccident  rate of one in every 50,000 miles,  which\r\n\r\nmeans that we have at least reached the standard of\r\n\r\ndriving of the British Army in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards speeding, here again the reports of\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police are taken  seriously  and  are\r\n\r\nreported to the Commanding Officer of the  Unit  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  driver is attached, and the  driver  is\r\n\r\ndealt  with by his Commander. I do not quite  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member  for Anson that  there  are  more\r\n\r\nspeeding  cases. In fact, my statistics  show  that\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  speeding  cases  has  gone   down\r\n\r\nslightly.  In 1971, there was a monthly average  of\r\n\r\n34  complaint of speeding. In 1972 it has gone down\r\n\r\nto  26  per month. This is still a lot of cases  of\r\n\r\nspeeding, and I intend to make sure that Commanding\r\n\r\nOfficers punish speeding drivers more severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Polytechnic students at Changi Air\r\n\r\nBase,  we  did not `kidnap' any students  from  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.  These are people who  have  completed\r\n\r\ntheir  studies,  done their national  service,  and\r\n\r\nhave  completed their basic military training. From\r\n\r\nthere,  they  are  sent  to  Changi  Air  Base   as\r\n\r\nmaintenance and repair personnel, where the  skills\r\n\r\nthey  have learned can be put to good use. The  Air\r\n\r\nForce Engineers' tell me that they are doing a good\r\n\r\njob there. So that is a good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan put to me a\r\n\r\nposer  as  to how I can test the loyalty of  people\r\n\r\nwho are outside military age and who are too old to\r\n\r\nbecome soldiers. Well, I really do not know.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it is for me to test their  loyalty.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is something for the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nand Home Affairs to deal with these matters.

This  is  the\r\n\r\nfundamental of our foreign policy. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis   policy,   we  have  established   diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations with many countries in the world and have\r\n\r\nmaintained very close relations with many of  them.\r\n\r\nWe  have  built  up our reputation in international\r\n\r\ncircles. This is the result not only of the  policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, but also  the  result  of  the\r\n\r\nperformance   of  our  knowledgeable  and   learned\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs. The implementation of\r\n\r\nour foreign policy has been very smooth and has met\r\n\r\nwith no obstacles whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we can say we have been very\r\n\r\nbusy  in  our foreign activities. For example,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  went to Europe and  Thailand;  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs went to India and  Sri\r\n\r\nLanka  for  State visits. In all these visits  they\r\n\r\nhave accomplished their mission and our country has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  further strengthen and  consolidate\r\n\r\nrelations with these countries. Now there is  peace\r\n\r\nin   Vietnam   and  international  relations   have\r\n\r\nprogressed further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, in view of this\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  whether our foreign  policy  will  be\r\n\r\nmodified. I would also like to ask: now that  there\r\n\r\nis  peace  in Vietnam, in what direction  will  our\r\n\r\nforeign  policy be taking? Will there be any  basic\r\n\r\nchange? What are the new diplomatic missions to  be\r\n\r\nestablished   in  foreign  countries   to   further\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  relations between these  countries\r\n\r\nand Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  his  estimation of my  performance  is  even\r\n\r\nbetter than my own estimation of myself. However, a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Members have asked a  general  question\r\n\r\nabout Singapore's foreign policy in view of the end\r\n\r\nof the war in Vietnam. Obviously, the settlement of\r\n\r\nthe war in Vietnam creates new conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand new problems for us, because it will definitely\r\n\r\nbring Vietnam into Southeast Asian politics for the\r\n\r\nfirst time since the end of World War II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our objectives, of course, they have\r\n\r\nalways been consistent. First, it is to promote the\r\n\r\nnational  interests  of  Singapore,  whatever   the\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the environment. That is our  constant\r\n\r\ngoal.   Secondly,  it  is  to  promote  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsecurity.  Thirdly, to make friends  with  all  who\r\n\r\nwant  to be friends with us, and fourthly, to  join\r\n\r\nwith  all nations, both in this region and outside,\r\n\r\nwho  would ensure peace, stability and progress  in\r\n\r\nthe  area.  These are constant objectives.  But  we\r\n\r\ncannot be assured of what the concrete situation in\r\n\r\nthe  region  would be, whether there  will  be  one\r\n\r\nVietnam or two Vietnams, and whether the end of the\r\n\r\nAmerican    intervention    in    Vietnam     would\r\n\r\nautomatically end all conflicts in Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nI  do not know. It is obviously clear that we would\r\n\r\nfirst have to wait and see what the outcome of  the\r\n\r\npeace  agreement is. Will there be peace? If  there\r\n\r\nis  peace,  then  things will be  much  easier  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and for this region. But if there are new\r\n\r\nconflicts, then we must study the nature  of  these\r\n\r\nconflicts  to see how they will affect any  of  the\r\n\r\nfour  objectives that I have outlined, and we would\r\n\r\nhave  to make adjustments accordingly. There is  no\r\n\r\nfinality  about foreign policy. Foreign  policy  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which you change according  to  changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances, bearing the four constant objectives\r\n\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the specific questions asked,\r\n\r\nfirst,  by  the Member for Sembawang. He has  asked\r\n\r\nhow  many new missions we intend to set up. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, as Members know, we have about 17 missions.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been the policy of the Government  not  to\r\n\r\nestablish  missions  for the sake  of  prestige  or\r\n\r\nestablishing  a mission just because  everybody  is\r\n\r\ndoing  it.  We only establish a mission when  there\r\n\r\nare   specific  political,  financial  or  security\r\n\r\ninterests  involved. If we feel that any  of  these\r\n\r\ninterests  can best be promoted and safeguarded  by\r\n\r\nhaving  a  mission, then we will have  it.

This is because of the emergence  of  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Economic  Community  not  only  in  world\r\n\r\npolitics   but   possibly  also  in  the   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our region. This is  an  important\r\n\r\nfactor,  and  therefore  we  feel  that  we  should\r\n\r\nestablish  these two missions. It is also  possible\r\n\r\nthat  we may, if not this year then later on,  have\r\n\r\nto  establish some kind of mission in Vietnam. This\r\n\r\nwill  depend on how things work out in Vietnam.  If\r\n\r\nit  works  out according to the terms of the  peace\r\n\r\nagreement,  I think there should be no  problem  at\r\n\r\nall  in  establishing  a mission  either  in  North\r\n\r\nVietnam, South Vietnam or in one Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked what is the latest\r\n\r\nwith   regard  to  our  developing  new  forms   of\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the  People's Republic  of  China.\r\n\r\nBroadly,  what  I  said last year is  still  valid,\r\n\r\nexcept  that  clearly the establishment  of  closer\r\n\r\nrelations between China and the countries of South-east Asia is far more imminent now than it was last\r\n\r\nyear.  But  in view of the particular character  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  society  and  the  particular  image  of\r\n\r\nSingapore among some countries in Southeast Asia, I\r\n\r\nthink it would be convenient and definitely prudent\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to allow other countries  first  to\r\n\r\nestablish  diplomatic missions. We can then  follow\r\n\r\nsuit  soon  after,  without undue difficulties  for\r\n\r\nourselves.  This  is  one of the  reasons,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson has quite rightly pointed out, why\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN countries had an understanding - not  an\r\n\r\nagreement -- that before any such move can be  made\r\n\r\nby  any  one of the ASEAN countries to establish  a\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  mission  in  China,  there  should   be\r\n\r\nconsultation. However, in the case of Indonesia,  I\r\n\r\nmust  point out that they had diplomatic  relations\r\n\r\nwith the People's Republic of China\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore, and they suspended it only because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties they had a few years ago. But in  view\r\n\r\nof   the   fact   that  in  the   present   context\r\n\r\nestablishing diplomatic relations with  China  will\r\n\r\nhave  repercussions of varying degrees on  some  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours, it is only fair and  proper  that,\r\n\r\nbefore  any  member-country makes such a  move,  it\r\n\r\nshould  discuss  the matter with  the  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries with a view to determining whether or not\r\n\r\nsuch  repercussions may affect their own  security,\r\n\r\nnational   interests   or  stability.   Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition at the moment is this: we are prepared  to\r\n\r\nbe at the tail-end of the queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Kra Canal, this matter was\r\n\r\ndiscussed  even when I was a school boy.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nperennial subject which comes up from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut,  as far as we know, only a survey is going  to\r\n\r\nbe carried out. Even if the canal is going to be  a\r\n\r\nfact,  it  will  take  at least  ten  years  before\r\n\r\nanything  can  be done. Therefore, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  be a little bit more relaxed about  the\r\n\r\nproblem. We can give it serious consideration  only\r\n\r\nif it is going to be a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta raised the question of four\r\n\r\nmissions which are without Heads of Missions at the\r\n\r\nmoment.  He  wants to know whether this is  because\r\n\r\nthe   conditions  of  pay  and  service   are   not\r\n\r\nattractive. I can assure him that this is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase.  We  have no difficulty in finding  Heads  of\r\n\r\nMissions  if we want to. But what we are  concerned\r\n\r\nis  to  have a Head of Mission who can perform  his\r\n\r\nfunctions  effectively in the country to  which  he\r\n\r\nwill  be sent. It is more a question of the quality\r\n\r\nof  the  person.  A  Head of Mission  may  be  very\r\n\r\neffective in one country, but he may not be able to\r\n\r\nperform  or  fulfil his functions equally  well  in\r\n\r\nanother   country  because  of  language   or   the\r\n\r\npersonality  of the man in relation to  the  place.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  an  ambassador  in  Washington  must\r\n\r\nbehave  differently from an ambassador  in  Moscow.\r\n\r\nThey have different approaches. That is the problem\r\n\r\nwe are confronted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith.  It  is really a problem of finding  suitable\r\n\r\npersons  for the particular countries, and not  the\r\n\r\nconditions of service. However, I think it is quite\r\n\r\nlikely that some of these missions, in fact all  of\r\n\r\nthem, would have Heads of Missions fairly soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong raised the question of\r\n\r\nencouraging cultural relations and having  treaties\r\n\r\nwith  other countries. As a matter of fact, we have\r\n\r\ncultural treaties with a number of countries.  Some\r\n\r\ncountries  do not sign such treaties but  we  still\r\n\r\nhave  cultural  exchanges,  whether  in  terms   of\r\n\r\nvisiting   troupes   of  musicians,   painters   or\r\n\r\nartistes.  Over  the  years,  this  has  tended  to\r\n\r\nincrease.  What  has  fallen  short  is   that   we\r\n\r\nourselves   have  not  been  in   a   position   to\r\n\r\nreciprocate.  It  is  largely  because  it  is  not\r\n\r\nfeasible  or financially possible for  us  to  send\r\n\r\ncultural  missions  abroad as frequently  as  other\r\n\r\ncountries do. But I hope that in the near future we\r\n\r\nmay  venture  a little bit more than what  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  in  the past and send some cultural missions,\r\n\r\nespecially in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we define \"culture\" a little bit more broadly,\r\n\r\nwe do have cultural exchanges. We have students who\r\n\r\ncome  and  study here. The Institute  of  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsian   Studies  holds  seminars  and  affords   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  intellectuals  and   experts   in\r\n\r\nvarious  fields  to meet together  to  discuss  and\r\n\r\nunderstand one another's problems. In the field  of\r\n\r\ncultural  exchanges, we are not  doing  too  badly,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  is quite true that we can  always  do\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  detailed  reply given by the  Minister  to  my\r\n\r\nsatisfaction, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We   are  relying  mainly  on  the   Vienna\r\n\r\nConvention which governs diplomatic relations under\r\n\r\nwhich the host country or the receiving state  must\r\n\r\nguarantee  the  security of both the  personnel  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the mission in the country to which it  is\r\n\r\naccredited. However, in the normal course of events\r\n\r\nwe  have taken certain elementary precautions,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe  that  we  are  in  a  hostile\r\n\r\nterritory and not because we fear any hostile  acts\r\n\r\nagainst  us,  but  because we want  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nnormal security, like making sure of the bona fides\r\n\r\nof  visitors, fencing of missions where we can, and\r\n\r\ntaking  normal security precautions with regard  to\r\n\r\ndocuments,  confidential reports and so  on.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  that,  there  is no likelihood,  I  hope,  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  embassies in foreign countries suffering\r\n\r\nthe  same fate as that of the Saudi Arabian embassy\r\n\r\nin Sudan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Is this vote provided only\r\n\r\nfor the financial year 1973-74, or will there be  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  provision for the coming years? There  was\r\n\r\nno  such  provision for the financial year 1972-73.\r\n\r\nIf  the photocopying machine is also to be used  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  years,  does the Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  not  think  of saving money  by  buying  a\r\n\r\nmachine rather than renting it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as far as I know, this is a\r\n\r\ncharge for the hire of a photocopying machine.  For\r\n\r\nfinancial  reasons,  it is  cheaper  to  rent  this\r\n\r\nmachine  than  to buy one. Because of  the  various\r\n\r\nsizes  of  documents  to be copied  and  the  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  required for distribution to our missions,\r\n\r\nwe  have found that the small machine which we  now\r\n\r\nhave  is quite unsuitable for this purpose. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, the cost of purchasing a big  machine,\r\n\r\nadvanced enough to handle the material for copying,\r\n\r\nwould   be   unduly  expensive,  in  fact,   almost\r\n\r\nprohibitive if we are to add yearly depreciation to\r\n\r\nthe  cost.  It is felt that for the time being,  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  $5,000 a  year  on  rent  is  more\r\n\r\neconomical than to buy one. But if, at some  future\r\n\r\ntime,  the  volume of material churned  out  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry for distribution justifies this,  then  we\r\n\r\nmay  consider  purchase of  the  machine.  For  the\r\n\r\nmoment, I understand it is not at all economical to\r\n\r\nbuy the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd.

Over the years the call on Singapore  to\r\n\r\ntrain  people  from  ASEAN countries  has  steadily\r\n\r\nincreased. According to statistics that I have, for\r\n\r\nthe  first  year  there were 17 places  in  various\r\n\r\nfields  of  studies, like poultry training,  public\r\n\r\nworks,  road  construction, building  construction,\r\n\r\nsewerage,  and  so  on. For  the  second  year,  it\r\n\r\nincreased to 41 places for some 13 courses such  as\r\n\r\nbotanic   studies,  fire-fighting,   librarianship,\r\n\r\nmarket   gardening,  prison  work,  public  health,\r\n\r\nnursing, social welfare, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the financial year 1973-74, there will be\r\n\r\nsome   47  places  in  16  different  courses  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, this increase is to meet such demands as\r\n\r\nwe  feel would be made on us to train. I think this\r\n\r\nis  a good thing and Singapore is doing far more in\r\n\r\nthis respect. The money is worth the goodwill,  and\r\n\r\nit  also  affords an opportunity for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\npass  on  on  what  skills as it may  have  to  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries in the spirit of  ASEAN  co-operation.  This money is well spent  and  we  hope\r\n\r\nthat if further calls are made to increase the  sum\r\n\r\nnext year, we shall be happy to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3104.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now that two new missions will be set  up  in\r\n\r\nEurope this year, and also \"some kind of mission in\r\n\r\nNorth Vietnam or South Vietnam or one Vietnam\" will\r\n\r\nalso  be  set  up, if necessary.

Workers are either injured, disabled  or\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their lives. The Government  has  taken\r\n\r\nvarious steps to prevent industrial accidents,  but\r\n\r\nthe  situation still remains the same. In fact,  in\r\n\r\nspite of the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures   taken   by  the  Ministry   of   Labour,\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents are still  on  the  increase.\r\n\r\nAccording  to statistics given by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour,   over   the  past  ten  years   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents resulting in death increased by 258,  and\r\n\r\nthe   number   of  workers  involved  in   nonfatal\r\n\r\naccidents increased by 500 per cent. What  are  the\r\n\r\ncauses  for all these increases? We must find  them\r\n\r\nout  and take preventive measures. According to  an\r\n\r\nexplanation  given  by  the Minister,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  these accidents is that  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  is  still  under-staffed,  and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,   inspections   cannot   be   carried   out\r\n\r\nextensively, and that there is really  very  little\r\n\r\nthat can be done to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, during the debate on the Budget\r\n\r\nstatement,  the Minister for Labour  revealed  that\r\n\r\nthe  Factory Inspectorate has a staff  of  only  20\r\n\r\nmembers. This number may have remained the same for\r\n\r\nthe  past  ten years. This is a very unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs. We know that ten years  ago  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  development was still  in  the  initial\r\n\r\nstages.  The  number  of factories  was  then  very\r\n\r\nsmall, around 300 to 400 factories. But now we have\r\n\r\nsome 2,000 factories in Singapore. In spite of this\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of factories, the number  of\r\n\r\nfactory  inspectors still remained at 20.  How  can\r\n\r\nthis number be enough? Because of this gross under-staffing,  a  lot of Labour regulations  cannot  be\r\n\r\nenforced  or  implemented. This shortage  of  staff\r\n\r\nshould  be  overcome. Are we going  to  allow  this\r\n\r\nshortage to carry on and do nothing about  it?  No.\r\n\r\nWe  can  recruit  more  inspectors.  Is  there  any\r\n\r\nproblem  about  the  salary or  the  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions? There should be no problem because  the\r\n\r\nnumber is small, only 20. We have a surplus of some\r\n\r\n$20  million. So, to increase the number of factory\r\n\r\ninspectors will only mean increasing our burden  by\r\n\r\na  very  small  degree. I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nrecruit more factory inspectors to go on rounds  in\r\n\r\nthe factories to enforce the rules and regulations,\r\n\r\nand to ensure that old machines are not allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe used any more. Employers must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheld  responsible for the continued use of old  and\r\n\r\ninefficient   machines.  It  is  only   then   that\r\n\r\nindustrial   safety  measures  can  be  implemented\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of relaxation of\r\n\r\nrequirements for work permits. Although  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen   some  improvement  in  recent  years,   this\r\n\r\nimprovement  is  only in respect  of  the  building\r\n\r\nconstruction industry. So a review has to  be  made\r\n\r\nin  other  respects. For example,  shopkeepers  and\r\n\r\nclerks  are still in short supply because  of  this\r\n\r\nover-restrictive requirement for work permits. As a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this,  some shops for  example,  barber\r\n\r\nshops and coffeeshops are still shorthanded. It  is\r\n\r\nmy  hope  that the Minister will consider a further\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of the requirement for work permits  in\r\n\r\nrespect of clerical staff and shop assistants so as\r\n\r\nto help these shopkeepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, we are experiencing a\r\n\r\nboom of enormous proportions. It is greatly due  to\r\n\r\nour  present economic policy. We have brought about\r\n\r\na sound government. A good and practical government\r\n\r\nhas  brought in investors flocking into this island\r\n\r\nto invest. All this is good for us, considering the\r\n\r\nfact  that many of our neighbours are not so lucky.\r\n\r\nWhereas there is unemployment in many parts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Asia, we are experiencing the reverse. Thus  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  good number of work permit holders  and  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  temporary  work permit  holders.  These\r\n\r\ntemporary  work  permit  holders  have  created   a\r\n\r\nproblem.  Do  you not think, Sir, that  these  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders, who are non-unionised, are  liable\r\n\r\nto  exploitation by unscrupulous employers?  It  is\r\n\r\ntime  we introduced a minimum wage limit for  these\r\n\r\npoor  unfortunate  people  who,  because  of  their\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   have   to   seek   employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding fire-fighting equipment and other\r\n\r\nprofessional appliances to combat fire in firms and\r\n\r\nfactories, could the workers not be taught to  make\r\n\r\nuse of these facilities in case of emergency? Fires\r\n\r\ncan  break  out  at any time during the  course  of\r\n\r\ntheir   duties.  There  are  also  instances  where\r\n\r\napplicants  for work permits have used  decorations\r\n\r\nand  titles to their names to claim certain skills.\r\n\r\nBut  when work permits are issued to them, they are\r\n\r\nfound not able to do any skilled work. This sort of\r\n\r\nirregularity should be corrected. Though the Office\r\n\r\nis  liberal with the issue of work permits to  non-citizens, at this stage I believe there are quite a\r\n\r\nnumber of such \"irregular\" work permit holders.  Is\r\n\r\nthere  any  discrimination in  the  issue  of  work\r\n\r\npermits?  I  have  heard of  a  complaint  of  work\r\n\r\npermits being indiscriminately issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also enlighten the House as to\r\n\r\nthe recent dispute which our seamen encountered  in\r\n\r\nAustralia?  And is there any remedial action  taken\r\n\r\non this subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, according to the Labour Ministry, more\r\n\r\nthan 10,000 accidents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  taken place in work places, of which  over  a\r\n\r\nhundred  cases  are  fatal. In view  of  the  rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   in   Singapore,   we   have   a\r\n\r\nphenomenal  increase  in the number  of  factories.\r\n\r\nHowever, our Factory Inspectorate consists of eight\r\n\r\nInspectors who are expected to carry out spotchecks\r\n\r\non our factories. How can eight Inspectors check on\r\n\r\nfactories  throughout  the  various  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nisland?  No  wonder we have so many  violations  of\r\n\r\nsafety  rules,  and  safety precautions  have  been\r\n\r\nfound to be lax in most factories. If we are really\r\n\r\ninterested  in safety precautions in our factories,\r\n\r\nit  is time the number of Inspectors were increased\r\n\r\nseveral-fold  so that the Factory Inspectorate  can\r\n\r\ndo its work efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  terrible  toll in the number of  accidents  in\r\n\r\nfactories in Singapore is causing great concern  to\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC. I am sure the Minister realises that the\r\n\r\nfour E's towards accident prevention is a necessity\r\n\r\nfor  his Ministry to uphold. The four E's are:  (1)\r\n\r\nEngineering, that is, the safeguarding of machinery\r\n\r\nand  assurance that safety equipment are being used\r\n\r\nby   workers.  (2)  Enthusiasm,  the  creation   of\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  of  the  workers and employers  towards\r\n\r\nindustrial health and safety. (3) Education,  which\r\n\r\nis  a  means to ensure that accidents actually  are\r\n\r\nlimited.

Firstly, appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures   were  taken  to  tighten   up   existing\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  provide for  higher  standards  of\r\n\r\nhealth, safety and welfare in the factories and  at\r\n\r\nconstruction   sites.   Secondly,   the    Building\r\n\r\nOperations  and  Works of Engineering  Construction\r\n\r\nRegulations,  1971, were promulgated to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe problems of high accident rates in the building\r\n\r\nconstruction   trade.  Thirdly,  the   quantum   of\r\n\r\nworkmen's  compensation payable under the Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act was trebled to encourage employers\r\n\r\nto  provide more adequate safety measures for their\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also recall that a two-week long\r\n\r\nnational  campaign on industrial safety and  health\r\n\r\nwas launched in March last year. This was aimed  at\r\n\r\ncreating public awareness to the increasing rate of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents in the Republic  and  driving\r\n\r\nhome  the message that industrial accidents,  quite\r\n\r\napart  from  bringing sorrow  and  anguish  to  the\r\n\r\nvictims  and their families, also result in  social\r\n\r\nand economic losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Factories Bill has gone through its Third\r\n\r\nReading  in  Parliament recently. Upon coming  into\r\n\r\nforce, the provisions relating to the establishment\r\n\r\nof  safety committees and the appointment of safety\r\n\r\nofficers  and industrial nurses would be  enforced.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  quite agree with both the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang and the Member for Anson that the  number\r\n\r\nof  factory inspectors should be increased if it is\r\n\r\nto be more effective - nevertheless, with the force\r\n\r\nthat  is  available at present,  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nstepped   up   its  inspection  of  factories   and\r\n\r\nconstruction worksites with a view to ensuring that\r\n\r\nthe  safety regulations under the law are  strictly\r\n\r\ncomplied with. For the information of hon. Members,\r\n\r\na  total of 11,000 inspections were carried out  in\r\n\r\n1972, doubling that of the previous year, resulting\r\n\r\nin  234 court actions. This result was achieved  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the fact that the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nInspectorate has been rather small, as pointed  out\r\n\r\nby some Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry is also setting up study groups\r\n\r\nto  consider  and make recommendations  on  various\r\n\r\naspects of industrial health and safety in specific\r\n\r\nindustries.  I  think  the shipbuilding  and  ship-repairing  industries will receive prior attention,\r\n\r\nas  the accident rates have been particularly  high\r\n\r\nin  the last year. These study groups will comprise\r\n\r\npersons  who  are conversant and directly  involved\r\n\r\nwith  the  problems in the industries concerned  so\r\n\r\nthat  their  recommendations  can  be  adopted  and\r\n\r\nimplemented. Furthermore, the services  of  an  ILO\r\n\r\nexpert   on  industrial  health  and  safety   have\r\n\r\nrecently been enlisted. Among other things, he will\r\n\r\nhelp   organise  and  conduct  courses  for  safety\r\n\r\nofficers both in the public and private sectors. As\r\n\r\na  further  step,  the Ministry is also  finalising\r\n\r\nplans  for the registration of contractors. Certain\r\n\r\nminimal  safety  standards  will  be  imposed  upon\r\n\r\nregistered   contractors.  It  must,  however,   be\r\n\r\nstressed that prevention of industrial accidents is\r\n\r\na  tripartite responsibility. Without  the  sincere\r\n\r\nand   wholehearted  support  of  the  workers   and\r\n\r\nemployers, stern and punitive measures on the  part\r\n\r\nof  Government alone can at best only  bring  about\r\n\r\npartial  solution.  In this respect,  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nheartening  to  note that the  NTUC  is  taking  an\r\n\r\nactive  interest in educating its  members,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  with the effort of both Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  unions as well as the employers, the  rate  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents may be reduced in the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also made a plea for\r\n\r\nfurther   liberalisation  of  the  issue  of   work\r\n\r\npermits, while the Member for Anson held a contrary\r\n\r\nview.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in so far as the issue  of\r\n\r\nwork  permits is concerned, the Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\ngranting work permits liberally to non-citizens who\r\n\r\npossess   the  skills  Singapore  needs,  who   are\r\n\r\nhardworking  and who, because of their  educational\r\n\r\nor  other  qualifications, can be trained  for  our\r\n\r\nnecessary  skills and disciplines. The request  for\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliberal  issue  of  work  permits  to  white-collar\r\n\r\nworkers, such as clerks and shop assistants, cannot\r\n\r\nbe  granted, because the need for immigrant workers\r\n\r\nis  in  the factories i.e, in the blue-collar jobs,\r\n\r\nnot  the white-collar jobs. The Government  has  no\r\n\r\nintention  to liberalise the issue of work  permits\r\n\r\nfor shop assistants and clerical workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a limit to which the issue of work\r\n\r\npermits can be liberalised. The Government  has  to\r\n\r\nensure  that only those who can contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the economy and the well-being  of  the\r\n\r\nState are admitted, so that the social services for\r\n\r\nour  own  citizens  are  not overstrained  and  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  life is not lowered. So  work  permits\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be liberally given to technicians\r\n\r\nand  skilled workers. If they prove to be an  asset\r\n\r\nto  the  country,  the  Government  will  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  measures to enable them  to  have  their\r\n\r\nyearly work permits renewed on a three-yearly basis\r\n\r\non   the  recommendation  of  their  employers.  In\r\n\r\naddition,   they   will  also   be   eligible   for\r\n\r\nconsideration  for  permanent  residence  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod of five years. This, we hope, will encourage\r\n\r\nthose  who  would  be an asset to  the  country  to\r\n\r\nremain in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I think the Minister's reply is reasonable  as\r\n\r\nwe  feel  that  there  is  a  shortage  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.

For example, the\r\n\r\nroutes  of  the bus services have been extended  to\r\n\r\ncut  down the necessity to change buses. These  are\r\n\r\nvery  good  measures. But in  spite  of  all  these\r\n\r\nimprovements,  there  are still  some  shortcomings\r\n\r\nwhich merit our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, buses fail to keep to their schedule. We\r\n\r\nhave received many complaints from the public about\r\n\r\nthis, and I myself have seen that at many bus stops\r\n\r\nthere are always crowds. The complaints are that  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  people have to wait for more than half  an\r\n\r\nhour  for a bus, resulting in their being late  for\r\n\r\nwork.  At  other times, half a dozen or more  buses\r\n\r\nwill  arrive at the same time, as if they are on  a\r\n\r\nrampage, thus causing traffic congestion. This is a\r\n\r\nserious  situation,  and it is  my  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister will take immediate and effective measures\r\n\r\nto remedy this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are many accidents involving\r\n\r\nbuses.  Over  the past year, we can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of accidents involving buses is increasing.\r\n\r\nMany people have been injured or even killed on the\r\n\r\nroads  because of such accidents. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the causes for such an increase  in  the\r\n\r\naccident rate? Is it because of the poor driving of\r\n\r\nthe  bus drivers, or because of lack of experience,\r\n\r\nor  because of some other reasons? Or is it because\r\n\r\nbuses  are too old and the engines are not in  good\r\n\r\ncondition?  I hope the Minister will take  measures\r\n\r\nto improve this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should take immediate steps to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  over-aged buses are replaced. I remember\r\n\r\nthat  in  April 1971 when the White  Paper  on  the\r\n\r\nReorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  was\r\n\r\npublished,  the Minister explained in great  detail\r\n\r\nhow  a  time-table would be provided in  which  old\r\n\r\nbuses  would  be replaced gradually. Every  year  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of  old buses  would  be  replaced\r\n\r\naccording  to  a time-table. But in spite  of  that\r\n\r\ntime-table we still see old \"bone-shakers\"  on  the\r\n\r\nroad. There are many breakdowns of old buses on the\r\n\r\nroad,  and  some  bus  drivers  would  just  put  a\r\n\r\ntriangular Safety sign at the tail-end of  the  bus\r\n\r\nand walk off leaving the bus behind for display. As\r\n\r\na  result of such breakdowns, traffic congestion is\r\n\r\nfrequently  seen on the road. I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan  tell this House whether the replacement of old\r\n\r\nbuses  has been carried out according to the  time-table,  which  is  to  ensure that  old  buses  are\r\n\r\nreplaced   completely   in  due   course,   thereby\r\n\r\nimproving our public bus services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the attitude of bus conductors\r\n\r\nshould  be improved. We have read in the newspapers\r\n\r\nmany  complaints  about  the  trouble  between  bus\r\n\r\nconductors and passengers. Many people have written\r\n\r\nto   the  newspapers  to  complain  that  there  is\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy  on  the  part of  bus  conductors.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  explanations have been given  by  the  bus\r\n\r\nconductors, and there have also been accusations by\r\n\r\nbus  conductors  against  passengers.  We  are  not\r\n\r\narbiters in such disputes. In any case, it  is  bad\r\n\r\nto   hear  of  disputes  and  trouble  between  bus\r\n\r\nconductors and passengers, no matter who  is  right\r\n\r\nor  wrong.  It may be due to some misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nBut  bad impression is created for tourists because\r\n\r\nof  these disputes. It is my view that the Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned should hold consultations with the unions\r\n\r\nof bus workers and the Association of Bus Employers\r\n\r\nfor the general improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the services provided by the bus workers. We can\r\n\r\nhold  courtesy campaigns and training  courses  for\r\n\r\nthe bus workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next point I wish to raise\r\n\r\nis the improvement of telephone services. Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  telephones  arc  a  common  feature   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They are even available  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  However,  the popularity of  telephones  in\r\n\r\nSingapore does not mean that our telephone services\r\n\r\nare  efficient.  We all have this experience,  Sir.\r\n\r\nVery often, we cannot get through a call because of\r\n\r\nsome  faulty  lines, particularly when  a  call  is\r\n\r\nbeing  made to Government Ministries, for  example,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nor  even the Ministry of Communications itself.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a Ministry of Communications which cannot  be\r\n\r\ncommunicated with! Sometimes when I try  to  put  a\r\n\r\ncall through to these Ministries, it would take  me\r\n\r\nmore than half an hour to do so. As the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  I have to make a number of calls  every\r\n\r\nday in order to get in touch with either the branch\r\n\r\nofficials  or the Management Committee  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Citizens' Consultative Committee because  many\r\n\r\nmatters have to be attended to. Very often  I  have\r\n\r\ntried  to  get a call through for half an hour  and\r\n\r\neven  then I might not get through. After  dialling\r\n\r\n5-0, I cannot get beyond that number. In some other\r\n\r\ninstances,  I cannot get through when  I  dial  the\r\n\r\nlast  digit.  It  may  well be  that  the  line  is\r\n\r\nengaged.  But  sometimes before  I  could  complete\r\n\r\ndialling  the  number, I would not get  the  proper\r\n\r\nsignal.  Other  than the fact that  the  lines  are\r\n\r\nengaged,  what is the explanation for my not  being\r\n\r\nable to get through a line after dialling the first\r\n\r\ndigit?  I  hope  the Minister will  look  into  the\r\n\r\ncauses   of   these  breakdowns  in  our  telephone\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  intend  to raise has already  been  partly\r\n\r\ncovered  by the Member for Sembawang. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  share his views  that  our  bus\r\n\r\nservices have indeed deteriorated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince the reorganisation of the bus services\r\n\r\nin   April  last  year.  There  are  more  frequent\r\n\r\nbreakdowns of buses, and more buses are involved in\r\n\r\naccidents.   As   mentioned  by  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  this may be due to the recklessness  on\r\n\r\nthe part of bus drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To emphasise the seriousness of these accidents I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to enumerate a few accidents  which  I\r\n\r\nmyself have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two buses ran off the road in Toa Payoh as they\r\n\r\nwere  coming out from the depot. One bus overturned\r\n\r\nwhen  taking the bend at the circus in  Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nThese  accidents occurred three days in succession.\r\n\r\nRecently one bus rammed into the Toa Payoh flyover.\r\n\r\nI  also  witnessed an accident in which  two  buses\r\n\r\nwere  sandwiching a small Fiat Marvellette in Upper\r\n\r\nBukit Timah Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, firstly, that the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  should take more adequate  measures\r\n\r\nto  prevent loss of life or serious injury  to  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters.  Secondly,  I would  also  suggest  that\r\n\r\nheavier  penalties  be imposed on  bus  owners  for\r\n\r\nfailure  to maintain the buses in proper condition,\r\n\r\nwhich  could  lead  to frequent breakdowns.  Checks\r\n\r\nshould   also  be  made, on  the  bus   companies'\r\n\r\nworkshops  to  ascertain that they are sufficiently\r\n\r\nequipped to handle repairs and maintenance of their\r\n\r\nvehicles.   Thirdly,  there  should   be   adequate\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff to maintain and man the workshops.\r\n\r\nAnd, in connection with accidents, severe penalties\r\n\r\nshould be imposed on drivers involved in accidents,\r\n\r\nsuch as a longer suspension of their licences. This\r\n\r\nmay  to  a  certain  extent deter  them  from  rash\r\n\r\ndriving.  Imposition  of fines,  as  has  been  the\r\n\r\npractice, is not a sufficient deterrent so far, and\r\n\r\nwe  find that more and more drivers are reckless in\r\n\r\ntheir  driving. It is not uncommon  to  see  a  bus\r\n\r\nfollowing closely behind you, possibly about a foot\r\n\r\naway from your car, and stepping on the accelerator\r\n\r\nas  though it is breathing down your necks. I think\r\n\r\nthis behaviour on the part of bus drivers should be\r\n\r\nstopped. I fully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport   the  point  raised  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang  for more effective control  of  our  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers as well as bus operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  aware  of the  deteriorating  urban\r\n\r\ntraffic  situation.  It has, in  the  recent  past,\r\n\r\nintroduced measures to improve the public transport\r\n\r\nservices  and  to  retard the  increasing  rate  of\r\n\r\nprivate  car  ownership and usage with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nachieving  a  more balanced traffic situation.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the White Paper on the Reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe Motor Transport Services in 1970 and the recent\r\n\r\nMinisterial statement introducing increases in road\r\n\r\ntax   on   private  cars  are  highly   commendable\r\n\r\nmeasures,  but  they alone do not provide  a  total\r\n\r\nsolution to the urban transportation problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the public transport service has greatly\r\n\r\nimproved  since the last reorganisation, there  are\r\n\r\nstill many shortcomings. We should not forget  that\r\n\r\nbus commuters have to walk from their homes or from\r\n\r\nwherever  they are to the bus stops, and having  to\r\n\r\nwait  for  the buses under local climatic condition\r\n\r\nis an experience which we all know what it is like.\r\n\r\nMany  bus  stops  are  still without  any  form  of\r\n\r\nshelter.   As  a  representative  from   a   highly\r\n\r\nurbanised domestic constituency, I would be failing\r\n\r\nin  my  duty if I do not bring to the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that there are only about a dozen bus\r\n\r\nshelters in the whole of Toa Payoh New Town,  which\r\n\r\npresently houses some 100,000 people. Some of  them\r\n\r\nhave  been  living  there since 1965  and  1966.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  any reason why we should  continue  to\r\n\r\nallow  our fellow bus commuters to be subjected  to\r\n\r\nthe  dangers, humiliation and inconveniences  which\r\n\r\nmost of them are facing today. I would like to  see\r\n\r\nthe  Government put in more effort to make the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters'   journey   less  miserable   and   less\r\n\r\ndangerous  by providing proper and safe  pedestrian\r\n\r\nfootways  either  along the  ground,  overhead,  or\r\n\r\nunderpass   and   also  providing  sufficient   bus\r\n\r\nshelters,  especially in highly  populated  housing\r\n\r\nestates, within the earliest possible time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that there is a study currently in\r\n\r\nprogress   to   advise  the   Government   on   the\r\n\r\nfeasibility  of introducing the Mass Rapid  Transit\r\n\r\nSystem.  The  failure  or  success  of  the  system\r\n\r\ndepends  very  much upon the rate of  switching  of\r\n\r\ncommuters  from  buses to private cars  before  the\r\n\r\nMass  Rapid  Transit System is put into  operation.\r\n\r\nExperience  elsewhere  has indicated  that  once  a\r\n\r\ncommuter   has   experienced   the   comfort    and\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  travelling in a  private  car,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  extremely difficult to persuade  him  to\r\n\r\ngive up his car and to travel in a bus or in a Mass\r\n\r\nRapid  Transit  System. Even if we  are  eventually\r\n\r\ngoing to have a Mass Rapid Transit System, we would\r\n\r\nstill  have  to  provide  good  and  efficient  bus\r\n\r\nservices  to  supplement  the  Mass  Rapid  Transit\r\n\r\nSystem  to  form  a totally balanced transportation\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is estimated that the total revenue from\r\n\r\nroad  tax and motor vehicle registration alone  for\r\n\r\nthe  coming financial year will amount to some  $73\r\n\r\nmillion.  However,  the  vote  allocated   in   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates  for  the  construction  and\r\n\r\nimprovement  of roads and bridges total  less  than\r\n\r\n$23  million. Of this figure, only half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars has been set aside for the provision of bus\r\n\r\nbays, bus shelters, vehicle parks, road-side curbs,\r\n\r\netc.  This  is  obviously  grossly  inadequate.  It\r\n\r\nappears   that   there  should  be   no   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in ploughing back more funds  from  the\r\n\r\nRevenue  for  the provision of bus  shelters,  foot\r\n\r\nbridges  and  other facilities for  the  commuters.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Ministry of Communications  is  looking\r\n\r\nafter   the  public  transport  services  and   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development is responsible for\r\n\r\nthe  construction of bus shelters, foot bridges and\r\n\r\nfootways etc., I would suggest that there should be\r\n\r\ncloser co-ordination between the two Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during last year's Budget debate, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications quoted the  conclusion\r\n\r\nof a critical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narticle from the New Nation, and I like to quote it\r\n\r\nagain [Hansard, Vol 31, No. 12, cols. 806-7]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would also be nice to bear in mind that\r\n\r\nSingapore has the best public transportation system\r\n\r\nin the region, if not the whole of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tax-paying public can rejoice in the fact\r\n\r\nthat it is also one of the few-non-Government-owned\r\n\r\nnon-subsidized services in the world.  It  makes  a\r\n\r\nprofit!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that our bus commuters\r\n\r\ngive  their continued support and patronage of  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport service, for which  they  deserve\r\n\r\ncomfort  and  convenience, and  that  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprofits  made  by these bus operators  is  ploughed\r\n\r\nback to serve the bus commuters, I wonder if I  can\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Minister for Communications to  look\r\n\r\ninto the possibility of requiring bus operators  to\r\n\r\nmake  financial  contributions in  future  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of bus shelters along new service routes,\r\n\r\nas an integral part of their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, under this amendment, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  two questions. The first question  is  about\r\n\r\ntrunk  calls.  I  understand that many  businessmen\r\n\r\nhave  complained that trunk calls take a long  time\r\n\r\nbefore  they  can  get a connection.  Sometimes  it\r\n\r\ntakes three to four hours. And sometimes when trunk\r\n\r\ncalls have been booked in advance, they do not  get\r\n\r\nany  reply.  When they inquired from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board, they found that the operator  had\r\n\r\nforgotten about the booking. Perhaps the staff  are\r\n\r\noverworked,  so  much so in some  cases  they  have\r\n\r\nforgotten about the bookings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that Singapore is going to be a\r\n\r\nregional  financial  and  industrial  centre   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, the communications link between overseas\r\n\r\ncountries  and  Singapore must  be  maintained  and\r\n\r\nimproved.  Part  of this is, of course,  the  trunk\r\n\r\ncall service. I hope that this inadequacy will  not\r\n\r\nhandicap  the  development of our country  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  I  would like to know what  the  Minister\r\n\r\nproposes  to do to improve our overseas trunk  call\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is in regard to the telephone\r\n\r\nservice  in  Jurong.  We know that  Jurong  is  our\r\n\r\nlargest  industrial  estate. There  are  about  400\r\n\r\nfactories  in  full production. But  the  telephone\r\n\r\nservice in Jurong has not improved very much.  This\r\n\r\nis particularly obvious in the mornings between the\r\n\r\nhours  of 10 a.m, and 12 noon. Very often we cannot\r\n\r\nget  our calls through. This is the peak period.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  what  plans the Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard  has  to  improve  the telephone  service  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

If\r\n\r\nindeed  we have a system that is somewhat short  of\r\n\r\nideal,  it  is  only a reflection of what  we  have\r\n\r\nexisting in Singapore, and that I take to mean more\r\n\r\nthan  just  the bus service. We have at  fault  the\r\n\r\nordinary  bus driver, the ordinary vehicle  driver,\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary lorry driver and the pedestrians.  If\r\n\r\nwe  want  to teach the bus drivers to drive better,\r\n\r\nwe  must  also  at the same time try  to  inculcate\r\n\r\nbetter driving habits in other drivers as well, and\r\n\r\nour  pedestrians  too.

I feel that generally such a  difficulty\r\n\r\nexists. Usually when people try to make trunk calls\r\n\r\noverseas, they find that they cannot get through in\r\n\r\na  short  time  in  order to communicate  with  the\r\n\r\npersons  abroad. Even when there is a  booking  for\r\n\r\nthe trunk call, they cannot get their calls through\r\n\r\nat  the scheduled time.

I would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest to the Minister to look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter in order to rectify the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considering the number of\r\n\r\nMembers  who have commented on the bus services  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  may I begin by saying that my  Ministry\r\n\r\nis not complacent about the state of affairs of our\r\n\r\nbus  services, although we feel that ever since the\r\n\r\nreorganisation which took place two years  ago,  we\r\n\r\ncan  say  that there has been quite an  improvement\r\n\r\nover   previous  years.  There  are  many   factors\r\n\r\npertaining  to the public bus services  which  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  be looked into before we pass any comments\r\n\r\nor  criticise without knowing the actual background\r\n\r\nand history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two years ago, before introducing the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the bus  services,  we  had  to\r\n\r\ncontend  with getting about 8,000 to 10,000  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis off the roads and to get the bus companies to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  vacuum  once they were  off  the  roads.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty, which perhaps we may lose sight\r\n\r\nof,  is the fact that after having reorganised  the\r\n\r\nbus services in April 1971, which is just less than\r\n\r\ntwo  years ago, one great casualty occurred in that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Traction Company collapsed. It is all\r\n\r\nvery well, now that everything is over, for you  to\r\n\r\nforget how tragic this event actually was. It  was,\r\n\r\nnow  that it is all over, a very large company with\r\n\r\n$14 million paid-up capital, employing nearly 3,000\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  reorganisation  brought  about   the\r\n\r\ncollapse  of this company and 400 of its buses  had\r\n\r\nto  be  taken over by the other three companies.  A\r\n\r\ngreat  number  of  these 400 buses  are  derelicts.\r\n\r\nToday,  very  often  we see  them  in  a  state  of\r\n\r\nbreakdown  on our roads. But what is most important\r\n\r\nwas  the  fact that nearly 3,000 workers  were  not\r\n\r\nunemployed. They were given employment by the other\r\n\r\nthree  bus  companies without any single cent  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government. These were private companies which\r\n\r\nrose to the occasion. So, to be fair to these three\r\n\r\ncompanies,  let us not keep saying that  they  have\r\n\r\nnot played their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the hon. Member for Kim Keat took\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to quote what I said last year from\r\n\r\na  newspaper  article.  The reason  I  quoted  that\r\n\r\narticle  was  just that here was a newspaper  which\r\n\r\nprobed  into  the  matter and  came  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nconclusion. It is true that the three bus companies\r\n\r\nmanaged to make a profit, whereas the STC which had\r\n\r\na  monopoly  of the bus services for umpteen  years\r\n\r\nshowed  losses  of  over $5 million.  To  be  fair,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I would say the three bus companies took\r\n\r\nover  this  bankrupt bus company of 400  buses  and\r\n\r\nnearly 3,000 workers into their midst; and they are\r\n\r\nrunning  it to the best of their ability.  We  must\r\n\r\ngive  them time to re-adjust to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is only just one year since they have been given\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity,  before we begin  to  criticise.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be given time to earn the revenue  with\r\n\r\nwhich they can buy more new buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion by the hon. Member for Kim\r\n\r\nKeat that perhaps the profits from these three  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  should  be used for  building  more  bus\r\n\r\nshelters  is  a good one. But I would  prefer  that\r\n\r\ntheir profits, if any, should be ploughed back  for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of more new buses because the question\r\n\r\nof erection of bus shelters rightfully falls on the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  fact,  it  is  the  Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  that  handles this. I  agree  that  not\r\n\r\nenough  bus  shelters  are being  provided  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment. But here again let  us  give  them\r\n\r\nsome  time  to  allow money to be  properly  spent,\r\n\r\nbecause there is still a period of adjustment.  The\r\n\r\npresent  bus shelter sites are not necessarily  the\r\n\r\nbest. They may have to be moved. So we do not  want\r\n\r\nto  tear  down $30,000 worth of bus shelters  today\r\n\r\nand then move them elsewhere in a few months' time.\r\n\r\nI  think it is a question of time really before  we\r\n\r\ncan  bring about a state of affairs of which we can\r\n\r\nbe  proud. But I do ask for time to be fair to  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that whilst they may\r\n\r\nappear  to show some profits - I must confess  that\r\n\r\nup  to  today, my Ministry has not received audited\r\n\r\naccounts of these three bus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  - I have asked for monthly figures,  and\r\n\r\non  the  face of those figures, I believe they  are\r\n\r\nmaking  a  profit. I suppose only  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  can tell us the truth. And  I  have  no\r\n\r\nrecourse to those documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, criticisms have been levelled and 1\r\n\r\nthink  it  is only fair that I should endeavour  to\r\n\r\ngive an explanation as best I can. Let me say again\r\n\r\nthat we are not smug or satisfied with what we have\r\n\r\nachieved. We think there is still a long way to  go\r\n\r\nand  much  has to be done. But there are priorities\r\n\r\nand  I do plead for some patience. Let me say  that\r\n\r\nover  the last year, two of the three bus companies\r\n\r\nwere  owing  Government taxes, one as  much  as  $1\r\n\r\nmillion, and the other $1/2 million. And it is only\r\n\r\nafter talking to them and pleading with them,  that\r\n\r\ntheir  accounts had been brought up to-date.  So  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that we are keeping a very close  watch,\r\n\r\nand I think the hon. Member for Boon Teck knows the\r\n\r\nposition  best. He has been able to get all  10,000\r\n\r\nbus  workers to join his union, SILO,  and  it  was\r\n\r\nonly  in  December 1972 that all bus  workers  came\r\n\r\nunder  one  union for the first time and they  were\r\n\r\nable  to  get  a  fair  deal  from  the  three  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Here  again,  first  things  must  come\r\n\r\nfirst. The 10,000 bus workers should feel that they\r\n\r\nare  getting  a good deal as a result  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices reorganisation. They never had a chance in\r\n\r\nthe past. You must have a group of happy, satisfied\r\n\r\nworkers,  before  you can have a  good  public  bus\r\n\r\nsystem.  So I must allow for these things  to  move\r\n\r\nstep by step. I think, this year, we should be able\r\n\r\nto  see  more new buses on the roads, and  all  the\r\n\r\nbroken-down buses, known as low ya chia,  will  not\r\n\r\nbe found on our streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the various criticisms\r\n\r\nlevelled  against them. The Members  who  spoke  of\r\n\r\ntheir dissatisfaction with the bus services are the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  Sembawang, Toa Payoh, Kim  Keat,  and\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir. I think the Member for Kim Seng  very\r\n\r\ngallantly supported the need to be a bit fair,  and\r\n\r\nI am very grateful to him for that. But we have got\r\n\r\nto take other things into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  hon.  Member for  Jalan  Kayu  is  very\r\n\r\nunhappy  that  old  buses are  made  to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountryside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards time schedules for buses and commuters\r\n\r\nhaving to wait a very long time before they can get\r\n\r\non  to a bus, there are many factors. Congestion of\r\n\r\nthe  roads can bring this about. I am sure everyone\r\n\r\nin Singapore knows that traffic today has increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably, and with congestion time schedules of\r\n\r\nbuses  are naturally upset. Sometimes we see three,\r\n\r\nfour, five or even six buses all \"bunching up\".  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it would be simple to say that bus drivers\r\n\r\nsomehow  or other make it a habit to come together,\r\n\r\nas  if  coming for a meeting! It is not true.  When\r\n\r\nthere  is congestion, all time schedules are  upset\r\n\r\nand so at a certain point of time all the buses are\r\n\r\nthere.  So  I do not think we should say  that  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  are unco-operative, and that they  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to care for passengers. Sometimes people seem\r\n\r\nto  pay too much attention to letters in the press.\r\n\r\nBut  we do know that some of those letters are  not\r\n\r\ngenuine. This can happen. We do not deny that  such\r\n\r\na state of affairs can exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, congestion is a problem. We hope we can\r\n\r\ntackle this in a number of ways. One way will be  a\r\n\r\nlong-term solution, which is the possibility  of  a\r\n\r\nmass  rapid transit system. That is a subject under\r\n\r\nstudy,  as  mentioned by the hon.  Member  for  Kim\r\n\r\nKeat.  But it will take time for a decision  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken.  It is for the long-term. Even if we make  a\r\n\r\ndecision  today, it will perhaps be five, eight  or\r\n\r\n10  years before we can see the mass rapid  transit\r\n\r\nsystem  operating  in Singapore.  However,  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  the bus companies to introduce express  bus\r\n\r\nservices  for commuters from large housing  estates\r\n\r\nto  their work areas. This is not something new. It\r\n\r\nhas been done in the past by the STC in city areas.\r\n\r\nThe  bus  companies  have agreed  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nmatter, and I think they would themselves be  quite\r\n\r\nhappy to bring this about. But here again we should\r\n\r\ngive them time to work things out before putting it\r\n\r\nreally into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of accident rates, there are so\r\n\r\nmany factors. If the roads are congested, then  the\r\n\r\nchances of accidents occurring are greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recklessness, it is not a question of\r\n\r\nbus  drivers only but drivers of all types of motor\r\n\r\nvehicles.  We do have an Enforcement Section  which\r\n\r\nattends  to  complaints of  this  nature,  and  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters themselves can help to stop the dangerous\r\n\r\npractice  of  buses  pulling off before  passengers\r\n\r\nhave  boarded or alighted by giving the particulars\r\n\r\nof  the incident when reporting to the Registrar of\r\n\r\nVehicles. It is not enough to say: `I saw this  bus\r\n\r\ndo this and that'. Please let us have more details,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the number of the bus concerned, and  the\r\n\r\ntime and date, so that we will be able to follow up\r\n\r\non those reports. Where a complaint is proved to be\r\n\r\ngenuine, then the bus driver or conductor  will  be\r\n\r\npulled up. But to make general statements will  not\r\n\r\nbe  of  much  help. The ROV Inspection Centre  also\r\n\r\nconducts field inspections, and they will follow up\r\n\r\ncases when we have more evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of over-aged buses, ever\r\n\r\nsince  we  reorganised the bus  services  in  April\r\n\r\n1971,  less  than  two years  ago,  the  three  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  have replaced about 290 buses  of  their\r\n\r\nown.  As  for the bus fleet itself, this  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  from  1,339 in April 1970,  three  years\r\n\r\nago,  to  2,103 buses as at the end of last January\r\n\r\n1973, i.e, an increase of 764 buses. Now if we  add\r\n\r\nup  these two figures, 290 plus 764, there has been\r\n\r\nan  increase of 1,054 new buses on the roads within\r\n\r\nthe last few years. And what is the total bus fleet\r\n\r\nin Singapore today? 2,000. One-half of the fleet is\r\n\r\nnew,  over the last two or three years. And  if  we\r\n\r\nwork  on the basis that each bus costs $40,000,  we\r\n\r\ncan arrive at what is the capital sum that has been\r\n\r\ninvested  on these 1,000 buses. It is $40  million.\r\n\r\nWe  do not just produce $40 million from thin  air.\r\n\r\nIt has got to come from somewhere. So we should not\r\n\r\npush  it  too  hard. The companies themselves  know\r\n\r\nthat an old bus, or a bus that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroken down, means less revenue for them. They will\r\n\r\nof  their own accord replace old buses as  fast  as\r\n\r\nthey can, even without intervention on our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the lack of so-called courtesy on the\r\n\r\npart  of drivers and conductors. Here, I think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Boon Teck can tell us how hard  he  has\r\n\r\nworked.  The first courtesy campaign was  organised\r\n\r\nbetween  the bus companies and bus workers.  I  had\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  of  being present  at  the  opening\r\n\r\nceremony.  This was done for the first time.  There\r\n\r\nnever  was  an occasion before where employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers    combined    their   efforts    together.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  of  course, the companies  did  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  cost a bit too much, for the results.  So\r\n\r\nthey are a bit shy about repeating it. I mean,  let\r\n\r\nus  be  fair.  People are not going to spend  money\r\n\r\nonly  to  find that the results are not  worth  the\r\n\r\nmoney  spent. So it does not mean that  nothing  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done.  We want to see more new buses  rather\r\n\r\nthan  all  the ramshackle buses serving  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards cleanliness and smoky exhausts, as\r\n\r\nbrought up by the Member for Potong Pasir,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that this has been done. On air pollution, may\r\n\r\nI  just  say  that  air pollution  is  a  very  big\r\n\r\nsubject.  There is such a thing as pollution  which\r\n\r\nyou  do  not  see but which constitutes  a  greater\r\n\r\ndanger. For example, pollution from petrol engines.\r\n\r\nThe  pollution that you see is a lesser evil. Smoky\r\n\r\nexhaust, which is visible pollution, is really  the\r\n\r\nlesser  evil. We have attempted to tackle only  the\r\n\r\nlesser  evil.  I  do  not say  that  we  have  been\r\n\r\ncompletely successful, but I think there is less of\r\n\r\nsmoky  exhaust in Singapore today. As  regards  the\r\n\r\ngreater evil of pollution by petrol driven  cars  - we  do  not  manufacture those cars, but  they  are\r\n\r\nmanufactured in the United States of  America  -  I\r\n\r\nthink  President Nixon has asked that by 1975  cars\r\n\r\nwith  a  minimum amount of pollution will  only  be\r\n\r\nallowed  on the roads. That is something that  will\r\n\r\nstretch not only our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinances but also our imagination. I hope  that  if\r\n\r\nwe have succeeded in reducing visible pollution, we\r\n\r\nwould  have already gone some way towards our fight\r\n\r\nfor a cleaner atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clean buses, it is expected of them.\r\n\r\nBut  as  one  Member himself has already indicated,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we should try to persuade the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe PUB to allow more water to be used for cleaning\r\n\r\nof  buses. So you can see the difficulties we  have\r\n\r\nto face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have covered most of the grouses in\r\n\r\nrespect of the bus services, and may I then move on\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore Telephone Board and the Overseas\r\n\r\nTelecoms  Service,  which is  being  handled  by  a\r\n\r\nseparate  authority,  at  present  known   as   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Authority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first deal with the Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard. The Members for Sembawang, Jurong and  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  have  complained about the  difficulty  of\r\n\r\ngetting through a telephone call. First of all,  it\r\n\r\nis  the  rapid  development of  our  own  telephone\r\n\r\nservices.  Normal developments in  other  countries\r\n\r\nwould  be  perhaps 5 per cent per  annum.  Ours  is\r\n\r\neasily  15,  20 or even 30 per cent per  annum.  At\r\n\r\nthis  rate of development, it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\ncatch  up with the provision of services of a  high\r\n\r\nstandard.  There  is  generally  a  breakdown.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we do not wish for this to happen,  but  we\r\n\r\nare  doing our best. May I say that in this respect\r\n\r\nwe  were  let  down by a firm of manufacturers  for\r\n\r\ntelephone equipment. I will name it. It is the L.M.\r\n\r\nEricsson  of  Sweden. As a result of a contract  to\r\n\r\nprovide  equipment, we entered into a joint venture\r\n\r\nto manufacture telephone equipment in Singapore, to\r\n\r\nbe  known  as the Telephone Industries of Singapore\r\n\r\nPte.  Ltd.  At the end of 1971, just  when  it  was\r\n\r\nsupposed to start manufacturing, this company  L.M.\r\n\r\nEricsson,  decided not to go on with  the  project.\r\n\r\nThat  upset  our  plans and also  the  delivery  of\r\n\r\nequipment  all  the way from Sweden.  This  problem\r\n\r\nwent  on for quite some time, and you may have read\r\n\r\nin the newspapers very recently that we have signed\r\n\r\na contract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  a  well-known firm of manufacturers in Japan,\r\n\r\nknown   as  Fujitsu,  for  the  supply  of  100,000\r\n\r\ntelephones.  So  if we do have some  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nservice in certain exchanges, it is partly  due  to\r\n\r\nthis  unfortunate  decision on  the  part  of  L.M.\r\n\r\nEricsson  not  to proceed with the  joint  venture,\r\n\r\nwhich  resulted  in  withholding  the  delivery  of\r\n\r\nequipment, etc, by them. So we were in a bit  of  a\r\n\r\njam,   but  that  has  been  put  right  now.  Past\r\n\r\ncontracts for delivery are now in the pipeline  and\r\n\r\nwe have also changed our contractors. In due course\r\n\r\nit  should  be  possible to improve  our  telephone\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the fact that our\r\n\r\noverseas telephone services are also very bad.  Our\r\n\r\noverseas telephone services have been increasing at\r\n\r\nthe average rate of 30 per cent per annum. Over the\r\n\r\nlast  six years, the development rate has been much\r\n\r\ntoo great for the personnel concerned, and there is\r\n\r\na  limit  to  human endeavour to meet with  such  a\r\n\r\nterrific   rate   of  increase.  As   stated,   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in meeting this growth was due  to  the\r\n\r\nequipment  manufacturer not meeting  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board orders placed before 1971.  A  new\r\n\r\norder  has since been placed with another supplier,\r\n\r\nand a new exchange equipment is now being installed\r\n\r\nand  will  be operational in August this  year,  in\r\n\r\nother words, five months from now. This will double\r\n\r\nthe  capacity of the existing exchange  in  Jurong,\r\n\r\nand congestion should then be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong also mentioned the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a telephone operator having forgotten  to\r\n\r\nput through a call. I would say, please let us have\r\n\r\nthe name, the time and date when this happened,  so\r\n\r\nthat whichever operator was then in charge could be\r\n\r\npulled  up.  I  would appreciate it if  the  Member\r\n\r\ncould supply me the particulars.

Phase  I  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  essentially with the  economic  aspects,\r\n\r\nand  includes the examination of existing transport\r\n\r\ndemands and services, forecasts of requirements for\r\n\r\ntransport  facilities, and the systematic  analyses\r\n\r\nand    comparisons    of   alternative    transport\r\n\r\ninvestments and policies. Phase II will deal mainly\r\n\r\nwith the engineering aspects and will consist of  a\r\n\r\ndetailed  feasibility  study  of  those  investment\r\n\r\nprojects   for   which   engineering   design    or\r\n\r\nconstruction  is  programmed to start  before  1977\r\n\r\nwithin the Mass Transit System recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies are being undertaken with the\r\n\r\nassistance   of  the  United  Nations   Development\r\n\r\nProgramme  (UNDP) and the World Bank  as  executive\r\n\r\nagency. The Mass Transit Study Office was set up in\r\n\r\nmid-June  1972  with  staff from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications  and  officers  seconded  from   the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department, the Planning  Department\r\n\r\nand the Housing and Development Board. For Phase  I\r\n\r\nof the study, the World Bank has appointed the firm\r\n\r\nof   Wilbur   Smith  and  Associates   to   provide\r\n\r\nprofessional   services.   The   consultants   were\r\n\r\nmobilised  in  Singapore  in  July  last  year.   A\r\n\r\nSteering  Committee has been established to  review\r\n\r\npolicy matters that might require decisions in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of their study. The Committee is chaired  by\r\n\r\nthe     Permanent    Secretary,     Ministry     of\r\n\r\nCommunications,  and includes representatives  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  area  of\r\n\r\nstudies  covers  the whole island of  Singapore.  A\r\n\r\nminimum   of  four  alternative  public   transport\r\n\r\nsystems  would be formulated and tested. The  study\r\n\r\nwill  also  estimate the comparative  magnitude  of\r\n\r\ninvestment,  because  it  runs  into  hundreds   of\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperating  costs  of the various alternatives.  The\r\n\r\nrelationship between travel demand and travel cost,\r\n\r\nand  the  effect of pricing policies, may  also  be\r\n\r\nexamined. The alternative Mass Transit Systems  are\r\n\r\nto  be compared and evaluated on the basis of cost,\r\n\r\nservice characterisation, the economic benefits and\r\n\r\nenvironmental  and social implications  leading  to\r\n\r\nthe   recommendation  of  a  system  for   detailed\r\n\r\nfeasibility  studies in Phase II. Phase  I  of  the\r\n\r\nStudy  is  scheduled for completion by the  end  of\r\n\r\nJune  this  year. In April, that is  to  say,  next\r\n\r\nmonth,   the   consultants   will   present   their\r\n\r\npreliminary  findings  and  recommendations  on   a\r\n\r\npreferred Mass Transit System and subsequently  the\r\n\r\nfinal  report.  When this report is  available,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it would go up to Cabinet for a  decision.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only when Cabinet decides that there should\r\n\r\nbe a Mass Transit System that we will get the money\r\n\r\nto get on with the job. I am afraid I might perhaps\r\n\r\nbe  somewhat optimistic when I say that in five  or\r\n\r\neight  years'  time  we shall  be  getting  a  Mass\r\n\r\nTransit System.

Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two questions under\r\n\r\nthis  amendment. First, it is the  matter  of  taxi\r\n\r\nservices at the Paya Lebar Airport. Secondly, it is\r\n\r\nthe  slowness  of  the  terminal  services  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport. Mr Speaker, Sir, Paya Lebar Airport is one\r\n\r\nof  the  busiest, if not the busiest,  airports  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  Everyday many  tourists  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   through  the  Singapore   International\r\n\r\nAirport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, more taxis should be made available at\r\n\r\nthe  Airport for the convenience of tourists.  Sir,\r\n\r\nat  present  there  are about 200  taxis  operating\r\n\r\nbetween   the   City  and  the  Airport   for   the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  tourists and others.  So  far  the\r\n\r\nservices  rendered  by these 200  taxis  are  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to mention that I have\r\n\r\nreceived   a  complaint  from  the  Taxi   Drivers'\r\n\r\nAssociation.   The  Association  applied   to   the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Civil Aviation for an office space  at\r\n\r\nthe  Airport  so  that  better  services  could  be\r\n\r\nprovided   for   the   tourists.   However,    this\r\n\r\napplication   was  turned  down  by   the   Airport\r\n\r\nmanagement.  There  is,  however,  an  office   for\r\n\r\noperators  of  SZ vehicles which are  for  hire  to\r\n\r\ntourists.  Since  both the SZ cars  and  taxis  are\r\n\r\nmeant  for the convenience of tourists, how  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  operators of SZ cars for hire have been given\r\n\r\nan  office space whilst operators of taxis have not\r\n\r\nbeen  given any office space? In fact, I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  taxi  drivers provide a  more  important\r\n\r\nservice  to the tourists. I wonder why the officer-in-charge  of  the Singapore International  Airport\r\n\r\ndid   not  approve  the  application  of  the  Taxi\r\n\r\nDrivers' Association. If the operators of taxis are\r\n\r\ngiven  some  office  space, then  there  is   some\r\n\r\nfairness. In fact, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be no discrimination between the two  types\r\n\r\nof  operators. I hope the Minister will  look  into\r\n\r\nthis   matter   and  ensure  that   there   is   no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  There should be  fair  competition\r\n\r\nbetween  the  taxis and SZ cars for hire.  We  must\r\n\r\nallow  both services to operate on an equal footing\r\n\r\nfor a fair competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point concerns the handling of luggage\r\n\r\nat  the  Airport. Sir, recently I have  received  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of complaints from tourists. Some  of  them\r\n\r\nare  my  friends.  They have  complained  that  the\r\n\r\nhandling  of  luggage  at  the  Airport  is   still\r\n\r\ninefficient  and slow. Passengers arriving  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport  have to wait for half an hour before  they\r\n\r\ncan  collect their luggage. The Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  that is not the case. Perhaps he should  send\r\n\r\nspecial  investigators  there  to  look  into   the\r\n\r\nmatter. If the handling of luggage is too slow,  it\r\n\r\nwill affect tourism in Singapore. The tourists will\r\n\r\nget a bad impression of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear from\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Sembawang that the representatives\r\n\r\nfrom the 200 taxis have applied to the Director  of\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation for an office space  and  that  the\r\n\r\napplication  has been turned down. I am  not  aware\r\n\r\neither of the application or its rejection. If  the\r\n\r\nSZ car operators have an office there, I cannot see\r\n\r\nany  good reason why taxi operators should not also\r\n\r\nbe  provided with an office. I shall therefore  ask\r\n\r\nfor this matter to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question about the delay in the\r\n\r\nhandling of baggage, there seems to be all sorts of\r\n\r\ncomplaints. However, they have not been directed to\r\n\r\nmy  office.  Whatever it is, I  think  it  is  fair\r\n\r\ncomment.  May I say that there will be a change  in\r\n\r\nthe management of the baggage handling services  at\r\n\r\nthe Airport. At the moment, the Department of Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  is handling the baggage for six airlines.\r\n\r\nBut  a  subsidiary of the Singapore Airlines, known\r\n\r\nas  the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS),\r\n\r\nwill  take  over the services from 1st April,  next\r\n\r\nmonth.  With  this  takeover,  there  will  be  one\r\n\r\nhandling authority,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  it  should therefore provide a more  efficient\r\n\r\nservice.

The chief medical adviser  of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Health Unit  in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour has very recently stressed the importance of\r\n\r\ncontrolling noise in the Republic. He claimed  that\r\n\r\nnoise  levels  up  to  90  decibels  is  considered\r\n\r\ndangerous,  as exposure over a number of  years  to\r\n\r\nsuch   levels  will  give  rise  to  a  number   of\r\n\r\nundesirable effects and consequences. Sir, many  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents  in urban areas, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nGeylang and Katong districts, are already suffering\r\n\r\nfrom aircraft noise of 80 to 100 decibels. Whenever\r\n\r\na  plane flies over, one would have to give up  his\r\n\r\ntelevision viewing, telephone conversation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor suspend his class temporarily.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  we  do not want to allow these conditions  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  any  further. In  this  connection,  I\r\n\r\nwonder if the Minister for Communications would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to categorically rule out the possibility\r\n\r\nof  extending  the existing airport runway  further\r\n\r\nsouthwards in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nMember  is  aware  that if the existing  runway  is\r\n\r\nextended  southwards, the noise pollution would  be\r\n\r\neven  greater for a larger number of people in  the\r\n\r\nKatong  area. But whatever it is, whether we extend\r\n\r\nit  southwards or northwards, I am afraid that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will have to contend with noise\r\n\r\npollution so long as Singapore remains an  aviation\r\n\r\ncentre.  After all, we are a small island  of  just\r\n\r\n224 square miles. I am afraid that this is part and\r\n\r\nparcel of our life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remedy perhaps would be for the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  to  begin  developing   aeronautical\r\n\r\nengines with lower decibels. I think this is  being\r\n\r\ndone.  For  example, the Rolls Royce  engine  which\r\n\r\npowers  the Lockheed Tri-Star is supposed to  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  quiet engine for its size. I believe all  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of aeronautical engines  are  working\r\n\r\ntowards that end. For example, people thought  that\r\n\r\nwhen the Boeing 747 Jumbo arrives in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nnoise of the engines would be too difficult to bear\r\n\r\nwith. In reality, it turned out to be no worse than\r\n\r\nthe  Boeing 707. So we hope that, in due course  of\r\n\r\ntime, engineers will be able to reduce the decibels\r\n\r\nof aircraft engines, so that people living close to\r\n\r\nairports will be less bothered by noise. That is as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I can go. Today I do not think I am  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  move the airport from Paya  Lebar  to\r\n\r\nsome  off-shore  island. I do  not  think  we  have\r\n\r\nenough space to move around. At the most, we  might\r\n\r\nhave to move to Changi. Then, of course, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  will stand up and say,  \"Why  come  to\r\n\r\nChangi?  Why  not go to Sembawang?\",  or  something\r\n\r\nlike that.

This\r\n\r\nis  because I have raised many criticisms last year\r\n\r\nin  the  House.  Only when there is  criticism  can\r\n\r\nthere  be  progress and improvement. The number  of\r\n\r\nletters  handled by the Postal Services  Department\r\n\r\ncomes  to  millions. The Postal Services Department\r\n\r\nis  efficient  and letters for local  delivery  are\r\n\r\nreceived  on the same day. Very seldom do  we  find\r\n\r\nletters   misplaced.  This  is  a  sign  that   the\r\n\r\nefficiency is pretty high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward a suggestion for the\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  the Minister.  Can  he  consider\r\n\r\nsetting  up a small post office in Kampung  Tengah,\r\n\r\n15 m.s., Sembawang? There are about 10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  living in the four kampungs in  that  area.\r\n\r\nThe  only  place  they can go to now  is  the  post\r\n\r\noffice  at the third milestone, which is about  two\r\n\r\nmiles  away from the kampungs. So if the  residents\r\n\r\ncan  go  to  this suggested post office in  Kampung\r\n\r\nTengah,  which will be nearer their homes, it  will\r\n\r\nbe so much more convenient for them. I am sure that\r\n\r\nthe  expenses involved in building the post  office\r\n\r\nwill  not  be very much. We need perhaps one  clerk\r\n\r\nand one jaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  understand   that   top\r\n\r\nofficers,   who  are  in  Division  I,  cannot   be\r\n\r\ntransferred to other departments of the  Government\r\n\r\nservice  because this has been the  practice  since\r\n\r\ncolonial  days. If this is true, then  if  officers\r\n\r\nare  allowed to be there too long they will  become\r\n\r\nstale  and  cannot foresee any way to  improve  the\r\n\r\nservice. The Postal Service is a great asset to the\r\n\r\nCommunications Ministry, and I recommend  that  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Service  be  given a  change  of  life.  If\r\n\r\nDivision  1 officers are interchangeable  from  one\r\n\r\nMinistry  to another, I am sure greater improvement\r\n\r\nin postal services will surely result and the needs\r\n\r\nof the public enhanced by this recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is growing. It is\r\n\r\ntherefore  true that if the postal  service  is  to\r\n\r\nkeep pace with the growth, more pillar boxes should\r\n\r\nbe  introduced.  This is not going  to  be  a  very\r\n\r\ncostly   item,  nor  is  it  going   to   be   very\r\n\r\ninconvenient  to  the postmen. Further,  the  metal\r\n\r\nplates  showing the collection times of many pillar\r\n\r\nboxes have either faded or been tampered with.  Yet\r\n\r\nno  action has been taken about it.

I notice  that  in  the  Postal\r\n\r\nServices  Department  a small  unit  known  as  the\r\n\r\nPhilatelic Bureau has been set up. This  Bureau  is\r\n\r\nmainly concerned with the sale of first-day covers.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Minister  of  State  for  Communications\r\n\r\nopened one of the stamp exhibitions, I remember  he\r\n\r\nmade a point with regard to encouraging more people\r\n\r\nto  acquire the habit of stamp collecting. I think,\r\n\r\nSir, this is very good encouragement, and it is  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect that I would like to see  this  small\r\n\r\nBureau expand its activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are several stamp collecting\r\n\r\ngroups  or clubs in some schools. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  this Bureau can give assistance  and\r\n\r\nguidance   to   schools  with   regard   to   stamp\r\n\r\ncollecting.  Stamp  collecting,  Sir,  is  a   very\r\n\r\ninteresting hobby because through the collection of\r\n\r\nstamps  school children will be able to  know  more\r\n\r\nabout  the countries from which they have collected\r\n\r\nstamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, may I ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  whether he will consider  expanding\r\n\r\nthe  Philatelic  Bureau with a  view  to  assisting\r\n\r\nschools to set up stamp collecting groups?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the\r\n\r\nhon.

I understand that Division  I\r\n\r\nposts  in  the  Postal  Department  are  graded  as\r\n\r\ndepartmental  posts. This means  that  they  are  a\r\n\r\nclosed  Service.

In addition,\r\n\r\ntwo improvement projects at a total cost of $59,000\r\n\r\nwere  recently approved by the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nThe  projects  provide  for  the  installation   of\r\n\r\nspecial  heat insulation material and  fibre  glass\r\n\r\nsound  insulation material for the roof  to  reduce\r\n\r\nheat, and for the installation of additional blower\r\n\r\nfans  and silencers to improve air circulation  and\r\n\r\nto  reduce  noise.

F. Conceicao, Sim Boon Woo and P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Registry of Vehicles undeniably is a\r\n\r\nvery  busy  department because it takes  charge  of\r\n\r\nnearly   470,000  motor  vehicles.   Its   function\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  registration of motor vehicles,  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  road taxes and the registration  or\r\n\r\ntransfer  of motor vehicles, inspection  of  taxis,\r\n\r\nand  other  related work, in the  past,  when  this\r\n\r\nDepartment  was under the Lim Yew Hock  Government,\r\n\r\nit  was  one of the departments most criticised  by\r\n\r\nthe public because the supervision of work was in a\r\n\r\nmess  at  that time. However, ever since our  Party\r\n\r\ncame to power we have tried our best to improve the\r\n\r\nrunning of this department. It cannot be denied now\r\n\r\nthat  this  department is run more efficiently  and\r\n\r\noutput  has  been raised to a greater extent.  Also\r\n\r\nthere  is improvement all round. However, there  is\r\n\r\nstill room for further improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two matters which I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  with the Minister. I hope he will look  into\r\n\r\nthem.  Firstly,  there  are many  people  who  have\r\n\r\ncomplained  that when they send their  vehicles  to\r\n\r\nthe   Registry  of  Vehicles  for  inspection,  the\r\n\r\ninspection   has  been  too  strict.  Certain   new\r\n\r\nvehicles after testing have been found to emit  too\r\n\r\nmuch smoke. Even new vehicles cannot pass the test,\r\n\r\nand  have to go through various tests again.  After\r\n\r\nseveral days they still cannot be passed. I do  not\r\n\r\ndeny  that  at the moment we are carrying  out  the\r\n\r\nanti-pollution campaign which involves paying close\r\n\r\nattention  to  the possibility of doing  away  with\r\n\r\nvehicles which emit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  much smoke. But all cars will emit smoke to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent.  In  view  of  this,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nofficers  in  charge will adopt a more  sympathetic\r\n\r\nattitude when testing new cars, and not just  apply\r\n\r\nthe  regulations  in  a very  strict  manner,  thus\r\n\r\ncausing suffering on the part of the car owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter relates to the inspection of\r\n\r\ntaxis   which  is  being  carried  out  even   more\r\n\r\nstrictly. Taxi drivers have to send their taxis for\r\n\r\ninspection  at the ROV when certain  parts  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxis  are  found to have corroded or when  certain\r\n\r\nparts  need replacement or repair. They cannot  get\r\n\r\nthrough  the  test as the procedure  is  also  very\r\n\r\nstrict.  Hence they do not get approval. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  brings about great difficulties to  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  because  their income is reduced  as  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  send their taxis for inspection again.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   Minister  can  consider   their   case\r\n\r\nsympathetically  and  apply a  certain  measure  of\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  help  them  clear  the  inspection\r\n\r\ntests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ndraw the attention of the Minister to the number of\r\n\r\nsecond-hand  motor  dealers whose  business  is  to\r\n\r\nimport second-hand trucks or lorry bodies. They re-condition   and   re-assemble   these   second-hand\r\n\r\nvehicles  and  then re-export them to  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  or sell them locally. Sir,  due  to  the\r\n\r\nrapid  growth of our trade and industry  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthese  re-conditioned vehicles  are  sold  locally.\r\n\r\nThose  sold  locally must have a weight certificate\r\n\r\nwhich  is  issued by only a few so-called qualified\r\n\r\nbig motor firms. The dealers must obtain the weight\r\n\r\ncertificates  first,  before  they  can  send   the\r\n\r\nvehicles   to   the   Registry  of   Vehicles   for\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these weight certificates are charged at $50\r\n\r\neach  by  the  big  motor firms.  The  dealers  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  faced with a lot of difficulties.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  having  to pay $50 for a weight  certificate,\r\n\r\nwhat is worse, Sir, is that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave to pay a few hundred dollars \"under the table\"\r\n\r\nto  the  person in charge for an early issue  of  a\r\n\r\nweight  certificate. Sir, if it is not paid,  these\r\n\r\nbig motor firms may ask them to wait for days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the ROV has appointed\r\n\r\nonly a few big motor firms to carry out the process\r\n\r\nof issuing weight certificates. The dealers told me\r\n\r\nthat they are prepared to pay the ROV about $200 to\r\n\r\n$300   per   vehicle  if  the   issue   of   weight\r\n\r\ncertificates for registration could be  dealt  with\r\n\r\ndirectly by the ROV. If this move is possible, then\r\n\r\nI  think  the Government will receive more  revenue\r\n\r\nfrom the ROV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, although some Members\r\n\r\nhave  already spoken about cars and buses,  I  have\r\n\r\nyet  to say something about them. The Minister will\r\n\r\nprobably only take note of my remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the daily traffic on our roads seems to be\r\n\r\nincreasing at an alarming rate. Is it possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  Government  offices  and  commercial\r\n\r\nfirms  to  co-operate with the  Traffic  Police  to\r\n\r\nstagger their working hours effectively so that our\r\n\r\nroads  do not become congested during peak periods?\r\n\r\nOr is it possible to close certain key roads in the\r\n\r\ncity  area  to  private vehicles  during  the  peak\r\n\r\nperiod?  This  will ease the flow  of  buses  which\r\n\r\ntransport  most  of the office workers  and  school\r\n\r\nchildren. In the meantime private vehicles could be\r\n\r\ndiverted  to  some other routes which are  not  too\r\n\r\nbusy during that period. I suggest that a study  be\r\n\r\nmade on this proposal and to implement it if it  is\r\n\r\nfeasible. At the rate our office workers experience\r\n\r\nthe daily traffic jams at the moment they will soon\r\n\r\nhave  bad lungs by inhaling the 5.00 p.m. dose  of\r\n\r\ncarbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. It is no wonder\r\n\r\nthat  our office workers do not seem to be  in  the\r\n\r\nleast rugged!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of box junctions is commendable.\r\n\r\nBut  I  wonder  how many persons  have  since  been\r\n\r\nbooked for ignoring the box junction rules. Some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers  seem to think that the yellow box junction\r\n\r\nis a chess board and they block traffic coming from\r\n\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our buses have earned such a notoriety that\r\n\r\nit will be recorded in the annals of Singapore. Not\r\n\r\nonly  do  the buses cough out poisonous  fumes  and\r\n\r\npollute  the air but they are the cause of  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of accidents in Singapore. Surely something\r\n\r\ncan  he done to remedy this increasingly deplorable\r\n\r\nsituation. We see daily the familiar triangle  sign\r\n\r\non  the road indicating that a bus has broken down.\r\n\r\nThis  has  become so common that one  has  only  to\r\n\r\ntravel  along  any  bus route to  see  broken  down\r\n\r\nbuses.  Either  these buses are not being  properly\r\n\r\nmaintained   or   the  owners  are  straining   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the vehicles to their utmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, inside the bus, it is not an uncommon\r\n\r\nsight to see the Seats damaged, litter bins without\r\n\r\na  bottom,  and used tickets thrown  all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace.  And  although  a litter  Bin  is  provided,\r\n\r\ncigarette  butts  can be seen  here  and  there.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether we can introduce a complete ban  on\r\n\r\nsmoking in buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our bus drivers and conductors are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have gone through a refresher  course,\r\n\r\nbut  of late instead of giving better service,  the\r\n\r\npublic  are  getting more and more  experiences  of\r\n\r\nrudeness   by  bus  drivers  and  conductors.   The\r\n\r\nnumerous letters written to the press regarding the\r\n\r\nbehaviour   of  bus  drivers  and  conductors   are\r\n\r\ntestimony  to this fact. Some bus drivers  seem  to\r\n\r\nthink that bus bays or bus stops are only meant for\r\n\r\nshow  and not for use by them. It is not infrequent\r\n\r\nto  see buses damaging road dividers and pedestrian\r\n\r\nwalks.  They will endanger the lives of road  users\r\n\r\nif   no   remedial  action  is  taken  immediately.\r\n\r\nMoreover, bus drivers often ignore commuters by not\r\n\r\nstopping  or stopping far away from the  bus  stops\r\n\r\nonly  to let down passengers and will not pick  any\r\n\r\npassengers at all. The passengers wait hopefully at\r\n\r\nthe  bus stops for the buses, but quite often their\r\n\r\nwait has been in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What positive action is being taken by the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Communications   to   bring   about\r\n\r\ndiscipline  in  our  public transport  system?  The\r\n\r\npublic  is  fed up and disgusted with the behaviour\r\n\r\nof  some of our bus drivers and conductors. I would\r\n\r\ncall  upon the Minister to set up an urgent inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter to find out why the  drivers  and\r\n\r\nconductors  are  deliberately  behaving   in   that\r\n\r\nmanner.  If necessary, it should recommend whatever\r\n\r\nbenefits  they deserve, such as more pay, in  order\r\n\r\nthat we may have a better transport service. It can\r\n\r\nalso  be  further  improved by the introduction  of\r\n\r\nmore new buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the growing number of vehicles on our\r\n\r\nroads  from year to year there is greater pollution\r\n\r\nof  air  and  noise, and the fumes emitted  by  the\r\n\r\nbuses,  lorries,  motor cars and motor  cycles  are\r\n\r\noffensive  and  poisonous to the people.  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  seriously  consider  enacting   laws   to\r\n\r\neliminate such pollution? One suggestion  would  be\r\n\r\nto enforce the compulsory installation of silencers\r\n\r\nto  all  motor  vehicles and the  compulsory  half-yearly inspection and overhaul of old vehicles.  If\r\n\r\nthis suggestion is carried out, Singapore will be a\r\n\r\nbetter  and  healthier place to live in.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nour vehicles seem to he literally getting away with\r\n\r\nblue murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the computerisation of vehicle records has\r\n\r\ncreated  a  mess  at the Registry  of  Vehicles  in\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road.  Not only is there no  one  to  guide\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public as to where to  queue,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is  also a racket going on by those  in  the\r\n\r\nqueue. What measures have the Registrar of Vehicles\r\n\r\ntaken  to  remedy the situation? It seems that  the\r\n\r\noffices on the ground floor of the Registry are not\r\n\r\nwell  sited.  All  this will project  an  image  of\r\n\r\ninefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I think I should answer\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson first.

I will therefore  attempt  to\r\n\r\nanswer the few new points that he has raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards air pollution, early last year we did\r\n\r\nintroduce restriction on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  petrol driven cars, that is, they should  have\r\n\r\nspecial crankcase devices, like after-burns,  which\r\n\r\nwill  therefore reduce air pollution.

However,  we  have  got\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  thousands of old cars,  and  it  will\r\n\r\ntherefore take time to replace them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the suggestion to reduce congestion\r\n\r\nby  the introduction of staggered hours for schools\r\n\r\nand  offices.  This was, in fact, proposed  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on the Reorganisation  of  the  Motor\r\n\r\nTransport Service for Singapore three years ago.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this can be quite upsetting as people  would\r\n\r\nhave  to change their present ways of life.  Nobody\r\n\r\nseems to be interested in changing routine, but  we\r\n\r\nhope  that  ultimately the schools and offices  may\r\n\r\nthink it desirable to introduce staggered hours for\r\n\r\nthe  staff and the school children. This  has  been\r\n\r\nfound   to  he  reasonably  effective  in   certain\r\n\r\ncountries. For example, in Germany the staff  could\r\n\r\nwalk  in  and clock the time they enter the office,\r\n\r\nand  leave at any time they wish provided they make\r\n\r\nup  the hours in other days. In fact, they can walk\r\n\r\nin and out of the office as they like provided they\r\n\r\ndo  their lot. They have found that this system  is\r\n\r\nvery   effective  from  the  point   of   view   of\r\n\r\nproductivity.  But I think this is only  applicable\r\n\r\nto  a  small number of progressive firms.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething   idealistic,  except,  of   course,   in\r\n\r\nCommunist  states. When I was in Leningrad,  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that the factories did have staggered working\r\n\r\nhours  and  workers could go to  the  factories  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  times,  at 7, 8, 9  or  10  o'clock.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  Leningrad there are not  many  private\r\n\r\ncars  on  the road, so that even without  staggered\r\n\r\nhours there is very little traffic on the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of explanation,\r\n\r\nSir,I  was  referring to heavy-duty  lorries  and\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, heavy-duty lorries\r\n\r\ncarrying  heavy  cargo  should  be  restricted   to\r\n\r\ncertain hours? I think that is a good point which I\r\n\r\nwill  ask the Registrar of Vehicles to look into  -\r\n\r\nthe suggestion to restrict the movement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  lorries. There will be a yell. And perhaps,  as\r\n\r\nadviser to the Singapore Lorry Owners' Association,\r\n\r\nI  will soon get a petition from them through  you,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion is the closing of certain\r\n\r\nroads during peak hours. This may help. There is  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  comprising  officials  from  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department,  the  Traffic  Police  and   the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Vehicles. Officials from these  three\r\n\r\ndepartments have formed what is known as  the  Road\r\n\r\nImprovement  Committee, and they are  looking  into\r\n\r\nthis  proposal. They have, in fact,  introduced  in\r\n\r\nAugust last year a special bus lane for buses along\r\n\r\nNew  Bridge Road. It is that stretch of road  close\r\n\r\nto Outram Road to the Havelock Road junction. It is\r\n\r\na very small stretch, perhaps 200 yards. But it has\r\n\r\nbeen  considered a success, and it is  likely  that\r\n\r\nmore  such bus lanes will be introduced, Even in  a\r\n\r\none-way  street, where other vehicles will have  to\r\n\r\nobey the one-way street sign, the buses are allowed\r\n\r\nto  go  against the traffic stream,  to  cut  short\r\n\r\ntheir  journey time and to avoid the  traffic  jam.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been proved successful in large  cities,\r\n\r\nincluding  London.  It is, therefore,  likely  that\r\n\r\nfrom   this   year  onwards,  we  shall   see   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of more special bus lanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on to the question raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Changi? If I heard him  correctly,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that it cost second-hand dealers $50 each  to\r\n\r\nget  what  is  known as a weight  certificate  from\r\n\r\ncertain motor firms, which have been authorised  by\r\n\r\nthe Registry of Vehicles, before they can either re-export  the  vehicles or re-sell them in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  has  questioned why the ROV has restricted  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  such certificates to just  a  few  large\r\n\r\nmotor   firms.  It  is,  therefore,  more  like   a\r\n\r\nmonopoly. What I am interested in is the allegation\r\n\r\nthat several hundreds of dollars have changed hands\r\n\r\n\"under the table\" to get things done. That, to  me,\r\n\r\nis  a very serious allegation, and I would like the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi to provide more evidence for  the\r\n\r\nCPIB to look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto.  I  do not think we can tolerate any  \"under\r\n\r\nthe  table\" gratification of, I presume,  officials\r\n\r\nin the ROV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Officials in the motor firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Even in the motor firms, I see\r\n\r\nno  reason why this should be done. I would be most\r\n\r\nhappy  indeed if the Member for Changi can  provide\r\n\r\ninformation  direct  to the CPIB  against  the  ROV\r\n\r\nofficials or even those in the motor firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am not complaining about\r\n\r\nthe ROV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am very glad indeed that it\r\n\r\nis  not the officials in the ROV. Otherwise I  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  very despondent Minister to know that  these\r\n\r\nthings are happening under my nose. I am glad  that\r\n\r\nthat  has been put right. But I was happy  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat second-hand dealers would be very happy to pay\r\n\r\n$200 to $300 direct to the ROV for this service  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  would be additional  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. I am pleased to tell the Member that I am\r\n\r\nvery  happy to accept his proposal, and I will  see\r\n\r\nto it that our officials will provide this service,\r\n\r\nand it may not cost as much as $200 or $300 each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Instead of going through the\r\n\r\nother channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Certainly, I would like to make\r\n\r\nit  quite  clear  that  we will  not  tolerate  any\r\n\r\nnonsense,  even in motor firms; if they think  they\r\n\r\ncan  get some illegal money just because we  insist\r\n\r\non certain things to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the Member for Sembawang's\r\n\r\nrequest  not  to  be too stringent over  mechanical\r\n\r\ninspections, especially if there is a  wee  bit  of\r\n\r\nsmoke,  it is very difficult to be lenient  because\r\n\r\nthe Member for Potong Pasir has asked, \"What is the\r\n\r\nMinister  doing  about smoky exhausts?\"  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink I can please the Member for Sembawang.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid the standard of mechanical inspections  will\r\n\r\nhave to be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not say that it would be strict nor would I\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  should be too lenient, but  we  have\r\n\r\ncertain standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the Member for Sembawang himself\r\n\r\nhas admitted that in the past very little was being\r\n\r\ndone  about inspections. It is because very  little\r\n\r\nwas being done in the past that, when you begin  to\r\n\r\nreorganise and decide to maintain certain standards\r\n\r\nof performance, people begin to grumble, \"Oh, it is\r\n\r\ntoo  strict.\"  So I will say that, as  he  is  well\r\n\r\naware,  taxis are subject to bi-annual inspections;\r\n\r\nthere will be an inspection every six months.  Even\r\n\r\na  new vehicle has got to be looked into. And if it\r\n\r\nso  happens  that a new taxi emits too much  smoke,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that engine is not properly  tuned.  It\r\n\r\nhas  got  to  be  put right, and  therefore  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  certain  standards  of  mechanical\r\n\r\ninspection   to  be  maintained.   I   am   afraid,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  we  cannot  reduce  the   present\r\n\r\nstandard  of  inspections. That  would  defeat  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation programme which is to achieve higher\r\n\r\nstandards  in our public service vehicles.  If  the\r\n\r\ntaxis have been reasonably maintained and serviced,\r\n\r\nthey  should have no difficulty in getting  through\r\n\r\nthe mechanical inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a general misconception that\r\n\r\nmechanical  inspections are strict.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nstrict.  They  are  just minimal,  because  certain\r\n\r\nminimal   standards   must   be   maintained.   The\r\n\r\nmisconception arises from the fact that nine  years\r\n\r\nprior  to June 1971 - that goes back to 1962 -  the\r\n\r\nROV   Mechanical   Inspection  Section   had   been\r\n\r\nunderstaffed  because of the inability  to  recruit\r\n\r\nqualified  personnel. Inspections,  therefore,  had\r\n\r\nbeen  cursory. But since 1971 more qualified  staff\r\n\r\nhave been recruited, and all of them are now in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSin  Ming Road centre where there are adequate pits\r\n\r\nfor   the   examination  of  vehicles.   Mechanical\r\n\r\ninspections, therefore, have been brought up to the\r\n\r\nstandard  as  they  ought  to  be.  This  has  been\r\n\r\nmisinterpreted as stricter inspections. So  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member for Sembawang that we  are  not\r\n\r\nbeing  too strict. We are just maintaining  certain\r\n\r\nminimal standards of maintenance of vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for his detailed reply,  and  I  beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,356,390 for Head 0706 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,343,000 for Head 0706 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a resolution of the House, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker  thereupon left the Chair of the  Committee\r\n\r\nand took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto  report  that the Committee of Supply  has  made\r\n\r\nprogress  on the Main and Development Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure for the financial year 1st April,  1973\r\n\r\nto  31st  March, 1974, and ask leave to  sit  again\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"- [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-three</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">minutes to to Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
