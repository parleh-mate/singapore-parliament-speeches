Where the value\r\n\r\nof  the property is up to $30,000, there will  be  no\r\n\r\nchange  in the existing rate and, as such, purchasers\r\n\r\nof  Housing and Development Board flats or other low-cost  houses will not have to pay higher stamp  fees.\r\n\r\nWhere  the  value of the property is above  $30,000,\r\n\r\nand not more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  $50,000, there will be an increase of 50  cents\r\n\r\nfor  every $100 or part thereof on the value  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty  exceeding $30,000. In respect  of  property\r\n\r\nexceeding  $50,000, there will be an increase  of  $1\r\n\r\nfor  every  $100  or part thereof  on  the  value  of\r\n\r\nproperty  exceeding $50,000. It is  quite  reasonable\r\n\r\nthat purchasers of property of higher value pay more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the rate of duty on the transfer of\r\n\r\nshares and stocks is 15 cents for every $100 or  part\r\n\r\nthereof  where the name of the transferee  is  filled\r\n\r\nprior  to  the  execution of the transfer, in  other\r\n\r\ncases,  the rate is 20 cents for every $100  or  part\r\n\r\nthereof. It is proposed to increase the stamp duty to\r\n\r\n20 cents and 30 cents respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present fee of 10 cents per share certificate\r\n\r\nwill  be  increased to $1 for every  $1,000  or  part\r\n\r\nthereof  of  the par value in respect  of  new  share\r\n\r\ncertificates.  This revised rate will also  apply  to\r\n\r\ncertificates  issued in respect of bonus  and  rights\r\n\r\nissues.  The  higher  fee is  justified  because,  in\r\n\r\nsubsequent  transactions, very  often  shares  change\r\n\r\nhands  without registration, resulting in a  loss  of\r\n\r\nrevenue. At the same time, the existing flat rate  of\r\n\r\n50 cents on a contract note will be replaced by an ad\r\n\r\nvalorem duty. A duty of $1  for every $1,000  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue of the shares and stocks will be payable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stamp duty on cheques will be raised from 10\r\n\r\ncents  to 15 cents and on receipts from six cents  to\r\n\r\n10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, there are small increases in the\r\n\r\nrate of stamp duties on mortgages, leases, insurance,\r\n\r\nappraisements, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, no increase in the duties on 15\r\n\r\nitems. These consist of the following five items  for\r\n\r\nwhich  there has been no increase in the rates  since\r\n\r\n1935.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) bonds on superannuation annuity - the rate is\r\n\r\n25 cents for every $100;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) bonds of any other kind whatsoever - the rate\r\n\r\nis $5;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) apprenticeship deed - the rate is $1;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) policy of sea insurance, where the premium\r\n\r\ndoes not exceed $1 - the rate is five cents; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) life insurance policy for every $1,000 insured\r\n\r\n- the rate is 10 cents per $1,000 or part\r\n\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two items affect people in the lower\r\n\r\nincome group and item (iii) affects students who wish\r\n\r\nto  learn  a  trade. In the case of item (iv) ,  if  a\r\n\r\nhigher  duty  is charged, it may divert  business  to\r\n\r\nother  countries as the policy of sea insurance  could\r\n\r\nbe  taken  elsewhere. In the case of  life  insurance\r\n\r\npolicy, the rate is not increased because there is an\r\n\r\nautomatic  increase  in  the  amount  of  stamp  duty\r\n\r\npayable with the larger value of life policies  being\r\n\r\ntaken now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten items for which the rates have not been\r\n\r\nincreased since 1952 are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) affidavits and statutory declarations - $2;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) bonds on letters of administration where the\r\n\r\nestate does not exceed $10,000 - $2;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) power or letter of attorney for appointing a\r\n\r\nproxy or where the value of a property is\r\n\r\nbelow $1,000 - $1;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) any instrument certified or endorsed by a\r\n\r\npublic notary - $2;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) reconveyancing of mortgaged properties and\r\n\r\nsecurities:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where the amount of monies secured does\r\n\r\nnot exceed $1,000 - $1;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where the amount of monies secured is\r\n\r\nbetween $1,000 and $10,000 - $3; \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any other case, the rate is $10;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) declaration of any trust or instrument\r\n\r\nchargeable with duty on a settlement - $10; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) appointment of a trustee - $10;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) duplicate of any instrument chargeable with\r\n\r\nduty - $2;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) protest of bill or note made by a public notary\r\n\r\nattesting  the dishonour of a bill of  exchange\r\n\r\nor promissory note - $1; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) revocation of any trust of any property other\r\n\r\nthan a will - $10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific rates of duties affect generally people\r\n\r\nin  the  lower income group. Affidavits and statutory\r\n\r\ndeclarations are required by people for  purposes  of\r\n\r\nidentity  cards, birth certificates and for admission\r\n\r\nof  children to schools, etc. In the case of bonds on\r\n\r\nletters of administration, the specific duty is  only\r\n\r\napplicable  for  release  of  estates  of  less  than\r\n\r\n$10,000. This will affect families with small  means.\r\n\r\nPower  or  letter of attorney appointing a  proxy  to\r\n\r\nvote at a meeting is a very small item of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the other items, the present rates\r\n\r\nare reasonable, considering that the parties affected\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  pay duties on the other  instruments\r\n\r\nconnected with the transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that where the items affect people\r\n\r\nin  the  lower income group, the duties  will  remain\r\n\r\nunaltered and, at such, the revision of stamp  duties\r\n\r\nwill  only  affect  people who can afford  the  small\r\n\r\nincreases in the rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 36 (1)\r\n\r\nof the Stamp Ordinance by increasing the flat fee for\r\n\r\nadjudication  from  $1 to $25 to cover  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nservices performed by the Commissioner of Stamps.  In\r\n\r\naddition, it is proposed to introduce a fee where the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  property has to be  certified  by  .1\r\n\r\nGovernment  valuer. This fee will  be  based  on  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  amount  declared   by   the\r\n\r\napplicant  and the amount certified by the Government\r\n\r\nvaluer as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a fee of one per cent will be charged on the\r\n\r\nfirst difference of $10,000;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a fee of half per cent will be charged on the\r\n\r\nnext difference of $90,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the difference is in excess of $100,000, the\r\n\r\nrate  of  duty  will be one-quarter  per  cent.

These tax measures have  been\r\n\r\ndescribed  as mild and fair because the new  taxation\r\n\r\nhas  been  kept  to  the minimum and  the  additional\r\n\r\nburden  is  spread  thinly over  a  large  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  able  to pay  without  being  over\r\n\r\nburdened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed fears that the levy on\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board bills will cause hardship  to\r\n\r\nthe  poor  households. In fact, the levy is based  on\r\n\r\nthe ability to pay and the burden on the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup  is minimal. This has been achieved by avoiding\r\n\r\nany  additional tax on cheaper cooking fuels  and  by\r\n\r\nexempting households whose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.U.B. bills do not exceed $10 a month.\r\n\r\nThere is a rough relationship between\r\n\r\nthe amount of the P.U.B. bill and the\r\n\r\neconomic status of the household. The\r\n\r\nvery poor are not on the P.U.B. billing\r\n\r\nlist or have bills between $1 and $5.\r\n\r\nSuch households use only little electricity\r\n\r\nfor lighting and consume little water.\r\n\r\nThe next group with P.U.B. bills\r\n\r\nbetween $6 and $10 consumes more electricity\r\n\r\nand water. There are some\r\n\r\n58,000 households, or roughly 25 per\r\n\r\ncent, whose monthly P.U.B. bills are\r\n\r\nless than $10. These people do not have\r\n\r\nto pay tax on their bills. As the income\r\n\r\nrises, households purchase refrigerators,\r\n\r\nradios, television sets and install fans,\r\n\r\nwater-heaters and air-conditioners. The \r\n\r\naverage monthly cost of power for each\r\n\r\nof these appliances is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                       Average\r\n\r\n          Article                   cost of power\r\n\r\n                                      per month\r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n          Fan                         $3 to  $4\r\n\r\n          Refrigerator                $3 to  $4\r\n\r\n          Television                  $3 to  $4\r\n\r\n          Water-heater                $5 to  $6\r\n\r\n          Air-conditioner\r\n\r\n            (one horse-power unit)   $27 to $30\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible to isolate the really\r\n\r\npoor  households y the type of cooking\r\n\r\nfuel used, suhc as kerosene, charcoal\r\n\r\nand wood. Sir, may I rfer to teh \r\n\r\nSingapore Sample Household Survey,\r\n\r\n1966, which was conducted by the \r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development and\r\n\r\nthe Economic Research Centre,\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore? It is entitled\r\n\r\nSingapore Sample Household Survey, 1966, No 1,\r\n\r\nand printed by the Government Printer in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1967. The table I refer to,\r\n\r\nSir, is H.54 at page 234 of the Report.\r\n\r\nAccording to this survey, of the total 331,952\r\n\r\nhouseholds; kerosene was used by 104,399 households; charcoal was used by 32,675 households; and wood was used by 58,231 households;\r\n\r\ncollectively accounting for 59 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe households. There are about 73,000\r\n\r\nP.U.B. consumers whose monthly bills \r\n\r\nrange from $10 to $20. They will be\r\n\r\nliable to pay a levy of five per cent.\r\n\r\nNearly half of these households will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave to pay between 50 cents and 70\r\n\r\ncents per month and the other half will\r\n\r\nhave to pay between 75 cents and $1\r\n\r\nmore per month. The small levy will not\r\n\r\ncause any hardship as these households\r\n\r\nare in the better financial position, or\r\n\r\notherwise they would not be in a\r\n\r\nposition to have fans, radios and\r\n\r\nrefrigerators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next category of households,\r\n\r\nnumbering 32,000, have P.U.B. bills of\r\n\r\nbetween $21 and $30. They will be required\r\n\r\nto pay a levy of 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese households will have to pay\r\n\r\nbetween $2 an $3 a month. Such households will normally have fans, television sets and refrigerators and the extra $2 to $3 a month is not likely to\r\n\r\ninvolve any sacrifice on their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 50,000 households\r\n\r\nwith P.U.B. bills above $30. These\r\n\r\nhouseholds are the more affluent and\r\n\r\nthey have refrigerators, television sets, \r\n\r\nwater-heaters and even air-conditioners.\r\n\r\nThese households also have two or three\r\n\r\nwater closets. I am sure that these\r\n\r\npeople can afford to pay a levy varying\r\n\r\nfrom $3 to $12 per month. Members\r\n\r\nwill agree that the tax which rises from\r\n\r\na few cents to a few dollars in line with\r\n\r\nthe economic status of the households\r\n\r\nis not unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy on Singapore Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard - for short, I shall just say\r\n\r\nS.T.B. - bills will only affect people\r\n\r\nwith means, as the less well-to-do are\r\n\r\nunlikely to have a telephone. There are\r\n\r\n45,104 residential lines and 35,552\r\n\r\nbusiness lines for our population of two\r\n\r\nmillion people. This is the first time for\r\n\r\nmore than a decade that telephone subscribers\r\n\r\nwill have to pay an additional\r\n\r\namount, as the telephone charges have \r\n\r\nnot been revised since 1958. Resisdential\r\n\r\nsubscribers who do not make trunk calls\r\n\r\nfrequently will, on the average, pay about\r\n\r\n$3.50 per line per month. I am sure the \r\n\r\namount of tax is far from being\r\n\r\nexorbitant and can be borne easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although new administrative machinery\r\n\r\nis not requried for the collection\r\n\r\nof taxes on P.U.B. and S.T.B. bills, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide by enactment of this Bill, legal\r\n\r\nauthority for the imposition and collection of  these\r\n\r\ntaxes.

As at 31st October, 1968, the total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  seamen on the register was 8,264,  and  a\r\n\r\nreserve  pool at 20 per cent would be 1,653, but  the\r\n\r\nactual availability was only 1,258 or 15 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  number of registered seamen in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   demand  has  arisen,  firstly  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncessation   of   confrontation  by   Indonesia   with\r\n\r\nconsequent  new job opportunities, and the preference\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  seamen  in relation  to  other  Asian\r\n\r\nseamen,  and,  secondly, because of our  Government's\r\n\r\npromotional  activities for more  jobs  at  sea.  Our\r\n\r\ntraining ship \"Singapore\", which was started in 1964,\r\n\r\nhas  so  far  creditably produced over 1,600  trained\r\n\r\nseamen.

Prior to the formation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Singapore was a Port of British  Registry.\r\n\r\nWith  Malaysia, Singapore became a Port of  Malaysian\r\n\r\nRegistry.  Soon  after  the separation  in  1965,  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to establish our own Registry of Ships,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act  of  1966  was\r\n\r\naccordingly   promulgated.  Under   this   piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation,   ownership  of  Singapore   ships   was\r\n\r\nconfined   to   Singapore  citizens   and   companies\r\n\r\nincorporated in Singapore and having their  principal\r\n\r\nplace  of  business  in Singapore. Indeed,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens and companies were compelled under  the  law\r\n\r\nto register their ships as Singapore ships. While, on\r\n\r\nthe   one  hand,  an  obligation  was  imposed   upon\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and companies to  register  their\r\n\r\nships  with  us, on the other hand, no  corresponding\r\n\r\nincentives  were  offered.  It  was  not  surprising,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to  find  that  after  one  year  of  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of our Registry, as at  31st  October,\r\n\r\n1967,  there  were  only 298 ships  on  the  Register\r\n\r\ntotalling some 123,000 gross tons. Of the 298  ships,\r\n\r\n244  or  82 per cent were tugs, barges, dumb lighters\r\n\r\nand other small harbour craft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, a review was made and we decided that\r\n\r\nwe  should  remove the restriction  on  ownership  of\r\n\r\nSingapore ships and offer attractive incentives so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, by making it worth while, ship-owners would  be\r\n\r\ninduced  to  fly  the  Singapore  flag.  Members  may\r\n\r\nrecollect  that the then Deputy Prime  Minister,  now\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Science and Technology,  stated  in\r\n\r\nParliament during the course of the Budget debate  in\r\n\r\nDecember   last  year  that  legislation   would   be\r\n\r\nintroduced this year to encourage more ships  to  fly\r\n\r\nthe Singapore flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to amend the\r\n\r\nMerchant Shipping Ordinance to enable Singapore to be\r\n\r\na  party  to  the  International Convention  for  the\r\n\r\nSafety of Life at Sea, 1960, and to establish an open\r\n\r\nRegistry of Ships. At present, Singapore is  a  party\r\n\r\nto   the  1948  Safety  Convention.  This  Convention\r\n\r\nprescribes  certain  requirements  relating  to   the\r\n\r\nconstruction and survey of ships, provision of  life-saving  appliances  and radio  equipment,  safety  of\r\n\r\nnavigation, carriage of grain and of dangerous goods.\r\n\r\nSignatory  governments  are obliged  to  apply  these\r\n\r\nprescribed  standards  to  their  ships.   The   1960\r\n\r\nConvention  is  in  scope and content  essentially  a\r\n\r\nrevision  and extension of the 1948 Convention  which\r\n\r\nit  replaces. Being a major port and having  a  vital\r\n\r\ninterest in the development of merchant shipping,  it\r\n\r\nis   necessary  for  Singapore  to  accept  the  1960\r\n\r\nConvention.  The first part of this Bill,  therefore,\r\n\r\ncontains  provisions  whkh will enable  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ngive effect to the provisions of the 1960 Convention.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by deleting Part III of the existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance which deals with passenger ships  only  and\r\n\r\nwhith  contains outdated provisions, and substituting\r\n\r\ntherefor  a  new Part III. Under this new  Part  III,\r\n\r\nships   are   required  to  hold  Safety   Convention\r\n\r\ncertificates, and provision is made for the issue  of\r\n\r\nthe appropriate certificates for both passenger ships\r\n\r\nas  well  as  cargo  ships. Power  is  given  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   to  make  the  necessary  regulations   to\r\n\r\nimplement the provisions of the 1960 Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this Bill seeks to amend the existing\r\n\r\nOrdinance to  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide for an open Registry of Ships in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is  achieved by deleting the existing Part  XIV\r\n\r\nand  substituting  a new Part XIV. The  ownership  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   ships  is  not  restricted  to  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  or  companies  incorporated  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nUnder   section   504,   any   person   or   company,\r\n\r\nirrespective    of   nationality   and    place    of\r\n\r\nincorporation,  is eligible to register  ships  under\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  flag. Where previously ownership  was\r\n\r\nconfined  to  Singapore citizens and companies,  this\r\n\r\nclause   now  provides  an  opportunity  for  foreign\r\n\r\nshipowners  to place their ships under the  Singapore\r\n\r\nRegister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would not be sufficient merely to open\r\n\r\nthe  Register  to foreign shipowners  and  companies.\r\n\r\nIncentives have to be provided for to make  it  worth\r\n\r\nwhile  for shipowners to fly the Singapore flag,  and\r\n\r\nI,  therefore, draw Members' attention to section 512\r\n\r\nwhich provides for very low fees for the registration\r\n\r\nof  ships.  An initial registration fee of $2.50  per\r\n\r\nnet  ton,  and an annual tonnage tax of 20 cents  per\r\n\r\nnet  ton  only  shall be payable for every  Singapore\r\n\r\nship. It is provided that this fee and annual tonnage\r\n\r\ntax  shall not be increased for a period of 20  years\r\n\r\nfrom  the  date of initial registration of the  ship.\r\n\r\nShipowners will note that these rates are very  much\r\n\r\nlower than those charged by other flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this incentive of low fees, we will\r\n\r\nprovide   another   extremely  attractive   financial\r\n\r\nincentive, which is that no Singapore income tax  is\r\n\r\npayable  on profits derived from ships registered  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Financially, therefore, a shipowner  need\r\n\r\nonly  pay  very  low  fees,  the  rate  of  which  is\r\n\r\nguaranteed  for  20 years, and profits  derived  from\r\n\r\nSingapore ships are exempt from Singapore income tax.\r\n\r\nI  should  like  to assure shipowners  that  although\r\n\r\nincome  tax exemption provisions are not specifically\r\n\r\nstated  in this Bill, appropriate amendments  to  our\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  laws  are expected to be  introduced  in\r\n\r\nParliament in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these financial incentives, we will\r\n\r\nalso   be   providing   other   advantages   of   an\r\n\r\nadministrative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand technical nature. Shipowners who wish to transfer\r\n\r\ntheir  ships  to  the  Singapore  flag  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  have  them  re-surveyed  if  the  ships\r\n\r\npossess  valid  certificates. As a matter  of  fact,\r\n\r\nthis policy of not requiring ships to be re-surveyed\r\n\r\nhas  been in force since early last year and will  be\r\n\r\ncontinued. Further, provision is made in section  509\r\n\r\n(4)  to  accept  foreign tonnage  certificates.  This\r\n\r\nmeans   that  a  ship  holding  a  foreign   tonnage\r\n\r\ncertificate need not be re-measured for tonnage  when\r\n\r\ntransferring  to  the  Singapore  flag.  Again,  this\r\n\r\npractice  has already been in force and will continue\r\n\r\nto  be  so. The acceptance of valid certificates  and\r\n\r\nforeign   tonnage  certificates  will   obviate   the\r\n\r\nnecessity to have the ship drydocked and re-measured,\r\n\r\nand consequently will save the shipowner considerable\r\n\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an added facility, international classification\r\n\r\nsocieties will be appointed to survey Singapore ships\r\n\r\nand  issue  certificates on behalf of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment. At present, four classification societies\r\n\r\nhave  been appointed, namely, the American Bureau  of\r\n\r\nShipping,  the  French  Bureau Veritas,  the  British\r\n\r\nLloyds Register of Shipping, and the Norwegian Norske\r\n\r\nVeritas.   Two   other  international  classification\r\n\r\nsocieties  are also being considered for  appointment\r\n\r\nand,   when  appointed,  shipowners  will  have   six\r\n\r\nclassification  societies for the purpose  of  survey\r\n\r\nand  issue  of  certificates. In addition  to  these,\r\n\r\nthere  is,  of  course,  our  own  Government  Survey\r\n\r\nDivision  whose services are available to shipowners.\r\n\r\nSo  altogether there will be seven survey authorities\r\n\r\nfully  empowered to survey Singapore 'ships and issue\r\n\r\ncertificates on behalf of Government and,  with  the\r\n\r\nsix  classification  societies  giving  international\r\n\r\ncoverage,  shipowners  will  be  assured  of  maximum\r\n\r\nsurvey facilities wherever their ships may be.  Power\r\n\r\nto  appoint  classification  societies  is  given  in\r\n\r\nsection 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this, our registration procedures will\r\n\r\nbe  kept  simple  so that the whole  process  can  be\r\n\r\nexpeditiously completed. We will do everything\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible  to facilitate the transfer and registration\r\n\r\nof ships to the Singapore Registry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may want to know what we hope to gain out of\r\n\r\nthis exercise. With income tax exemption and very low\r\n\r\nfees,  we  could  not hope to gain  much  by  way  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  although the acquisition of a large  tonnage\r\n\r\nwould  bring  in  some useful revenue.  We  hope,  by\r\n\r\nencouraging  foreign  shipowners  to  register  their\r\n\r\nships  under  our  flag,  to create  more  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities for our citizens. Under section 527,\r\n\r\nSingapore  ships  engaged in  home  and  local  trade\r\n\r\nvoyages shall be obliged to carry such percentage  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  seamen as may be prescribed from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime. This may seem onerous at first sight, but it is\r\n\r\nreally  not  so, because these home and  local  trade\r\n\r\nships  are  already  carrying  Singapore  seamen.  To\r\n\r\nencourage  more  foreign-going  ships  to   take   on\r\n\r\nSingapore seamen, we would refund 50 per cent of  the\r\n\r\nannual  tonnage tax if the foreign-going ship carries\r\n\r\nat  least  25  per  cent Singapore  seamen.  This  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in section 527 (2). In this way,  owners\r\n\r\nof  foreign-going ships can reduce  costs  simply  by\r\n\r\nengaging Singapore seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to officers, the existing Ordinance\r\n\r\nrequires  Singapore  ships to be manned  by  officers\r\n\r\nholding  Singapore  certificates  of  competency   or\r\n\r\nCommonwealth certificated officers. Since  we  are\r\n\r\nvery  short  of  local  deck  officers,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared   to  grant  liberal  exemptions   so   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  ships  may be manned by  officers  holding\r\n\r\nvalid foreign certificates. As a matter of fact, this\r\n\r\npolicy of granting exemptions was implemented about a\r\n\r\nyear  ago,  and  during the period  January  1967  to\r\n\r\nNovember  1968, 53 exemptions were granted  to  allow\r\n\r\nforeign   certificated  deck  officers  to  sail   on\r\n\r\nSingapore ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides the\r\n\r\nMinister with powers to make such regulations as  are\r\n\r\nnecessary or expedient. There is no need for  me  to\r\n\r\ngo  into the details of the various' regulations that\r\n\r\nwe  will promulgate in the near future, but I should\r\n\r\nlike to deal with an important set of regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelating to the construction, survey and equipment of\r\n\r\nships.  This set of regulations, which will be  known\r\n\r\nas  the  Safety  Convention  Regulations,  will  give\r\n\r\neffect to the International Convention for the Safety\r\n\r\nof  Life  at Sea, which I mentioned earlier. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say that we expect all Singapore  ships  to\r\n\r\ncome up to international standards. We will not allow\r\n\r\nsub-standards in matters of construction, surveys and\r\n\r\nequipment. But, on the other hand, we will not insist\r\n\r\non  excessive  standards. All  that  we  ask  of  the\r\n\r\nshipowner is to maintain his ship in accordance  with\r\n\r\ninternational standards as prescribed under the  1960\r\n\r\nSafety    Convention.   Consequently,   our    Safety\r\n\r\nRegulations  will be derived substantially  from  the\r\n\r\nregulations  annexed  to  the  1960  Convention.  The\r\n\r\nSafety Regulations are already in draft form and  can\r\n\r\nbe expected to come into force in the not too distant\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say that since\r\n\r\nthe  mention  of  new legislation  in  Parliament  in\r\n\r\nDecember  last year, we have had many inquiries  from\r\n\r\nship-owners  all over the world on the new  Registry.\r\n\r\nMembers  may  wish to know that as at 30th  November,\r\n\r\n1968,  there  were 349 ships exceeding 242,000  gross\r\n\r\ntons  on  our Register. Although it is gratifying  to\r\n\r\nnote  that the registered tonnage has almost  doubled\r\n\r\nsince  October  last year, the figure  is  still  not\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with  our status as  a  major  shipping\r\n\r\ncentre. I am confident that with the passing of  this\r\n\r\nBill  and  with  all the incentives enumerated,  more\r\n\r\nshipowners will fly our Singapore flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nknow  that there are many advantages in having  ships\r\n\r\nregistered in Singapore.

Although  it  is a  general  principle  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  law  that children born out of wedlock  may,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  become legitimate  children  of  their\r\n\r\nparents if and when their parents subsequently  marry\r\n\r\nafter  the birth of such children, this has not  been\r\n\r\nthe case in Singapore in regard to all members of our\r\n\r\nseveral communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This anomaly in the law has resulted from the fact\r\n\r\nthat  our society seeks to accord the respect due  to\r\n\r\nsuch personal laws of the various sects and religions\r\n\r\nthat form part of our multi-racial population. And so\r\n\r\nit  is  that those members of our society that belong\r\n\r\nto  the  Muslim  faith  are  governed  by  their  own\r\n\r\npersonal  laws in respect of such matters as  marital\r\n\r\nlaws,  family laws and laws of succession.

That Act\r\n\r\nspecifically provides that members of our society who\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the Muslim faith are obliged to  register\r\n\r\ntheir  marriages at the Shariah Court. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  is so provided in that  Act  that  such\r\n\r\nregistration of marriages must take place, it was not\r\n\r\nprovided  in  regard to children that  were  born  of\r\n\r\nlegal  marriages, should they be born out of wedlock,\r\n\r\nthat they would receive the consequential benefits of\r\n\r\nhaving  their status altered and becoming  legitimate\r\n\r\nchildren  of their parents. In other words, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of legitimatio per subsequens matrimonium\r\n\r\nwas  not  afforded  to  them. This  obvious  omission\r\n\r\nshould,  in fact, have been taken care of in the  Act\r\n\r\nof  1966 itself. It is therefore to provide for  this\r\n\r\nhiatus  in  the law, i.e., legitimation  of  children\r\n\r\nborn  of  such marriages, that the present Legitimacy\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill is being introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the\r\n\r\nexception  of those people of the Muslim faith,  what\r\n\r\nwill  happen to our citizens born out of wedlock  and\r\n\r\nwhose  parents do not subsequently get  married?

There  is\r\n\r\nno  need for the child to have a parent or father who\r\n\r\nis a citizen of Singapore for the purpose of becoming\r\n\r\na citizen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It can never make him legitimate.  If\r\n\r\nhe marries, his children will be legitimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the queries by the Member for Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  and the Member for Serangoon Gardens, I  think\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  answered by the  Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang.

The\r\n\r\namendments provided for this, under clauses 2  and  3\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill, will bring the Ordinance in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  Port of Singapore Authority Ordinance, 1963, the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Ordinance,  1959,  and  the\r\n\r\nTelephone  Board  Ordinance (Cap. 107),  wherein  the\r\n\r\nappointments to the Board thereunder are made by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of the Public Utilities Board's\r\n\r\nfunctions and activities and the tremendous  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  work  which  members of the  Board  have  to\r\n\r\nundertake,  it  has become necessary  to  expand  the\r\n\r\nmembership of the Board. It is, therefore,  proposed,\r\n\r\nunder  clause 2 of the Bill, to increase  the  member\r\n\r\nship of the Board from nine to 12.

From  the\r\n\r\nreports of the Board, the electricity generation  has\r\n\r\ndoubled  from the time the Board took over,  and  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of water and gas has increased  by  more\r\n\r\nthan 50 per cent. However, I do not consider that  by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the membership of the Board  it  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to cope with such expansion. The United Kingdom\r\n\r\nCentral  Electricity Generation Board,  for  example,\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  full-time  members than  the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  has.

Can  the  Minister  give  an\r\n\r\nassurance that at least some technical personnel will\r\n\r\nbe appointed on the Board so that they may be able to\r\n\r\ngive  competent  advice? Sir, I am not  doubting  the\r\n\r\nability of the present members of the Board. But I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  with technical men sitting on the  Board,\r\n\r\nthey will be of great assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have gone through the reports of the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board since its inception in 1963,  and  1\r\n\r\nhave  found  that  it has gone to  great  lengths  to\r\n\r\npublicise  the  activities and  achievements  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  If  I am not mistaken, sometime  in  1964  or\r\n\r\n1965,  the  Board appointed some American consultants\r\n\r\nto  look into the administration and organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board.  But  since 1963, and up  to  the  latest\r\n\r\nreport  which we have, that is 1966, no  mention  has\r\n\r\nbeen made about this whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It was only when I rang up that the\r\n\r\nwhole  matter  was  solved in two days  and  the  gas\r\n\r\nsupply was turned on.

I think  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a standing committee to look into  the\r\n\r\norganisation  and daily functions  of  the  Board  is\r\n\r\nurgent.

But new members of the Board will  be\r\n\r\nappointed soon and I assure the Member that at  least\r\n\r\none  will  be  an  engineer  who  will  be  of  great\r\n\r\nassistance in the Board.

In\r\n\r\norder  to justify this clause, I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nhow  much  Government proposes to save by validating\r\n\r\nits action in recording these materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I may deal with the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  first.  If  anyone  tapes  from  Radio   and\r\n\r\nTelevision Singapura and uses it outside, it will  be\r\n\r\npiracy.  If the Member for Telok Blangah has  a  tape\r\n\r\nrecorder  at  home,  tapes  and  records  from   T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapura and uses it in public, he will be liable to\r\n\r\nthe penalties provided for under this Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat wants to know whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  similar  legislation to that  provided  in\r\n\r\nclause 6 elsewhere. The answer is - if there is, I am\r\n\r\nnot aware of such legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang talks of expropriation\r\n\r\nand  he wants to know what is the amount involved.  I\r\n\r\nam afraid I cannot give him the details. I am not the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture. Unfortunately, he is not  here.\r\n\r\nBut  I am sure he will be happy to provide the Member\r\n\r\nwith  figures. But I would like to assure the  Member\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  no  intention  of  making  this  Bill\r\n\r\nretrospective.  What  is  past  is  past.  This  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 6 stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, I crave your\r\n\r\nindulgence  in taking this opportunity to answer  the\r\n\r\nquery  raised  by the Member for Bukit  Panjang.  The\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Department has been paying royalty  fees\r\n\r\nto  some  international bodies.  In  fact,  they  are\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  based  organisations.  One  is   the\r\n\r\nPerforming Rights Society, London. We pay the Society\r\n\r\na fixed sum of about $25,000 a year. The other is the\r\n\r\nInternational Federation of Phonographic Industry, to\r\n\r\nwhich  a  sum  of  $15,000 is paid. In  the  past,  a\r\n\r\ndirective came from the then Governor that  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  to pay royalties, and we did pay. There was  no\r\n\r\nreason  given why we should pay. But in the  colonial\r\n\r\ndays the directive came from the Governor, and it was\r\n\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Performing Rights Society, London, claims to\r\n\r\nrepresent  international  authors  and  composers  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of royalties to be paid. This body  and  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Federation  of  Phonographic  Industry\r\n\r\nhave  claimed in recent years an increase in the  sum\r\n\r\npayable  to them on the grounds that we have extended\r\n\r\nthe  hours  of radio broadcasts and that recently  we\r\n\r\nhave  introduced television. We have considered  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Let  me  put it this way.  Broadcasting  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is a Government institution. The motivation\r\n\r\nis, therefore, not profit. Whatever entertainment and\r\n\r\ninformation we provide through this medium is a  kind\r\n\r\nof  education  for  our people. It  is  unlike  other\r\n\r\ncommercial stations in the world, if it were, I would\r\n\r\nhave  supported  the  payment of royalties.  Although\r\n\r\nRadio   and   Television   Singapura   is   partially\r\n\r\ncommercialised, as I said earlier, the  entertainment\r\n\r\nand other programmes provided through this medium are\r\n\r\nnot  profit  motivated. As such, we feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nimperative   that  we  should  keep   the   cost   of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  as low as possible for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> May I have your indulgence, Sir? Members\r\n\r\nmay be interested to know, whilst we are on clause 6,\r\n\r\nthat though Singapore has attended many international\r\n\r\nconferences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  protection of copyrights, designs and patents, we\r\n\r\nare  not  a signatory to any international convention\r\n\r\non  copyrights. We have not signed because it is  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  that  have  the  know-how   and\r\n\r\nknowledge  of these matters. They have  in  the  past\r\n\r\nrefused  or  have  been  rather  reluctant  to   help\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries increase their knowledge of this\r\n\r\nsubject.   This   Act  provides  for  protection   of\r\n\r\ncopyrights   and,  in  fact,  it   is   welcomed   by\r\n\r\ninternational  bodies  like  the  Performing   Rights\r\n\r\nSociety  of  London, it provides  them  considerable\r\n\r\nprotection   from   piracy.  The  amounts   paid   by\r\n\r\nGovernment,   as   mentioned  by  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture, are small when\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  extent of protection  afforded  to\r\n\r\ncopyright  owners.  I think I had better  state  here\r\n\r\nopenly  that  we  have received representations  from\r\n\r\nthese societies. They welcome the Bill, but they have\r\n\r\nasked us to reconsider the provisions of clause 6. We\r\n\r\nhave considered their representations and decided  to\r\n\r\nproceed with clause 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> May I crave your indulgence, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir? The consequence of what  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now  is  that  we  should  not  sign  the\r\n\r\nInternational Convention on Copyrights  and  Patents.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do, then, of course, we might have  to  amend\r\n\r\nclause 6, which might otherwise become illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have\r\n\r\nclause 6, I am afraid one day the result will be such\r\n\r\nthat  even the poorest type of films or musical shows\r\n\r\nof any kind will not be obtainable for Radio and T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I am not quite clear about\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Joo Chiat has said. Perhaps  he\r\n\r\nmight care to repeat it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am thinking in terms of\r\n\r\nmusical films of any kind for T.V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> That is quite simple, Sir. When\r\n\r\nwe hire the films, we pay for the hiring of the films\r\n\r\nand we are not liable. It is the film distributors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  will be liable. I am sure they have already made\r\n\r\narrangements with the international body concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Panjang that we are not a member of  inter\r\n\r\nnational  conventions  and we have  no  intention  of\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  signatory  to  these  conventions.   The\r\n\r\nreason,  I repeat, is that these conventions are  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the developed countries who refuse  to\r\n\r\nshare  their knowledge with us. It is for this reason\r\n\r\nthat  a Bill of this nature was not passed before.  I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned that three industries have been set up\r\n\r\nin Jurong producing musical records and it is for the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  these industries that  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat is a little worried about\r\n\r\nnot  getting  films.
