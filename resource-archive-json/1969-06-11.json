Originally the intention was  to  issue\r\n\r\ncommemorative coins which will not have legal tender\r\n\r\nstatus.  Legal tender issues in gold have  generally\r\n\r\nbeen frowned upon by monetary authorities in view of\r\n\r\nthe   limited  supply  of  monetary  gold  reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the introduction of the two-tier  gold\r\n\r\nmarket  in March last year, this objection no longer\r\n\r\napplies  and  legal gold tender issues are  becoming\r\n\r\nmore frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, therefore, also decided that the present\r\n\r\ngold coin issue to commemorate the 150th Anniversary\r\n\r\nwill  also be a legal tender issue. Accordingly, it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to amend the Currency Act, 1967, which\r\n\r\nonly allows the Currency Board to issue legal tender\r\n\r\ncoins   of  denominations  of  $I  and  below.   The\r\n\r\namendments proposed to sections 14 and 19 of the Act\r\n\r\ntherefore  authorise  the Currency  Board  to  issue\r\n\r\nlegal tender coins of any denominations and to  make\r\n\r\nsuch  coins  legal  tender for the  payment  of  any\r\n\r\namount. This means that these gold coins can be used\r\n\r\nto  pay  for goods and services and can be exchanged\r\n\r\nat  the  Currency Board or the banks  for  notes  or\r\n\r\ncoins of other denominations up to their face value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins to be issued this August will be\r\n\r\nminted  by  the  Chartered industries  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nLimited.

The pension is for life and  is  payable\r\n\r\nafter  reaching  the age of 50 years  and  on  their\r\n\r\nceasing to be Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only circumstance in which a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament can receive a pension while he  is  still\r\n\r\nin Parliament is when he has become what is known as\r\n\r\na  \"backbencher\". \"Backbencher\" is defined by clause\r\n\r\n4,  sub-clause (1) of the Bill to mean a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament   who  does  not  hold  any   office   in\r\n\r\nParliament and who has previously served as a  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  or  Cabinet Minister for a period  of  not\r\n\r\nless  than  three  years, and who has  completed  10\r\n\r\nyears'  reckonable service and has attained the  age\r\n\r\nof 50 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of pension to be paid is to be\r\n\r\ncalculated  at  the  rate  of  one-thirtieth  of   a\r\n\r\nMember's annual salary for every completed  year  of\r\n\r\nreckonable service, and, in respect of any remaining\r\n\r\nuncompleted year of reckonable service, at the  rate\r\n\r\nof  one-three  hundred and sixtieth  of  a  Member's\r\n\r\nannual  salary for each completed month  of  reckonable  service.  The maximum amount payable  is  two-thirds of his annual salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further provisions of the Bill are explained at\r\n\r\nlength in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, and\r\n\r\nI do not think it necessary to elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this Bill, the practices adopted by\r\n\r\nother   Commonwealth  countries  were   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration. In Britain, for instance, a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament  can qualify for a pension  on  attaining\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  65  years, provided he has  10  years'\r\n\r\nreckonable service, at the rate of \ufffd60 or about $450\r\n\r\nfor  each year of service for the first 15 years and\r\n\r\nthereafter at the rate of \ufffd24 or about $180 for each\r\n\r\nadditional year, subject to a maximum of 45 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, a Member of Parliament can qualify\r\n\r\nfor  a pension at the age of 40 years. Here, pension\r\n\r\nis received at the rate of 30 per cent of the Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament's allowance at the age of 40,  rising\r\n\r\nby  four  per  cent each year until  he  reaches  44\r\n\r\nyears.  From the age of 45 years on, the  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament gets a pension at the rate of 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof his allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand Members of Parliament are entitled to\r\n\r\npensions  after  nine  years  of  service   and   on\r\n\r\nattaining  the  age of 50 years. The  rate  is  one-thirty-second  of  the Member of  Parliament's  last\r\n\r\ndrawn salary, subject to a maximum of two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nhis last drawn salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, a pension is paid to a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament  who serves more than two  terms  with  a\r\n\r\nmaximum rate of Canadian $9,000 or S$27,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my opinion that our Ministers are grossly\r\n\r\nunderpaid. I, as Finance Minister, for example, earn\r\n\r\nless than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  branch manager of a bank and less than a  quarter\r\n\r\nof  what  a managing director of a reputable company\r\n\r\nwould  earn. Our Prime Minister is earning something\r\n\r\nlike  10  per cent of what he could earn in  private\r\n\r\npractice  as  a lawyer. Other of my colleagues  also\r\n\r\nundergo financial sacrifice to some degree or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the old guard and we will soldier on. But\r\n\r\nwhat  worries  us  is  the question  of  the  second\r\n\r\nechelon  leadership who must in time take  over  the\r\n\r\ntorch  from  us.  We  cannot expect  to  get  future\r\n\r\nleaders  of calibre on the cheap, whatever  was  the\r\n\r\ncase  in the past, and it is as well that the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  realize and accept this fact.  Unless\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  want to settle in  the  future  for  a\r\n\r\nmediocre crack-pot or corrupt leadership, they  must\r\n\r\nnot  believe  they  can continue to  expect  men  of\r\n\r\nability   in  future  to  suffer  severe   financial\r\n\r\nsacrifices  in  pursuit  of  a  hazardous  political\r\n\r\ncareer.  In  my  opinion, a  mediocre  crack-pot  or\r\n\r\ncorrupt  political leadership will ruin this country\r\n\r\nin  an  incredibly  short time, and  such  ruination\r\n\r\ncould be final, complete and permanent, as Singapore\r\n\r\nhas no natural resources or a large economic base on\r\n\r\nwhich to effect a recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the passing of this Bill into law will not\r\n\r\nguarantee  the attraction of leaders of calibre,  it\r\n\r\nis  at least a first step in this direction. And  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  continued  prosperity  and  success  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the cost of the pension is a small  price\r\n\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. Question\r\n\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Government  on  introducing  this\r\n\r\ntimely  Parliamentary Pensions Bill for the  Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament who will have to retire in the course\r\n\r\nof  time.  The Government is concerned  about  their\r\n\r\nfuture,  as the Minister for Finance has  said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister and other Ministers have  been\r\n\r\nunderpaid. But if you look at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill, it provides  a  pension  of\r\n\r\nonly  one-thirtieth  of the  annual  salary  of  the\r\n\r\nretired  Member of Parliament. I would have  thought\r\n\r\nthat  something like 50 per cent would be justified,\r\n\r\nbut not one-thirtieth of the annual salary, which is\r\n\r\na paltry sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think you will agree with me that in our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, a Member of Parliament has a\r\n\r\nlot  of opportunities to make money. But in the case\r\n\r\nof  the  M.P.s in Singapore, especially  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nM.P.s, there is nothing for them and they cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything  at all. That is the reason why I say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should give more  consideration  to\r\n\r\nincrease the quantum of pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is: why must the Government choose\r\n\r\nthe  magic figure of ten years' service in order for\r\n\r\nan M.P. to be able to qualify for a pension? Why not\r\n\r\nbring  it down to eight or nine years? Although  one\r\n\r\nparliamentary term is five years, I feel  we  should\r\n\r\nbe  more  realistic. If we accept this Bill  without\r\n\r\namendment,  it means that an M.P. has  to  be  three\r\n\r\ntimes lucky before he can qualify for a pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But my main concern  is\r\n\r\nwith the ten years' reckonable service. I would like\r\n\r\nto  inform  the House that as at present,  even  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance does not qualify for a pension.\r\n\r\nOnly  the  Prime  Minister does.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  will  qualify only next July. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest to him to amend \"ten years\" to\r\n\r\n\"nine   years\"  because  most  of  the  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament are young and there is no doubt that they\r\n\r\ncan  continue in Parliamentary service. I think nine\r\n\r\nyears'  reckonable service is more  appropriate.

However, I  am\r\n\r\ninclined  to  agree with the Member for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nthat  the proposed pension for Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nwould appear to be rather inadequate, because by the\r\n\r\ntime  a Member of Parliament reaches the age  of  50\r\n\r\n-and  I can see from a look at Members in this House\r\n\r\nthat some of them will not take a long time to reach\r\n\r\nthe  age  of 50 - I am doubtful how much his pension\r\n\r\nwill  be worth. If a Member of Parliament can  serve\r\n\r\nten  years,  he will get only about $200.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Anson that if the figure of  ten\r\n\r\nyears' service is put down, it is very doubtful if a\r\n\r\nthird of the Members of this House will qualify  for\r\n\r\nsuch a pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Bras Basah either\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the Bill or I have misunderstood  him.\r\n\r\nHe says it is one-thirtieth of his pension. Actually\r\n\r\nit  is  one-thirtieth per year, so that if you serve\r\n\r\nten years, then you get one-third of $500, which  is\r\n\r\nabout $180.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is less than $180!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is $180 to the nearest $10. If you go on for 20\r\n\r\nyears, then you get about $360. I think the rate  of\r\n\r\none-thirtieth,  which is about 3 1/3  per  cent,  is\r\n\r\nfairly generous by way of pension rights. The  civil\r\n\r\nservice gets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  half that rate. But then, of course, they have\r\n\r\nsecurity and a longer tenure of employment,  whereas\r\n\r\na  Member  of  Parliament does not  know  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen beyond five years at the most. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nthought  it  reasonable to give  a  higher  quantum.\r\n\r\nThere  are  Commonwealth countries like New  Zealand\r\n\r\nwhich  pay  four per cent a year. So if the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah, Anson and Joo Chiat think that  the\r\n\r\ntotal quantum is inadequate, I think the remedy lies\r\n\r\nnot  in  increasing the pension rate but perhaps  in\r\n\r\nincreasing the annual allowance of M.P.s. And it  is\r\n\r\nup  to  them  to  settle this  question  with  their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards nine years' or ten years' service, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think my colleagues would mind my revealing  to\r\n\r\nthis   House  that  this  has  been  a  subject   of\r\n\r\ndiscussion and debate in Cabinet lasting for  weeks.\r\n\r\nIn  the end, we settled for ten years.

This is a  very\r\n\r\ngood sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of appointing six additional\r\n\r\nmembers  to  the  Board, I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nappoint people who are economists with a great  deal\r\n\r\nof experience so that they can look into the problem\r\n\r\nof promoting industrialisation more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary has just now mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  quality and standards of local products.  I  am\r\n\r\nglad he has paid attention to this matter. This will\r\n\r\nremind  our  industrialists that they should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  quality of their products is sufficiently\r\n\r\ncompetitive so that their products will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncompete  with foreign goods. In addition, this  will\r\n\r\ngive  a  greater degree of confidence to  our  local\r\n\r\nconsumers. Although our industrialisation  programme\r\n\r\nhas  been going on for about six or seven years,  we\r\n\r\nalready have had fairly good results and we are glad\r\n\r\nabout  this.

The Authority also agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nassets  and  liabilities of the  dockyard  would  be\r\n\r\nhanded  over  to  the new company. Accordingly,  the\r\n\r\ncompany was incorporated on 3rd August, 1968, under\r\n\r\nthe  name  of the Singapore Dry Dock and Engineering\r\n\r\nCo.

We know that the shipbuilding\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore has provided a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities  for  thousands   of   our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  and  has  also earned  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  for Singapore,  amounting  to  at\r\n\r\nleast  $400  million per annum.

In the same way that we have developed\r\n\r\nour  port  facilities - we have advanced to  be  the\r\n\r\nfourth greatest port in the world - so we should try\r\n\r\nto  go a step further in enhancing our reputation in\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  in order to gain the fourth  place  in\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  in the world. We can even  advance  to\r\n\r\nfirst place if we put in further efforts, so that we\r\n\r\nwill  not  only  have a nice port but  also  a  fine\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  industry in our Republic.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nhard-working  labour force, high productivity,  fine\r\n\r\nworkmanship, and also an efficient Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.  All these are favourable conditions  for\r\n\r\nfurther increased development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, we have entered\r\n\r\ninto a new era in shipbuilding with the introduction\r\n\r\nof  containerisation. We have spent a great deal  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  develop our port facilities in  order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  new  requirements of containerisation  so\r\n\r\nthat  we will be able to handle cargoes faster  than\r\n\r\never  before.  We have a three-shift system  in  our\r\n\r\ndockyard  so that cargoes can be handled  all  round\r\n\r\nthe clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the port of Singapore has played a\r\n\r\ngreat  role  in  the development of  our  trade  and\r\n\r\neconomy.

As section 5 now stands, a person who\r\n\r\nhas  been convicted for failing to register  is  not\r\n\r\nlegally  bound to register even though he  has  been\r\n\r\ntried and convicted for the offence. The addition of\r\n\r\nthe  new  subsection will remedy this  situation  by\r\n\r\ngiving authority to the Court to direct persons  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  tried and convicted of this  offence  to\r\n\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Act are to section 16K\r\n\r\n(1).  Clause  5  of the Bill seeks to  increase  the\r\n\r\nnational service liability of persons who have  been\r\n\r\nselected  for  officer training from  two  years  to\r\n\r\nthree  years.  This  is  desirable  because  officer\r\n\r\ntraining is lengthy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpensive. Besides, to be effective, an officer must\r\n\r\nserve  at least 18 months after he has been trained.\r\n\r\nHe  can  then go into the Reserves. The total period\r\n\r\nof  service  has,  therefore,  to  be  three  years.\r\n\r\nAlthough   it  is  possible  to  retain  a  national\r\n\r\nserviceman  in service for three years  or  for  any\r\n\r\nlonger  period  by  virtue of  section  16c  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, this is not the proper section to  invoke\r\n\r\nbecause it was designed for times of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill also amends sections 16K (2)\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance  by enabling  part-time  national\r\n\r\nservicemen to be deployed for duty for either  three\r\n\r\nhours  per  week,  or six hours  per  fortnight,  or\r\n\r\ntwelve  hours per month. The deployment of part-time\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen in the People's Defence  Force,\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary  on\r\n\r\npolice  duties has shown that three hours' duty  per\r\n\r\nweek  is  not practicable. By the time the  national\r\n\r\nserviceman has been briefed and reaches his beat, he\r\n\r\nhas  only  a short actual duty period before  it  is\r\n\r\ntime  for  him to report off. The proposed amendment\r\n\r\nwill  enable national servicemen to be deployed  for\r\n\r\nduty  for continuous periods of up to a total of  12\r\n\r\nhours in a month, thereby making the deployment more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 9 of the Ordinance by\r\n\r\nadding  a  new  subsection (10) to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nmedical examination of a person who is to be  called\r\n\r\nup for national service has to undergo is a full and\r\n\r\nproper   medical  examination,  including  a  dental\r\n\r\nexamination at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor amendment is also being made by including\r\n\r\nthe  expressions  \"vigilante  corps\"  and  \"VIA\"  to\r\n\r\nsection  26  (1)  (b) of the Ordinance,  which  were\r\n\r\ninadvertently left unamended when the Ordinance  was\r\n\r\namended in March 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat what I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before on the subject of national  service.

It takes about 18 months  to\r\n\r\ntwo years to train an officer, and just after he has\r\n\r\ncompleted his training, we are letting him off. This\r\n\r\ndoes not serve the purpose at all.

As a consequence of the\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill, trial by jury in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be abolished altogether. In place of this\r\n\r\nmethod of trial, in every case where an accused\r\n\r\nperson faces a charge, which upon conviction may\r\n\r\nresult in capital punishment being imposed, he will\r\n\r\nbe arraigned and tried before a Bench of three\r\n\r\nJudges of the High Court. And as Members will see in\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Bill, three High Court Judges\r\n\r\nwill arrive at their decision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nas  to  the guilt or otherwise of the accused either\r\n\r\nunanimously  or by majority. The Government  regards\r\n\r\nthis  amendment to the law as necessary, in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  experiences in the past few years in Singapore,\r\n\r\nif  respect for criminal procedure and confidence in\r\n\r\nour  administration of justice is to be  maintained.\r\n\r\nThis then is the main reason for the proposed change\r\n\r\nin  the  law. It is because of the unreliability  of\r\n\r\nthe system of trial by jury - and I am speaking,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, in the particular context of Singapore -as I\r\n\r\nhave  heretofore  said, proved  by  the  results  of\r\n\r\nrecent cases where although ample evidence of  guilt\r\n\r\nof  an  accused person had been adduced  before  the\r\n\r\ncourt, accused persons have been acquitted. Speaking\r\n\r\nfor myself I feel that this very important aspect of\r\n\r\nthe administration of justice should not be left  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  what are after all seven  laymen  but\r\n\r\nrather  should be left solely in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional Judge who would, to say the  least,  be\r\n\r\nable  to  dispense  justice in  a  more  predictable\r\n\r\nmanner. Hon. Members will agree. I am sure,  when  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  cannot be disputed that professionals\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to \"do the job\" better than  ordinary\r\n\r\nlaymen.  I  might add that before this  contemplated\r\n\r\nchange  in  the law was drafted, the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice and several of the Puisne Judges  who\r\n\r\nnormally  take criminal cases, as well as  those  of\r\n\r\nthe  legal profession were sought. The Chief Justice\r\n\r\nand  the  Judges were in agreement with the proposed\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jury system has always had its protagonists\r\n\r\nand  its critics. We have inherited this system,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  admitted, from the English Common Law  and\r\n\r\none  of the main arguments for its retention is that\r\n\r\nit   involves   the   ordinary   layman   with   the\r\n\r\nadministration of justice. Highly theoretical  views\r\n\r\nthat   such  association  and  involvement  by   the\r\n\r\nordinary  layman with the administration of  justice\r\n\r\nas  demonstrating an important facet of the  meaning\r\n\r\nof  democracy  have been oft-times  suggested  along\r\n\r\nwith   several   others  for  its  retention,   e.g.\r\n\r\nquotations  by well-known and celebrated  Judges  in\r\n\r\nEngland. Lord Halsbury is quoted to have said, \"As a\r\n\r\nrule, all juries are in my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopinion more generally right than Judges\", and  Lord\r\n\r\nDu Parqc. \"When questions of fact had to be decided,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no tribunal to equal a jury, directed  by\r\n\r\nthe  cold impartial Judge.\" Another famous quotation\r\n\r\nis  by Mr Justice Humphreys, one of the greatest of\r\n\r\nEnglish  criminal Judges, who said, \"The correctness\r\n\r\nof a jury's verdict has almost come to be an axiom.\"\r\n\r\nBut  for  every such argument one can well  find  an\r\n\r\nequal  argument for abolishment. I am  not  for  one\r\n\r\nmoment  disagreeing with the views of the celebrated\r\n\r\nJudges in England as to their opinions on the  value\r\n\r\nof  the  jury system but I would like merely to  say\r\n\r\nthat  these opinions held by English Judges  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the social conditions of the time reflect\r\n\r\nvalues deeply rooted in tradition and a way of life.\r\n\r\nI  need  hardly  add, Sir, that these  concepts  and\r\n\r\nvalues  are  not altogether relevant  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSocial  and  economic conditions are very  different\r\n\r\nhere. The jury consists of seven not twelve persons.\r\n\r\nBut  even  in England where the system is so  deeply\r\n\r\nrooted  in tradition and way of life, very  forceful\r\n\r\nand  deeply  critical comments have been  passed  by\r\n\r\neminent  Judges as well as laymen advocating reform.\r\n\r\nThe  result is even in England today there have been\r\n\r\namendments to the law relating to juries. Until very\r\n\r\nrecently  all twelve jurymen had to be unanimous  in\r\n\r\ntheir  verdict. Today in England a majority  verdict\r\n\r\nwould be acceptable. In this respect, it can be said\r\n\r\nthat  our system of jury trial had anticipated these\r\n\r\nchanges  in  England  as here in  Singapore  it  has\r\n\r\nalways been the law that the majority verdicts would\r\n\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One need not be a student of legal history to know\r\n\r\nthat  jury trials have through the ages become  less\r\n\r\nand  less  important  a  method  of  trial  even  in\r\n\r\nEngland, whereas two centuries ago trial by jury was\r\n\r\nfashionable not only in criminal but also  in  civil\r\n\r\ncases. Towards the middle of the last century, civil\r\n\r\njuries  had fallen into desuetude. As a consequence,\r\n\r\nof   course,  when  the  English  Common   Law   was\r\n\r\nintroduced to this part of the world this method  of\r\n\r\ntrial in regard to civil matters was never introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have never known of this method of  trial\r\n\r\nin  civil  suits. If we go back further in point  of\r\n\r\ntime,  and examine the origins of the jury, we  will\r\n\r\nno  doubt  find that its original raison d'etre  was\r\n\r\nquite different from its present purpose and use  as\r\n\r\na method of trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to criminal matters, while it is true\r\n\r\nthat  there  are very well-known lawyers,  statesmen\r\n\r\nand eminent Judges in England who have advocated its\r\n\r\nretention,  it would appear most of these  arguments\r\n\r\nfor  its  retention have, as their  premise,  social\r\n\r\nconditions  where arguments of this  kind  might  be\r\n\r\nappropriate. But, unfortunately, such arguments that\r\n\r\nthe  jury  is the bastion of democracy, etc.,  have\r\n\r\nvery little relevance in Singapore today. And it  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  a  light-hearted manner that the Government\r\n\r\nhas sought to bring about this change in the law. In\r\n\r\nfact, it may be regarded as a logical conclusion  to\r\n\r\nthe  amendments introduced some nine  or  ten  years\r\n\r\nago.  We  have, in the recent past, done  away  with\r\n\r\ntrial  by  jury which used to be the only method  of\r\n\r\ntrial  in  all criminal cases triable  in  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  change now envisaged by this  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbecome all the more desirable when one considers the\r\n\r\nchanges  to  the  system introduced  in  1960  where\r\n\r\ninstead of jury trials we had substituted trial by a\r\n\r\nsingle High Court Judge except for capital offences.\r\n\r\nWhere  the  changes  brought  about  have  been   so\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  implemented,  may  it  not  be  asked,\r\n\r\nwhatever the objections to these changes proposed in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, why have they not been extended to cover\r\n\r\nall  criminal  cases irrespective of  the  penalties\r\n\r\ninvolved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the vociferous objections from certain\r\n\r\nquarters, namely from those members of the  Bar  who\r\n\r\npractise almost exclusively in the criminal  courts,\r\n\r\nand  in  order  that it may not be  said  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has without due deliberation  done  away\r\n\r\nwith  a long-standing practice of the administration\r\n\r\nof  the  law  of  crime, we have, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\ndecided to send this Bill to Select Committee  where\r\n\r\nsuch views as may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraised  may be given every consideration  and  where\r\n\r\nthe  amendments to the Bill of which I have  already\r\n\r\ngiven notice will be dealt with.

Considerable thought has been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  this Bill. Our experiences in the  recent\r\n\r\npast cannot be ignored and rather than allow justice\r\n\r\nto   be   thwarted  through  either   ignorance   or\r\n\r\nsqueamishness,   we   must  be   prepared   wherever\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the well-being of the  community  to\r\n\r\namend  the  procedural methods of administering  the\r\n\r\nlaw relating to offences carrying the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, only offences that carry the death\r\n\r\npenalty  are subject to trial by judge and jury  and\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  seeks to amend section 178  (1)  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code by abolishing this  form  of\r\n\r\ntrial  and  substituting it with a  trial  by  three\r\n\r\nJudges  of the High Court. To state this in  another\r\n\r\nway,  henceforth,  a  human  being  charged  with  a\r\n\r\ncapital  offence would be convicted, if at all,  not\r\n\r\nby the simple verdict of a jury, but by the reasoned\r\n\r\njudgments of three Judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the Bill was published, informed\r\n\r\nopinion   has   become  inflamed  and  agitated   by\r\n\r\nforebodings  of  dire consequences.  An  institution\r\n\r\nthat  had worked reasonably well for about 140 years\r\n\r\nshould not be lightly tampered with. It has an  aura\r\n\r\nof  age;  and the issue now has become one on  which\r\n\r\nthe  principal  disputants are  the  traditionalists\r\n\r\nsupporting the jury and the rationalists questioning\r\n\r\nthe rational foundation or otherwise of jury trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romantic and emotional statements have been made\r\n\r\nabout  the  nature and character of jury  trials  by\r\n\r\nbrilliant legal luminaries in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two such statements would bear quoting if only to\r\n\r\nlay  bare  the  historical  inaccuracies  that  they\r\n\r\ncontain. About 200 years ago Lord Blackstone writing\r\n\r\nabout jury trials stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The liberties of England cannot but subsist, so\r\n\r\nlong as this palladium remains sacred and inviolate;\r\n\r\nnot  only from open attacks (which none will  be  so\r\n\r\nhardy   as  to  make),  but  also  from  all  secret\r\n\r\nmachinations,  which may sap and  undermine  it;  by\r\n\r\nintroducing new and arbitrary methods of  trial,  by\r\n\r\njustices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue,\r\n\r\nand  courts  of  conscience. And however  convenient\r\n\r\nthese   may  appear  at  first  (as  doubtless   all\r\n\r\narbitrary  powers,  well  executed,  are  the   most\r\n\r\nconvenient),  yet  let it be again  remembered  that\r\n\r\ndelays,  and  little inconveniences in the  form  of\r\n\r\njustice,  are  the price that all free nations  must\r\n\r\npay  for  their liberty in more substantial matters;\r\n\r\nthat  these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of  the\r\n\r\nnation  are fundamentally opposite to the spirit  of\r\n\r\nour constitution; and that, though begun in trifles,\r\n\r\nthe precedent may gradually increase and spread,  to\r\n\r\nthe  utter disuse of juries in questions of the most\r\n\r\nmomentous concern.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rudimentary knowledge of British social history\r\n\r\nwould  be  sufficient to show that at  the  time  he\r\n\r\nwrote,  Blackstone's liberties were but the property\r\n\r\nof  but  a  very  small  class of  British  society.\r\n\r\nParliamentary democracy based on adult  suffrage  is\r\n\r\nonly  one  generation old in Britain;  and  yet  the\r\n\r\npalladium  of  liberties has  become  a  catchphrase\r\n\r\namong some of our own legal luminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lord Devlin in writing about juries was able\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Each jury is a little Parliament. The jury sense\r\n\r\nis  the Parliament sense. I cannot see the one dying\r\n\r\nand the other one surviving. The first object of any\r\n\r\ntyrant   would   be   to  make  Parliament   utterly\r\n\r\nsubservient  to his will; and the next to  overthrow\r\n\r\nor  diminish  trail  by jury, for  no  tyrant  could\r\n\r\nafford  to have a subject's freedom in the hands  of\r\n\r\ntwelve  of his countrymen. So that trial by jury  is\r\n\r\nmore than an instrument of justice and more than one\r\n\r\nwheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows\r\n\r\nthat freedom lives.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can only be a piece of delightful rhetoric as\r\n\r\nthe  hard  facts  of British constitutional  history\r\n\r\nwould appear to militate against this assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In attempting to analyse the British attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  jury trial, two major matters ought  to  be\r\n\r\nkept  in mind. The first is that jury trial has  for\r\n\r\nlong been regarded as a bulwark against oppression;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  part of British tradition  and  still\r\n\r\nsurrounded by sentiment and emotion. The  second  is\r\n\r\nthat  whilst there have been attempts to assess  its\r\n\r\nefficacy, these are based on suppositions and not on\r\n\r\nhard facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these assertions made in support of juries\r\n\r\nshould  be tested against decided cases. If all  the\r\n\r\ncases  cited  in  Wade and Phillip's  Constitutional\r\n\r\nLaw, in the section on the Citizen and the State are\r\n\r\nexamined,  it  will be found that juries  played  an\r\n\r\ninsignificant part. When a jury was used,  the  jury\r\n\r\neither answered questions so put that the jury could\r\n\r\nnot have known in whose favour they were finding, or\r\n\r\nfollowed the Judge's opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who take seriously the assertion that\r\n\r\nthe  jury  is  a  safeguard of the  liberty  of  the\r\n\r\nsubject should read Howell's State Trials where  all\r\n\r\nthe political trials worth noting are recorded. Many\r\n\r\nof  them are sedition trials and for every acquittal\r\n\r\nthere  was a conviction to balance it. In 1792 Paine\r\n\r\nwas  convicted  for publishing the  Rights  of  Man,\r\n\r\nwhile  in  1793  his publisher Eaton  was  virtually\r\n\r\nacquitted.  Daniel Holt was convicted in  1793,  and\r\n\r\ncompletely  ruined, for publishing  suggestions  for\r\n\r\nmild  reform  of  the  franchise  and  parliamentary\r\n\r\nconstituencies. Further examples could be multiplied\r\n\r\nif  need  be.  The only cure for the  admiration  of\r\n\r\nthese  juries  is to read the State  Trials  and  to\r\n\r\nponder  over  the question of whether  these  juries\r\n\r\nwere  lamps  that  showed  that  freedom  lived   or\r\n\r\ninstruments of oppression and prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the qualifications and mode of\r\n\r\nselection of jurors would throw further light on the\r\n\r\ncharacter of British juries. A juror must be  a  \ufffd10\r\n\r\nfreeholder or a \ufffd20 leaseholder, or a householder in\r\n\r\na  valuation list of \ufffd30 in London and Middlesex  or\r\n\r\n\ufffd20  elsewhere, or occupy a house with not less than\r\n\r\n15 windows. This meant that jury service was largely\r\n\r\nconfined to the middle and upper classes. It is only\r\n\r\nby  some  stretch of the imagination  that  a  lower\r\n\r\nclass  prisoner could be said to be tried by \"twelve\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of his countrymen\". The views and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprejudices of jurors were more apt to be those  of\r\n\r\nthe  middle  classes  than  those  of  the  poorer\r\n\r\nclasses. In political terms it is true to say that\r\n\r\njurors  tend by and large to be supporters of  the\r\n\r\nConservative Party than the Labour Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Juries Act, 1922, the quaint practice\r\n\r\nof   striking  a  jury  from  a  panel  of  jurors\r\n\r\nobtained.  A  case  decided  early  this   century\r\n\r\nillustrates how this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lygon, M.P. (Conservative) brought a libel\r\n\r\naction against Mr Greenwood, M.P. (Liberal) and a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  owned  by Mr Winfrey, M.P.  (Liberal).\r\n\r\nMr  Lygon  had  said that he was against  feeding\r\n\r\nschool children out of the rates, and he was cited\r\n\r\nas  being  against  feeding school  children,  the\r\n\r\nwords \"out of the rates\" being omitted, so that  a\r\n\r\nfearsome  innuendo  arose.  A  special  jury   was\r\n\r\nordered    to   be   struck.   The    venue    was\r\n\r\nNorthamptonshire, so the Sheriff of  that  country\r\n\r\nsent  the  special jury list to his  London  agent\r\n\r\nbefore whom the parties appeared and balloted  for\r\n\r\n48  names.  Another appointment, a day later,  was\r\n\r\nmade for 'striking'. The plaintiffs' solicitor  at\r\n\r\nonce  set  off  for Northampton, followed  by  the\r\n\r\ndefendants' solicitor, to find out the politics of\r\n\r\nthe  panel. The result showed 35 Conservatives and 13  Liberals. The next day with unerring  accuracy\r\n\r\nthe  plaintiff struck out 12 out of  13  Liberals,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the defendant said he objected to  the  12\r\n\r\n\"most  violent Tories\". That left 23 Conservatives\r\n\r\nand  one  Liberal. At the Assizes the one  Liberal\r\n\r\ngot  in  on the ballot and because he was a quiet,\r\n\r\nunobtrusive  Liberal, he was made foreman  of  the\r\n\r\njury and he brought down the verdict from \ufffd500  to\r\n\r\n\ufffd100  by \"sticking out\". Had that particular panel\r\n\r\nbeen  36  Conservatives to 12 Liberals, the  trial\r\n\r\njury  would  have been all Conservatives.  One  is\r\n\r\nleft with the question as to whether there is  any\r\n\r\nneed  to introduce these picturesque imponderables\r\n\r\ninto a mature system of administration of justice,\r\n\r\nthe  essential characteristics of which should  be\r\n\r\ncertainty and uniformity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predominant tendency in Britain today is to\r\n\r\nhave  fewer  and  fewer jury  trials,  and  it  is\r\n\r\ndoubtful  indeed  that  if Britain  were  given  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  start  anew,  she  would  deliberately\r\n\r\nchoose to have jury trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must seek to\r\n\r\ndiscover  the  meaning of the  assertion  that  in\r\n\r\nbeing tried by a jury, one is tried by one's peers\r\n\r\nor  by  one's neighbourhood. The formula  goes  as\r\n\r\nfollows. \"Was the prisoner willing to be judged by\r\n\r\nthe  neighbourhood? Would he put himself upon  his\r\n\r\ncountry? If so, let him plead not guilty and  take\r\n\r\ntheir verdict.\" In Britain it is still true that a\r\n\r\nworking class prisoner is never tried by his peers\r\n\r\nor  his neighbourhood. More so in a multi-cultural\r\n\r\nsociety like Singapore. Strictly, we should  allow\r\n\r\nthat a Malay-speaking prisoner should be tried  by\r\n\r\na  Malay  jury, a Chinese prisoner  by  a  Chinese\r\n\r\njury,  a  Tamil prisoner by a Tamil jury,  and  an\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  prisoner by an  English-speaking\r\n\r\njury.  The  irrational prejudices,  the  attendant\r\n\r\nlack  of  certainty and uniformity and  the  havoc\r\n\r\nthat   would  be  injected  into  the  system   of\r\n\r\nadministration of justice should be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nmake any sensible person sit up and re-examine the\r\n\r\nfoundations of our society. It is always dangerous\r\n\r\nto  think in vacuo. When Lord Devlin assessed  the\r\n\r\nvirtues  of  trials by jury, he rested  his  views\r\n\r\nupon  the  matrix of British experience. He  dealt\r\n\r\nwith particulars and postulated no universals; and\r\n\r\nthis  is reason enough for us to ensure that these\r\n\r\ntraditional  notions  and  institutions   are   so\r\n\r\nadjusted as to fit squarely into the fabric  of  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society. Justice must be seen  to  be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the proposed trial by\r\n\r\nthree  Judges would make for more rational,  uniform\r\n\r\nand  fairer trials. The accused will have  the  same\r\n\r\nold  safeguards.  The allegations against  him  must\r\n\r\nbe  proved beyond reasonable doubt. He can  only  be\r\n\r\nconvicted  of an offence known to and defined  by  a\r\n\r\nwritten  law.  Judges, by their  very  training  and\r\n\r\nexperience, would be and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  free from caprice and prejudice  in  the\r\n\r\nperformance of their functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very oddly remarked that abolition of\r\n\r\njuries would lead to executive interference with the\r\n\r\njudiciary.  This  must  inevitably  imply  that  our\r\n\r\nJudges  lack  integrity and a  sense  of  their  own\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   in  the  performance   of   their\r\n\r\nfunctions. I should rather think, however, that they\r\n\r\nwould  respond more easily to problems of conscience\r\n\r\nand  the  basic rights of citizens than any jury  is\r\n\r\nable  to  do. For the nature of their work  requires\r\n\r\nthat  Judges  should be much more  than  mere  legal\r\n\r\ntechnicians. They would, for the most part,  be  men\r\n\r\nwho  understand values and have deep convictions  on\r\n\r\ngreat social questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only remains for me to say that clause 3 (3) of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill should be deleted. If three Judges of  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court are unable to arrive at a decision either\r\n\r\nunanimously  or by majority, the Court  must  acquit\r\n\r\nand  discharge the accused, and there should  be  no\r\n\r\nquestion of a retrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step, Mr Speaker, Sir, in legal reform\r\n\r\nshould  now  have  to do with the whole  problem  of\r\n\r\ncapital punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I associate myself with the\r\n\r\nviews in support of the Bill expressed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit  Panjang. However, in addition thereto  I\r\n\r\nhave certain observations to make on the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether the jury system is an\r\n\r\nintegral  and an indispenable facet of criminal  law\r\n\r\npractice and adjudication in our courts today  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which  inevitably involves  lawyers.  This\r\n\r\nmust  be  so  because the system  is  basic  in  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  jurisprudence  in  which  the  lawyer   is\r\n\r\ndisciplined.  In the lawyer's eyes the  jury  system\r\n\r\nand  justice  in criminal law are concomitant.  They\r\n\r\nsay  that  if  you  leave the  jury  system  out  of\r\n\r\ncriminal adjudication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the courts, you have impaired justice  by\r\n\r\nso much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system, Sir, has been practised in Common Law\r\n\r\ncountries  for some hundreds of years and  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries   which  still  retain  the  system,   its\r\n\r\noperation  had not been seriously questioned  as  to\r\n\r\ninitiate a thorough examination of the system with a\r\n\r\nview  to discovering its efficacy in a given society\r\n\r\nwith  varying  social values or varying  ethnic  and\r\n\r\ncultural responses. In fact, it has been the subject\r\n\r\nof  continuous  commentary for  the  period  of  200\r\n\r\nyears,  almost  from Blackstone to Lord  Devlin, so\r\n\r\nthat  now  it  appears to be hallowed with  such  an\r\n\r\nindispensability   in   the   field   of    criminal\r\n\r\njurisprudence that the Bill now before the House  is\r\n\r\nto some lawyers anathema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regard the jury system as an ingenious and\r\n\r\npractical  instrument  of  justice  of  considerable\r\n\r\nnicety, but depending on what context it is supposed\r\n\r\nto  operate. As a citizen I would look to  the  jury\r\n\r\nsystem  for reassuring signs of its efficacy  as  an\r\n\r\ninstrument  of  justice  in  the  context   of   the\r\n\r\nrealities within which it is meant to operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of this Bill are that in any trial of\r\n\r\na  capital offence, three Judges will make a finding\r\n\r\non  the  facts of the case which up to now has  been\r\n\r\nthe  function of the jury, and they will proceed  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  the law and return the verdict.  By  this\r\n\r\nBill, therefore, the jury system is abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which ought to matter is whether this\r\n\r\nsystem  of  trial  by three Judges will  ensure  the\r\n\r\nconsistency  of justice which is desired  and  which\r\n\r\nthe  jury system apparently does not assure in  this\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,  multi-cultural social milieu  of  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  If  the function of the jury is limited  to\r\n\r\nmaking  a  finding  on the facts of  the  case,  why\r\n\r\ncannot three Judges make an equally just, if  not  a\r\n\r\nbetter finding of the facts? If the Judges' capacity\r\n\r\nto  make a suitable finding of the facts is doubted,\r\n\r\nwhat  do  these critics have to say about the  fact-findings of the Judges in civil matters in the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  and  in  the subordinate civil  and  criminal\r\n\r\ncourts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, opposers of the Bill argue that the jury\r\n\r\nsystem provides the opportunity for the community to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  administration  of   law   and\r\n\r\njustice.  Such participation is negligible.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase  would  non-participation of the administration\r\n\r\nof  law  and justice in the lower subordinate courts\r\n\r\nto  any  extent impair the judgment of  our  Judges?\r\n\r\nWhat  about  the mass convictions in the subordinate\r\n\r\ncriminal  courts? It has never been  theorised  that\r\n\r\nsuch convictions are questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the merit of this Bill is simply\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  in trials of capital  offences,  it\r\n\r\nremoves from the functions of the Judge that arduous\r\n\r\nand complex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntask  of  directing the jury on which would  usually\r\n\r\ndepend  the  question of affirming or  allowing  the\r\n\r\nconviction in the Court of Appeal. To sum up it  may\r\n\r\nbe  said that this Bill saves justice from having to\r\n\r\nprecariously tread on the high wire of  the  summing\r\n\r\nup and therefore stabilise her image in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
