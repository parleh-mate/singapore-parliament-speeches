Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year ICA cleared more than 130 million people through our checkpoints.&nbsp; Sir, given the sheer volume of travellers, it is not reasonable to expect ICA to be able to pick out every single <I>mala fide</I> visitor.&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, no country has achieved such standards based on current technology. &nbsp;ICA takes an approach that balances security imperatives with clearance efficiency, adopting a multi-layered people clearance framework to sieve out and prevent the entry of undesirable persons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We currently require foreigners holding certain travel documents to apply for visas before they arrive in Singapore.&nbsp; ICA would only approve the application if ICA assesses that their visit to Singapore is <I>bona</I> <I>fide</I>. &nbsp;The traveller's particulars, facial image and visa information will be transmitted to ICA's checkpoint clearance system prior to his arrival in Singapore.&nbsp; This helps to detect travellers who attempt to enter Singapore with a tampered passport, or without a valid visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the checkpoints, all travellers, arriving or departing Singapore, are subject to face-to-face immigration checks and passport screening. &nbsp;ICA has developed an integrated people screening system known as Matrix.&nbsp; This system is capable of high speed, accurate travel document detection and counter-forging capabilities. &nbsp;The travellers' particulars will also be checked against our records. &nbsp;In addition, ICA officers will conduct risk profiling by asking them questions on why they are visiting Singapore and observe their reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a traveller fail to meet our entry requirements, react suspiciously or if his purpose of entry is doubtful, he will be referred to the Duty Officer at the checkpoint for more in-depth checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, ICA detected about 1,000 foreign visitors who attempted to enter Singapore using dubious travel documents.&nbsp; Another 78 foreign visitors were detected attempting entry by impersonation, that is to say, using passports that belong to someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For travellers suspected to be ex-immigration offenders or persons of security interest, ICA will run their fingerprints through the Biometric Database for Immigration Clearance (BDIC) System which was introduced in June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as for the three cases of illegal entry that Mr Steve Chia mentioned, the Filipina and Chinese woman had used genuine passports issued by the proper authorities under a different identity to re-enter Singapore.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not just Singapore that must ensure that only <I>bona fide</I> travellers are allowed in. Other countries must also play their part&nbsp;to ensure that their passport issuance procedures and controls are robust.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combating this <I>modus operandi</I> was one of the main reasons for introducing the BDIC system. In fact, it was the alertness of the ICA officer to take and screen the Filipina's fingerprints through this system that she was caught. &nbsp;As for the Chinese woman, she was eventually detected by the Police's crime database upon her arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the implementation of the BDIC system, ICA has detected more than 700 ex-immigration offenders and other persons on record attempting to enter through our checkpoints by using false identities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the stolen passport used by the Croatian war criminal, at that time, our checkpoints did not have real-time access to Interpol's database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a limitation to the number of lost and stolen foreign passports that can be blacklisted in our database. &nbsp;We understand that Interpol currently has more than 10 million lost or stolen passport records in its database. &nbsp;Obviously, it is not practical for any country to simply store all these into its database.&nbsp; As such, ICA had to prioritise in deciding which lost or stolen passport information should be listed in its blacklist.&nbsp; Now even if ICA were to increase its capacity to store information on lost passports, it can only store a fraction of the number of passports reported lost or stolen by Interpol.&nbsp; It is for this reason that ICA is actively engaging Interpol on how ICA can have access to the new Mobile Interpol Network Data (MIND) system that will facilitate real-time screening against Interpol's database during immigration clearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The false identity in the passport used by the war criminal was also unknown and unavailable at the time of his purported travels in Europe and the region, including Singapore in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst it is impossible for ICA to detect every single <I>mala fide</I> traveller, what we can do is to make it as difficult as possible for undesirable persons to slip into or out of Singapore. That is why when we discover shortcomings or gaps in our systems or procedures, we will analyse what went wrong, and take prompt corrective action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, ICA is pursuing several new measures to deter and detect foreigners who attempt to use fake or stolen passports to enter Singapore. For example, apart from listing lost or stolen foreign passports, including blank passports, in ICA's clearance system whenever it receives such information from its foreign counterparts, ICA has been beefing up its intelligence capabilities. &nbsp;ICA works closely with Home Team agencies and its foreign counterparts to issue regular intelligence alerts to frontline officers on the latest <I>modus operandi</I> of passport abusers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, ICA has been actively engaging Interpol to share information on lost and stolen passports.&nbsp; A project, expected to be completed by the end of this year, will leverage on Interpol's database system to allow online checks at the checkpoints for passports that have been reported lost or stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICA is also studying enhancing the BDIC system to make use of facial and photo recognition technology to enable real-time screening of travellers against a database that includes known terrorists and wanted persons during immigration clearance. This will help us detect any person assuming a different identity or using a different passport to gain entry into Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, later this year, ICA plans to start issuing biometric passports and will equip the checkpoints with scanners that can read biometric passports. &nbsp;As more countries issue biometric passports, this will further restrict the space for terrorists' movement by tightening passport controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Sir, ICA will continue to review and enhance its multi-layered people clearance framework to deter undesirable persons from using fake or stolen passports to enter Singapore.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):&nbsp;</B> I thank the Senior Minister of State for his long and comprehensive reply.&nbsp; I have two supplementary questions.&nbsp; First of all, how can other countries issue new passports to their citizens under a different name for them to come to Singapore?&nbsp; Something must be done, especially with our Asian counterparts, to send the message to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point is, with all these new securities that are being added, with&nbsp;Interpol and&nbsp;biometric scanning, are we going to expect zero case now or minimum?&nbsp; What kind of assurance can we get that there will be no more such breaches in security?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, undergraduate fees at NUS and NTU have been increased regularly since 1990.&nbsp; The exceptions, where fees were kept unchanged, were during&nbsp;two periods.&nbsp; These were the two periods that followed years in which&nbsp;the economy was going through a decline, namely, 1999-2000 and 2002-2004.&nbsp; With the exception of these two periods, we have had fee increases each year.&nbsp; I am circulating a table in response to Mr Steve Chia's request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undergraduate fees in the two universities increased by an average, if I take the averages over that period of years,&nbsp;of 8% per year in the 1990s, and&nbsp;an average of slightly less than 2% per year since 2000, in other words, 2000-2006, including the forthcoming academic year.&nbsp; For the period as a whole, if one takes&nbsp;1990 up to this forthcoming academic year of 2006, fees have increased by an average of 5% per year.&nbsp; This includes, as you can see from the table, a large increase of 45% in 1991.&nbsp; After 1991, fee increases have averaged 3% per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia has asked how this compares with the rate of inflation.&nbsp; The most relevant benchmark of inflation or cost pressures for a university is wage inflation.&nbsp; This is because universities are essentially human enterprises, with 70% of their costs, at least, coming from&nbsp;manpower.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1990 to 2005, wages went up nationally by an average of 5% per year.&nbsp; As we know, wage increases for professionals are under greater pressure.&nbsp; They are increasing faster, not just in Singapore, but globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, fees have been increased regularly in our universities.&nbsp; These fee increases&nbsp;have allowed the universities to meet cost pressures while improving on the quality of education they provide.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the fees at our universities remain competitively priced, compared to overseas universities of equivalent quality, such as in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government remains committed to substantially funding the costs of undergraduate education.&nbsp;&nbsp; The universities will continue to exercise prudence in their expenditures and keep costs in check.&nbsp; Together, the Government and the universities will work to ensure that university education remains affordable and that Singapore students who are admitted to our universities can enjoy a top-quality education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B>&nbsp; I thank the Minister for his reply.&nbsp; Looking at the figures, the average was 5% fee increase a year.&nbsp; That actually is a lot for the HDB heartlanders who are mostly earning below $3,400 (60% earning below $3,400).&nbsp; That is a lot of money.&nbsp; Can the Minister comment whether this constant university&nbsp;fee increase is spiralling out of control, out of&nbsp;reach of our HDB heartlanders?&nbsp; Is&nbsp;this spiralling&nbsp;also due to&nbsp;the universities' heavy dependency on expatriates?&nbsp; Sixty percent&nbsp;of the teaching population&nbsp;are expatriates with their families.&nbsp; Is it because of that, that our costs are escalating out of control?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> First, let me say that tertiary fee increases all over the world&nbsp;exceed the rate of inflation as reflected in the consumer price inflation.&nbsp; Our fee increases in Singapore have, in fact, been modest, compared to comparable countries.&nbsp; Just to give you a feel, if you take year 2000 up to now, where we have increased by slightly less than 2%, in the United States, if you take public universities, and I am not even talking about private universities, the increase has been about 9.5% per year or cumulative increase of 57%,&nbsp;seven times the increase that we have seen in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, the increase has been about 4% per year, or cumulative increase of 24%,&nbsp;three times the increase we have seen in Singapore over that period.&nbsp; It is a global phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe to help Mr Steve Chia understand it, because I think his question is genuine and he may not understand the way in which universities function, they are fundamentally different from normal business enterprises.&nbsp; In a normal business enterprise you can have a wage increase for your workers but you try and offset it through some technological or productivity improvement - produce more output for the same input so that your price does not need to go up so much,&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

That is why, nationally, we find wage increases are always higher than CPI&nbsp;and price increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the universities, it is different, because&nbsp;we do not want to compensate for faculty wage increases by increasing the number of students per faculty.&nbsp; In fact, on the contrary,&nbsp;we want, over time, to reduce the number of students per faculty, so as to be able to improve quality.&nbsp; Universities are in the business of producing quality graduates.&nbsp; Students must leave the university better educated, better prepared for the workforce, high income profile over time and, hopefully, better citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universities have to compete for faculty.&nbsp; They have to pay market rates in order to deliver quality students.&nbsp; When they think of the facilities they want, they have to provide high quality facilities, so as to ensure that students benefit from access to the latest technology.&nbsp; They are not in lecture rooms that are overcrowded, so that they are able to spend quality time with lecturers and even with the assistants of lecturers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way to go if we want to deliver an affordable but top-quality education to Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;we look at the models out there, there are basically two models.&nbsp; One is the European model.&nbsp; It is highly affordable&nbsp; -&nbsp; very heavily subsidised -&nbsp; but it is affordable low-quality education, overcrowded lecture rooms and a consistent brain drain year after year in the Sciences and Engineering, even in the Humanities, from Europe to the United States, and Britain benefiting to a&nbsp;minor extent from the brain drain from Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not the system we want.&nbsp; Providing affordable low-quality education will be a disaster for Singapore and for our economic strategies.&nbsp; What we want to do is to provide an affordable top-quality education.&nbsp; It is also what the Americans, the British and the Australians are trying to do.&nbsp; But where we differ from them is that we have a substantially higher public subsidy for our universities.&nbsp; And that is why the Australian universities have increased fees by three times more than Singapore universities in the last six years.&nbsp; That&nbsp;is also why the American public universities have increased fees by seven times more than Singapore in the last six years, because we have retained a very high commitment of public funding for our universities.&nbsp; As we discussed it extensively in last year's COS debate, and as I mentioned very explicitly, over the medium term, we want to move towards the Government funding 75% of the total cost of undergraduate education.&nbsp; Currently, we are still funding a little more than 75%.&nbsp; We do not intend to move there immediately but we will move there gradually.&nbsp; But that is still substantially higher public funding than any comparable country that is seeking to provide an affordable top-quality education, not an affordable low-quality education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is also the most equitable system to address Mr Chia's concern.&nbsp; If we want to subsidise universities more, where do we get the money from?&nbsp; I do not think we want to raise taxes.&nbsp; So it means taking it from the polytechnics, ITEs and schools.&nbsp; I do not think that is right for two reasons.&nbsp; The main reason is that university graduates in Singapore, as is the case all over the world, will earn a premium over graduates from other institutions of education.&nbsp; That is well known.&nbsp; We all know that.&nbsp; It is obvious the starting salaries and expected life-time earnings are higher.&nbsp; So it is not equitable to subsidise them more and more, not just keep a high level of subsidy but increase their share of the educational subsidy.&nbsp; It is just inequitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even at current levels of subsidy, we are subsidising university students substantially more than ITE students.&nbsp; So I think we have got to maintain a sense of perspective about this.&nbsp; First, how can we deliver top-quality education?&nbsp; I have explained that.&nbsp; We do not want the European model and we can do a better job than the Americans, the Australians and the British.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, what is equitable?&nbsp; I think what is equitable is that we put that extra dollar into our polytechnics, ITEs and schools where there is the Opportunity Fund or extra technology, improving the quality of our ITEs so that they can become centres of excellence in technical education, not increasing the share of subsidy going to our universities.&nbsp; So this is&nbsp;sensible from the point of view of human capital development, and it is also sensible from the point of view of being equitable.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This has allowed our economy to capitalise on growth opportunities which,&nbsp;in turn, has&nbsp;created jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Let me give Members the numbers.&nbsp; Last year, the economy created&nbsp;110,800 jobs, and&nbsp;61,000 of these jobs, or about 55%, went to locals.&nbsp; 61,000 is the highest annual employment created for locals on record, even surpassing pre-Asian financial crisis levels.&nbsp; I want to remind Members that every year, Singapore only produces about 31,000 new labour entrants.&nbsp; So we have created twice the number of jobs for locals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreigners currently comprise 29% of the workforce, or about 670,000 persons.&nbsp; This percentage is lower than in some previous years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia asked for a comparison.&nbsp; First, it is not meaningful to compare the percentage of foreigners in the workforce, because it depends on factors such as population growth, economic and industry needs.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp;if you want a comparison, the United Arab Emirates has 90%&nbsp;of foreigners in their workforce.&nbsp; So it is really what your economy needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have about 90,000 <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Employment</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Pass</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>&nbsp;holders, including approximately 25,000 S Pass holders. There are about 580,000 Work Permit holders.&nbsp; Of these, 160,000 are foreign domestic workers, and 135,000 in the construction sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia has asked for wage data for foreign workers.&nbsp; We do not have the specific data, but we have wage data across sectors and occupations which we publish regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chia has asked whether foreign workers lower the wages of low-wage workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have to understand that foreign workers, as a composite of flexible labour market policy, have created jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy is largely export-driven, wages in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are also affected by wages of workers in other countries, such as <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; For example, if we did not have the foreign construction&nbsp;workers, we will not complete our projects on time.&nbsp; The supervisors,&nbsp;safety officers,&nbsp;architects, quantity surveyors and&nbsp;engineers, who are mostly Singaporeans, will not be able to take on new projects.&nbsp; So it is not meaningful to look at the wage equation only as a function of whether they are foreign workers or not.&nbsp; In the first place, as I said, our economy has created jobs and&nbsp;given jobs to Singaporeans.&nbsp; If Singaporean workers continuously upgrade themselves and acquire the skills needed and increase productivity, they will enjoy higher wages. In fact, in&nbsp;2005,&nbsp;they did enjoy higher wages.&nbsp; It is not true that&nbsp;wages did not rise.&nbsp; Average nominal monthly earnings rose by about 3.5%&nbsp; -&nbsp; real earnings&nbsp;by about 3%, because our CPI index for inflation was 0.5%.&nbsp; With the economy projected to grow by 4%-6%&nbsp;this year,&nbsp;wages of workers are also likely to rise this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, our flexible labour market policies have allowed us to be competitive, grow the economy, create jobs for Singaporeans and increase the&nbsp;proportion of Singaporeans as professionals, managers, executives and&nbsp;technicians with good-paying jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CREDIT COUNSELLING SINGAPORE--><p align=left>Column No : 483<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CREDIT COUNSELLING SINGAPORE</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Indebted consumers seeking assistance-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Indebted consumers seeking assistance)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

I applaud the Prime Minister on his Budget Statement.&nbsp; Many people have told me that there is nothing substantial in this Budget.&nbsp; I suppose they are disappointed in that the PM did not announce further tax cuts nor did he abolish estate duty, to the disappointment of some living and some dead.&nbsp; But I see it differently.&nbsp; I see this Budget as further consolidating our economic restructuring.&nbsp; I am appreciative of the Progress Package.&nbsp; I believe this is necessary if we are to distinguish ourselves as a society and&nbsp;if we are to encourage young Singaporeans to grow deeper roots in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that globalisation will widen the income gap.&nbsp; And I fully support the Government's efforts to help those in the lower-income group, those unemployed and those less fortunate.&nbsp; I believe that this willingness to help the less able and less fortunate amongst us is, indeed, a hallmark of a great society.&nbsp; I note the concern of some colleagues in this House, that some people may take advantage of our kindness,&nbsp; our Progress Package, our Workfare Bonus, etc.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; There will always be some who will take advantage of others.&nbsp; However, I urge us to have that generosity of spirit, the magnanimity to see the relief that our assistance brings to those in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have many personal experiences to tell me that many Singaporeans have actually such a strong sense of pride and self-esteem that they will decline assistance unless they are actually in quite poor shape.&nbsp; So, let us never become a nation that knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.&nbsp; I have always believed that it is more blessed to give than to receive. On 22nd August 2005, <I>Business Times</I> interviewed a Mr Tom Huzell, head of Ikea's retail operations in Singapore and Malaysia.&nbsp; He is a Swede and Ikea is an international home furnishing company founded in Sweden.&nbsp; When he was asked how the Swedes could live with an average income tax of 40%, and higher earners pay about 50%, a VAT or GST of 25% with extra taxes on liquor and petrol, he replied that&nbsp;most Swedes found it very nice to live in Sweden.&nbsp; He went on to say that the quality of life was, indeed, very high and the Swedes were very egalitarian people.&nbsp; He shared that the high rates of tax meant that they had very little hierarchy and everybody was equal.&nbsp; Many Swedes I know share this sentiment, and they value their egalitarian way of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister has said that Singapore cannot follow the Nordic high-tax and high-spending model.&nbsp; He would like to pursue a low tax and tight expenditure model.&nbsp; I fully agree, and the low tax part gives me great personal relief.&nbsp; However, we should admire and emulate their egalitarian and communitarian attitude.&nbsp; I certainly hope that the low tax and tight expenditure policy, coupled with compassionate assistance to the less fortunate, will encourage more Singaporeans to pay their taxes cheerfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also hope to see Progress packages continuing year after year and not only coincidentally just before the elections.&nbsp; This is because we will always have the poor with us.&nbsp; There will always be some Singaporeans who fall between the cracks - some dysfunctional families, some maladjusted individuals, some unfortunate sick.&nbsp; These packages could take different forms, targeted at different needs.&nbsp; Perhaps, instead of only giving Progress packages where there are higher budget surpluses, the PM may wish to make it his priority to set aside, say, $1 billion every year for the Progress Package targeted at those Singaporeans.&nbsp; When there are surpluses, then even more can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some members of the public have some reservations about cash handouts.&nbsp; Most societies do it through free or highly subsidised welfare services of one kind or another.&nbsp; Sir, this old fashioned welfarism presupposes that the government is the most efficient producer of goods and services.&nbsp; That has been an article of faith of planned economies.&nbsp; And we now actually clearly see that after 50 years, the greater efficiency of the market economy shows that not to be the case.&nbsp; So I believe that cash bonuses will enable recipients to decide what goods and services they need to buy and from whom.&nbsp; Besides, the bonuses from the Progress packages are more targeted and, therefore, less open to abuse and misuse.&nbsp; I am in support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am appreciative of the welfare assistance, the many job creation and workers' training programmes.&nbsp; I believe that helping the unemployed, finding him a job, is much better than giving him handouts.&nbsp; I am happy to note that last year, 110,800 new jobs were created and unemployment rate is a low 2.5%.&nbsp; These new jobs bring cheer to many families, enable many young stomachs to be filled.&nbsp; With more people in jobs and progressively better-paying ones, we will need less Workfare and assistance, and future Progress packages can be even more targeted and, therefore, more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am interested in the big question of how do we build a competitive, growing and yet sustainable economy.&nbsp; Having been in Parliament for one year, I have learned to be dermatologically more fortified.&nbsp; Even after 45 other colleagues have spoken before me, I still feel that I have to ask this question again this year.&nbsp; I applaud the Government's effort to invest in R&amp;D to help us become a knowledge hub.&nbsp; The setting up of a R&amp;D Trust Fund, the RIEC, the NRF are all good things.&nbsp; Spending 3% of our GDP on research and development&nbsp;by 2010 will bring us closer to the R&amp;D's spending level in the Nordic countries.&nbsp; However, I hope that the RIEC and NRF will try their best to ensure that a progressively greater portion of these R&amp;D expenditures are spent together with the private sector and in the private sector.&nbsp; This is because the Nordic countries actually spend 60% of all their R&amp;D expenditures in the private sector.&nbsp; Ours is about 40% only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that because of this, there is better choice of research projects, earlier commercialisation of discoveries, and in all a better payback of their R&amp;D investments.&nbsp; They build great knowledge industries as we all know.&nbsp; The private sector cannot afford and does not believe in the pure pursuit of knowledge.&nbsp; And with our increase but still relatively modest R&amp;D expenditure, we really must try to get more bangs for our bucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore propose that RIEC and NRF, besides seeking to raise the R&amp;D expenditures to 3% of our GDP by 2010, set as their goal to involve and partner the private sector, so that 60% of the R&amp;D expenditure will be used and spent in the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides increasing our spending on R&amp;D and creating a safe and reliable environment for the protection of IPR, I believe there is yet another way to grow our knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; There is an observation that quite a lot of intellectual property is trapped in the public sector.&nbsp; This was noted in the deliberations of the ERC's Sub-committee on Services Industry in 2002 of which I was a member.&nbsp; It was noted that we have structural problems because the public sector is not mandated to grow their organisations via revenue from external sources.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;aware&nbsp;of the&nbsp;many advances and innovations made by our defence scientists in DSTA, system engineers in LTA, researchers in MOE, universities and hospitals.&nbsp; Some public agencies have acquired this IP in the course of their work when they tender for this and that project.&nbsp; Of course, there have been delightful stories of successful privatisation of PWD and SingTel.&nbsp; One recent story is that of former HDB's Architects and Town Planners Department, now reorganised as Surbana, designing a great motorcar showroom and racing track in Abu Dhabi.&nbsp; It would not have been possible or conceivable have they still been part of HDB.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to share with you that the Sub-committee recommended that we push on with corporatisation and privatisation of Government agencies; designate an agency to collate the inventory of such IP and&nbsp;sell or license them for commercialisation;&nbsp;&nbsp;incentivise research institutions and universities to consider licensing their IPs; and support technology and skills transfer from Government IP owners to Singapore-based companies as well as co-develop technology with them.&nbsp; I hope the Government will implement these recommendations so that Singapore-based companies can commercialise their IP and build profitable businesses with them.&nbsp; This proven IP should provide quicker returns than doing new projects.&nbsp; It will enable us to further broaden and deepen our capabilities,&nbsp;strengthen and grow our economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we upgrade our manufacturing sector, I have been told that Singapore needs to have a total manufacturing eco-system environment.&nbsp; It appears that because of our costlier environment, manufacturers of small parts cannot survive in Singapore.&nbsp; Unlike China, Taiwan and Vietnam, we do not have these downstream and often low-tech, low-cost industries.&nbsp; I suppose they like to see the situation of a little town outside Shanghai&nbsp;- I believe it is called Wenzhou - where most of the world's cigarette lighters and maybe cigars flame-throwers are made.&nbsp; Different brands, different styles, different qualities, different costs.&nbsp; And there are companies that supply millions of flint grinders.&nbsp; Some people make millions of these little gas fuel casings and gas nozzles, and many other parts that are needed to make cigarette lighters.&nbsp; I wonder what has happened to our efforts to promote Batam and Bintan industrial parks.&nbsp; I think Johor could make a good partner with cheaper land and labour.&nbsp; Together with them, we can perhaps provide this eco-system that manufacturers like to have.&nbsp; With the return towards stability in Indonesia and our improved relationships with them and Johor, it is perhaps time to revisit and reinvigorate this win-win strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the service industries, I agree that we cannot afford low cost as an attraction.&nbsp; But we can surely offer trust, quality and service.&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to declare my interest as Chairman of Raffles Medical Group.&nbsp; In healthcare, we can offer patient safety, professional reliability, service consistency, cost predictability and institutional governance to foreign patients.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>I am heartened to note that in 2005, we received, as a nation, 374,000 foreign patients who came here to seek treatment.&nbsp; At the growth rate of 20%, we will reach our target of 1 million patients by 2012.&nbsp; I am sure the public and private sectors will continue to move together to make Singapore the leading healthcare hub in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, despite my optimism, I still have a few concerns about Singapore being the logical and default service hub for the region.&nbsp; Others are trying to compete with us to do the same.&nbsp; My concerns are that some of the excellent and insightful recommendations of the ERC Sub-committee on service industries have yet to be implemented. With your indulgence, may I quote from the Report, paragraph 5,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Nevertheless, in many services, the exportable component seldom exceeds the local demand.&nbsp; It is therefore natural for the regulator to put priority on regulation to address social, political concerns of the domestic demand ahead of industry development.&nbsp; Powerful regulations often end up hindering the growth of the exportable component.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paragraph 6:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"In some sectors, Government inevitably gets deeply involved in the services sector&nbsp;beyond being a mere regulator to become a dominant player.&nbsp; When it also tries to be a promoter of exportable component, it becomes largely ambivalent.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, four recommendations were made.&nbsp; Recommendation No. 1: regulator cannot be the promoter.&nbsp; But the regulator must be sympathetic to the industry's development.&nbsp; Recommendation No. 2: regulator must not also be a player.&nbsp; In other words, Government should actively outsource such services to local enterprises wherever possible.&nbsp; Recommendation No. 3: promote regional and global demand.&nbsp; I am glad this has been done by agencies, like STB and EDB.&nbsp; Recommendation No. 4: stimulate sophisticated local demand.&nbsp; I believe some stimulation is done like placing out reserves for private fund management.&nbsp;I hope the Government will revisit these observations and recommendations and implement them across all service industries. I believe we can even exceed our targets, if we have the conviction to follow through these recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On land pricing,&nbsp;as property prices move upwards, we can all see that the Chief Valuer is not wasting any time.&nbsp; He is vigilant and has revised development charges upwards steeply.&nbsp; I expect he will have adequate justification.&nbsp; I certainly hope he will&nbsp;just be as quick to revise these charges downwards when the property market dips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, rising property prices make everyone feels good. Banks lend more money at better rates, non-performing loan&nbsp;(NPL) portfolio becomes smaller,&nbsp;professional services do well and the Government collects more stamp duties and fees. I like to remind us to be careful about our land prices.&nbsp; We must never allow ourselves to be priced out of the market and become an uncompetitive economy.&nbsp;We must be prepared to make exceptions for industries and sectors which will bring greater economic benefits downstream to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high land price for such industry is equivalent to taking a one-time capital gain upfront.&nbsp; Alternatively, we can have&nbsp;a lower land price but take the economic benefits like jobs, reduce assistance pay-outs and more taxes over the next few years.&nbsp; One outstanding example is the land around Changi Airport.&nbsp;We all know that Changi Airport is the only international gateway into Singapore, unlike other countries that have many cities and&nbsp;airports.&nbsp; When airlines bypass us, many tourists, businessmen, investors, private banking clients, foreign patients would be lost to the Singapore economy.&nbsp;The Government has rightly said that the survival of Changi Airport is more important than the survival of SIA, our national carrier.&nbsp; That was the rationale for allowing and encouraging low-cost carriers into Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see Changi Airport land price zero-rated. I would like to see the key performance indicators of CAAS to be those of the number of flight arrivals and departures, number of passenger throughputs, number of cities and regions to which Changi Airport is connected.&nbsp; I would be less interested in how much money CAAS makes.&nbsp; Yes, we can keep that as a score, to measure the efficiency. Instead of collecting higher landing fees and charges, I would rather the Singapore economy benefits along the way as tourists, shoppers, private banking clients, businessmen, foreign patients, patronise our banks, hotels, retail outlets, restaurants and hospitals.&nbsp; This multiple effect not only makes financial sense but it is also more likely to create the kind of jobs our older and less educated Singaporeans will be able to have and do well in.&nbsp; Singapore still collects the fees but over a longer period and downstream, instead of at the top, upstream.&nbsp;I believe Dubai has taken this approach and their thriving busy airport has brought people from many lands to a once sleepy desert town, and Dubai Inc. has benefited. Their approach may be less rational and disciplined.&nbsp; But it has worked for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on growing human talent, I am appreciative of what has been done in recent years by MOE.&nbsp; I am also very glad to hear that 25% of each cohort will go to publicly funded universities.&nbsp; In my time,&nbsp;which was slightly less than 40 years ago, it was 10%-11% only.&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to declare my interest as an SMU Trustee and RJC Board member.&nbsp; We all know that this has been a great factor in our society, spending more on education, creating more places for people,&nbsp;and this has helped us to have the kind of upward social mobility. And actually, many of us in this House have benefited from our own publicly funded university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that PM has given emphasis to investing in and developing our own people, whether talented or not, whether they are talent or no talent.&nbsp; Yes, we must grow our own timber for our own saplings will grow deeper roots in Singapore soil and hopefully withstand monsoons and typhoons.&nbsp; The PM quoted Peter Drucker and I agree that Singapore must actively attract talent from everywhere.&nbsp; America has been the beneficiary of successive tides of talent migration.&nbsp; We must do likewise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, unlike businesses that Drucker referred to, they can relocate their domicile.&nbsp; We are a nation and we certainly cannot relocate our domicile.&nbsp; As the late Mr Rajaratnam asked in the television clip I saw, \"Where can 2.5 million Singaporeans go?\"&nbsp; So I hope we will always reassure our own people that regardless of whether they are considered talent or not, we will invest in them and help them to realise their potential. I am glad we now have many routes to success and many paths to glory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I congratulate the PM on setting up the Opportunity Funds to provide more enrichment opportunities for needy students.&nbsp; This will certainly help these students to develop and compete better beyond subsidised school fees, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I agree with the PM that this Budget aims to build a vibrant economy where opportunities abound and an inclusive society where no one is left behind.&nbsp; I am proud to be a Singaporean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the motion, and I will pay my taxes cheerfully.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.55 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed very challenging to be the last speaker to respond to the Budget Statement.&nbsp; However, this time I did not cut my speech, although I have seriously considered doing it after&nbsp;two days of speeches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak in this debate.&nbsp; Sir, the Budget 2006 financial package will certainly resonate well among the majority of heartlanders, especially the lower income and the elderly.&nbsp; At the core of this Budget is not just what the Government is giving out to the people. &nbsp;Rather, it is the principle behind the handout that is important.&nbsp; Just as it is easy to be distracted by the glitter in a diamond, the discerning buyer will look at it with&nbsp;the eye of a gemologist. She will examine the precious stone, not for its glitter, but its cut, grade, colour and clarity.&nbsp; I believe today Singaporeans are knowledgeable, mature and well-read to be able to appreciate that this is a Government that has the people close to its heart.&nbsp; It shows that the many feedback sessions, dialogue sessions and face-to-face engagement between the people and the Government at the constituencies and elsewhere did not fall on deaf ears.&nbsp; In difficult times, the people are called upon to tighten their belts.&nbsp; When there is a good harvest, the Government shares the harvest with the people.&nbsp; Our financial policy is effective because it is coherent, consistent and as predictable as it is possible, while maintaining scope for flexibility and the use of judgement as and when the situation requires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past few years, there has been a shift in the global economic landscape which saw the emergence of India and China among the leading economies in Asia.&nbsp; We have to adjust our economy to keep pace with the tectonic movement in the global economy.&nbsp; As a result, a percentage of our population, particularly the older and less skilled workers, is displaced.&nbsp; While the devastation they face is nowhere compared to the thousands who lost their homes and livelihoods from natural disasters as earthquakes and landslides,&nbsp;the sufferings they face deserve our full support and assistance.&nbsp; Indeed, the Government has acted promptly and put in place many schemes, including the latest measures announced in the Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three&nbsp;concerns.&nbsp; Older workers, however, thus far the efforts to help these workers navigate the terrain to get back to the mainstream workforce have not yielded sufficient numbers.&nbsp; The momentum has to pick up so that we can attract more to come forward and pick up new skills the way the infectious Latin America drum beats&nbsp;draw the crowds to the dance floor.&nbsp; For these older workers, the cost of living has moved up and those without jobs will find themselves still swimming in turbulent waters though they now have a lifeline thrown to them.&nbsp; Some of the retraining programmes require them to undergo classes to gain some literacy in English and Arithmetics.&nbsp; We have to recognise that these workers, some in their 50s, 60s and illiterate, will find it very difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to consider the mindset of these older generation of workers and to set up an inter-Ministry body to look at how we can better understand and motivate them, how we can come&nbsp;out with solutions that fit into their minds.&nbsp; I always believe that they want to help themselves.&nbsp; But what they want to do is not always what the civil servants and&nbsp;MPs think what they should do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will remain obdurate to&nbsp;classroom learning no matter what you offer them.&nbsp; The idea is not to put&nbsp;oneself in a position where we find ourselves and the workers in two opposite polar positions.&nbsp; If there is no way to bring them to the classrooms, can these older workers pick up other skill sets, like simple vocational skills training?&nbsp; Help them to adapt without going through the ABC route.&nbsp; Teach them the skills that they may be well more suited to.&nbsp; For example, mend shoes, repair clocks and watches, repair the new dual flush cisterns where Environment is going to make it compulsory as a water saving device, make handicraft, prune shrubs and&nbsp;landscape gardens, polish furniture and repair leather upholstery.&nbsp; With these skills, they can go out and either work for someone&nbsp;or set up their own little businesses.&nbsp; Offer them some seed funding and give them the stall licences and let them move on with life without having to agonise learning ABC.&nbsp; Limit the options to those who are without any primary qualifications and are above 50 years old.&nbsp; Provide the seed money for them to set up their own business.&nbsp; Offer them the second chance to be their own boss, and it may rekindle their interest to take up the challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In similar context, we have helped the older workers and the lower skilled workers in their 60s and 70s by the direct allocation of stalls in the markets and hawker centres.&nbsp; We saw how they were able to bring up their children and many have since progressed and done well in life.&nbsp; For example, I know of a hawker in Toa Payoh who brought up three sons.&nbsp; All of them graduated from universities and are doing very well.&nbsp;There have been concerted efforts to help this strata of people which today we are seeing in numbers again because of the globalisation of economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, some of these retraining courses are very long.&nbsp; I am currently arranging for our market and hawker stallholders to attend&nbsp;GEMS courses, introduced by Minister Raymond Lim, taking advantage of the coming market and hawker centre's two-day closure for washing.&nbsp; NTUC's Learning Hub has helped me to organise this session together with our grassroots leaders, as we believe that GEMS courses</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We will conduct the course in Mandarin, with direct interpretation for our Malay stallholders.&nbsp; WDA insisted that the session must be for eight hours before the necessary funding can be made available.&nbsp; For these hawkers and stallholders, to tie them up for one whole day of the two-day closure means a lot to them.&nbsp; The second day closure is meant to be spent cleaning their stalls to get them ready for the next day's operation.&nbsp; Hence, it is a lot to ask them to spend one whole day for training.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really cannot understand WDA's rationale.&nbsp; I would have to raise funds for these people to attend the classes if I am not able to convince and persuade the stallholders to spend&nbsp;one whole day with me for the GEMS.&nbsp; This would mean that I would not be able to tap on the Government's funding of about $40 million of the Budget, ie, not benefiting from it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The agency implementing these training programmes must understand the mindset of the people.&nbsp; They must recognise that there are times when you can only make small gains but, yet, this is important, rather than try to attain the summit and never reach it.&nbsp; They must be flexible in the administration and implementation, so that the training budget, painstakingly set aside by the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, is within the reach of the people to whom they are meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, portable medical insurance.&nbsp; This was highlighted five years ago.&nbsp; However, it has&nbsp;remained a written paper on&nbsp;someone's desk waiting to be adopted.&nbsp; This scheme is gravitating itself&nbsp;as a very&nbsp;important factor in the employment of&nbsp;older workers.&nbsp; For the past few years, many senior workers have realised that there is no longer life-long employment, not even in statutory boards.&nbsp; When there is life-long employment, the company's medical insurance premium would average out in a worker's working life.&nbsp; In current times, when there is no life-long employment, the cost of medical insurance is very expensive on the individual person if he needs to cover himself at age 41 and above.&nbsp; The cost of medical insurance for the individual or the new employer is tripled at least for a person aged 41, compared to a worker aged 30 and under.&nbsp; This has resulted in the reluctance of companies to employ workers above 41.&nbsp; This is definitely much more than looking at the white hair, as mentioned by&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I must congratulate and thank our Minister for Health for redesigning and giving each Singaporean a basic medical insurance coverage in our hospital care, ie, our MediShield.&nbsp; The question here is: is this basic medical hospital insurance sufficient to cover the active working life of an individual and also through his old age?&nbsp; Many do not think so and have to buy many other medical insurance policies on top of this basic coverage and also request for the employer to cover their medical hospital insurance.&nbsp; For the many who could afford, it is fine.&nbsp; But for the senior worker who is looking for a job and has no sufficient insurance coverage for himself, he would have to bargain hard with his new employer.&nbsp; With that, many would not be able to find suitable employment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health strongly believes that the comprehensive coverage without co-payment is not a sound insurance scheme for the people in the long term, which I fully agree.&nbsp; Once there is no co-payment, there will be abuses of the system not only at the insurance pay-out, but also at the medical care providers.&nbsp; The question is: how is the 41-year-old going to pay for his medical insurance premium if the insurance premium tripled and on the increase for a person aged 41 and above looking for employment?&nbsp; I am proposing the use of the 1% of the insurance premium, as set by the Ministry and Government agencies which pay to the civil servants' Medisave accounts, as a guided percentage to be paid by the employer.&nbsp; In addition, I would like to ask the Ministry of Health to allow for additional insurance premiums to be paid out of the individual's Medisave account, not for comprehensive coverage but with a cap for sufficient coverage in the working life of a person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I am appealing to the Prime Minister to put in more money in the Medisave for these older workers to be able to pay for the insurance premium, made portable as his personal insurance.&nbsp; The other issue is that the insurance company, as a business, would not take up this senior worker above age 41.&nbsp; We need the help of the Ministry of Health to tie on this additional insurance with the basic MediShield, firstly, to minimise the over-coverage and also to allow the insurance company a big base to average the higher risks of these senior workers so that it is at a reasonable cost to the worker or his employer to make it portable to him.&nbsp; I would like to appeal for the good working tripartite relationship between&nbsp;NTUC, employer associations and&nbsp;Ministry of Health to relook at the paper lying on someone's desk and make the medical insurance scheme portable for a person when young so that the medical insurance that covers himself could continue to be with him wherever he works and whenever he needs to retrain and change jobs to suit his skill and age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must start now.&nbsp; Even if we need to cut off at an age group, we would have to do so, as in the case of MediShield.&nbsp; This would enable our younger generation not to face the same situation as our senior workers now are facing.&nbsp; The employers will be more willing to employ the white-hair workers and let skill be the determining factor rather than the higher insurance cost, which would then be taken care of by the workers themselves, with the help from the tripartite relationship of the Government, employer associations and&nbsp;NTUC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On inter-Ministry approach, on a broader level, I note that we are moving towards a more inter-Ministry approach as we search for solutions, especially on policy formulation, from health issues to the focus on managing the effects of casino gambling.&nbsp; I have called for the setting up of more inter-Ministry bodies and committees to tackle&nbsp;the implementation of&nbsp;this Budget in the earlier part of my speech.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, for many people, from residents to even MPs, it is very time-consuming, tiring and frustrating having to deal&nbsp;with inter-Ministry issues.&nbsp; All too often, each Ministry will push to the other.&nbsp; The most classic example I have come across recently was when I asked for an additional lift&nbsp;for Kovan MRT Station.&nbsp; There is only one lift serving the residential estate but more to the market and hawker centres.&nbsp; The answer given was that there is no budget allocation from the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I am appealing for more budget for such essential&nbsp;amenities where many of our older residents use these lifts daily.&nbsp; Commuters go to the market and hawker centres daily.&nbsp; How do we justify spending millions on the artifacts beautifying our MRT stations but our residents have to struggle to get from one point to another?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made progress in cheaper lifts for our HDB estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;So please do the same for our MRT stations.&nbsp; Hundreds and thousands use this transport&nbsp;system daily and we need to encourage them because of our limited land for private cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will tap this inter-Ministry approach for some operation and implementation measures and to problem-solving on the ground issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to have ZIP, the \"zero in process\" for the Government agencies and Ministries.&nbsp; However, this is not heard of in the present time.&nbsp; I have been receiving complaints from the residents of Government agencies pushing to one another, especially so now that many agencies have also outsourced their routine maintenance works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other example is the clogging of open drains in the private estates.&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue is very complicating.&nbsp; If the drain has potholes or big holes, the agency in charge to repair is PUB, and the cleaning of drains is under the National Environment Agency (NEA).&nbsp; So the problem of clogging of drains cannot be resolved until both agencies work on it, ie, get the potholes repaired and then clean the drains.&nbsp; The residents are confused and would not be able to understand the fine differentiation of duties.&nbsp; So, in the meantime, the drains remain clogged with mosquitoes, and our residents are left at the risk of being bitten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that&nbsp;in one medical centre, the doctors from different disciplines meet regularly to exchange views on their patients' case files in a holistic approach to patient care.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be good if this practice is expanded at ministerial level even more.&nbsp; This inter-Ministry committee offers not only a multi-disciplinary and multi-perspective approach to a problem.&nbsp; It also cuts out the argle-bargle when Ministry officials have to deal with each other later on.&nbsp; The complexities of today's economic, political and social environment demand more collective effort to be put in by officials from the different Ministries, either in policy formulation or implementation and operation measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, I applaud the Prime Minister for his generosity towards the needy and the lower-income workers.&nbsp; The principle of sharing the goodies with the people is a policy that we will always adopt as part of our inclusive approach to achieve prosperity for all.&nbsp; Go the extra mile to help our older workers to get back to the job market and to help the lower-income workers.&nbsp; Enable the medical insurance to be portable, to be able to encourage our employers to engage our older workers.&nbsp; Adopt an inter-Ministry approach while we search for solutions to complex issues.&nbsp; We must similarly adopt the same approach in solving the ground operation issues.&nbsp; History will measure and judge the distance that we have gone in building up a prosperous and harmonious community and in making Singapore our best home.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS--><p align=left>Column No : 503<p>\r\n\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES--><p align=left>Column No : 503<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members for their views and suggestions, especially all those who have spoken in support of the Budget.&nbsp; I have heard all of them, including Mdm Cynthia Phua, and we will take up their views and act on them wherever it makes sense to do so.&nbsp; The specific issues which they have raised will be dealt with by respective Ministers during the Committee of Supply.&nbsp; In this response, I will just focus on the broad thrusts of the Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me start by addressing a question which many have asked - some rhetorically, others seriously.&nbsp; \"Is this an Election Budget, given its generous package of incentives?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I am glad that many Singaporeans and MPs are happy with this Budget.&nbsp; The provisions and measures, which we have taken, have received wide support.&nbsp; But this is not a Budget merely for the purpose of distributing hongbaos to get votes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a Budget with its feet on the ground and with its eye on the future.&nbsp; It is the result of consulting broadly and taking views from many people.&nbsp; We have had many committees - the Low Wage Workers committee, RECORD; Mdm Halimah Yacob and other Members of Parliament have participated in many of these sessions and worked hard to come up with initiatives which will achieve our social objectives, address problems and stand us in good stead for the long term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a Budget:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) to support our ongoing efforts to restructure the economy;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) to ensure that all Singaporeans can benefit from growth and can manage the impact of globalisation; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) that will maintain fiscal prudence and long term sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These schemes and initiatives have to be sound and sustainable.&nbsp; To make promises and to give money away - that is easy. &nbsp; But, to improve lives, to give hope, to provide opportunities, to have schemes which will lead to the objectives which we have set out, and not to the opposite of what we intend, to be affordable over the long term - that is much more difficult.&nbsp; This Budget makes the right long-term commitments so that the Government wins not just the next election, but also the mandate to govern over successive terms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are not issuing cheques thinking that maybe we will not be here after the elections.&nbsp; This is a Budget which we are taking responsibility for, because we have to answer for the outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><B><I>Growing the economy</I></B></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Budget supports our efforts to restructure and upgrade the economy, and sustain economic growth over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The restructuring over the last few years has not been easy.&nbsp; It has been painful.&nbsp; In 1999 and 2000 before the recession, we had about 13,000 retrenchments a year; more or less steady.&nbsp; But over the past few years, the retrenchment numbers went up sharply to as high as 26,000 in one year - 2001.&nbsp; This is real pain because every person in these numbers is a worker with family, with responsibilities, with a future, with worries.&nbsp; The retrenchments are now back down to 10,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been a painful experience but we have become stronger.&nbsp; Overall, we have become much more competitive.&nbsp; We have to press on with our restructuring and not to fear change.&nbsp; If you look at our companies, you can see that.&nbsp; PSA, which restructured and retrenched 600 workers, is now competitive again; able to hold its own, not just against Tanjung Pelepas, but Dubai Port, and many other competitors in the world.&nbsp; SIA, working with unions, has made major changes to cut costs and to operate more flexibly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But, we must never think that we have arrived.&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon made a very good speech yesterday pointing out that we live in a world where trade and political tensions still exist and will continue to simmer.&nbsp; He listed out the places where there is no level playing field.&nbsp; SIA - you want to open - there is obstruction.&nbsp; Each time you want to move, a new challenge comes up and we have to deal with it.&nbsp; That is the reality of the world.&nbsp; We accept it as it is.&nbsp; But, having come here and having strengthened ourselves, we have now to gird ourselves to tackle all those problems: to deal with a world which is changing at an ever increasing pace, to watch the trends, and to move quickly and decisively to respond to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The competition in the future is not just going to be about lower cost, but increasingly about higher value.&nbsp; I think we are well-placed for this competition.&nbsp; We have explained this in many ways.&nbsp; We now have one fresh way to present this, that is to look at four core strengths, CORE -</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) <B>C</B>onnected. Plugged into the global market, moving around goods, people, and information; through our seaports, through our airports, telecommunications, and our FTAs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) We are <B>O</B>pen. Open to ideas, capital and talent.&nbsp; Open to enterprise. Set up as a knowledge hub and a land of opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) We are <B>R</B>eliable. We enjoy a great reputation for trust, quality and consistency, and generally a very high reputation in Asia and around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) We are <B>E</B>nterprising. With a flexible mindset and the ability to anticipate, to learn, to adapt, and to move quickly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So CORE competencies. We must build on these strengths to stay ahead of the competition and keep the economy growing,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) to differentiate ourselves as a trusted centre for quality and service;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) to invest more in innovation and R&amp;D, and become a key node in the global network of people, ideas and businesses;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(c) to support entrepreneurship and enterprise; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(d) to maintain a tax system that is best for business, and will enable us to grow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me deal with these one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Going the extra mile for service</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, setting ourselves apart from our competitors through good service.&nbsp; Service excellence is a critical competitive advantage and it is as much about attitudes as it is about skills.&nbsp; If you are sitting on a production line and you scowl at the computer chip, it will not scowl back at you and it will not run away from you nor tell its friends about you.&nbsp; But if you are a shop attendant, an airline attendant, a waitress in a restaurant or a banker, and you scowl at your client or customer, you do not just do yourself harm, but also do the whole business and Singapore's reputation harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If we think about the IRs (Integrated Resorts), service quality is critical.&nbsp; One of the foreign bidders for the IR at Marina had HR executives who visited WDA (Workforce Development Agency) to find out what schemes we had to train workers and help them to find jobs.&nbsp; WDA asked the executives: \"What can we do to help to prepare the workers, help to prepare Singaporeans to support the IR, to take up the jobs there?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These HR executives replied that they will have in-house training to impart specific skills to the workers - how to turn the roulette wheel, how to dish out the cards, how to rake in the chips; these, they will train.&nbsp; There is no need for WDA to do that.&nbsp; But the most valuable training which the WDA can provide is to prepare Singaporean workers for service jobs in general - to know how to serve, to want to serve and to go the extra mile for good service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not just about the IRs, it is about all our service industries: tourism, retail, food and beverage, finance, and healthcare.&nbsp; Service quality matters.&nbsp; Even in community centres (CCs), service quality matters - the PA (People's Association) staff running our CCs must provide five-star quality service.&nbsp; It is an outfit which is for the mass market, but the quality of service must be first class.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That is critical to Singapore's future, to our ability to earn a living in a competitive world, and it is a national challenge.&nbsp; That is why I got Minister Raymond Lim to spearhead the GEMS Movement, Go-the-Extra-Mile-for-Service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;GEMS has created a buzz.&nbsp; A lot of people have written to Mr Raymond Lim to ask to join the movement and we have involved many private sector executives, businessmen, and entrepreneurs in this effort.&nbsp; They have started initiatives, TV and publicity ads to promote great service, training programmes and leadership seminars.&nbsp; They have got service indicators to benchmark our service level with other countries, \"Thank You\" cards which customers are supposed to give to the service provider to show appreciation - to show that the good service has been noticed and has been recognised with appreciation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think we are beginning to see a difference.&nbsp; The employers are showing more commitment to service excellence.&nbsp; Metro has reported a doubling of compliments for the staff and a 20% reduction in complaints since it participated in the Customer Centric Initiative.&nbsp; The senior counter manager for Estee Lauder at Metro, Ms Joanne Liu, was interviewed by CNA and she explained why.&nbsp; She said: \"For example, when customers came back for goods exchange before, we were unwilling to do it. But now, we accept the changes and we do it on the spot willingly\".&nbsp; It is a mindset change.&nbsp; The Government is fully behind this movement.&nbsp; We are allocating $63 million to support this movement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fundamentally, what we are trying to do is to achieve a change in behaviour, in social norms, and make Singaporeans focus on courtesy and graciousness.&nbsp; We want to transform our society into one where people who serve do so willingly and with passion, and people who are served show respect and appreciation for those who serve them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not going to happen overnight.&nbsp; It will take time.&nbsp; We have to start in the schools, practise in the community and transform the workplace.&nbsp; But we can do it.&nbsp; Over the years, we have changed many aspects of Singaporeans' behaviour - no spitting, no littering, no messing up public toilets, speak English more properly, (that, we are still trying), accept other races and religions, keep fit and so on.&nbsp; So, many efforts, but cumulatively they have made a difference.&nbsp; Singaporeans today - I do not say we are beautiful Singaporeans, but less ugly than we used to be.&nbsp; We must continue to make an effort to be less ugly, not just in Singapore, but when we go overseas.&nbsp; I think the changes with GEMS are within our reach, because deep within each one of us is a desire to be appreciated and to be respected.&nbsp; What we need to do is to develop the habit of putting ourselves in the other person's shoes and 'do unto others as we would like others to do unto us'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Investing in R&amp;D, becoming a knowledge hub</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, investing in R&amp;D and becoming a knowledge hub.&nbsp; This Budget underscores the Government's commitment to invest in R&amp;D and to become a knowledge hub.&nbsp; We will inject $5 billion into an R&amp;D Trust Fund over the next five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R&amp;D is about experimentation, taking risks, venturing into uncharted territories - some failures, others successes.&nbsp; It means that we must be ready to support good people, to support good projects, to be hard-headed about what we do with our money, where we spend it, and in assessing whether projects are getting somewhere or whether we are getting nowhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have to be patient.&nbsp; We cannot expect results overnight.&nbsp; We have to spend some time.&nbsp; So, I am heartened that MPs like Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Ong Chit Chung, and Dr Loo Choon Yong support this effort to secure our long term economic future and have offered many good suggestions which we will follow up on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prof. Ivan Png has cautioned against being overly driven by a target like raising national expenditure on R&amp;D to 3% of the GDP, which he points out is an input target rather than an output target.&nbsp; His point is well-taken.&nbsp; I fully agree with him that what counts is output, not input, and we must get the appropriate performance measures, because how you measure influences what people will do.&nbsp; But, we do need inputs to get the desired outputs. If you look at countries like Sweden, Finland, US, Japan and Korea, they have shown that high levels of R&amp;D investments are strongly correlated with the level of innovation there - in terms of the high-tech start-ups, new products and processes, patents and finally, dynamism and prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we do need the money.&nbsp; We will not spend it blindly.&nbsp; We must make sure it is well spent.&nbsp; This means we must have robust processes to review and evaluate R&amp;D proposals, using local and foreign experts to help us.&nbsp; We must focus on building up core R&amp;D capabilities and talent, and not just on funding projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The National Research Foundation (NRF) and the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC), which I chair, have been formed to drive this overall effort.&nbsp; I am glad to tell Members that eminent academics and leading corporate figures have agreed to serve on the RIEC and on the Scientific Advisory Board of the NRF.&nbsp; These include Dr Susan Hockfield, who is President of MIT, Professor Clayton Christensen from the Harvard Business School, Dr Thomas Connelly, Chief Science and Technology Officer at Dupont, and Kenji Fujiyoshi, President of Mitsui Chemicals.&nbsp; They are experienced, very capable people.&nbsp; They know we are taking it seriously, and their participation shows that they have confidence in what we are doing.&nbsp; They will advise us on key areas of development and on how to assess and direct funding for R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has recommended a higher private share in total R&amp;D spending. I agree with him that greater private sector participation in R&amp;D is our long-term goal.&nbsp; But to get there, the Government's approach is to use public sector investments to drive, and to seed, private sector investment.&nbsp; We will not just fund projects but we will also encourage collaboration between the wider research community, including the research institutes, universities and the private sector.&nbsp; We are one small country.&nbsp; We cannot have factions and different warring territories in Singapore.&nbsp; We have to bring everybody together and make the most of a national effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr John Chen and Mr Ahmad Magad have suggested that funds should focus on supporting commercialisation of R&amp;D.&nbsp; Indeed, economic payoff is the ultimate objective.&nbsp; By commercialising technologies and ideas developed in the universities, research institutes and&nbsp;firms, we will be able to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But we have to be prepared to invest in the whole continuum of R&amp;D in a balanced sort of way, from upstream research to commercial application.&nbsp; We used to focus just on the very downstream development part.&nbsp; If we want to make further progress, we have to move upstream. But we have to do it in a focused sort of way, in fields where we believe there is a reasonable chance of a good outcome over the medium term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We used to focus on capability building in our first efforts in developing R&amp;D.&nbsp; Now, we are moving into creating new knowledge and commercialising the applications.&nbsp; EDB is already getting companies to set up the R&amp;D centres here, with A*STAR focusing on applied research. EDB and SPRING have a programme called SEEDS, Start-up Enterprise Development Scheme, which also helps to provide equity financing for creative individuals who want to commercialise their business models or products.&nbsp; So far, eleven of them have achieved the million dollar mark and six have won international awards for their products.&nbsp; So, not too bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have plans to help existing SMEs develop and commercialise creative ideas too, through the Enterprise Technology Fund.&nbsp; The details of how we will help SMEs to participate will be in the Committee of Supply for MTI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay expressed concern that R&amp;D could be dominated by foreigners and that Singaporeans will not benefit from it.&nbsp; I think we should look at it positively.&nbsp; We want to develop Singaporeans to go into R&amp;D - to become researchers and scientists - but we must get as many foreigners as we can to come here, do good work here, and help us to get the activities moving&nbsp;- better for them to be working with us rather than against us elsewhere.&nbsp; Only by attracting the best talent, foreign or local, can the quality of our R&amp;D be truly world-class.&nbsp; There is no centre in the world which only works with local talent and is world-class.&nbsp; You can go to the Whitehead Institute in MIT, you can go to Weizmann in Israel, you can go to Cambridge, Cavendish Labs - all the world-class institutions gather talent from around the world.&nbsp; No single country, not even the US, not even China, has enough talent and scientists to say: \"This is my own national effort - foreigners stay away.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The way to do it is to bring everybody in, the talent from wherever you can get them, to cross fertilise, spark off and germinate new ideas.&nbsp; At the same time, we will encourage locals to pursue a career in R&amp;D - get bright people into R&amp;D.&nbsp; We are always enhancing our programmes to grow our local scientists, but we need to find the talent with the potential and interests to do R&amp;D.&nbsp; Not everybody can do it, not even every bright person can do it.&nbsp; You have to have the right mindset to focus, to understand the subject in detail, and to spend a large part of your life researching in-depth in something which may lead to nothing, but which you hope will lead to something big.&nbsp; There are only a finite number of such people in Singapore.&nbsp; So where we can find them, we will deploy them to R&amp;D, remembering that you also need SAF officers, civil servants, MPs, businessmen, entrepreneurs and many other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Supporting entrepreneurship and enterprise</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, this Budget builds on initiatives taken over the last several years to support entrepreneurship, enterprise and businesses.&nbsp; Of course, in every Budget Debate, there are speeches that not enough has been done for SMEs.&nbsp; But, as with every Budget Debate Round-up Speech, let me try to put this issue in perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Help for SMEs</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Lawrence Leow and Dr Wang Kai Yuen spoke about the lack of assistance for local enterprises and SMEs. We have to see this Budget not in isolation, but as one of a series. Supporting entrepreneurship and enterprise has always been a key pillar in our efforts to reinvent ourselves.&nbsp; In recent years, we have taken several major initiatives, many of which confer significant benefits to SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have reduced taxes. We have introduced numerous tax measures that will help SMEs.&nbsp; Our tax burden is already low for start-ups and small companies. In fact, for the first three years, you do not pay tax at all. The tax system provides for cyclical swings in business and in earnings, because you have one year loss carry-back which I introduced last year.&nbsp; If you make a profit this year and next year you make a loss, you can actually go to IRAS and claim back some of the tax you paid the previous year and even out your tax burden - in fact, lighten your tax burden.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have also reduced our regulatory burden. There is an online business-licensing scheme to streamline licensing processes and cut business costs. This year, we are reducing record-keeping requirements for 17 statutes, which I believe has been welcomed by members, and which will be particularly helpful to small companies with not a lot of space, not a lot of staff, and not a lot of money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have also introduced many schemes to help local companies upgrade and expand overseas.&nbsp; In fact over the last five years, 9,000 SMEs have benefited from the Local Enterprises Technical Assistance Scheme, LETAS, to help them upgrade their capabilities, and 12,500 SMEs have obtained $3 billion of Government-facilitated loans. $3 billion - it is bigger than the Progress Package. It is quite a substantial amount. It has gone to a lot of SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are many, many schemes - too many for me to list here. But I went to the EnterpriseOne Portal yesterday, and I looked at the web pages on Government schemes for SMEs. If you print them out, it will be 10 pages, over 60 schemes - from tax incentives to grants and non-financial assistance measures. We do not lack schemes. Members have the handout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What we need to do is help the SMEs take full advantage of schemes already there, so that they can be guided through this forest of assistance in order to get what they need and what will make a difference for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But nevertheless, I invite the members to look at these 10 pages.&nbsp; Let me know if you have other ideas, or if you think these ideas can be simplified or improved. We will keep on improving our package and, if need be, add to these web pages, so long as it makes our assistance more effective and does not increase confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I know that SPRING feels a mission to help SMEs.&nbsp; This is not just a business, and those are not just clients.&nbsp; They feel that this is something which is worth doing, which they believe in, and that there is promise and hope - something worth promoting.&nbsp; They are going at it 'heart and soul' and the Government is behind them.&nbsp; We are happy to consider new ideas to help SMEs succeed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our philosophy is that if SMEs have good potential for growth and for success, we should encourage and help them in all the ways which are possible.&nbsp; But if SMEs are non-viable, then we should not artificially prop them up because that will just extend their pain and misery.&nbsp; It would not do a real favour to their owners and to the employees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Chay Wai Chuen raised the question of incentives like the Global Trader Programme and the Warehouse Retail Scheme, which they felt were biased towards foreign companies and multi-nationals. This is not true. As a principle, our incentives are focused on promoting desired activities and influencing where companies decide to locate, be they Singaporean companies or foreign companies. The incentives are not biased or structured in terms of ownership.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the case of the Global Trader Programme, it is aimed at making Singapore a global trading hub. It targets all companies that commit to conducting substantial offshore trading activities, and to carry out business activities which will result in spin offs to our local economy. It really does not matter whether these are local or foreign companies. As a matter of fact, there are some local traders which are enjoying this incentive, such as Petra Foods and Agritrade; maybe not as many as we would like, but it is open to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the case of the Warehouse Retail Scheme, this is designed to encourage companies, whether local or foreign, to establish their regional activities in Singapore.&nbsp; The requirement for this scheme is that 60% of the gross floor area must remain industrial but the balance can be used for retail.&nbsp; But when it is designated for retail, the user is charged full retail rates, comparable to retail rates in the vicinity.&nbsp; It should not put retail businesses nearby at an unfair disadvantage or at risk from large firms which are enjoying concessionary rents.&nbsp; It will increase the supply of retail shop space - that is true - but that is supply and demand, and I think, overall, that is good for the customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Pro-enterprise Government</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed have suggested that public agencies need to be more pro-enterprise. For example, they suggested that some small businesses should be allowed to operate at void decks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We have relaxed rules for small businesses. We used to be very stringent and some of the regulations were overly restrictive. We review and update them on an ongoing basis. For example, we now allow small businesses like car cleaning and mobile ice cream kiosks in HDB car parks, provided they do not affect the parking needs of residents, they do not create nuisance to the residents, or compromise the safety of car park users. We have also liberalised street hawking so vendors can sell food like ice cream, which does not perish so easily, in housing estates and car parks. Last year, we included newspapers and costume jewellery because, in the downturn, we felt this is one way people would be able to make a little bit of money for themselves and tide over their family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But many of the conditions and rules are there for some reason, and we cannot remove rules which are necessary for public safety or for the living environment. HDB has drawn the line on using void decks for commercial activities. I think we have to be fair to the people who live upstairs, especially on the second floor, and we have to preserve the residential character of the housing blocks. I would be careful about having char kway teow or something like that; the more fragrant it is, the bigger the problem upstairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But it does not mean that rules will never be changed. The position is continually open and we will review our rules as business needs change, and as views evolve on what the public considers acceptable, in terms of level of safety, convenience and public order.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, I encourage Members to keep on raising the subject and pushing the boundaries. With this dynamic tension, from what you think will be good and what we feel we can do, we will be able to become more pro-enterprise. I hope that in the process, Members will be able to understand what are the constraints and real problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked us to be patient before asking about results from the entrepreneurship promotion efforts. I also ask that he and other Members be equally patient because it will take time for the pro-enterprise mindset to become entrenched. But, we have success stories and we have outcomes which we can be proud of. For example, there is a home-grown sheet metal fabricator and machining company called Eng Tic Lee Achieve, which acquired new capabilities and became the first company in Southeast Asia to manufacture pharmaceutical packaging machines in partnership with a leading German equipment manufacturer. Many others have also made their mark in the region in China, in India, and also now in new markets in the Middle East. As we continue with efforts to improve entrepreneurship, I am confident we will have many more success stories to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>GLCs</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Still on local enterprises, Mr Inderjit Singh has asked about efforts by Temasek companies to become globalised Singapore enterprises, as recommended by the ERC. Our companies have expanded overseas over the years, but these are decisions which the companies have to make - with their boards and their managements. The Government cannot dictate the pace of expansion for individual companies. In fact, Inderjit also reminded us that we should not get involved in dictating things for these companies.&nbsp; In the long term, Temasek's aim is to reduce exposure in Singapore from half, which it presently is, to about one-third. The companies are moving.&nbsp; Sometimes, we give them an encouraging nudge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Minister Mentor (MM) once in a while gives a very encouraging nudge. Members will have read that he has been talking to SIA and its management and unions. Mr Inderjit Singh raised an eyebrow and suggested that we have failed to observe the ERC's recommendation to ensure that GLCs are commercially-run without interference by the Government.&nbsp; I think without interference does not mean without encouragement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MM's involvement has been chiefly in resolving the labour relations situation in SIA. It reflects his long association with the tripartite process and his standing as a trusted and well-intentioned neutral party by all the players. It is also driven by the Government's larger strategic interest to safeguard our status as an air hub and to help SIA restructure to face a new landscape while it is still doing well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So MM's comments to SIA that it needs to consider trimming its businesses was not a directive. The specific restructuring and adjustment to deal with the future will have to be decided by SIA management and its board, based on what makes commercial sense. But sometimes it is helpful to paint a broader picture of the industry trends and state clearly where the Government sees a strategic national advantage - in this case, in being an air hub rather than keeping out competition in order to protect Singapore Airlines; so that managements and unions recognise that tough changes are necessary. As Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out, the comments may have preceded an upward tick in the SIA stock price. So maybe the market took it positively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Maintaining a competitive tax environment</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, on maintaining a competitive tax environment, Prof. Ivan Png has suggested minimising tax incentives and moving towards a simple tax system with a low headline tax rate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is an ideal which I sympathise with, but unfortunately, reality is not so simple.&nbsp; The basic problem is this.&nbsp; We want the best companies in the world to come and locate here - offer the best technology, best jobs, best markets - but these best companies are in demand everywhere. Other governments are courting them. Even the developed countries are courting them. America, Japan, Europe - they offer lucrative incentives to selectively anchor key businesses and investments. Sometimes, they give outright cash grants per job created - one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand Euros because every job created is one fewer job on the unemployment rolls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, if we want them to come here and we say you pay the same here as everybody else in Singapore - 20% corporate tax - we cannot get them. We are out of the running. They come to see us and they show us; they say this is best of breed. Best of breed - they 'shop' for the best incentives from different governments - investment allowances, tax holidays, grants, training assistance schemes and so on. Assemble one page 'best of breed' and they tell us: please match this and then we will think about whether to put you into the running.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if we need them, we have to make an offer which they will consider, but one which leaves us above zero. Not ending with a net negative but above zero. If they come, we get the economic spin-offs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, if we say we give the same favourable tax rates, flat tax rate, to other companies that we give to the best, most desirable project which we want to anchor here, the Government will get very little revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So we have to retain tax incentives to attract and retain strategic businesses and activities. At the same time, we have to ensure that our incentives are granted fairly and objectively - that the companies must meet our criteria and deliver specific net benefits to our economy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, our formula has served us well. Quite a low headline rate to support enterprise, plus targeted incentives, usually with clear sunset clauses, to promote strategic investments. But we try to keep our tax code clean - we do not encumber it with many special perks and loopholes as happens in other countries, because we would like to keep the playing field as level as possible, subject to this constraint - that there are companies, which we need, whom we cannot charge the full rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><B><I>Maintaining fiscal prudence</I></B></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Even as this Budget invests in key areas of growth and shares the fruit we have reaped with Singaporeans, it maintains our core principles of fiscal prudence and sustainability over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Keeping Government lean and trim</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As I said in the Budget Statement, our major taxes are at about the right levels. On the other hand, there will be new spending needs in healthcare, education, training and R&amp;D which will put pressure on our finances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, we have to keep the Government lean and trim to manage these new spending priorities. Over the years, we have introduced various initiatives to help do this. To drive discipline, we have the Manpower Management Framework (MMF), the headcount freeze and other schemes. To get value for money, we have best sourcing, demand aggregation, the Centre for Shared Services and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong has raised concerns that cost-cutting efforts such as the Manpower Management Framework should not come at the cost of poorer service levels, or worse still, drive agencies to outsource services at an increased cost to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are mindful of these concerns. The MMF aims to achieve headcount reductions through productivity improvements, job redesign or by re-prioritising functions. Where there is additional manpower required, the framework is responsive to the circumstances of the Ministries. For example, for the Budget Terminal at Changi - it is a new service. We are providing additional manpower headcount. Or, because the IR is coming, MHA needs to set up a Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore - we are studying how we can increase MHA's baseline in order to account for this new function so that there will be appropriate manpower recruited for this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Best sourcing results in outsourcing only if the private sector can do the task more cost-effectively and, therefore, cannot be the cause of increased fees. Since we launched Best Sourcing in February 2003, we have market-tested 218 functions. We have outsourced 59% of them. The annual operational cost savings is S$25 million or 25% of in-house costs. Still quite small, but I think there is further potential. Outsourcing has resulted in direct savings for the public. For example, the Ministry of Finance itself has reduced the fees charged to suppliers for registering as Government suppliers by at least 10% as a result of outsourcing this service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdm Halimah has raised concerns that MMF should not inhibit public sector agencies from employing older workers and she has warned that best sourcing should not simply become \"cheap-sourcing\", because private companies may cut back on staff welfare and benefits to win jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The public sector's approach is that we employ the candidate who best fits the job requirements regardless of age, sex or race.&nbsp; But when we outsource, we outsource to reliable vendors - we should not assume that outsourcing achieves lower costs simply by having the vendors cut the workers' salaries. There will be, in some cases, specialised private sector providers which offer lower costs simply because the business which is best sourced to them is their primary business. So, they can achieve greater economies of scale and innovation. Also, I would say that we want to outsource to a reliable company, not one which submits a ridiculously low bid and then is unable to meet its obligations or pay its workers and then runs into trouble halfway, leaving the Government to pick up the pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mdm Halimah has suggested that the Government considers stipulating in outsourcing contracts that providers must comply with labour laws and pay the employees decent wages on time. I recognise this concern and there have been some cases which have run into problems. But, the solution lies in enforcing the labour laws. I do not think a contract obligation stipulated by the Government as the buyer of the contract will solve this problem, because really it is a legal obligation that the vendor pays its workers, pays the CPF, meets all the legal rules which he has to meet. Anybody who does business with the Government, or with anybody else, is expected to do that. If they do not, there will be penalties. From time to time, employees complained that they have not been given their pay. In such cases, if they have missed out on the rightful employment benefits, they should seek the union's advice or they should approach MOM for help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically on the change on headcount arising from the MMF, Mr Chay Wai Chuen has questioned the apparent increase in the public service headcount despite the MMF. May I clarify that the increase which he saw in manpower in the FY2006 Budget - 1.6% increase in the headcount - is actually an increase in the establishment posts and not the actual headcount, because often the establishment posts are left unchanged for some time while agencies work out how to cope with fewer personnel by, for example, streamlining or modifying processes when they have natural attrition, resignations and retirements. On the other hand, when agencies undertake new functions, they introduce additional posts. So, overall headcount numbers have come down although the establishments have not yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Funding this Budget</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, let me talk about one very important issue which MPs have raised, and that is, funding this budget. Several MPs, including Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Chew Heng Ching, have asked if this Budget's stance diverges from our principle of fiscal prudence and our longer-term sustainability. And Mr Ong Kian Min had asked if we should have been more tight-fisted and withheld some of the generous cash give-aways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is good that Members are looking beyond this Budget to these issues of long-term growth and fiscal sustainability. But let me assure Members that this Budget will not strain our long-term fiscal position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, the size of the Progress Package, $2.6 billion, is not large compared to that of the New Singapore Shares which was $2.5 billion and Economic Restructuring Shares which was $2.7 billion. So it does not imply unprecedented generosity as&nbsp; mentioned by Dr Amy Khor. However, because we have become more targeted in our approach, older, lower-income households can expect to receive more this time and the impact on them will be more significant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, our Progress Package is not a permanent programme. It is once-off.&nbsp; We are not promising this every year or every five years or every so many years. It is once-off, needed this time because we are restructuring, because the economy has turned good, and yet we know that there are some segments of the population needing help. So, a Progress Package is justified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, our transfers to the Endowment Funds, which Prof. Ivan Png mentioned, are accounted for conservatively. Prof. Png suggested that the Overall Budget Position should be calculated based on actual expenditures rather than the total transfers to these funds. This is a plausible accounting treatment, but we have chosen a more conservative approach in line with our principle of fiscal prudence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Going forward, our fiscal position is sustainable. In this term, it has been tighter than we expected and tighter than before. Several reasons - because there was a slow economy in 2002 and 2003 and we have had two major packages. First, we provided the ERS (to offset the GST increase) which was $2.7 billion. Later on, we deferred part of the GST increase, staggering it, first 3% to 4%, then 4% to 5% - the deferral cost $600 million-$700 million. It is big money. And now, we are having this Progress Package.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Going forward, we are not likely to have the same combination of events. Nevertheless, the position will be fairly tight and we must continue to be vigilant and focused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There seems to be some confusion about how we will fund the Special Transfers of $3.59 billion for FY2006, judging from the media and analysts' reports on the Budget, and also from what has been said in this House.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As I stated in the Budget Statement, we have some funds which accrued to the current Government when it took office in 2001, as well as some capital receipts from our statutory boards during the term of this Government. We do not reflect these capital receipts in the overall budget position because despite what Mr Steve Chia said, they are irregular, lumpy and uncertain sources of funds. Over the last&nbsp;10 years, these capital receipts have fluctuated between $30 million at the lowest to a few billion dollars at the highest. If we had included them, it would have overstated the amount of regular revenue we have on a year-to-year basis with which to fund our regular expenditures. But these capital receipts remain available to the Government to spend within its term, without drawing on past reserves. Taking them together with the funds from the changeover of year 2001, we have enough to pay for the Special Transfers without drawing on past reserves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me just go through some of the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We started off the current term in 2001 with $2.51 billion of funds accruing to the incoming government. The amount was computed because it was a changeover year, and it was computed in accordance with the Apportionment Rules between the outgoing and the incoming government as laid out in the White Paper on the protection of reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Government also received $2.45 billion over FY2002 till FY2005 in capital receipts from statutory boards which were returning capital in excess of their needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, if you total up the budget surpluses and deficits between FY2002 and FY2006, including $3.59 billion of Special Transfers in 2006, the net cumulative Overall Budget Deficit is $4.23 billion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, just taking the $2.51 billion that the current government got in FY2001 plus the $2.45 billion in capital receipts from statutory boards - that adds up to $4.96 billion - we can comfortably fund the $4.23 billion net cumulative Overall Budget Deficit from FY2002 to FY2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, we have enough funds with some left over. But let us not exaggerate. <I>Today</I> reported on&nbsp;24th February that the Government is able to draw on capital receipts from statutory boards in the current term and such receipts raked in $13.42 billion between the fiscal years 2002 and 2005. Mr Steve Chia yesterday further inflated this figure to $19 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Steve Chia says that he is misled and that the people are misled by the Government. But actually it is Mr Steve Chia who is misleading all of us because these numbers are all incorrect. We do not have $13.42 billion of capital receipts to draw on as reported by <I>Today</I>, let alone $19 billion as claimed by Mr Steve Chia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me explain. <I>Today</I>'s main error is to treat capital receipts from the sale of Government land as money we can spend. These land sales add up to more $10 billion, but they are locked up, as past reserves, and cannot be touched because this is not new money.&nbsp; It is not earned, it is not capital gains, it is just transformation of a piece of land into cash, transformation of one asset into the other. The land has been locked up, so the cash proceeds are also locked up. This was <I>Today</I>'s mistake. Mr Steve Chia also made this mistake but I believe he must have made some other mistakes in order to reach such a huge number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Fiscal sustainability</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why it is okay for the Government to incur a deficit of $2.9 billion and yet when the opposition suggests increasing expenditure on education and healthcare, we say it is fiscally irresponsible - which it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason is that the Workers' Party proposes to spend regardless of whether we can afford it on a sustained basis. To quote the Workers' Party Manifesto, it talks about \"an unconditional needs-based welfare safety net\". In contrast, this Government lives within its means without neglecting its obligations to lower-income Singaporeans. Regular expenditures are funded by regular revenues and not irregular capital receipts. I had explained earlier that the Progress Package does not draw on past reserves and will not impose an ongoing fiscal burden on taxpayers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Steve Chia's speech yesterday shows vividly where the Opposition's approach will lead. He wants to raid the bank. He proposed cutting all sorts of taxes and fees; just declare that Christmas has arrived. Or as <I>Zaobao</I> says \"<I>zuo chi shan kong</I>\" (sit and eat until the mountain is empty); it is precisely this kind of free spending which the Constitution and the Elected President have been designed to prevent. The safeguard ensures that our past reserves are protected and politicians will not make free with them in order to win popularity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the Workers' Party advocates that we abolish the Elected Presidency and remove the Second Key. That is why I believe that the Opposition's approach and the Workers' Party's approach is fiscally irresponsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang's memory also seems to have been selective. He claims we are not spending enough for Singaporeans who need help.&nbsp; But, he has forgotten. During downturns, we have provided assistance to Singaporeans who have difficulties coping. Mr Low said that after giving out the New Singapore Shares and holding elections in 2001, we pushed up the GST rate. Yes, we did. But what we also did, which he forgot to mention is that before we raised the GST, we provided $2.7 billion worth of Economic Restructuring Shares to help Singaporeans cope. So the GST was completely buffered by the Economic Restructuring Shares, and the New Singapore Shares is a completely different package, a clean benefit which all Singaporeans enjoy. So to say that the New Singapore Shares resulted in the GST after the elections is as they say in Latin \"<I>suppressio veri suggestio falsi</I>\" (by suppressing the truth you suggest a falsehood).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Low also said we have not done enough to help the poor on a consistent basis, and our help is only once in five years. Since 2001, this Government has spent about $7.8 billion in total for a variety of assistance measures not counting this Progress Package. This includes the New Singapore Shares in 2001, the ERS from 2002 to 2004, the CPF Top-Ups from 2004 to 2006, U-Save, Service and Conservancy Charges and Rental Rebates, and so on. A typical low-income household would have received more than $11,000 in total from all these schemes. This, not counting the Progress Package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Low has had nothing to say about the substance of the Progress Package, unlike, for example, Mr Chiam See Tong, who has gone through and has pointed out some issues with implementation, particularly with the Workfare Bonus. Indeed, Mr Low had nothing to say about his alternative propositions as to how the Workers' Party proposes to take Singapore forward and to help low-income Singaporeans - nothing. It only shows that he is really not interested in whether Singaporeans are getting the help they need. He is only interested in scoring political points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The underlying principle that must continue to guide this Government is fiscal prudence. Every term of the Government must live within its means and the Budget must be in overall balance over the economic cycle, and that is what guides this Government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I><B>Moving forward together</B></I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Economic growth is a basic pre-condition to raise living standards across the board.&nbsp; But incomes will get stretched out as we restructure the economy and as globalisation hits us.&nbsp; Older workers and lower-income groups will face particular difficulties. So we have to augment our broad-based approach with more targeted help. Deliver the fruits of growth to every citizen, especially the older workers and lower-income groups who need the most help.&nbsp; Ensure that nobody is left behind and left out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, we have to provide the help in a way that encourages recipients to make the effort to work, not to free-ride on state support, to target the areas where the needs are greatest, to involve the community and the grassroots network and leaders, and to maintain fiscal discipline and responsibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Workfare, not welfare</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The key principle was set out by Ng Eng Hen's Committee on Low Wage Workers - Workfare, not welfare. Because, the best way to help people is to help them re-train and find work, so that they can take care of themselves and their families. This is something which many MPs have said in different ways over the last few days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Long-term measures to help workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked whether we can find sufficient jobs for all those willing and able to work. There are many jobs. Last year alone, we created 111,000 jobs. Job vacancies in the private sector, just in establishments with at least 25 employees, rose to a four-and-a-half year high of 20,000 in September 2005. But, many of the jobs created are at the higher end. Nearly half the job vacancies require at least an upper-secondary qualification, which is not surprising because this reflects our economic restructuring. So, while there are jobs available, the workers who are unemployed will need the skills and qualifications in order to take up these jobs. That is why we have many initiatives like the Workforce Skills Qualifications System to help them to do so. At the same time, NTUC is working with WDA to step up the Job Re-creation Programme and to re-create 10,000 jobs a year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr John Chen and Mr Zainudin Nordin talked about the need for systematic and sustained measures and also asked whether we could make the Workfare Bonus permanent to help the lower-income and unemployed in the longer term. I agree that sustained measures are needed. Indeed, most of the key Workfare measures are permanent and address structural issues. We are providing more social support for low-income families so that parents can go out to work.&nbsp; We are expanding job opportunities through job redesign and equipping individuals with higher skills for better jobs. WDA is expecting to spend a lot of money - $140 million per year over the next three years on training and re-creating jobs, and we are investing heavily in education. I agree completely with MPs - Dr Lily Neo, Mr Arthur Fong, Mr Ong Ah Heng, Ms Eunice Olsen - who said that it is important to concentrate on children of lower-income families so that they can, in turn, help to lift their families out of poverty. We have a comprehensive approach that includes early intervention, making sure that education is affordable to all, reducing school dropout rates and strengthening vocational training pathways. The Opportunity Funds support our commitment to help these children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Financial support for workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two key financial measures to encourage work. One is the additional CPF Housing Grant, and the other is the Workfare Bonus. The additional CPF Housing Grant is a permanent scheme, consistent with our policy of helping Singaporeans to be homeowners. It will help provide lower-income HDB first-timers with a significant sum for buyers to own their homes - a significant sum over and above the subsidy which all HDB buyers already enjoy. $20,000 is equivalent to 20% of the selling price of a three-room flat, and an even bigger proportion of the selling price of the two-room flats which HDB will be building.&nbsp; So, we have made one very big move on the additional CPF housing grant, which is permanent, and which is targeted at the lower-income groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Workfare Bonus marks a significant step because it provides low-wage workers with a cash bonus. If you work, you get the cash bonus at the end of the year, twice - this year based on 2005 work, next year based on 2006 work. It is a once-off scheme because this is the first time we are doing it. Payments will be for two years. We should experiment and gain experience with the scheme first, before considering whether we need a more permanent work-based assistance scheme like this, and if so, what form it should take.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With once-off schemes, we can afford to make mistakes. But with a permanent scheme, mistakes will be much harder to reverse and we have to be mindful of unintended consequences. Will a scheme like this cause employers to push wages down permanently?&nbsp; Will it reduce the incentive to upgrade to a higher paying job? How do we deal with a problem, which Mr Chiam talked about, where somebody works hard, goes from $1,200 to $2,500 doing overtime and then, as a result, falls out of the net and does not qualify? To some extent, that is unavoidable but how steeply do you want the bonus to tail off with income so that for each extra dollar of work, it is still worth your while to go for that extra dollar? This is the sort of problem we have to watch out for and study.&nbsp; How complex will the Workfare scheme be to administer? How do we prevent people from over-claiming? Nobody over-declares when you pay income tax but when you claim negative income tax, over-declaration can be a significant problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But, however this Workfare idea evolves, we must never allow it to expand into a permanent needs-based welfare scheme that is not conditional on work. Because that is the way to financial ruin and worse still, as many MPs have pointed out&nbsp;- Dr Amy Khor, Dr Chong Weng Chiew, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Dr Tan Boon Wan - it will breed a crutch mentality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Alternative suggestions for helping vulnerable workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some have suggested a few other ways to help vulnerable workers. One is to have tax incentives for companies to hire older workers. It is possible but I am not in favour.&nbsp; I will tell you why. A tax incentive is, in principle, no different from a Workfare Bonus which is paid directly to the workers, except for this - it goes through the company and the company has to make a profit before it can take advantage of the tax incentive. I would rather pay this directly to the worker. Also, if I make a tax incentive which extends to all older workers and not just the older lower-income workers, then there will be a lot of deadweight loss because I will be granting tax exemption on many people who really do not need the tax incentive. It is more straightforward to give a direct grant to workers, like through this bonus. In fact, that is how other countries which have earned income incentives do it - direct payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested providing more retrenchment protection through increasing compulsory CPF savings or having a national unemployment insurance scheme. It is also one of the items in the Workers' Party manifesto. The same question applies to both - which is, who is to pay for this protection? Who is to pay for this unemployment insurance? If you raise employee contributions to CPF, then you reduce workers' take home pay. Are you prepared to do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you raise employer contributions, then you are going to increase business costs and lower competitiveness. In fact, since the ERC recommendations, we have been working hard to adjust the CPF contribution rate to be at a sustainable level to lower cost and yet have enough for retirement requirements, for housing requirements, and for medical requirements. Quite a number of MPs, including Ms Penny Low and others, have pointed out that we must make sure that we have enough money for retirement. Every additional item you take out of the CPF means $1 less from somewhere, from retirement needs or from housing needs. You might say: Decide the principle, then we can figure out how to do it later on. But I think we have to look at the practicality and the practicality is: who is to pay for this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also in Singapore, most workers already have some form of retrenchment protection. MOM did a survey two years ago in 2004 - 96% of private sector establishments with at least 25 employees paid retrenchment benefits to their local employees who had at least three years of service. So there is already some kind of unemployment protection which is in the retrenchment benefits scheme. If you are going to introduce a new layer of unemployment insurance, is it going to be on top of retrenchment benefits or in lieu of retrenchment benefits? I think you have to consider carefully because if it is in lieu of retrenchment benefits, you have to take away a well-established scheme which is more or less working. We can improve it but it is a scheme which has worked out and people have accrued retrenchment benefit rights which are very important - as I am sure Mdm Halimah will confirm. If it is going to be on top of the present system, is it wise to have double provision for unemployment protection at additional cost and with additional negative side-effects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are these side-effects? <I>Straits Times</I> today had a timely article: \"How the next welfare state must work?\" It is an article from the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich and it is by the Director, Prof. Hans-Werner Sinn, who is an eminent economist. The research institute is a well-respected European, German, think-tank. They produce <I>Ifo Business Surveys</I> which track how the European economy is going. Their article today says how the next welfare state must work and what is wrong with the present welfare state.&nbsp; I read from the article: \"In Western Europe, the welfare state helps these people by paying replacement incomes in the form of social aid, unemployment benefits or early retirement benefits\".&nbsp; Unemployment benefits - so it gives you replacement income. In other words, if the market does not provide you with a sufficient income from your labour, the state will provide an income without requiring you to work - which is what unemployment insurance is about. He goes on to say: \"As humane as this policy is meant to be, it is largely responsible for the mass unemployment from which Europe suffers. The reason is simple - replacement incomes are wages for doing nothing.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then he goes on to explain this is an old problem but it is worse now because of China and India, and now wages have to adjust. So, another way European companies have tried to fix this is with a legal minimum wage, to prevent wages from falling. He explains why a legal minimum wage is also not a sensible approach. He says Europe's welfare system based on replacement incomes and minimum wages will not survive globalisation. Because, if you go for minimum wages, you are actually pricing yourself out of the market. You are encouraging other people to come in to work - to take the work away. You will not survive globalisation and there is no way to turn back the tide of history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So what does he propose? He proposes wage supplements, which means paying people to work - the way we are doing Workfare. He says even wage supplements is expensive, because you have to pay everybody - you have to pay all those who are working and not just those who are not working. But he thinks if you do the sums, it probably will be less expensive than going for unemployment benefits and minimum wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the most important thing is, whether we call it wage supplements or Workfare, we are encouraging people to work, we are encouraging people to take care of themselves, and we are ensuring that they have a reasonable standard of living. At the same time, we let the market do its work so the economy can restructure, can grow, and in time they will upgrade, retrain and be able to do better for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>The Progress Package</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Targeted approach</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, let me talk about the Progress Package. When there are budget surpluses, we have periodically shared the fruits of growth with Singaporeans and that is what the Progress Package does. But there is a key difference. With the Progress Package, we are taking a more targeted approach. There is more for the older workers and for the lower-income group most affected by economic restructuring. More for the elderly most worried about medical and retirement needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Some MPs like Ms Irene Ng, Prof. Ivan Png and Dr Ong Seh Hong have suggested we could have taken a more broad-based approach and provided more to the 'asset-rich, cash-poor' group, younger lower-wage workers in their 30s, housewives and so on. I recognise that these are all groups which have some claim. The Progress Package recognises the contributions of all Singaporeans. Every adult Singaporean will receive at least $200 of Growth Dividends and many Singaporeans will receive more. But, we have to set priorities to make the most of the package and to send a clear message on what our focus is. This Progress Package is weighted towards poorer Singaporeans and lower-income workers. For the Workfare Bonus, we have focused on the older lower-wage workers because they are more vulnerable in terms of employment, security of jobs, and their income. Our aim is to make sure that nobody is left behind when we restructure and upgrade the economy. I think the message has got through. The <I>New Paper</I> reported one housewife, Madam Kwan Yoke Kuan, who said that looking after the older lower-income group is more important.&nbsp; This, I think, sums up the sentiment of many Singaporeans. Over the past week, I have received many emails too from people who agree with the Budget's focus of targeting help for those who are lower-income and most in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I should also like to urge Members to look at this package not by itself but in the context of the many other things which the Government has done and the many other packages which we have introduced over the years. As I explained just now, we've spent more than $10 billion, including this Progress Package, since 2001 on various assistance measures. It is not possible to be absolutely fair to every group every time. I cannot do that unless I know in detail everybody's life, how the household is structured, what your finances are, and what your background circumstances are. But, we try to be roughly fair, and over time, with the range of packages, taking all our policies together, I think generally we have been fair to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Implementation of Progress Package - fair and simple</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now let me deal with some of the queries on the details of the Progress Package.&nbsp; First, do not be anxious about the need to sign up. Most Singaporeans only have to be patient and wait for the letters to come. The letters will tell you exactly how much you will be getting, then just sign up from 1st April if you want to receive it on 1st May. But even if you are a little bit late, we will keep the window open until the end of the year. Let us know whether you want us to credit your bank account or you want the cheque in the mail. There is no need to put in $50 in your CPF account this time, but in future we will think about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Only those who meet the age, income and housing criteria for the Workfare Bonus but do not have CPF contributions and have not received a tax return, they are the ones who should fill in a Workfare Bonus scheme income declaration form by 1st April. It is a serious declaration. It is an IRAS form. There are serious consequences if it is not properly filled.&nbsp; Please declare honestly what you have earned and we will work on that basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I also welcome Mr Chew Heng Ching's and Mdm Ho Geok Choo's suggestions that better-off Singaporeans may want to donate their Progress Package to others because they may not need the money. They can do so. We have arranged for this. When they sign up online, they can donate to a list of available charities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, the first thing is - do not worry, the administration is simple. Second, the conditions are simple and fair. Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Dr Warren Lee and some members of the public have asked why we have not used property ownership instead of place of residence for the Growth Dividends and CPF top ups, because you could be living in your parents' or relatives' home. I agree that the proxy of the residential address is not quite perfect, but generally speaking, those people living in higher-value homes will have more resources to call on even if they do not own the place they live in. If we tried to determine the person's exact wealth or the wealth of the household per capita, it will be complex and intrusive, and I think Singaporeans will resent that.&nbsp; If there is some inequity, or maybe a few people benefit more than they needed to, we have to take the rough with the smooth.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Workfare Bonus has the condition that one must work at least six continuous months in each year to qualify for the Workfare Bonus. Many MPs, including Mdm Halimah, have asked us to clarify this because sometimes a person may be unemployed for a short time, between jobs or some other reason, in spite of him making the effort to stay continuously employed. Over the past week, we have also heard from some low-wage Singaporeans. So, we have reviewed this and decided to be flexible. We will allow exceptions for those who have worked for at least half a year to also qualify for the bonus, even if their employment period had a break in it. Let me also clarify that it does not matter if you switch from full-time to part-time or contract work. What we ask for is that you work for six months - effort from individuals to work regularly and to help yourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There will be other unique circumstances which we have not anticipated, but it is not possible to have rules that cater to all of these. Otherwise, it will be a whole book. So, those with genuine cases can appeal to the grassroots advisers who will take up the matter with the CPF Board. We will continue to work through the mass media to inform all Singaporeans about the Progress Package, but we will pay special attention to those who need additional help to sign up. We will enlist the help of grassroots leaders to reach out to residents staying in one and two-room flats. We will also be working with the welfare and nursing homes, community hospitals and even prisons to help the residents get the Progress Package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I><B>Our approach is working</B></I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that overall, our approach of targeting help at the most needy and those willing to help themselves is working.

Last Friday, I went to DXO. It is a disco, but there was no music. This was just a Job Re-creation Programme Awards Night. Mr Lim Swee Say invited me. I gave awards, among other things, to 15 JRP participants, workers, and I spoke to them all after that. I was very impressed and moved by their commitment. One of them is Mr Arumugam s/o Ramalingam.&nbsp; He is 45. He had a business failure back in 1997, and he was declared bankrupt. He worked for a cleaning company for five years - he got retrenched in May 2004. But he did not lose hope. He did not give up. He took up a National Skills Recognition Scheme course in landscape maintenance. He became a landscaping technician. Starting pay, $1,150 just February last year. He did well. After four months, he got a raise to $1,300 and last December he was promoted to supervisory position. Now, he earns $1,500 a month and oversees the work of a four-man team at Marina City Park. So it is a small programme to assist the person, but it has helped him to make good in his life. The other recipients all had stories to tell and were proud of themselves, and I think that is the way we should help people. It shows us that as long as we believe in our workers, and people believe in themselves, it is possible for them to move up the job ladder, earn higher salaries, and live better lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the Progress Package, we will provide much needed help for the lower-income. So after I announced the Budget, the newspapers went and looked for specific cases to see how it affected people's lives. <I>Shin Min Daily</I> reported one odd job worker, Huang Qichang, who lives in a three-room flat with his wife and two daughters. The family will get Growth Dividends ($800 each husband and wife), Workfare Bonus for him ($600), NSmen's bonus for him (he had two daughters, so only for him, $400), U-Save rebate because three-room flat ($100); adds up to $2,700. He told the papers that he will use the money to pay off his outstanding bills. His daughters currently have to go to their classmates' houses to use computers to do their school assignments, so with money from the Progress Package, he is going to buy a study table and a new computer for his daughters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And there was another example in <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I>, a 32-year-old lady, Wang Suyan and her family. She earns $300-$400. She just works part-time as a coffee shop assistant. Husband is a factory technician, monthly income less than $1,500. So when asked how she would use her family's share of the Progress Package, she said she would save the money for the education of her two young children, aged five and six, as the road ahead is still long for them. So, not everybody is buying 4D. These are the stories which give you heart and hope, and convince me that we are doing the right thing for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately, we can only help Singaporeans if we can continue to grow the economy. Therefore this Budget also focuses on attracting investments to grow the economy, and to create jobs. The incentives and the measures we have put in place in this Budget and in previous years are beginning to bear fruit. We have seen good growth in a wide range of areas and let me just cite you a few.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In transport engineering, we have become the largest and most comprehensive centre in Asia for the provision of aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul services (MRO) - that means aeroplane engines being serviced and overhauled in Singapore. Our shipyards build 70% of the world's oil rigs and platforms and their order books are full for the next five years. We are competitive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In retail trade, wholesale and retail trade has been growing double digits in the last three years.&nbsp; I know HDB shops are still having some difficulty and MND has been helping to tackle some of their problems, but overall, the retail sales have been doing well and even provision and sundry shops in 2005 did better - went up by 8.6% compared to 2004.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In financial services and wealth management, we have had double-digit growth over the past five years - assets under management reaching $570 billion by end 2004. Each time I meet them, I ask them how well are you doing? They say \"Sshhh\", do not tell anybody, but they are doing alright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And so jobs have been created - 111,000 last year. If you look at university graduates, last year 92% got employed within six months of final examinations. Polytechnic students - 91% found jobs within six months of final examinations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So overall, I am confident we are on the right path. Our strategy of competitiveness and cohesion is the right approach for taking us into the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently Ministry of Finance and SMU organised a forum: \"If you were the Finance \"Minister\", where students developed and debated their own budget statements. We should practise this with MPs as well. The budget plan that was voted the most appropriate was entitled: \"Staying Ahead, Staying Together\". That is exactly what this budget is about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not read the plan. Perhaps my staff may have borrowed some ideas from it, but that is what this Budget is about:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) Staying ahead - building a vibrant economy where there is prosperity for the nation and good jobs for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) Staying together - forging an inclusive society, where every citizen benefits from the country's progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prof. Koo Tsai Kee is correct when he says this is a landmark year of profound change.&nbsp; While sharing the fruits of growth is something which the Government has periodically done, this Budget is different because it recognises that the world has changed and growth will no longer deliver the same opportunities to every individual. So going forward, we will work systematically to ensure that no Singaporean is left behind as we forge ahead. This Budget lays a foundation for a strong and prosperous Singapore. It offers a better life for all Singaporeans and that is our shared responsibility:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) Courage and commitment from every citizen - adapting, upgrading, and seizing new opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) Strong and competent leadership from the Government - focused on the long-term, in touch with the people and their needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min said some Singaporeans think Singapore has reached its peak and it is just downhill. I believe they are completely mistaken. We have scaled the peak of one mountain, actually we are not at the peak, we are on one mountain, and we are climbing up. We see a whole mountain range opening up in front of us. There is a whole range of possibilities ahead. We can choose which one to go to. We still have to climb, it will still require great effort, but with the skills and the strengths we have acquired climbing the first mountain, we are stronger and better placed to conquer the next higher peak and then the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So let us work to make Singapore our best home and together build a brighter future for all. [<I>Applause</I>.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> A clarification, Sir.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> A short one.

On unemployment insurance,&nbsp;I would like to clarify&nbsp;the reason why we contemplated and decided to propose this unemployment insurance.&nbsp; It is because of the experience of the financial crisis.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp;we have retrenchment benefits, but when the company closed down, the workers get nothing.&nbsp; Bearing in mind that there are a lot of workers who are not unionised, they are just&nbsp;retrenched and left with nothing. They can be drawing a few thousand dollars or a few hundred dollars but, suddenly, when they are retrenched, they must be left with nothing because the company just went bust. How do they cope with life with the sudden drastic change in income?&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation that we have, in terms of securing some kind of payment, when a person is retrenched, is not satisfactory.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> That is not&nbsp;a point of clarification.

Okay, never mind, Sir.&nbsp; I leave the matter.&nbsp; I do want to clarify some points made by the Prime Minister. First, on unconditional needs-based welfare scheme,&nbsp;he said it would bankrupt the Government.&nbsp; He criticised the Workers' Party for saying that the Government should provide unconditional needs-based help.&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification from the Prime Minister as to what form of help that is going to be.&nbsp; If it is not going to be unconditional needs-based, is it going to be adhoc or depending on budget surplus?&nbsp; What happens if there is no budget surplus? The people who need help will perhaps have to fend for themselves.&nbsp; I hope he would clarify that point.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is on fiscal prudence. First of all, I wish to thank the Finance Minister for his detailed explanation as to how the Budget is funded.&nbsp; I noted the funding is actually quite thin in the sense that you do not have very much left.&nbsp;

It is versus what we have been doing, where we have many helping hands.&nbsp; We have ComCare, S&amp;C, U-Save and Progress Package.&nbsp; We have many schemes to address problems according to their needs.&nbsp; But unconditional needs-based, that you will all be entitled, do not be afraid to put your hand out.&nbsp; This is something which should have been debated during the debate, when he made his speech, instead of scoring political points.&nbsp; Then we can discuss whether it is wise or unwise, how he raises it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;there will be further opportunities for him to do so, I assure him, before the General Election.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On Mr Steve Chia's land sale, this is&nbsp;the principle in the White Paper which is settled between the Government and the President, and it has been tabled.&nbsp; It is not an arbitrary arrangement.&nbsp; Land&nbsp;is a form of asset.&nbsp; So when you transform one asset into another, you are not earning something, you are just changing from land to the equivalent amount of money.&nbsp; The money can come back and become land.&nbsp;

The civil service and SAF offer exciting careers, pay market salaries, and attract plenty of talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, the Government and statutory boards continue to grab young people at the age of 18.&nbsp; Today, the Ministry of Education announced GCE 'A' level results.&nbsp; Every year, about this time, the <I>Straits Times</I> makes thousands of dollars from its scholarship supplement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our talent pool, however, is quite fixed.&nbsp; So, the scholarship competition is just a zero-sum arms race.&nbsp; Sir, it is time for a performance review of the scholarship system.&nbsp; Scholarship selection is based on interviews and examination results at age 18.&nbsp; However, using such information to predict a person's future aptitude and interest four to 10 years later is almost like speculation.&nbsp; I know this from personal experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, what proportion of Administrative Officers reach the Superscale Grade at the end of their bond?&nbsp; What proportion of SAF officers reach the rank of Colonel at the end of their bond?&nbsp; And likewise for Police officers.&nbsp; I am not saying that the \"failures\" were not talented.&nbsp; It is simply a matter of poor fit&nbsp; -&nbsp; they might have been better suited for another career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who loses from the scholarship scheme?&nbsp; First, the person himself/herself?&nbsp; Young people are attracted to scholarships.&nbsp; Indeed, I have heard that in certain junior colleges, it is shameful not to win an overseas scholarship.&nbsp; Yet, eight, even four years later, will they fit the organisation that they are bonded to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, and ironically, another loser is the scholarship-granting organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp; One loss is the money spent on university tuition and allowances.&nbsp; A bigger loss is&nbsp;in the morale and contribution of \"non-scholars\".&nbsp; As I have said, the Government does attract talented people without scholarships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, there is at least a perception that the career opportunities of \"non-scholars\" are limited.&nbsp; Indeed, I have even heard that they are called \"farmers\".&nbsp; This is very disheartening to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third loser from the scholarship&nbsp;is our Singapore universities.&nbsp; We have world-class institutions here.&nbsp; So, why do Government and agencies discriminate between \"overseas\" and \"local\" scholarships?&nbsp; Indeed, in a recent report from the Ministry of Trade and Industry on A*STAR, it also mentioned overseas and local scholarships.&nbsp; Sir, there should be only one class of scholarships.&nbsp; Give the student a fixed sum of money and let him/her choose how to spend it.&nbsp; That would be true empowerment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there was a time for Government scholarships. Let us agree that that time has passed.&nbsp; Forty-one years after independence, our country has matured.&nbsp; Our Government has also matured.&nbsp; It is time to compete for talent on a level playing field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr Tan Tze Wee is not here.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Older Workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):&nbsp;</B> Sir, much has been said about how rapidly our population is ageing, living longer and hence the need for Singaporeans to work longer to provide for their needs.

The Committee on the Employability of Older Workers has made many recommendations on how to help older workers above 62 years old stay employed.&nbsp; In this light, I would like to ask the Public Service Division the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, what is the policy on the employment of older workers above 62 years in the public sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, how many per cent above 62 years old in the public sector over the last three years have been extended or re-employed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, what is the target the public sector has set for the employment of those above 62?&nbsp; How many percent will be extended in employment or offered re-employment?&nbsp; Finally, will the employment of those above 62 be automatically extended or re-offered and, if not, on what conditions will they be denied re-employment or extension of employment?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I wish to speak on the Registration of Criminals Act amendment.&nbsp; The Act was amended recently to allow the records for certain categories&nbsp;to be considered as spent.&nbsp; And the reason behind this was to give offenders a second chance to find jobs.&nbsp; But that amendment only works depending on the question that the employer asks.&nbsp; If the employer asks, \"Do you have a record?\"&nbsp; Then the person can say, \"No\", because it is spent.&nbsp; But if the employer asks, \"Have you ever been convicted of an offence?\"&nbsp; Then the person has to say, \"Yes\".&nbsp; And the purpose behind that amendment is then lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the Government, as a major employer, is considering amending its forms.&nbsp; Its employment application forms, as I currently understand, actually ask the second question, which is \"Have you ever been&nbsp;convicted of an offence?\"&nbsp; I wish to know whether the Government, having amended the Act, will, as a major employer, also walk the talk and amend its forms to give such offenders a second chance.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):</B> Sir, first, let me thank Members of the House for their interest in issues related to the public service.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenges facing the public service are in line with those facing Singapore.&nbsp; The issues confronting us today are more complex and multi-faceted.&nbsp; Some can strike us with immediate and potentially devastating effect, such as a pandemic flu or a terrorist attack.&nbsp; Others are of a longer term but critical nature which will shape our society, country and region for decades to come&nbsp; -&nbsp; education, entrepreneurship, ageing population, healthcare, falling birth rate and new regional dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our citizens are better educated, more globally connected and expect a higher level of service.&nbsp; They also expect more avenues for expression and participation.&nbsp; The public service has to be responsive to these developments.&nbsp; It must adapt and innovate in order to create the right conditions for peace and prosperity, and help seize opportunities for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the public sector consists of 15 Ministries and 66 statutory boards.&nbsp; These agencies, for reasons of accountability, have clear lines of responsibility.&nbsp; However, many issues do cut across agency lines.&nbsp; To be effective, the public service has to think and to act as one.&nbsp; There must be greater inter-agency coordination, not just in policy formulation but also in implementation of policies.&nbsp; This is why the public service is paying much attention now to working on what we call a whole of Government approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various mechanisms have been put in place to tackle cross-agency issues.&nbsp; Where inter-agency problems are due to differences in fundamental policy orientation, there is a need to review the policies themselves and decide on potential policy trade offs, if necessary.&nbsp; To achieve this, we have set up inter-Ministry committees and project teams to carry out reviews.&nbsp; Examples of such high-level panels are the National Population Committee, the Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers and the Committee on Ageing Issues&nbsp; -&nbsp;the last two having recently released their recommendations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much dialogue and collaboration between agencies happen with these committees which draw on public, private and people sector expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We have also created new platforms to sensitise senior public officials to national imperatives and to build a common understanding of the challenges and issues facing Singapore.&nbsp; Managers are also put through milestone courses in the Civil Service College to attune them to cross-agency issues and national considerations so as to increase their capacity to think beyond their departmental work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides addressing issues at the policy level, the public service has also set up similar mechanisms at the operational and implementation level to bring public officers together to resolve operational and service-related issues.&nbsp; One such mechanism, as Mr Wee has pointed out, is the Zero-In-Process, which he has requested for an update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Zero-In-Process Panel&nbsp;(ZIP&nbsp;Panel) was started in 2000.&nbsp; It is a mechanism in the public service to identify and resolve issues faced by members of the public that cut across public agency boundaries.&nbsp; Issues are typically identified through feedback from members of the public.&nbsp; All issues surfaced are addressed.&nbsp; Where appropriate, they will be channelled to the ZIP Panel, which is chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office.&nbsp; If the issue is complex, the ZIP Panel may even commission study teams to look into the issue and make recommendations for its consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2000, the ZIP Panel has identified more than 110 cases for action, with 22 inter-agency teams formed to tackle how the more complex cases can be resolved.&nbsp; For example, the ZIP Panel implemented the no-wrong-door policy in 2004.&nbsp; This policy requires all public officers to put&nbsp;a member of the public in touch with the right agency for help.&nbsp; This has enabled citizens and businesses to get in touch with the right agencies more quickly, instead of being given a run-around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As another example, organisers had to apply for many licences needed to hold community events, concerts, sporting events or exhibitions.&nbsp; As a result of one such specific case that was brought to the ZIP Panel's attention in 2005, a project team was convened to look into the matter.&nbsp; The project team helped to identify the typical licences and permits needed to hold events and made these available to the one-stop on-line business licensing service.&nbsp; This can be done now on this on-line service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the Zero-In-Process, there are other mechanisms to resolve inter-agency issues.&nbsp; The Pro-Enterprise Panel has so far reviewed close to 1,500 suggestions, some of which also involved more than one public agency.&nbsp; Besides responding to public feedback, the public service proactively re-engineers processes to deliver integrated e-services.&nbsp; The on-line business licensing service is a prime example of how more than 30 Government agencies have worked together</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Since the launch of the on-line business licensing service two years ago in 2004, more than 28,000 businesses have benefited from it.&nbsp; The public service strives to function as many agencies, one Government.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the achievement, there will always be cases where we can do better.&nbsp; Citizens and businesses who face problems with inter-agency coordination can surface this for attention at the PS21 website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to have a first-class public service, it is crucial for the public sector to attract a fair share of Singapore's most able people.&nbsp; Government scholarships are important as they are key source of talent to build capable public sector leadership.&nbsp; I would like to assure Prof. Ivan Png that the public sector is careful not to take in more scholars than we need.&nbsp; For the past few years, the total number of Public Service Commission and statutory board scholarships awarded had been kept relatively constant, at an annual average of about 300.&nbsp; For the year 2005, 249 scholarships, 93 in the civil service and 156 from the statutory boards were awarded.&nbsp; This is not a large number, considering that the public service, the Armed Forces and the Home Team have many challenging and demanding jobs that require&nbsp;very good people.&nbsp; It is also not a large number compared to the approximately 12,000 students a year graduating with 'A' level, or&nbsp;approximately 2,800 a year with three 'A' grades or more at their 'A' levels.&nbsp; If there were not sufficient people of high ability in the public service, we would not be able to have the quality and integrity that has become the hallmark of the Singapore Public Service which is recognised, not just in Singapore, but internationally, and we would not have the quality of a public service that the people of Singapore expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students have a choice of whether to apply for a Government scholarship.&nbsp; If they do, they should be aware of the obligations and be ready to commit themselves to&nbsp;a public service career.&nbsp; For those who are not sure if they are suited to a public service career, they can pursue their university education on their own first and then decide on a career after graduation. And the public sector welcomes these individuals to join us if they wish to do so later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Png also asked how many of the scholars achieved Superscale grade or Colonel grade at the end of their bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bond today is six years and it will be quite an achievement if they do achieve Colonel grade or Superscale grade at the end of just six years of service.&nbsp; But many of them do stay on longer in their career, do achieve these grades and reach the highest ranks in the Armed Forces and civil service.&nbsp; That is precisely why we have taken them in.&nbsp; If we did not have such able people joining the civil service, committing and&nbsp;dedicating themselves to the profession, we would not have a constant flow of people, the refresh of people that is required in the service to have at the end of&nbsp;a 15-, 20-, 25-year career -&nbsp;people who can rise to the top and lead these very important organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government scholars are sent to both local and overseas universities.&nbsp; The PSC awards the prestigious Local-Overseas Merit Scholarships which are on par with Overseas Merit Scholarships for an undergraduate education in Singapore with the opportunity to do a masters programme overseas.&nbsp; PSC also sends scholars to top overseas universities in countries like the US, UK,&nbsp;PRC, France, Germany and Japan.&nbsp; Experiencing what the best foreign universities can offer and being exposed to diverse perspectives&nbsp;is good for the public service.&nbsp; We do not want a public service which has been brought up only within Singapore.&nbsp; I think that would not be very good for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep overseas scholars rooted to Singapore, the PSC brings them back after two years of study to attend a mid-course programme and to undergo a&nbsp;six to eight-week attachment in a public service agency.&nbsp; PSC scholars studying overseas can also choose to do their masters locally.&nbsp; Overall, the scholarship schemes have worked well.&nbsp; A vast majority of scholars adapt well to their working environment and live up to the high expectations demanded of them.&nbsp; Those who leave the public sector after working for some years generally still contribute to Singapore in one way or another at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Prof. Png's concern about morale in the service, I assure him that scholars are not automatically placed&nbsp;on a career fast track.&nbsp; I wish all of them could become enormous successes because we have great hopes for them when they join us.&nbsp; But we do assess them on their performance and potential rigorously when they are in the service compared to all other officers in the service and only if they do well, do they progress.&nbsp; They must prove their worth&nbsp;and demonstrate aptitude and ability before they are promoted.&nbsp;The public service values and rewards talent, whether they be scholars or non-scholars.&nbsp; And it certainly would be our loss to neglect talented non-scholars in the service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to&nbsp;an issue of national concern&nbsp;which Mdm Halimah Yacob has touched on&nbsp;-&nbsp;the employability and employment of older workers.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Loh Meng See touched on this yesterday as well.&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has focused on those who are aged 62 and above.&nbsp; I should say that the&nbsp;public sector looks at older workers, not just focusing on this age group, which has specific issues regarding them.&nbsp; But we also look at older workers in general, and we look at workers who are above 40 years of age and see how we can make them more welcome in the public service as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public sector does welcome older workers who have the skills,&nbsp;experience and passion.&nbsp; The public sector has a diverse workforce, comprising both younger and older workers with different strengths and talent to build an effective and efficient service.&nbsp; Recruitment is based on merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector employs a candidate who best fits the job requirements regardless of age, gender or race.&nbsp; Currently, about 39% of public officers are above 40 years old and 17% are above 50 years old.&nbsp; On average, about 15% of the new hires each year are older workers above the age of 40.&nbsp; Between 2002 and 2004, the public sector has recruited more than 2,800 such older workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public sector agencies are free to employ retired officers if these officers wish to continue working and where the agencies have a need for their expertise.&nbsp; Over the past few years, more than 800 officers have been re-employed.&nbsp; This number does not include retirees who are employed on casual terms or on short term, ad hoc projects.&nbsp; The re-employed officers are in a diverse range of jobs, for example, retired teachers are re-employed as adjunct teachers and school counsellors.&nbsp;In the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority, retired officers are re-employed to maintain experimental farms and control stray animals.&nbsp; The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports employs retired SAF and Singapore Police Force officers to undertake operational duties in the juvenile homes.&nbsp; And the Public Utilities Board re-employs about 100 retired staff mostly in the technical fields.&nbsp; So retired officers are being re-employed in the service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a large employer, the public sector has a role in addressing this national concern of&nbsp;employment of older workers.&nbsp; I believe that we can do better without compromising our ability to deliver cost-efficient public service.&nbsp; The Public Service Division will step up efforts to re-orientate the attitude of public agencies towards the employment of older workers.&nbsp; In December last year, we organised a seminar to raise awareness among public sector HR practitioners on this issue and will continue to promote sharing and best practices among the agencies.&nbsp; But PSC recognises that its efforts cannot stop here.&nbsp; It has therefore also engaged Ministries and statutory boards to identify and open up more job opportunities for older workers,&nbsp;and these&nbsp;could also be people&nbsp;who are not&nbsp;directly employed by the public sector.&nbsp; But these could be jobs created in the public sector.&nbsp; For example, the Ministry of Education has worked with private sector companies to provide more than&nbsp;600 security guards for deployment in schools,&nbsp;and many of these positions will be taken up by older&nbsp;workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public sector agencies will also be strongly encouraged to tap on WDA's ADVANTAGE Scheme, to redesign jobs and retrain the older employees.&nbsp; The response from some agencies has been encouraging.&nbsp; We will work with Ministries and statutory boards to create more flexible avenues to re-employ older workers.&nbsp; Although the public sector is not setting hard targets for the employment of older workers, we will be monitoring the progress of public sector agencies closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me close with good news for Ms Indranee Rajah.&nbsp; The civil service supports the movement to give ex-offenders a second chance.&nbsp; As far back as 2000, Ministries have started to employ ex-offenders taking into consideration the type of offences and the nature of the job.&nbsp; We will take the additional step.&nbsp; The civil service will amend the job application form to ask applicants to declare if they have criminal records in Singapore,&nbsp;instead of whether they have ever been convicted in court.&nbsp; Candidates with spent records can now indicate that they do not have any criminal record.&nbsp; The new forms will take effect on 1st April this year.&nbsp; Ministries will work with the statutory boards under their charge to implement similar application forms by the second quarter of 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They are strong Opposition supporters and there is absolutely no danger to the candidates.&nbsp; I hope the Police shall not be so strict</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and allow Opposition candidates to meet their supporters after an election rally.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, Mr Chiam asked for the usual things, such&nbsp;as&nbsp;more rally sites and for election deposits to be reduced, which he had also done in the past, and I am sure he also knows the answers I am going to give.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me deal with the question of deposits first.&nbsp; The law specifies that the election deposit shall be 8% of the total allowances payable to an elected MP in the year before the election.&nbsp; This formula is not a&nbsp; new formula.&nbsp; The formula has been in place since 1954 when the MP allowance was about $500 and the deposit was also $500.&nbsp; So when&nbsp;the MP allowance&nbsp;was subsequently raised,&nbsp;the election&nbsp;deposit&nbsp;was also raised by the same absolute dollar value.&nbsp; Then, later on, we decided that instead of changing it&nbsp;every time the MP allowance was raised, we just have a formula.&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula is 8% of the total MP allowances payable in the preceding year.&nbsp; Therefore, it works out to be about $13,500 for the next election.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we reduce this to just $5,000 as Mr Chiam suggested?&nbsp; At one time, he even asked for much less than that.&nbsp; I would say that election is a very serious business.&nbsp; People who want to contest in the election must really have the ability or the confidence to be able to even get 12.5% of the valid votes.&nbsp; That is all he needs.&nbsp; If he can get 12.5% of the valid votes, he gets back his money.&nbsp; Very few candidates who took part in elections actually lost the election deposits.&nbsp; I have explained in this House before why, in the previous election, two candidates lost their deposits.&nbsp; One was because he just did not show up at all in Ayer Rajah.&nbsp; The other was because he went to contest in a single constituency where there were three candidates and he did not appeal enough to win even 12.5% and, therefore, he lost the deposit.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He could not get the last night because he was late, he lost out to the PAP candidate, so he went to Lavender Street.&nbsp; As a result, he&nbsp;attracted 13,000 people who went to attend this rally.&nbsp; Imagine that if&nbsp;the police did not have a system to ensure the security of the candidate, I am sure Mr Chiam would have&nbsp;found great difficulty in getting out of that situation where almost 200 of them went quite unruly and, as a result, quite a number got arrested for&nbsp;their unruliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

On the question of reducing the size of the GRC to three, it really does not matter whether we have bigger or smaller GRCs, more singles or fewer.&nbsp; It is a question of whether the parties themselves are able to get enough people to contest in the election.&nbsp; And it is not the PAP's fault that the Opposition parties have not been able to get enough candidates.&nbsp; I think those who say that the PAP has denied the people a choice should ask themselves: should they themselves not take part in them?&nbsp; I have heard of the panel discussion reported in the papers just a few days ago that the PAP had denied the people a choice.&nbsp; I think those panel members should go and form a political party.&nbsp;

Members, including myself, have spoken about Singaporeans' inadequacy of savings for retirement and have argued on the urgent need to tackle this problem.&nbsp; With dwindling CPF contributions and the SRS losing favour because of its excessive restrictions on the scheme, the retirement nest-egg for Singaporeans is shrinking.&nbsp; Hence, further to what I have said during the Budget Statement debate, I would like to propose the following changes be made to section 5 of the Income Tax Act, so as to expand the options available to employers and employees to save for their old age.&nbsp; The proposals have no bearing on the current CPF and SRS, which should also be enhanced to encourage higher savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; I welcome news to establish retirement schemes that will enable employers and/or employees to contribute directly to a retirement savings plan;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Limits for defined contribution plans should be capped at 20% of salary less employer contribution to CPF, instead of being capped at the level of benefit pay-out;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Employers should have the discretion to determine eligibility to the retirement benefit plan;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Employers should have flexibility in determining contribution level or benefit level;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Pooling of the retirement funds under one master trust to attract low unit cost from fund managers should also be permitted;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Portability of the retirement savings should also be permitted;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; The benefits withdrawn at retirement should be tax-exempt, provided that they are used to purchase an annuity;

Sir, I believe these recommendations can provide relative tax efficiency at least at the tax contribution end, impose the discipline that the SRS lacks and could be used to assist the Government's undoubted aim of devolving retirement responsibilities to the private sector.&nbsp; They also provide tax-efficient benefits to foreign nationals who are always on the look-out for safe and tax-incentivised environments to park their funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Approved Holding Companies</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a major reason why Singapore's endeavour to establish itself as the regional capital for holding companies has been lukewarm may be attributable to the uncertainty over the treatment of gains from the disposal of subsidiaries and other investments.&nbsp; To encourage more MNCs to locate their holding functions in Singapore, it was proposed in the recent Budget announcement that gains by approved holding companies on the disposal of shares in subsidiaries will be exempt from tax, provided that at least 50% of the shares are owned and the shares have been held for a period of not less than 18 months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the announced changes are&nbsp;encouraging, there is a lack of clarity of the definition of an approved holding company and whether it means simply approved for this very purpose.&nbsp; To make this scheme more attractive, I would like to propose that the term \"approved holding company\" be properly defined to remove any ambiguity and the requirement for the shares to be held for the specified period be removed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Employee Stock Options</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to make the wage system more flexible, companies should be given wider choices of flexi-components to be incorporated in the overall compensation of employees.&nbsp; An option that is increasingly being used today is to link employee remuneration to the company's performance by granting stock options or direct share awards, ie,&nbsp;share-based compensation.&nbsp; Companies that grant share-based compensation in the form of its own shares have two ways of meeting their obligations.&nbsp; They can either issue</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

And for some strategic industries, they are granted preferential tax rates or exemptions.&nbsp; The question is:&nbsp; would we be able to be more competitive and more attractive to other general direct foreign investments, if our corporate income tax were to be lower?&nbsp; Can we be ahead of the curve and not be just there?&nbsp; Do we know how much investments we will be able to attract to Singapore and how many more jobs we can create if we were to reduce our corporate income tax to, say, 18%?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, a quick calculation is that the tax forgone is about $770 million and this is equivalent to 3.1% reduction of the operating expenditure. The question is:&nbsp; has MOF not explored this and see if the reduction is worthwhile? After all, if we create more jobs, we will also reduce the amount of assistance we need to extend through Progress packages and so on whilst having more corporations and workers paying taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, estate duty.&nbsp; Much has been said but it bears repeating.&nbsp; I agree that in old societies where there were few opportunities to socially move upwards and where wealth&nbsp;was represented by great estates and other fixed assets, it was more justifiable to tax inherited wealth to preserve social equity.&nbsp; However, the situation is quite different today.&nbsp; In our&nbsp;meritocratic society, there are numerous opportunities for those in poor families to succeed.&nbsp; Our education system and scholarship scheme all exist to preserve social equity and cohesion.&nbsp; Besides, a fool who&nbsp;inherit wealth will soon part with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, only 3% of the 16,000 deaths pay estate duties and it seems only 2% of those dutiable cases contribute 70% of duty assessed.&nbsp; And it is estimated that only $70 million will be collected, maybe no small sum, as PM said.&nbsp; But I think the continuance of estate duty certainly runs counter to our aim to be an international wealth management centre,&nbsp;our attraction to global entrepreneur who has made his pile.&nbsp; And this is even more jarring when Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Hong Kong have all abolished estate duty in recent years.&nbsp; I am sure that the PM knows that estate planners and experts publicly share six best ways to avoid death taxes.&nbsp; However, when they advise you privately, they share with you another 36-lesson own ways.&nbsp; I hope the review will be expeditiously undertaken. Some people are counting on it.&nbsp; They cannot afford to die otherwise.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Lawrence Leow,&nbsp;you have two cuts.

These are inevitable situations as both GLCs and SMEs are equally entitled to bid for such projects.&nbsp; However, by virtue of their size and background, GLCs have a distinct advantage over their smaller counterparts, and&nbsp;from feedback gathered, GLCs are almost always favoured over SMEs in&nbsp;a head-on competition for the same projects.&nbsp; I would acknowledge that in certain situations, it could well be a problem of a perception rather than GLCs being granted an edge over SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, besides feedback that I receive&nbsp;on this matter, on a personal note, I have also similar experience, so I would say that the problem does exist.&nbsp; It is more a question of extent than existence.&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare that I have an interest here, as I too run a SME setup and would definitely get into situations where business comes into competition with GLCs for projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interest of fair competition, I have put forth this cut in the hope of having a more level playing field that SMEs can thrive on.&nbsp; I am fully aware that our Government operates a <I>laissez faire</I> environment, leaving the market to set the price and determine the outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not suggesting that we have to deviate from such a policy.&nbsp; Neither am I calling for SMEs to be accorded special treatment.&nbsp; However, to uphold fair competition, and to better align our objective of promoting the growth and development of SMEs, some measures have to be instituted to allow SMEs a fair and equal chance when they get into a competitive situation with GLCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to propose that for projects of relevance, the review and award committee that is tasked with the job of evaluating the bids and&nbsp;making the final decision on the award of such projects, include representatives that are neutral, such as representatives from the Pro-Enterprise Panel that&nbsp;could provide a more balanced approach to the evaluation process leading to the award of the projects. This would also help to eliminate any perception problem, as&nbsp;the saying that \"justice must be seen to be done\" is of great relevance in such a situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a review and award committee that is seen to be neutral would go a long way to correcting any misperceptions the SMEs may hold.&nbsp; Sir, incidentally, I am also a member of the Pro-Enterprise Panel and&nbsp; I would like to clarify that my suggestion to have the representation from the Panel stems purely from the intent of injecting a greater sense of neutrality to the evaluation and award process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the evaluation and award process, the size of a project, if it is too big, could well rule out&nbsp;SME's participation. Where feasible,&nbsp;a project should be broken down to smaller parts or make them \"bite size\" so that SMEs can have the opportunity as well as the resources to take a bite and have a share of the pie.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also advocate for a strong message to be issued from the PM's Office, emphasising the need to grant SMEs a fair and equal chance to succeed in their bids for public projects, in the light of upholding fair competition.&nbsp; The above are just some suggestions and a more comprehensive set of measures has to be devised and implemented for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in essence, I would like to know if the Government has in place, and if not, whether the Government would consider putting in place measures to ensure a more level playing field, that would allow SMEs an equal chance of securing public projects when they are faced with competition from the GLCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Age Limit for Business</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our youths today are no longer quite the same as those of older generation. They are knowledgeable, more IT-savvy and have better access and resources to pursue their interest. This has led to quite an encouraging number of our youths owning inventions and IP.&nbsp; However, by virtue of their age, they are unable to form a company to register their invention and IP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many from this group are students from the polytechnics and other local institutions, who are eager to take the entrepreneurial route but are unable to register a company in their own names because of age restrictions. Often, they have to register their invention or business in the names of their parents or friends, to circumvent the problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we are actively promoting entrepreneurship amongst our younger generation and are encouraging them to be innovative and to take risks, we could be sending a contrasting signal by forbidding them from registering their business or invention in their own capacity because of age restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, people below the age of 21 years old are considered as minors and not allowed to register a business in their names.&nbsp; However, from what I have found out, many countries in the world have lower age restrictions on business registration.&nbsp; In countries like the United States, England and Wales, there is no specific age restriction, while in&nbsp;Germany, Australia and New Zealand, the age limit for setting up a business is 18 years old.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Hong Kong, the age limit is also 18 years old.&nbsp;With a population of about 7 million versus 4 million in our case, Hong Kong has some 450,000 business establishments as compared to about 150,000 here.&nbsp; I am not certain if the proportionately higher number of business set up in Hong Kong as compared to Singapore, has anything to do with the lower age restriction on setting up businesses, but the statistics do seem to suggest that there may be some correlation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not suggesting to leave the age limit entirely, but I do feel very strongly for&nbsp;a case of lowering the age limit on setting up businesses to 18 years old.&nbsp; I acknowledge that people below the age of 21 years old are deemed as minors.&nbsp; However, we ought to give due regard to the world we are in today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as our youths today are quite discerning and better poised to assume greater responsibility, we should trust that they would be responsible businessmen.&nbsp; For those who may be concerned about dealing with businesses run by people for whom they deem as too young, we should let them assess their own risks and make their own judgement calls whether to deal with such businesses. After all, it is really a case of <I>caveat emptor</I>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if there are no big problems in those countries that operate a restriction on the age of 18 years old, I cannot foresee the problem to be of any greater if we were to implement it here in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to know if the Government would consider allowing people of age 18 to set up a business here.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Government Procurement</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim:</B>&nbsp; Increasingly, we hear of the term private financing initiative (PFI) in Government procurement.&nbsp; I wish to ask about our PFI experience to-date, especially after reading of interest a recent <I>Straits Times</I>' article on its unclear outcomes in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; What are the guidelines and mechanisms used in assessment of PFI projects to ensure that they make financial sense from a taxpayer's perspective?&nbsp; How do we prevent loading operating expenses of future years with what ought to be current year's capital?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that PFI is new.

Howe, a cross-country study of 36 countries, and if you look at what is called the effective tax rate, which is&nbsp;the share of tax payable as a percentage of your pre-tax return on capital, Singapore is No. 1, ahead of Ireland and&nbsp;Hong Kong.&nbsp; So we are very competitive.&nbsp; It is not just the headline rate.&nbsp; But this is not something that is cast in stone.&nbsp; We constantly monitor this.&nbsp; We see what our competitors are doing and the aim, as I have just&nbsp;said,&nbsp; is not to have the lowest, not necessarily the lowest, but to have a corporate income tax rate that is competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On estate duty, I take note&nbsp;that now there are not only&nbsp;six ways, as enunciated by <I>Straits Times,</I> but 42 ways to avoid it.&nbsp; This is something that we are looking at.&nbsp; Our starting&nbsp;point,&nbsp;our operating philosophy, has been that we want everybody to have an equal start in life and not to have undue advantage over inherited wealth through structural advantages like this.&nbsp; But, again, we weigh this against&nbsp;all the arguments that you heard or&nbsp;read about and also debated in this Chamber, that many countries have abolished it,&nbsp;it might affect our&nbsp;aspiration to be a wealth management centre and, as was pointed out, you can get expert advice on how not to pay it.&nbsp; So we are looking at that and we hope to come to a conclusion by the next Budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our key economic strategies, and this relates to what Dr Ahmad brought up just now, is to develop Singapore as a centre for HQ activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member&nbsp;may be pleased to note, because&nbsp;he mentioned that the response has&nbsp;been underwhelming,&nbsp;that actually it has been&nbsp;quite successful.&nbsp; With EDB, under their IHQ scheme, there are 350 companies under them.&nbsp; We have about 7,000 MNCs in Singapore and 4,000 of them locate their HQ activities in Singapore.&nbsp; The Approved Holding Company Scheme is to enhance and to make it more attractive.&nbsp; So to be an approved holding company, to begin with, you have got to qualify for the EDB HQ&nbsp;Scheme and the requirements there include how much fixed asset investments you are putting into Singapore, total business spending, the amount of jobs you generate.&nbsp; That is one.&nbsp; And, the business that you run should be an operating business, like a manufacturing business, for instance,&nbsp;and not one that simply deals with trading shares.&nbsp; So that is how you qualify the company for being a HQ company under the EDB scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have done is to enhance this scheme.&nbsp; Because if you are an approved HQ company, sometimes you might need to transfer or sell your shares in a subsidiary.&nbsp; So we put down two conditions, one that it should own 50% of the subsidiary, the other&nbsp;that the shares that you have, you should hold it for&nbsp;18 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has&nbsp;suggested why&nbsp;not get rid of this&nbsp;18-month holding period.&nbsp; There are good reasons for having&nbsp;18 months.&nbsp; It is to ensure that you are not in the business of trading the shares.&nbsp; That is why you have this 18-month holding&nbsp;period.&nbsp; This is not something that we are inflexible on.&nbsp; If you do not qualify for whatever reasons, including if you are below the holding period, we will review&nbsp;on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; It is not as though the door is shut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to being the centre for HQ activities is our aim to become a knowledge hub and exchange.&nbsp; An important part of the knowledge exchange is to attract and retain talent.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think&nbsp;the Member has&nbsp;mentioned about the different remuneration schemes that companies are now&nbsp;coming up with in order to retain talent.&nbsp; We recognise this - this is the reason&nbsp;we made it&nbsp;a matter of policy that remuneration in the form of employee share options or direct share award would&nbsp;qualify for tax deduction if actual outlay is&nbsp;incurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has raised, I think, four questions.&nbsp; One is when&nbsp;a&nbsp;multinational corporation subsidiary in Singapore had&nbsp;incurred share-related cost&nbsp;under ESOP, is it tax deductible?&nbsp; The answer is yes, it is tax deductible.&nbsp; The two other questions, I think, are related.&nbsp; Treasury shares,&nbsp;we allow now.&nbsp; With treasury shares, what happens if, while holding the treasury shares, it goes up in value?&nbsp; Is it taxable?&nbsp; I think, the other issue that he&nbsp;raised, he said, what if you have excess treasury shares and then you sell the excess?&nbsp; All these things,&nbsp;you really have got to base on facts.&nbsp; You have to look at the details, but I can give you the principle involved here.&nbsp; The principle is that we would not tax it if the purchase of these treasury shares was not meant for trading.&nbsp; That means you treat the gains&nbsp;as&nbsp;capital.&nbsp; As a capital gain, we will not tax.&nbsp; But as I said,&nbsp;all these things&nbsp;turn on the details, on the facts of each individual case.&nbsp; That is the underlying principle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;he brought up the issue of what happens if you bought the shares at different times?&nbsp; How do you value these shares?&nbsp; Well, this is something that IRAS is now taking feedback on and they are working it out and they will issue a circular soon -&nbsp;the details on&nbsp;how to treat this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now speak about maintaining a conducive and business friendly&nbsp;regulatory environment.&nbsp; Mr Lawrence Leow has asked if the Government is looking into lowering the age limit to promote entrepreneurship among the young, say, maybe lower it&nbsp;to below 18 years old.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently a person below 21 cannot set up a business independently as the minimum age to be a company director or business owner is tied to the age of contractual liability, which is currently 21.&nbsp; This is important as companies entering into contracts with directors and owners ought to have the assurance that the contracts are enforceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is right&nbsp;that&nbsp;jurisdictions, such as Australia, Hong Kong, the US and the UK, have reduced the age of contractual capacity to lower than 21.&nbsp; My Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, is&nbsp;studying the desirability of lowering the age of contractual capacity, which could then pave the way for lowering the minimum age to be a director or owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this study, we will also look at other statutory constraints, like the ability to hold land, which may prevent a young person from entering into and conducting business in Singapore.&nbsp; The merits of lowering the age to below 21 years old must be weighed against possible risks to parties to enter into a commercial relationships with young directors and owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leow has also raised the issue of Government procurement rules.&nbsp; Our rules aim to achieve value for money in public expenditure through fair and open competition.&nbsp; We do not favour GLCs or SMEs -&nbsp; fair and open competition.&nbsp; We do not give preference to or discriminate against any supplier, whether local or foreign, large or small, Government-owned or otherwise.&nbsp; Each supplier is assessed on its own merits.&nbsp; We believe this is the best way to grow a strong, resilient and competitive business.&nbsp; I believe that a vibrant SME sector is an important part of the economy.&nbsp; SMEs do face some inherent difficulties due to their size.&nbsp; They are small and so they have certain inherent disadvantages.&nbsp; Competition from bigger companies is inevitable.&nbsp; The way to help them is not to give them preferential treatment on Government contracts, but to enhance their capabilities and opportunities to better compete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in response to Mr Leow's question as to what are some of the things we are trying to do to facilitate SMEs to better compete, what we have sought to do is to make it easier for them to participate in the Government procurement market.&nbsp; First, we have amended our rules so that we no longer require a track record for the purpose of registration as a Government supplier.&nbsp; New start-ups and SMEs can now register and bid for Government procurement tenders straight off.&nbsp; Second, SMEs can join forces by forming consortia to bid for high value tenders without forgoing their individual identities.&nbsp; To facilitate SMEs coming together to participate in such tenders, MOF has issued a new set of guidelines to recognise the combined strength of smaller companies.&nbsp; Third, on 1st April 2005, suppliers were given one free user account for GeBiz, the Government's e-procurement portal which all suppliers of products and services to the Government are expected to use.&nbsp; This helps cut business cost for the suppliers, especially SMEs.&nbsp; From 1st April 2005 to 1st December 2005, the number of suppliers registered with GeBiz as a trading partner has increased from 11,000 to 17,500, a 59% increase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the good news is, and this is in reference to&nbsp;his point&nbsp;on whether&nbsp;GLCs get more contracts than SMEs,&nbsp;that our smaller enterprises, our SMEs, have fared well against the competition when it comes to Government tenders.&nbsp; Out of 374 Government tender contracts below $100,000, awarded between April and November last year, 70% went to companies with net assets below $250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me touch on what Mr Wee Siew Kim brought up on public-private partnership or public finance initiatives, as he referred to them.&nbsp; This is another form of Government procurement.&nbsp; PPPs are long term partnering relationships where we bring together the expertise and resources of the public and private sectors to deliver services to the public at the best value for money.&nbsp; We have awarded four PPP tenders to-date.&nbsp; It will take time to fully evaluate the benefits.&nbsp; But the early results are encouraging.&nbsp; For instance, taking the PPP approach for the desalination and NeWater project has helped to lower the overall cost of water.&nbsp; By leaving the choice of desalination technology to the private sector, PUB was able to purchase desalinated water at a price which is highly competitive internationally.&nbsp; The PPP tender for the NeWater project also yielded very favourable tariffs.&nbsp; The guideline is that PPPs should be considered for all projects above $50 million in capital value.&nbsp; Given their scale, the PPP providers tend to be a consortium.&nbsp; SMEs can participate in the PPP consortium as partners, contractors or subcontractors.&nbsp; Our first PPP project to supply desalinated water to PUB was, in fact, awarded to Hyflux, a home-grown local enterprise.&nbsp; Hyflux's Chief Executive, Olivia Lum, said that the PPP scheme had actually made it easier for the SMEs to participate in such large scale projects.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked her when we had&nbsp;the launch of the PPP scheme&nbsp;and she said it is because of the consortium arrangement where the main company is likely to outsource work to other smaller companies without these smaller companies having to go through a tendering process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final point&nbsp;I would like to make on Government procurement, as brought up by&nbsp;Mr Lawrence Leow, is how do we evaluate it?&nbsp; Evaluation of tenders and the decision on the award of tenders are kept separate.&nbsp; They are decided by different committees in the public sector agencies.&nbsp; This is to ensure both rigour and due process in Government procurement.&nbsp; It is neither appropriate nor desirable for an external party such as the Pro-Enterprise Panel to decide on a Government agency's procurement.&nbsp; What is critical is to have decisions made at the right level, with good checks in place, to ensure fairness and thoroughness in evaluation to make sure that we secure cost effective contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thrust of our fiscal policy is to create an environment that is beneficial for citizens in providing them hope and progress for the future and the opportunity to be the best that they can be.&nbsp; We have over the years lowered the personal income tax rate and made&nbsp;changes to our tax system.&nbsp;At the same time, our tax treatment of savings aims to encourage Singaporeans to save for their long-term needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad has raised the issue of retirement saving plans.&nbsp; In Singapore, the CPF system provide the basic framework for retirement savings.&nbsp; Tax exemption is given for contributions in investment returns and withdrawals.&nbsp; Those who wish to set aside more for their retirement savings, over and above the mandatory CPF contributions, have several avenues today.&nbsp; I think it is useful just to outline them.&nbsp; First, Singaporeans and PRs can make voluntary CPF contributions to top up their mandatory CPF contributions up to&nbsp;a ceiling&nbsp;of $25,245 per year.&nbsp;These voluntary contributions enjoy the same interest rates as CPF monies although they do not qualify for tax relief.&nbsp; Second, they can also contribute to the supplementary retirement scheme, SRS, which I think&nbsp;he mentioned just now, which provides tax deferrable benefits.&nbsp; Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief and investment returns are not taxed at the time of accrual.&nbsp; Only 50% of the withdrawals are taxable at retirement.&nbsp; But, with proper streaming of the withdrawals after retirement, many people would pay little or no income tax on their SRS withdrawals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SRS contribution cap is linked to the CPF salary ceiling as the SRS is also meant for foreigners wanting to save for their retirement but who no longer enjoy tax relief for CPF contributions.&nbsp; The CPF salary ceiling is set at the 80th income percentile.&nbsp; Those who earn more than the 80th percentile should be able to save more if they want more for their retirement.&nbsp; They should not expect the Government to provide tax benefits for doing so.&nbsp; The SRS can be part of the extra savings but is&nbsp;tied to the CPF salary ceiling.&nbsp; Dr Magad has asked whether the SRS scheme can be enhanced.&nbsp; I think Members during the Budget debate have also raised the same issue.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance is prepared to review the SRS contribution cap in the years to come.&nbsp; But such a review has to be done within the larger context of enhancing Singaporeans' retirement adequacy, including the question of how to improve the rate of return on CPF money as mentioned by Mr Inderjit Singh in the Budget debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Dr Magad referred to section 5 of the Income Tax Act.&nbsp; Under section 5, employers can enjoy a tax deduction for making contributions for their employees to pension funds approved under the Act.&nbsp; But, there is a qualifier.&nbsp; All of these funds must be for retirement benefits and must be available to all staff.&nbsp; Dr Magad has suggested that we leave it to employers as to who shall benefit from this scheme.&nbsp; If we allow this, it will become a scheme which companies can use for attracting and retaining key personnel, mostly executives, rather than a scheme for supplementing the retirement benefits of all employees.&nbsp; This does not mean that we should, therefore, not allow it.&nbsp; It means that if we do allow it, it is for purposes of attracting talent rather than&nbsp;enhancing retirement adequacy of everyone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Are we being extravagant in such expenses whilst stingy with our own citizens' future?&nbsp; What is the expected return on this investment economically in terms of branding, reputation or goodwill-wise?&nbsp;

Sir, what kind of rise in our higher asset base from FY 2005 to FY 2006?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are&nbsp;we talking about that can cause such a large jump of more than 100% in our investment expenses?&nbsp; Are the MOF officers being taken for a ride with high-churning activities in the investment market by traders, thus leading to high trading volume and high expense cost?&nbsp; It is incredible to learn of such high expense from our stable Government reserves.&nbsp; What is our current total reserve asset and what is the total investment returns over the last five years?&nbsp; I think we are paying too high an expense ratio and not getting satisfactory returns from our investments.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, we now have regular updates from Temasek on its performance.&nbsp; GIC also seems to be generating very good returns over the years.&nbsp; I am encouraged by this.&nbsp; In my speech on&nbsp;the Budget,&nbsp;I mentioned about my hope that both Temasek and GIC will return higher percentages to the CPF so that our Singaporeans' returns will be better.&nbsp; But before we can do this, we, of course, need to ensure that we can continue to generate good returns.&nbsp; I have three questions in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, while the returns made by Temasek and GIC look good,&nbsp;how good is good?&nbsp; Can we understand how both organisations benchmark themselves?&nbsp; In other words, how do their performance compare to equivalent organisations, companies or funds which engage in similar activities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, how do we account for the significant losses that happen from time to time, like the large write-off recently made by DBS and the expected write-off by other Temasek companies which also have made high profile, expensive acquisitions lately?&nbsp; My main worry is whether we are moving into an era where we can no longer expect good returns from both these organisations.&nbsp; The question is: how do Temasek and GIC manage such write-offs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, how do both organisations account and manage the risk of investments done outside Singapore?&nbsp; I know that we can do this well in Singapore, but how do we do it outside Singapore?&nbsp; It will be useful to understand what is done to manage the risk to give comfort to Singaporeans, and moving forward, the money that we have will be well protected.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Members have heard the Prime Minister.&nbsp; Every dollar the Government spends has first to be earned.&nbsp; Members of this House can be assured that we are conscious of the need to live within our means. Our philosophy is always to exercise prudence in spending and to deliver more for the dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Steve Chia is concerned about the budget allocated for organising the annual meetings of the Boards of Governors of the IMF and the World Bank group.&nbsp; I would like to state that we do not take this expenditure lightly.&nbsp; We&nbsp;decided to bid to host the meetings only after much deliberation and hard-headed assessment of the costs and benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just spell out briefly the benefits that these meetings would bring to Singapore.&nbsp; Firstly, strategic benefits.&nbsp; We aim to develop Singapore as a global knowledge hub&nbsp;- a place where people, businesses and non-profit organisations converge and exchange ideas.&nbsp; Hosting premier international events is an integral part of this strategy, as it will help establish the Singapore brand globally, which he does not deny.&nbsp; Hosting meetings like the IOC and the World Trade Organisation's Ministerial Conference provides a unique opportunity to present ourselves to the rest of the world as gracious host, meticulous planners and efficient organisers.&nbsp; Moreover, playing host to a meeting focused on promoting economic development, alleviating poverty and fostering macro economic and financial stability will also reinforce Singapore's reputation as a responsible global citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the economic benefits.&nbsp; In addition to the official&nbsp;annual meetings, there will be at least 300 other meetings and events held concurrently during that time.&nbsp; With the bulk of the expenses borne by the private sector and accruing to the local businesses, there are significant spillover effects on our economy.&nbsp; In terms of tangible economic output, practically all the $135 million that it would cost to organise the whole event would go to contracts for local businesses.&nbsp; In relative terms, I would like to assure Mr Chia that Singapore's expected expenditure is commensurate with that of previous hosts.&nbsp; The IMF/World Bank meetings in 2003, which was hosted by Dubai, incurred expenditures of over $360 million, though that included the construction of a brand new convention centre just to house the meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With 16,000 foreign visitors converging in Singapore in September, the meetings would also generate&nbsp;at least $50 million in tourism receipts.&nbsp; As it is, almost all the hotels and functions rooms in downtown hotels and conference venues have already been booked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are mindful, Sir, of getting value for money and keeping costs down but without compromising on security or good organisation.&nbsp; Just to give a little example of the exercise of innovation.&nbsp; For example, to provide some 1,000 office premises for the delegates, the organising committee opted to build temporary offices within Suntec itself rather than to retrofit hotel rooms into office spaces.&nbsp; And this creative solution saved us over $4.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second aspect of seeking value for money in Government is&nbsp;to ensure adequate returns on our investments.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has asked about performance benchmarking and risk management for GIC and Temasek.&nbsp; Our investment objective for Government's reserves managed by GIC and Temasek is to achieve good long-term risk adjusted returns on a sustainable basis.&nbsp; GIC is the Government's fund manager, managing a globally diversified portfolio of assets comprising a whole range from equities, bonds, real estate, private equity and other assets.&nbsp; Temasek is the Government's investment holding company with stakes in a broad range of companies, principally in Singapore and the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As fund owner and shareholder respectively, Government holds GIC and Temasek accountable for returns and overall performance.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance regularly reviews the performance of GIC and Temasek with the boards and management.&nbsp; We are satisfied that GIC and Temasek have performed creditably against comparable benchmarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what are these benchmarks?&nbsp; In the case of GIC, the performance of each asset class is benchmarked against relevant international measures like the Morgan Stanley Capital International, or commonly referred to as MSCI Equity Indices and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.&nbsp; Performance is also evaluated against other peers. On this basis, GIC has achieved good long-term returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the case of Temasek, since inception, Temasek has delivered 18% total shareholder return by market value and 16% total shareholder return based on shareholder's funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investments taken by GIC and Temasek are subject to rigorous&nbsp;risk management and internal control frameworks.&nbsp; These address all the major categories of investment risks, including market risk, credit risk, regulatory risk, operational risk and political risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance is involved in deciding the long-term return objectives, the risk tolerance levels and the asset mix for the Government's funds managed by GIC.&nbsp; As for Temasek, MOF endorses the overall strategic directions for its investments.&nbsp; However, the Government does not get involved in individual investments, leaving these to the respective boards and management.&nbsp; It is not for Government to approve each investment by GIC and Temasek, much less the Temasek companies, nor for us to second guess the risk assessments.&nbsp; Such micro management will ultimately be counter productive.&nbsp; What is important is that there is a good governance framework, regular performance evaluation, robust risk management and an effective system of checks and balances.&nbsp; These, I can assure Members, are in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Steve Chia has also asked about the increase in investment expenses.&nbsp; Allow me to explain very briefly.&nbsp; The expenses on investments should not be viewed in isolation but within the context of the size and nature of the investments.&nbsp; The increase in EOI in recent years reflects really three things: first, the growth in the asset size; secondly, the investments in new markets and products; and, thirdly, accounting effects</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>arising from changes in investment strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the&nbsp;increase was due to a greater&nbsp;use of investment instruments like interest rate swaps.

What is our competitive advantage?&nbsp;Although \"The Banker\" magazine ranked Singapore as the \"Financial centre of the future\" and <I>Forbes</I> magazine estimated that Singapore will overtake Switzerland as the leading centre of offshore private banking by the year 2008, I was&nbsp;curious about what else we must do to realise these prophecies.&nbsp; To be on the cutting edge, we need to innovate existing products as well as scan the global playground for emerging trends.&nbsp; I would like to highlight two rapidly growing niche markets - they are the philanthropic wealth management and micro-finance industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On philanthropy, there is a worldwide acceleration of philanthropy gifting, as witnessed by younger founders of companies like Google&nbsp;which has recently given&nbsp;US$100 million as micro-finance endowment fund, Salesforce.com that has got a 1% rule, Gates and Melinda Foundation, etc, which all accelerated the pace of large sum giftings. How does Singapore intend to tap into this multi-billion industry?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On micro-finance, Credit Suisse estimated the need for micro-credit to be at US$100 billion, with a short-term market size&nbsp;of between US$15-US$20 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks that traditionally serve the upper markets, like UBS,&nbsp;Credit Suisse and Citibank, have all jumped on the bandwagon to offer a suite of micro-finance products like bond funds, micro-savings, micro-insurance, and so on.&nbsp;It is a high growth industry, fueled by market size and profitability.&nbsp; It witnessed growth rates of between 20%-40%, with extensive diversity in structures and frameworks across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore, I feel, can envision to be (a) a leader in humanitarian issue of providing meaningful opportunity to the low income, as MOS Lim Hwee Hua said it will enhance our reputation as a responsible global citizen; (b) we can be a leader in innovative financial services and lead in the creation of a new micro-finance securities, similar to how asset backed securities were created in the 1990s, and established Singapore as the global centre for trading these securities,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Chicago being the leading futures or options exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geographically, we are blessed to be in the heart of the emerging wealth centre and micro-finance industry in Asia.&nbsp; In economic terms, we have both the supply and demand right at our doorstep.&nbsp; Hence, may I ask:&nbsp;can we&nbsp;widen our horizon and explore positioning Singapore as a global leader in the emerging fields of philanthropic wealth management and micro-finance?&nbsp; These, together with existing focus on the Islamic finance and banking, pension or retirement funding, markets, REITS, etc, can help to strengthen our position as a global finance hub.&nbsp; Why not let a thousand flowers bloom with some innovative fertilisers and&nbsp;Singapore sun?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First of all, I would like to declare my interest as a person helping to promote the setting up of&nbsp;an OTC in Singapore.&nbsp; I have been directly involved with a private company to encourage them to set up one in the manner which my committee in ACE envisioned.&nbsp; My involvement in this private company is purely voluntary and I derive no benefit or compensation from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been&nbsp;talking about setting up of a private equity exchange or OTC which will be an excellent alternative platform&nbsp;to help growing companies raise funds.&nbsp;

We passed the legislation about a year ago, I think in February last year, to allow something like an OTC to be set up in Singapore.&nbsp; I know that MAS has many concerns and hence the delay for approvals.&nbsp;

Sir, I would like to support Mr Inderjit Singh on this issue.&nbsp; For some time now, it has been proposed that a third board on the Stock Exchange be set up&nbsp;in order to allow young start-up companies, especially those from the new technology sector, to raise early capital.&nbsp; This could be similar to the OTC or BB market in the USA, the NSX in Australia, or GEM in Hong Kong.&nbsp;Although there is much concern regarding the quality of companies listed on such a platform and their corporate governance, these issues could be resolved by letting buyers of shares listed on the third board know of the much higher risks that were involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can participate with open eyes and, unless there is fraud involved, the Government should not over-regulate this marketplace.&nbsp;Since we already have our strict measures in place to control fraud and other commercial criminal activities, there should be an arena for those who want to take higher risks in order to seek higher profits to invest their money in.&nbsp; A technology-based third board would be ideal.&nbsp; It will help technopreneurs who today find it difficult to raise funds for their new inventions to progress.&nbsp; Despite reports of much available capital, most still gravitate towards more traditional businesses and more mature companies.&nbsp; The third board would make technology start-ups more visible and these could offer themselves as an alternative avenue for investments.&nbsp; It could be most rewarding to diversify a small part of an investment portfolio in such companies because of the manifold returns each success could bring when it grows into multi-million dollar giants.&nbsp; This would also bring much economic benefits to Singapore.&nbsp; Could the Finance Minister&nbsp;give an indication when such a trading board would be ready?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It appears that the lenders are not very particular about who they lend to as long as they meet the minimum conditions.&nbsp; But if the borrowers default in the terms and&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;of the loan agreement, especially those concerning repayments, the lenders also appear to be very fast in foreclosing the loans.&nbsp;During the past few years, when the economy was performing poorly, the number of borrowers who defaulted also increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about housing loans.&nbsp; Many have lost their jobs and suffered a cut in income and were unable to service their housing loans.&nbsp; The lenders took steps to foreclose the loans.&nbsp; Some borrowers appealed to the lenders to adjust the repayment scheme in view of the financial difficulties.&nbsp; But the lenders prefer to foreclose the loans since then.&nbsp; In other cases, the&nbsp;borrowers' financial situation&nbsp;improves, as they said they could find a new job and could resume servicing the loans.&nbsp; But again, the lender was not interested.&nbsp;To a borrower, it was a very serious and grave matter.&nbsp; The house would probably be auctioned off at a low price, especially in a depressed market, and the borrower would get practically nothing from the auction proceeds.&nbsp; All his family's life-long savings would have been wiped out, and they are left without a roof over their heads.&nbsp;I am aware that this is a commercial decision for banks and financial institutions to make.&nbsp; But I hope that they could exercise flexibility and consideration in handling borrowers' personal loans so that genuine cases are given a needed help.&nbsp;I hope that MAS will convey this request to the banks and financial institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that MAS will also look at this from the viewpoint of legislation or guideline.&nbsp; Although I have discussed this issue with the housing loan as an example, this appeal for new flexibility and consideration for the borrower applies to all personal loans, including credit card debts.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They feedback that the courses tend to be general and theoretical and do not cultivate a life changing habit.&nbsp; They wanted closer guidance and skills to improve their lives but one-off seminar that aims at quantity rather than quality, just would not do. Like this year's Budget that targets at giving more to those who need most, MoneySENSE perhaps could focus on qualitative programmes that target at in-depth skills acquisition and paradigm shifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some strategic focus I would suggest would be to look at capacity building within the people sector and that includes NGOs, VWOs, Family Service Centres (FSCs), social enterprises where there are ready and needy clients, and do train a training programme that imparts financial literacy or planning skills to counsellors to provide a more holistic approach to help the needy or distressed.&nbsp; We all know that financial concerns can often destabilise a person or family, leading to disorientation, loss of jobs and eventually some poverty cycles.&nbsp; Such programmes may cost more but certainly achieve a better long-term impact on the individual, the family and, of course, the society at large.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, inculcating the right sense of money value system and financial literacy in younger children today could help groom a generation of financially savvy youths who are also prudent.&nbsp; This would help prevent Singapore from becoming a nation of debtors - with overstretched consumers whose cashflow overwhelms inflow, leaving very little for the rainy day or retirement funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, in view of the ageing population and falling fertility rate, perhaps more efforts to intensify retirement planning, adopting a holistic approach and raise awareness on the need to supplement CPF funds and possible alternatives.&nbsp; What is the budget set aside for this year and what would&nbsp;the focus and funding principles be?&nbsp; Would MOF also consider full&nbsp;funding for MoneySENSE programme?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>4.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our efforts over the years, particularly in recent years, we now have a critical mass of financial players in&nbsp;Singapore which, in turn, brings in new financial players.&nbsp; It feeds on itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a reputation that is a very strong one to be a well regulated centre, high standards but also&nbsp;responsive to businesses.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are always well-regulated with high standards, but we are now also known to be quite responsive to businesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are two&nbsp;quite important advantages that we are&nbsp;leveraging on, not just to grow the existing businesses&nbsp;but, as&nbsp;Miss Penny Low says, to develop new niche areas where&nbsp;reliability and rule&nbsp;of law give us a critical advantage.&nbsp; I will highlight just a few areas because of shortage of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, asset management or the wealth management industry broadly, where we already have&nbsp;a leading position in Asia.&nbsp; We are growing not just the volumes, which the Prime Minister had mentioned earlier, ie, double-digit growth over the past five years, but we are also growing new activities.&nbsp; We now have leading fund managers who base management of global mandates out of Singapore, such as in fixed income and emerging markets and in other areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are looking to broaden the range of activities that exists on the fund management value chain, not just the front end of investment management, but the whole range of associated services in the fund management industry, eg,&nbsp;research, trading as well as&nbsp;asset servicing&nbsp;operations.&nbsp; Asset servicing, in particular, is an area we are placing some importance on, and that is why this year's Budget included an incentive to encourage funds to domicile in Singapore, instead of Dublin, Luxembourg, Cayman Islands and so on, so as to be able to develop the asset servicing industry, such as fund administration, fund registration, valuation and accounting, fund listing and, importantly, custody services.&nbsp; It is an important part of the value chain, not as sexy as investment management, but there is a lot of money to be made.&nbsp; We see industry interest in this following the conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with India.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;interest in having funds domiciled in Singapore and being used as a launching pad for investments into India to take advantage of CECA.&nbsp; We are also seeing interest from the Middle East.&nbsp; Middle Eastern investors are feeling more comfortable with funds that are set up and registered in Singapore.&nbsp; So, again, our reputation is a credible one and it is proving to have commercial advantage.&nbsp; This is a piece of the asset management value chain that we are keen to develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area in the broad wealth management industry, which Miss Penny Low mentioned, is philanthropic services, and more broadly, the trust business.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a growth business in Asia especially.&nbsp; We know the whole new wave of wealth that is being created, but we are also seeing a growing number of individuals who are keen on investing in worthy causes.&nbsp; Again, our reputation for rule of law and our reliability confers us an advantage.&nbsp; So growth of philanthropic services is one of the areas we are looking into, and it is aided by our broader initiatives to develop the trust industry, which is a common vehicle used for philanthropic services.&nbsp; So we have modernised our trust laws.&nbsp; As you know, we are updating our regulatory framework for trust companies and we have made our tax regime much more conducive for the growth of the trust business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micro-finance is another area that Miss Penny Low mentioned which we are looking into.&nbsp; I do not know very much about it myself, but I agree with her description of the industry.&nbsp; It is growing rapidly.&nbsp; Big players like Citibank as well as smaller niche players are getting into this market and it is something we are keen to look at to see whether we can play a useful role in the regional as well as broader Asian context, including India.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capital markets, we already have some strengths.&nbsp; In particular, we are one of the&nbsp;leading stock index futures markets.&nbsp; The warrants market has also taken off very well&nbsp;in the last two years.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;looking ahead now at new areas, and equity derivatives is one important new area of&nbsp;growth.&nbsp; In the Asian markets, it is starting from a very low base but with high prospects for growth, as has happened in Europe and the United States.&nbsp; The Singapore Investment Banking Association (SIBA) has been studying&nbsp;ways to develop the equity derivatives market in Singapore very carefully, and MAS is working with the&nbsp;Association on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance is another area where there are niches to be tapped and where we have an advantage.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;already a&nbsp;leading regional reinsurance centre and a captive insurance domicile.&nbsp; But we are in a strong position to develop new niche insurance sectors, such as maritime insurance and credit insurance, given our role as a maritime&nbsp;and trade hub respectively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islamic finance, which Dr Ahmad Magad has spoken about,&nbsp;is an important new niche area, and the&nbsp;Prime Minister had touched on this&nbsp;in his Budget speech.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the regulatory side of things, I would say we take a pro-business approach.&nbsp; It is an evolving market.&nbsp; There are new products coming up.&nbsp; Initially, not everyone understands them, but we want to learn about them quickly and see whether we need to tweak existing regulations to facilitate that growth.&nbsp; It is too early to say that we should set up a whole new edifice to support Islamic finance.&nbsp; The existing regulatory framework is, in fact, quite&nbsp;friendly for Islamic finance.&nbsp; It is able to accommodate most of the new products that have come in.&nbsp; But we are very happy on a product-specific basis, ie, look at the details, see what we need to tweak or amend.&nbsp; That is our approach.&nbsp; Basically, we take a pro-business approach, ie, let the industry come forward with initiatives, and&nbsp;MAS will go forward with them.&nbsp; That is how we have seen the introduction of a whole set of new financial products in the last couple of years, such as <I>Takaful</I> and re-<I>Takaful</I> products, Islamic deposits, Islamic trade financing, and Islamic funds.&nbsp; In September last year, as Dr Ahmad Magad knows, we have fine-tuned our regulations to allow financing based on the <I>Murabaha</I> concept.&nbsp; The Singapore Exchange is also looking into Islamic instruments on the capital markets and the equity markets.&nbsp; We recently launched the first <I>Shari'ah</I>-compliant Pan Asian Equity Islamic index, which should help to grow the&nbsp;<I>Shari'ah</I>-compliant fund management industry, particularly for&nbsp;Asian investors and exposures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will just add, in relation to Dr Ahmad Magad's broader point about the need for education to spread familiarisation of Islamic finance, that we are not aiming primarily for the retail market.&nbsp; We have a small retail market, but it is not going to be sizeable enough to make us a centre for Islamic finance.&nbsp; We are aiming principally at the market for large funds, eg, institutional players and wealthy individuals, many of whom come from the Middle East and other parts of the world.&nbsp; There is a niche for Singapore to tap at that high-end segment of the market, and we have advantages in terms of our reliability, efficiency as well as a whole array of other financial services in Singapore to service that market.&nbsp; But we are not aiming primarily at the retail segment of the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with Dr Ahmad Magad about the importance of manpower development in Islamic finance as well as other areas, in other words, develop professional skills.&nbsp; That is a continuous game.&nbsp; We are stepping up our efforts in that area, otherwise we would not succeed in growing all these niches we are talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are putting in place quite a few initiatives.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we look at our financial training scheme, which is part of the Financial Sector Development Fund (FSDF), and the Financial Training Scheme (FTS) which we started in 2001, we have committed over $8 million as of end of last year&nbsp;to train more than 7,000 industry professionals in specialised areas.&nbsp; So we are trying to deepen our pockets of expertise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Islamic finance, in fact, we have co-funded more than 25 Islamic finance courses for quite a significant number of individuals.&nbsp; We are also looking to develop the financial research industry.&nbsp; In July last year, we launched the $10 million Programme on Risk Management and Financial Innovation to catalyse more research and training in Singapore so that Singapore becomes a hub for research in financial services in Asia.&nbsp; Certainly, Islamic finance will be one area we will be quite keen to encourage more research on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If I can move on to Mr Inderjit Singh and Dr John&nbsp;Chen's questions on alternative platforms in the early stage companies.&nbsp; I agree that we need to do more to spur entrepreneurship.&nbsp; It is a long-term game, but we need to develop the financial markets to try to spur this.&nbsp; It means having a range of financial options, quite apart from venture capital (VC) business, bank loans and some form of mezzanine financing provided by the banks within the range of options in the capital markets not just to develop local enterprise but also make&nbsp;Singapore a centre for funding for Asian enterprises, start-up companies and early stage companies from all over Asia.&nbsp; I think we do have an opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are doing quite well so far.&nbsp; The venture capital business itself is doing quite well.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;about more than $17 billion managed in Singapore and over 160 VC firms set up already.&nbsp; The Singapore Exchange (SGX), through both the&nbsp;Main Board and SESDAQ,&nbsp;now has more flexible admissions criteria, eg,&nbsp;shorter profit record or even&nbsp;no profit track record, subject to other requirements.&nbsp; But it is a lot more flexible and it is up to the standards of the more innovative exchanges internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, SGX&nbsp;announced its intention to introduce Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), which will&nbsp;provide another convenient way&nbsp;for companies from all across Asia already listed on a primary stock exchange in their own country or elsewhere to tap our capital markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should look carefully at the case for new or alternative platforms for early stage companies.&nbsp; There are a number of trends that support this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there is a wave of enterprise creation across Asia, many more new companies being formed, small companies that do not have traditional capital markets very well suited to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a case that is being built up by this new wave enterprise creation in Singapore as well as across Asia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, interestingly, there is now increased allocation on the part of global portfolio investors to the emerging markets and to higher-risk opportunities.&nbsp; They want to diversify, enhance their returns and to extract alpha in the financial markets, and they are looking at emerging market opportunities, including private equity and other forms of emerging investments.&nbsp; So there are fundamental trends that are driving this.&nbsp; We are not going to rush.&nbsp; We want to study this carefully to make sure that whatever we do is based on business viability and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the status of the private equity or OTC exchange.&nbsp; Members would know that in October last year, we amended our securities laws to provide for two new \"safe harbours\" in the Securities and Futures Act to allow private placements and small offers to be made without a prospectus.&nbsp; We are now seeing industry interest.&nbsp; Phillip Securities, as Mr Inderjit Singh knows, is in discussion with MAS on its plan to develop an OTC platform to facilitate trading in shares of SMEs that are not publicly listed to take advantage of these \"safe harbours\".&nbsp; It is a good proposal, and Phillip Securities is now putting in place the necessary capabilities.&nbsp; MAS does not usually announce approval until everything is ready and I am not about to&nbsp;today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr John Chen also asked about a third Board, which is another interesting possibility to allow start-ups to raise funds, and I agree we should look at this.&nbsp; GEMS in Hong Kong may not be the best example.&nbsp; In fact, GEMS has had a rather poor record in recent years, and they are now taking a fundamental relook at GEMS in Hong Kong.&nbsp; They have a public consultation paper to see how they should go forward because the existing formula has not worked.&nbsp; A better model worth careful scrutiny is Alternative Investment Market (AIM) which is offered by the London Stock Exchange.&nbsp; It is doing very well.&nbsp; AIM allows companies to access capital at the early stage of development before they become ready for full public listing.&nbsp; And they do it by doing away with most traditional listing requirements but relying instead on&nbsp; nominated advisers, or \"Nomads\" as they are called, who take&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;for coordinating the admission process and in carrying out due diligence to ensure that the company is suitable for an AIM listing.&nbsp; In other words, rather than set up <I>ex ante</I> listing barriers, they rely on the Nomads and the credibility of the Nomads to attest to the company's readiness.&nbsp; So the success of AIM rests on this pool of expertise that they have in London, expertise in the Nomads to be able to vet, scrutinise and give some assurance about the company's readiness.&nbsp; It also rests, I should say, on certain tax incentives that are peculiar to Britain.&nbsp; They have high capital gains and inheritance taxes, so they give tax incentives to British investors in the AIM market which has provided a bit of a spur relative to traditional capital market instruments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX is currently studying the business case for alternative platforms or financing for start-up companies.&nbsp; MAS' current regulatory framework can&nbsp;broadly accommodate the setting up of these new platforms,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the industry must first make its own&nbsp;assessment as to what is commercially viable in the local and Asian contexts.&nbsp; If the financial industry considers a specific proposal to be viable, MAS will look at the specifics and see whether amendments are required to our regulations so as to facilitate the introduction of any such platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.00&nbsp;pm<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon&nbsp;Wan had asked</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>whether&nbsp;financial institutions can show&nbsp;borrowers more flexibility in settling their debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me first say that the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in Singapore is very low, particularly by international standards.&nbsp; Our NPL ratio for&nbsp;all types of loans is&nbsp;less than 5%&nbsp;and for mortgage loans it is less than&nbsp;2%.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;for owner-occupied mortgage loans, it will be below 2%.&nbsp; What&nbsp;this basically reflects is that risk management is working in Singapore.&nbsp; I do not think it is a situation, as Dr Tan describes, where&nbsp;banks simply willy-nilly grant&nbsp;loans as long as someone has met the minimum requirement. We do have more than a modicum of&nbsp;risk management in place in our banks, and MAS ensures that this is the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens when borrowers cannot&nbsp;meet their loan instalments? Banks do not immediately foreclose. They will undertake some form of remedial action first and, particularly for owner-occupied housing loans, they go through great pains to take remedial action, giving the borrowers more time to pay or restructuring the loan so as to reduce the immediate debt servicing burden and spread it out over several years. This is the norm&nbsp;in fact for mortgage loans as with other loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks&nbsp;have an interest in doing so, because&nbsp;no bank&nbsp;wants to have a reputation of being quick to pull&nbsp;the plug as soon as a borrower runs into trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, decisions on debt recovery and foreclosures are commercial ones and MAS has to leave it to&nbsp;banks to decide on these things.&nbsp; But what&nbsp;MAS has done, and will continue to do, is to check that banks have robust and careful credit&nbsp;assessment procedures in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will help minimise the number of borrowers who over-commit themselves to loans, enter into loans that are beyond their capacity to repay realistically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these safeguards, there will remain a small percentage of borrowers who have serious problems in managing their debts.&nbsp; Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS), which Assoc. Prof. Ong&nbsp;Soh Khim had asked about earlier, can help these individuals through credit counselling and, where applicable, assist them to work out a debt repayment plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a useful role which MAS and the&nbsp;banks recognise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Borrowers ultimately will have to play their part,&nbsp;carefully assessing their own ability to service a loan before they commit to it. That is fundamental.&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to Miss Penny Low's last question on financial education. She made some useful&nbsp;suggestions on what we can do to raise financial literacy among Singaporeans&nbsp;- to go beyond generic messages to specific messages, and to go beyond quantity of programmes to quality of programmes.&nbsp; I quite agree with her.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;stepping up MoneySENSE and, in particular, we are trying to find ways to reach into the neighbourhoods.&nbsp; This means working with community organisations. I agree that we have to look at capacity building in our community organisations.&nbsp; One important initiative that is being undertaken right now involves MoneySENSE working with the five CDCs to run a basic money management workshop for low-income families. These are often families that have been referred to the CDCs in the first instance because they have got financial difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We can improve quality, I am sure.&nbsp; The CDCs are, in fact, building up their capabilities in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;South East CDC has implemented a three month train-the-trainer workshop for CDC officers and family service centre (FSC) social workers. They did this in&nbsp;October last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good initiative, providing the trainers first with knowledge of how to run a basic money management workshop, but also on how to follow up with families subsequently to make sure that they understand how to design a family budget and stick to it. Some consistent advice is required over a&nbsp;period&nbsp;of weeks and months. That is what we found.&nbsp; So it is a good approach, training the trainers, and it will have&nbsp;a multiplier effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a long-term effort. We have been doing this for a few years now, mainly national messages, reaching out through the mass media. We are now penetrating the neighbourhoods, working with grassroots organisations and we have to do more in that area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, the Minister of State, Mrs Lim, did not address my question in her answer.&nbsp;If she cannot tell us what is the investment return,&nbsp;can she at least inform us&nbsp;how much&nbsp;our assets have actually grown up to now?&nbsp; How many hundreds of billions in our assets are we talking about&nbsp;at this point of time?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I believe I have actually answered that.&nbsp; But let me just reiterate for the benefit of Mr Chia that we have explained on numerous occasions that the disclosure of such information is really not in our national interest.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Is the disclosure&nbsp;in terms of the returns or the total assets?&nbsp; If&nbsp;she cannot tell us what is the rate of return,&nbsp;at least tell us what are the assets at this point.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Sir, let me just repeat what I have just said.&nbsp; For the exact size and returns of our investments, we have explained that the disclosure is not in our national interest.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chia, you have got your&nbsp;answer.

We should focus the Auditor-General on big ticket items.&nbsp; Let us learn from other jurisdictions, such as Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the UK. For instance, the duties of the Auditor-General of Australia are to report on the performance and financial management of the government. Two recent reports focus on the effectiveness of the government in, one,&nbsp;administering quarantine and, two, the Australian Armed Forces' upgrade of its M113 armoured personnel carriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I have another example - the UK National Audit Office's report on,&nbsp;I quote, \"The economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the government\". Presently, the officers are preparing a report on the lessons from the merger of five existing regulatory bodies into off-com.&nbsp; The UK National Audit Office hopes to identify good practices to guide future mergers of government agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, our Auditor-General catches a few thousand dollars worth of late payments and some missing invoices.&nbsp; This misses the wood for the trees. The really big ticket items on which we should focus are questions of how to ensure value for money in Government expenditure, questions like how much the market&nbsp;value of an HDB block increases for every $1 million spent on upgrading and&nbsp;utilisation of Government buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, we note here in Parliament that&nbsp;we have an auditorium. Across the street, in the Supreme Court, they have an auditorium. Around the block, at the Treasury building, there is another auditorium. There are a lot of auditoriums all within a 100-metres of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other big ticket items&nbsp;like what is value add of the billions we have spent on economic incentives to multi-national and domestic companies?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us focus the Auditor-General on the big ticket items, issues of value for money.&nbsp; Let us focus on dollars and not cents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Sir, let me first thank the Member for his comments and suggestions.&nbsp; I wish to inform him and the House that&nbsp;audits are only a part of the Government's overall efforts to achieve value for money in public spending.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my speech earlier on this afternoon under Head M, the Government's&nbsp;philosophy is to exercise prudence in spending and to deliver more for the dollar as a standing demand on all Government agencies. &nbsp;While some other jurisdictions, as those cited by the Member, may choose to focus on what we call <I>ex-post</I> audits to check excesses and inefficiencies, in Singapore, we aim&nbsp;to achieve value for money proactively at various levels as a matter of habit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just elaborate.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, at the agency level, there is management oversight on spending that is guided by Government-wide principles of effective budgeting, awareness of value in public spending and efficiency in operations. The PS21 (Public Service in&nbsp;the 21st Century) movement drives the whole public sector to productivity, quality service and organisational excellence.&nbsp; The block budget system which sets caps on Ministries' spending as a percentage of GDP, the Economy Drive initiative which requires Ministries to strive for cost savings, and market testing and best-sourcing of non-core functions are all&nbsp;important ways by which the Government seeks to enhance efficiency and reduce costs in the public sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, all Ministries today have internal audit functions. In addition, the Accountant-General's Department assists the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in looking out for issues relating to efficiency in operations and excesses in spending. As an example of tightening up on spending, the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;introduced in 2003 the requirement for statutory boards to refer all projects above $50 million to MOF for clearance, whereas previously statutory boards were free to proceed on their own if they did not need grants from the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centrally, MOF has also initiated and will continue to initiate a consolidation and standardisation of processes for economies of scale.&nbsp; Let me just quote three examples.&nbsp; The first is the shared services centre for the conduct of HR and finance services.&nbsp; The second is the standard operating environment for a common platform for info-comm technology across all the Ministries.

If I may, Sir, I would like to speak on the topic of legal aid and the opportunities that people have for legal representation.&nbsp; Before doing so, I should like to declare my interest as a practising lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, a person is only eligible for legal aid if, (i) the applicant's disposal capital is not more than $7,000, or (ii) the applicant's disposal income does not exceed $10,000 per annum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at the disposal income requirement, this works out to something like approximately $900 a month for the past year and that is quite a high threshold.&nbsp; The Director of Legal Aid has no discretion to vary this.&nbsp; The Minister can authorise the Director to grant legal aid if the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that legal aid be granted to a particular person, but the Director himself has got no discretion.&nbsp; There are, of course, very few instances where the issue may be of public interest, but it is important to the individual in question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many instances where a person may earn more than $900 a month, but not very much more than that, and yet still need legal aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of a housewife who gets maintenance.&nbsp; Let us say she gets $1,000 a month.&nbsp; That works out to about $12,000 a year.&nbsp; She would not meet the legal aid criterion.&nbsp; But if, for some reasons, her husband cuts off her maintenance and then there is an issue in dispute and she needs to litigate that, she would not qualify for legal aid.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry would consider amending the Act to look not so much at the income for the past year - because people who fall into this income group, if&nbsp;they are earning something like about $1,000 or $1,200 a month, chances are&nbsp;they would not have much savings anyway - but at the person's current means to determine whether&nbsp;he or she can really afford legal representation at this particular point in time.&nbsp; And, if they cannot, then&nbsp;we can&nbsp;consider extending legal aid to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question I would like to ask&nbsp;is&nbsp;whether the Government would consider extending legal aid to cover criminal matters.&nbsp; At present, the Act does not extend it&nbsp;to cover criminal matters.&nbsp; In fact, for criminal matters what they do is they go to the Law Society which has a criminal legal aid scheme.&nbsp; But that is a volunteer scheme.&nbsp; It just seems a little odd&nbsp;that for something as serious as a criminal charge, these persons would have to actually depend on a volunteer scheme.&nbsp; So I wonder if the Government might extend the scope of legal aid to cover criminal matters as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, the issue of bankruptcy has been highlighted over the last year or so.&nbsp; We use to think that bankruptcy involves only people who are affected by business failures.&nbsp; However, as we learned last year, 90% of bankruptcy cases involved non-business related reasons, the majority&nbsp;are due to over-spending on credit facilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has also been asked about the regulations governing the issuance of credit facilities by financial institutions.&nbsp; It is agreed that, at the end of the day, it is the responsibility of the individual to honour his contractual&nbsp;obligations when he takes up these facilities or loans.&nbsp; At the same time, however, I think we must also ensure that the financial institutions also exercise their own corporate and social responsibility when granting these credit facilities.&nbsp; We have heard of MAS' guidelines that&nbsp;say that they leave it to the market to find its own equilibrium.&nbsp; But observation of the&nbsp;aggressive marketing strategies undertaken by some of these financial institutions suggests that their profit-orientation may overshadow their social responsibility.&nbsp; If&nbsp; I&nbsp;may say, it is rightfully so, as it is not their core business to be socially responsible.&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the concern I have is that the young and impressionable are certainly vulnerable.&nbsp; It is not uncommon for a fresh graduate to receive applications of credit cards and line of credit upon graduation.&nbsp; Some of these are even pre-approved.&nbsp; The most impressionable will, in no time, end up with a couple of credit cards and unsecured loans.&nbsp; Car loans are also easy to come by these days.&nbsp; The lower income is not spared either.&nbsp; Loans in the form of hire purchases are very common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, statistics given in this House thus far indicate that the majority, about 70% of the bankrupts, are&nbsp;between 31 and 50 years old.&nbsp; However, if we look further, at the younger age group - below 40 years old - the proportion is about 43%.&nbsp; At this age group, one would assume, if they are married, they have dependants.&nbsp; They probably have elderly dependants to support too.&nbsp; Sir, it will take a long time for them to get back on their feet if they are declared bankrupt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister, amongst those who are non-business related bankrupt petitions last year, what is the breakdown between those who filed for&nbsp;bankruptcy themselves and those who faced bankruptcy petitions against them by financial institutions.&nbsp; Can the Ministry give us&nbsp;the age and education profile of these cases for the last year and an assessment if the trend is more prevalent amongst young educated who actually are asking for bankruptcy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister&nbsp;for Law also mentioned last year that the Official Assignee's Office (OA) had set up a self-petition management team to closely monitor the self-petition bankrupts.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to give an update of the work of this team and what their findings have thus far been.&nbsp; This is important as we must ensure that those who self-petition, do not do so under the false illusion that they can get away without&nbsp;paying their debts.&nbsp; They may not know the strict obligations of a bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act, for example, there are travelling restrictions, making contracts, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important is whether this team in OA's office can develop a preventive education programme to teach vulnerable groups on what they need to do to avoid bankruptcy, and at the same time manage their debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that IPTO has also set up a pre-bankruptcy mediation centre in 2002 to encourage creditors and debtors to enter into mutually acceptable debt arrangements to&nbsp;avoid bankruptcy.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how successful has&nbsp;this centre&nbsp;been in helping these pre-bankruptcy cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;for an update on the omnibus Insolvency Legislation Act that was proposed last year by the Committee tasked to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

While bankruptcy may be the most practical legal resolution in many cases, where debtors are clearly unable to pay their debts, it has its downsides.&nbsp; It is certainly not something that we, as a society, encourage for all cases.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister whether bankruptcy figures are beginning to show signs of abating and, if so, what factors contribute to this.&nbsp; Like my colleague, Dr Maliki, I wish to ask the Minister for the progress on the pre-bankruptcy mechanism that was instituted a couple of years ago, how successful has it been and whether improvements can still be made to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Intellectual Property</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I understand that the World Intellectual Property Organisation Diplomatic Conference would be held here in Singapore later this month.&nbsp; Can the Minister inform us what is the significance of this conference being held here?&nbsp; How else can Singaporeans benefit from the IT industry?&nbsp; If there is much benefit, can the Ministry do more to encourage professionals such as lawyers, to include intellectual property in their practices?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Such a measure would contribute not only to enhance business efficiency but also further reduce business cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, good electronic record-keeping requires planning and budgeting for data migration and conversion as well as complying with laws and regulations on how to retain business records.&nbsp; Keeping records over a long period can be costly if they are not properly maintained and managed, especially if the records become a subject of litigation.&nbsp; However, with the current state of electronic storage technology, I feel that it would be more cost effective and efficient if companies are provided this option by law to store their records electronically.&nbsp; The key to it is to ensure that the proper legal framework is put in place, including annual audit requirements to ascertain that companies adopting this option are in proper compliance.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Members who have spoken.&nbsp; I will answer the questions on legal aid and bankruptcy and my colleague, Senior Minister of State, will take the questions on intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on legal aid.&nbsp; The Member, Ms Indranee Rajah, spoke about the many instances where some people who are in need of legal aid&nbsp;will not qualify&nbsp;under our current criteria.&nbsp; But I need to put matters into context.&nbsp;The approach of looking at the disposable income for the previous year is one that is used in other jurisdiction.&nbsp; Also, to put matters into context, for the past three years, at least 90% of the applicants for legal aid actually have satisfied the means test.&nbsp; For the first&nbsp;10 months of last year, the figure went up to 94%.&nbsp; So only a small number of people do not meet the financial eligibility criteria for legal aid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am sympathetic to her point, which is that we may come across some cases, from time to time, which may be deserving of legal aid, but because of the provisions and the criteria they may not be able to receive legal aid from the Legal Aid Bureau.&nbsp; From the figures I have given, I think the overall system and the means test&nbsp;are working.&nbsp;&nbsp;What she is arguing for is really some flexibility to deal with such cases.&nbsp; I will discuss with the Director of Legal Aid to examine how we can work into the system some flexibility or discretion to deal with the real hardship cases, for example, where the person has lost his job and is facing an array of civil actions but whose past income falls outside the criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;We come across it in our meet-the-people sessions.&nbsp; So, we will look into her suggestions to see how we can put some flexibility without radically changing the overall system.&nbsp; I should add that those who do not satisfy the means test are not really left without recourse because the Legal Aid Bureau does refer them to the many other avenues for legal assistance such as the many free legal clinics that are run by voluntary groups elsewhere in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point she made in&nbsp;the closing part of her intervention was about criminal legal aid and whether we consider extending it.&nbsp; In the limited time we have today, I do not want to go into details.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has been explained in this House on several occasions as to why the State cannot, on the one hand,&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

But if the Member feels strongly about the position taken by the Government on this issue&nbsp;other than for capital cases where, of course, we provide legal assistance, then she could pursue this either in a Question for oral answer or in an Adjournment Motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the two questions on bankruptcy by Dr Mohamad Maliki and Mr Ahmad Khalis.&nbsp; Let me first deal with the request for information on the trends of bankruptcy.&nbsp; The fact is that the numbers have come down.&nbsp; In 2005, there were 4,078 bankruptcy petitions.&nbsp; This was a drop of about 20% compared to the previous year.&nbsp; Correspondingly, the number of bankruptcy orders by the High Court has also decreased to 3,542, which is a&nbsp;drop of 22%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was asked about the profiles.&nbsp; The majority are in the age range of 41-50 years.&nbsp; The second highest group is the age group of 31-40 years.&nbsp; The age group of 41-50 years also accounts for almost 40% of new bankrupts in 2004 and 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was asked about self-petitions.&nbsp; Most of the bankrupts were made bankrupt by creditors.&nbsp; I am glad to say that the self-petition cases are a very small percentage&nbsp;at 4.3% in 2004, and it came down in 2005 to 2.7%.&nbsp; Of these self-petition cases in 2005, the age group of 31-40 years accounts for 46%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main cause of insolvency cited by non-business related bankrupts, including in self-petition cases, is really credit card debts.&nbsp; Other causes included default in payment of other credit facilities, losses incurred&nbsp;from speculation, suffering from ill health or standing as a guarantor for various loans and&nbsp;situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki asked for an update of the self-petition management team set up by the Official Assignee.&nbsp; I am glad to say that through the efforts of this team, the number of self-petition cases has dropped in the past year.&nbsp; In terms of absolute numbers, the number of self-petition cases dropped by 33%, from 941 cases in 2004 to 632 cases in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also asked what&nbsp;we&nbsp;are doing about bankruptcies among younger people.&nbsp; As a percentage of all new bankrupts, those from the 21-30 years age group has risen marginally, from 9.4% in 2004 to 9.9% last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that young people are able to manage their personal finances, the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office has recently,&nbsp;with institutions of higher learning like the Singapore Polytechnic,&nbsp;organised consumer education talks.&nbsp; And the objective of these talks is to create awareness and promote the importance of financial planning.&nbsp; We hope that these will bear fruit in reducing the incidence of bankruptcies amongst younger people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also asked about&nbsp;pre-bankruptcy efforts and the success of the pre-bankruptcy and mediation centre.&nbsp; In 2005 alone, about 2,100 debtors turned to the centre for information and advice.&nbsp; They also handled 15 mediation cases, of which four were successfully resolved to the satisfaction of both creditors and debtors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked whether there is any mechanism for negotiation between debtors and creditors in place.&nbsp; Dr Maliki also asked&nbsp;whether the centre can do more and whether we could pay more attention to the plight of&nbsp;bankrupts in the middle income group.&nbsp; In addition to the efforts by the centre, let me touch on the recommendation by the Omnibus Insolvency Legislation Committee, which I spoke about last year.&nbsp; The Committee found that our current bankruptcy regime does not provide sufficient avenues for the debtor to negotiate a settlement with his creditors to avoid bankruptcy.&nbsp; The Committee has recommended a simpler pre-bankruptcy procedure for the individual debtor who is capable of repaying his debts.&nbsp; They identified Chapter 13 of the US Bankruptcy Code as a workable model.&nbsp; It provides a framework for reorganisation proceedings to allow individual debtors to enter into repayment plans with creditors to pay off the debts over a few years.&nbsp; The Committee now recommends a wage reorganisation scheme that is based on the US Chapter 13 with some modifications to meet our local needs.&nbsp; The trigger point for the scheme would be when a statutory demand is served on the debtor by one of his creditors, or when a debtor self-petitions for bankruptcy.&nbsp; If the statutory demand is not complied with or set aside within 21 days, the debtor must enter into a wage reorganisation scheme.&nbsp; And the debtor who intends to petition for his own bankruptcy will also be subjected to the proposed wage reorganisation scheme.&nbsp; Under the scheme, the debtor must complete his repayment plan within 3-5 years.&nbsp; When payments under the plan have been completed, the debtor will be released from his obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is now studying this recommendation and consulting some stakeholders to see if such a scheme can work in cases where, for example, the size of the debts&nbsp;is within practical limits for wage earners, such as $100,000 and below.&nbsp; I think if the scheme works, it will achieve a win-win outcome for both debtors and creditors.&nbsp; A debtor will be able to stave off consequences of bankruptcy, be more likely to remain in gainful employment and thus be in a better position to repay his debts.&nbsp; It also benefits the creditors who can then recover more of the debt which would otherwise have to be written off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my Senior Minister of State will deal with the other issues.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc.

Also many MNCs have chosen Singapore as a base to manage and license their IP in the region.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khalis asked how Singaporeans have benefited from our robust IP regime.&nbsp; Sir, this regime is a key factor in drawing IP intensive companies to Singapore.&nbsp; And these knowledge-based companies provide a boost to our economy and also create value-added jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sound IP regime, therefore, has helped to create a conducive environment for nurturing home-grown innovations and creative activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;our copyright regime has helped protect the livelihood of home-grown creative talents, such as film makers, Jack Neo and Eric Khoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the&nbsp;patent front, patent applications filed by&nbsp;Singapore-based entities in the US, a major market, nearly doubled from 460 in 1999 to 880 in 2004.&nbsp; In addition, the number of local filings here in&nbsp;Singapore by Singapore entities rose from 523 in 2002 to 675 in 2004.&nbsp; Also, the number of registered patent agents has grown from 69 in 2002 to 99 today.&nbsp; Therefore, inventors who want to file their patents are not facing hurdles or exorbitant cost.&nbsp; In any case, there are funds, such as EDB-administered Patent Application Fund, to which inventors who need help can turn to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as to what more can be done to encourage practising lawyers and other professionals to include IP in their practices, I think the key driver must be the demand for IP services.&nbsp; In fact, the growth of IP intensive industries in Singapore and increasing IP awareness of local firms have spurred the growth of the IP service sector.&nbsp; Beyond IP legal services, new IP consultancies and specialist boutique firms have emerged to offer services, such as IP commercialisation, brand management and IP intelligence as a strategic business too.&nbsp; The IP Academy plays its part by organising key events, such as courses and also research projects and joint events with key partners, both here and overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, the demand for IP services here&nbsp;is expected to rise, as we double our total R&amp;D expenditure over the next five years.&nbsp; In effect, in a 2005 IPOS survey, seven out of 10 IP service providers were optimistic that the IP industry will continue to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) will build up higher value specialist IP expertise, such as patent agency services.&nbsp; There are also other financial support schemes to help companies defray the cost of IP manpower development.&nbsp; For example, there is another EDB scheme called INTECH. INTECH has supported 62 professions over the last three years to undergo training in patent drafting and IP licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Singapore companies internationalise, our IP service providers would need to be savvy about foreign IP regimes.&nbsp; IPOS will facilitate this by continuing to organise conferences with major IP offices, such as the upcoming conference on China's IP regime with the state IP Office of China.&nbsp; And also the establishment of a WIPO office in Singapore last year, which is the first outside the US and Europe, will further create opportunities for knowledge networking among local and overseas IP experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the WIPO diplomatic conference that Singapore will host, which Mr Khalis mentioned, in March this year over about 19 days, is significant for us because it will be the first IP diplomatic conference to be held in Asia.&nbsp; More importantly, it signals Singapore's commitment to contributing to the development of an international IP framework.&nbsp; And this conference will provide a platform for knowledge exchange amongst several hundred IP experts from 183 countries to finalise revisions to the 1994 Trademark Law Treaty, which&nbsp;is expected to result in cheaper and more efficient trademark registration procedures for businesses globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Sir, we have made good progress in creating a conducive environment for IP creation, protection and commercialisation.&nbsp; Going forward, we will ensure that our IP regime remains dynamic and forward looking in support of our innovation-driven economy.&nbsp; We will also step up efforts to foster greater IP awareness amongst our businesses and facilitate IP manpower capability development.&nbsp; Finally, we will continue to raise Singapore's profile in the international IP arena to increase our attractiveness as a place for IP intensive activities.&nbsp; So, that summarises our approach, which has worked well and we will press on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to Dr Magad's cut on electronic record-keeping.&nbsp; At the outset, I agree with the Member that businesses that keep their records and documents electronically can enhance their efficiency and reduce their business cost.&nbsp; A good example is NTUC which last year converted 40 million pages of documents into electronic images, a move that will save NTUC&nbsp;$10 million a year when fully implemented.&nbsp; This conversion, which was done under a certified process in compliance with the Evidence Act, has paved the way for NTUC to redesign its work processes and to achieve greater efficiency and productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Evidence Act provides a legal framework where electronic documents, produced under a process which has been approved by a certifying authority, will be admissible as evidence in court.&nbsp; And to ensure that the integrity of the process is maintained, the process has to be certified once every year for the first three years, and thereafter once every two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Dr Magad rightly points out, a proper legal framework, including audit requirements, is required to facilitate certainty and compliance, and this is provided for under the Evidence Act.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I will speak on the topic of security and crime.&nbsp; I note that there was an increase in the crime rate for last year by 19.9%, including&nbsp;all but one of the index crimes.&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask the Minister the reasons for the increase in the crime rate,&nbsp;what measures have been taken to address this&nbsp;and also whether he sees any particular trend arising from this increased crime rate and, if so, how this trend should be dealt with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also particularly concerned about the increase in violent crimes.&nbsp; To be fair, I am actually referring to two instances of violent crimes.&nbsp; But in&nbsp;a place like Singapore, where there are so few instances of violent crimes, each single one appears to be all the more shocking when it occurs.&nbsp; Recently, there was&nbsp;an incident reported in the newspapers of a 59-year-old man who had in an attempted robbery discharged a gun, and then of course more recently the murder of a nightclub owner who was shot five times.&nbsp; The suspect, we understand from the newspapers, has now been arrested in Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether these incidents are indicative of any trend in violent crimes or whether the Police think that these are simply one-off incidents.&nbsp; I ask because I have a concern that there may be copycat crimes.&nbsp; Certainly, we do not have that phenomenon here in Singapore as badly as it occurs in the US.&nbsp; But there is cause for concern because such incidents could give other criminals ideas.&nbsp; Also, these two particular crimes&nbsp;highlight something&nbsp;which, to me, has a wider implication, in terms of security in general and, in particular, in relation to terrorism.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first aspect was the use of guns in these two incidents.&nbsp; The first incident, from what I understand, is that the gun had been around for a long time.&nbsp; So, that is not too much a problem.&nbsp; But in the second incident, it is not being indicated publicly the origin or the source of the gun.&nbsp; I am not asking for that because I understand&nbsp;that the matter is still under investigation and that information would probably have to be withheld.&nbsp; But the point I want to highlight though is the fact that the presence of&nbsp;a gun means that there is the possibility or&nbsp;availability of arms or explosives in Singapore.&nbsp; And this has, of course, some bearing on our general security climate and security concerns, especially in relation to terrorism.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister what kind of measures or controls we have in place to minimise the risks of materials that could be used to make bombs, or any other kind of dangerous materials that could be used for terrorist acts, from being brought into Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point that arises out of these crimes but with an impact on the wider security picture is the checkpoint security.&nbsp; In the case of the nightclub owner murder, the suspect was able to escape because the family of the victim was unable to give a description of the suspect until sometime after the incident.&nbsp; Again, I do not have any criticism here of the speed with which the authorities reacted.&nbsp; But the point I am highlighting is, in the event that an incident occurs, whether it is a terrorist incident or some other incident, what kind of measures do we have to deal with checkpoint security, how fast and how quickly can we secure our borders in the event that something happens, how do we react, in terms of border control, in the event that an incident like this occurs?&nbsp; Also, for terrorist attacks, it depends on the nature of the attack. If it is a suicide attack, the immediate perpetrator obviously would be dead or likely to be badly injured.&nbsp; But there may be people who assist them.&nbsp; So these people may seek to escape.&nbsp; The question is, how tight is our border control?&nbsp;On the reverse side, there is also a situation where potential terrorists might come into Singapore.&nbsp; So I wish to know what kind of measures do we have to deal with that and to prevent such people from coming into Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite apart from terrorists coming into Singapore, the London bombings in the middle of last year highlighted another new phenomenon which is that of home-grown terrorists, and that is a disturbing new development in the area of terrorism.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for his views on whether there is a potential danger of home-grown Singapore terrorists and, again, if so, what kind of measures are being taken to address this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, on a bigger security picture, I would like to ask the Minister what lessons we have learnt from the London bombings and how we can apply what has been learnt from those lessons to improve our security preparedness in Singapore.&nbsp; Also, I would like to ask him what is the current status of our preparedness to deal with terrorist attacks in Singapore.&nbsp; What have we learnt from the NorthStar operation?&nbsp; Will we be having more such exercises and what, in general, can the members of the public in Singapore do to assist the Home Team in dealing with potential terrorist attacks and homeland security?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Homeland Security</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade):</B>&nbsp; Terrorism continues to be a serious concern globally, and, regionally, terrorism makes a serious concern for many governments.&nbsp;Sir, I am impressed that the Home Team, together with the Ministry of Defence and the National Security Coordination Centre, has taken various measures to harden Singapore as a target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to compliment the Minister for the efforts taken by the Ministry in having public exercises which prepare Singapore and also non-public exercises to make our agencies more efficient and well-prepared. I would like to ask the Minister, given the fact that there are concerns in the region about terrorist acts, particularly with the report that there is a breakaway faction from the JI which has now emerged, what is the assessment of the Ministry as far as terrorist threat is concerned, both in the region and within Singapore.&nbsp; Secondly, what is the state of cooperation between the Police agencies and the intelligence agencies&nbsp;of Singapore and the neighbouring countries?&nbsp; Thirdly, what are the measures that have been taken within Singapore to prepare Singaporeans to react in a manner that we would like them to react in an event of a terrorist attack?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Replacing NRIC</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I think it is about time that we adopted a more intelligent identity card, and it is opportune now in the light of the threat of terrorism.&nbsp; Take, for example, the security of our office buildings.&nbsp; From time to time, I have to visit other offices for meetings.&nbsp; I notice that the security checks at these buildings range from non-existent, which is not satisfactory for security reasons, to having a manual register that visitors have to fill in their particulars,&nbsp;and I have seen people writing names like Superman and Wonder Woman, and no one bothers to verify whether the particulars are true and accurate,&nbsp;to security guards&nbsp;demanding that&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;produce a photo ID in exchange for a&nbsp;temporary visitor pass.&nbsp; Such manual security checks create a lot of hassle, impede the movement of people and cause inconvenience to visitors.&nbsp; For all the hassle, the security checks are not effective at all because, even if the visitor is required to produce his NRIC and this is in exchange for a visitor pass, his particulars are seldom physically recorded down.&nbsp;This is because manual recording is time consuming and requires a lot of work.&nbsp; When the visitor leaves the building, he takes his NRIC with him and leaves.&nbsp; So it does not serve any purpose because, at the end of the day, I am sure the security guards do not know or do not have any record of who has entered and left the building in the course of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a terrorist incident were to occur, there is little information about who has been in the building.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the information on our NRIC, in its present form, is passive.&nbsp; Our existing NRIC is a rather&nbsp;dumb device in the sense that personal information of the holder is merely printed on a piece of plastic.&nbsp; Information has to be copied manually from the NRIC to another medium.&nbsp; So the transfer and recording of information are not efficient or fast enough.&nbsp; I would like to propose that we replace our NRIC with one that has a smart chip embedded in it that can store a lot more information about the owner and certain particulars can be transferred instantaneously and contactlessly by tapping on the detector, like our ez-link cards.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Terrorism</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani:</B>&nbsp; Sir, earlier this year, we had a very high profile emergency preparedness exercise involving five MRT stations, transport services, more than 20 agencies, thousands of individuals, including members of the public.&nbsp; It was Exercise NorthStar V (North 5). There was&nbsp;NorthStar I, II,&nbsp;III and&nbsp;IV which members of the public might have forgotten or not aware of.&nbsp;Indeed, there will be many similar exercises in the future, maybe on a smaller scale and&nbsp;in different settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the light of these exercises and lessons learned from incidents in London, Madrid, Bali and elsewhere, what is the state of readiness of our agencies in the event of such emergency, including terror attacks?&nbsp; In the event of a terrorist attack, besides injury to individuals and damage to property, we can also expect disruptions to businesses and jobs.&nbsp; Are our businesses prepared to react in the event of an attack?&nbsp; I understand that the Ministry has formulated a corporate First Response Scheme for this.&nbsp; How well has this scheme been taken up by our businesses and companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the public support the need for exercises such as NorthStar V.&nbsp; Some have suggested more exercises and even at peak hours.&nbsp;Is it because they feel that the public are not mentally prepared and are still not very sure of what to do in the event of an attack?&nbsp; Looking ahead, what exercises - a same question was&nbsp;asked earlier -&nbsp;does the Ministry intend to hold, to improve or expand on NorthStar V?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another adverse effect of a terrorist attack, perhaps one that is capable of the most harm, is to our inter-community relations.&nbsp;

Yet, nothing was done in these areas.&nbsp; ICA continues to be caught by surprise by these peak arrivals during festive seasons, and I think they are not doing their job well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the need for tighter security to prevent illegal entries at the checkpoints, the ICA also needs to do a good and fast job clearing the travellers fast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, there are now eight private marinas in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the eight is currently undergoing rebuilding to be the first public marina in Singapore and will be ready next year.&nbsp; Most of the marinas provide facilities not just to their members, they also house restaurants that cater to the public.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, at Sentosa Cove, One Degree 15 played host to the round-the-world clipper fleet, a competing group of sailing vessels which included our very own Singaporean team.&nbsp; Not only do marinas provide recreational sea sports and club facilities, let us not forget they also serve as key entry points onto our shores.&nbsp; Sir, with the step-up to increase security measures at all the various entry points into Singapore, this is a call for the tightening up of checkpoints security for all pleasure crafts entering into and leaving Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there does not seem to be an adequate system of security checks for vessels berthing at marinas.&nbsp; This leaves us open and exposed to possible security threats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this observation is based on consultation with persons in the marina industry.&nbsp; In addition, I have also personally experienced the lack of&nbsp;security measures on board a pleasure craft at one of the marinas and I will elaborate later on.&nbsp; A pleasure craft or sailing vessel entering into Singapore waters has two different ways of obtaining immigration clearance.&nbsp; Pleasure crafts berthing at the Republic of Singapore Yacht Club and Raffles Marina have access to on-site checkpoints, while vessels that berth at other marinas are cleared at offshore checkpoints.&nbsp; In both situations, it seems that the vessels are not subjected to any security checks whatsoever.&nbsp; Both checkpoints seem to operate for the sole purpose of immigration clearance only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few instances when I was on board a vessel at one of the marinas which provided for on-site checkpoint clearance.&nbsp; On one occasion, the immigration officer came down to the vessel to check our passports and, on another, we left the vessel to go down to the marina office to meet the officers.&nbsp; Sir, I am also told that there are instances where the skipper just takes all the passports&nbsp;down to be stamped and his crew does not necessarily follow him.&nbsp; In this case, the immigration officer would not be able to find out if the passports matched the passengers on board.&nbsp; On both occasions, our passports were cleared, but the vessel was not subjected to any security checks.&nbsp; I would like to ask whose job is it then to run thorough security checks on all the vessels that enter and leave our marinas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the following are two suggestions to address this security concern.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, develop a more detailed system of security checks and procedures to thoroughly inspect every vessel entering and leaving Singapore's marinas.&nbsp; We have in place proper checks at the airport, ferry terminals and at the Causeway.&nbsp; Why not the marinas as well?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to install more on-site checkpoints at marinas so as to adequately provide for effective security and immigration clearance to minimise unnecessary commute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the interest of safeguarding Singapore's national security, this is an area that should be dealt with more seriously, lest it be a loophole for abuse.&nbsp; This is especially so with the opening of Marina at Keppel Bay, which is situated near the heart of the city and juxtaposed with the integrated resorts, and this is an area where compromise is not an option.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Is this the trend for such cases over the last 10 years?&nbsp; May I also ask the Minister to what extent are the victims themselves to blame for these offences?&nbsp; There has been a marked increase of thefts involving handphones in recent years and, in many cases, it seems that handphone owners tended to leave their handphones around or to use them to book seats at hawker centres.&nbsp; Can more be done to educate the public to be more security-conscious for their companies, shops, homes and personal belongings?&nbsp; On the other hand, is there a need for legislative changes to deter these crimes and arrest the rising trend?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also understand, Sir, that not an insignificant number of housebreaking offences were committed by serial housebreakers.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister what special efforts, if any, are being made in the rehabilitation of these serial housebreakers.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the crime statistics compiled by the police show a 20% increase in overall seizable crimes in 2005, amounting to an increase of 6,081 cases more than in 2004.&nbsp; There have been very significant increases in snatch theft at 47%, rioting at 35.1% and robbery at 31.7%.&nbsp; In the case of rioting, the police has noted that there has been an increase in rioting taking place in public housing estates, either in the common areas of HDB blocks or along the streets of housing blocks.&nbsp; Also taking place in the common areas of HDB blocks are outraging of modesty cases which rose by 19.3% in 2005.&nbsp; It raises the question about the safety of our neighbourhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware of the two recent cases of firearms being used in the course of committing robbery, which Ms Indranee Rajah raised.&nbsp; I have the same concerns.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the obvious questions to ask are:&nbsp; is the crime situation expected to worsen further?&nbsp; Does the police have sufficient resources to be effective to meet these challenges?&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, it is not comforting to read the financial estimates presented to Parliament for the current year 2006.&nbsp; The Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to spend 6.4% more in fiscal year 2006, compared with 2005.&nbsp; But this extra expenditure is not expected to increase the effectiveness or efficiency of the police.&nbsp; According to the key performance indicators in the financial estimates, the police appears to have lowered its expectation in 2006 in that the percentage of urgent incidents responded to by the police&nbsp;within 15 minutes is expected to drop from 90% to 87%; the percentage of non-urgent incidents responded to by the police within 30 minutes is expected to drop from 92.5% to 90%; the percentage of 999 calls answered within 10 seconds is expected to drop from 97.4% to 90%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that FY2006 will be even more challenging for the police, as we are hosting the IMF&nbsp;meetings in September and are anticipating not only protecting the many VIPs but also handling protests expected from visiting non-governmental organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Minister satisfied with the current crime situation and level of police resources?&nbsp; Have we compromised community safety by deploying manpower to counter terrorism and hosting international meetings?&nbsp; Has the headcount policy taken an unhealthy impact on the police force, resulting in lower efficiency and readiness in combating crime by the Home Team?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One is the status of proposed legislation on sex with minors overseas, and the other is on the&nbsp;measures that would be taken to deal with commercial sex with minors in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first topic, it would be recalled that sometime ago in this House, the Senior Minister of State said that the Ministry would look into this issue of Singaporean adults who go abroad and engage in sex with minors overseas.&nbsp; The Ministry was at that time looking into it, and although the initial answers had been that this was something that we would not be doing, the last status indication was that this is something that was under review.&nbsp; I would therefore like to know what is the current status on this and whether legislation will be introduced to deal with this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a difficult problem because of the evidentiary difficulties.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have strict laws to deal with the problem.&nbsp; If somebody engages in sex with a minor in Singapore, we can handle the evidence and the police can prosecute it.&nbsp; It is within our control.&nbsp; It is much more difficult, of course, when an adult goes abroad, because the act occurs overseas, the witnesses are overseas, the child is overseas.&nbsp; The difficulties of prosecuting are clear.&nbsp; But that by itself does not mean and should not be a reason for not having legislation to deal with this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, having legislation would send a strong signal to people that we regard it as wrong.&nbsp; There is something particularly abhorrent about this kind of offence because it takes a particularly horrible kind of advantage over young children.&nbsp; What is worse is that the offenders who do this are the sort of people who present a respectable front in the society where they are known but yet they go abroad, engage in this kind of acts,&nbsp;come back and then put back&nbsp;their front.&nbsp; So, one, it sends a signal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because there is the possibility of prosecution in Singapore, it would make them think twice about it and, therefore, act as a deterrent.&nbsp; So, I just wanted to ask the Minister where we are on the status of this proposed legislation and whether or not the Ministry will be introducing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Last year, there was a 20% increase in recorded cases. So crime trends, in general, are on the uptrend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first half of 2005, youths arrested for crimes were up by 9%, compared to the same period in 2004.&nbsp; By the end of the year, the youth crime figures were 4,594, which was 122 youths less than 2004.&nbsp; However, I note with concern that although the numbers have fallen,&nbsp;youth crime&nbsp;in the three most common offences&nbsp;is up: rioting, 483 cases in 2005, which is more than double the 2004 figures; shop theft, 1,423 cases, which is up by almost 50% from 2004; and other thefts, 787 cases, which&nbsp;are up by 50% from 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth arrest has accounted for 22% of all arrests, even though they make up about 15% of our population according to the Police.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we take some data in perspective, we may be able to see how important it is to nip the problem&nbsp;in the bud.&nbsp; Even if 10% of students, who do not make it through to complete secondary school, turn to crime, and each of this 10% pools together a small gang, we are looking at staggering numbers of potential gang members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the data is worrying. We have to stem the tide of our youths turning to crime. Perhaps, they do not appreciate the seriousness of their actions at an early age and what implications they can have later in life.&nbsp; I applaud the Home Team in keeping the overall numbers in check.&nbsp; The Inter-ministry Committee on Youth Crime has come up with several programmes to check youth crime.&nbsp; Its effectiveness is measurable.&nbsp; In 2004, MCYS conducted a study on the cohort of youth offenders discharged from the IMC on Youth Crime Guidance Programme (GP) in 2000. The number who returned to crime&nbsp;went down&nbsp;from 30% to 7.5%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other programmes, such as the Streetwise Programme, involve prison visits for those youths at risk, in tandem with CID.&nbsp; Arrangements are made with the Prisons Department for identified wayward youths to visit the Changi Prison and Changi Women Prison respectively. Sir, I propose that such visits be extended to all students.&nbsp; The visit offers youths an opportunity to see for themselves the tough regime that prisoners have to undergo and the spartan conditions in prison.&nbsp; Personal glimpses into the harsh life behind bars also serve as a strong message to the youths, warning them of the freedom that they would lose if they persist in getting into trouble with the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister would consider extending such programmes to more youths to nip the problem&nbsp;in its bud as the youths would be reminded, in no uncertain terms, that having a prison record would close some opportunities for them, notwithstanding the Yellow Ribbon Project which is the subject of my next cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Rehabilitation of Prisoners</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> According to SCORE, about 11,000 ex-offenders are released from the various prisons and drug rehabilitation centres every year.&nbsp; SCORE is the key agency that seeks to rehabilitate and help re-integrate offenders to become responsible and contributing members of the society.&nbsp; Its Yellow Ribbon Project established in 2004 was well received by the public.&nbsp; I understand that some 90,000 students and teachers were involved in the \"Wear a Yellow Ribbon\" Project.&nbsp; Employers also played their part in the Yellow Ribbon job fair where 150 soon-to-be-released inmates were successful in their job interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the report on \"Youth: Creating Our Future\" consultation exercise by MCYS, ex-offenders had called for society to be more understanding and for more rehabilitation and employment opportunities so that they can re-integrate and participate in contributing to the society.&nbsp; If we cannot serve their needs, then, coupled with the stigma that society places on them, the offender might be dragged into a vicious cycle of criminalisation.&nbsp; Minor offenders, through incarceration, may find themselves too estranged from society to re-integrate.&nbsp; I ask the Minister to share his plans to prevent this cycle of criminalisation of the 11,000 ex-offenders released each year.&nbsp; Would the Minister share with us how many have been successfully re-integrated and what is the relapse rate?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Neighbourhood Police Centres</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, one of the prominent structures within our housing estates in the 1980s was the Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs). Feedback from residents then was that they saw and felt the presence of Police within the community. Directional signs showing where NPPs were gave a sense of comfort and confidence that the Police was just a shout away. Residents were familiar with the men in blue patrolling the estates on bicycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since 1996, many of these NPPs have given way to larger and more consolidated Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs had, in 2004, informed the House that the NPCs are more cost-effective as they enable more Police officers to be deployed on neighbourhood patrols.&nbsp; It was argued then that a more mobile Police would&nbsp;more effectively project Police presence on the ground.&nbsp; Feedback that I have received in the last couple of years, however, seems to indicate that the public is feeling less of Police presence now than the days when the NPPs were operational.&nbsp; We may argue that the actual effectiveness of the Police, for example, more patrols and all, is more important than people's perception of Police presence. We can also argue, however, that people's perception of Police presence may also have a deterrent effect on&nbsp;potential criminal behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if MHA has studied the public's perception of Police presence in the community and how&nbsp;this perception can be improved to give them a better sense of safety and security.&nbsp; We have introduced the CSSP to encourage greater community involvement but I think we still need to address this sense of security with or without the presence of the Police in the neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the crime rate last year, as mentioned by many Members, rose by 19% compared to 2004.&nbsp; The index crimes like house-breaking, robbery, snatch theft all registered significant increases.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if MHA tracks the crime rates by location, ie, the extent to which crimes are committed within HDB housing estates, especially the index crimes that have increased.&nbsp; I ask this to ascertain if NPCs' presence or lack thereof has an effect on crimes committed in housing estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a related question raised by the public is that Police patrolling has been reduced since the NPCs took over and that the Police has less manpower.&nbsp; They have fed back that the NPCs have taken a longer time to investigate cases and to address their concerns.&nbsp; Here, I would like to ask the following questions: what is the difference in terms of the number of personnel assigned to the housing estates now as compared to when the NPPs were more prominently located in the housing estates?&nbsp; What is the ratio or&nbsp;population norm of the number of Police personnel to the residents in the estates that the NPCs are responsible for, ie, how many policemen to how many people in a particular geographical location?&nbsp; Does the Minister feel that the number of personnel in the NPCs is adequate or are there plans to increase the manpower in the NPCs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the NPCs have been around for 10 years now since its inception in 1996.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what are the key performance indicators of these NPCs apart from the crime rates, for example,&nbsp;the Police's relationship with the public, community involvement in crime prevention, time taken to investigate cases, etc.&nbsp; How have these NPCs performed vis-a-vis these indicators?&nbsp; How have they performed compared to the NPPs?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Police Force</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ravindran:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Singapore Police Force has an excellent reputation among the public.&nbsp; They have been at the forefront of crime prevention, crime detection and in the maintenance of internal security.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the first generation of Police officers who joined the Force around the period of independence will soon be retiring or many have retired, and a whole new generation of young officers are now joining the Police Force.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is whether, with a higher educational requirement for entering into the Police Force, many of the young Police officers who are entering the Police Force will have the many skills and talents which were prevalent amongst the older Police officers, particularly in the area of detection and intelligence at an early stage of a crime before it is committed or even after a crime has been committed.&nbsp; So far, the track record has been good.&nbsp; I am hoping to see whether such a track record can be continued and how do we enable our officers to have this ability to have the network on the ground to detect crime at an early stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second point that I would like to raise is, with many officers being deployed&nbsp;to undertake many more tasks, and maximum work being&nbsp;performed by&nbsp;our officers, whether they have enough time to go for further training to develop their professionalism. And with the move of the Police Academy to its new campus at Chua Chu Kang,&nbsp;can we now enable more resources to be put in to enhance the professionalism of the Police officers who are joining&nbsp;as new officers and also those who are already in the Police Force?&nbsp; How can we enhance their professionalism?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Police Academy</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:&nbsp;</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, policing today is no longer about crime prevention, crime investigation and preservation of law and order.&nbsp; Police's role is multi-faceted and the Police have to be trained in people-to-people relations, dealing with minors and be conscious of the rapidly changing social environment within the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training in soft skills aside, it is also good that we continue to work on the image of the Police Force as one that reaches out to the public and not necessarily as <I>tangkap</I>&nbsp;Police, giving them a very hard and tough image that will not help to build trust and confidence with the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, care must be taken in handling minors so that their emotional and mental welfare will not be&nbsp;jeopardised.&nbsp; For example, for runaway kids, can the Police training help to strengthen the minors' family ties?&nbsp; Will the Police partner the MCYS, for example, and the parents to study into the coincidence of runaway kids and families with step-parents, as reported in today's <I>Straits Times</I>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police Academy that has been set up and is now providing centralised training may consider conducting special courses on how to deal with juveniles, since statistics indicated that crimes committed by young people have been on the uptrend, so that they can have a better understanding of the social and emotional development of young people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course may cover areas, such as behavioural science, with emphasis on understanding juvenile behaviour. Counselling of juveniles is another&nbsp;course that should be included as part of the basic training for Police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in terms of the career prospects for Police officers, the Academy may want to consider tie-ups with the universities to allow these officers, who want to pursue their interest in behavioural science, to go on to take degree courses.&nbsp; In this way, our Police officers can actually progress&nbsp;on their studies and pursue degree courses related to criminology and other related disciplines dealing with people-management skills.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Mr Arthur Fong:</B>&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has one of the best transport infrastructures in the world.&nbsp; In a densely populated city like Singapore, we have maintained competitively high standards of road safety, with an average of 200-250 fatalities annually since the 1980s.&nbsp; However, some key concerns remain, as highlighted by the National Road Safety Action Plan - lack of lane discipline by&nbsp;many motorcyclists, particularly young riders;&nbsp;tendency of elderly pedestrians to avoid the use of pedestrian crossing facilities provided; cyclists and motorcyclists who ride in a manner that risks their own safety when interacting with other road users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Land Transport Authority undertakes regular road safety audits on the highways and arterial roads.&nbsp; However, one area highlighted by the recent tragic loss&nbsp;involving&nbsp;a Home Team member when his Rhino was involved in an accident needs urgent attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I submit that we need to step up education for our road users, particularly in respect to how road users&nbsp;should respond to emergency vehicles that are travelling on our roads when they are responding to emergency or an incident.&nbsp; I ask that the Minister share how our drivers can be educated through a comprehensive campaign to ensure safety of road users and also respond appropriately when emergency vehicles are on our roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we often see the ugly side of drivers on brinkmanship and opportunist take-over&nbsp;when a better sense of safety and consideration for other road users should be present.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, like many disasters, fire prevention is hugely better than cure.&nbsp; The SCDF has, in recent years, stepped up public education to prevent fire very considerably.&nbsp; More and more Civil Defence Executive Committees (CDEC) are being formed and I would like to encourage more citizens to participate in CDECs or form new CDECs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what more are being done to better educate the public to prevent fires and to better prepare them to react appropriately when there is one?&nbsp; I wish also to ask what is the SCDF's target in making Singapore emergency-trained.&nbsp; Is it one person for every 100 persons or one household per block or one household per floor, maybe?&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on this and how&nbsp;the Ministry intends that the SCDF achieve this target.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

After many years of the two-pronged approach of supply reduction and demand reduction, we can see the results.&nbsp; However, recently,&nbsp;press news of the emergence of subutex as an alternative to heroin is rather worrying.&nbsp; There have been reports of negative effects of subutex like gangrene,&nbsp;leading to limb amputation, which is far more serious physically than the effects of heroin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the issues raised is the perception that subutex is what is called a legal drug, ie, it is classified as a drug listed under the Poisons Act rather than as a controlled drug listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act.&nbsp; What was also reported was the emergence of a black market for subutex.&nbsp; If this is so, it seems that the heroin abusers are not using subutex as a treatment that it is supposed to be but, rather, it is used as an option and alternative drug to be abused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is the current state with respect to subutex abuse.&nbsp; Is&nbsp;MHA or MOH&nbsp;tracking the number of subutex abusers?&nbsp; Does CNB see the abuse of subutex as a worrying phenomenon?&nbsp; What is CNB's position and strategy with regard to handling the subutex abusers?&nbsp; Is it going to use similar strategy as it did with heroin abusers over the last couple of years?&nbsp; How does CNB intend to address this problem of the black market, if it is true that it exists?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, as subutex is becoming a drug of abuse and has negative effects, I wonder if MHA is considering classifying subutex as a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.&nbsp; Currently, also with regard to treatment, subutex abusers are treated at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), but I&nbsp;think the capacity at the IMH is quite limited.&nbsp; I do not have the number of cases of subutex abuse.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to share with us if there are&nbsp;figures on the number of subutex abusers.&nbsp; And if the number escalates,&nbsp;has CNB&nbsp;any plans to treat subutex abusers as they did for heroin abusers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Immigration</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to now take the cut on the topic of immigration.&nbsp; Sir, we are an open society.&nbsp; We welcome foreigners, whether they are working here or they want to continue to live here.&nbsp; With this open society,&nbsp;I think, anecdotally, we see an increase in the number of Singaporeans marrying foreigners.&nbsp; But, time and again, we see cases coming to our&nbsp;MPS appealing for foreign spouses to be allowed to stay here for longer periods, be it appeal for long term visit passes or&nbsp;for permanent resident status.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if ICA is seeing an increasing trend in the number of Singaporeans marrying foreign spouses and whether there is also an increasing trend of requests for foreign spouses to be given long term visit passes to enable them to settle&nbsp;down or&nbsp;perhaps to secure&nbsp;employment.&nbsp; At the same time,&nbsp;is there&nbsp;an increasing trend of requests for permanent residency amongst foreign spouses?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to that also, Sir, I think many Singaporeans who&nbsp;are keen under the option of marrying foreigners - because sometimes they do find it difficult to marry Singaporeans and we want to encourage them to marry and have children subsequently -&nbsp;would like to have a better idea as to what&nbsp;the implications are.&nbsp; Because sometimes they come to see us, after they married a foreigner,&nbsp;to say it is so difficult to have the foreigner stay here, and some of them&nbsp;do have children.&nbsp; The foreign spouses do bear children for them and for whatever reasons that are unknown to them, their spouses are asked to go back.&nbsp; Sometimes they go back with their children, and&nbsp;sometimes the children are left behind, and it creates a lot of uncertainty for these families.&nbsp; If we want to encourage Singaporeans to have an open mind to consider foreigners as potential brides or bridegrooms, we have to give them some education with regard to what is expected and&nbsp;is required, and explain to them what is the policy with regard to foreigners marrying in Singapore, and give them a clearer idea of what they need to do in order to facilitate the process of settling down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that there are a lot of issues.&nbsp; We want to make sure that these marriages are genuine marriages, that they are not bogus marriages and, therefore, we do not want to grant permanent residence almost immediately.&nbsp; But I think it would be good if&nbsp;we can help Singaporeans understand and, therefore, they can plan.&nbsp; If they find a potential partner, looking at what are some of the criteria, they may be in a better position to decide when they should marry, and how&nbsp;to go about trying to settle down.&nbsp; That, I think, will make it a lot easier for these individuals and, hopefully, our marriage rate can go up and&nbsp;our procreation rate will&nbsp;go up too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Revisions to Ministers' salaries and key changes arising from private sector salary trends (such as salary cuts and restorations) have also been made public. The formula for the Ministerial salary benchmark has remained unchanged since the last revision in 2000. The benchmark is pegged to two-thirds of the income of the&nbsp; 24th highest earner (median) among a group comprising the top eight earners from the six professions (bankers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, MNCs, local manufacturers). Ministers took the lead by taking wage cuts in November 2001 and July 2003, following the economic downturn during those periods.&nbsp; These cuts have been restored in two steps in July 2004 and January 2005, along with those for the civil service, to the pre-November 2001 levels (prior to wage cuts). Notwithstanding the restoration of the cuts, Ministerial salaries have lagged behind the salary benchmarks compared to the year 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
