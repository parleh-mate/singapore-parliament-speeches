Economics and defence have through history remained\r\nthe carrot and stick, at the disposal of governments to ensure that\r\nany nation is taken seriously on the international stage. For Singapore,\r\nour journey to independence was one fraught with the whims of the\r\npolitical powers of the times. From our time as a little inhabited\r\nisland to the early days of our independence, our defence laid not\r\nin our hands but that of others.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-40139363-cc11-445d-8bdc-cbae83ada4b7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-40139363-cc11-445d-8bdc-cbae83ada4b7\"><!--a--></a>I paid a visit to the\r\nKranji War Memorial on the eve of the 70th Anniversary of the Fall of\r\nSingapore.

However, we could not afford a large\r\narmy of professional soldiers. Conscription was seen as the best\r\nway to build up a credible defence force without placing a heavy\r\nburden on Singapore's manpower and financial resources. Are these\r\nconsiderations for NS 45 years ago and now still the same? Can MINDEF\r\nexplain the consideration behind maintaining NS?

Citizens should play an active role through National Service.\r\nI wish to raise two points in this regard which deserve our due consideration.\r\nThe first relates to various proposals for National Service to be\r\nshortened from the current two years to one year or so. In its place,\r\nthe professional armed forces can be further built up by boosting\r\nthe incentives for young men and women to join as regulars. Taiwan\r\nhas announced that it will cut the length of its military conscription from\r\none year to just four months next year. South Korea has set it to\r\nbe 21 months. Singapore is the country with the second longest fixed\r\nconscription length in the world, just behind Israel. I am sure\r\nthis House will agree that South Korea and Taiwan are not in any\r\nless need of strong armed forces than Singapore. If anything, their\r\narmed forces have been called up for actual combat action in the\r\npast two decades. My main reason for advocating the shortening of\r\nNS is this: since the Government has welcomed such a number of foreigners\r\ninto our workforce in the past decade, Singapore may urgently need\r\nto close the gap as to when they start their working lives.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c18298af-c4ed-4cff-a46d-0545ac230465\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c18298af-c4ed-4cff-a46d-0545ac230465\"><!--a--></a>This relates to my second\r\npoint which is that some employers prefer to hire foreigners over\r\nSingaporeans because Singaporean males are liable for reservist training.\r\nUnderstandably, the employer is left in the lurch when the employee\r\ncannot show up for work particularly when the job in question is\r\nlabour-intensive. If the resentment\r\namong Singaporeans affected is left unchecked, the result would\r\nbe the complete opposite of what the Government had set out to achieve\r\nwith NS, namely, to inculcate a commitment to Singapore's defence\r\nand security.

Back in the 1950s when local athletes started representing\r\nus in international and regional games, the numbers were few. Many\r\nof them were juggling a full-time job and their sport. Due to the\r\nlack of support from the Government, talents like Olympic weightlifter,\r\nMr Tan Howe Liang, had to finance his training.

But MINDEF is also mindful that this trust has\r\nbeen earned over the years through careful spending and the equitable\r\nimplementation of all our policies. I want to reassure Members of\r\nthis House that MINDEF will endeavour to maintain and deepen this\r\ntrust, and it is in that spirit, I welcome the opportunity to respond\r\nto queries from hon Members, to forge a strong and collective will.\r\nI will have to although add a caveat. The questions are all encompassing\r\nand look way into the future. I think it will take many days to\r\nrespond to all their questions.

SARS provided a bitter foretaste of what would happen\r\nif the flows of people and goods were disrupted, and that was only\r\nfor a few weeks.

We look at our archives often,\r\nbecause it is a treasure trove of information, and Dr Goh had two\r\npieces of sagely advice. First, in 1973, when Singapore was still\r\nrelatively poor and undeveloped, Dr Goh said, \"The curious thing about\r\nSingaporeans in general is that they are very optimistic that war\r\nwill never occur in Singapore. This attitude of the general public\r\nis all right for the economic progress of Singapore but it should\r\nnever be that of the policy makers in the public sector. We have to\r\nthink of such eventualities and make preparation well in advance.\"\r\nLet me give Members a second quote. This was one in 1984, when our\r\nnation was on a much firmer footing. Dr Goh added, \"The most dependable\r\nguarantee of our Independence is a strong SAF. A strong SAF in turn\r\ndepends on the political will to make the effort and pay the price.\"\r\nHis advice, therefore: prepare for unthinkable eventualities well\r\nin advance and maintain the political will for a strong defence.\r\nThis is why we invest considerable amounts each year on defence.\r\nBut more than that, as Mrs Lina Chiam, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Pritam Singh\r\ntalked about, we require each Singaporean male to commit himself to\r\nmany years of National Service. Can we keep up that political will?\r\nWe have many opportunity costs, divergent needs, individual aspirations.\r\nCan we keep up that political will, which Dr Goh quite presciently\r\npointed out that we needed to do? We must.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2002</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-88e3063d-f695-438f-abdb-9f9525e908ed\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-88e3063d-f695-438f-abdb-9f9525e908ed\"><!--a--></a>Because, to paraphrase\r\na famous statesman, we dare not tempt others with our weakness.\r\nWho said that?

How will we know when we have achieved it? Sir, these immutable\r\nconstraints force us to leverage on technology, innovation and unflinching\r\nhuman will to overcome our limitations. Translated to stark military\r\nterms, we have to know more, see first, and respond sharply and\r\ndecisively to disable, if not destroy, would-be aggressors. That\r\nkind of capability is hard to come by, even if we are willing to\r\npay for it. But we have made considerable progress over the years.\r\nAnd the questions that you asked today indicate that we have made\r\nconsiderable progress. The questions were: Can we now afford to\r\nrelax a little? How are we changing our SAF? Can we now reduce NS\r\ncommitments? The very fact that you are asking it is a reflection\r\nthat we have succeeded.

Dr\r\nLim said, how did we get value for money? Let me provide details.\r\nWe have said previously that the Government is prepared to spend\r\nup to 6% of GDP on defence, but MINDEF only asks for what we need\r\neach year. Our overall approach is to maintain a stable defence\r\nbudget that grows gradually in absolute terms and to manage that prudently.\r\nOver the last five years, defence expenditure has grown steadily\r\nby about 4% annually, on average. It was $10.7 billion in 2008 and,\r\nas Members pointed out, $12.3 billion this year. Such steady spending\r\nis a critical enabler, because it allows MINDEF to take a long-term\r\nview and obtain the best value for our defence investments. It allows the\r\nSAF to steadily build up its capabilities, exploit nascent technologies\r\n\u2013 so in other words, we can actually spot a technology that will\r\ncome on the market even before it has and exploit it \u2013 minimise disruptions\r\nand effectively network its various services so that the combined\r\ncapability is more powerful than its individual parts.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2003</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-999da7aa-a9c9-4c80-9118-a825a6c771e1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-999da7aa-a9c9-4c80-9118-a825a6c771e1\"><!--a--></a>I want to assure Members\r\nthat MINDEF is mindful of our responsibility to spend carefully\r\nand wisely. We are acutely aware that we have a major share of our Government\r\nbudget. We buy only what we need, scrutinise available options for\r\nthe most cost-effective solution. Our first instinct is to upgrade\r\nexisting platforms to extend their lifespan, instead of purchasing\r\nnew ones. For example, the Navy's corvettes \u2013 some of you may have\r\nserved on it \u2013 are 21 years old, but instead of being replaced immediately,\r\nthey will be upgraded to add many more years of operations. Our\r\ntwo Archer-class submarines were bought second-hand and upgraded\r\nto be stealthier, with longer endurance, and extended reach.

Military forces all over know that\r\none of the hardest missions to conduct is what we call the \"integrated\r\nstrike\". That means close coordination, cross-coordination, between\r\ndifferent elements to neutralise a moving target.

The Commanding General of US' Fort Sill\r\narmy base, this was a Major-General, David Halverson, said after\r\nwitnessing one of these integrated live-firing exercises, \"It is\r\napparent that the SAF has tremendous attack and defence capabilities.\r\nI witnessed a world-class effort earlier with the complex coordination\r\nwith the various land and air assets.\" It is a major achievement.\r\nIf you talk to the pioneers of the SAF, they know what we were up\r\nagainst, how difficult it was even to have a joint command.

It is a fair question.\r\nI think Mr Pritam Singh and Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked that. It is a\r\nfair question but difficult for anyone to know what the right answer\r\nis. 9/11 caught many countries off guard. Many European countries\r\nplanned to enjoy the peace dividend after the Cold War. When I meet\r\nDefence Ministers\r\ntoday in Europe, they tell me exactly that. They were planning to\r\ndownsize after the Cold War, but after 9/11 found themselves stretched\r\nand hurried to respond adequately. Canada was also reducing and\r\nreplacing some of its tanks. It is further away, separated by the\r\nAtlantic. And then 9/11 occurred. It then had to hurriedly acquire\r\nnew tanks for their troops in Afghanistan. Once a particular capability\r\nis lost, it will take many years to recover even if spending is\r\nramped up later. Worse still, it can cause the loss of lives later.\r\nThe UK is an example. In the late 1970s, the Royal Navy failed to\r\nreplace its airborne early warning capability in its ageing fleet.\r\nSo in the unanticipated Falklands War in 1982, this led directly\r\nto the loss of a number of ships and deaths of many servicemen and\r\ncivilians. Mr Ong Teng Koon talked about this when he mentioned \"unknown\r\nunknowns\". But even for known threats, any military force will tell\r\nyou that there are always ways to further strengthen defences if\r\nmore resources are allocated. I think, on balance, all of us will\r\nfeel safer if we continue to maintain a potent SAF through steady\r\nand prudent investments.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2004</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-31af9170-644f-4918-8c06-f0b3726fa1cd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-31af9170-644f-4918-8c06-f0b3726fa1cd\"><!--a--></a>Ultimately, however, it\r\nis our people \u2013 our NSFs, NSmen and regulars \u2013 who form the SAF\r\nfighting force. And I share Mr Pritam Singh's concern. He mentioned\r\nthat there were perceptions about how Singaporeans feel that they\r\nhave to contribute more to Singapore, including NS, and that others\r\nreap the benefits. I share that concern. We have to show Singaporeans\r\nthat we value their contributions. And that is what we are trying to\r\ndo, whether it is through education, pre-school education, special\r\neducation, health, housing, retirement, even NS itself, even the\r\nSAF itself, it is all for Singaporeans. Some of you may have not\r\nbeen struck by the slide that the Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister\r\nTharman showed in economic terms, how much taxes for the median\r\nor the average worker versus how much you get over a lifetime. It\r\nwas quite an interesting fact that you did not own a car, you actually\r\nget more than what you get. But translated to day-to-day experiences,\r\nI hope that Singaporeans recognise that all that we are doing to build\r\nthis Singapore up, the various systems and social support, is for\r\nSingaporeans. And we will have to do more, recognising the NS contributions\r\nto show that citizens count for more and that foreigners complement\r\nand help us build this place. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-77ed9277-10bf-425b-ab87-52f2c0f28b08\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-77ed9277-10bf-425b-ab87-52f2c0f28b08\"><!--a--></a>I am not sure that is\r\nenough, but I think we also have to bear in mind that Singaporeans,\r\non the other hand, have also received from others. We have many Singaporeans\r\nwho go overseas, to the UK, to Canada, to Australia, to the US.\r\nAnd when I was studying in the US \u2013 I was doing my fellowship in\r\ncancer surgery, at the MD Anderson Cancer Center \u2013 it was during\r\nthe time of the first Iraqi War. And there were lectures, scheduled\r\nsurgeries that I could attend then and I was there on a Government scholarship.\r\nAnd top surgeons from this top cancer centre were called up, volunteered. A\r\ntop thoracic surgeon suddenly was called up; lectures were cancelled\r\nbecause he went to serve. I was there, he is protecting his interests.\r\nI am continuing to study while he is giving up opportunity cost.\r\nSo the shoe can be on the other foot. And we have to explain to\r\nSingaporeans in the longer term, this is for our country and for\r\nyour children.

When there is a need, they are the first responders,\r\nto protect Singapore when our survival is threatened. So, in that\r\neventuality, we have to have sufficient numbers and we need to train\r\nthem, we need to have adequate time to train and prepare them for\r\ntheir role effectively. In 2004, because of our 3G (3rd Generation) transformation\r\nand technological improvements, we shortened it, from 2.5 years\r\nto two years. And in 2006, we shortened the Operationally Ready\r\nNS (ORNS) from 13 years to 10 years. And that reduction, whether\r\nit was in 2004 or 2006, in NS duration corresponded with the surge\r\nin NS intake from 2006 to 2015. In other words, we are seeing that\r\nsurge now. But from 2016, our cohort size will fall. There is a\r\ndemographic echo there. It occurs a few years when they come on\r\nstream to NS. So, from 2016, the cohort size, the absolute numbers,\r\nwill fall.

MINDEF earns the trust and support for NS from\r\nall Singaporeans, only when we adhere strictly to three fundamental\r\nprinciples. First, NS must be to meet a critical national need for\r\nsecurity and survival because it imposes considerable cost both\r\nto the individual and to the nation. Second, NS must be universal.\r\nAll young Singaporean males who are fit to serve are eligible for\r\nconscription. The third principle is equity which means that NS\r\npolicies are applied equitably to everyone regardless of background\r\nor status.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d3567b78-40b8-4e1d-9ca3-1a390c2b5e84\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d3567b78-40b8-4e1d-9ca3-1a390c2b5e84\"><!--a--></a>Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked\r\nif our disruption policy can be made more flexible in view of the\r\nchanging tertiary education landscape. MINDEF is very mindful about\r\nthe changing trends in the education as well as employment of NSmen.\r\nWe do exercise flexibility in considering disruption requests, but\r\nwe have to balance this against the impact that disruptions have\r\non the training and operational readiness of the individual and\r\nhis unit. At the same time, in looking at disruption matters, we\r\ncontinue to uphold the fundamental principles that I outlined earlier.\r\nFor this reason, disruption for studies is considered only on the\r\nbasis of equity, so that individuals in the same Singapore school cohort\r\nbut in different enlistment intakes can still proceed for their\r\ndegree studies at the same university at the same time. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2639c60f-d734-4bf6-8036-86782cd592a7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2639c60f-d734-4bf6-8036-86782cd592a7\"><!--a--></a>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and\r\nMr Pritam Singh asked about our deferment policy for athletes and\r\nsportsmen. In particular, Er Dr Lee spoke very passionately about\r\nthis, and I would like to assure her that we understand the concerns\r\nthat are raised. MINDEF also exercises flexibility to allow deferment\r\nfrom full-time NS for exceptional sportsmen, who have been strongly\r\nsupported by MCYS and selected to represent Singapore in major competitions\r\nlike the Olympics. For every such case, MINDEF considers the individual's\r\npast achievements, his potential and the need for long deferments.\r\nIn addition, MINDEF also exercises flexibility to grant deferments\r\nof shorter periods to national athletes representing Singapore in\r\nmajor competitions. For example, 13 athletes were deferred for a period of\r\ntwo to six months to participate in the 2011 SEA Games and 2010\r\nAsian Games. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2009</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-113a116f-aabe-43c2-ae7f-52144b7cba99\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-113a116f-aabe-43c2-ae7f-52144b7cba99\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the strength of our\r\nNS institution is drawn primarily from the commitment of our NSmen\r\npast and present.

Our current\r\ngeneration of NSFs is a technology-savvy group, more accustomed\r\nto a self-directed learning environment from their days in school.\r\nAnd we have observed that they learn better when they collaborate\r\nand exchange knowledge with their peers. In so doing, they become\r\nmore adaptive, take greater ownership of their training. And these\r\nabilities \u2013 to sense-make and adapt rapidly, to work together collaboratively\r\n\u2013 are essential for today's soldiers in the modern battlefield. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-86c99089-886e-4902-9cab-36ce70bc94af\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-86c99089-886e-4902-9cab-36ce70bc94af\"><!--a--></a>Hence, the SAF has started\r\nto transform its learning and training systems to take into account\r\nthese considerations, which also serve to help ease the transition\r\ninto NS for our enlistees, and make NS a more positive experience\r\nfor them.

I am heartened to hear from the Minister of State just\r\nnow that NSmen are using the LEARNet now to improve learning so\r\nthat it can cut down learning time by 10% to 15%.

I am here speaking on behalf of Singapore because there is\r\nreally an opportunity cost for our young Singapore males who are\r\nserving NS now, but they are competing with an international workforce, they\r\nare competing with males from other countries at the international\r\nrealm.

He mentioned\r\nthat the principle of NS has to be on equity. I would like to ask\r\nthe Minister of State, when we were asking for flexibility in terms\r\nof disruptions and deferment, it does not mean that the NSman or\r\nthe NSF does not want to serve. They want to serve but they are\r\nhoping that they can fulfil their personal aspiration of completing\r\npart of their tertiary education before they come back to serve.\r\nMany countries such as Turkey, Korea and even Taiwan have introduced\r\nflexibility in their system whereby they allow the males to serve\r\nas long as they serve before a certain age.

And you need an adequate\r\nduration to train them to play that role effectively. I think a\r\ngreater sin is to call up people for NS and not train them effectively\r\nfor that role. So, I think all of us will agree that the political\r\nwill means that you call them up and you train them effectively\r\nto play that role. That is a primary consideration. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3791e28d-3b09-4fb1-9146-480e6a4f77ed\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3791e28d-3b09-4fb1-9146-480e6a4f77ed\"><!--a--></a>We did reduce NS from\r\ntwo and a half to two years in 2004, and, in 2006, the ORNS from\r\n13 years to 10 years. But as I said, that was in line with our 3G\r\ntransformation and technological improvements. More importantly,\r\nit also corresponded with a surge of NS intakes that occurred from\r\n2006 to 2015. But from 2016, each cohort size will fall. So, I think\r\nwe want to be very careful about this transition, study it carefully\r\nto see what it entails in terms of capabilities and operational\r\naspects. So, until further review, we should keep at least the two-year\r\nand 10-year cycles.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-9f28e8c0-4e4a-4759-b193-aa454629102c\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-9f28e8c0-4e4a-4759-b193-aa454629102c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-838d1c19-14fb-4761-9c61-f64a5760a63e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-838d1c19-14fb-4761-9c61-f64a5760a63e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nI thank the Member for that clarification. As I mentioned earlier,\r\nour considerations for disruption are based on the fundamental principle\r\nof equity. In doing so, we want to maintain the integrity of our\r\nNational Service system. This is of importance because, as the Minister\r\nexplained, National Servicemen form the backbone of the SAF. When\r\nwe look at considerations for deferment, we already do that for\r\nup to the first education bar, which means for NS-liable males to\r\ndo their A-levels,\r\npolytechnics, or equivalent educational qualifications. And then\r\nbeyond that, I think if we allow a system where anyone can choose\r\nto do NS at his own time, it would be very difficult to have an\r\nNS system that works. So, we allow for deferment for up to the first\r\neducation bar. Thereafter, the NS-liable males come in, they do\r\ntheir NS together and beyond that, we have a system that ensures\r\nthat students of the same cohort can be disrupted to go to university\r\nat the same time. This is a system that we have maintained and we\r\nshould continue to preserve this system so that the integrity of our\r\nNational Service system is maintained. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-affbb9f0-f9ab-42d7-9e3c-f92429e3da2d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-affbb9f0-f9ab-42d7-9e3c-f92429e3da2d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2016</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-eb537655-90c2-4665-91cb-ed5b65e527ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-eb537655-90c2-4665-91cb-ed5b65e527ec\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>: In\r\nthe interest of equity, I would appreciate it if the Members could keep\r\ntheir clarifications short.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-7f515754-b0b3-4033-981a-3489814bc89b\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-7f515754-b0b3-4033-981a-3489814bc89b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9002d326-a779-46fc-bb85-0b4e5909b288\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9002d326-a779-46fc-bb85-0b4e5909b288\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nI have two clarifications for Minister of State Lawrence Wong. First\r\nquestion is, how long NS deferment is MINDEF prepared to consider\r\nfor Joseph Schooling? For male swimmers, I understand that they\r\nwill peak at around 23, 24 years old, that is, by the 2020 Olympics.\r\nSecond clarification: is MINDEF ready to recognise sports achievement\r\nin lieu of National Service, that means, exempt them if they obtain\r\nOlympic medals?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3c6ba202-bcad-4ce4-ba6c-df6a289943ae\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-3c6ba202-bcad-4ce4-ba6c-df6a289943ae\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-418c6b3a-bf33-4313-b1e3-427f76e9096a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-418c6b3a-bf33-4313-b1e3-427f76e9096a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank\r\nthe Member for the clarifications. I would rather not get into the\r\ndetails of individual cases, but I will just say for Joseph Schooling,\r\nas I understand, he is already deferred from his National Service\r\nup to 2014. This is on the premise of the deferment for the first\r\neducation bar which I talked about. So, he will have time to train\r\nfor the Olympics this year and I am sure we will cheer for him and\r\nwish him well. Beyond that, I think it is premature to talk about\r\nwhether or not we can defer any further. If he wishes to apply for\r\ndeferment later on, we will look at the particular case and application,\r\nand as I mentioned earlier, we will review each case on its own\r\nmerit, on the basis of the individual's potential, performance and\r\nalso with input from MCYS. I am sure, if that application is made\r\nby Joseph Schooling, we will look at it appropriately. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ef61aded-f2a9-4816-b35b-8764e987738e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ef61aded-f2a9-4816-b35b-8764e987738e\"><!--a--></a>On the second query on\r\nallowing for exemption of National Service on the basis of sports\r\nachievement, I think this is a very fundamental issue because we\r\nhave National Service obligations and duties for every Singaporean\r\nmale. This is something we preserve. If we were to allow for exemptions,\r\nit would be very difficult, as I mentioned earlier, to preserve\r\nthat integrity of our National Service system, and that must be\r\nthe core basis upon which we make our considerations. I would not\r\nwant to have a broad-based policy to say that anyone who makes certain\r\nachievements can be exempted, but rather, I think, we should preserve\r\nthe integrity of our NS system so that it remains a core of SAF.\r\nBut from time to time, for individual cases, for exceptional sportsmen,\r\nas I mentioned earlier, we can and we have given flexibility for\r\nthem to pursue their aspirations to train and also to compete in\r\ninternational competitions. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-b0d16d22-2cf1-4c06-b1f8-bce747ec53a5\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-b0d16d22-2cf1-4c06-b1f8-bce747ec53a5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-26342747-73a4-426b-a1dd-efc770b36be9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-26342747-73a4-426b-a1dd-efc770b36be9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I have\r\nthree points to make.

The first point I would like to make\r\nis with reference to the Minister's comments. I completely acknowledge\r\nthe strategic considerations that necessitate a strong SAF; and,\r\nI think, many Singaporeans probably feel the same way. My only concern\r\nis this: I remember a few days ago, the Minister of Finance <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam\r\nspoke about looking for new ways to raise taxes in future to look\r\nafter the next generation of Singaporeans.\r\nMy concern is defence will always come in the gun sights of many,\r\nmany Singaporeans as the Ministry which has to reduce spending.\r\nIt is almost like a contradiction; on the one hand, we appreciate\r\nthat we need a strong SAF, but on the other hand, there is a danger\r\nthat it will always be in the spotlight for that reason. And people\r\nwill always come up with counter arguments about how we are not\r\nin an environment where this is Kuwait or Iraq, and so forth.</span>\r\n               </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-4c90960f-2c51-4707-9c30-65173830be5e\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-4c90960f-2c51-4707-9c30-65173830be5e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2017</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2c260aa0-d28b-47c6-9292-3440a0225174\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2c260aa0-d28b-47c6-9292-3440a0225174\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Please, I\r\nthink we got the point.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-9ee390ff-69ad-4275-81df-0c094bbb8c5f\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-9ee390ff-69ad-4275-81df-0c094bbb8c5f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-360f5778-47d0-4d19-afd9-be7eccbf73c1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-360f5778-47d0-4d19-afd9-be7eccbf73c1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: It is just\r\na concern I have and something that perhaps MINDEF may need to do\r\nmore to convince Singaporeans with.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-133f956a-6248-4c07-9ff9-949b58742301\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-133f956a-6248-4c07-9ff9-949b58742301\"><!--a--></a>Second point, I thank\r\nthe Minister for the remarks on Malay soldiers, and I think it is incredibly\r\nimportant that National Service be seen as a leveller in society.\r\nAnd so those remarks are very welcome. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2dc0d00e-c784-4596-83c5-820898646ad3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2dc0d00e-c784-4596-83c5-820898646ad3\"><!--a--></a>The third clarification\r\nis with regard to NS deferment.

I do\r\nnot think it is the case that every single unit has men of different\r\nages. They largely come in after school in the same cohorts and\r\ntherefore we do not want to have people comparing with one another\r\nwhen they can start their university studies. Our approach is to\r\nmake sure that students coming into NS are of the same cohort. When they\r\ncomplete their NS, they will have the chance, if they want to go\r\non to university studies, to pursue their studies at the university\r\nat the same time. That is why we have given flexibility for disruption\r\nfor students to make sure that this is possible. Before they come\r\ninto National Service, we also give them flexibility to defer up\r\nto the first education bar, as I mentioned earlier. So, these are\r\nconsiderations both before enlistment and towards the tail end of\r\ntheir National Service period where we also offer flexibility for disruption\r\nto ensure that students of the same cohort get into university at\r\nthe same time.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-409703ed-2eb6-43d9-837d-13ecb01c7e05\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-409703ed-2eb6-43d9-837d-13ecb01c7e05\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d9642711-6c81-45f5-ad71-3a3a6c4c1db3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d9642711-6c81-45f5-ad71-3a3a6c4c1db3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Er Dr Lee\r\nBee Wah, last clarification.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3613bd2b-1ec7-4507-acd2-e405ae52275c\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-3613bd2b-1ec7-4507-acd2-e405ae52275c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a63dc6f3-c043-4b1a-9be9-9125d7c37527\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a63dc6f3-c043-4b1a-9be9-9125d7c37527\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank\r\nyou, Sir.

The recent signing of the Partial\r\nVisa Abolition Agreement with Brazil to facilitate business and\r\ntourism flows is an example of our growing cooperation in this regard. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-8ee85dc7-48ed-4b74-ba11-a0c3a89f8130\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-8ee85dc7-48ed-4b74-ba11-a0c3a89f8130\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-7a6e2cee-d349-4d13-81bb-7c75892434d7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7a6e2cee-d349-4d13-81bb-7c75892434d7\"><!--a--></a>1.45 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b1f73308-70ae-4af0-bee9-34a936546a41\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b1f73308-70ae-4af0-bee9-34a936546a41\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Chairman, Sir, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Ong Teng Koon and Mr Alex\r\nYam asked for updates on how MFA is addressing the increasing demand\r\nby Singaporeans overseas for consular assistance, especially during\r\ntimes of emergencies.

Primarily, a lot of people will start taking notice of\r\nit if they see each other much more and there is greater physical\r\nconnectivity, and also if it increases trade and investment flows.\r\nSo, it has both direct tangible economic connotations and broader\r\nintangible cultural and social connotations to try and create a\r\ncommunity that is bonded together, not just by economics but also\r\nsocial and cultural value, and we are trying to increase it. It\r\nis going to take a lot of effort. Simple things \u2212 if we can have,\r\nsay, very good rail, air, sea and road connections all across ASEAN,\r\nit makes a big difference.

This would help reduce\r\nthe pressure on lawyers who turn away <em class=\"ph i\">pro bono</em> work and will\r\nfocus the effort on the firm and not just as individuals.

Every\r\nsingle lawyer must be imbued with the mindset that each has a role\r\nto play \u2013 from junior lawyer to senior lawyer and from every field\r\nof practice. Making it compulsory detracts from the spirit in which\r\nthis help should be offered. But the Government can help to make\r\nthis a reality. It should work towards providing a framework that\r\nwill allow lawyers to offer <em class=\"ph i\">pro bono</em> services and get recognition\r\nwithout being saddled with copious paperwork or heavy administrative\r\ncosts. For example, <em class=\"ph i\">pro bono</em> work should only benefit those\r\nwho need financial assistance. However, it would be onerous for\r\nlawyers and law firms to administer means-testing. If, for example,\r\nthere is a registry which can certify individuals who qualify for <em class=\"ph i\">pro\r\nbono</em> assistance, lawyers can take on these cases with the knowledge\r\nthat their goodwill is being extended to the right recipients.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2038</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-97384398-db23-4921-b72a-a97f444e10cf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-97384398-db23-4921-b72a-a97f444e10cf\"><!--a--></a>The Government can also\r\nhelp in other ways.

We need to ensure that there are\r\nsufficient lawyers in the system to practise in these domestic areas.\r\nOne source of lawyers would be graduates from non-recognised universities\r\nas well as those with external law degrees. Some of them have switched\r\ncareers midway. They, too, have dreams of practising law and have\r\nmade considerable efforts and incurred huge sums to obtain a law\r\ndegree. We should not deny them the opportunity to practise simply\r\nbecause of the school they went to. If the concern is to ensure\r\nthose who practise law are of sufficient calibre, we can address\r\nthat by making the Practice Law Course rigorous enough to ensure\r\nthat only those of the right quality will be called to the Bar.\r\nIn other words, we set the standards for admission and not rely\r\non someone else's examinations. I hope the Government will consider\r\nthis suggestion.

That mission of a legal aid bureau remains valid\r\ntoday except that the absolute definition of \"limited means\" must\r\nbe considered in the context of changing income levels. Applicants\r\nfor legal aid have to undergo means testing before such aid is granted. The\r\nmeans criteria has got two components, both of which must be satisfied independently.\r\nAn applicant's disposable income which is income in the past 12\r\nmonths before the date of application, after deducting prescribed\r\nallowances, must not exceed $10,000. In addition, as a separate\r\nhead, the disposable capital after relevant allowances must also\r\nnot exceed $10,000.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2039</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ac4d9da7-76dc-412d-aca4-6b7d70f290a8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ac4d9da7-76dc-412d-aca4-6b7d70f290a8\"><!--a--></a> Sir, I hope the Minister can consider\r\na review of the means criteria of both respects.

Anecdotally,\r\nthere have been instances where applications have been rejected\r\nwhere the disposable capital exceeds $10,000 on account of the surrender\r\nvalue of life insurance policies. Sir, the surrender value of $10,000\r\nis not very high and there is a growing number in our population\r\nwho own life insurance policies. More importantly, a legal aid applicant, unlike\r\nfor a motorcar or property, should not be expected to cash out on\r\nlife insurance policies to fund his legal expenditure.

In liberalising the\r\nmarket, many of the controls under the old Act were relaxed.

These include fees for loan administration\r\nand late payment charges. According to press reports, the Registry\r\nof Moneylenders received 67 complaints in 2010, up from 16 the year\r\nbefore.

Let me reiterate that the purpose\r\nof the rules is to prevent moneylending companies from using advertisements\r\nto stimulate excessive demand for loans by the public. In the past, we\r\npermitted licensed moneylenders to advertise in a variety of media,\r\nto allow the borrowers to compare terms across different moneylenders.\r\nHowever, we noticed that excessive advertising could stimulate excessive\r\ndemand for loans amongst those who did not truly require them, resulting\r\nin unnecessary debt. Furthermore, borrowers needed to check the\r\nRegistry of Moneylenders' website to determine whether the advertisements\r\nwere being put out by licensed or unlicensed moneylenders.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2688c27e-caac-4b1d-924e-0dd68e80b62e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2688c27e-caac-4b1d-924e-0dd68e80b62e\"><!--a--></a>We therefore put in new\r\nrules: if moneylending companies wish to advertise, they can only\r\ndo so through business and consumer directories of services, their\r\nown websites, and through advertisements at their premises. They\r\nare not disallowed from advertising; they are only disallowed from\r\nunsolicited advertising. The new rules help the public differentiate\r\nbetween licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. Now the public no\r\nlonger need to verify if the flyers, SMSes, emails or other forms\r\nof advertisements they received are from licensed moneylenders because\r\nthey can be sure that all such activities are not allowed. Such\r\nadvertisements would either be from licensed moneylenders operating\r\nin violation of our rules, or loansharks. Errant licensed moneylenders\r\nwould be investigated by the Registry and loansharks would be investigated\r\nby the Police.

I refer to the Minister's remarks on my cut. First,\r\non Internet regulation. The Minister said that somehow I suggested\r\nthat the review was a pretext to censure. I think I need to put\r\nin context of what I am saying one more time. I referred to the\r\nUS and its attempt to introduce legislation. I also referred to the\r\nProtection of Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy\r\nAct (SOPA). For example, PIPA, you have big corporate \u2212 US corporate\r\nand Internet corporate like Google \u2212 who actually spoke out against\r\nthis Act. I was coming from that angle where there is a concern\r\nthat while on the one hand, you protect intellectual property, such legislation\r\nto protect intellectual property could be used abusively and could\r\neven lead to censorship. That is where I was coming from. It was\r\na point that I made in good faith, and I am not suggesting that\r\nthe Working Committee somehow was looking for a reason to initiate\r\nlegislation which would lead to censorship. That is not where I\r\nwas coming from. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2ea6edc4-609a-4713-a43d-ce6e565fb14a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2ea6edc4-609a-4713-a43d-ce6e565fb14a\"><!--a--></a>On that note, can I just\r\nclarify, who are the members of this Working Committee that the\r\nMinister was referring to?

The real crux of the cut comes to the\r\npoint of the punishment with regard to the offence that Ramalingam\r\neventually was charged with, that is, the mandatory death penalty.\r\nAgain, in good faith, if the AG would decide to come out and say,\r\nlook, these are the reasons why we have decided not to review or\r\nto review, I think that may be helpful for the general public.

There is an inter-agency committee that is looking at\r\nit, and we must obviously look at the US' experience and the experience\r\nof the others. I made it quite clear that we look at it from the perspective\r\nof the economic impact; should we do nothing, but we also need to\r\nconsider the legitimate viewpoints that have been put up by users\r\nand others on a variety of issues. So, no decisions have been taken.\r\nIt is being studied and, as I have indicated, as and when we reach\r\na conclusion, then it will certainly be debated here. I only wanted\r\nto be quite clear that Mr Singh was not suggesting that we were\r\nusing it as a pretext to cut down on freedom of speech because Mr\r\nSingh combined the word \"pretext\" with \"freedom of speech\", and\r\nI understood him to be suggesting that this exercise may be construed\r\nby some as a pretext. I am glad he clarified that he holds no such\r\nview. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2058</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-546e9ea1-521e-4af3-97ab-a62ac56f2cef\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-546e9ea1-521e-4af3-97ab-a62ac56f2cef\"><!--a--></a>Second, on prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion. I went through it quite carefully. You have two possibilities.\r\nThe prosecution, under our Constitution, is given the discretion\r\nto make a decision on how offenders should be charged, and to make\r\ndistinctions. That exercise of discretion has to be made in good\r\nfaith, and it could be based on a number of factors, not all of\r\nwhich can be publicly disclosed, as the Court of Appeal itself recognised.\r\nFor example, it could rely on intelligence; there could be real\r\nreasons why one person could be treated differently from another,\r\nbut you cannot say it publicly. I said there are two possible models:\r\none, we require the prosecution either to publish guidelines, but\r\nMr Singh said that this is not what he was asking for, he wants\r\nthe AGC to explain publicly. But after a series of times when you\r\nhave explained publicly, it is as good as publishing the guidelines.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-115983f2-b310-4cec-ba6d-9afc214acfbe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-115983f2-b310-4cec-ba6d-9afc214acfbe\"><!--a--></a>So, it comes back to the\r\nsame thing, and you come back to this issue that there are all these\r\ntrade-offs. The prosecution sets out its decisions over a series\r\nof cases over many years. In such a case, we make a distinction;\r\nthese are the reasons for the distinction. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c10a426c-80f1-498e-a78e-190ca8c08787\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c10a426c-80f1-498e-a78e-190ca8c08787\"><!--a--></a>Then, you consider two\r\nalternate risks. The first risk is that the prosecution acts maliciously\r\nor wrongly in making distinctions between two people who ought not\r\nto be treated very differently. That is what society should guard\r\nagainst. That is a risk and I accept that it is a risk. On the other\r\nhand, there is a risk that criminals would start looking at those\r\npublished reasons and work out how the exercise of prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion will take place, and then they will start gaming the\r\nsystem.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-25e33d9a-fd0c-4f41-9ce9-496b54041ae5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-25e33d9a-fd0c-4f41-9ce9-496b54041ae5\"><!--a--></a>So, you have to assess,\r\nthis House has to assess, which is the more serious risk and which\r\nis better for society. My assessment, and the assessment of the\r\nmany professionals involved, is that the risk that the prosecution\r\nwill act wrongly is far less serious compared with the possibility\r\nthat people or criminals will start gaming the system. And, do not\r\nforget, ultimately, the Court of Appeal has indicated that where\r\non the face of it, the distinction that the prosecution makes between\r\ntwo different accused, if it cries out for an explanation and the\r\nprosecution offers no explanation, then the Court will make inferences.\r\nSo, that is a further check and safeguard as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f9e103c0-1fa1-4a9e-92bc-c82fadf47403\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f9e103c0-1fa1-4a9e-92bc-c82fadf47403\"><!--a--></a>We are all here trying\r\nto work towards a better criminal justice system, and we believe\r\nthe current approach strikes the appropriate balance between the\r\ndifferent interests involved.

First, in his\r\nresponse, he suggested that my description of the <em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em>case\r\nas a breakthrough was not quite fair \u2212 I am summarising what he\r\nis saying. Or rather, he mentioned that in the CPC review resulting\r\nin the Code in 2010, there had already been big steps taken towards\r\ndiscovery and so the <em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em> case is supposed to be part of\r\nthat, if I can just maybe dilute the statement.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1607890-da07-4fca-b2d1-f81fbf256353\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a1607890-da07-4fca-b2d1-f81fbf256353\"><!--a--></a>But does the Minister\r\nnot agree that actually nowhere in the CPC 2010, does it require in\r\nits wording for the prosecution to disclose to the defence, evidence\r\nwhich it does not intend to use as part of its case? That is not\r\npresent in any of the provisions, specifically in the CPC. That\r\nis why the <em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em> judgement talks about common law duty to\r\ndisclose evidence which prosecution does not intend to use. The\r\nsecond clarification which I like to seek from the Minister is whether\r\nthe Attorney-General's Chambers has actually issued any guidelines\r\nto the Police on what they should disclose to the prosecution, post-<em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em> judgement\r\nand, if it has issued some written guidelines, would it consider making\r\nthem public?

I think Ms Lim would recall a few weeks ago\r\nthat I said in this House that most lawyers would consider that\r\nthe <em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em> judgement rightly expresses the law, and that expresses\r\nmy view. In terms of what the CPC 2010 does, I made the point that\r\nit significantly enhanced the rights of the accused in terms of\r\nthe discovery obligations on both sides, and I think that made for\r\na better criminal justice procedure. It does not, in terms, in the\r\nstatutory provisions, refer to unused materials, but that was a\r\nmatter of debate during the Second Reading, and if I may quote myself,\r\nI think for the second or third time, as to what I said then \u2212 and\r\nMs Lim could not have forgotten it \u2013 this was what I said, \"Lawyers\r\nappearing in Court, whether prosecution or defence lawyers, are\r\nofficers of the Court. If they deliberately suppress material evidence,\r\nthey would be acting in gross breach of their duties. One cannot\r\nput forward evidence in Court while holding back other evidence\r\nwhich could put a different complexion on the evidence that is in\r\nfact being tendered in Court.\" I have no doubt that the Court would\r\ntake a serious view of such conduct. Ms Lim knows that the Court\r\nof Appeal referred to that statement and said that it expressed\r\ntheir view correctly and, in fact, relied on that statement to express\r\nits own views. So, the law is clear. We are both involved on the\r\nsame side, as it were, to try and improve the administration of\r\ncriminal justice. Whether or not it is expressed in terms in the\r\nStatute, this is what was said as being the law, and this was accepted\r\nby the Court of Appeal as being the law. There is no doubt about\r\nit. I think I have answered both Ms Lim's questions.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-a04e6f34-e4b5-44b2-b494-f2d7993a2c42\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-a04e6f34-e4b5-44b2-b494-f2d7993a2c42\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-624c8988-9891-4677-bf70-49849aba4fe4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-624c8988-9891-4677-bf70-49849aba4fe4\"><!--a--></a>3.30 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a0c4b0aa-d020-4de4-9881-c221a3e5aa7c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a0c4b0aa-d020-4de4-9881-c221a3e5aa7c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, the\r\nsecond clarification.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-09678942-8927-43fa-a89c-ee3defd59a65\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-09678942-8927-43fa-a89c-ee3defd59a65\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4326c387-cf08-444c-8eba-376da00cc96a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4326c387-cf08-444c-8eba-376da00cc96a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>\r\n                  </span>: In terms\r\nof Police guidelines, both before and post-<em class=\"ph i\">Kadar</em>, the approach\r\nthe prosecution has taken has always been that Police investigating\r\nofficers conduct the investigations and the material they collect\r\nis gone through for relevance.

Hawker centres are also a focal point of the neighbourhood\r\nand a community space for all to interact, regardless of age, race,\r\nreligion or background. As such, following the October 2011 announcement\r\nto build 10 new hawker centres in the next 10 years, there has been an\r\nenthusiastic response from the public.

First and foremost, the location and completion\r\ndate of the new hawker centres has been a subject of interest. We\r\nhave identified seven towns where new hawker centres will be located.\r\nThese are Bukit Panjang, Yishun, Pasir Ris, Jurong West, Admiralty,\r\nTampines and Punggol. Mr Cedric Foo has requested that a hawker\r\ncentre be built in the Pioneer SMC. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Liang\r\nEng Hwa have called for the Government to speed up the pace of development\r\nto meet the community's needs. We estimate that within the next\r\nfive years, these hawker centres will be completed and able to serve\r\nthe community. The centre to be built in Jurong West will be adjacent\r\nto Pioneer SMC, and can serve its residents. My Ministry will continue\r\nto work closely with the relevant Government agencies to identify\r\nsuitable sites in other towns to build more new hawker centres,\r\nshould there be a need. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aad0a664-1399-42d7-aa9c-cfc438305f69\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aad0a664-1399-42d7-aa9c-cfc438305f69\"><!--a--></a>Second, food price affordability\r\nin our hawker centres is an issue which members of the public and\r\nvarious MPs are concerned about. Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Gan Thiam\r\nPoh have shared some valuable suggestions. The 10 new hawker centres\r\nare expected to add about 600 hawker stalls to the market, which\r\nwill help better meet the demand for stalls and moderate stall rentals.\r\nThe new stalls will provide residents with more choices and in so\r\ndoing, ensure food prices remain affordable. Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested\r\nfixing prices that stallholders can charge as a way to ensure affordability.\r\nIn determining the price for his food, a hawker has to consider\r\nmany factors. These include stall rental, utilities, labour and\r\nraw materials. These factors differ from hawker to hawker, depending\r\non the type of food they sell. If the Government were to fix prices,\r\nthis would limit stallholders' income and affect their livelihood. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fdf9e566-b437-4ede-bedc-99eb24803eb1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fdf9e566-b437-4ede-bedc-99eb24803eb1\"><!--a--></a>Mr Gan and Er Dr Lee also\r\nsuggested that the Government control the sub-letting of stalls\r\nto reduce speculation which could raise rentals. This suggestion\r\nis aligned with the Panel's recommendations. Hawker stalls were\r\nset up to provide an opportunity for Singaporeans to run their own\r\nsmall business. As such, we agree that stalls should be personally\r\nrun, and should not be used for profiteering. I would like to announce\r\nthat for all new stallholders, full-day subletting and assignment\r\nwill not be allowed from 1 April this year. Existing stallholders\r\nwill have a three-year grace period to adjust to these new conditions.\r\nControlling the sub-letting and assignment of stalls will help to\r\nstabilise rentals, reduce costs for stallholders and achieve our\r\nobjective of food price affordability. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-61818e06-f89b-493b-a6c6-fd77645dd607\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-61818e06-f89b-493b-a6c6-fd77645dd607\"><!--a--></a>The Panel had suggested\r\nthat operating hours of hawker centres be extended, which would\r\nnot only meet residents' dining needs for breakfast, lunch and dinner,\r\nbut would also improve the vibrancy and viability of hawker centres.\r\nWe recognise it is not easy for a stallholder to operate a stall\r\nby himself or herself for all three meals. As such, from 1 April,\r\nwe have decided to permit joint tenancies and do away with the requirement\r\nthat each stall can only have a single tenant. We will also not\r\nset a reserve rent when tendering out vacant stalls. This means\r\nthat even if the bidding price is below market price, we will allocate\r\nthe vacant stall to the highest bidder, as long as there are competitive bids.\r\nTaken together, we hope that these measures will help to moderate costs\r\nin running a hawker stall, and maintain food price affordability. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2075</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-467732e8-ddf1-4ca9-b2e6-bc8aa73241b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-467732e8-ddf1-4ca9-b2e6-bc8aa73241b5\"><!--a--></a>Third, high standards\r\nof hygiene from our stallholders and hawker centres are key.

However, I am of the view\r\nthat the Government has over-taxed Singapore households for water\r\nconsumption. Besides charging water consumption by block, the Government\r\nalso imposes a water conservation\r\ntax, a sanitary appliance fee and a waterborne fee. While it is\r\nimportant to discourage excessive water consumption, the Government\r\nshould not take the punitive approach or slapping households with\r\nheavy tax measures, given that water is an essential commodity in\r\nevery household.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2078</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d80e1218-dd46-42da-be87-87c6e3dd7819\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d80e1218-dd46-42da-be87-87c6e3dd7819\"><!--a--></a>According to the Government,\r\nthe water conservation tax is to reinforce the water conservation\r\nmessage. However, charges for consumption are already based on block usage;\r\nhouseholds using more than 40 cubic metres a month are charged a\r\nmuch higher tariff. Is this not enough to reinforce the message\r\nof water conservation? The sanitary appliance fee and waterborne\r\nfee are to offset the costs of treating used water and for the operation\r\nand maintenance of the public sewage system. With the advent of NEWater,\r\nthe whole public sewage system is now part of operation for producing NEWater.\r\nThis is now a source of income for the PUB which resells the clean\r\nwater to households.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4e268e57-3059-4117-9c70-e7de34f2c2ca\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4e268e57-3059-4117-9c70-e7de34f2c2ca\"><!--a--></a>With this development,\r\nis it fair to continue charging households the same fee? Should\r\nthe Government not review the fees charged? Finally, we also have\r\nan issue of a tax-on-tax. Households have to pay GST for the water\r\nconservation tax. That is not right to further tax the people on\r\nthe taxes they pay. I urge the Government to consider removing the\r\nwater conservation tax and reduce the fees imposed on domestic water consumption\r\nto help lower the cost of living for Singaporeans. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-b773b97c-85bd-46a8-9cc9-6f9deedc5b7d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-b773b97c-85bd-46a8-9cc9-6f9deedc5b7d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-661b237a-0787-4cd8-90fc-3be62383329a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-661b237a-0787-4cd8-90fc-3be62383329a\"><!--a--></a>Active, Beautiful, Clean\r\n(ABC) Waters Programme</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f29ae33c-30bf-4db5-be0b-a2232bd8b928\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f29ae33c-30bf-4db5-be0b-a2232bd8b928\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's\r\nOffice (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman, Sir, a man\r\ndoes not exist in a vacuum.

First,\r\nto ensure that we continue to have a very high quality of life in\r\nSingapore; second, to do our part in an inclusive society, in particular,\r\nmeaning, to always leave a low cost option on the table and also\r\nprovide opportunities for fair wages and good jobs; and third, to\r\nmake sure that we have a sustainable future. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cc9b9aa9-63c2-49a1-abe8-e539c2e8a36e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cc9b9aa9-63c2-49a1-abe8-e539c2e8a36e\"><!--a--></a>Let me summarise our position\r\nas far as these three themes are concerned. First, on quality of\r\nlife, many Members have mentioned the absolute importance of maintaining our\r\nreputation for cleanliness. Senior Minister of State Grace Fu has\r\nexplained what we are doing. Basically to summarise: by having an\r\nintegrated cleaning agency that will be in charge of all public\r\nareas. It will take on the contracts of all the multiple agencies\r\nthat currently do the job. So, you only need one number, one contact\r\npoint. Secondly, to increase and step up enforcement. And Members\r\nhave asked for videos and evidence and the rest of it, and we will\r\ncertainly use the latest technology in order to take enforcement actions\r\nagainst killer litter and other types of anti-social behaviours. Thirdly,\r\nto also promote public activism \u2013 the sort that Miss Penny Low has\r\nreferred to \u2013 because we need all Singaporeans to become part of\r\nthe solution, to jealously guard our cleanliness. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2082</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-acf553b6-97c2-41e8-baa5-9499b65b77ac\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-acf553b6-97c2-41e8-baa5-9499b65b77ac\"><!--a--></a>On hawker centres, I am\r\nglad that this has been welcomed not only by all members in this\r\nHouse but indeed many; I think I can say, practically all Singaporeans\r\nout there.

And therefore we need to\r\nredesign jobs and we need to improve their productivity so that\r\nwe can give them a fair wage. And at the same time, while some of\r\nthat increase must filter back into prices; that firstly, people will\r\naccept that this is fair; and secondly, because we redesigned our\r\nprocesses, it does not necessarily lead to a sudden big jump in\r\nprices. But for a long while, we in Singapore have enjoyed First\r\nWorld living and paid very little relatively for human services\r\nbecause they have been getting Third World wages. So, in the name\r\nof an inclusive budget, this is the change that must come about\r\nand I hope Members of this House will support that. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-190cc95c-0943-4ef5-af0e-1cdd2a83a27e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-190cc95c-0943-4ef5-af0e-1cdd2a83a27e\"><!--a--></a>Let me now move on to\r\nthe question of a sustainable future.

Now, this\r\nis not just a matter of national pride, but indeed a source of competitive\r\nadvantage. And this is even more important now because we live in\r\na world with seven billion people, and for the first time in human history,\r\nmore than half of humanity lives in cities. Therefore, the way we\r\nstructure and organise ourselves, and the way we create a sustainable\r\ncity for the future, will be a source of competitive advantage and\r\nwill give us many opportunities for the future. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3cbcff7b-0ce9-4d95-9e33-80533d14990a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3cbcff7b-0ce9-4d95-9e33-80533d14990a\"><!--a--></a>So, I say this so that\r\nyou understand that our current environmental excellence was not\r\nachieved overnight but indeed over five decades, way before it was\r\nfashionable, Mr Lee Kuan Yew embarked on a clean and green Singapore\r\n\u2212 planted trees; made sure we did not pollute the air that we breathe\r\nand insisted on clean and safe water. And of course the iconic project\r\nwas the 10-year clean up of the Singapore River, which was formerly\r\nan open sewer. Most of us in this House would still remember the\r\npungent aroma of the Singapore River. Today, Marina Bay is an icon,\r\na magnet for the world in the midst of our new downtown.

In the long run, by\r\n2061, we expect that desalination will provide about 30% of our\r\nwater needs and NEWater will provide 50% of our water needs.

Well,\r\nthis entire chart which I have put up here, our plan for a 50-year\r\nsafe, secure, resilient supply of water for our country does not\r\ncome cheap. If you look at the annual report of PUB \u2212 which has\r\nbeen laid on the Table, so all Members should have access to it\r\n\u2212 it costs us basically $1.3 billion a year to run the system that\r\nyou see. Can it be done cheaper? Of course, it can be cheaper, and\r\nyou can cut corners and not be so worried about future reliability.\r\nBut this is what it costs. Mr Low asked about the charges. Again,\r\nif you look at the annual report, for the sale of water (that is,\r\nwater tariffs), for the financial year that ended March 2011, PUB\r\ncollected $674 million. For the waterborne fee and the sanitary appliance\r\nfee, it collected about $327 million. You can do a quick arithmetic.\r\nYou know that is nowhere near $1.3 billion. Even if you add the\r\nwater conservation tax, you still do not reach $1.3 billion. So,\r\nthe point is, we are not overcharging for water as far as funding\r\nthe system which we have.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-89e90ef9-8a88-499f-84ce-942453db706c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-89e90ef9-8a88-499f-84ce-942453db706c\"><!--a--></a>In fact, we are right\r\nhere in the Budget debate, because my Ministry, and in particular PUB,\r\nis asking Parliament to approve an operating expenditure of $224\r\nmillion and another $400 million of development expenditure for\r\nPUB because we need to continue investing in the system. So, I want\r\nto give the assurance to Mr Low and to all Singaporeans that we\r\nare not profiteering or overcharging for water. If you want to lower\r\nthe prices further, you can, but it just means we have to come back\r\nto Parliament and ask for more tax revenue. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7f4273ab-69f3-4eb9-a788-17b691f70bdf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7f4273ab-69f3-4eb9-a788-17b691f70bdf\"><!--a--></a>But I think it is very\r\nimportant for us to understand that we have to right-price water.

So please do not waste it.\r\nI did consider consolidating the sanitary appliance fee and the waterborne\r\nfee, as Mr Low suggested, to make it all a volumetric charge. But\r\nbecause this year's Budget's theme was \"An Inclusive Society\", when\r\nI tried to merge the sanitary appliance fee and the waterborne fee\r\ninto a single volumetric charge, I realised that would mean charging\r\nsmaller households more. In a sense, the larger households with more\r\ntoilets would get a bigger discount. I did not think that was right\r\nfor this year's climate, so I decided we would not change the two.\r\nBut I give you the assurance that the combination of the waterborne\r\nfee and sanitary appliance fee is still less than the cost of treating\r\nused water.

That should immediately tell you, it is\r\nnot a simple matter of how much it costs to buy water from Malaysia,\r\nor to even get water from a desalination plant. You have to pay\r\nfor the cost of an entire system. And this is all very transparent\r\nand it is laid before Parliament. It costs PUB $1.3 billion to run\r\na water system that we have today. And it is also equally transparent\r\nthat for a household that consumes less than 40 cubic metres a month,\r\nthe tariff is $1.17 per cubic metre, plus a Water Conservation Tax.\r\nSo, they will end up paying about $1.52 per cubic metre.

Euro V is better than Euro IV,\r\nwhich is better than Euro III, which is better than Euro II.

At the same time,\r\nin terms of nitrous oxide and particulate matters, they are allowed\r\na higher percentage compared to petrol cars. So, if we instil PM2.5 requirements\r\nfor all diesel vehicles, carbon emissions will go down.

It was stated that the typical range of mark-up was between\r\n5% and 30%, implying that the mark-up could be even higher than\r\n30% for certain drugs. The rationale for this is to help hospitals\r\nearn revenue to defray their overall operating costs. This latitude\r\ngiven to public hospitals results in the same drugs being priced\r\ndifferently at different hospitals. Take for instance the drug Mycophenolate\r\nmofetil (MMF) which is used in the treatment of auto-immune diseases\r\nand for transplant patients. One tablet of MMF 500 mg is sold at\r\n$2.75 at SGH and NUH but $3.31 at TTSH and $3.87 at CGH. The prices\r\nquoted are the subsidised prices for transplant patients under the\r\nStandard Drug List II, showing a variation of 40% among the public\r\nhospitals. I understand that non-transplant patients who need the\r\ndrug for other conditions would pay significantly more. This disparity\r\nof one tablet is magnified manifold for patients who typically need\r\nto take several tablets a day over a prolonged period. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-909ab556-46b7-4f0c-ae4c-67ccc1b75144\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-909ab556-46b7-4f0c-ae4c-67ccc1b75144\"><!--a--></a>Another example is the\r\ndrug Epoetin beta used in the treatment of anemia in kidney patients.\r\nThis is a non-standard drug but recently included for means-tested\r\nsubsidy under the medical assistance fund.

These achievements place us in the top quartile\r\nof OECD countries, on par with First World countries like France\r\nand Sweden. We have also shown steady improvement in other indicators,\r\nsuch as reducing premature mortality. For example, the death rate\r\nfor heart diseases among adult Singaporeans aged 35 to 64 fell from\r\n76.2 per 100,000 in 2001 to 49.9 in 2010.

The impact\r\nof it is on our capacity needs. Our population grew 25% over 10\r\nyears and will continue to grow over the next decade. Healthcare\r\nservices will have to grow too to meet the rising needs. Our population\r\nis also ageing very rapidly. By 2030, one in five Singaporean residents\r\nwill be aged 65 and above. This is a threefold increase to 960,000 elderly,\r\nfrom about 350,000 today. The ageing population will be a strong\r\ndriver for healthcare demand, as the elderly require a higher intensity\r\nof medical care. They are also\r\nlikely to stay longer once hospitalised. This will have tremendous\r\nimpact on the overall healthcare demand in future.

With increasing life expectancy and\r\nmore sedentary lifestyles, we are faced with a growing burden of\r\nchronic diseases.
