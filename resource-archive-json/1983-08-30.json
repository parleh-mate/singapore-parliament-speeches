Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. The Constitution of the NTUC provides for the Central Council to remove its Secretary-General. Why was it not possible for the Central Council to act within the Constitution rather than resort to you? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know if the Member for Anson is the legal adviser to the NTUC. But no doubt he \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ought to proffer his gratuitous advice to them. They did not ask him to interpret their Constitution for them. They came to see me because they felt that they would meet with someone who had an understanding of their problems, with someone who, apart from the constitutional relationships, would have their wider interests at stake and who, regardless of the constitutional position, would strive to bring about a situation in which the higher interests of the NTUC were advanced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not the slightest doubt that the Constitution would have provided them with all the legal means to get rid of a Secretary-General they did not wish. But that would not have provided them with a Secretary-General that they would wish, if it was Mr Ong Teng Cheong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know why it would not have provided them with a Secretary-General that they wished. They could have taken the necessary steps to have him elected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have your supplementary question, Mr Jeyaretnam? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is: Did the Prime Minister draw their attention to the Constitution and tell them that they were masters in their own house, that they should act within the powers given to them and not have the Prime Minister intervene in the affairs of the trade union movement? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson is envious of the rather friendly and fraternal relationships which I happen to enjoy with the Central Committee of the NTUC. It goes back many years. I do not have to tell them what they need do or need not do, and if they wish to seek my help I proffer it. If they act on their own, so be it. The reason why things have worked out well in Singapore is that both they and I have the good sense to know, first, what is the legal position; second, what is the ideal position. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Another supplementary question for the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, Sir.

These statutory bodies, like all other statutory boards, are exempted from payment of income tax under the Income Tax Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government directly holds equity, through the Minister for Finance, a corporation sole which invests directly in five operating companies and in three holding companies: Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd (THL), Sheng-Li Holdings Pte Ltd (SLH), and MND Holdings Pte Ltd (MNDH). THL, SLH, MNDH and their companies together \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> made an income tax provision of $259 million for the year ended 31st December, 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fiscal year 1982, the MAS paid dividends totalling $600 million. TAS is expected to declare a dividend of $20 million for the six-month period ended 30th September, 1982, i.e. immediately prior to its merger with the Postal Services Department. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holding companies have not paid their dividend to the Government, as all their surpluses are held for reinvestment. The holding companies received dividends totalling $121 million from their operating companies for the 12-month period ended 31st December, 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of fiscal year 1982, the total equity capital of the Government in MAS and TAS was $392 million and that through the Minister for Finance and in the holding companies was $1,726 million. All these entities are wholly owned by Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual yields on capital for 1982 from dividends were 10.3% for MAS, and 13.7% for TAS. The rate of dividend paid by MAS took into account not only Government's paid-up capital but also Government's cash balances in the current accounts with the Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividend yields for the three holding companies were nil, The yields for the operating companies were nil for 34 companies (including eight which have yet to commence operations), 1% to 10% for five companies, more than 10% but less than 20% for 10 companies, and at least 20% for nine companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am gratified that the companies which are owned by the Government, including the statutory bodies mentioned by the Minister for Finance, are not losing money and are not being subsidized. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I inquire of the Minister for Finance whether he will in future include dividends from these companies in the Budget Statement so that we will be able to fathom out how the revenue which the Government collects comes from. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Secondly, may I inquire of the Minister whether it is the policy of the Government to have Government companies muscling into the private sector at all? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I did not get the last part of the question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Put in simple words, Sir, is it the policy of the Government to allow companies owned by the Government crowding out private companies? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I must inform the Member for Rochore that the companies are run on the basis of private sector companies, i.e. their budgets are drawn up by their boards of directors. I do not know to what extent their budgets follow Government budgets but they are certainly not regulated in the sense that Government budgets are rigidly enforced. At the end of the financial year when the results become apparent, it is only the results, the balance sheet and profit and loss statements, that are made public by these companies, and I think rightly so. The public is then able to judge whether the companies have performed profitably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the last part of the question whether the private companies are being crowded out, if that is the case we would not have a vigorous private sector. I think their vigour can be seen by the Stock Exchange quotations every day, and while there are Government companies in the list of publicly listed companies, I do not think they are a majority in this Exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has missed the point.

So in a sense it is not exactly a Government controlled company, although 20%, of course, is a fairly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> considerable share. In the case of PIE, the answer is yes, it is a Government company. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Is the Minister for Finance aware that the PIE made history last year by flying in 1,500 breeding pigs by Jumbo jet?

PIE provides some of the supplies for feeding our army and other armed forces. If the private sector is equally viable, equally able to supply foodstuffs, I see no reason why they should not also compete with the PIE. The PIE is treated, I think, like any other Government company.

It is not practical to completely eliminate the odour nuisance. However, the nuisance can be minimized through better housekeeping at the farms and improved waste treatment and disposal methods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day, the odour is less noticeable because the malodour is dispersed and diluted with rising warm air. However, during the evening when the temperature of the air is cooler at the ground level, the malodour does not disperse easily and the smell nuisance becomes more noticeable. Farmers have, therefore, been advised not to wash or flush their pig pens towards the late afternoon to minimize the nuisance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further reduce odour and pollution caused by pig farms, farmers in designated pig farming areas are also required to install waste treatment plants by 1984 to treat their waste properly.

Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, 130 Anson Road is a 3-storey pre-war building. It was acquired by the URA in March 1981. The fire occurred at about 11.00 a.m. on 20th May, 1983. At the time of the fire, 20 persons were living on the premises. There was also a souvenir shop. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire was put out within half an hour by the timely arrival of the Fire Service. The rear portion of the first floor and the whole of the second floor were completely gutted by the fire. The souvenir shop suffered only slight damage. One occupant was injured. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police have investigated the incident. The cause of the fire could not be established. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Would the Minister of State agree that fires do not start by themselves? They start either because someone has thrown a lighted cigarette end or something else to start the fire, or there is a burnt wiring hanging loose somewhere. Is the Minister also aware that the fire started about 10 minutes after a resettlement inspector had inspected the first floor, apparently to put up notices? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek clarification as to what is the Member for Anson suggesting or inferring in the second part of his supplementary question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am not insinuating or inferring anything, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Have they not been able to find what was the cause of this fire? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the supplementary question. The first part of his supplementary question was whether it was not true that, in any case of a fire, it is usually started by someone or something. That is obvious. Just to give him some information. Causes of fires for the year 1982, for example, could be classified into 14 categories: light thrown down, electrical origin, exposure to sun's rays (which caused 786 fires), overheating of food, naked lights, sparks, incendiary, overheating of machinery, spontaneous ignition, explosion, children playing with matches, lightning and others. Some causes cannot be discovered even after a thorough investigation. In 1982 there were 97 instances of fire, the causes of which even after a thorough investigation could not be detected. But this 97 was out of a total of 6,000 fires. So the overwhelming majority of fires in Singapore are thoroughly investigated and the causes established, except for a handful of unknown causes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the second part of his question. First, obviously there was an innuendo by his brief reference to the fact that there was a URA resettlement officer at the scene 10 minutes before the fire. It was only after I had asked for a clarification that he generalized and asked whether there was a thorough investigation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that all cases of fire are taken seriously by the Singapore Fire Service and the Police, and all cases are thoroughly investigated. This was so in this particular case also. On the day of the fire, the Singapore Fire Service thoroughly investigated and had a field report. They saw a large number of boxes on the second floor. It was suspected that those boxes might have contained a flammable substance. Thereafter, the Police took over. The substance and the boxes were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for a thorough analysis. The Department of Scientific Services reported that their chemical analysis showed no \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> indications of flammable substances such as kerosene, petrol or whatever. All the persons concerned who had to be interviewed were interviewed. So that should put an end to any innuendoes or inferences by the Member for Anson. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the House to understand that the Police and the Singapore Fire Brigade are baffled by this fire? They cannot even suggest a possible cause for the fire. And did they take a statement from this officer? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears that the Member for Anson arrived here with an answer in his mind, which does not tally with the answer that I have given.

These proposals are being studied in greater detail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such time that we can come up with adequate legislation on noise pollution, the Police can take action against persons who cause serious noise nuisance, such as those who use their indoor electronic amplification equipment in an inconsiderate manner. Action against persons who cause noise nuisance with their electronic amplification equipment can be taken under the Minor Offences Act or under relevant provisions of the Penal Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noise pollution is very subjective, the Police however have been exercising a great deal of discretion in enforcing the law. I am glad to report that members of the public have generally been cooperative and have respected Police warnings to reduce noise levels. However, action will be taken against those who ignore such warnings and deliberately persist in causing annoyance to their neighbours or who are a nuisance to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no quick easy answer to the problem of noise pollution in Singapore. Owing to our high population density and the cultural background of our people, community noise is a particularly difficult problem. However, it can be minimized by inculcating in our citizens a greater sense of civic consciousness and consideration for others. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINIMUM SPEED ON EXPRESSWAYS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will consider imposing a minimum speed for vehicles on an expressway which has three or more lanes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Expressway Traffic Rules 1982 were being formulated, the question of a minimum speed on our expressways was considered. It was decided, after studying the problem carefully, not to impose a minimum speed limit on our expressways. There were three main reasons for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, due mainly to the constraints of space, our expressways run through densely populated areas. Where they are close to residential areas, pedestrians cross the expressway. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our expressways also have bus stops, U-turns and traffic lights which, from an ideal viewpoint, expressways should not have. The PWD is taking corrective action on these problems but this will take time to implement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two reasons, it may be impractical and somewhat dangerous to impose a minimum speed limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add a third reason. The Expressway Rules prohibit bicycles, tricycles, motorcycles with side cars, L-drivers and all other vehicles whose maximum speed limit is 40 km per hour from using the expressways. In other words the law already prohibits slow moving vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressways are new to Singapore. With the passage of time, we hope that our motorists will learn how to use expressways properly. The Traffic Police has provided extensive publicity to educate the motoring public on the correct use of expressways. At the same time, strict enforcement action has been taken against those who road-hog as can be seen from the fact that from 1st August 1982 to 31st July 1983, 4,215 persons were booked for road-hogging on expressways and 899 were warned. I might add that the PWD has also agreed to put up road signs along expressways requiring slower drivers to keep to the inner lanes. Let me assure the hon. Member that we will keep the situation under review. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINIMUM AGE FOR CONCESSIONS AT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GOVERNMENT OUTPATIENT DISPENSARIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Health what is the rationale of fixing 65 years as the minimum age for senior citizens to qualify for concessions at government outpatient dispensaries and if he will consider lowering the age to 60 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Howe Yoon Chong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because compulsory retirement has remained the same at 55 or 60 years and because CPF savings can be withdrawn at 55 years, the local concept of old age or definition of \"senior citizen\" has not changed ever since the 1950's when the average life expectancy was around 60 years. Yet all this while there have been dramatic advances in medical science and technology. There have been vast improvements in economic and social conditions. Few of us ever realize that by defining a person to be \"old\", we often make that person \"old\" when, in fact, he or she is still young. The main reason why the Ministry of Health uses 65 years and over as the qualifying age for concessions is therefore to prevent people who are not yet \"old\" from being made to feel old by our society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the true facts? Today, Singaporeans have an average life expectancy of 70 years for males and 73 for females. Actuarial calculations show that a Singaporean who is today 60 years old can, on the average, expect to live another 15 to 19 years. There is medical and scientific evidence to confirm that people who have maintained good physical and mental health should not be \"old\" in their 60's or even in their early 70's, but only in the late 70's and beyond. Therefore, the term \"old\", \"elderly\", or \"senior citizen\" should correctly apply only to people who are in their late 70's. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, accept that among our population in Singapore there are many people who have had a very difficult life and who might not have taken as good care of themselves as they should. The Ministry of Health, in deciding to grant concessions, has adopted 65 years as the qualifying age for a person to be termed \"old\" or \"elderly\" also to keep in line with international practice. The United Nations' agencies and most industrialized countries accept 65 and above as the basis for the term \"old\" or \"elderly\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the answer to the hon. Member's query whether the Ministry will consider lowering the age to 60 years for concessions at Government outpatient clinics and dispensaries is therefore \"No\". The likelihood is that when we further improve our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> health care and living conditions and when life expectancy goes up, the Ministry may think of revising the qualifying age upwards and hopefully raise it to 70 or 75 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister consider lowering the age to 60 years as the qualifying age for concession at Government outpatient dispensaries? This would be considered not as a sign of the person being old or elderly but more as a sign of appreciation of the person's contribution to the country. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the appreciation would be that we hope he will keep good health. Therefore, giving him any indication that can lead to self-pity is not appreciation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PHARMACIES IN GOVERNMENT HOSPITALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Health (a) how many pharmacies are operating in the government hospitals; (b) whether they are adequately staffed with qualified personnel; (c) how many of these pharmacies are operating outside office hours; and (d) whether there are plans to expand these night pharmacies, particularly those in the Accident and Emergency units, in the interest of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a pharmacy in each of the nine Government hospitals. Three other smaller hospitals which do not have a pharmacy of their own obtain their drugs from the pharmacy at a nearby hospital or at an outpatient clinic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pharmacy is staffed with one or more qualified Pharmacists, depending on the size of the hospital. They are assisted by trained Dispensing Assistants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the nine pharmacies operate beyond normal office hours. One in the Singapore General Hospital which works from 7 am to 7 pm daily. After 7 pm, a skeleton staff from the pharmacy is stationed at the Accident &amp; Emergency (A&amp;E) Department where pre-packed medicine is issued. The other pharmacy with extended \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hours is at Toa Payoh Hospital which is open daily from 8 am to 6 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no immediate plans to expand night pharmacies. Present practice is to stock all the A&amp;E Departments with commonly prescribed pre-packed medications for use when the pharmacies are closed. At the Singapore General Hospital A&amp;E Department, any emergency case requiring a drug outside the pre-packed range will have to be supplied by the main pharmacy. In the other hospitals, A&amp;E cases requiring certain drugs urgently outside office hours will obtain such supplies from the wards. All acute hospitals stock sufficient supplies of medicines in the wards and Intensive Care Units for emergency purposes. There is a pharmacist on call all the time. The pharmacist oncall can still be summoned if necessary. One pharmacist is on-call every night. These arrangements have served the needs of the hospitals adequately. There is therefore no necessity for the Ministry to expand night pharmacies at the A&amp;E Departments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COUPON PARKING SCHEME</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Administration)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will elaborate on the administration of the Housing and Development Board/Urban Redevelopment Authority coupon parking scheme, in particular, the safeguards to ensure that the motoring public is not unduly penalised by any administrative error. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yock Suan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, the Coupon Parking Scheme was implemented in February 1980. Under the Scheme, a motorist who parks his vehicle in a coupon parking place must display a valid parking coupon or coupons according to the prescribed parking rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the Scheme is implemented fairly and that the motoring public is not unduly inconvenienced or penalized, HDB and URA have adopted the following measures and safeguards: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) \n  <i>Outlets for Sale of Parking Coupons</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the 50 URA car park kiosks and 32 HDB area offices, 644 other establishments spread around the island have been secured for the sale of parking coupons. These outlets include petrol kiosks, grocery shops, eating houses, theatres, etc. The large number of sale outlets ensure that coupons are made easily available to motorists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) \n  <i>Signboards at Coupon Parking Places</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parking places are provided with prominent reflective signboards at the entrance. Signboards are colour-coded and clearly specify the type of parking scheme available and the rates in force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) \n  <i>Grace Period</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On expiry of coupons, a 5-minute grace is given for motorists to remove their cars or to display additional coupons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) \n  <i>Thorough Check for Coupons</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking Wardens have to check thoroughly for the display of coupons not only at the front windscreen and the driver's window, but also the dashboard and all other windows. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) \n  <i>Accuracy of Time</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking Wardens are required to synchronize their watches with the TELECOMS Time Announcing Service before they assume their enforcement rounds. This is to avoid disputes with motorists over the time indicated on their coupons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) \n  <i>Flexibility in implementing Coupon Parking Rules</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking Wardens have the discretion to be flexible in dealing with emergency cases. Motorists who are genuinely aggrieved by any action taken against them can appeal to senior officers at the URA or HDB Car Parks Division. If their grievances are found to be genuine, the penalty against them may be reduced or waived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorists themselves also have to be blamed for any inconvenience if they do not display their coupons properly. In many instances, coupons on display are partially hidden by other articles or are placed in the midst of outdated coupons on the dashboard. The Parking Warden who cannot find the correct coupon will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> naturally summon the motorist.

Members will recall that the rationale of the establishment of the Provisional Authority was to minimize \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> delay once a firm decision to build the MRT had been taken. This move has paid off. The project is now progressing rapidly. Tenders have been invited for several major contracts. The first set of civil contracts is expected to be awarded next month. Construction work will then begin a month or two later. It is a credit to the Board and Management of the Provisional MRT Authority that we have managed to come this far so quickly. Although the Provisional MRT Authority has been administering the implementation of the project since Government took a firm decision in May last year, it does not possess the legal powers necessary to actually build and operate the MRT. Hence it is necessary to introduce fresh legislation to establish a permanent successor to the Provisional Authority and to vest it with the necessary powers. This permanent successor will be called the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill deals with preliminaries. Part 11 deals with the incorporation, functions and powers of the Corporation, and Part Ill sets out the financial provisions. These are, by and large, fairly standard and straightforward in the sense that broadly similar provisions can be found in the legislation of other statutory authorities. Part IV of the Bill sets out the special powers required for MRT implementation and the methods for exercising them. Parts V and VI deal with compensation rights and procedures. And finally, Part VII sews up the Bill with various miscellaneous provisions. I shall now highlight some of the more important provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 sets out Government's decision to pay from public funds the full one-time cost of building and equipping the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 imposes a duty on the Corporation to ensure as far as possible that, taking one year with another, its revenue is sufficient to meet the cost of operating the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 to 32 of the Bill set out the specific powers required by the Corporation to construct the MRT and the pro- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cedures for exercising them. These powers include : \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the power to acquire land compulsorily under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the power to enter private and State lands for the purpose of building the MRT. This includes the right to bore tunnels through private property as well as the right to span or support viaducts over private property. In exercising this power, the Corporation is obliged to show clearly on maps the precise area within which the MRT may be built, and to make these maps available for public inspection. Moreover, the Corporation is required to serve at least two months' notice on owners and occupiers of private lands before exercising the power of entry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, I should add that the right to drive a tunnel through private property or to build a viaduct above it is necessary because of the strict geometric constraints on the MRT line. This is unlike roads or sewers which can be shifted this way or that, relatively easily. However, the Bill does provide a remedy in that the owner of any land affected in this way can, if he so wishes, require the MRT Corporation to buy over his land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the power to enter private buildings lying within 150 metres from the MRT alignment to carry out inspections, surveys and remedial works where necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the power to request the diversion or removal of utility lines, fences and other obstructions lying in the way of MRT construction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts V and VI of the Bill deal with the issue of compensation. The circumstances in which it can be claimed as of right are described in the Schedule to the Bill. These include compensation for displacement from lands and buildings affected by MRT construction and compensation for structural damage to buildings arising from MRT construction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Railway Compensation Board will be established under clause 39 to arbitrate on disputes pertaining to compensation. This would be similar to the Tenants Compensation Board. The advantage of this approach is that it would be procedurally simpler and less costly than going to court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Nevertheless, the Bill does allow for appeals to the High Court against the Compensation Board's decisions on points of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the passing of this Bill, the Provisional MRT Authority Act will be repealed and the MRT Corporation will take over all its assets, liabilities and responsibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PUBLIC UTILITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.45 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Act was last amended in 1978. The present Bill seeks to amend the Act to give the Board flexibility in changing the designation of its departmental heads, to increase the penalties prescribed for offences under the Act, and to update and tidy up the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill proposes to amend section 13 of the principal Act to empower the Board to change the designation of the departmental heads of Chief Financial Officer, Chief Electrical Engineer, Chief Water Engineer and Chief Gas Engineer. These existing titles imply that only persons with the respective professional qualifications can head the departments. At this level, however, managerial and leadership qualities are as important as professional qualifications. The proposed amendments will enable the Board to change the designations of heads of departments to suit organizational needs. This flexibility will enhance the development of management personnel in the PUB. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill also seeks to increase the penalties for offences under the Act. Such offences include illegal tapping of electricity, gas or water, and tampering or damaging the Board's property, including electrical cables and meters, water pipes and gas mains. These offences have caused interruption to supplies and considerable inconvenience to the public. As the penalties were last reviewed in 1974, they are no longer a deterrent. The proposed maximum penalties are generally in line with those of other statutory boards. There are other minor amendments for the purpose of updating and tidying up several provisions in the Act. These are detailed in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL STATISTICAL COMMISSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OF SINGAPORE (REPEAL) BILL 1</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.48 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple Bill which seeks to repeal the National Statistical Commission of Singapore Act, 1971.

The punishment for such an offence is a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both such fine and imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now ask this House to approve by resolution, pursuant to section 11(4) of the Military Manoeuvres Act, without amendment, the Firing Ground Rules, 1983, as it did for the Pasir Laba Firing Ground Rules, 1966 on 21st December, 1966. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 11 (4) of the Military Manoeuvres Act (Chapter 232), resolves that the Firing Ground Rules 1983 published as Notification No. S 86 in the Government Gazette Subsidiary Legislation Supplement No. 16 of 15th April, 1983, as contained in Paper S.L. 55 of 1983, be approved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>4.02 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MEDISAVE SCHEME</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health (Mr Goh Chok Tong): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The Motion reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House having noted the National Health Plan -- A Blue Paper by the Ministry of Health, February 1983 as contained in Paper Misc. 4 of 1983, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) approves in principle the Medisave Scheme which will enable Singaporeans to set aside their own savings to meet future hospitalisation expenses; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) recommends that there be periodic reviews in the implementation of the Scheme and that adjustments be made when experience shows this to be desirable. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health care concerns everyone. Healthy living, preventing people from getting sick and curing those who do is the responsibility of the whole State and all its citizens. It is for this reason that I have moved the above Motion only after many months of public discussions on the subject. The National Health Plan, in particular the concept of Medisave, was finalized as a Blue Paper only after my Ministry has brain- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stormed it with a cross-section of people - medical personnel, members from the mass media, employers, workers, unions, and the consumers as represented by the CCCs and the RCs, and others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then, it is not in its final form. After its release in February this year, we have received further feed-back, and studied the considered views submitted to the Ministry by several individuals and organizations. My Ministry thanks them all for their valuable contributions. I hope hon. Members will be free this afternoon with their observations, suggestions, criticisms and comments on how to improve our health system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common observation about the Blue Paper is its brevity and lack of details. The broad brush strokes were deliberate. The Paper deals with ideas and not the minutiae of health care. Its conciseness makes for easier reading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Plan aims: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to build a healthy, vigorous, active and physically fit population through healthy living, prevention of illnesses and community care; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to give all Singaporeans proper access to efficient health care services at a cost the individual and the country can afford. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just a pious hope. It can be achieved with realism and compassion. The heart of the National Health Plan is the Medisave Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conceiving the Medisave Scheme, the details of which are spelt out in Part 11 of the National Health Plan, we have the advantage of perfect hindsight. Many developed countries, for example, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Australia and Japan, have implemented different variations of a liberal \"cradle to grave\" health care service. We have studied the efficacy of these welfare models 30, 40 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> years after their birth. We have seen their quick degeneration from their first youthful blush to their present pallid state as the cash runs out, and the services run down, unable to meet ballooning demand. We will be silly not to inoculate ourselves against this nationally disabling, degenerative disease. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is my evidence for this indicting statement against the health care systems of the advanced countries? I have here a World Health Organization publication written by an English freelance journalist, Peter D. O'Neill, entitled \"Health Crisis 2000\". Let me quote from its opening two paragraphs: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As Europe enters the last two decades of the 20th century, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has no option but to warn that there could be a health crisis by the year 2000 unless radical steps are taken by the public, the professions, industry, and the governments of the Region. This is no idle warning. A careful analysis of trends in health and disease, made over the past three years by representatives of the medical profession and the health ministries of the Region's 33 Member States, has produced ominous signs that our health policies since the Second World War have set us on a dangerous course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glittering attraction of high technology and the public's demand for \"miracle cures\" have meant that we have almost abandoned the principle of self-care in a \"caring community\". We have inflicted wounds on ourselves, in the belief that science, doctors and hospitals would find a cure, instead of preventing the very causes of illness in the first place. Of course we cannot do without the medical care facilities that actually save life, but let us be clear that they do not add to our \"health\" - they stop us dying. Hospitals can only \"cure\" probably between 10% and 20% of disease. Instead of promoting health and preventing disease, we have invested the bulk of our health budgets in \"disease palaces\" [in other words, hospitals] which have really only cured our acute illnesses. Moreover, some countries have not only built hospitals that are too expensive for the return they give in terms of health, they have also built too many.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europe faces a health crisis because the welfare model of free medicine has not worked. Free medicine does not reward those who make an effort to stay healthy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really no such thing as free health care - whether in Britain, West \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Germany or USA. Every person who works pays for the country's health care system. If he gets it free at the point of utilization, it is because he has paid in advance for it, either in the form of taxes, compulsory national health insurance, or voluntary health insurance. The result of this illusion of \"freeness\" leads to unrestrained growth in demand, spiralling health costs and of course queueing for services. In Britain, a patient was diagnosed as a case of detached retina two years ago. She still has no appointment for her eye operation. She is forced to wait for treatment from the National Health Service simply because she cannot afford the cost of private treatment, and there is a long queue waiting for eye operations. (This case was reported in the 11th August issue of The Listener.) In a sense, she does not have proper access to the National Health Service even though she has paid for the service, in advance through taxes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for escalating health costs, the governments concerned can only watch helplessly as more and more resources are poured into what seems like a bottomless pit. I will give you two examples: one from Britain and the other from West Germany. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Britain</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1965, Britain spent a total of o1.3 billion on the National Health Service. In terms of per capita expenditure, it was o23. As a percentage of her Gross Domestic Product, it was 4.1%. The two key figures are o23 and 4.1%. In the year 1981, the total expenditure went up by about 10 times to o13.4 billion. Per capita expenditure has, of course, shot up by about 10 times to o240. And in terms of percentage of her GDP, it has gone up from 4.1% in 1965 to 6% in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>West Germany</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Germany has a Statutory Health Insurance System which covers 90% to 92% of the population. The insurance system is financed by contributions in the form of earmarked payroll taxes as a percentage of wages, 50% from employer and 50% from employee. In terms of percentage to wages, i.e. the rate of contribution as a percentage of wages, in 1970 it was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 9.2%. As a percentage of West Germany's Gross National Product, it was 3.7%. In 1982, the contribution rate went up to 12.1% of wages. As a percentage of GNP, it was 5.7%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have never been enticed by the permissive \"come hither\" look of free medicine and free beds. We have always resisted their seductive advances. We charge for outpatient treatment and 'C' Class beds. We have, therefore, restrained spurious growth in demand for medical attention. We have kept costs down to 3.3% of Government revenue, and 1.0% of our GDP. This had misled many a knowledgeable person to conclude that there is no need to revamp our present health system. I have heard arguments that in fact we have underspent on health, and can even afford to increase or subsidize health expenditure further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is myopic perception. It is like arguing that we need not save for old age because we are working now. It is like believing that there will be no rain tomorrow just because the sun is out today. Is there any divine law to guarantee that our economy will grow by at least 8% per annum for the next 20 years? Will the number of people over 60 years of age remain forever small? In 1957, only 3.8% of our population was over 60 years of age. Today, it is 7.4%. In the Year 2000, it will be 10%, or one in 10 persons will be over 60 years of age. This Government has an abiding duty to look after the health of Singaporeans, not only today, but 20, 30 years down the road and way into the 21st century. Young Singaporeans are born today. When they grow old, they must not be made to wait one or two years for an eye operation, a hip operation, or for hernia repair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we discharge our duty? First, we have to maintain medical standards, both now and in the future. Then we have to make sure that there are enough funds to pay for good doctors, nurses, facilities and medicine, in order to maintain standards. If the Treasury runs dry, standards must go down as doctors and nurses leave for greener pastures in the private sector, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> even overseas. When standards go down at the public hospitals, the average Singaporean must suffer, like our British patient with the detached retina who cannot afford the cost of private treatment. We have no intention to let him suffer in the future. We must therefore save when we can, put a few dollars aside every month when we are working, save as an individual, as a nation. This is the basic idea of Medisave - to provide funds for our citizens to pay for their future health needs, for them to buy an umbrella when it rains; and even before it rains. If our Singaporean patient has funds in his Medisave account, he can even choose private treatment if he likes! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must all be more aware of the true cost of medical treatment. An appendix operation costs about $2,000. But the patient pays only about $200. We therefore think surgery is cheap. It is not! There must be a better relationship between fees charged and the cost of treatment. Otherwise, the health care service must sooner or later run out of cash. And when cash runs out, standards must go down. We have no choice but to gradually reduce the level of subsidy. But let me make it clear that in absolute dollars and cents, there will be no reduction. In fact, we expect the absolute quantum of overall subsidy to go up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. For every $100 we spend on a 'C' Class patient, we now charge him approximately $10. We subsidize him $90. We will not reduce the present absolute quantum of subsidy of $90. But if costs go up to, say, $115, there must be a more equitable sharing of the increased cost of $15. Let us say he bears $10 and the Health Ministry or the State $5. He will now pay $20. We continue to subsidize him $95. This will go on each time there is a cost increase. In other words, although the patient will have to pay more, the subsidy will in fact also increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I emphasize that this formula for cost-sharing will not be implemented mechanically and insensitively. How much of the cost increase at each occasion should be assumed by the patient will have to take into account his ability to pay. We will have to see the balance in his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Medisave Account; of course on a national basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also add that we are talking only of annual operating costs. Capital expenditure on land and hospital facilities will not be reflected in hospital fees. Each hospital bed costs about $400,000. This cost will not be amortized or defrayed into fees. Capital expenditure will continue to be funded from general revenue. So will expenditure on prevention. In 1982, the Ministry spent $304 million on health care. Fees collected from OPDs and hospitals amounted to $72 million or 23.7% of the Ministry's operating cost. Even with increased fees, we do not expect the absolute gap between expenditure and revenue of $232 million to be reduced in future. We expect it to increase because of expenditure on preventive programmes and the chronic sick. This gap will continue to be funded by general taxation, which means those who earn more pay more. The lower income wage earners will, therefore, still be heavily subsidized for their health needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was our intention to implement Medisave from 1st July this year. This would have meant increasing CPF rate from 45% to 50%, distributed as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Ordinary account              :  40%\r\n\r\n     Special account               :   4%\r\n\r\n     Medisave account              :   6%\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due regard, however, was given to the state of the economy, the capacity of the employers to absorb the cost increase, and the desire not to reduce the employees' take-home pay. Accordingly, CPF rate has gone up by only 1%, to 46%, distributed as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Ordinary account              :  40%\r\n\r\n     Special account               :   6%\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for us to defer the implementation of the Medisave Scheme until the CPF rate has gone up to 50%. To do so is to hinge Medisave on the uncertainty of future economic performance and wage increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the Medisave going immediately, the Government is allowing the Special Account to be used for Medisave pur- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> poses. However, at the age of 55, an account-holder must leave behind a minimum of $10,000 or the actual balance in his Medisave Account, whichever is less. This will allow wage earners immediate access to funds for their hospitalisation needs, because you can now make use of your Special Account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry fully sympathizes with the small minority who, through no fault of their own, may not have enough in their Medisave Accounts to meet their entire hospitalisation needs. They need not lose any sleep over this. They will be treated first and allowed to settle their hospital bills from future contributions into their Medisave Accounts. Moreover, the genuinely poor needing frequent or prolonged hospitalisation can seek a remission of their hospital bills. In other words, within the limits of our resources, all Singaporeans will have proper access to medical treatment, regardless of his ability to pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Medisave as presented in the Blue Paper is not something fixed and final. We will work it and through actual experience identify the problem areas. It has, therefore, the flexibility to accommodate further refinements and additional features. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave is not the panacea to our health care problems. But it will at least ensure that the vast majority of us have enough funds, at all times, to pay for a high standard of hospital care. For those who do not, the State provides the safety net. May I conclude by emphasizing that it is not the present we are worried about. It is the future. We want to ensure that Singaporeans will always have a good health care system to turn to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> At this stage I shall take the Suspension so that Members can think about what they are going to talk.

But going through the 17 letters submitted to the Ministry of Health plus the numerous letters written in the press on this subject and this morning's centre page on Medisave in the Straits Times, I found no advantage, as nearly every aspect on the Health Plan that I would like to comment has been covered. While I would like to think that this is a deliberate attempt by the Ministry of Health to diffuse the issue by the time it reaches Parliament, I must admit that this has been a good PR exercise and I join my colleague from Alexandra in saying, \"if we can do it with Medisave, why not with all major Government policies?\" The Second Minister for Health has said that the heart of the National Health Plan is the Medisave. I beg to disagree. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Over-emphasis on Medisave</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has asked this House to approve in principle the Medisave Scheme after having \"Noted the National Health Plan\". This is an assumption that this House has already accepted the first part of the National Health Plan i.e. the Health Development Strategies. There is an over-emphasis on Medisave, little realising that this part is equally important, if not, more so, because this is where the money from the Medisave will be spent. Too much attention has been paid to the funding of our health care system, and less attention has been paid to the Health Care Delivery Planning. I think before we expect the people to share in the funding, it is only right that we ask ourselves why is the cost of medical care going up? Is it because of increased demand, or is it because of abuse of our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system, or is it because our system is inefficient, or is it because of increased services, building new hospitals, new technology like ultrasound, brain scan or expensive programmes like test-tube babies? We must address ourselves these questions because all these and many more will increase cost which the consumers will ultimately have to pay either through higher taxation or higher Medisave payment. It is in this context that I want this House to know, before approving the Medisave Scheme, so that the Ministry of Health will always be on their toes to check areas of medical programmes and care that cost a lot more but has little benefit to society, and also, whether Medisave money, if spent on other programmes would be more profitable to society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore leave the detailed discussion on Medisave to my other colleagues while I examine the many areas in our Health Services which will directly or indirectly affect Medisave. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Quality of Care</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the first part of our National Health Plan, i.e. the Health Development strategies, I am impressed by the statistics showing how many hospital beds we need, how many nurses, doctors, dentists, pharmacists we require. by the year 2000. How many outpatient dispensaries will be closed down and how many new polyclinics and hospitals will be built. Little mention is made, however, on the quality of future medical care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality of medical care is not necessarily related to cost. It involves more than that. It involves careful planning and training of the appropriate personnel to look into the needs of the patient. Today if you are ill and you have to see a doctor at our outpatient clinics, you will have to wait for a few hours to be seen by a harassed doctor. Investigations are minimal and patients have to go to a few designated centres or even hospitals for further investigations. This is not quality. If you are discharged from hospital after a stroke and sent home, what home support have you if your children are working, and what community support have we? None, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> except our Home Nursing Foundation. This is again not quality care. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Community Health Team - An Essential Link</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to discharge patients to their home environment for further care, you must have a team at the other end to take over. I see no provision in the National Health Plan except that the Ministry of Health will play a catalytic role. This is vague. I think the Ministry of Health must not merely be a catalyst but must be directly involved in starting a \"chemical\" reaction. Direct involvement of the Ministry is vital in the provision of better health care. To this end, I would like to suggest the formation of the Community Health Team. This Team would be part of our Outpatient dispensary set-up, or by itself. It can consist of doctors, nurses, social workers, health educators and volunteers from the community. This Team will be responsible for providing support to the discharged patient, the chronic sick, the aged, and the aged infirm. If I were half-paralysed, I would be happy to know that the community has a unit for the continuation of home treatment waiting to look after me when I am discharged from hospital. If I were a lonely old man with little home support, living in a 3-room HDB flat, I will be most happy to know that the community geriatric services will be knocking at my door to see to my basic needs. I would just refer Members to Appendix I (Cols. 115 - 116). The details are all there, so I will not talk more on that. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830830/19830830-HA-0430115.htm\">Appendix I - Community Geriatric Services (Cols. 115 - 116)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the next question that the Minister will be asking is \"At what cost?\" Of course, the initial sum to set up such an organization will be high because you have to train doctors to be community doctors, nurses to be community nurses. Here again, I refer Members to Appendix II (Cols. 115 - 116) on community nurses. Of course, you need the supporting staff and a place to operate. In the long run, (we are talking about a 20-year Plan) this well-organized Team working in close association with our improved outpatient dispensaries, general practitioners, volunteer organizations, religious bodies, and community \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> leaders will set a high standard of care for our chronic sick, the aged, the aged infirm, disabled people and the recent hospital-discharged patients. We would have shifted from an expensive area of health care, i.e. hospital care, to a non-expensive area with no loss in quality of care. But most important of all, it will provide the link between the hospital, the outpatient clinic, the voluntary organizations, the general practitioner and the patient. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830830/19830830-HA-0430115.htm\">Appendix II - Community Nurses (Cols. 115 - 116)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the future of our health care in the community will depend largely on this total concept of community nursing. This is because of our aging population and its related problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Community Hospitals</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not quite sure that we should set up community hospitals of the kind the Ministry wants. Firstly, setting up hospitals, community or otherwise, is an expensive affair. Then the running and maintenance of these hospitals is going to be a problem. The Ministry hopes that GPs will run these hospitals. I do not see how the busy general practitioner, working from 8.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m., can run these hospitals. This is an important practical point. The specialist doctors are mainly concentrated in the city area where private hospitals are nearby. I therefore do not think they will want to use these hospitals with such limited facilities. Moreover, patients' preference for well-equipped, better hospitals must be taken into consideration. Patients prefer to go to the Singapore General Hospital instead of Alexandra Hospital or Toa Payoh Hospital or Tan Tock Seng Hospital. What more with Community hospitals which cannot match up to these hospitals in terms of equipment or reputation? Moreover, our size, the smallness of our republic makes travelling to our hospitals not a big problem, unlike countries like Britain where community hospitals are needed to serve communities in far-away areas. Lastly, our National Health Plan has provision to build hospitals in Bedok, Woodlands and Zhong Bang, when the need arises. I therefore question the need for building community hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Upgrade our Outpatient Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the intention of the Ministry to build community hospitals to take care of the simple surgical cases and less serious medical ailments, I would suggest that we reorganize the present Outpatient clinics to meet such needs. We have this basic infrastructure of Outpatient dispensaries spanning across our country covering practically every corner of the island. Let us build on it to provide a higher standard of care with doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, X-ray services and proper laboratory services. I know the Ministry is doing up some Outpatient dispensaries into poly-clinics and even building new ones but you must be bold enough to provide more facilities in these to include, amongst others, physiotherapy, psychiatric, geriatric and day-surgery with operating theatre to do simple surgery like the lumps, bumps, cysts, cuts, fractures and even ligation and abortions (with apologies to the Member for Whampoa). Even beds for the elderly could be provided who might otherwise have been forced into hospitals. We could invite doctors to join your set-up by renting out spaces to them. We must look into the better use of our outpatient clinics rather than building community hospitals. Hospital care as the Minister has pointed out, costs more than primary health care. This cost will be ultimately passed on to the taxpayer. Our Second Minister for Health who is also the Minister of Defence and the present Minister who was the former Minister of Defence must be aware that the front-line soldiers play an important role in our defense system. I am asking them to apply this strategy to our health system. Beef up our primary health care and the Community will be better off in the long run. In Finland, for example, the Finns realised that hospital-centred care was simply incapable of meeting the challenge posed by the high-adult mortality and chronic morbidity and that more money had to be spent in the community where some of the aggravating circumstances of the illnesses were created. They have set aside approximately one-half of the 6.2% of GNP spent \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on health care in the country on primary health care and health education. They have the lowest infant mortality rate in the world. I refer you to Appendix III (Cols. 117 - 118). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830830/19830830-HA-0430117.htm\">Appendix III - Expenditure on hospitals and primary health care, Number of new posts in primary care (P) and hospital services (H) between 1975 and 1979 (Cols. 117 - 118)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Private Practice &amp; NHP</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is much talk about involving the private sector in our future medical care. This is well and good, but I wonder if the Ministry has examined whether the private sector can discharge such a role effectively. At present the care provided by General Practitioners is basic. It is effective but not efficient. Unless the Government is prepared to open its facilities at the Outpatient Clinics to these doctors, their contribution will not change much from the present in the Year 2000. Moreover, HDB encourages individual practitioner, by its present method of tendering, and solo practitioner will not be able to contribute much because of the very nature of his work. The Ministry of Health in the 20-Year Plan has realized this and will be working with HDB to solve this. May I suggest that HDB build clinic complexes to encourage group practice? If it is the Government's intention to encourage private practice, then in line with this trend, the University of Singapore Medical School must include a Department of Community Medicine to train medical students to be community doctors. Only then can GPs in private practice be able to participate in your programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of expertise in the private sector. It is a sheer waste of medical talent and expertise to find top surgeons doing bread and butter surgery when they were once doing renal transplants and complicated surgery. Similarly, it is disappointing to find top Obstetrics and Gynaecology consultants doing abortions mainly, when once they were teachers of our medical school imparting their skills to medical students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Health Plan must examine how we can maximize this potential source of valuable manpower by inducing them back to teach and train our medical students on a part-time basis. I know that there are at present some private consul- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tants in the hospitals but I ask them: How do they fit into the hospitals? Many feel that their expertise is not fully utilized. Why is this so? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Hospital Doctors and Medisave</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to draw your attention to how hospital doctors' behaviour can affect Medisave. While doctors' services account for less than one-fifth of the grand total health expenditure in many United States Hospitals (I do not have the Singapore Figures), doctors control or exert very strong influence over most of the rest of the health care spending, especially hospital spending. Physicians recommend hospitalization and admit patients. They recommend and perform surgery. They order and perform other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. They prescribe drugs and they decide when to discharge patients. Blumberg, in 1979, has estimated that physicians control 70% of total health spending. Thus, physicians' propensities to prescribe costly services are of particular interest from the point of view of total health care spending and medisave. I quote from page 173, paragraph 2 of THE HEALTH, ECONOMICS AND HEALTH ECONOMICS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Inducing providers to curtail the rendering of those services which yield very low or no marginal health value may be a far more effective and acceptable way to limit spending than attempts to reduce the price or unit cost of services, or to make consumers pay a larger fraction of the price\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you evidence of what I mean by low marginal health benefits. Hutter and his colleagues at the Massachusetts General Hospital, in 1973, reported a study of early hospital discharge from myocardial infarction, that is, heart attack. Uncomplicated patients were randomly assigned to either a 2 or 3-week hospital stay. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no difference between the 2-week or 3-week patients in frequency of return to work, anxiety or depression, heart condition or survival. A more recent study tried sending half the uncomplicated patients home on the 7th day, with similar results. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later two British groups, Mather et al in 1976, and Hill, Hampton and Mitchell, in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 1978, did randomized studies by comparing home and hospital care for acute heart attacks and found no discernible benefit from hospital as compared to home care for most patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and many other studies have shown that there is a substantial body of evidence that suggests that, at least in many cases, higher utilization rates yield zero, or possibly negative health benefits. In other cases, higher utilization rates yield marginal benefits that are too small or too elusive to be measured. In still other cases, it appears that utilization of costly services has been expanded in the absence of evidence of efficacy. Allow me to explain. You must have heard of coronary artery bypass graft surgery now in vogue. Many top politicians in the United States have a bypass done for their ailing heart. It is a costly medical technology put into widespread use before its efficacy was established. This operation was first introduced in the late 1960s. By 1977, its annual volume exceeded 70,000 at a cost of roughly US$l billion. The Veterans' Administration started a randomized clinical trial in the early 1970s with more than 1,000 patients, roughly half of whom were treated medically, the other half with this operation. The results were published in 1977 by Murphy et al. Surgical treatment was found to prolong life for the 11% of patients having diseased left main coronary arteries. In the rest, there was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two treatment groups at follow-ups, 21 and 36 months after entry into the trial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable debate over the significance of these results. Some have argued that surgical technique has improved considerably since the trial was conducted, and that there are important quality-of-life benefits not measured by survival rates. Be that as it may, the point remains that a great deal of spending took place in the absence of any scientific evidence that this use of resources produced better health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we may proceed with the hypothesis that it is possible to reduce the utilization of some hospital services with- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> out harm to the health of the population served. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors, the providers of our health care, have therefore a crucial role to play. They can create demand, as I said, by unnecessary admissions to hospitals, unnecessary procedures, both medical and surgical. This is due in part to the training he receives as a student. He has been taught to cherish clinical freedom. The relationship between the patient and the doctor is sacrosanct and cannot be interfered with. The doctor is concerned that his patient receives the treatment appropriate to need, regardless of cost, and from his point of view it is not in his interest to become involved in the issues of resource allocation, financial stringency and priorities. Provided he receives what he needs to care for his patients, that is his only concern. Doctors, therefore, are the prime users of resources in the Health Services and, as such, must be involved in the management of these resources. The University of Singapore Medical School should, therefore, teach medical students the concepts of cost-effective practice. I am serious about this. Medical students are often asked by their professors, \"Why didn't you order these tests?\" rather than \"Why did you?\" I remember an incident in my houseman days when a fellow houseman ordered so many X-rays for a person who was involved in a road traffic accident. That person only suffered simple abrasions and cuts. When I asked him why, he said this was to make sure that our superior did not ask him why he did not do this or that. Of course, you could say that this particular doctor is inexperienced and was working under pressure. But the point I am making is that, unless the provider of the health system is involved, all our attempts to cut down costs will be negated by their non-involvement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must realize that Singapore is an international city. Ships call at our harbour, planes land on our international airport, cars come in from the causeway. We are vulnerable. Diseases from these countries can easily be spread to us. Constant vigilance in these areas must continue to be top priority. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> import workers from other countries. Therefore they must be thoroughly screened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our number one major cause of hospitalization is accidents, poisonings and violence. This is followed by diseases of the digestive system, diseases of the circulatory system (including the heart and blood diseases), diseases of the lungs and infective and parasitic diseases. These illnesses are to a large extent environmental and socio-economic in origin. It follows, therefore, that our water supply and sanitation must always be of a high standard, our hawkers must be clean. Singaporeans must be advised to live an easier and less stressful lifestyle: smoke less, eat properly and keep away from too much alcohol. Pumping more money from our Medisave to an expensive area of care like hospitals and sophisticated programmes must, therefore, be weighed carefully. On the other hand, community based projects like Community Health Team working with a better equipped and planned Outpatient dispensaries may be better in the long run. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fellow MPs, you must remember that this country is free of small pox, polio, cholera, diphtheria and malaria, because these diseases were eradicated by basic primary health care team of doctors, nurses and community leaders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the National Health Plan and Medisave with some modifications. I agree with the Second Minister for Health on the dangers of third party payment like insurances. I concur with the Minister the need for sharing health costs and that Medisave will to a certain extent provide for this. However, I fear that Medisave may not be enough for the chronic sick and some form of insurance coverage may be necessary. We could either allow a percentage of a person's Medisave for this insurance, similar to the home insurance scheme we have for our HDB flat owners. Lastly, Medisave will have many problems during its initial stages and I am glad that the Minister recommends that, I quote him, \"there be periodic reviews in the implementation of the scheme and that adjustments be made when experience shows this to be desirable\". In a nutshell, the Ministry must be flexible. Don't quarrel or haggle over \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whether a person has enough Medisave or not when he is in pain. Treat him first and ask him to pay later. If Medisave starts off on the wrong footing, then all this PR work will be wasted and the Ministry will be in trouble. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your patience in listening to my fairly long discourse. \n  <br>5.30 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not go over ground which has been so admirably covered by the Member for Ayer Rajah. I share with him on the desire to have to push or reinforce preventive medicine. But I also would like to remind the Member for Ayer Rajah that we are human beings made of flesh, and flesh has its weaknesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ayer Rajah is a professional. Therefore, I would not argue with him over those professional points that he has raised. Instead, I will cover the financial aspects of Medisave. I feel that Medisave is being treated in isolation. Medisave is, as I pointed out in the Budget debate, a part of the Government budget and our budgets have been in surplus every year. It is misleading of the Minister for Health to go around the country and create the impression that we are encountering problems like the United States which face running deficits because of expenditure on social security programmes and defence. In fact, the only social security programme we have in Singapore is health. It is wrong to forget that even now patients make direct payments for medical treatment and hospitalization. It is wrong to create the impression that we are distributing health care for free. Payments made by patients constituted 24% of the recurrent expenditure of the Ministry of Health in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is politically unpleasant to announce periodically increases in hospital charges. It was my job at that time and I can recollect the castigation that I received in the newspapers each time I raised the rates. But this is unavoidable. Costs are bound to go up with each year if for no other reason than because of annual increases in wages. And this applies not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> just to the Ministry of Health but equally to all other Government bodies and departments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health cannot avoid revising medical and hospital rates. The CPF account is a convenient means to collect hospital charges. For that, the Minister for Health has to be congratulated. I know there are bad debts incurred by the hospitals. These bad debts will now disappear. But for that matter if hospital cost will have to be paid from savings, why not allow patients to pay the cost of hospitalization from their savings accounts in the POSB? And there are over two million accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of health care facilities must be accepted as a social responsibility. It is not that an individual who has the misfortune to be inflicted with some particular disease is solely responsible for searching the facilities to cure his illness. This is a social responsibility which is accepted by governments all over the world. This is part and parcel of the organization of individuals into societies. It is a measure of the degree of civilization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem which we are faced with is the cost of financing. Who is to pay? I believe it is wrong to say that the Government is paying for the cost of medical care. The costs of government are borne by taxpayers, us, either through direct taxation, like income tax, or indirect taxation. So the problem really is reduced to finding an equitable distribution of revenue in the Consolidated Fund to meet different objectives and purposes of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave calls for direct payments by patients to the cost of running 'C' class beds. The recurrent expenditure of the entire Ministry of Health, i.e. the cost of administration, the cost of outpatient departments, the cost of all first, second and third class wards in all hospitals, was $257 million in 1981. Let us assume that the operating cost of 'C' class beds is 70% of the total expenditure, which is a generous assumption. This means that 'C' class wards cost $180 million. The revenue received by the Ministry of Health in that year, 1981, was $62 million, leaving a deficit of $118 million which was met out of the Consolidated Fund. However, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Payroll Tax collected was $106 million in 1981, a sum sufficient to meet the deficit for operating 'C' class wards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the House to 1982. The Ministry of Health expenditure was $321 million. And again assuming that 'C' class wards cost 60%, the sum would be $192 million. Payroll Tax collection alone was $161 million, leaving a deficit of $31 million which was more than covered from revenue collected by the Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are faced with, therefore, is the problem of apportioning of responsibility and cost. The propaganda put out by the two Ministers for Health is that medicine is a commodity that is consumed. I think it is a very dangerous assumption to believe that persons love to fall ill, that they go around shopping for sicknesses in the supermarkets, or that they like to spend their weekend in a hospital as if the hospital is a hotel. Or that the food served in the hospital is a la carte or buffet. That is perverse propaganda. And, therefore, Medisave is now being treated as a consumption tax. This makes it difficult for one to support the arguments that have been put forward for Medisave. I do not know why the Member for Ayer Rajah was sold over so easily that he has already expressed his support without first listening to the rest of us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What percentage of the cost of running 'C' class wards can be equitably borne by direct taxation such as Payroll Tax? What percentage of payments is made directly by patients? The proposal behind Medisave is that patients will now make their payments not directly to the hospitals but through their CPF accounts. It is like the check-off system that we have in the trade unions. Now we are being checked-off out of the CPF account. The snag of this scheme is that employers would be asked to contribute to Medisave in spite of the fact that they already have their own private health scheme for their employees. And, in effect, this would mean increasing their Payroll Tax by 3%, even though this contribution does not directly go to the Consolidated Fund but into the employee's CPF account. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that in presenting Medisave, the Minister has given no consideration to fundamental points. First, in what direction can the Ministry of Health reduce costs? The Member for Ayer Rajah has very eloquently explained that demand is not generated by patients, and I believe him, particularly patients in 'C' class wards. It's the doctors who create demand as he has explained. Can the Minister, a political appointee, control his doctors? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point No. 2. What is the projection of future revenue that will be collected by the Ministry of Health? In other words, in what direction is he anticipating the rate of increase in the cost of running the Ministry and therefore the increase in charges that he must pronounce periodically, next year or the following year? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point No. 3. Can shortfalls be made up from the Consolidated Fund without calling for further contributions to the CPF which is now at 46%? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point No. 4. Can part of ,the interest earned on CPF accounts be credited to the cost of hospitalization? In 1982, the interest credited to members' accounts was $846 million which is $187 million more than in 1981. The more CPF you pay the more interest you earn. And if, of course, a part of this CPF money is invested overseas where interest is higher than the 6 1/2% we earn, perhaps that additional interest will help to pay the cost of hospitalization. But contributors earn only 6 1/2%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No firm can afford to have two parallel medical welfare schemes. The trade unions want Medisave and of course they want the existing scheme under the general collective agreement they have made with the employers. The Minister for Health, since he is not the Minister for Labour, has of course ignored all this. The buck is passed on to the employers. Believe me, I have not turned capitalist. I am not speaking on behalf of employers. There are big employers. There are small employers. There are small businesses who hire two persons, maybe even three persons. They have to contribute to all the taxes imposed by the Minister for Finance, including CPF, the Skills Development Fund and Payroll Tax. And these small \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> businesses which pay Skills Development Fund do not see anything coming out of the Skills Development Fund. A barber shop applies for a Skills Development Fund. How can he develop the skills of his barbers? It is the small businesses that are subsidizing the big businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So also is this Scheme. It is a taxation, and it is a recessive tax for the simple reason that those who are at the lower income level, because their CPF contributions are lower, will have to pay the full amount, whereas those with higher incomes do not pay the full percentage of their income towards the CPF because there is a ceiling. It is recessive. I feel that all this is a very short-sighted myopic view. As payroll costs rise, so also prices must increase. And this will have an escalating effect on the cost of living and demand for more wages, and more contribution to CPF. I know for sure there was one businessman who preferred to leave Italy to start a restaurant in Saudi Arabia, for the simple reason that he just could not afford to pay the social security cost imposed on him by the government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the Minister for Finance earlier this afternoon to find out what revenue Government companies and statutory bodies were contributing to his Consolidated Fund. The Minister was a bit quick in the reply. I was not sure of the figures I jotted down but, if my additions were correct, their contribution was more than the recurrent expenditure of the Ministry of Health. So why have more contributions to the CPF? Has the Minister for Health, who was in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, who was in cahoots with the Minister for Finance, taken the trouble to investigate how he is going to get the money to run his Ministry? The first responsibility of the Minister for Health is to ensure the availability of health care services. That is his first responsibility, that he must go round and nag at the Minister for Finance for the money. But he is taking on the job of the Minister for Finance. I totally disagree with the approach of Medisave. However, as a former Minister for Health, I share with these two Ministers for Health their concern for preserving the existing standard of health care; preserving - I am not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> saying improving, the emphasis is \"preserving\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to visit a patient in a Class A Ward in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, paying full charges. The patient asked for a receptacle so that she could throw out her vomitus. She was given a half-cut discarded plastic bottle which was so small that the vomitus spilled all over the bedsheet; and that was a discarded plastic bottle, in a first class ward. What are we doing with the revenue collected? It will be profitable if the two Ministers were to take time off and inspect the wards. But I question, and I do not agree with the Minister for Health just now when he extrapolated or tried to extrapolate European and American cost of health care into the Singapore situation. I do not agree with him. I have read all the literature. Behind the statistics that he produced just now, there are many pressures, vested interests, interest of pharmaceutical departments, manufacturers of hospital equipment, which have pushed up health care costs in the West completely out of proportion to the rate of inflation. And I worry still that we will soon have an Audit department in the Ministry of Health that may well do nothing but spend its time trying to do an audit on the costs in our own hospitals. I would suggest to the Minister for Health that it will be profitable for him and his staff to study all these underlying causes in the West so that we avoid them in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Paper that has been presented to us this afternoon is out of date. It is said in the Blue Paper down there that contribution to the CPF is 45%. It is 46% now. If it is so out of date so soon, I am alarmed whether in five years' time the 50% rate of contribution to CPF would not also be out of date. Together with contributions to payroll tax, skills development fund, any additional payments to the CPF, particularly from small businesses and partnerships, the increases in payroll tax cost will be a real deterrence. The Blue Paper is not binding on the Minister for Labour, or even a future Minister for Health or a future Minister for Labour. The Minister for Labour is responsible for the Central Provident Fund, not the Minister for Health. The resolution that he has set out before \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the House does not spell out limits. It is a blank cheque. As far as the Minister is concerned, he gets his 6%. My confidence, Mr Speaker, in resolutions has not been strengthened, particularly when a resolution moved by the Minister for Education in 1979 in this Chamber has not been honoured. I shall abstain from the voting in the resolution. \n  <br>5.52 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a doctor and therefore I cannot speak like the Member for Ayer Rajah in the capacity of a professional analysing the Medisave Scheme. And I also cannot speak like the respectable Member for Rochore who could draw on his vast past experience in administration and as an academician to analyse the NHP from the economic and health point of view. I can only look at this issue through a simple conception. I feel we should understand what is most important in one's life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember when I was young my life was not easy because I lived in a difficult environment. I could not have good medical care, and I had also seen in many places, not in Singapore, that many people had not been given medical care as we have been enjoying in Singapore. Sir, what I mean to say is that living in this world if one could be in a situation where the young are nurtured and the able-bodied can be of use while the aged can be accorded security, then one should feel very lucky and contented. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we who live in Singapore look around we will see that a normal child could have the opportunity to go to school or to be taken care of and to live healthily and develop healthily. We find that he is actually in a fortunate situation. If a youth is healthy, both mentally and physically, it is not difficult for him to get a proper job. And if an aged person is alone and without any support or if he lacks financial means, in the present circumstances in Singapore, he still has the opportunity to be accepted into a home for the aged to pass his twilight years. In other words, in our present circumstances, we have almost \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> solved all the basic problems of livelihood of our people here. Therefore, I agree with what our Minister has said earlier that if we are talking of some issue which pertains to a situation 10, 20 or 30 years later, a National Health Plan for the future, then I will support it because what will happen in the future nobody can tell. But if we are prepared now, then no matter what happens in future we shall be ready to meet it. There is the saying \"The weather is unpredictable. Fortune or Misfortune may befall any person at any time.\" So if we are prepared for any eventuality, it is much better off for all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this. In 1959 when the MP for Rochore was also on the scene, our Government had the foresight to raise the 5% CPF contribution some 20 years ago to 46% today. This has given many people in the middle and lower income groups in Singapore the necessary funds from the CPF to buy flats. Had the Government not implemented such measures before, then many of our people today would face housing problems because prices of houses and commodities are very expensive. If people in the middle or lower income group have some savings to help them meet expenses that will arise in future due to illnesses and so on, this will only help them and not harm them. Let me give an example. In the past 18 months constituents of two families came to see me at my meet-the-people sessions. They showed me two hospital bills. Each bill ranged between $200 and $400, both under $500. They were not able to pay these bills. To you, Sir, or to any Member here in this House a few hundred dollars is a very small matter. But outside this House, there are many families who have only one person to depend on for a living. If the bread-winner goes to hospital because of illness, then he is out of job for the time being, and when his condition improves and is recuperating in his home, the hospital bill will then come to him for payment. In such a difficult situation, how is he going to support his family? Therefore, I fully sympathize with the two families. So if there is a requirement of 6% contribution to savings in one's CPF to help one to pay the medical bill, is it not good? To those unfortunate people, I think this 6% saving is good for them and it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> does them no harm. If anyone should feel unhappy, such as those whom the Member for Rochore has mentioned, i.e. the businessmen or bosses who think they have already given a certain degree of care to their employees in their own organizations and are now required to contribute further to the Central Provident Fund, then, of course, they would not be happy. Like anybody else, they do not like to put more money into somebody else's pockets, as they think they have already contributed 22% to the CPF. But to the employees, they do not have to incur any additional contribution, any more than just about 1% to the 23% contribution which, including the employer's contribution, will give them about 6% of the wages as savings in the CPF. Therefore, the Medisave Scheme appears to be very good for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to give two more examples to illustrate how the Medisave Scheme needs some consideration or review just as what the Member for Ayer Rajah has said. I give an example. There are four members in a family - a mother with three children. Two of them have moved out. Only one small daughter is living with her mother and is dependent on her for her livelihood. Not long ago the little girl met an accident and stayed in the hospital for some 3 months, after which the hospital sent a bill to them. The mother is unable to pay and the two other children who live outside are also not willing to pay. Under this Scheme, it is not possible for members of the family to help pay the hospital bill. Is it reasonable? I hope the Minister will give consideration to it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example pertains to an aged person who is ill and is suffering from diabetes. Every day he has to go to the clinic for injection and medication and he has to pay for it. In the meantime he could not work and so he could not afford to go on living in this way because of the great cost of medical treatment. Also he could not seek to die. Under such circumstances, could he make use of his Medisave savings to pay for his medical expenses when he is not hospitalized? Would the Minister consider this problem? The hospital would not accept him and he has to pay, what is he going to do? Although this Medisave Scheme may benefit the majority of the people in the long run, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there are special cases. There are exceptions. The Minister should be cautious and pay some attention to such cases, particularly when such cases touch upon one's life and death, just as the Member for Rochore had mentioned. The Minister should consider that to save a person's life is worth all the effort. So we should try to save a person's life first, before thinking of asking for payment so that we do not make people think that \"I have money in the CPF savings, yet when I am sick and almost dying I could not make use of the money, so what good is it to me?\" Then there is no sense of security. On the other hand, if he thinks the money is of use to him and is of benefit to his members of family and he is also sure that after 10 or 20 years this saving will be good for his family, just like the CPF which after a period of accumulation can be used for purchasing of flats, on this account I will support the scheme. \n  <br>6.04 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, after listening to the Member for Rochore I am afraid I have to tell the Member for Ayer Rajah that I might be the second person to disappoint him today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have read the National Health Plan. I have gone through it not with the skilful eye of a doctor but I look at it from the point of a layman - how the National Health Plan would affect the common Singaporean. None of us would quarrel with the basic objectives of the Plan, and that is, \"to build a healthy, vigorous, active and physically fit population\" on the basis that prevention is better than cure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on reading the Plan in great detail, I have found some points where it is difficult to reconcile myself with. The Plan starts off by expressing the Government's concern over the increasing demand for our health service. In reading this I could not help but detect that our Government is highly suspicious of our people in that it believes that there is this increasing demand because it is highly subsidized and therefore people tend to abuse the system. Members will recall that some years ago this same argument was used to put forward the case for an increase in charges at the A &amp; E Departments in our hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by questioning some of the basic assumptions of the National Health Plan. Why is there an increasing demand on our health services? This is due to an increase in population, including a foreign worker population. It is also due to the fact that our population ages and is becoming more health-conscious, But, Sir, it is certainly not due to people who go to hospitals for the sake of going to hospitals. None of us want to go to hospitals. In fact, you are admitted to hospital only when the doctor refers you to one. Increase in demand for health services is therefore inherent in a society that progresses and continually strives to better the quality of life of its citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's concern over the increasing demand for our health services is reflected in paragraph 2 of the National Health Plan which informs us of a four-fold increase in the Ministry's budget between FY 71 and FY 81. But have these figures been adjusted for inflation? In other words, what is the actual increase in real expenditure between FY 71 and FY 81? At the same time, Sir, we must not forget that Government revenue has also gone up too. I think the Member for Rochore has expressed this quite eloquently. To put it in another way, Sir, is not this increase in demand on our health services and the increase in expenditure a consequence and a reflection of our economic growth, of inflation and of our population increase? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other objective of the National Health Plan which I would like to raise some thought is its aim of building up individual financial resources through the Medisave Scheme to pay for health care when one falls sick. Medisave will therefore encourage Singaporeans to stay well and reward those who do so as their money will remain in the CPF account and earn interest. Sir, I must again question the assumption here. The Medisave Scheme assumes that each of us has the ability to avoid illnesses. Those who fail to do so will be penalized. Those who have the remarkable talent for doing so shall be well rewarded. What is even more discomforting to me is that the Government aims \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to reduce demand for health services by using the stick approach. What it amounts to is that Government now intends to transfer the responsibility of payment for such uses from the Government to the users at the point of use. If therefore increasing demand for health services is inevitable, if certain illnesses are unavoidable no matter how fit one wants to be, and if the individual is going to bear the greater brunt of the financial cost of his health care, is it not wrong to assume that the National Health Plan has been motivated by purely financial considerations, and that its more covert purpose is to lighten Government's burden of escalating health care? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at the National Health Plan itself and the emphasis on financial considerations, I have the nasty feeling that the Ministry of Finance had quite a hand in it. What has happened to the Government's social responsibility? I believe, Sir, that somewhere along the line we have to strike the proper balance between what is the Government's social responsibility in so far as health care is concerned and the cost of providing it. My argument that the financial considerations have been foremost is reinforced by paragraph 27 of the National Health Plan which states that there will be more Class A beds at the expense of Class C beds in future. We all know that Class A beds are not subsidized by Government. So the Ministry will take away some Class C beds, convert them to Class A beds, sell them at higher prices and therefore increase Government revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is worrying me, Sir, is the statement in the Plan that in future admission to Class C beds will be restricted by the means test. One can already begin to question the reliability of such a means test. It might have the undesirable effect of deterring many people from seeking essential hospitalization if they find that they have been deprived of low-cost hospitalization by this so-called means test. Furthermore, hospitalization charges will not be the only consideration of the individual when he falls ill. He has to think in terms of his loss of earnings when he is hospitalized, not only his earnings but of those members of his family who have to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> take time off to see him. He has to think of his travelling expenses to and from hospital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was a bit relieved just now to note from the Minister that the quantum of subsidy on Class C beds will not be reduced. But I would urge him to seriously consider that the option of lowest possible cost of hospitalization must be left open to the individual and the individual must not be left with a feeling that he has been deprived of this option by a set of cold statistics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point on the National Health Plan which I like to touch on is the concept of community hospitals. The Member for Ayer Rajah has already stated his views. He questions the viability of this concept and I quite agree with him. However, my reasons may be a bit different because I feel that, aside from the question of economies of scale, Singapore is too small to have too many community hospitals. After all, many of our people would surely prefer to go to the general hospitals which are just as close to them as the community hospitals will be. And I do not really think that we can get our private practitioners to run our Government clinics at night or to run the community hospitals, although the Member's reason and mine differ. I think our private practitioners make enough money and they do not have to be encouraged to moonlight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to turn to the Medisave Scheme. I tend to disagree with the Member for Ayer Rajah when he said that the Medisave Scheme was not the heart and soul of the National Health Plan. In fact, when I discussed the National Health Plan with my friends, the typical response from them was typically Singaporean. How much do I have to pay and what do I get in return? The Minister is correct in saying that we must provide this umbrella for a rainy day. But my question here is whether this umbrella is large enough to shield us from all the rain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, Sir, the Medisave Scheme allows you to pay for C class care in a Government hospital or its equivalent in a private hospital only if it is for acute hospitalization, and that is all you get from Medisave. It does not allow you to pay for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> higher class care even if you can afford it. You cannot use it to pay for outpatient services. You cannot use it to cover hospitalization due to chronic or catastrophic illnesses. Sir, in dollars and cents, Medisave therefore really allows one benefit as opposed to a host of things that you cannot do with it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the consequences of this. Paragraph 44 of the National Health Plan tells us that in the last ten years 35% of our population were never hospitalized at all. So of the 65% who can be assumed to be hospitalized at least once in their lifetime, there will still be those who cannot use their Medisave account because the scheme would not cover certain types of illnesses. So quite a large portion of our population will, in fact, not be able to touch their Medisave account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, paragraph 55 of the National Health Plan states that a major portion of a person's lifetime hospitalization expenses is likely to be incurred after the age of 55. Sir, I quite agree that it is at this age onwards that chronic and catastrophic illnesses start to creep in and prolonged hospitalization becomes necessary. But what happens, Sir? You discover that having set aside a sum of money every month to provide for such contingencies, you find that you cannot use it when the time comes because your illness happens to fall outside the scope of the scheme. Well, there is some consolation. According to the Plan, you should not worry too much because, should you die, Medisave will pay the money to your Estate, free of duty. But this is my main criticism of the scheme, because it fails to realize that certain illnesses do occur through no fault of the individual no matter how much effort you put in to stay fit and to prevent illnesses. Sir, nobody knows when his kidneys or his heart will fail him. Nobody knows when cancer will strike. Medical treatment for chronic diseases is in many instances, in fact, in almost all instances, life-long and can be a heavy burden on the individual and his family. Medisave is therefore inadequate in meeting such needs. The consequences, Sir, can be far-reaching. If individuals cannot use their Medisave account to cover either wholly or partially such expenses, they may delay \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> seeking hospitalization till their health deteriorates or, worse still, they might resort to self-medication. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, people may find Medisave a wholly unattractive proposition because there might not be the incentive to put money into the Medisave account if they find that their savings cannot be used when it really matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument will no doubt be put forward that the 6% contribution will be inadequate to cover chronic illnesses. But let me say that something is better than nothing, at times like this. Sir, I realize that the National Health Plan and the Medisave Scheme cannot answer the needs of each and every individual. It is a unique plan. It is a bold plan and it will have far-reaching consequences. It is by far one of the most discussed issues in recent times and it would not be possible for the Minister and his officials in the Health Ministry to come out with a plan encompassing all the different and differing views that have been expressed. But as this is a matter of such importance and urgency, I would suggest to the Minister that not only should he review the National Health Plan periodically but to make it a point to come back to Parliament and report to Parliament on the shortcomings of the Plan so that we can together discuss, analyse and make recommendations. \n  <br>6.20 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard the Member for Rochore, I do not consider myself unlucky for not being the first speaker. I suppose I have to declare my interest in that I am a private practitioner with special interest in occupational safety and health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble of the Motion has these words, \"having noted the National Health Plan - A Blue Paper by the Ministry of Health etc\". Sir, I have some misgivings about this phrase because the debate is only confined to Part 11 of the National Health Plan ie, Medisave Scheme, and I am uncertain whether Part 1, ie \"Health Development Strategies\" will ever be debated in a future sitting of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first make a brief point on Part I of the National Health Plan before embarking on Part 11 - Medisave Scheme. The Second Minister for Health may recall that on 24th March, 1982, in the Committee of Supply Debate on his Ministry (Hansard, cols. 1595 and 1596) he gave this House an undertaking that his Ministry would take up my timely suggestion, \"to make mention of the comprehensive ... preventive occupational health programme in the National Health Plan\". This was in response to my suggestion at that time that when the National Health Plan details were announced in the future, I would like to see a substantial portion of its contents devoted to a developmental strategy for preventive medicine and not a skimpy and hackneyed statement of intention that the Ministry would emphasize on preventive medicine but lacking direction and substance for implementation. Hence, it was with a keen eagerness when I first received a copy of the Blue Paper to see whether my suggestion had been included. But to my utter disappointment, only a few brief lines in paragraphs 7 and 41 were all one could find mentioning preventive medicine and nothing at all on the health care of the working population. Let me re-emphasize what I said before, that the exclusion of the health care of so important a segment of our population, namely, the industrial population, from the pages of Part I of the National Health Plan appropriately entitled: \"Health Development Strategies\" would so reduce the scope of the coverage as to render it not comprehensive enough to qualify it as \"national\". If only a few paragraphs were included in the Blue Paper, this will not only enhance the standing of the National Health Plan but more importantly, it will guide the direction and development of proper preventive rather than solely curative health care programmes at the local factory level in the years ahead. My plea at this late stage is for some mention on \"Health Care of the Working Population\" to be included in Part I of the National Health Plan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Concept of Medisave</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the substantive Motion on the Medisave Scheme as outlined in Part 11 of the Blue Paper, I wish to support in principle the introduction of the Scheme \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for it is a uniquely Singapore generated scheme, entirely different from the various prepaid health care systems financed either by tax revenue as in the UK and USSR or supported by compulsory insurance of the European social democracies or the free enterprise systems, as in the USA. In all these countries, a political decision has been made to do away with financial restraints on individual demands, whereas the Medisave Scheme shifts the payment of service from a pooled resource to the point of consumption, ie on to the individual. There is an encouragement for individuals to stay healthy and prevents him from unnecessary abuse of public medical services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Chronic Illnesses Programmes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on looking at the Medisave Scheme as a whole, let me now focus attention on one deficient area which has caused widespread concern, namely, the area of chronic illnesses (paras. 52 and 53). It is plainly stated in para. 52 that Medisave does not cover chronic illnesses such as, I quote, \"the mentally ill or those who need dialysis for their kidney failure.\" And the reason proffered for this exclusion is the inadequacy of the 6% contribution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparent implication from this statement is that the sufferers of such chronic illnesses who by and large require prolonged hospitalization and often expensive forms of medical procedures (e.g. dialysis for kidney failure), will have to bear the enormous expenses themselves. This certainly places upon them an unbearable financial burden, particularly if they belong to the average wage earner class. Many have contracted such chronic illnesses through no fault of their own and in most cases, there is little dispute about the necessity of their hospitalization or their use of expensive medical procedures. In other words, virtually no abuse would pertain to such cases. If this were so, then they surely deserve assistance and it is strongly recommended that cases of chronic illnesses should be excluded from any financial restraint placed on them but be assisted by the community through Government sponsored programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if my interpretation of it is correct, this is how I understand paragraph 53 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to mean. I stand to be corrected by the Second Minister for Health on this. Let me now try to interpret paragraph 53. First, it states that \"chronic illnesses affect a small minority\" and \"such patients are best taken care of by other programmes outside of MEDISAVE\". I am in entire agreement with this on the principle that the Medisave Scheme places financial restraint on the patient and, in any case, the amount saved would be inadequate. It would be better if such cases were outside the Scheme but taken care of by other programmes which would not lay the burden of hospitalization and medical fees on them. I seem to read some support for this line of thinking in the solitary example of the \"other programmes outside the Medisave\" cited as in the case of the mentally ill. As one instance of such other programmes, paragraph 53 states that the mentally ill are heavily subsidized by the Ministry when they receive treatment at the Government hospitals and clinics. They only pay a nominal fee. It may therefore not be incorrect to infer from the example quoted that since this programme for the mentally ill is heavily subsidized by the Ministry, other programmes for other chronic illnesses would also as a matter of principle, be equally so subsidized by the Ministry when the Medisave Scheme is introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to see promulgated is a broad policy direction, where the public could be clearly assured that in cases of those suffering from chronic illnesses and catastrophic illnesses requiring prolonged hospitalization and expensive medical procedures, they would be covered by other programmes which are largely Government subsidized and sponsored, so that they would be duly cared for and be relieved from financial anxieties. I am glad that the Minister in his earlier address has given us a categorical assurance on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can foresee practical difficulties arising from this policy, such as the definition of \"chronic illnesses\". May I suggest that the Ministry with its panoply of experts could easily draw up a schedule of \"chronic illnesses\" along similar lines as the Schedule of Compensable Diseases under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Any person who is so diagnosed as suffering from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one of the illnesses listed in the schedule of chronic illnesses would then qualify to be taken care of by the Ministry's subsidized and sponsored \"other programmes\". In cases of dispute, the Ministry could set up Medical Panels, again along the lines of Medical Panels provided under the Workmen's Compensation Act to decide on such issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that, despite what has been said earlier in this House, I fully support the Medisave Scheme in its broad principles and with some modifications as I have elaborated earlier. As it is a uniquely Singaporean scheme, its success or failure will depend on its implementation. My plea is that we should give it a try. And if we are to be what we have been so far, then with the will and determination to succeed, and coupled with humanity and fairness in its implementation, the passage of time will be the better judge of its outcome, say, ten years from now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion. Thank you. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is now 6.30 p.m. Resumption of debate, what day, Mr Goh? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Tomorrow, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCREASE IN RENTS FOR HOUSING AND</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEVELOPMENT BOARD SHOPHOUSES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>6.30 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have claimed this right to speak on the Motion for the adjournment on the matter of the latest increase in the rents for shophouses let out by the HDB. If I may crave your attention on behalf of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> these shopkeepers for a while, Mr Speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anything else has created so much anger and frustration among a section of the community as the announcement of the increase announced in the press on the 4th May, 1983. I have been around my own constituency, particularly in the blocks where the tenants of the shops occupied their shops in 1957. It is now nearly 16 years since they have been in occupation. Their rents have gone up, or will go up, from somewhere in the region of $170 to $180, and in some cases from a region of $250 to $320, these rents which they are now paying will go up to $800, $850, $950. They are, understandably as I said, indignant on two grounds; that the increase should be effected at this time when the Government has been speaking of a recession and which is widely accepted; and secondly, that there has been no prior consultation with or reference to them before any attempt was made to increase the rents. I can understand these grievances and how they feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, having seen and read in the papers the protest that arose as a result of this announcement and particularly the report that several Members of this House were disturbed by the HDB's unilateral increase in the rents without any consultation with the shopkeepers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced in the press in June this year that I would gladly welcome any motion, any substantive motion, by any Member of this House, and that I would be very happy to second it if it were necessary and to speak in support of it. Alternatively, I asked whether any Member of this House would second a motion if I tabled one for debate in this House. Nothing came of this invitation from me. And then, Mr Speaker, Sir, as you may be aware, I gave notice pursuant to Standing Order 32 (1) of my intention to propose a motion at this sitting of the House, a substantive motion for debate: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this House regrets the proposed increase with effect from the 1st September, 1983 by the Housing and Development Board in the rents for shophouses let by the Board and calls upon the Board to suspend the implementation of the increases until a Committee of this House has examined the proposed \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> increases and reported thereon to this House and the House has by resolution accepted the increases.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving the notice, I took the trouble to speak to two Members of this House to ask whether they would second my motion because I needed a seconder. I regret to say that I found no takers of my invitation to the two Members that I spoke to. And may I say to those Members who have been protesting about this outside this House that it is a matter of regret to me that no one has been found to second my motion. I do not know how the 43 Members who are reported to have marched to the Minister for National Development's office will be able to face their own constituents if they are asked, \"Why didn't you second the motion from the Opposition Member?\" Well, that is their problem and I hope they will find an answer to explain their reluctance to second my motion. I suppose if any of them had done so, he might have found himself out of his seat in Parliament and I suppose that must have been or may have been the consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, may I move on to this matter on which I have asked to speak. When we were talking about the Medisave Debate, the first speaker congratulated the two Ministers of Health on the good public relations job they had done. It is a pity that the Ministry of National Development does not take a leaf out of the book of the Ministry of Health when it comes to implementing its decisions. There was a brief announcement of the reason when the increases were announced in the press on the 4th May, 1983. All it purported to say was that the increase was to remove an anomaly in its shop rents policy. So the question that arises is, what was the shop rents policy before the increases were announced? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not forget, Mr Speaker, Sir, that these shops, particularly those which were built 15, 20 years ago, were let at the market rents then prevailing and the tenants have been paying the let rent for the last 15, 17 years. What was the policy of the Board then? Why has it found it necessary now to revise its policy? One must not forget again, Mr Speaker, a number of things about this, and that is, these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shops in the HDB estates are performing a service to the residents in the estates. They are not all situated in busy shopping centres. Some of them are in isolated areas but they nevertheless serve a useful purpose by rendering a service to the residents in the estates. In my constituency, for example, even in Jalan Bukit Merah, these three blocks, the old blocks, do not front Jalan Bukit Merah. They are inside the estate and they do not attract anybody very much from outside the estate itself. Then one other thing that we must bear in mind is that quite a lot of them were resettled from the shops where they had been previously carrying on business. They might have owned them, I do not know, or they might have been tenants. And they gave up these shops in return for the HDB allocation of a shophouse. Now they are told suddenly, \"Either you pay these increases of three or four times or you get out.\" Some have asked, \"Will the HDB return the shops that they took from us?\" It may seem a bit naive but that is how some of them feel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the difference in the amenities between the old shophouses and the new shophouses because the announcement was that the rents would be brought up to the rents for shophouses let in January 1980. But there are obvious differences, only too apparent. One is a new building with new amenities, new facilities, improvements. The other is old. Why should the tenant of the old shophouse pay the same rent as the new one with new facilities, new improvements? In any case, Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the policy of the HDB as regards rentals charged to shopkeepers? Is it simply based on the price mechanism allowing the market price to control the rents? Or has the HDB any definite policy? Is it, for example, recoupment of capital outlay with a satisfactory return on the investment and perhaps coupled with building up a reserve for replacement cost? It is a pity that the HDB, and for this the Minister for National Development must take some responsibility, did not explain the rationale and the reason for these increases. Merely to say that there is an anomaly begs the question because there are obvious differences. There will be anomalies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for this matter to be raised in this House for one other reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, and that is, (I have said this before when I raised, again on the Adjournment, the increase in the prices of flats sold by the HDB) that a statutory board, like the HDB, for whose operations public funds are provided, not wholly but partly, such a statutory board should come to this House before it makes any increases in charges like rents or prices of HDB apartments. There is a tendency for Ministries and statutory boards to neglect the purpose and function of Parliament and that is, may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, a great loss if Parliament is not to be given its proper role and function in our society. There is the question of the purchase of the four planes from America. We would never have heard of this in this House officially if I had not raised a question today at Question Time. So I say to the Minister again, as I said to him when I raised the question of the increases in the prices of HDB flats, \"Will you please respect Parliament?\" I think we deserve in this House a statement from the Ministry or from the statutory board before it implements or announces a decision which will affect our population, our citizens, or a substantial proportion of them. As I said, I tabled a Motion but I had to withdraw it for lack of any support. And now, we are not able to have a debate on this increase. I would therefore ask the Minister to consider of his own volition whether he would suspend the implementation of the increases until a Committee of this House has examined the proposed increases and reported thereon to this House and the House has, by resolution, accepted the increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the report that he met Government Members of Parliament and explained it to them. I do not know what he explained to them but it would appear that he explained the increases and the rationale. But it is not just the Government MPs who ought to be explained the increases. This House has to be told and the public has to be told. And what better place than Parliament for the increases to be announced and debated upon. So I would ask the Minister to consider this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> request. May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think the shopkeepers will grudge any increase. They can see the reason for some increase and I certainly can see it. I am not saying that there should be no increase at all. But you got to make out a case for the increase. It is not to be carried out just because you think, \"Well, somebody else is getting so much more. Why don't we get a bit more for our rents?\" You cannot try and equate HDB shops in housing estates with shops in busy shopping centres and other areas. They deserve special consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not saying that there should not be any increase and I am sure the shopkeepers are not saying that either. But all they are asking is that there should be proper consideration given to their views, their representations, their problems. A number of them in my constituency - perhaps that is an exaggeration - about two, I think, said that they would have to probably close their businesses. And I see the Member for Khe Bong tabled a Question at Question Time to ask whether the Minister for the Environment would consider granting hawker licences to tenants who are compelled to give up their businesses. So it is causing quite a lot of distress and hardship to these tenants. What are they supposed to do? If they cannot get hawker licences, what are we going to do with them? Are they going to become a burden on the community? Are you going to tell them to troop up to the Ministry of Social Affairs and apply for public assistance? Is it not better that something is done to accommodate them so that they can continue to carry out a service to the residents and to the community and be useful members of the society and the community? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with those words, may I sit down and ask the Minister whether he would be good enough to defer this until further consideration has been given by a Committee of this House and this House has accepted the report of the Committee, and then implement the increases. \n  <br>6.50 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's policy, i.e. the HDB's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> function, is to provide decent homes for the people. Therefore, the prices, rentals, service and conservancy charges for HDB flats are kept low. Public housing is therefore heavily subsidized. This is the Government's policy. It is not the HDB's responsibility to subsidize businesses located in HDB estates. This again is the Government's policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses are run on a commercial basis and therefore the tenants of both HDB commercial and industrial premises are expected to pay market rentals. They cannot expect to pay subsidized rentals. The rentals of HDB shops are determined by public tender and HDB tenancies are designed to enable both the tenants and the HDB to terminate the tenancy agreements by giving one month's notice. In other words, the tenancy is a fair tenancy. Either party can terminate. A successful tenderer who subsequently finds that he cannot remain viable or that his rental is far above the market rate can give up his tenancy. In other words, the shopkeepers are not tied down by HDB tenancies which insist, \"You must rent HDB shops even if you have made a mistake in bidding for the shops at extremely high rentals.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Where else can they get a shop? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> He can get a shop at a lot of places. He can get a shop at an HDB estate. He can get a shop in a private development. In fact, if the tenant finds that he has over-tendered the premises, he can re-tender for the same premises in competition with other tenderers. And if his tender is realistic, he may be able to retain his shop at a lower rental. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give the Member an example. In 1975, in Marine Parade, Metro originally tendered at the rental of $39,300 per month for its supermarket in Marine Parade. Finding that this tender is too high, it subsequently gave up the premises and successfully re-tendered for it at $23,600 in 1978. In other words, the tenant who made a mistake can correct it by giving up his shop and tendering again. He is not tied down by the HDB that he has to continue to pay high rental for his shop. The Marine Parade Metro is still there. The hon. Member for Anson can go and have a look and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> find out whether the facts are correct or not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has a right under the tenancy agreement to increase rentals to the market rate. Until recently, HDB has not exercised this right, The HDB had considered increasing its shop rentals in 1974. The proposal was deferred because of the 1973 oil crisis and subsequently the world-wide recession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What about now? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> I will come to that. In the past, the disparity in rentals between the older and newer tenancies was not very glaring. In the last three years, however, the development cost of the shops and rentals shot up drastically. HDB has decided to adjust the rentals but only to the 1980 level and not to the 1983 level. The rentals proposed by the HDB at present are at the 1980 level. If the Member goes back to Anson to inquire from his shopkeepers, he will find that the shop rent at $800, as he has mentioned earlier, in fact, is still low. If the shopkeeper gives up his tenancy and we go for public tender, I am quite sure the shop will fetch more than $1,000, maybe $1,500. He can find out from his shopkeepers. It will prove that what I say is correct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the HDB fixing the rental at the 1980 level for the older shops is that HDB would like to soften the impact of the increase of the rental on these shopkeepers. Also, it is not the HDB's policy to lead the market in setting shop rentals. HDB's shop rental is still cheaper than that of the shops in Orchard Road. The hon. Member has mentioned that the HDB shops are not in the prime location. That is correct. Therefore, HDB shop rental is not as high as the shops in Orchard Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson's proposal to form a Committee of this House to examine the rental increases, I think, is totally unsound. When the increases were first announced in May 1983, 43 PAP Members of Parliament held a meeting with myself, my Minister of State, my Senior Parliamentary Secretary, and the staff of my Ministry, and the HDB. They were not invited by us. In fact, they came to see me. They got together and came to see me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> [Laughter] I will come to you later. The Members did not object to the principle of rental increases because they understood. And even the Member for Anson did not object, if I heard him correctly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> They made various constructive suggestions to minimize the possible hardship that increases would cause to some shopkeepers. After a thorough discussion and careful consideration, my Ministry adopted many of the MPs' suggestions with the approval of the Cabinet. The concessions worked out by the staff of my Ministry together with the MPs' suggestions were accepted by Cabinet. And those concessions have been very extensive and generous and, I am glad to say, have been accepted by all concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize that during this period I have not received a single suggestion from the hon. Member for Anson on how to resolve this problem. I have not received nor has my Senior Parliamentary Secretary received any suggestion from him either in writing or verbally. Am I right in saying that? So he has made no suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have written. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> The Member just now said that there is widespread unhappiness among shopkeepers and so on and so forth. I will give him the facts. By the 20th August, 99.1% of all the affected tenants have accepted the increase in rentals and signed the supplementary agreement - 99.1%. How many more per cent can you ask? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What choice do they have? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Some people have the choice. The remaining 0.9% comprising 66 tenants have decided to give up their tenancies. They have a choice. These 66 opted to give up their tenancies. It cannot even be said that all the 66 tenants who are giving up their premises are doing so purely because of the increase in rental. Because over the last five years, an average of 380 tenancies were terminated every year for various reasons. So, in fact, after the increase in rental, only 66 people are giving up their tenancies. And this year may prove to be the lowest number of HDB shop tenants to give up their tenancies. It may sound strange but it turned out to be so which, of course, I do not expect the hon. Member to understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry has on the 25th June 1983 written to me to express his gratitude towards the HDB for substantial concessions on the proposed rental increases, and the Chamber has commended the HDB for taking a flexible stand by considering the tenants' appeal compassionately. Eight traders' associations in HDB estates - they represent almost all the shops - have also on 11th July 1983 written to thank me. \n  <br>7.00 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It was reported in 1979. (For details of the case, please see Annex A, cols. 99 -100). Such crimes do not as yet pose a problem. However, with the widespread use of computers there may be more computer-related crimes in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer-related crimes can be divided into two broad categories. In the first category, the offender tampers with the input or output forms and peripheral equipment of a computer system for wrongful gain. Experience in the West has shown that most computer-related crimes fall under this category. Police officers do not need to have a thorough knowledge of computers to handle this category of computer-related crimes as they can be investigated just like any other case of cheating, CBT, forgery, theft, etc. However some basic knowledge of the computer would be useful to investigate such cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of computer-related crimes are those which involve tampering with the internal processes of the computer. Officers investigating this category of crimes need to have a thorough understanding of the computer system in order to gather the necessary evidence. Police officers investigating this category of computer-related crimes will require the assistance of competent computer professionals. Such competent professionals can be found in the Computer Systems Division of the Police Force, our National Computer Board and private companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1981, Police officers have been sent for seminars and courses conducted locally as well as overseas to equip them with sufficient knowledge to handle computer-related crimes. Six officers have attended various training courses in the investigation of computer-related crimes conducted at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, USA, the Australian Police College at Manly, Australia and the Mitchell's College, Australia. The Police Force will continue to step up its training programme for officers to ensure that they are well equipped to investigate computer crimes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to inform the Member of Parliament for Telok Blangah that a British Study Team was recently in Singapore to, among other things, make an overall study of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Commercial Crime Division. The Team's views and recommendations on computer-related crimes were as follows:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a In the investigation of computer-related crime, it is unrealistic to expect that the personnel of any law enforcement agency can keep abreast of every technical advance in a rapidly developing industry. With suitable training, they are, however, able to become relatively expert on basic computer technology and the more common forms of computer-related crime. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b A close relationship should be maintained with the National Computer Board and arrangements made for it to provide technical assistance when required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c The Commercial Crime Division is to be re-structured with one team of investigators assigned the responsibility of dealing with all computer-related crimes. The Inspector in charge of the Team should be sent for computer-related courses overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of legislation pertaining to computer-related crimes, the Team advised that this is still the subject of considerable international debate, and no all embracing legislation has yet been adopted in UK and USA. There is no immediate need in Singapore for new legislation. However the Team recommended that Singapore should keep abreast of developments in the advanced countries, with the ultimate objective of producing a statute covering the criminal aspects of computer abuse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team also recommended that the Commercial Crime Division be restructured with the formation of operational teams, each to operate as a self-contained, cohesive unit to handle cases. The establishment of the Division is to be reviewed annually so as to cope with the increasing workload. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team's report is now under consideration by the Ministry. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Annex A\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PLANS TO COMBAT COMPUTER CRIME</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only case reported to the Commercial Crime Division took place sometime in 1979. A female bankteller from the DBS intentionally prevented the printing of 2 non-financial transactions by slipping a piece of paper into a printer through the gap of the transparent window in front of a journal roll. The transactions were for the transformation of entry information of 2 account holders into the computer via the teller's terminal. Subsequently, the teller withdrew cash on two separate occasions from the two accounts using passbooks which she had misappropriated. She was prosecuted for 2 counts of Forgery for the Purpose of Cheating under Section 468 of the Penal Code, Chapter 103 and was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment in respect of each charge, the sentences to run concurrently. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DIALYSIS TREATMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> asked the Minister for Health (1) the number of patients undergoing dialysis treatment at Government hospitals; (2) the number of patients on the waiting list for such treatment at (a) Government hospitals, and (b) private hospitals; and (3) if his Ministry has any plan to expand the facilities for dialysis treatment at Government hospitals and the estimated capital and recurrent cost for each unit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> There are 2 Government centres for renal dialysis treatment, one at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and the other at Alexandra Hospital (AH). In SGH, dialysis is done by a team of trained nurses. In AH, dialysis is carried out by the patients who are assisted by their relatives under the supervision of a trained nurse. The centre in AH is known as a Self-Dependency Dialysis Unit (SDDU). The SGH dialysis centre has 10 stations plus 4 training stations for SDDU, while the AH SDDU centre has 11 stations. The total number of patients presently undergoing dialysis treatment at the 2 Government centres is 89, 45 at SGH and 44 at AH. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every year, there are well over 100 new cases referred to the Department of Renal Medicine with end stage renal disease who require dialysis. Data over the last 7 years are shown below:- \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n            1976   -     180 patients\r\n\r\n            1977   -     142 patients\r\n\r\n            1978   -     107 patients\r\n\r\n            1979   -     122 patients\r\n\r\n            1980   -     107 patients\r\n\r\n            1981   -     150 patients\r\n\r\n            1982   -     165 patients\r\n\r\n</pre> On a national basis, the actual number of new cases is higher as some patients are treated by the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any one time, there are about 20 patients on the waiting list for dialysis treatment at Government centres. The Ministry does not have record of those treated or on the waiting list for dialysis treatment by private doctors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The estimated capital cost is about $500,000 for converting and renovating an existing building into a dialysis unit. The estimated recurrent cost is about $392,200 per 10-station SDDU per year for 40 patients, or over $9,800 per patient per year. Of the total recurrent cost of $392,200, approximately 90% or $352,000 are for expendables (dialysers, blood lines, chemicals). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is developing a second SDDU in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) at a cost of $559,100. This Unit is partly financed by donations. When completed next month (Sept 83), it will have 10 SDDU stations with space for expansion to 20 stations later on. There are also plans to expand the SDDU in AH to 20 stations in the near future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Treatment of chronic renal failure is a difficult area in medicine. It is a long lasting ailment, complicated by the fact that treatment is expensive while possible cure depends on the availability of donated kidneys. The Government is doing as much as possible within its limited resources for the unfortunate victims. However, members of the community and philanthropic foundations can play their part. The urgent need is for available kidneys for transplantation, failing which for more funds to meet the high establishment and operating costs of dialysis stations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) It must be recognised that haemodialysis is no substitute for kidney transplant to achieve a better prospect for cure. A successful kidney transplantation will not only ensure a better lease of life to the recipient but will also create a vacancy for those anxiously waiting their turn for dialysis. Therefore the public can help positively by supporting kidney donations. Similarly, voluntary and community organisations can supplement the efforts of Government by providing funds and facilities for haemodialysis. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>VACANT HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RENTAL FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

The table below (cols. 103-4) gives details of the vacant units by zone and period of vacancy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rental flat is not immediately allocated for occupation when it falls vacant. For the comfort and convenience of the tenants, the HDB undertakes general repairs and repainting \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of each vacated flat before offering it to resettlement cases or public applicants on the waiting list. It normally takes 2 weeks to complete repairs and repainting. The process of offering takes another 2 weeks, inclusive of the time needed for the Lettings Section to identify and match applicants against vacancy lists, obtain the necessary approvals and notify the successful applicant. The applicant is given 1 week to decide whether to accept the offer. If he rejects it, the flat is offered to the next applicant in line. This process goes on until the flat is finally accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, 2 to 3 offers are made before a flat is taken up. The average period between the termination and occupation of HDB rental flats is 2 to 3 months. Flats in less popular areas, however, require a longer time to be accepted and may be vacant for up to 6 months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inevitable time lapse between termination and occupation of rental flats may cause the uninformed to believe that the HDB deliberately withholds flats from applicants who have waited a long time for accommodation.

As surveys indicate that there is a demand for additional cooked food stalls, the Board has plans to convert the vacant stalls into 12 cooked food stalls by April 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved facilities should be adequate to cater for residents in the new Gillman Heights HUDC estate, which will be ready for occupation in early 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 607 middle-income families occupying the flats at Gillman Heights will improve the business in the Depot Road market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WATER SUPPLY TO HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BOARD FLATS IN TELOK BLANGAH</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he is aware that the water supply to the Housing and Development Board flats in Telok Blangah appears to be contaminated by brownish sediment in recent months and if he will ask the HDB and the Public Utilities Board together to investigate the matter with a view to remedying the situation; and when the solution can be expected to be implemented. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> The water supply to residents in the western part of Singapore, including Telok Blangah New Town, comes from the Kranji, Pandan and Western Catchment Reservoirs. This water has a slightly higher chloride content than water from other reservoirs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some water tanks and iron pipes installed within the flats in Telok Blangah New Town have rusted. As a result, households in this area may occasionally find some rust sediments in their water supply. However, the water is still within the World Health Organisation standards for drinking water. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise rust sediments in the water supply of Telok Blangah New Town, the HDB is lining water storage tanks with non-corrodible material and replacing unlined water supply pipes to the tanks. This programme is expected to be completed by the end of 1983. For flats receiving supply directly from the mains, the PUB is replacing all connecting pipes that are made of unlined iron. PUB's programme will be completed in March, 1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, water storage tanks and pipes are periodically cleaned and flushed to remove rusty deposits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PREMISES NO. 51 CRAIG ROAD</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

At that time, there were 5 tenants in the premises. The owner of the premises had obtained a court judgement in September 1980 requiring these five tenants to quit the premises. The judgement was made with the tenants' consent. This is a private matter between the owner and the tenants under due process of law. The owner executed the writ of possession in July 1983 and thereafter delivered vacant possession of the premises to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a property is acquired on vacant possession basis, the responsibility for removing and compensating tenants lies not with the Government but with the landlord. This is why awards for property acquired on vacant possession basis are very much higher than awards for encumbered property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not grant re-housing benefits to former tenants of property acquired on vacant possession basis for two reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that the supply of resettlement units is limited. If the Government were to provide re-housing priority to such former tenants, there will be delay in the relocation of resettlement cases which genuinely qualify for re-housing. The waiting period for public applicants on HDB's waiting list will also be lengthened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that landlords affected by acquisition will be able to persuade their tenants to come to arrangements which lead to judgements for possession with consent being made by the court. Then the burden of relocating tenants will pass to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government while landlords reap enhanced acquisition awards on vacant possession basis, after their tenants have reached private arrangements with the landlords. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 51 Craig Road was acquired on vacant possession basis because the landlord was able to deliver vacant possession after a judgement by consent. Therefore, the previous tenants do not qualify for alternative HDB accommodation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXPENDITURE ON PROMOTION OF COURTESY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture for the total expenditure incurred by his Ministry and other Ministries for the promotion of courtesy in July and whether in his Ministry's view the money was well spent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> My Ministry has been allocated the sum of $357,500 for FY 83/84 for the courtesy campaign. Up to now we have spent $196,400. The amount incurred by other ministries is insignificant as they obtain supporting materials from the Ministry of Culture. The bulk of the expenditure was for printing materials as well as publicity over TV and Radio. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in an increasingly crowded nation. More than 70% of our people live in dense high-rise housing. In such a situation, courtesy is more than a smile and saying 'please' and 'thank you'. Knowing our neighbours in HDB flats and having consideration for one another in the way we conduct ourselves within our home and in public places, consideration for others on the roads and so on, are essential to lessen the frictions that are inevitable when people live in crowded conditions. The courtesy campaign is therefore necessary and the annual expenditure worthwhile. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Government has led the campaign, the private sector has responded enthusiastically. Many companies and organisations have participated actively promoting courtesy before, during and beyond the campaign month each year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to four surveys - two sponsored by Nanyang Siang Pau and two by Times Organisation - Singaporeans are now more courteous than they were in 1979 when the first campaign was launched. For example, Government departments have been reported to have improved a great deal. The staff are more courteous and many departments have streamlined their work procedures to remove irritation to members of the public. As another example, respondents to the survey indicated marked improvement in the courtesy shown by bus crews and taxi drivers. We shall continue to monitor the effects of the campaign. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Not reached by 3.30 p.m.)</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL CURRENT AFFAIRS QUIZ 1983</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Non-telecast by SBC)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr P.

To date, there are 15 water reservoirs, 3 river sources, 8 treatment plants and more than 3,480 kilometres of water transmission and distribution pipelines in the water supply system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1980-1982 alone, 4 new impounding reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 31.4 million cubic metres and related works were completed at a total cost of $66.9 million. These are Sarimbun, Murai, Poyan and Tengeh reservoirs. The storage capacities at the existing Seletar and Upper Peirce reservoirs were also increased by 6 million cubic metres at a cost of $2.3 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the same period, 303 kilometres of water mains were laid to improve the transmission and distribution network. New service reservoirs with a combined capacity of 306,000 cubic metres were also constructed at Kent Ridge, Nanyang and Bukit Kallang to regulate supply to Lim Chu Kang/Jurong, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun and the North Eastern part of the island. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) \n  <i>Further Improvements</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with the increasing demand for water, PUB plans to spend some $666 million over the next 5 years on water development projects. These projects will enlarge the reservoir storage capacity and extend and improve the transmission and distribution network. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the projects in hand are the Sungei Seletar/Bedok Water Scheme, which will be completed in 1984 and the service reservoirs at Bukit Kallang, Jalan Petua and Jalan Mariam, which will be completed by 1986. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) \n  <i>Supply Status</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is adequate supply to meet present demand and, provided that there is no severe drought or major disruption to any of our current water development projects, PUB expects to be able to meet future water demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) \n  <i>Avoiding Water Shortage in a Prolonged Drought</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is no ground for us to be complacent in regard to water supply. Because we have limited land to set aside for water catchment, water is a very precious commodity in Singapore. We can ride over short periods of dry weather or temporary interruptions to supply through the construction of more reservoirs. This we have done. However, in a prolonged dry spell, water stocks in reservoirs will evaporate rapidly and, in the final resort, there is no choice but to enforce water rationing. Knowing the inconvenience this will cause to our population and to industry, PUB will try to avoid water rationing for as long as possible. Consumers can help by reducing their water usage to enable the stocks in the reservoirs to last until the rain comes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid water shortage, consumers should learn to conserve water even during normal times. PUB has been encouraging and will continue to help consumers to practise water conservation until it becomes second nature with everyone in the Republic. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. \n  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, in view of the widespread use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the possible dangers associated with its use, what steps are being taken to protect the public to curb improper decanting by unscrupulous traders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> I am grateful to the Member for Thomson for raising this question. I can assure him that my Ministry is as concerned as he is about the possible dangers that can arise from the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). LPG is a highly inflammable fuel and approximately 60 per cent of households in Singapore use it for their domestic cooking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been reports of unscrupulous operators decanting LPG from large industrial cylinders into small cylinders using improvised equipment without paying attention to safety. The danger arises when the valves of the cylinders are tampered with during the improper decanting. Gas leakages arising from tampered valves can cause serious accidents endangering not only the operators but also innocent consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry takes a serious view of these dangerous practices. We have consulted the oil companies and relevant Government bodies on ways to eradicate improper decanting of LPG and protect the safety of the public. My Ministry has decided that it is in the public's interest that the LPG trade be regulated through licensing of all suppliers and dealers of LPG in Singapore. The licensing will compel suppliers and dealers to run a clean and honest operation and comply with certain safety standards including the use of security-valve sealing. The requirements for suppliers and dealers to be licensed are set out below. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will be enacting a set of Regulations governing the sale of LPG in Singapore under the Restrictions on the Supply, Distribution and Use of Petroleum and Electricity Act, 1973. Anyone who contravenes the Regulations will face a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment for a term of two years or both such fine and imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to bring the Sale of LPG Regulations into effect on 5 September 1983. To avoid disruption to the trade and inconvenience to consumers, existing suppliers and dealers of LPG will be given a three-month grace period from 5 September 1983 to apply for their licences. The Domestic Trade Section of my Ministry will administer and enforce the Regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Conditions of a Licence)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A supplier will be required to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) maintain an orderly and honest dealership and eliminate sub-dealers.
