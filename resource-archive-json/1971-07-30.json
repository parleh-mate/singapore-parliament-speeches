There is, however, an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the gross emoluments drawn  by  these\r\n\r\nofficers  because of the larger amount of donation\r\n\r\nmade  by the Board to the Provident Fund. For  the\r\n\r\n30-month period from 1st January, 1969, the  total\r\n\r\nincrease in the Board's donation to Provident Fund\r\n\r\nwould   amount  lo  51,350,700,  averaging   about\r\n\r\n$40,000 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 79 out of 839 officers who ate members of\r\n\r\nthe  Municipal Provident Fund have to pay  arrears\r\n\r\nin  excess of their monthly-consolidated  salaries\r\n\r\nto the Fund covering the 30-month period.

Let me tell  the\r\n\r\nMember  here  that if I had my way, it  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  been  backdated to 1st January 1969.  It  is\r\n\r\njust  because the Board made an error in promising\r\n\r\nthe staff that consolidation would be backdated to\r\n\r\n1st  January  1969. The question of backdating  is\r\n\r\none on which I hold very strong views indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> There should have been no\r\n\r\nbackdating, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an option was\r\n\r\ngiven   to   the   officers  whether   to   accept\r\n\r\nconsolidation  or  not.  Whether  it   should   be\r\n\r\nbackdated  to  1st  January,  1969,  or   not   is\r\n\r\nsomething which was forced on me.

Statistics  show  that  279  accidents\r\n\r\noccurred in the industry in 1969, and in 1970 this\r\n\r\nfigure rose to 376, a rise of nearly 35 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first six months of 1971, reports of 166\r\n\r\naccidents  have been received. What is  even  more\r\n\r\ntragic is the number of persons killed as a result\r\n\r\nof  these  accidents.  In 1969,  17  persons  were\r\n\r\nreported  killed  in the building and  engineering\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry. In 1970 it was  19.  Until\r\n\r\nJune  this  year, nine fatal accidents  have  been\r\n\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above figures illustrate the urgent need for\r\n\r\nthe   adoption  of  higher  standards  of   safety\r\n\r\nmeasures   in   the   building   and   engineering\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry. But experience  has  shown\r\n\r\nthat mere exhortations and appeals to the goodwill\r\n\r\nof the employers and the good sense of the workers\r\n\r\nto  be  more safety conscious have been of  little\r\n\r\navail.  My Ministry is therefore of the view  that\r\n\r\ndefinite guidelines are necessary. The Regulations\r\n\r\nnow  before  the  House not  only  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Factories Act relating  to  the\r\n\r\nhealth,  safety  and welfare of the  workers,  but\r\n\r\nalso   provide  for  safety  measures  of  special\r\n\r\napplication   to  the  building  and   engineering\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  The  cardinal   principle\r\n\r\nenunciated  in  these  Regulations  is  that   the\r\n\r\nrequired  safety  measures  for  any  project   or\r\n\r\nconstruction  work  should be  incorporated  right\r\n\r\nfrom the design stage and not left to be added  on\r\n\r\nas an afterthought or when accidents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  already  occurred. The basic provisions  for\r\n\r\nsafety  should therefore be `i major consideration\r\n\r\nat   all   stages  and  levels  of  planning   and\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations also stress the need for\r\n\r\nqualified and competent persons to erect or set up\r\n\r\nthe requisite safety measures and to make frequent\r\n\r\ninspections  to  ensure that  these  are  properly\r\n\r\nmaintained and correctly used. The Regulations not\r\n\r\nonly  require the employer to provide safe working\r\n\r\nconditions  but  also make it the  duty  of  every\r\n\r\nemployee  to  co-operate  in  carrying   out   the\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that with the implementation of\r\n\r\nthese  comprehensive,  unequivocal  and  stringent\r\n\r\nRegulations,   workers   in   the   building   and\r\n\r\nconstruction industry will enjoy a greater measure\r\n\r\nof safety at their working places and also enjoy a\r\n\r\nhigher standard of health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  all  very well to have all the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations, but how about their  enforcement?

In Singapore,\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and construction work are  going\r\n\r\non\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrapidly.  The  consequence of a disregard  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety  rules to achieve a target is the cause  of\r\n\r\nthe  rising  number  of  industrial  accidents  in\r\n\r\nrecent   times.   This  is   recognised   in   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  speech.  I am particularly  happy  to\r\n\r\nmake  an  observation of the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nBuilding   Operations  and  Works  of  Engineering\r\n\r\nConstruction  Regulations  which  would   provide,\r\n\r\namong  other  things, comprehensive  measures  and\r\n\r\nrequirements designed to safeguard the health  and\r\n\r\nsafety  of workers at the building and engineering\r\n\r\nconstruction  work  sites. These  Regulations  are\r\n\r\nmost necessary and timely. As is recognised by the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  number  of  accidents  in   this\r\n\r\nparticular field has been the highest. It  can  be\r\n\r\nexpected that in the race against time to complete\r\n\r\nbuilding projects, the accident rate in this  area\r\n\r\nwill increase. For instance, the competition among\r\n\r\nhoteliers  to  be the first to catch the  tourists\r\n\r\nhas  caused  the people concerned in the  building\r\n\r\nproject   to  disregard  all  safety   rules   and\r\n\r\nprecautions  necessary  for  the  safety  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, for example, an instance at the\r\n\r\nMandarin  Hotel construction site  where  two  men\r\n\r\nfell  to their death within a short space of time.\r\n\r\nAfter the first death, the workers asked for  some\r\n\r\nsafety measures to be taken. Their request fell on\r\n\r\ndeaf  ears.  After  the second fall,  the  workers\r\n\r\nstopped  work.  No one could blame  them  for  the\r\n\r\nstoppage.  In  fact,  with so much  disregard  for\r\n\r\nsafety  by the contractors. I think we could  well\r\n\r\nhave  some more stoppages. We could not blame  the\r\n\r\nworkers  for  their militancy in this respect.  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, when a trench wall collapsed at  the\r\n\r\nconstruction site of Chartered Industries I  think\r\n\r\nthis is a company owned by the Government a worker\r\n\r\nwas buried and killed by an avalanche. The workers\r\n\r\ndowned tools, they said, as a mark of respect  for\r\n\r\ntheir dead colleague. I think it is not only  good\r\n\r\nwages  and  bonuses  that the  workers  should  be\r\n\r\nconcerned with, but also their safety and  health.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  safety  and health standards  must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained at the highest possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel,  and  the introduction of these Regulations\r\n\r\nis  most  welcome  to  the National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  though the workers in the  building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  field  are not  organised.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  think the Chief Inspector of Factories\r\n\r\nshould pay some particular attention to reduce the\r\n\r\nsafety hazards, which the workers face day by day.\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial whether they are citizens or non-citizens.  There  are  some  10.000  citizens,   I\r\n\r\nbelieve, who are engaged in construction work. For\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  reasons,  I  think  more   attention\r\n\r\nshould be paid to reduce the safety hazards, which\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the engineering construction field\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make another point. Attempts\r\n\r\nshould  be  made to correct attitudes towards  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of safety. We can find one thousand  and\r\n\r\none  excuses to ignore safety hazards.  Among  the\r\n\r\nexcuses there is one quite commonly given  when  a\r\n\r\nrational  answer  cannot be  found  to  a  problem\r\n\r\nwhether  it is in respect of culture or  safety  -\r\n\r\nthat it is our Asian way of life. I think we could\r\n\r\nwell profit by adopting some Western habits. There\r\n\r\nwas  one incident, which comes to my mind. When  I\r\n\r\nwas  in Canada in 1963, as a V.I.P., I was brought\r\n\r\nto  a  construction site because  the  union  boss\r\n\r\nthere wanted to show me the pride of his town.  My\r\n\r\nhost  took  me  to  inspect the showpiece  of  his\r\n\r\nunion. Hardly had we been in the building for five\r\n\r\nminutes  when  I heard a loud voice shouting  like\r\n\r\n\"Get  out\" several times. My host, the union  boss\r\n\r\ntried  to  explain  to  the foreman,  \"We  have  a\r\n\r\nV.I.P.\". That explanation was totally disregarded.\r\n\r\nHe was shouted down and practically abused. We got\r\n\r\nout of the building. After he had cooled down, the\r\n\r\nforeman  heard  the union boss' explanation.  Very\r\n\r\npolitely,  he brought us in after he  had  ordered\r\n\r\nsome  helmets for us. This is the kind of attitude\r\n\r\nwhich  foremen or mandores engaged by  contractors\r\n\r\nin  our own building and construction site; should\r\n\r\nhave. Unfortunately, they have not.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say is that the N.T.U.C, welcome these\r\n\r\nRegulations. We have made a study of  them  and  I\r\n\r\nthink we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  have a period of experimentation,  and,  if\r\n\r\nneed be, make the necessary amendments as a result\r\n\r\nof experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in entire\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the sentiments expressed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kallang.

The quality of life for  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, like our Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats which house one in three of our people,  has\r\n\r\nno  alternative but to go up. For it not to go  up\r\n\r\nis   to   expose   our  people  to   poverty   and\r\n\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are rapidly becoming a nation. Our\r\n\r\npeople  today  are able to cohere and  to  respond\r\n\r\ncollectively  to challenges to the Republic.  They\r\n\r\nhave  a  stake here. Some 700,000 of our  citizens\r\n\r\nlive in 125,000 H.D.B, flats. Another 500,000 will\r\n\r\nlive  in the 100,000 flats to be built in the next\r\n\r\nfive  years, some of which will be located in  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan.   These  flats  are  subsidised   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Thus the less affluent of  our  people\r\n\r\nare  directly benefiting from the wealth  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  generated in Singapore. The more well-to-do\r\n\r\nhave  homes  in the many fine housing estates  and\r\n\r\nblocks of luxury flats that abound in our island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt whatsoever that our people will\r\n\r\ndefend what they have created and what they own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also confident that I speak for all Members\r\n\r\nin  this House that we will not be deflected  from\r\n\r\nour   course   towards   a  modern,   multiracial,\r\n\r\ndemocratic and industrialized island-nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, the debate following the speech\r\n\r\nof  our late President Yusof Bin Ishak was sombre.\r\n\r\nWe  faced  many  problems then,  for  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment   had   decided  to  accelerate   their\r\n\r\nmilitary  withdrawal. The Member for Nee  Soon  on\r\n\r\nthat  occasion spoke about maintaining a  rate  of\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  Gross Domestic Product  of  eight  per\r\n\r\ncent.  There  must have been many  at  that  time,\r\n\r\nacademic  economists included  those adherents  of\r\n\r\nthat dismal science - who must have thought him an\r\n\r\nincorrigible optimist. But his confidence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  will and determination of our people  was\r\n\r\nwell founded. If today that Honourable Member were\r\n\r\nto  predict the same rate of growth of  eight  per\r\n\r\ncent for our economy, which I am sure he will not,\r\n\r\nhe  would  be  suspected  of  being  a  congenital\r\n\r\npessimist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the measure of our success in overcoming\r\n\r\nour economic problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all of our problems are solved by\r\n\r\na mere doubling of the rate of growth of the Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product. The Minister of Defence  sagely\r\n\r\nobserved  in a recent speech that economic  growth\r\n\r\nby  itself does not necessarily generate happiness\r\n\r\nall  round. I will only add the trite comment that\r\n\r\nthe absence of such growth can be relied upon most\r\n\r\nassuredly to generate the greatest unhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six years since our separation from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the average annual growth rate  of  our\r\n\r\nGross   Domestic  Product  was  12.8   per   cent.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  in  the six years before  separation,\r\n\r\nthe  average annual growth rate was 7.6 per  cent.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore  have  cause for  satisfaction.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are new problems which we had not  hitherto\r\n\r\nfaced as the various parts of the addendum to  the\r\n\r\nPresident's speech remind us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Science and Technology is taking\r\n\r\nsteps  to  establish an \"indigenous  technological\r\n\r\ncapability\",  and  the Ministry  of  Education  to\r\n\r\nexpand  the  supply  of  technical  skills.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures   to   overcome  the  present   temporary\r\n\r\nshortage of skilled labour are to be commended. In\r\n\r\nthis   respect,  though  Ulu  Pandan  is  not   an\r\n\r\nindustrial   constituency,  we   also   contribute\r\n\r\ntowards meeting the challenge of industrialization\r\n\r\nwith our Dunearn Secondary Technical School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully in support of the declared intention\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of Labour to punish \"recalcitrant\r\n\r\nemployers  wilfully  neglecting  the  safety   and\r\n\r\nhealth  of workers\", and to treble the quantum  of\r\n\r\nworkmen's  compensation.  We  have  earlier   this\r\n\r\nafternoon   heard  how  urgent  the   problem   of\r\n\r\nworkmen's safety is from the Minister of State for\r\n\r\nLabour. Workers have strong voices in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse, as we also recently heard. For example, the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Honourable Member for Kallang  have\r\n\r\nled   to  silicosis  being  regarded  now  as   an\r\n\r\noccupational disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with Government's view\r\n\r\nthat  employers who have been making  \"exceptional\r\n\r\nprofits\"   ought   to  give  better   bonuses   in\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the workers' contribution  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  economic prosperity. I also believe  that\r\n\r\nworkers  must  obtain an increasing share  in  the\r\n\r\nwealth  generated  as a result  of  their  greater\r\n\r\nefficiency  and productivity. This will  no  doubt\r\n\r\ncome after the effects of the British military run-down have been assessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really all workers, as some of my friends\r\n\r\nin  the University of Singapore have at long  last\r\n\r\nrecognized. They have organised a trade union.  It\r\n\r\nis  to be hoped that they will recognize, too, the\r\n\r\ncommon interests of all workers, whether they work\r\n\r\nstanding up or sitting down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President touched on a crucial problem\r\n\r\narising out of our rapid economic growth.  We  are\r\n\r\nmaking  the  transition  from  an  economy   based\r\n\r\nlargely  on  entrepot trade and  services  to  one\r\n\r\nbased  on manufacturing and services. We  run  the\r\n\r\nrisk  that  some of our businessmen have  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to distinguish between entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nand  managerial skills. It is one thing  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful merchant; it is quite another to be the\r\n\r\nsuccessful manager of a large corporation - be  it\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,   servicing,   transportation   and\r\n\r\ncommunications  or, for that matter,  finance  and\r\n\r\nbanking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very different thing to study or to\r\n\r\nteach political history or political science,  and\r\n\r\nto participate in the political process itself. So\r\n\r\nit is with the study and teaching of Economics and\r\n\r\nBusiness  Administration and the practice  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether we should not attempt to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  distance  between  our  two  Universities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on the one hand, and Raffles  Place  on\r\n\r\nthe   other.  The  Universities  can  provide  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical  conceptual framework and intellectual\r\n\r\ndiscipline. Raffles Place can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemonstrate how important are considerations of  P\r\n\r\nand   L,  namely,  Profit  and  Loss,  of  meeting\r\n\r\ndeadlines and can provide potential managers  with\r\n\r\non-the-job experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Science and Technology recently\r\n\r\ncalled   for  a  diminution  of  distrust  between\r\n\r\nacademics  and  bureaucrats.  I  support  him  and\r\n\r\nfurther   propose  greater  co-operation   between\r\n\r\nacademics and business executives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new breed of managers, professional in\r\n\r\ntheir  approach to the problems of a manufacturing\r\n\r\neconomy   and  international  in  their   outlook,\r\n\r\nbecause  our  industries are export-oriented.  Our\r\n\r\nbanks  ought to consolidate, to co-operate and  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  management skills so that we  can  become\r\n\r\ninternational bankers. It is a sad fact  that  our\r\n\r\n11 domestic banks have a total of only 11 branches\r\n\r\noverseas, excluding Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is one problem that interests several\r\n\r\nMinistries.   When  Stamford   Raffles   came   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  1819,  one of  its  attractions  in\r\n\r\naddition  to its strategic location and  excellent\r\n\r\nnatural  harbour was the abundance of  good  fresh\r\n\r\nwater.  However,  the increased  demand  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  the rapid expansion of homes for our  people\r\n\r\nand  the  development of industries has  caused  a\r\n\r\ntemporary shortage of supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have a seasonal surplus, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational  Development intervenes, Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse will be pleased to know that the Bukit Timah\r\n\r\nFlood Alleviation Scheme, which is located in  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan,  is nearing completion. When we  have  too\r\n\r\nlittle  of water, as in recent months, the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board  of the Prime  Minister's  Office\r\n\r\nbecomes involved, and we M.P.s go around exhorting\r\n\r\npeople to conserve its use. After effective  anti-pollution  measures, we can extract  one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe average daily rainfall of 750 million gallons.\r\n\r\nWe  will then be able to meet the demand for water\r\n\r\nfor  many  years to come. The Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nalso  has an interest in water, or rather in those\r\n\r\npeople     who,     through    inadvertence     or\r\n\r\ninconsideration, breed mosquitoes in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress that we have achieved is the hard\r\n\r\nwork  of  a political leadership, a civil service,\r\n\r\nmen  and  women  in the uniformed  services,  both\r\n\r\nlabour  and management in the private sector,  who\r\n\r\nby  and large lived through a period when Asia was\r\n\r\nconvulsed by revolutionary changes. These  changes\r\n\r\nsharpened their awareness of the forces of history\r\n\r\nthat were at play and they responded positively to\r\n\r\nthe challenges of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolutionary changes, such as military\r\n\r\noccupation by an external power, will not be\r\n\r\nallowed to happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that there are no longer\r\n\r\nchallenges  to grip the imagination of our  young,\r\n\r\nno  problems  for  them to grapple  with.  One  of\r\n\r\nMagellan's  ships  circumnavigated  the  globe  in\r\n\r\n1521. It was a singular feat by any standard.  But\r\n\r\nin  1969 Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, a feat\r\n\r\nthat  I  myself stayed up all night  to  watch  on\r\n\r\nLondon Television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our burgeoning industries and the expressed\r\n\r\nintention  of our Government to make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nfinancial centre open vast opportunities  for  the\r\n\r\ndiligent, the able and the enterprising. Also open\r\n\r\nare  careers  in  the uniformed services  and  the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the young who have not undergone the\r\n\r\nmetamorphosis   brought  about  by   revolutionary\r\n\r\nchanges  must consciously develop their  political\r\n\r\ninstincts in order to enjoy their inheritance  and\r\n\r\nto build upon it. If they should become complacent\r\n\r\nand negligent, they will run into difficulties  in\r\n\r\nthe years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs addendum has\r\n\r\nnoted  some of the major recent developments.  The\r\n\r\nIndian  Ocean  has  joined the  Pacific  Ocean  in\r\n\r\nattracting the interest of the big Powers.  We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are one main connexion between these two\r\n\r\noceans.  Like  the real estate in  Ulu  Pandan  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years,  the  value of Singapore  has  also\r\n\r\nrisen very considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are too small a country to be able to\r\n\r\ninfluence appreciably the attitudes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  policies of the big Powers. However, we  must\r\n\r\nbe   certain  that  we  understand  and  interpret\r\n\r\ncorrectly  their real intentions so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nplan for the best interests of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we need to establish closer\r\n\r\nties  with our Southeast Asian neighbours. We need\r\n\r\nto   learn  what  are  their  problems  and  their\r\n\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education in recent years\r\n\r\norganised  two  seminars, one on \"South-east  Asia\r\n\r\nToday\" and the other on \"Communism and Democracy\".\r\n\r\nThe seminars gave our Pre-University students some\r\n\r\ninsight  into these problems and the  thinking  of\r\n\r\nour  leaders on them. They also served to  provoke\r\n\r\ngreater  thought and discussion among the students\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my association with these seminars as well\r\n\r\nas meeting students in the University of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  schools,  I  am  greatly  encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\npositive and realistic approach of most of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge Government to send parties\r\n\r\nof  our students to visit our neighbours in South-east Asia, beginning possibly with the close ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries. We already offer scholarships for ASEAN\r\n\r\nstudents  to  come  to  Singapore,  but   we   can\r\n\r\nencourage larger numbers to come on visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that our young people would like to\r\n\r\nhave their views heard and some of their proposals\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Mere articulation of  ideas  may  be\r\n\r\ngood  for the ego, but ideas are of little benefit\r\n\r\nto  the people at large unless they are tested and\r\n\r\nput into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the great challenge of this decade is for\r\n\r\nus  to survive and progress as an independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation in the fluid situation  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing very rapidly created in South-east Asia.  We\r\n\r\nwill  need  the ingenuity of all our  people,  the\r\n\r\nyoung  and  the  not  so young,  to  steer  safely\r\n\r\nthrough the rough waters ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest to Government to send\r\n\r\nabroad    groups   of   our   community   leaders,\r\n\r\nparticularly members of the Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees   and   community   centre   management\r\n\r\ncommittees. They can see for themselves the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems and achievements of our neighbours. I am\r\n\r\nsure  there will be much that they can  learn  to\r\n\r\nput to good use for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on that note I wish to thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, and Members of the House  for  the\r\n\r\ncourtesy and patience you have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in the history of mankind,  there\r\n\r\nare  examples of small countries which were  very\r\n\r\nprosperous  and  strong;  for  instance   ancient\r\n\r\nPhoenicia  and medieval Venice are good examples.\r\n\r\nEven  in  recent times, we have examples of  some\r\n\r\nsmall countries surrounded by stronger countries,\r\n\r\nsuch as Finland, which is encircled by Russia and\r\n\r\nSweden;  Switzerland,  which  is  surrounded   by\r\n\r\nFrance,  Germany and Italy; and Israel, which  is\r\n\r\nsurrounded by the Arab countries. These countries\r\n\r\nare  all  independent and yet they  can  survive.\r\n\r\nMoreover,   they   have  also   developed   their\r\n\r\ncountries  and have not become the appendices  of\r\n\r\nstronger powers. The reason is that their society\r\n\r\nis  not  made  up  of loose and  pleasure-seeking\r\n\r\npeople. We can see from this that the success  or\r\n\r\nfailure of nation building depends mainly on  the\r\n\r\ntype  of people. Success comes if the people have\r\n\r\na  strong  will,  a united purpose  and  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness, and who will always think in terms\r\n\r\nof  the  interest of the whole country. They  are\r\n\r\nunited in the common purpose of forming a closely-knit society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 9th August. 1965, when Singapore was\r\n\r\nforced  to  be independent, we, a small  country,\r\n\r\nhave  managed  to survive and progress.  When  we\r\n\r\nbecame  independent,  our Government  immediately\r\n\r\nannounced  to  the  world  that  we  will  be  an\r\n\r\nindependent and neutral country, and that we will\r\n\r\nbe  friend  with all the other countries  of  the\r\n\r\nworld We want to make as many friends as possible\r\n\r\nand  as  fewer  enemies as  possible.  With  this\r\n\r\nforeign   policy  and  posture  we  entered   the\r\n\r\ninternational  arena.  Only  with  this  kind  of\r\n\r\npolicy  can we ensure our survival in this  fluid\r\n\r\nregion in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, which is the arena of Super-power\r\n\r\npolitics. We have no other alternatives. We  must\r\n\r\nbe  determined to live on. During these six years\r\n\r\nunder  the  judicious leadership and guidance  of\r\n\r\nour  Government, with their timely  judgment  and\r\n\r\nthe various measures taken for the benefit of the\r\n\r\npeople,   we  have  seen  prosperity  and   great\r\n\r\nprogress  in  our commerce and industry.  We  now\r\n\r\nhave  political stability, peace and social well-being.  Our people are contented with their  lot.\r\n\r\nBut we can only maintain our prosperity, economic\r\n\r\nprogress and growth provided we have the will  to\r\n\r\nsurvive,   the  determination  to  maintain   our\r\n\r\nindependence  and sovereignty, a united  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness, co-operation with one another, and\r\n\r\nif  we  redouble  our  efforts  towards  national\r\n\r\nregeneration.  In addition to  this,  if  we  are\r\n\r\nresolute, we will achieve much, not only  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  field  hut  also  in  the  spheres  of\r\n\r\ndefence, economy, culture, education, health, and\r\n\r\nsocial activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy speech made by the President on\r\n\r\nthe  21st  of  this month paints  a  very  bright\r\n\r\nfuture  and  shows  us a guiding  path  to  tread\r\n\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch upon the effect\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore's rapid growth  and  development\r\n\r\nhas  on  the people of Thomson Constituency.  Our\r\n\r\nland  is limited. Unless we can make full use  of\r\n\r\nit  many otherwise good plans may not be  of  any\r\n\r\nuse.  The Housing and Development Board  has  all\r\n\r\nalong   taken   the  correct  measures   in   the\r\n\r\nacquisition and use of land. It has received  the\r\n\r\nsupport  and praise of all our people. Under  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  plans  in  Thomson  Constituency,\r\n\r\nGovernment has acquired 42 acres of land  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity of Sin Ming Road. It intends to  develop\r\n\r\nthe  area  into  an industrial estate  for  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  and to build a motor vehicle inspection\r\n\r\ncentre.

Following    the    transportation\r\n\r\nimprovement planning and the development of  Upper\r\n\r\nThomson  Road  under  the road  expansion  scheme,\r\n\r\nabout  100  to  200 shop premises  there  will  be\r\n\r\naffected.

They are also satisfied  with  the  new\r\n\r\ntypes  of  shop premises to be allocated to  them.\r\n\r\nBut they have one common request to make, that is,\r\n\r\nthe   authorities   concerned  under   the   house\r\n\r\nownership  scheme should enable them to buy  their\r\n\r\nshop  premises  for  their own use  on  instalment\r\n\r\nterms,  and  not  to allocate the  premises  on  a\r\n\r\nrental basis. I would also request the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment     Board    to    give    sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration to the requests of these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question relating to the problem of\r\n\r\nhawkers, which requires a solution.

Sir., I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe  motion  in  the name of the  Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan to express our thanks to the President  for\r\n\r\nthe  speech  which he delivered on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment at the opening of the Second Session of\r\n\r\nParliament on 21st July, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two problems face all new countries regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  they  are in Asia,  Africa  or  South\r\n\r\nAmerica. The first is the problem of making  newly\r\n\r\nindependent countries economically viable, so that\r\n\r\nwith  a  rising Gross National Product the  people\r\n\r\ncan   enjoy   their  freedom  with  dignity.   All\r\n\r\nindications  are  that we will  continue  to  make\r\n\r\ngreater  economic progress. A member of  the  U.S.\r\n\r\nPresidential Commission on International Trade and\r\n\r\ninvestment Policy, who is also the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nFirst  National  City Bank of  Chicago,  recently,\r\n\r\nremarked   \"Singapore's  thriving   business   and\r\n\r\nindustry   have  become  a  model  for  developing\r\n\r\nnations around the world.\" He also predicted  that\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  Dollar market in Singapore  will  grow\r\n\r\nfivefold from U.S.$400 million to US$2 billion  in\r\n\r\nthe next two or three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is that of political and\r\n\r\nsocial  stability. Without this there will  be  no\r\n\r\npeace,  and without peace there can be no economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to dwell at length on the question of\r\n\r\npolitical  and  social stability in  our  country.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not  the only multi-racial,  multi-religious  aid multi-cultural society amongst  the\r\n\r\nnew countries in the world. We have inherited this\r\n\r\nplural  society from the British,  and  since  the\r\n\r\nPAP,  came  to power in 1959, we have persistently\r\n\r\ncarried  out  educational and  cultural  policies,\r\n\r\nwhich are aimed at uniting the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the differences of race, culture,\r\n\r\nlanguage  and religion, Singaporeans have  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge   accepted  the  realities  of  life.  Their\r\n\r\napproach   to   problems   arising   from    these\r\n\r\ndifferences  is  both tolerant and  pragmatic.  We\r\n\r\nhave  learned  to  live together  as  one  people,\r\n\r\ndespite  our  different racial origins,  cultures,\r\n\r\nreligions and languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, the P.A.P. Government has from time\r\n\r\nto   time  taken  firm  action  in  putting   down\r\n\r\ncommunalistic,  chauvinistic  or   any   kind   of\r\n\r\nextremist  agitation.  We  remember  vividly   the\r\n\r\nriotous  days of 1964 when religion and  race  was\r\n\r\nexploited.  This  brought death and  suffering  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  all  races.  In  May  1969,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in quick anticipation,  quelled  what\r\n\r\ncould    have    been    a   nasty    inter-racial\r\n\r\nconflagration. And in May this year the Government\r\n\r\ntook   drastic  action  against  journalists   and\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to  prevent what  could  have  led  to\r\n\r\nviolent riots similar to those of 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to remain a united people, we must\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the factors which bind us  together\r\n\r\nand not those, which will divide us. The events in\r\n\r\nMay  this  year showed that communalism  need  not\r\n\r\nraise its ugly head from among the Malay community\r\n\r\nonly.   Communalism  and  chauvinism  can  equally\r\n\r\nemerge  from the majority community in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  was  therefore  necessary  for  Government  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that majority chauvinism also  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  tolerated.  The  fact is that  all  groups  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, whether majority or  minority,  should\r\n\r\navoid  excesses  in  the  interplay  of  politics,\r\n\r\nwhether   they  are  agitated  on  the  basis   of\r\n\r\nreligion,  culture or language.  Sensitive  issues\r\n\r\nshould never be allowed to be exploited by anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of nation building must never be\r\n\r\nlost  sight  of.  This is all the more  imperative\r\n\r\nbecause,  although we have made great  strides  in\r\n\r\neconomic development, there is still much to do to\r\n\r\nfoster  a political community of Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nmust   first  be  Singaporeans  and  next  Malays.\r\n\r\nIndians,  Chinese  and  others.  Only  if  we  are\r\n\r\nassured of this can there be political and  social\r\n\r\nstability.  It  is true that, as Malays,  Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndians and Eurasians we differ in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraditional  values  and  culture,   but   it   is\r\n\r\nnevertheless  important  that  we  cultivate   the\r\n\r\ncommon  denominators  which make  us  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith  our  own political territory and  object  of\r\n\r\nloyalty.  Although Singapore is  situated  in  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Archipelago,  our ancestors  came  to  this\r\n\r\nisland as immigrants and have made it what  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday  -  a  bustling, energetic  and  progressive\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-lingualism in Singapore as practised in\r\n\r\nour  schools in the four languages is aimed, among\r\n\r\nother things, at giving cultural ballast and roots\r\n\r\nfor   our   multi-racial   Singaporeans.   Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese,  Indians and others must continue  to  be\r\n\r\nculturally  rooted  in  their  own  languages  and\r\n\r\nliterature. Young Singaporeans who emerge from our\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese,  Tamil and English  schools  will\r\n\r\nalso  know  their own mother tongue besides  being\r\n\r\nequipped with English, a language which will  give\r\n\r\nthem  the extra quality of being in close  contact\r\n\r\nwith the scientific and technological advances  in\r\n\r\nthe modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the speech by the President,\r\n\r\nthe   policy  of  giving  increased  and  improved\r\n\r\nlanguage   teaching  in  the  first   and   second\r\n\r\nlanguages  has  been spelt out very clearly.  More\r\n\r\ntime  will be allotted in the primary schools  for\r\n\r\nthe  teaching of languages. This will be  done  in\r\n\r\norder   that   students  will  become  effectively\r\n\r\narticulate  in the first and second  languages  to\r\n\r\nprepare  them  for  secondary education.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  the  training of teachers  will  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  adjusted to provide  more  effective\r\n\r\nteaching  of  bilingual students. It is  also  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   policy  to   expand   and   develop\r\n\r\ntechnical education and industrial training at the\r\n\r\nsecondary school level until our secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents  finish  their  Secondary  IV.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the emphasis from now on will  be  on  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of skills through apprenticeship schemes\r\n\r\nand joint training programmes with industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the British were in power ruling Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a colony, it was only those who completed  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  school  system  who  were  assured  of  a\r\n\r\nfuture. Now that we are independent, this  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger be so.

On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, we  should  take  a  positive   and\r\n\r\nrealistic  stand  in facing the  problem  of  job\r\n\r\nopportunities. Surely the most effective  way  to\r\n\r\nimprove   employment  opportunities  for   Malay,\r\n\r\nChinese and Tamil school-leavers is to equip them\r\n\r\nwith an effective working knowledge of English as\r\n\r\na  second language and a third language as  well.\r\n\r\nIt  is already a fact in Singapore that there are\r\n\r\nschool-leavers from the Malay, Chinese and  Tamil\r\n\r\nstream  schools who are as proficient in  English\r\n\r\nas those from the English stream. What we have to\r\n\r\ndo  now is to increase their numbers so that they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  at a disadvantage regarding  their\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school system in Singapore where English is\r\n\r\nthe  medium of instruction will fall short of its\r\n\r\nown  target. In actual practice, it is  not  that\r\n\r\nless economic value is placed on the Malay-medium\r\n\r\ncertificate, but that some employers  might  have\r\n\r\nfelt  that  the Malay-medium certificate  holders\r\n\r\nhave  not come up to the level of English  school\r\n\r\ncertificate  holders in their  comprehension  and\r\n\r\nexpression of the English language. This possibly\r\n\r\nalso  applies  to  certificate holders  from  the\r\n\r\nChinese and Tamil stream schools,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore obvious that the remedy lies in\r\n\r\ngiving  extra attention by all concerned  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  English in the  non-English  stream\r\n\r\nschools.  This  should include improved  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods  of  English as a second  language,  more\r\n\r\nEnglish  teaching periods per week,  more  Malay!\r\n\r\nEnglish,  Chinese  /  English  and  Tamil/English\r\n\r\nintegrated   schools,  and  perhaps   a   greater\r\n\r\nconsciousness all round by principals,  teachers,\r\n\r\nparents and pupils alike of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  to  write  and  speak better  English.  The\r\n\r\nobvious  solution  is  for  Singaporeans  to   be\r\n\r\neffectively bilingual or trilingual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing basically wrong with our multi-stream schools in the four official languages.\r\n\r\nBut  any attempt to turn our multi-stream schools\r\n\r\ninto  English  schools and label  them  \"National\r\n\r\nschools\"  would amount to self-deceit. Worse,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  defeatist attitude which is well expressed\r\n\r\nin  the  Malay  proverb which  says  that  it  is\r\n\r\npointless  to bum the mosquito net  when  one  is\r\n\r\nonly irritated by a mosquito.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration of the races in Singapore can best\r\n\r\ncome about when our children grow up imbibed with\r\n\r\na  sense  of  belonging, patriotism and  love  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean values. A psychological make-up which\r\n\r\ndevelops on the basis of common interests  and  a\r\n\r\ncommon  destiny is what will jell a multi-lingual\r\n\r\nand  multi-racial community into a united nation.\r\n\r\nThe  English  language might be a useful  vehicle\r\n\r\nfor progress in the process of modernisation, but\r\n\r\nit  cannot  give  us  the  cultural  strength  or\r\n\r\nidentity,  which  the Malay,  Chinese  and  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguages can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical politics in the multi-racial society\r\n\r\nin Singapore is such that if a school system with\r\n\r\nEnglish as the medium of instruction is forced on\r\n\r\nthe  people,  then the hands of  chauvinists  and\r\n\r\nracialists in the various linguistic groups  will\r\n\r\nbe  strengthened.  It will, in  fact,  amount  to\r\n\r\nhanding them the golden opportunity of exploiting\r\n\r\nracial   and  language  sentiments  amongst   the\r\n\r\nChinese, Malays, and Indians which can only  lead\r\n\r\nto  riots, violence and bloodshed, as happened in\r\n\r\nSingapore some years ago. The language and racial\r\n\r\nchauvinists  will  seize on this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nwhip up emotions and proclaim that Chinese, Malay\r\n\r\nand  Tamil  education  is  being  suppressed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Government recently  has  had  to\r\n\r\ntake  action  against journalists and  newspapers\r\n\r\nfor  precisely  this  reason.  For  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  continued stability and  prosperity,\r\n\r\nwe simply cannot allow a situation to be created,\r\n\r\ninnocently  or  otherwise,  where  the  continued\r\n\r\nstability of Singapore is threatened,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI would like to add a note to the chorus of praise\r\n\r\nfor the President's speech to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the President warned us against\r\n\r\nworking  up  heat on the gut issues over  language,\r\n\r\nculture  and religion. In our multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nwe  have more than our share of differences but  we\r\n\r\nshould  never  allow ourselves to be  engulfed.  We\r\n\r\nneed  to build bridges of understanding and pillars\r\n\r\nof  tolerance so that all Singaporeans,  no  matter\r\n\r\nthe  race, can strive for a better future  together\r\n\r\nin  peace.  Over the last 12 years, Government  has\r\n\r\nsought to instil the necessary values and attitudes\r\n\r\nfor the building of a cohesive society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key features of Government policy is\r\n\r\nbilingual  education,  where  each  child  achieves\r\n\r\nproficiency  in his own mother tongue and  English.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  vast  and vita' improvement  over  the\r\n\r\ncolonial-type of education which all of us in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  underwent where, if you went to an  English-medium  school,  unless you  could  afford  private\r\n\r\ntuition,  you  had  no opportunity  to  study  your\r\n\r\nmother tongue. In fact, I recall that even the  use\r\n\r\nof  one's  own dialect was severely discouraged  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Asian languages are rooted in strong\r\n\r\ncultures, the best features of which are  going  to\r\n\r\nbe  important  determinants of the  development  of\r\n\r\nAsian countries. Social discipline, respect for the\r\n\r\nolder  generation and for authority, the  love  and\r\n\r\nrespect  for learning-all these provide  resilience\r\n\r\nand  cohesiveness for a developing society. We need\r\n\r\nsuch  values  as  antidotes to  the  disintegrating\r\n\r\nforces of western hippie culture. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  need  mastery or English as a  tool  for  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic    development   since   many    of    the\r\n\r\ntechnological innovations stem for English-speaking\r\n\r\ncountries,  in  our multi-lingual society,  English\r\n\r\na1so    provides    a   convenient    bridge    for\r\n\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have peace and prosperity in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety  we  should therefore curb our  prejudices,\r\n\r\nallay our mutual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspicions,  mute the voices of extremism  and  dam\r\n\r\nthe  tides  of  passion.  There  must  be  constant\r\n\r\nvigilance  on  the  part of Government  to  prevent\r\n\r\nextremists  from  destroying  the  fabric  of   our\r\n\r\nsociety. We should stand firmly behind the  actions\r\n\r\ntaken by Government against those who seek to  play\r\n\r\nup   racial,   language,  cultural   or   religious\r\n\r\ndifferences for their own devious ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country but we are no less\r\n\r\nentitled to our independence -to the right to chart\r\n\r\nour  own  destiny.  There  are  insidious  external\r\n\r\nforces, which seek to manipulate public opinion  so\r\n\r\nas  to  weaken  our  national  will  and  make  our\r\n\r\nGovernment more pliable to their wishes.  The  mass\r\n\r\nmedia   are   particularly  susceptible   to   such\r\n\r\nmanipulation.  We should not confuse actions  taken\r\n\r\nby Government to preserve the autonomy of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith the denial of freedom of the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, especially intellectuals of western\r\n\r\nliberal  persuasion,  should be  more  positive  in\r\n\r\ntheir  appraisal  of social policies.  They  should\r\n\r\nbear in mind that in a developing country there  is\r\n\r\nso  much  building to be done that  free  criticism\r\n\r\nthat  lack  perspective and responsibility  can  be\r\n\r\nhighly  detrimental to the best  interests  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  are  also  a small  country  so  that\r\n\r\nindividual  actions  can have far  wider  and  more\r\n\r\nsignificant repercussions than similar  actions  in\r\n\r\nbigger  countries. A riot, for example, at  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity or the University of Singapore would  be\r\n\r\nof  grave  national  concern. In  America,  a  huge\r\n\r\ncountry,   with   hundreds  of   universities   and\r\n\r\ncolleges,  a  riot at any one of them  is  a  local\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge our intellectuals to be\r\n\r\nmore  realistic  and  to have greater  perspective.\r\n\r\nThey should not be so ready to hurl accusations  of\r\n\r\ndictatorship  and  label  our  society   a   closed\r\n\r\nsociety. People who do, remind me forcefully of the\r\n\r\nfable  of  the boy who cried \"wolf\" when there  was\r\n\r\nnone,  and  nobody heeded him when a  wolf  finally\r\n\r\ncame  and  devoured  him. Our intellectuals  should\r\n\r\nvisit  countries where democracy does not exist  to\r\n\r\nsee the vital differences for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we develop, our level of literacy and\r\n\r\nintellectual sophistication will grow. People will\r\n\r\nask more searching, more substantive questions  of\r\n\r\ntheir  leaders.  We must learn to  adjust  to  one\r\n\r\nanother. Political leaders will need not  only  to\r\n\r\nhave  substance in their programmes  but  will  be\r\n\r\nexpected  to  have  appropriate  style  as   well.\r\n\r\nIntellectuals outside the political arena must  be\r\n\r\nconstructive  and realistic if  they  wish  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously.  They should remember  that  the\r\n\r\nproblems  they perceive, though real and seemingly\r\n\r\nurgent,  may lose priority to bigger ones they  do\r\n\r\nnot see within their horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect a proper and rational dialogue, the\r\n\r\npress must play its part responsibly. The habit of\r\n\r\nslanting  reports or putting an angle to  a  story\r\n\r\nmake sensational headlines and presumably interest\r\n\r\nmore  readership. By doing so, however,  reporters\r\n\r\nand  editors do public figures grave injustice and\r\n\r\ndamage. Politicians are always subject to scrutiny\r\n\r\nand  what they say is always discounted with  some\r\n\r\nscepticism.  The  least  that  they   deserve   is\r\n\r\naccurate  coverage. I, for one, do  not  mind  any\r\n\r\namount   of  criticism,  provided  my  views   are\r\n\r\nrecorded   accurately.  I   consider   it   highly\r\n\r\nunethical,  if  not mischievous and  cowardly,  to\r\n\r\ndistort  anybody's  views and then  to  criticize,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  pseudonymous columns.  Let  it  be\r\n\r\nknown  to  such people that I am always  ready  to\r\n\r\ndebate with them publicly and fairly anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of society do we want- a society where\r\n\r\neveryone,    regardless   of   race    or    other\r\n\r\ndistinguishing characteristics, can have  equality\r\n\r\nof  opportunity, a decent job, a decent  home  and\r\n\r\nclean  surroundings,  or one where  people  suffer\r\n\r\ndiscrimination, talk in hushed whispers  and  walk\r\n\r\nthe  streets in fear? From time to time the under-currents  of intolerance emerge in the columns  of\r\n\r\nour  newspapers.  Not too long ago, for  example,\r\n\r\nthere   were  a  spate  of  letters  from  readers\r\n\r\ndiscussing the appropriate use or non-use of  non-Chinese  names  by Chinese. Do we want  a  society\r\n\r\nwhere we measure the worth of a man by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkind  of name he has, or by the way he writes  his\r\n\r\nname?  I  do not want such a society, and,  if  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  be,  I  do  not want  my  children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren to live in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country, Sir, but limited though\r\n\r\nwe   are   by  lack  of  land  and  other  natural\r\n\r\nresources,  there  is  no limit  to  the  economic\r\n\r\nheights  that we can attain, provided we  organize\r\n\r\nourselves  properly and peacefully to acquire  the\r\n\r\nnecessary skills and to apply the ingenuity of our\r\n\r\npeople.  With  economic affluence  we  shall  have\r\n\r\nplenty  of  room  for cultural development.  There\r\n\r\nwill, in other words, be plenty of room for all of\r\n\r\nus  and our children and grandchildren provided we\r\n\r\nare willing to be tolerant and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With firm and fair government, we are doing\r\n\r\nwell. Our economy is flourishing and will continue\r\n\r\nto flourish provided we are able to project enough\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  the  investor,  whether  local  or\r\n\r\nforeign,  so  that he will build  his  factory  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the jobs we need. Our standard of  living\r\n\r\nwill  rise in two stages. In the initial stage  we\r\n\r\nearn  higher  wages  by learning  more  skills  as\r\n\r\ntechnicians,  engineers,  managers  and  marketing\r\n\r\npersonnel.  Then, when our economy  grows  richer,\r\n\r\neven  those  with  no skills  can  have  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of living because we shall  be  able  to\r\n\r\nafford it collectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic organisation of our economy, given the\r\n\r\npeculiar conditions we have, is necessarily  based\r\n\r\non   a   capitalistic,  free  enterprise   system.\r\n\r\nGovernment policy, at present and in the immediate\r\n\r\nfuture,  has  to be geared towards  providing  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and the inducements  to  stimulate\r\n\r\neconomic  activity. There is  a  danger  that,  in\r\n\r\npursuing  these  necessary  objectives,   we   may\r\n\r\nproduce   large   numbers   of   technocrats   and\r\n\r\nbureaucrats   with   no   social   compassion   or\r\n\r\nsensitivity. From time to time, therefore, we need\r\n\r\nto  remind ourselves of our socialistic aims of  a\r\n\r\nmore  equal and more just society. We need to give\r\n\r\nadequate thought to the problems of the poor,  the\r\n\r\nweak,  the  disabled and the displaced.  Sometimes\r\n\r\npolicy  measures, though economically and socially\r\n\r\nindispensable, bear harshly on certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsectors.  In  this respect, I greatly welcome  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's move to increase compensation for the\r\n\r\nresettlement of farmers and shopkeepers and others\r\n\r\naffected  by  urban renewal. Our national  welfare\r\n\r\ncan rightly be considered to have improved if, and\r\n\r\nonly  if, those who are made better off do so  not\r\n\r\nat the expense of others, or, if they do, there is\r\n\r\nadequate and fair compensation. The poorer classes\r\n\r\nshould,  as a matter of firm principle,  never  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  pay  for economic or social  development\r\n\r\nunless they themselves are clear beneficiaries  in\r\n\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a society where the great majority of people\r\n\r\nare  poor  and  oppressed, there is  yet  hope  of\r\n\r\nredress via a revolution, because intelligent,  if\r\n\r\nnot   developed,  leadership  exists  among  them.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a modern, technological society, where\r\n\r\nmuch  of the brainpower has emerged into the upper\r\n\r\nand  controlling strata of society, the poor  have\r\n\r\nneither political power via the voting booth,  nor\r\n\r\narticulate  leadership among  their  ranks.  In  a\r\n\r\ndeveloped    society,   clearly   the    political\r\n\r\nleadership  must avoid the hegemony of the  middle\r\n\r\nand upper income classes if the poor people are to\r\n\r\nget a fair deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, therefore, work for a society in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where,  on  the one  hand,  people  are\r\n\r\nrewarded and promoted on strict merit, and, on the\r\n\r\nother,  ample opportunities are afforded to  those\r\n\r\nwho  are hampered by poverty. In other words,  let\r\n\r\nus  build  not  merely  a society  based  only  on\r\n\r\nmeritocracy,  but  let us have a  meritocracy-plus\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key measures available to a\r\n\r\ngovernment  in  a  democratic country  to  promote\r\n\r\ngreater  equality is the judicious use of the  tax\r\n\r\nsystem.  I think it is time we had a comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  of our system of taxation to achieve  more\r\n\r\nsocialism  without  hurting  efficiency.   Certain\r\n\r\ntaxes  are  inherently regressive, that  is,  they\r\n\r\nbear  on  people who can least afford them.  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the incidence of  such  taxes  as\r\n\r\ntaxes  on P.U.B, bills, for example. Although  the\r\n\r\ntax  is  graduated  with a higher  tax  on  bigger\r\n\r\nbills,   poor  people  with  large  families   and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  using  more  utilities  are  adversely\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should also be taxes to discourage\r\n\r\nlavish  consumption.  The reasons  for  advocating\r\n\r\nsuch  taxes  are both economic and socialistic.  A\r\n\r\nwidening  income  gap between  rich  and  poor  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  in  a society with rapid  development,\r\n\r\nunless  there is government intervention.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst   place,  low-income  people  can  be  given\r\n\r\ngreater   earning  power  through  education   and\r\n\r\ntraining.  We  can justify the rich  having  more,\r\n\r\nprovided  most of the accretion goes into  further\r\n\r\ninvestment  to provide more jobs. If, instead,  it\r\n\r\ngoes  into lavish consumption, then the Government\r\n\r\nshould introduce taxes to take some of it away  to\r\n\r\nbe   spent  on  the  poor.  Moreover,  if   lavish\r\n\r\nconsumption is not controlled or discouraged,  the\r\n\r\ndemonstration  effect may be upsetting  to  poorer\r\n\r\npeople and may affect their motivation to work and\r\n\r\nto  save  adversely.  The  Government,  therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  seriously consider heavy excise  taxes  on\r\n\r\nluxury-type  cars, luxury-type flats, houses,  and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like next to comment on\r\n\r\nthe programmes for a number of Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment is in reference to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of higher education which comes within\r\n\r\nthe   purview  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology.   I  am  wondering  if  the   Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  has  in  mind an  optimal  size  for  a\r\n\r\nuniversity. Sir, administration becomes  difficult\r\n\r\nand  impersonal when the student population  glows\r\n\r\ntoo big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there are always dissidents in any\r\n\r\ngroup,  but  in a large congregation the  absolute\r\n\r\nnumber of such people becomes significant and  can\r\n\r\nlead  to  the  kind of student unrest  we  see  in\r\n\r\nwestern countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may, therefore, be more desirable to increase\r\n\r\nthe  number of universities rather than have fewer\r\n\r\nlarge ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum to the Ministry of Labour lists a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  important new policies.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Minister  for  Labour  may  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  status  of daily-rated  workers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments and statutory bodies,  Can\r\n\r\nanything be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  to,  perhaps, give them more  regularity  or\r\n\r\npermanency in employment? Would the Minister  also\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  reorganisation of the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  in order to provide a better picture  of\r\n\r\nthe   unemployment  situation   so   that   better\r\n\r\nplacement  of people can be effected, and  perhaps\r\n\r\nupgrading of local skills can be facilitated?  The\r\n\r\nMinister  may also want to consider opening  other\r\n\r\n`employment  exchanges to improve the  process  of\r\n\r\nplacing people into desired jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the Ministry of Health,\r\n\r\nespecially with respect to hawkers. The allocation\r\n\r\nof  $5  million to build new hawker centres  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  welcome  move.  Hawking  provides  jobs  for\r\n\r\nunskilled   and   uneducated  people,   especially\r\n\r\nwidows,  older  people  and  people  affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement.  It is an important  social  welfare\r\n\r\nsupplement,  and  hence  a very  important  social\r\n\r\nsafety valve. It is important in keeping down  the\r\n\r\ncost of living. Moreover, it is potentially a good\r\n\r\ntourist  attraction. There should be efforts  made\r\n\r\nto help improve health and cooking standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may also wish to look into the\r\n\r\nmatter  of better collaboration with the  Hawkers'\r\n\r\nSection  of  the  Housing and  Development  Board.\r\n\r\nThere  is  one particular anomaly, which adversely\r\n\r\naffects  hawkers under the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard's   jurisdiction.  This   relates   to   the\r\n\r\nobligation of the Housing and Development Board to\r\n\r\npay  property  tax of 36 per cent  a  year,  which\r\n\r\nthereby  raises the fees payable by  its  hawkers.\r\n\r\nThose  hawker  centres which are  managed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health are exempt from property tax. I\r\n\r\nwould  appeal  to  the  Minister  for  Health   to\r\n\r\nsubsidize the Housing and Development Board on the\r\n\r\nproperty tax on hawker centres so as to reduce the\r\n\r\nlicence  fees  payable by these hawkers  and  make\r\n\r\nthings more equitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to raise two matters relating to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance. Sometime in  April  this\r\n\r\nyear, on my return from a trade mission to Japan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  made a number of recommendations in respect  of\r\n\r\nexport   promotion  and  financing.  Perhaps   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will inform this House in due\r\n\r\ncourse what steps, if any, are being taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the major thrust of the Government\r\n\r\nindustrialization programme has been  towards  the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  foreign investment.  While  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  correct, if we are  to  acquire  the\r\n\r\ntechnological  sophistication, the managerial  and\r\n\r\nmarketing know-how in the shortest possible  time,\r\n\r\nI think that with full employment in sight, we can\r\n\r\nturn  part  of  our attention and  effort  to  the\r\n\r\nactive promotion of local enterprise. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can help identify and preserve  limited\r\n\r\nareas  of economic activity which local enterprise\r\n\r\nand  capital  can  be encouraged  to  go  into  or\r\n\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the President's speech he lamented the\r\n\r\nrecent   financial  coup  achieved  by  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncompany.  May  I  ask  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwhether,  and what, measures are being  considered\r\n\r\nto prevent a repetition of the incident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A.

Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as 1971 comes to\r\n\r\na close five months from today, Singapore, for the\r\n\r\nfirst time in its history, will no longer have the\r\n\r\ndefence  umbrella to which it has grown accustomed\r\n\r\nfor the last 150 years. We shall, despite the Five-Power  Defence arrangement, have to be more  self-\r\n\r\nreliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was stated in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address at the opening of the  Second\r\n\r\nSession  of the Second Parliament on the  21st  of\r\n\r\nJuly,  Singapore's  foreign policy  in  the  years\r\n\r\nahead will have to be more outward-looking than it\r\n\r\nhas  hitherto  been, because, among other  things,\r\n\r\nexternal  developments will be more directly  felt\r\n\r\nby  us.  Singapore, by virtue of its size,  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  to  influence  international  events.  And\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  of  our  small  size  and  our\r\n\r\ninability to influence world\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevents,  we  might  have become inward-looking  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  insular in our concept and  practice  of\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapidly changing international scene in\r\n\r\nthe  Pacific and Indian Oceans, we have to develop\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  to  play our role in  international\r\n\r\naffairs  by  involving ourselves in intra-regional\r\n\r\nor  sub-regional developments. We  can  no  longer\r\n\r\nthink of our own individual and national interests\r\n\r\nas  the powers and super-powers around us make new\r\n\r\nmoves, and  take  on  new  alignments.  We   are\r\n\r\nrealistic   enough  to  know  that   international\r\n\r\npolitics  on  a  global scale is the  art  of  the\r\n\r\npossible.  And  in line with this view,  we  shall\r\n\r\nparticipate in international politics wherever and\r\n\r\nwhenever  it is judicious and possible to  do  so,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind our own interests and those of our\r\n\r\nimmediate neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the above, there is, however, one\r\n\r\ncontribution Singapore can make in a positive  way\r\n\r\nin  international relations. This is to  create  a\r\n\r\nprogressive,  dynamic and successful  society,  by\r\n\r\nregistering   successes  in   our   own   internal\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programmes  and  thereby  influencing\r\n\r\nother  states  and  societies by  sheer  force  of\r\n\r\nexample.  At the same time, our growing prosperity\r\n\r\nand   continued  viability  will  ensure  a  self-confidence generated by our capacity to solve  our\r\n\r\nown  internal  economic and social problems.  With\r\n\r\nthis,  we  hope  to  be a positive  force  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational sphere in the hope that we would  be\r\n\r\nfreer  to order the kind of life, which we  think,\r\n\r\nis  best  for our people. In other words, we  hope\r\n\r\nthat  non-interference in  the  affairs  of  other\r\n\r\nnations,  which we believe in, will  similarly  be\r\n\r\npractised by others in their attitudes towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience in international politics, we\r\n\r\nknow that in many cases if the big powers want  to\r\n\r\nsolve  international  problems,  irrespective   of\r\n\r\nwhether they are in the Middle East, Indochina  or\r\n\r\nAfrica,  they can solve them. But, all too  often,\r\n\r\nit  appears as if the big powers sometimes have an\r\n\r\ninterest in not solving them, or in delaying their\r\n\r\nsolutions. In this regard, it is clear  to  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  that the big powers in many cases  want\r\n\r\nto make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse   of   small   states  as   weights   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational daching. Where we are convinced that\r\n\r\nthe  big powers are so motivated, we shall, to the\r\n\r\nbest   of   our   ability,  avoid  any   kind   of\r\n\r\ninvolvement.   But  where  we   feel   that   such\r\n\r\nactivities  are  detrimental to our  own  national\r\n\r\ninterests, we shall counter any moves, which  will\r\n\r\ncompromise our independence and integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have been independent for only six\r\n\r\nyears,  we have learned the bitter truth  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  disastrous for small countries  to  act\r\n\r\nlike major powers on the world stage, particularly\r\n\r\nif  they  do  not  have the  capacity  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to  force ourselves on  to  the  world\r\n\r\nstage  without really understanding the  aims  and\r\n\r\nobjectives of the producers and directors  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  play being performed, would mean breaking\r\n\r\nour backs and seriously injuring ourselves. Events\r\n\r\nin  the Middle East, Indochina and other parts  of\r\n\r\nAsia  and Africa have persistently shown that  the\r\n\r\nbig powers want us to declare that we are on their\r\n\r\nside   in  big  power  conflicts.  This  we   have\r\n\r\nrefrained  and  must refrain  from  doing  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Nixon's move as announced on the 16th\r\n\r\nJuly  will, I think, lead to the establishment  of\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the People's Republic  of  China.\r\n\r\nThis  development is historically inevitable.
