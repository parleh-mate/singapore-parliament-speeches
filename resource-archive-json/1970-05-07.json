Until we are sure that the effects\r\n\r\nof  the rundown of British military spending  have\r\n\r\nbeen  more  than  offset by an  expansion  in  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  and servicing sectors of the  economy,\r\n\r\nwe  must be cautious and discourage wage increases\r\n\r\nwhich are not matched by higher productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is that I wish to appoint the\r\n\r\nnew  Member  of  Parliament  for  Havelock  to  an\r\n\r\nimportant Ministry. Sir, it is not fair to ask any\r\n\r\nman,  however conscientious and faithful a  public\r\n\r\nservant the Member for Havelock has been, to  take\r\n\r\non    a    Ministry    which    carries    heavier\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  than  the  Development  Bank  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for a salary of $2,500 per month. It  is\r\n\r\nso   unrealistic  and  so  unrelated  to   present\r\n\r\nconditions  in  Singapore,  and  to  what  he   is\r\n\r\ngetting,  and  to  what  is the  remuneration  for\r\n\r\nhigher  executives in commerce and  industry,  and\r\n\r\neven for senior members in the professions. Senior\r\n\r\nlawyers  put in income tax returns of over $20,000\r\n\r\na month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that if I asked him to, the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock would be willing to make a sacrifice  and\r\n\r\nserve  at  the present salary. But if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nattract  men of ability to serve as Ministers,  in\r\n\r\nother words, to run for election and then serve as\r\n\r\nMinisters,  Singapore cannot, for  the  indefinite\r\n\r\nfuture,  rely  on people who are willing  to  make\r\n\r\ninordinate sacrifices, particularly when it is  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No group of men, either in commerce or industry\r\n\r\nor  in  academe,  are  as crucial  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontinued  security and prosperity as  the  eleven\r\n\r\nwho  form  the  Cabinet.  The  leadership  that  a\r\n\r\ngovernment provides determines whether  a  country\r\n\r\nis stable and prosperous, or chaotic and bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAnd what has happened to a number of new countries\r\n\r\nshould warn us of the dangers Singapore faces if a\r\n\r\nsecond generation leadership is not equal to their\r\n\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had considered the possibility of raising\r\n\r\nthe salaries for the Member for Havelock and for a\r\n\r\nfew  other Ministers for whom $2,500 would be  out\r\n\r\nof  all  proportion  to  what  they  were  earning\r\n\r\noutside the Government and whose family needs  are\r\n\r\nalso  pressing. I decided against  it.  To  do  so\r\n\r\nwould be discriminatory and arbitrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that it would not be\r\n\r\npossible  to have men of ability and integrity  to\r\n\r\nbecome  Ministers  at  these  salaries,  once  the\r\n\r\npresent  Ministers leave office. If  Ministers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  not  expected to  be  scrupulously\r\n\r\nhonest, then that is quite a different matter. For\r\n\r\nthen  their  Ministerial  salaries  can  be  token\r\n\r\npayments  for  purposes  of  income  tax  returns,\r\n\r\nwhilst fortunes are accumulated in kick-backs  and\r\n\r\nrake-offs, for licences, contracts, and a  hundred\r\n\r\nand  one  acts  of  the  exercise  of  Ministerial\r\n\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, therefore, decided to recommend to\r\n\r\nMembers  to increase the salaries of Ministers  in\r\n\r\nCabinet from $2,500 to $4,500 per month; Ministers\r\n\r\nof   State  from  $2,000  to  $2,500  per   month;\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries from $1,500 to $1,750  a\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not increasing my own salary of $3,500 a\r\n\r\nmonth. My salary will stay as it is until the  end\r\n\r\nof  1972,  by  which  time Singapore  should  have\r\n\r\novercome  the  economic  problems  caused  by  the\r\n\r\nrundown  in British military expenditure, provided\r\n\r\nwe   all   work   hard  for  higher   and   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  and more and more industries.  I  am\r\n\r\nable  to  do  this  only  because  my  wife  is  a\r\n\r\npractising solicitor with an adequate income. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit   is  unrealistic  to  expect  the  next  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  one qualified for the job, to discharge\r\n\r\nthe  functions  of  this office  for  the  present\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile my colleagues and I are hoping to\r\n\r\nattract  young  men  and  women  of  ability   and\r\n\r\nintegrity to take up political work and  stand  as\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament.  From  several  selection\r\n\r\nexercises we have held since 1965 to get new blood\r\n\r\ninto  this  House, we know that many young  people\r\n\r\nare  reluctant  to  undertake political  life  and\r\n\r\nstand  for  election, first, because their  public\r\n\r\nand  private lives are immediately put under close\r\n\r\nand  constant scrutiny, and next, because  of  the\r\n\r\ntime   and   effort  required  of  a   Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament, all for $500 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I have, therefore, decided\r\n\r\nthat  we should raise M.P.s' allowances to  $1,000\r\n\r\nper  month.  I  am not suggesting that  this  will\r\n\r\nsolve  the problem. But it will help. At the  next\r\n\r\nsitting   of   Parliament  I  shall  introduce   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary budget for these changes to be  made\r\n\r\nfrom 1st June, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost will be about $300,000 per annum for\r\n\r\nthe   increase  in  the  M.P.s'  allowances,   and\r\n\r\n$300,000  per  annum  for  the  increase  in   the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  Ministers, Ministers  of  State  and\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretaries.  No   increases   are\r\n\r\nproposed  for Political Secretaries, for  normally\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  be  Members of  Parliament  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the  rationale for the increases  does\r\n\r\nnot apply to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the 70's, it is my hope that this\r\n\r\nParliament  can attract enough men of quality  and\r\n\r\nintegrity   to   maintain  honest  and   efficient\r\n\r\nstandards   of  administration,  and  to   provide\r\n\r\ncapable leadership for Singapore. Social, economic\r\n\r\nand  political conditions have changed  enormously\r\n\r\nsince  1955, and motivations for seeking political\r\n\r\noffice  have  also changed. But I believe  we  can\r\n\r\nproduce   a   second  generation  leadership,   as\r\n\r\ncompetent  and  honest, and with a  bit  of  luck,\r\n\r\nperhaps also as dedicated and determined as  those\r\n\r\ncolleagues  of mine who have been in office  since\r\n\r\n1959.  If we can succeed in this, then Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture for the 1980's and beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be assured.

First of all, Sir, will the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister indicate whether or not  the  four\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament who resigned from this House\r\n\r\nlast  month would come into this category to enjoy\r\n\r\ntheir  pensions?

Thirdly,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  he  not  inform this House, apart  from  the\r\n\r\nreasons   he  gave  just  now,  why  he  has   not\r\n\r\nrecommended an increase in his own salary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply\r\n\r\nto  the first question, whether the increases will\r\n\r\napply  to the four Members of Parliament who  have\r\n\r\nresigned, the answer, with great regret, is no. We\r\n\r\nconsidered  this matter carefully. If we  were  to\r\n\r\napply it to them and have their pensions based  on\r\n\r\n$1,000 per month, then we, as a government,  would\r\n\r\nbe  going  against a principle for which  we  have\r\n\r\nalways  stood, namely, that wage increases  should\r\n\r\nnever   be   back-dated  or  made   retrospective.\r\n\r\nParliamentary  pensions for M.P.s' allowances  and\r\n\r\nMinisters'  salaries are calculated  on  the  mean\r\n\r\naverage of their last three years. So if it is  to\r\n\r\nbe  altered for the four former M.P.s, the present\r\n\r\nallowances  would  have  to  be  back-dated  three\r\n\r\nyears.  It is irresponsible for any government  to\r\n\r\nset  such  a precedent. Apart from grave  problems\r\n\r\nthat   would  be  posed  not  only  to   employers\r\n\r\ngenerally,  the  Minister  for  Finance  will   be\r\n\r\npressed, because every wage increase made, will be\r\n\r\nasked  to  be  retrospective. I know  that  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable that former Members like Mr Lee  Teck\r\n\r\nI  Tim, after having served 11 years, will  get  a\r\n\r\npension  of  only $170 a month. I suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol that perhaps his feelings  of\r\n\r\ncomradeship  and loyalty to Mr Lee Teck  Him  are\r\n\r\nsuch  as  to  make  a  call on  his  generous  and\r\n\r\ncharitable disposition, and that of other Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The second question is about the\r\n\r\nincrease in the Prime Minister's salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have already given the\r\n\r\nreason.

The  Bill\r\n\r\nfuses  the  jurisdictions of the lower  courts  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   civil  and  criminal  matters.   It\r\n\r\nprovides, inter alia, for both civil and  criminal\r\n\r\njurisdictions to be exercised not only by District\r\n\r\nCourts  but also by Magistrates' Courts. We  shall\r\n\r\nthus  no longer have the separation between  Civil\r\n\r\nDistrict  Courts and Criminal District  Courts  as\r\n\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil jurisdiction of the District Court\r\n\r\nwill also be raised to $5,000 with powers to award\r\n\r\nequitable remedies like an injunction or  specific\r\n\r\nperformance.  This  will  effectively  off-load  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount of work that  has  previously\r\n\r\nbeen   dealt   with   in  the  High   Court.   The\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of the Civil District Court  is  now\r\n\r\n$2,000,  and  the  court has  no  power  to  grant\r\n\r\nequitable remedies. Any claim for more than $2,000\r\n\r\nor  an action praying for equitable remedies  must\r\n\r\nbe  instituted  in the High Court. Care,  however,\r\n\r\nhas  been  taken to ensure that this  increase  in\r\n\r\njurisdiction will not deny a litigant the right to\r\n\r\npursue  his own claim without the aid of  counsel.\r\n\r\nThe  Civil District Court has always been regarded\r\n\r\nas  \"a  poor man's court\" where he can pursue  his\r\n\r\nclaim with the aid of officials of the Court.

The\r\n\r\nstructure  of  our  system  of  administration  of\r\n\r\njustice  is  such that officers appointed  to  the\r\n\r\njudicial and legal service may be called  upon  to\r\n\r\nserve  in  capacities that would require  them  to\r\n\r\nassume  the  role of prosecutor, legal adviser  to\r\n\r\nGovernment1  as  well  as that  of  Magistrate  or\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge, according to the exigencies of the\r\n\r\nservice. An officer would, therefore, be given the\r\n\r\nsame  rounded experience both in the  criminal  as\r\n\r\nwell as in the civil fields of law, whether he  is\r\n\r\na  District Judge or Magistrate, in the  Attorney-General's   Chambers,   the  Official   Assignee's\r\n\r\nDepartment or the Legal Aid Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also affords our subordinate courts\r\n\r\ngreater  powers to commit for contempt  of  court.\r\n\r\nProvisions  relating to this are  set  out  in  no\r\n\r\nuncertain  terms  so that those administering  the\r\n\r\nlaw  will  have adequate powers and  authority  to\r\n\r\nmaintain at all times the dignity of the Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee;
