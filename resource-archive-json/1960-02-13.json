Does it just mean anybody who\r\n\r\nintervenes,  arid  what interest  must  he  have\r\n\r\nbefore he intervenes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Any party who can show an  interest\r\n\r\nor  any person, who can show an interest in the\r\n\r\nintervention, intervenes. And it will be up  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court  to  decide whether to  accept  that\r\n\r\ninterest  as a legitimate intervening  interest\r\n\r\nwhen such intervention is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I submit, with respect, Sir, that\r\n\r\n\"intervener\" probably had a meaning when \"trade\r\n\r\nunion\"  meant a trade union of employers,  too.\r\n\r\nBut  so  far as \"employer\" is concerned at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  I do not see how anybody can intervene\r\n\r\non  his  behalf.  Maybe an  intervention  could\r\n\r\nstill  take place with regard to a trade  union\r\n\r\nof  employees, but with regard to the employer,\r\n\r\nI  do not see how anybody can intervene on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf  except he himself - he is left  to  fight\r\n\r\nhis  own  battle. But if an employer  has  been\r\n\r\nserved  under  clause 16 by a  trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployees,  then  a  trade union  of  employers\r\n\r\ncould  intervene under clause 62.  Now  that  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union of employers is out of the picture\r\n\r\nentirely, and the employer is left to fight his\r\n\r\nown  battle, I do not see who would be  foolish\r\n\r\nenough  to intervene on his behalf - in a  losing\r\n\r\nbattle anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has this anything to do with the\r\n\r\namendment before the House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Sir, it will have something to\r\n\r\ndo with it when I speak later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park has not envisaged a situation which\r\n\r\nvery  often  can arise. Let us  say  a  dispute\r\n\r\narises between the Aerated Water Workers' Union\r\n\r\nand  the  Phoenix Aerated Water Company  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  would  be the fair rates of pay  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The  decision on  that  would  affect\r\n\r\nFraser &Neave, and members of the union who are\r\n\r\nin  Fraser & Neave. Therefore, it is quite open\r\n\r\nfor  another  firm, also in the  aerated  water\r\n\r\nbusiness, to want to intervene and say, \"Whilst\r\n\r\nthe Court is considering the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwages  and conditions of service and the  state\r\n\r\nof   the   industry,  I  would  like  to   give\r\n\r\nevidence.\" It is true that the award would only\r\n\r\nbe  binding on the immediate parties before the\r\n\r\nCourt, but a party in a similar industry  might\r\n\r\nwant  to  come in and say, \"Let me  present  my\r\n\r\nfacts  as  I  see  them.\"  In  that  case,  the\r\n\r\nemployer would be an intervener. Or vice-versa,\r\n\r\nit might be that the workers in Phoenix Aerated\r\n\r\nWater  Company might belong to one trade union,\r\n\r\nand  the  workers in Fraser & Neave in  similar\r\n\r\noccupations might belong to another,  and  they\r\n\r\nmight want to come in and give evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the latest\r\n\r\nsubmission by the Member for Farrer  Park  adds\r\n\r\nconsiderable    weight   to    my    suggestion\r\n\r\nearlier - that  the Front Benchers opposite  have\r\n\r\ntaken  very  little trouble to  understand  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of this Bill. If the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark would look at clause 61 (1), he would  see\r\n\r\nthat there is provision for the State Advocate-General  to  intervene in any  dispute  in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest.

In the Bill  as  it\r\n\r\nwas  originally,  the concept was  to  hold  the\r\n\r\nbalance   evenly  between  the   two   disputing\r\n\r\nparties.   In  my  view,  clause   62   is   not\r\n\r\nunreasonable in trying to shut out advocates and\r\n\r\nsolicitors, because it also shuts out  everybody\r\n\r\nelse,  so  far  as  the union of  employees  was\r\n\r\nconcerned.  The clause says that only  a  person\r\n\r\nwho   is  a  full-time  secretary  or  assistant\r\n\r\nsecretary may appear for a union. That  is  fair\r\n\r\nenough. But after representations have been made\r\n\r\nby  trade  unions of employees to the  Minister,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   now  proposes  to   alter   the\r\n\r\ndefinition,  Mr Speaker, Sir, as  appearing  in\r\n\r\npage  54  of  the  Order Paper Supplement  [12th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1960] -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the new\r\n\r\nSupplement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Anyway, the proposed new paragraph\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) \"officer\", in relation to a trade union\r\n\r\nincludes  for  the purposes of  any  proceedings\r\n\r\nbefore the Court a person appointed by the body,\r\n\r\nby whatever name called, to which the management\r\n\r\nof  the  affairs of the union is  entrusted,  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the trade union in those proceedings.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs  I  understand it, a trade union of employees\r\n\r\ncould  appoint anybody, other than  an  advocate\r\n\r\nand  solicitor,  to represent  them  under  that\r\n\r\nparagraph.  So  that X union could  appoint  the\r\n\r\nsecretary  of  Y union, or vice-versa.  Or  they\r\n\r\ncould  appoint  a  complete  outsider  who   has\r\n\r\nspecialised in trade union activities. So far as\r\n\r\nthe trade union of employees is concerned, there\r\n\r\nare  two  additional weights  in  their  favour.\r\n\r\nFirst,   they  have  been  given  the   use   by\r\n\r\nGovernment,   at  government  expense,   of   an\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Officer, who is himself  an\r\n\r\nofficer trained in such matters and who would be\r\n\r\nable  to  plead for the trade union of employees\r\n\r\nin  a  manner perhaps even better than can  some\r\n\r\nadvocates  and solicitors, because he  has  been\r\n\r\ntrained  in that particular branch of Government\r\n\r\nwork  or trade union work. Over and above  that,\r\n\r\nthere  are also persons at the disposal of trade\r\n\r\nunions   of   employees   who   themselves   are\r\n\r\nspecialists. Mr Speaker, Sir, recently  we  had\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstance  where one Political Secretary attached\r\n\r\nto the Government was given leave of absence. He\r\n\r\nwent  and so ably conducted the case for a trade\r\n\r\nunion of employees that they won the case.  Such\r\n\r\na  person would be available to all trade unions\r\n\r\nof employees who find themselves in difficulties\r\n\r\nwith their employers. Now, the balance has again\r\n\r\nbeen upset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a trade union of employers could\r\n\r\ntake  up  the cudgels on behalf of an  employer,\r\n\r\nthere were some reasons to exclude advocates and\r\n\r\nsolicitors, because the trade union of employers\r\n\r\nthemselves might have secretaries who were  well\r\n\r\nversed  in  these  matters, and therefore  those\r\n\r\npersons  would have been able to appear for  the\r\n\r\nemployer in question. But now that too has  been\r\n\r\nshut out. An employer must stand on his own.  He\r\n\r\ncannot go to a trade union of employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you get the position, Sir, where two\r\n\r\nweights  have been added in favour of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion of employees, and one weight which was  in\r\n\r\nfavour of the trade union of employers has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  away. It is not always true, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that an employer is a very rich person.  An\r\n\r\nemployer might be just struggling along like  an\r\n\r\nemployee. There are several very small employers\r\n\r\nin Singapore- persons who run a sewing business,\r\n\r\na  tailoring  business, or a little  coffee-shop\r\n\r\n-and   they  might  have  employees.   And   the\r\n\r\nemployees  might  have a dispute  with  such  an\r\n\r\nemployer.  The  employer might be an  illiterate\r\n\r\nperson.  Though  very keen  and  clever  in  his\r\n\r\nbusiness,   he  might  be  quite  incapable   of\r\n\r\npresenting his case to the Arbitration Court  or\r\n\r\neven  before a conciliation officer. Do  we  not\r\n\r\nknow  of  instances,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  where\r\n\r\npeople  who are so voluble outside dry  up  once\r\n\r\nyou ask them to stand on their feet and talk? It\r\n\r\nis  a  gift  to  be able to talk sensibly  under\r\n\r\npressure, and not all persons can do that. So at\r\n\r\nevery  point,  the  employer  is  faced  with  a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage. How then can this be  weighted  in\r\n\r\nhis favour again? If he cannot avail himself  of\r\n\r\nsomebody, then who could plead his case  without\r\n\r\nfear  or  favour? Would not that  person  be  an\r\n\r\nadvocate  and  solicitor? Why is he  being  shut\r\n\r\nout?  Originally, Sir, there was some point  and\r\n\r\npurpose   in  the  Bill,  because  things   were\r\n\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly  secretaries and assistant  secretaries  of\r\n\r\nunions could appear for the unions. But now that\r\n\r\nhas  been  extended to cover everybody, provided\r\n\r\nhe  is  not  a  paid agent or  an  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Labour and Law,\r\n\r\nthe  main objection to employing an advocate and\r\n\r\nsolicitor was that it was an expensive business.\r\n\r\nSir,  if an employer wants to engage an advocate\r\n\r\nand  solicitor  at his expense, why  should  the\r\n\r\nMinister  object to that? Also,  why  should  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union of employees object to an  employer\r\n\r\nincurring  expense  in order  to  put  his  case\r\n\r\ncorrectly?  If, as the Minister says,  advocates\r\n\r\nand  solicitors charge high fees  appearing  for\r\n\r\ntrade unions of employees, well, the unions  are\r\n\r\nnot interested in advocates and solicitors. They\r\n\r\nhave got the Industrial Relations Officers,  who\r\n\r\nwould  be  doing these jobs and doing them  very\r\n\r\nwell,  available to them. So the unions are  all\r\n\r\nright. Therefore, to say that because of expense\r\n\r\nan  employer should be deprived of the  services\r\n\r\nof  an  advocate and solicitor does not  somehow\r\n\r\nseem right to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said, Sir, that skilled and\r\n\r\norderly  presentation of a  case  would  give  a\r\n\r\ntrade  dispute a forensic character.  I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndefer with the Minister on that point, because a\r\n\r\ngood  administrator can present the  facts  with\r\n\r\nskill and order. He need not be an advocate, and\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  doing that, is his  Ministry  a\r\n\r\nplace  where forensic matters are being thrashed\r\n\r\nout?  All that is needed is somebody to put  the\r\n\r\npoints succinctly and clearly to the Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt. That is what is normally expected  of  an\r\n\r\nadvocate arid solicitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another point the Minister made was\r\n\r\nthat  if  an  advocate  and solicitor  appeared,\r\n\r\nthere would not be that informality which is  so\r\n\r\nessential  in  the Arbitration  Court.  I  would\r\n\r\nsubmit to the Minister with respect that if  the\r\n\r\nMinister wanted the Court to be informal,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure an advocate would make it very informal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further point that advocates tend to\r\n\r\nbecome   technical.  Advocates  do  not   become\r\n\r\ntechnical on their own, Mr Speaker, Sir. I take\r\n\r\nit that the President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Court  would  lay down  rules  for  the\r\n\r\nguidance   of  the  Court,  and  advocates   and\r\n\r\nsolicitors  would be guided by those  rules.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  then  is it necessary to shut out advocates\r\n\r\nand   solicitors,  particularly  now   that   an\r\n\r\nemployer has been deprived of the assistance  of\r\n\r\na trade union of employers, and the employer has\r\n\r\nto stand on his own feet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to clause 62 (1) (a) again, it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"being a trade union may be represented by an\r\n\r\nofficer of the trade union;\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>and with the amendment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or, in the case of a trade union of employees,\r\n\r\nby  an  officer  of the trade union  or  by  an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Officer selected  by  the\r\n\r\ntrade union.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs  the Minister himself has said, a trade union\r\n\r\nmust now exclude a trade union of employers, and\r\n\r\nparagraph  (a)  refers  to  a  trade  union   of\r\n\r\nemployees. And paragraph (b), Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"not being a trade union,\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I take it this now refers to an employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"may be represented by an employee of that\r\n\r\nparty\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>in other words, an employer may either\r\n\r\nappear himself or get his employee to appear for\r\n\r\nhim, or an intervener. Sir. \"represented by an\r\n\r\nintervener\" means, I take it, somebody who\r\n\r\nappears on his behalf. Who could appear on his\r\n\r\nbehalf? Not a trade union of employers - \r\n\r\nthey are shut out. And not the State Advocate-General. So it must be somebody for and on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the employer and at his behest! If\r\n\r\nthat is an intervener, I do not know whether we\r\n\r\nhave got the right meaning of \"intervener\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole objection to an advocate and\r\n\r\nsolicitor, in the first instance, Sir, was  that\r\n\r\nhe would upset the balance, because the employer\r\n\r\nwould  be able to employ him, but not the  trade\r\n\r\nunion of employees. Now that the trade union  of\r\n\r\nemployees  has been sufficiently and  adequately\r\n\r\nprotected, in so far as their representation  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  why then should they now  object  to\r\n\r\nthe  employer  seeking to get what he  considers\r\n\r\nadequate representation for himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid, in\r\n\r\nthe  course of the debate, we would be teaching\r\n\r\nothers!  As the definition of \"officer\" appears\r\n\r\nin  clause  62  (2)  (a),  you  will  see  that\r\n\r\nrepresentation is restricted to persons in  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  a trade union  as  a  full-time\r\n\r\nsecretary or assistant secretary. We felt  that\r\n\r\nthat  was unduly restrictive against the unions\r\n\r\nas    far   as   representations   before   the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court were concerned. You will  see\r\n\r\nin clause 62 (1) (b) (ii) that employers can be\r\n\r\nrepresented by officers of their trade  unions.\r\n\r\nI  have  mentioned  this  before:  although  an\r\n\r\nemployer is not a party to the proceedings,  an\r\n\r\nemployer  may  nevertheless be a  member  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade union. For the purpose of representation,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  an  employer can make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nservices of an officer who is employed  by  his\r\n\r\ntrade  union.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   the   experience  of   seeing   big\r\n\r\norganisations of employers employing specialist\r\n\r\nofficers as trade union experts. I do not  wish\r\n\r\nto mention any names to the House, but it would\r\n\r\nsound  a bell in their memory when I say  that.\r\n\r\nThe  employers  can get the services  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionists who sell their skill to the employers\r\n\r\nas  specialists. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthat,  it was considered unduly restrictive  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the representation on behalf of a  trade\r\n\r\nunion of employees to a full-time secretary  or\r\n\r\nassistant  secretary  of  a  union.  For   that\r\n\r\nreason, we have proposed this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nhas  overlooked the provisions of clause 62 (1)\r\n\r\n(b)  (ii), where it is provided that  all  paid\r\n\r\nagents  are excluded. What is a paid  agent?  A\r\n\r\npaid  agent can be an accountant or a  firm  of\r\n\r\naccountants. If we allow them to advertise  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  they  are experts  in  trade  union\r\n\r\nmatters,  they could then assist the  employer.\r\n\r\nFor  that  reason,  we have excluded  all  paid\r\n\r\nagents  from espousing the cause of  disputants\r\n\r\nbefore the Arbitration Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the clause originally stood, you will see\r\n\r\nthat  it was unduly weighted in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  and we have sought to  redress  that\r\n\r\nbalance.  That  is  why  we  have  amended  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"officer\" for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nrepresentation  to give the  committee  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunion the right to appoint any person whom they\r\n\r\nconsider competent to represent them before the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nsaid   that  the  services  of  advocates   and\r\n\r\nsolicitors are also available to trade  unions.\r\n\r\nIs  that so? Out of the whole Bar in Singapore,\r\n\r\nI know of very, very few lawyers who are really\r\n\r\ninterested  in trade union work, and  who  will\r\n\r\noffer  their  services to trade  unions  for  a\r\n\r\nnominal fee. They can be counted on your finger-tips.  As against that, the employers have  got\r\n\r\nthe services of the whole Bar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see quite clearly how everything is\r\n\r\nweighted  against the trade union of employees,\r\n\r\nand  it is for that reason that Government  has\r\n\r\nproposed  a further amendment to clause  62  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  appointment of  conciliation\r\n\r\nofficers   as  well  as  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\nOfficers, whose services will be available to a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  of  employees.  On  balance,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  Government  can   not   be\r\n\r\ncharged  with  favouring  the  trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployees at the expense of the trade union  of\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of legal representation before\r\n\r\nthe  Arbitration Court, I have repeatedly  told\r\n\r\nthis   House   that  there  is  a  very   great\r\n\r\ndifference   between  the  functions   of   the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, which we propose to set  up,\r\n\r\nand   the   ordinary  Courts.  The  Courts   of\r\n\r\nArbitration are not Courts of Judicature - I have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly said that. Their functions are  more\r\n\r\nlike  those  of bodies which concern themselves\r\n\r\nwith  delegated legislation. At  a  glance  the\r\n\r\nprocess of arbitration and conciliation is  not\r\n\r\na  judicial process. By conciliation,  a  third\r\n\r\nparty   tries  to  bring  the  two   disputants\r\n\r\ntogether, and to narrow down their differences.\r\n\r\nIt  is only when he cannot get them to reach an\r\n\r\nagreement  that  the  question  of  arbitration\r\n\r\narises.  And  when the question of  arbitration\r\n\r\narises,  it is proper, to our way of  thinking,\r\n\r\nthat there should not be a formalistic approach\r\n\r\nThe  training of lawyers is such that they  are\r\n\r\nprone  to  think  in terms of precedents;  they\r\n\r\ntend to stand on their rights. Far from helping\r\n\r\nto  bring  the  parties together, lawyers  more\r\n\r\noften than not make them drift apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose right through has been an honest\r\n\r\npurpose. We have repeatedly said that, though we  want\r\n\r\nboth  sides  to  accept  the principle  of  compulsory\r\n\r\narbitration,  it  is  our intention  that  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible they should try to reach agreement, and  that\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  last  resort,  when  agreement  is  not\r\n\r\npossible, will they submit the dispute to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThat surely is reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the intervener, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have indicated that the State Advocate-General  can\r\n\r\nbe  an  intervener  in arbitration proceedings.  There\r\n\r\nmight  be  reasons  why he should intervene.  When  he\r\n\r\ndoes,  he  would be looking to the public interest  in\r\n\r\nthat  dispute.  If he comes in, then we  have  allowed\r\n\r\nlegal  representation. It is not  true  that  we  have\r\n\r\nexcluded  all legal representation, as the  Opposition\r\n\r\nFront  Benchers have charged. If this clause is looked\r\n\r\nat carefully, it will be seen that we also allow legal\r\n\r\nrepresentation  when  the Court is  looking  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion of contempt of Court under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause 54. In the case of ordinary disputes, where  no\r\n\r\nlegal  problems  are involved, where  no  question  of\r\n\r\ncontempt is to be looked into, and where there  is  no\r\n\r\nintervention  by  the  State Advocate-General,  it  is\r\n\r\nright and proper that lawyers should not come in.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has already made the  point  that  if\r\n\r\nlawyers are interested in this kind of work, they  can\r\n\r\ngive  up  their legal practice. If they give up  their\r\n\r\npractice  six months before they get themselves  mixed\r\n\r\nup with these matters, praise be to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  just  one  little point to  add,  from  personal\r\n\r\nexperience  too.

But I would like to  say,\r\n\r\nSir, that the wording of the amendment throws the\r\n\r\ngate  wide  open. Not only does  it  make  it  an\r\n\r\noffence,  but it is also not meant  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nobjection.  If it is meant to meet the objection,\r\n\r\nI  am sure the amendment should allow for a full-time  officer, by whatever name called. He  could\r\n\r\nbe  a  clerk,  a general affairs officer,  or  he\r\n\r\ncould  be  anybody. But the amendment as proposed\r\n\r\nby  the Minister could mean anyone, it could even\r\n\r\nmean  a  Political Secretary. He  could  even  be\r\n\r\nanyone   not  connected  with  the  trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement. I think the unions' objection  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  being  tied down to the  secretary  or\r\n\r\nassistant  secretary. Why cannot it be a  general\r\n\r\naffairs  clerk?  Why cannot it be  an  organising\r\n\r\nsecretary? Why cannot it be a full-time  official\r\n\r\nwho  does  not  carry the title of  secretary  or\r\n\r\nassistant  secretary? I am  sure  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  no objection if I amend the amendment\r\n\r\nto  read,  \"full-time officer, by  whatever  name\r\n\r\ncalled\", if that is actually the intention of the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the\r\n\r\namendment  is to enable the trade unions  to  get\r\n\r\nthe   services  of  people  in  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  who are skilled in the presentation  of\r\n\r\narguments before an arbitral body. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill must realise that the purpose  of  this\r\n\r\nlegislation is to set up an industrial court, and\r\n\r\nit  would  be necessary for the unions to  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  services  of  people  who  are  skilled   in\r\n\r\npresenting  their arguments before the industrial\r\n\r\ncourt. Now one union may not have an official who\r\n\r\nis so skilled. Surely it cannot be wrong for that\r\n\r\nunion  to look around for some other union  which\r\n\r\nhas  a conciliation officer, to enable it to have\r\n\r\nan  official skilled in the type of service  that\r\n\r\nit  wants.  If  you  write into  the  clause  the\r\n\r\nprovision that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so and so is to be full-time, will you really\r\n\r\nachieve your purpose? There is nothing to prevent\r\n\r\nany union committee from deciding that X, who  is\r\n\r\na  stranger to the union, will, for the  purposes\r\n\r\nof  the  arbitration, be employed  full-time.  It\r\n\r\nmeans  nothing. It does not add anything to  what\r\n\r\nyou  are  trying to do. The mere  fact  that  you\r\n\r\nemploy a person to represent your case before the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court suggests that he  is  employed\r\n\r\nfull-time  for that purpose. Because  arbitration\r\n\r\nproceedings take a long time, they are  not  over\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of  one day. I  know  that  some\r\n\r\narbitration proceedings take as much  as  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  weeks before they are concluded. We  leave\r\n\r\nthat  latitude  to the unions.

We do not  want  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of undesirables unconnected with the trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  putting  up  notice  boards  and\r\n\r\nsaying  that  they  are,  for  the  purposes   of\r\n\r\narbitration, paid agents whose services would  be\r\n\r\nat  the  disposal  of any union  which  wants  to\r\n\r\nemploy them. That would make a farce of the whole\r\n\r\nproceedings.  You can leave the  unions  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their own affairs. We are trying our  best\r\n\r\nto develop a sense of responsibility. We think it\r\n\r\nunfair  that those persons who are in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  should spend  so  much  time  in\r\n\r\nconciliation proceedings, and when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\nthe   presentation  of  their  case  before   the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, to see lawyers coming  in  on\r\n\r\nvarious pretexts to cash in.

We  have  already   had\r\n\r\nexperience of Political Secretaries being  given\r\n\r\nleave  to  appear before a court to represent  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union. I think what the Minister actually\r\n\r\naims  at  is to see that a trade union can  have\r\n\r\nany  member of that trade union or a  member  of\r\n\r\nany  other trade union of employees to come  and\r\n\r\nhelp.  If it is limited to a member of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  or  a member of any other trade union  of\r\n\r\nemployees, then I think that could be understood\r\n\r\nby   all.  It  is  just  that  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement,  as a whole, can be depended  upon  to\r\n\r\ncome to the assistance of one union in regard to\r\n\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  is  referring to the intervention  of\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries in trade  union  affairs.\r\n\r\nMay  I remind him that the Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nhe has in mind are Political Secretaries who are\r\n\r\nalso   members  of  trade  unions?

Clause 77 deals with  the\r\n\r\ncase  where skilful employers hold out  carrots\r\n\r\nin  a general way before employees who seek  ad\r\n\r\nvancement  in  their service. In the  terms  of\r\n\r\nclause 77, an employer is committing an offence\r\n\r\nif he says to an employee:\r\n\r\n\"If  you sever your connections with the union,\r\n\r\nI  will  in due course see to it that  you  are\r\n\r\npromoted  to a superior post in my employment.\"\r\n\r\nThat sort of inducement is penalised under this\r\n\r\nprovision.

In the circumstances, where  a  go-slow  can  be  considered to be a breach  of  an\r\n\r\naward,  it will be open to the President of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  to  proceed under clause 53 of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nYou will note, Mr Speaker, Sir, that clause  53\r\n\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Court shall have power-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to order compliance with an award\r\n\r\nproved   to  have  been  broken   or   not\r\n\r\nobserved; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to enjoin a trade union or person from\r\n\r\ncommitting  or  continuing a contravention\r\n\r\nof  any provision of this Ordinance  or  a\r\n\r\nbreach or non-observance of an award.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo  that if there is any evidence that an  award\r\n\r\nis  being  disregarded, then the  Court - in  this\r\n\r\ncase  it will be the President - will summon those\r\n\r\nwho are responsible and will make the order that\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the award be  obeyed  and  be\r\n\r\ncarried   out.   If  there  is  further   wilful\r\n\r\ndisregard  of the Court's order, then the  Court\r\n\r\ncan  proceed under the provisions of clause  54.\r\n\r\nAs  you will see, under the provisions of clause\r\n\r\n54,  the  Court can fine the unions and  it  can\r\n\r\nalso  place  the leaders of the  union  who  are\r\n\r\nresponsible    for   these   activities    under\r\n\r\nrestriction  against  participation   in   union\r\n\r\nactivities for a period of up to two  years.

Sir, the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that what the Government aims at achieving\r\n\r\nby this Bill is industrial stability, industrial\r\n\r\npeace and confidence. This particular clause has\r\n\r\nbeen inserted by the Government, and because  it\r\n\r\nhas   been  inserted,  those  people  who   have\r\n\r\nsuffered   the  disadvantage  of   the   go-slow\r\n\r\npolicies of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  trade  unions in the past are relieved  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that  the  Government is  aware  of  this\r\n\r\nindustrial pest in their midst and is  making  a\r\n\r\ngenuine and honest effort to see to it that this\r\n\r\nindustrial  pest shall not  rear  its  head\r\n\r\nagain.  I do not see any reason why this  clause\r\n\r\nshould  be  deleted when it is in  regard  to  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of an award. If there has been no award,\r\n\r\nit  is  a different matter. The trade union  can\r\n\r\ntake  whatever  action it desires  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  its  aims to improve the conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment of its members. But once an award has\r\n\r\nbeen  given by the Court of Arbitration to which\r\n\r\nthat  trade  union is a party, surely,  for  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of the parties in the Court,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  any attempt to  advise  persons\r\n\r\nfound by the Court not to be observing the award\r\n\r\nshould be punishable. If the Government had  not\r\n\r\ninserted  this  clause in, one could  understand\r\n\r\nwhy they had felt that it was not necessary. But\r\n\r\nafter  having  put  it in  in  order  to  instil\r\n\r\nconfidence in the public, to withdraw it at this\r\n\r\njuncture is going to shake the public's  feeling\r\n\r\nof confidence in the Government's aim to achieve\r\n\r\nindustrial stability and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsorry  that  the  confidence of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has been badly shaken and that he  was\r\n\r\nmisled   during  the  Second  Reading.   To   my\r\n\r\nrecollection,  Sir, notice of  these  amendments\r\n\r\nwas  given  before the Second  Reading.  If  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  leaders subsequently  chose  to  say\r\n\r\nthat,  at the time when they were commenting  on\r\n\r\nthe principle of the Bill, they were unaware  of\r\n\r\nthe position of the Government, that surely is a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  regret that they did not  give  the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper and the Notices of Amendments to the\r\n\r\nBill the consideration which they warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into the rather long-winded argument as to how confidence was first\r\n\r\ncreated  and  then shaken by the  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nthis  clause.  All I want to do  is  to  explain\r\n\r\nbriefly  why  we  accepted  the  arguments   put\r\n\r\nforward by a committee consisting of many  union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, to delete clauses 82 and 83\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principles on which this Bill was\r\n\r\nbased is a balance of interests and balance  of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, duties and punishments. There\r\n\r\nis already sufficient power under clause 54 for\r\n\r\nthe  Court to see that its awards are honoured.\r\n\r\nand to impose penalties on the unions and union\r\n\r\nleaders  if  the terms of an award were  to  be\r\n\r\nflouted.  Clauses  82 and 83 deal  specifically\r\n\r\nonly  with unions of employees, because it  did\r\n\r\nnot  occur to the human mind that employers can\r\n\r\ngo-slow.  Employers  either  lock-out  or  they\r\n\r\nclose  down  altogether. Therefore, the  unions\r\n\r\nargued  that clauses 82 and 83 were, in effect,\r\n\r\nan  extra  penalty  against  unions  for  being\r\n\r\nunions. I would just like to point this out  to\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the other side - that,  as  drafted,\r\n\r\nclauses 54 and 55 can adequately deal with  the\r\n\r\nsituation where union officers are flouting the\r\n\r\nterms  of  an award by going slow. I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  that  the Member for Farrer Park,  if  he\r\n\r\napplies himself to the wording of clause 54  as\r\n\r\nnow  amended - penalties on trade  union  leaders\r\n\r\nfor  flouting  an order for compliance  by  the\r\n\r\nCourt - will  see that there is sufficient  scope\r\n\r\nthere  to  ensure compliance by punishment,  if\r\n\r\ncompliance is, in fact, negatived by a go-slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But, Sir, the punishment is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  meted out to those  persons  who\r\n\r\nlisten to the agitator coming along and saying,\r\n\r\n\"You  should not do this and you should not  do\r\n\r\nthat.\"  It  is not the agitator only  who  will\r\n\r\nhimself  be punished, but also the persons  who\r\n\r\nare  foolish  enough to listen to him  will  be\r\n\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  I  think,  has  paid  very   little\r\n\r\nattention to what I have just said. I draw  his\r\n\r\nattention to the provisions of clause 53.  When\r\n\r\nthere  is  evidence  that  an  award  is  being\r\n\r\ndisregarded, what the Court would do is to send\r\n\r\nfor   - in   the  case  of  a  trade  union   of\r\n\r\nemployees - the  leaders of the trade  union  who\r\n\r\nthe Court thinks are responsible for the breach\r\n\r\nof  the award. It would then take evidence, and\r\n\r\nif  it  was satisfied that there was  a  wilful\r\n\r\ndisregard of the award, it could make an  order\r\n\r\nthat  the terms of the award be carried out  by\r\n\r\nthe   union  of  employees.  If  there  was   a\r\n\r\ndisregard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  order  of the Court, then the Court  could\r\n\r\nproceed to punish as in clause 54, that is,  to\r\n\r\nfine   and  to  place  the  leaders   under   a\r\n\r\nrestriction. The persons who would be bound  by\r\n\r\nthe order of the Court would be the persons who\r\n\r\nwere  summoned before the Court  and  who  were\r\n\r\nordered by the Court specifically to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  the award. That  order  clearly\r\n\r\nwould  not apply to the other committee members\r\n\r\nof the union who knew nothing about the matter.\r\n\r\nSo  I  cannot see the point of what the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill has just said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does not clause\r\n\r\n82  take  in the person who goes and encourages\r\n\r\nthem  to  go  slow? Clause 54 only  deals  with\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the union who do not comply  with\r\n\r\nthe award. I think the gentleman who should  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with more severely is the gentleman  who\r\n\r\nis outside the union but goes along and incites\r\n\r\nthem to go slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are\r\n\r\nnow  delving  into niceties and intricacies.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  by implication admitted  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  that  the  powers  of  enforcement  are\r\n\r\nthere,  and that is basically what we  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve. If by the deletion of clauses  82  and\r\n\r\n83  we  deprive  the Court  of  the  powers  of\r\n\r\nenforcement, then I would say we are  departing\r\n\r\nfrom  a  point of major principle. By  debating\r\n\r\nwhether or not we should so draft the clause as\r\n\r\nto  get  the man who may not have been  brought\r\n\r\nbefore the Court, who has incited them, and who\r\n\r\nis  not an officer of the union, then I say, by\r\n\r\nimplication,  it  is admitted  that  there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient powers in clauses 53, 54 and  55  to\r\n\r\ncompel  compliance. That basically is  what  we\r\n\r\nintended to do. The reason why clauses  82  and\r\n\r\n83  were agreed to be deleted from the Bill was\r\n\r\nthat   there  was  no  similar  provision   for\r\n\r\nemployers  because, by the  nature  of  things,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  go  slow but the  employees  can.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  having to hold the  scales  against\r\n\r\ncompeting  interests, we decided,  since  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  competing interest on the  other  side\r\n\r\nwhich   would  merit  similar  or  commensurate\r\n\r\npunishment, to delete clauses 82 and 83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\ninformation.

It has got nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  collective  agreements  as  such  or  the\r\n\r\ncourse    of    arbitration.

They are slightly\r\n\r\ndistinct.  Clause  82 deals  specifically  with\r\n\r\nsituations where there is a go-slow. Clause  54\r\n\r\ndeals  with  general situations. Unlike  clause\r\n\r\n82,  a  person to be punished under  clause  54\r\n\r\nmust  be  a member of a trade union of  persons\r\n\r\nthat  is  continuing  a  contravention  of  any\r\n\r\nprovision  of  this Ordinance, or committing  a\r\n\r\nbreach of non-observance of an award. If one of\r\n\r\nthe ways in which an award is being defeated is\r\n\r\nby  a  go-slow,  then  the  officers  who  have\r\n\r\nincited the go-slow, the leaders and maybe some\r\n\r\nof  the men, or the shop stewards may be called\r\n\r\nup  before  the Court and warned in the,  first\r\n\r\ninstance.  Subsequently, if there is a  breach,\r\n\r\nthen clause 54 springs into operation and there\r\n\r\nis  contempt  of court, and the penalties  come\r\n\r\ninto  being.  All  that I wanted  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Members of the  House  to  is\r\n\r\nthis,  that  if it is complained  that  by  the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of  this clause 82 we are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmaking  awards unenforceable because the unions\r\n\r\ncan flout them by going slow, then I accept the\r\n\r\nstricture that they have passed. But if  it  is\r\n\r\nconceded that all that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  is to hold the balance  between\r\n\r\nunions  and  employers  by  not  putting  in  a\r\n\r\nspecial provision for the-punishment of  unions\r\n\r\nfor going slow, when we cannot put in a similar\r\n\r\nprovision  for  punishing employers  for  going\r\n\r\nslow,  then I say there is no point in carrying\r\n\r\nthis debate any further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to\r\n\r\nwhat the Prime Minister has just said, I should\r\n\r\nlike   to   draw  a  distinction  between   the\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  clause 82 and the  procedure  in\r\n\r\nclauses  53 and 54. You will see, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the punishment for go-slow  is  the\r\n\r\npunishment (as clause 82 stands) which is meted\r\n\r\nout  by  the ordinary Court - the District Court.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our  view that this sort of  punishment\r\n\r\nshould be handled by the Court which makes  the\r\n\r\naward.  But  under the procedure in clauses  53\r\n\r\nand  54,  it is the Court of Arbitration  which\r\n\r\nmakes  the award and which also supervises  the\r\n\r\nexecution or the carrying out of that award. If\r\n\r\nthere is to be a punishment, it is but fair (if\r\n\r\nthe  punishment is to be meted out on a  charge\r\n\r\nthat  the  award is wilfully disregarded)  that\r\n\r\nthe power to inflict that punishment should  be\r\n\r\nin  the  hands  of  the Court which  makes  the\r\n\r\naward.  If  you  bring it before  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nCourts,   they   may  not  be  aware   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  which led to the award,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  unduly penalising the  unions  if  we\r\n\r\nallow this clause to stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker.

Since he  would\r\n\r\nnot be deemed to be a public servant, the argument\r\n\r\nwas  that he might continue to be a Member of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I had not paid sufficient attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  formula used, but I have since inquired  from\r\n\r\nthe  legal draftsman, and I am informed  that  the\r\n\r\nway  in  which it was drafted would make it  quite\r\n\r\nclear that if a Member of this Assembly should  be\r\n\r\nappointed to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npost  of  President,  then he would  automatically\r\n\r\nvacate  his  seat  as a Member  of  the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nFurther, the reason for the emphasis that he shall\r\n\r\nnot be deemed to be a public servant is to take it\r\n\r\nout  of  the Public Service Commission. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthere would be considerable argument as to whether\r\n\r\nor  not  the appointment to this office is covered\r\n\r\nby  the  general  provisions in  the  Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich require all public officers to go before the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the only point\r\n\r\nwhich  troubled  me  about this  clause  was  that\r\n\r\nanybody  who is in Government service is a  public\r\n\r\nofficer. Anybody who is paid from the funds of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  a  public officer.  If  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister assures the House that from that point of\r\n\r\nview  the President of the Court will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  public  officer just like  the  High  Court\r\n\r\nJudges  (High Court Judges are not public officers\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes of only a certain part  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  but  in respect of  other  matters,\r\n\r\nthey  continue to be public officers) and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment say that that is the intention and that\r\n\r\nthey  will  carry  it  out, then  I  have  nothing\r\n\r\nfurther to add. That is the only difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer   Park   has,  I  think,   overlooked   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Constitution,  where  \"public\r\n\r\nservice\"  includes  \"service ... after   the\r\n\r\nappointed  day ... under the Government of Singapore,\r\n\r\nor  service as a Judge of the Supreme Court.\"  The\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Constitution lay down  that  all\r\n\r\npublic  offices must be filled through recruitment\r\n\r\nthrough the Public Service Commission. It is  only\r\n\r\nfor  that  purpose that the Judges of the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  are  deemed not to hold public office.  But\r\n\r\nthey are in the public service. We have got to  so\r\n\r\nprovide  that  the  President of  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  is not deemed to be a public servant if  we\r\n\r\nwant   to   shut   out  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution   with  regard  to  his  recruitment;\r\n\r\nbecause  clause  3 (1) of the Bill  indicates  the\r\n\r\nmanner  of  his recruitment, that is, he  will  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  after\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the Prime  Minister.  To  give\r\n\r\neffect to that intention, we have had to use these\r\n\r\nwords, that he \"shall not be deemed to be a public\r\n\r\nservant\". That is all there is to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law  would  not  try  and  pooh-pooh   my\r\n\r\nobjection, it is a very genuine objection  that  I  am\r\n\r\ntaking. According to the Constitution, a Judge is  not\r\n\r\na  public servant for the purposes of Part IX  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  In  every other part  he  is  a  public\r\n\r\nservant and in the public service. Section 75  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except for the purposes of sections 83, 84 and 85 of\r\n\r\nthis  Order,  and  except where the context  otherwise\r\n\r\nrequires, in the interpretation of this Part  of  this\r\n\r\nOrder-\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is Part IX. In so far as this Part is concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  office  of  a  Judge  of  the  Supreme  Court  is\r\n\r\nexcluded,  merely because that appointment should  not\r\n\r\ngo  to the Public Service Commission. It is only  from\r\n\r\nthat  point of view. But as drafted in this  Bill,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear that for all purposes he is not a public\r\n\r\nservant. Section 42 of the Constitution says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) Every Member of the Assembly shall cease to be a\r\n\r\nMember  at the next dissolution of the Assembly  after\r\n\r\nhe has been elected, or previously thereto if his seat\r\n\r\nbecomes vacant under the provisions of this Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The seat of a Member shall become vacant -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if he is appointed to or to act in any public\r\n\r\noffice;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this section, Sir, if a Member of this House\r\n\r\nwere  appointed  to  the post of  President  of'  this\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, then he would have  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nAssembly: but with clause 4 as it stands, I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat he need not have to resign his seat. That is as I\r\n\r\nread it, Sir, If my reading of that is incorrect,  let\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law say it.  If  he  will\r\n\r\nassure  the  House that that was not the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and that the Government  will  not  do\r\n\r\nthat,  then  I am satisfied, But I do not want  to  be\r\n\r\nmade a fool of by the Minister for Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What I have indicated to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park is that the legal  draftsman,\r\n\r\nwho  is  an expert in these matters, and on  whom  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must rely, has given us the assurance  that\r\n\r\nthe  clause, as drafted, would automatically cause any\r\n\r\nMember  of the Assembly to resign his seat if he  were\r\n\r\nappointed.

Some\r\n\r\nof   our   financial  institutions  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially foreign incorporated institutions, hold\r\n\r\na fairly high proportion of their assets overseas.\r\n\r\nFor  example, banking statistics for  the  quarter\r\n\r\nending September, 1959, show that the net overseas\r\n\r\nassets of commercial banks in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  $410.5 million, or nearly  25  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the total assets of $1,693 million. These\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions have, in  the  past,  been\r\n\r\nable   to  claim  that  they  hold  such  a   high\r\n\r\nproportion  of their assets overseas by necessity,\r\n\r\nthat  there are insufficient opportunities locally\r\n\r\nto  invest their surplus funds in short or  medium\r\n\r\nterm liquid and safe or gilt-edged securities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, it is the intention of the\r\n\r\nTreasury that a variety of such securities  should\r\n\r\nbe   available  to  investors,  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nlooking   for  short  term,  medium  or  long-term\r\n\r\ninvestments. Treasury deposit receipts should meet\r\n\r\nthese  investment criteria and enable institutions\r\n\r\nto  divert  their surplus funds invested  overseas\r\n\r\nfor  depositing  locally in such receipts.  By  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  they are killing two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nThese  receipts  earn interest for the  depositors\r\n\r\nand  at  least as an interim measure until longer-term monies are obtained, they also make available\r\n\r\nfunds for the economic development of the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> There are two points, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, which strike me on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point, Sir, is that the Bill enables\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to fix the rates of interest and  as\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr  Speaker, know, once the Minister  fixes\r\n\r\nthe   rates  of  interest,  then  this  House   is\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  the  payment  of  those  rates   of\r\n\r\ninterest  under  the Constitution and  nobody  can\r\n\r\nquery    their   payment.   In   the    particular\r\n\r\ncircumstances of this Bill, could the Minister say\r\n\r\nwhether it would be desirable to consult the House\r\n\r\nbefore  he fixes the rates of interest or  whether\r\n\r\nthe  nature  of the transaction is  such  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be undesirable to consult the House on  the\r\n\r\nfixing of the rates of interest?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is under clause 8 (1) of the\r\n\r\nBill, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A Treasury Deposit shall be repaid on maturity\r\n\r\nto the holder of the Treasury Deposit Receipt...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And clause 8 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No Treasury Deposit shall be repaid except upon\r\n\r\nthe  surrender  of  the Treasury  Deposit  Receipt\r\n\r\nrelating  to  such  deposit to  the  Treasury  for\r\n\r\ncancellation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  would  happen to such a receipt if  it  were\r\n\r\nlost?

During  the\r\n\r\nbudget  session of this Assembly, I  outlined  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plans to deal with the first half  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem.  The  Bill before  the  Assembly  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to establish the machinery by which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  hopes  to implement  its  policies  to\r\n\r\ntackle the second half of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, the running of adult\r\n\r\neducation classes has been largely the work of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Council  for Adult  Education,  a  body\r\n\r\nestablished in 1950, which received exemption from\r\n\r\nregistration  under the Societies  Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil   received  an  annual  grant   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  in recent  years  amounted  to\r\n\r\n$500,000.  Its  work has been  satisfactory  in  a\r\n\r\nlimited  way. But as I told the Annual  Conference\r\n\r\nof the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  Adult Education held last  December,\r\n\r\nprivate and voluntary agencies, which in the  past\r\n\r\nhad  catered to the needs of education, health and\r\n\r\nsocial services of all kinds, have today given way\r\n\r\nto  much wider and more extensive state enterprise\r\n\r\nin  these fields, not only in Singapore,  but  all\r\n\r\nover the world. Clearly, state enterprise in these\r\n\r\nfields   is   essential   if   the   benefits   of\r\n\r\ncivilisation  and of knowledge are  to  reach  the\r\n\r\ngreatest number of people in the shortest possible\r\n\r\ntime.  The time has now come in Singapore for  the\r\n\r\nState  to  assume  full responsibility  for  adult\r\n\r\neducation.  This must be regarded as an inevitable\r\n\r\ndevelopment, if adult education in our society  is\r\n\r\nto  attain yet greater heights. A country  engaged\r\n\r\nin  the  task  of nation building must  rally  all\r\n\r\nforces  which  can assist in this work  under  one\r\n\r\nbanner,  so that there can be proper direction  of\r\n\r\npolicies  and utilisation of limited resources  of\r\n\r\nfinance and manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the Assembly is designed to set\r\n\r\nup  a corporate body on which there will be strong\r\n\r\nGovernment  representation  and  which  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill is designed to establish\r\n\r\nthe  Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, which  will\r\n\r\nbe  a corporate body to promote adult education in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Discussions have taken\r\n\r\nplace   with  the  Singapore  Council  for   Adult\r\n\r\nEducation,  and the Council passed  the  following\r\n\r\nresolution  at  its  38th  Meeting  held  on  23rd\r\n\r\nDecember 1959:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council for Adult Education\r\n\r\nresolves to dissolve itself on 1st March 1960, and\r\n\r\nhand  over  its assets to the new Statutory  Board\r\n\r\nfor  Adult Education to be appointed in  1960.

It is not intended  that\r\n\r\nthe  Board  should  engage  in  any  political  or\r\n\r\nreligious  activities, but the Board will  not  be\r\n\r\nprecluded  from  organising  classes,  talks   and\r\n\r\ndebates pertaining to politics or religion if this\r\n\r\nis  considered  desirable in the public  interest.\r\n\r\nClause 11 is to ensure this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not involve the expenditure of\r\n\r\nadditional public money, there being provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  1960 Estimates for half a million dollars for\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of adult education. It is pertinent\r\n\r\nto mention here that in the 1959 grant of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf a million dollars, the Singapore Council  for\r\n\r\nAdult Education were conducting 549 classes with a\r\n\r\nstudent  enrolment of 15,947. With the  absorption\r\n\r\nof  these  classes by Government  this  year, the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of adult classes now  conducted  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  is 1,088 with a student population  of\r\n\r\nnearly  37,000.  In  other  words,  Government  is\r\n\r\nalready   doing  twice  as  much  work  in   adult\r\n\r\neducation than before on the same budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creation of the new Board, it is\r\n\r\nintended  that adult education will be brought  to\r\n\r\nthe  masses  not  only in the City  areas  but  to\r\n\r\nkampong  folk in rural areas as well. I  wish  to.\r\n\r\nannounce  that  although it was  originally  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  the bulk of literacy classes would be  borne\r\n\r\nby  teachers  doing  the extra half  session  work\r\n\r\ngratis,  it has now been decided that with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom Monday, 15th February, 1960, all teachers who\r\n\r\nare required to do extra half session work outside\r\n\r\nof  their normal schools either in the day  or  in\r\n\r\nthe  night  would be eligible for a  flat  $2  per\r\n\r\nsession   for   transport   and/or   out-of-pocket\r\n\r\nexpenses.  This will work out at roughly  $25  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  As there are about 3,000 teachers involved\r\n\r\nso far, 1,000 for night sessions and 2,000 for day\r\n\r\nsessions, the total cost is estimated at  $750,000\r\n\r\nper annum. Since no provision was made for this in\r\n\r\nthe  1960  Estimates, it will mean that  this  sum\r\n\r\nwill have to come out of the Education Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, and therefore the loss of four  primary\r\n\r\nschools  for  1961.  Needless  to  say,  the   201\r\n\r\nvoluntary  teachers from the Police Force  in  our\r\n\r\nadult  classes  will  also  be  eligible  for  the\r\n\r\nallowance mentioned above. It would not be fair to\r\n\r\nleave  them out of the scheme of things or for  us\r\n\r\nto  take  advantage of their inspiring example  to\r\n\r\noffer  their  voluntary services in teaching  work\r\n\r\nwhich   is  outside  the  scope  of  their  normal\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning at this stage, Sir, that\r\n\r\nundue  publicity given to the so-called strain  on\r\n\r\nteachers in respect of extra session work  is  not\r\n\r\njustified.  In  1959,  1,017  teachers   obtained.\r\n\r\npermission to do additional paid employment, which\r\n\r\nwas  then  limited to six hours per week.  Despite\r\n\r\nthe imposition of extra session work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  year,  up  to  date  we  have  in  hand  122\r\n\r\napplications (29 from the English stream, 38  from\r\n\r\nthe  Malay stream and 55 from the Chinese  stream)\r\n\r\nfor  additional  paid employment,  also  with  the\r\n\r\nlimit  of  six hours per week, which  we  are  now\r\n\r\nconsidering. We are expecting more applications to\r\n\r\ncome, which will be duly considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is confident that the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the Lembaga  Gerakan  Pelajaran\r\n\r\nDewasa will bring about a co-ordination and  unity\r\n\r\nof  effort towards early attainment of the  object\r\n\r\nof   universal  literacy  in  Singapore.  May  the\r\n\r\nilliterate  half  million,  or  one-third  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  be  wiped out so that  suspicion  and\r\n\r\nfear  will  be banished, and in their  place  will\r\n\r\ncome a true understanding and appreciation of  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic system based on adult franchise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the history\r\n\r\nof  education in Singapore and Malaya  shows  that\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise has very often played  a  very\r\n\r\ngreat part in starting endeavours in new fields of\r\n\r\neducation,  and that the State comes  in  to  give\r\n\r\nencouragement and help and gradually more and more\r\n\r\nhelp.  Naturally,  Sir, as the one  who  pays  the\r\n\r\npiper,  Government  wants to have  more  and  more\r\n\r\ncontrol. It is only natural. However, we must  not\r\n\r\nforget that too much control can deaden the spirit\r\n\r\nof the individual, so that if he has a new idea he\r\n\r\nmay  not be able freely to express that idea to  a\r\n\r\nsuperior officer, or even if he expresses the idea\r\n\r\nfreely the officer may not be receptive enough  to\r\n\r\nbe willing to accept that suggestion and that idea\r\n\r\nbecomes still-born.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Education himself has\r\n\r\nhad  experience  sitting in  the  Council  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity as an unofficial member. He  must  have\r\n\r\nseen how Government official nominees were working\r\n\r\nunder  a  great  handicap,  and  that  very  often\r\n\r\nrevolutionary suggestions had to come  from  these\r\n\r\nso-called unofficial nominees. Therefore, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nfelt when we read the Bill that the composition of\r\n\r\nthe Board is too heavily weighted on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nside of Government appointees. Even in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  members  who  represent  the  University   of\r\n\r\nNanyang and the University of Malaya, they are  to\r\n\r\nbe  appointed  by  the  Minister  from  among  the\r\n\r\ntutorial staff of these institutions. It does  not\r\n\r\nsay  here that the members are to be appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister on the nomination of the University.\r\n\r\nThe  public  will thus think that those  appointed\r\n\r\nare  just  part  of the Government  rubber  stamp.\r\n\r\nThat,  Sir,  would make the Board less respectable\r\n\r\nin appearance in the eyes of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>   [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel, Sir, that in order that the Board might\r\n\r\nhave  the support of all those interested in adult\r\n\r\neducation and are willing to help in it, it should\r\n\r\nbe  so composed that at least half the members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board  should  be freely elected  by  outside\r\n\r\norganisations  interested  in  the   project.   My\r\n\r\nsuggestion  would be along these lines:  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education could appoint the first two\r\n\r\nmembers,  and the various Ministers could  appoint\r\n\r\nas  stated  here,  one each. In the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College, if it is regarded as a\r\n\r\npurely  Government  institution,  of  course   the\r\n\r\nappointment  may have to be made by the  Minister.\r\n\r\nBut  if  it  is regarded as not quite a Government\r\n\r\ndepartment,  then  the  tutorial  staff  could  be\r\n\r\nallowed   to  nominate  and  the  Minister   could\r\n\r\nappoint.  But  in the case of representation  from\r\n\r\nthe  University of Malaya, the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nand  the Trades Union Congress, I definitely think\r\n\r\nthat nominations should come from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice there is no reference made to\r\n\r\nunions,  such as the Singapore Teachers' Union.  I\r\n\r\ntake  it  that  it  is  implied  that  the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nrepresentation   should   include   a    teachers'\r\n\r\nrepresentative.  But  unless specified,  it  could\r\n\r\nwell mean that in the operation of this Bill,  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. might not want to appoint teachers who  are\r\n\r\nrespected  or  who  have  the  support   of   the\r\n\r\nTeachers'   Union.  In  that  case   then,   those\r\n\r\nrepresentatives will not be able to  give  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard the views of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe teaching body in Singapore. We believe that if\r\n\r\nadult  education classes are to function properly,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  who have to play a  most  important\r\n\r\npart  should have a say, a good say, in the Board.\r\n\r\nSo if the Teachers' Union or any national union of\r\n\r\nteachers  recognised by the teachers in  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  represented, then, Sir, the Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe  Board would not be able to hear what goes  on\r\n\r\nat the ground level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the greatest admiration for the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his great energy. I know  he  works\r\n\r\nlong hours: but not all people can work as hard as\r\n\r\nhe  does. It has now come into the open that  many\r\n\r\nteachers  cannot  stand the  strain.  The  Chinese\r\n\r\nSchools' Conference apparently held a meeting  and\r\n\r\nthey wished to petition the Minister to allow them\r\n\r\nto invite donations from parents to enable them to\r\n\r\nsecure  the services of those unemployed  teachers\r\n\r\nto  teach  and thereby prevent some of  them  from\r\n\r\nhaving   a   breakdown.  Sir,  this  is   not   an\r\n\r\nexaggeration. We have lost teachers  who,  because\r\n\r\nthey cannot stand the strain, in addition to a six-day  week,  of having to teach in adult  education\r\n\r\nclasses, have tendered their resignations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the Minister's offer to pay transport\r\n\r\nexpenses  to  those teachers who  teach  in  these\r\n\r\nevening classes. But we would be glad also  if  he\r\n\r\ncould  give an assurance that there should  be  no\r\n\r\ncompulsion in the case of those teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to bear the strain, and on medical grounds\r\n\r\nask  to be excused from performing the extra hours\r\n\r\nper week. Sir, in implementing the principle which\r\n\r\nhe  has  stated,  maybe  not  in  this  House  but\r\n\r\noutside,  that these 4\ufffd hours include  extra-mural\r\n\r\nduties,  sometimes  one  branch  official  or  one\r\n\r\nofficial in one section, not knowing the needs  of\r\n\r\nanother branch, allocates to certain teachers  the\r\n\r\nfull quota. If these teachers are already involved\r\n\r\nin  important  duties  in organisations  like  the\r\n\r\nscouts  organisation, then they find they  are  on\r\n\r\nthe  horns of a dilemma. If they do the 4\ufffd  hours,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to give up their duties in the  scouts\r\n\r\norganisation. If they do not do the 4\ufffd hours, they\r\n\r\nwould be regarded as negligent or showing a spirit\r\n\r\nof  insubordination. The result, Sir, is  that  in\r\n\r\nsports work in the schools these teachers have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  been able to find the time. We are told  that\r\n\r\nfor  certain sports activities, they could  deduct\r\n\r\none  hour;  so  the head masters in  one  district\r\n\r\nstudying the question say, \"It is impossible.\" Let\r\n\r\nus  take  the case of football and ask the teacher\r\n\r\nto  devote that one-hour per week to it.  But  the\r\n\r\npreparation  and training of the students,  taking\r\n\r\nthem  out to the match, watching them through  the\r\n\r\nmatch,  and after that again giving them  tips  on\r\n\r\nhow  they could improve themselves, take more than\r\n\r\none  hour a week. I hope the Minister will go into\r\n\r\nthe  details if they are asking too much, but this\r\n\r\nis one of the causes which have made many teachers\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the burden is becoming too  great  for\r\n\r\nthem.  I would not say all of them, because  there\r\n\r\nare  some  of us who, for the sake of the country,\r\n\r\nare  willing to work all out. But there  are  many\r\n\r\nwho  definitely  cannot stand the strain.  If  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Union  were  well  represented,   those\r\n\r\nmembers on the Board could express their views and\r\n\r\nbe  able  to plan a programme so that the teachers\r\n\r\nwho  do teach in these classes will be able to  do\r\n\r\nso   physically  fit  and  also,  you  might  say,\r\n\r\nemotionally at one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what\r\n\r\nviews to express to the Minister concerned.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  bring allegations.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to be accused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study this Bill, in my opinion, it can be\r\n\r\nsaid  to  be  discriminatory. The  composition  of\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board provided in this Bill is  not\r\n\r\nreasonable.  However,  I hope  there  will  be  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  the Minister  for  Education  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  this  point, which I  think,  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant. I believe this is not the way to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  unity  or  to achieve the building  of  one\r\n\r\nnation,  one language, one State, because  in  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill there are bound to be slip-ups or oversights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay Education Council has not been\r\n\r\nmentioned anywhere in the Bill at all, if we  want\r\n\r\nto educate half a million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  population who are illiterate, I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  a  representative  of  the  Malay  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil  should sit on the Board. He  can  express\r\n\r\nhis views and work together with other members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board. There is in the Bill opportunity given\r\n\r\nto  the Trades Union Congress representation,  but\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity is denied to the Malay  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been  announced  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  this afternoon that a  fee  of  $2  per\r\n\r\nsession  will  be  paid to those  who  work  extra\r\n\r\nhours, and also to members of the Police Force who\r\n\r\nhave volunteered to teach in night classes. It  is\r\n\r\nproper  that the fees be paid to them, because  of\r\n\r\nall  the  trouble they take. However, I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education would  consider  such\r\n\r\npayments  retrospective  to  the  time  the  extra\r\n\r\nsessions  began.  It will then show  the  definite\r\n\r\nstand of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I neither wish to support the previous-Government nor pay tribute to the present\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but I feel that it is-not  surprising\r\n\r\nthat  being a self-governing State, we should  all\r\n\r\nwork  and  achieve results two-fold.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education or the Board will work  even\r\n\r\nharder  than those in the past. But I do not  mean\r\n\r\nto  say that I do not agree with the work that has\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out by Government. We should  adopt\r\n\r\nthe motto \"Talk less, work more\".

T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nfrom  the 1st of March 1960, the Singapore Council\r\n\r\nfor  Adult  Education will cease to exist,  and  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board will be set up to take  over  the\r\n\r\nassets  and  property  and the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  consequently. While  realising  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  achievements of the Council  for  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation cannot and should not be measured with a\r\n\r\nyardstick  with  what similar  organisations  have\r\n\r\ndone  elsewhere in their work, it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nstate  that the scope and extent of its  functions\r\n\r\nhave  been  limited. It is a  fact,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nstressed  by those responsible for adult education\r\n\r\nhereto,  that  lack  of funds  had  prevented  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  other  voluntary organisations  from\r\n\r\nmaking  the  literacy campaign large and  wide  to\r\n\r\nextend  to all organisations and institutions  for\r\n\r\nthe  masses,  to  provide adequate facilities  and\r\n\r\nconditions for the requirements and furtherance of\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the educationally under-privileged.\r\n\r\nThis has been one of the factors, and perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmost  important factor. But apart from this,  lack\r\n\r\nof  self-sacrifice for the organising and teaching\r\n\r\nof  literary classes has also contributed  to  the\r\n\r\nlimitation.  Aided  by  an indifferent  Government\r\n\r\nwith  an  incompetent Minister whose interest  lay\r\n\r\nelsewhere, perhaps far, far away in the tin  mines\r\n\r\nof Perak, this made matters much worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council, gathering from its final report,\r\n\r\nhad roughly on the 30th September, 1959, just over\r\n\r\n560  basic  literacy classes. They were  known  as\r\n\r\nbasic  education classes with student strength  of\r\n\r\nabout  15,000. In any case, not more than  17,000.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  an  island  of one and  a  half  million\r\n\r\npeople,  where  roughly  about  50  per  cent  are\r\n\r\nadults, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevident  that  this  student  strength  does   not\r\n\r\nrepresent   even  a  sizeable  proportion.   These\r\n\r\nfigures  are  what were officially  known  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  and they therefore appear in the records.\r\n\r\nBut  it has been clearly known to people who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  associated  with  adult  classes,  in  their\r\n\r\norganisation and function, that in numerous  cases\r\n\r\nthe  strength of the classes was not what  it  was\r\n\r\nrecorded  to  be. For example, if the teacher  had\r\n\r\nabout  10  regular  students  in  his  class,  his\r\n\r\nregister  had  been  found  to  show  an   average\r\n\r\nattendance of about 30 students. I do not say that\r\n\r\nthat  was the case with all teachers in all  adult\r\n\r\neducation classes. But there have been cases.  The\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  this is clear.  If - and  we  know\r\n\r\nthat - teachers were paid $7.50 per hour,  and  they\r\n\r\ntaught  a  class with a minimum number of students\r\n\r\nas  stipulated  by  the Council or  its  affiliate\r\n\r\norganisations, it became imperative that they,  at\r\n\r\nleast on paper, had to maintain a class above  the\r\n\r\nminimum  strength required, otherwise  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  to lose their $7.50 as their class might  be\r\n\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further elaborate on this, I must say that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Ad  hoc  Committee on  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nappointed by the Ministry took over the management\r\n\r\nof the S.C.A. night classes, it was found in quite\r\n\r\na  few  cases  that the student strength  was  far\r\n\r\nbelow what it was officially recorded to be.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is no need for me to explain in great detail\r\n\r\nwhy  it  is necessary for the Government  to  take\r\n\r\nover   and  unify  the  running  of  the  literacy\r\n\r\nclasses,  because I am sure that  the  Government,\r\n\r\nparticularly   the  Ministry  of  Education,   has\r\n\r\nexpounded on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will suffice if I say that if we are\r\n\r\nseriously  to put into effect the drive  for  mass\r\n\r\neducation and mass literacy, then it is absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary that the planning, the organisation  and\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of these classes must not  and\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  entirely left  in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nvoluntary  organisations. This does not mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not recognise  the  valuable\r\n\r\nwork  that  has been initiated and  done  by  such\r\n\r\norganisations. What I do mean is that, in addition\r\n\r\nto unifying the system of teaching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadults,   it  is  necessary  to  have  the   whole\r\n\r\nmachinery   of   the  State  fully   backing   the\r\n\r\nobjectives.  Just now, when the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  was  speaking, I gathered the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  he was afraid that if the Government  is  to\r\n\r\ntake  over  the running of these classes,  it  may\r\n\r\nlimit the scope of spreading literacy, and tie the\r\n\r\nhands  of  people  who  are  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the literacy classes. But,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  to  the  contrary. If you  want  the  night\r\n\r\nclasses  to be effective, if you want our campaign\r\n\r\nto  provide  facilities sincerely and honestly  to\r\n\r\nthe bulk of the people who are educationally under-privileged, then it is an absolute must  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   throw  its  weight  behind   anybody.\r\n\r\ninstead  of  the  Government just  supporting  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Adult  Education,  I  think   it   is\r\n\r\nimperative that the Government should seek  to  do\r\n\r\nwhat it is seeking to do by this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps this is the\r\n\r\nappropriate   moment   to  examine   the   popular\r\n\r\nconception  of adult education here  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  that  of  adult education  organisations  in\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the world, and  to  examine  the\r\n\r\nexisting  conception of adult education  with  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  a Party that is dedicated  to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of the masses. In Singapore, Sir, our adult\r\n\r\neducation  has  actually meant, at least  so  far,\r\n\r\nproviding facilities for basic education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member gives the\r\n\r\ndistinct impression that he is reading his speech.\r\n\r\nI  know that he is not. But the impression  he  is\r\n\r\ncreating  in my mind and perhaps in the  minds  of\r\n\r\nother  hon.  Members is that  he  is  reading  his\r\n\r\nspeech.  Perhaps he could refrain from lifting  up\r\n\r\nhis  file,  which  makes  it  appear  that  he  is\r\n\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As a matter of fact, Sir, I was not\r\n\r\nreading.  As I was saying, in Singapore, at  least\r\n\r\nup  to now, adult education has meant the teaching\r\n\r\nof  languages - basic education. If one goes  around\r\n\r\nto the various centres, one will find the teaching\r\n\r\nof A, B, C in the various languages. One will find\r\n\r\nmen and women learning to speak, learning to write\r\n\r\nand learning to read the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguages. But in other parts of the world, things\r\n\r\nare  quite different. In countries like India  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, for instance, besides what is popularly\r\n\r\nknown  as  workers'  education,  they  have   mass\r\n\r\nliteracy  classes  spreading far  and  wide;  they\r\n\r\nextend  to  all the institutions of the  masses - to\r\n\r\nthe farms and to the slums. Workers' education  as\r\n\r\nsuch  is  perhaps not as wide as it  is  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries, which I am about to name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries, which are highly industrialised\r\n\r\nand  developed,  like those in  Europe,  the  term\r\n\r\n\"workers' education\" has a historical distinction.\r\n\r\nWhatever workers' education is interpreted to  be,\r\n\r\nit has often been debated, and it has been a point\r\n\r\nthat  is still in dispute. Various countries  have\r\n\r\ngot  various  interpretations for the  meaning  of\r\n\r\n\"workers' education\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to define in one way or\r\n\r\nanother  what actually workers' education is.  But\r\n\r\nwhat I do intend to point out is this. Quite apart\r\n\r\nfrom  just  teaching the A, B, C  of  the  various\r\n\r\nlanguages,   in   countries   like   Denmark,   in\r\n\r\nScandinavia   and  other  countries   in   Europe,\r\n\r\nworkers'  education has meant providing facilities\r\n\r\nfor professional training. They provide facilities\r\n\r\nto  enable the workers to attend work in their own\r\n\r\norganisations,  and  to  be  able  to  carry   out\r\n\r\neffective  functions  in  organisations  like  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and other societies. But  I  am  not\r\n\r\nhere to elaborate on what workers' education is. I\r\n\r\nam  not  suggesting  that in Singapore  we  should\r\n\r\ndisregard the literacy classes, and start teaching\r\n\r\ntechnical subjects to workers in classes organised\r\n\r\nby  the  trade  unions and by the Government.  But\r\n\r\nwhat I do say is that a start must be made in this\r\n\r\ndirection,  as a start has already been  made:  in\r\n\r\ncountries like India and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, as I have said, it is true that\r\n\r\nbasic education classes are necessary for the time\r\n\r\nbeing,  because without basic literacy, you  could\r\n\r\nnot  provide  technical education to  improve  the\r\n\r\nprofessional knowledge of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is first and foremost the\r\n\r\ntransmission  and  acquisition  of  language.   It\r\n\r\nshould  be  our  purpose  to  enable  students  to\r\n\r\nacquire  comparatively complete knowledge and  not\r\n\r\nincomplete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknowledge. The education must provide an all-round\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and be the medium of producing  fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped  human beings. Facilities and conditions\r\n\r\nmust  be  provided  for  the educationally  under-privileged  in Singapore with this in  mind.  Just\r\n\r\nbecause  adults are grown-ups. I think  we  should\r\n\r\nnot disregard this fundamental requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to state that if and when\r\n\r\nthe  Board  is  instituted and starts functioning,\r\n\r\nthe  success  of  the literacy campaign  will  not\r\n\r\nentirely  depend  on the Board. To  a  very  large\r\n\r\nextent,  the voluntary organisations, the cultural\r\n\r\nbodies, the various associations will have to play\r\n\r\ntheir part in contributing to the substance of the\r\n\r\ndrive.  Especially  in  the  initial  stages,  the\r\n\r\ndevotion and dedication of the teachers will be  a\r\n\r\nmust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, until recently, teachers of adult classes,\r\n\r\nas  I  have said earlier, received $7.50 per hour,\r\n\r\nand   more  often  than  not,  the  incentive  for\r\n\r\nteaching  adult  classes had  been  the  lucrative\r\n\r\nconditions  that  prevailed.  Under  the   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  is  extremely  necessary  that\r\n\r\nteachers  should  come  forward  with  a  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and  self-sacrificing  attitude  in\r\n\r\ntrying to aid the Government to make this campaign\r\n\r\nfor  mass  literacy a success, and to  help  their\r\n\r\nbrethren  by providing and teaching languages  and\r\n\r\nthe   rest   in  order  to  achieve  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nobjectives of the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the most important factor for the\r\n\r\ntrue  transformation of a society, and  therefore,\r\n\r\nat  this  stage in Singapore, it is  completely  a\r\n\r\nnecessity that there should be every force  turned\r\n\r\nand united to bring about a revival of our greater\r\n\r\nvalues and our educational values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would end by saying this. Although the\r\n\r\nteachers  may be missing the $7.50 very badly,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  brought to their minds that what  is  at\r\n\r\nstake  is  the  national interest - an interest  far\r\n\r\nabove the financial interests of the teachers as a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I appreciate the  Government's\r\n\r\neffort  to improve and unify the system  of  adult\r\n\r\neducation.  However, the community's  contribution\r\n\r\ntowards the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromotion  and improvement of adult  education  in\r\n\r\nthe  country  is  valuable, and  that  is  why  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Tanglin, has  advocated\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board should not be too  heavy  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side, but should be as  representative\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is all very well for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  authorities to work out a  formula  on\r\n\r\nthe  number of hours of teachers' work. But  as  I\r\n\r\nhave always tried to impress upon the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation,  it  is  the  implementation  and   the\r\n\r\npractice of it that is the most important, because\r\n\r\nin  practice, it is not always what it appears  to\r\n\r\nbe  on  paper. I will give one example. A  teacher\r\n\r\nwho  is  supposed  to  do an  extra  hour  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoon  actually does two hours,  if  not  more\r\n\r\nbecause  it takes half an hour to go and  half  an\r\n\r\nhour  to come back. Therefore, it takes two  hours\r\n\r\nof  his  time,  and sometimes one hour  of  travel\r\n\r\ntakes  more  out of him than one hour's  teaching,\r\n\r\nespecially  if there is a traffic jam. The  reason\r\n\r\nwhy we want the Board to be representative is that\r\n\r\npeople who have gone through the mill are the best\r\n\r\npeople  to draw up this formula. The Minister  has\r\n\r\nindicated  just  now  that  the  publicity   given\r\n\r\nconcerning  the strain on the teachers  caused  by\r\n\r\nthe  imposition  of these extra hours  is  grossly\r\n\r\nexaggerated. He has quoted as proof  of  this  the\r\n\r\nnumber of teachers that were doing extra paid jobs\r\n\r\nlast  year and this year. It must be pointed  out,\r\n\r\nhowever, that in the instances quoted, it was open\r\n\r\nto the teachers to choose, and it was the teachers\r\n\r\nwho can stand the strain who applied for the extra\r\n\r\nhours  of  work. Not everybody is capable  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  amount of work. There are some who are  full\r\n\r\nof energy and for whom the number of normal hours'\r\n\r\nwork  was  not sufficient, and they wanted  to  do\r\n\r\nmore.  There  are  others who did  it  because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial pressure. If I remember right, the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  about  one-tenth of the number  of  teachers\r\n\r\napplied  for permission to do extra teaching  this\r\n\r\nyear as compared with that of last year shows that\r\n\r\nthe strain is telling on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister for Education will take\r\n\r\na serious view of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  He  is going to offer  a  transport\r\n\r\nallowance. But, nevertheless, I would say that  if\r\n\r\nit  is possible for him not to make it compulsory,\r\n\r\nprobably  some  teachers who could not  stand  the\r\n\r\nstrain may not apply for the extra allowance to do\r\n\r\nthe extra job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned that a\r\n\r\nnecessary  quality of a teacher is  dedication  to\r\n\r\nhis or her job. It is very true, and one cannot be\r\n\r\ndedicated to his or her job when one is forced  to\r\n\r\ndo what one feels is more than humanly possible in\r\n\r\nhis or her particular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

When he  was\r\n\r\nasked  to write an essay on an elephant, he  began\r\n\r\nby  saying:  \"Now, let us start  with  the  Polish\r\n\r\nquestion.\"  Similarly with the  Members  opposite.\r\n\r\nThis  is a Bill dealing with the problem of  adult\r\n\r\neducation,   and  we  have  had  very   passionate\r\n\r\ndiscourses on overworked teachers and back pay for\r\n\r\nteachers, which have nothing to do with this Bill.\r\n\r\nI  therefore  feel that perhaps -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nobody said this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member opposite did not\r\n\r\nlisten  to  the  speeches of  his  colleagues.  He\r\n\r\nprobably focused his attention on what happened op\r\n\r\nthis  side of the Bench. But there was a plea made\r\n\r\nfor back-pay. I feel that it would, therefore,  be\r\n\r\nappropriate to draw the attention of this House to\r\n\r\nthe importance and purpose of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is, as the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  has indicated earlier, that  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  half  a million illiterates. I  would  say,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  view  of the fact that we have  accepted\r\n\r\nMalay  as the national language, perhaps the  term\r\n\r\n\"illiterate\"  should be extended to include  those\r\n\r\npersons  who  have  not become proficient  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  language, and today, there  are  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  illiterates. It would be most  unwise  to\r\n\r\nlet  them  remain illiterate, in view of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   now   ventured  into  this  new   political\r\n\r\nexperiment of having a Government elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople. So if you are going to have half a million\r\n\r\nilliterates  - although that does  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmean  that  they  have no political  wisdom  - then\r\n\r\ncertainly if you provide them with the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  be  able to make political decisions to  elect\r\n\r\ncandidates  from  time  to time,  perhaps  with  a\r\n\r\ngreater  increase in literacy, there will be  more\r\n\r\nMembers  on  this side of the House  than  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side. But if it is necessary for  democracy\r\n\r\nto  function  efficiently, then we should  provide\r\n\r\npeople  with the means of acquiring the  necessary\r\n\r\nknowledge  to  be  able to choose  wisely  and  to\r\n\r\nensure that democracy succeeds. That is one of the\r\n\r\npurposes of this Bill, and to that extent it is an\r\n\r\nimportant  Bill; because if we do not educate  the\r\n\r\nhalf  million  illiterate people in this  country,\r\n\r\nthen  we  are  going to weaken the  foundation  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. It is not only a question of  educating\r\n\r\nthem.  The  illiterates must  also  include  those\r\n\r\nadults  who  terminate their education  once  they\r\n\r\nleave  school.  It  is a fallacy often  propagated\r\n\r\nthat because a person has been to school for 15 or\r\n\r\n16  years  of  his  life, he  will,  once  he  has\r\n\r\nfinished  his schooling, remain a literate  person\r\n\r\nfor  the  rest  of  his life. Literacy  should  be\r\n\r\nsomething going all the time. People should always\r\n\r\nbe  learning, especially in a complex society like\r\n\r\nours  where knowledge is advancing and the  issues\r\n\r\nbecome  more  complex. It is necessary  that  even\r\n\r\nthose who have had the benefit of education should\r\n\r\nbe  continually educated, and one of the functions\r\n\r\nof  adult education would also be to enable people\r\n\r\nwho  have  left  school  to  keep  up  with  their\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points, which was stressed, by one of\r\n\r\nthe  Members opposite was that there is not enough\r\n\r\nrepresentation   for  teachers.   Another   Member\r\n\r\nindicated  that  there was no  representation  for\r\n\r\nthis  or  that  community. Obviously,  Sir,  every\r\n\r\ncommunity   group - from  bricklayers  to   mothers,\r\n\r\nartists  and  musicians - can  make  claims  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented on this Council. But obviously we have\r\n\r\nto   draw  the  line  somewhere  as  far  as   the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Board is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have to choose a limited number of people, and\r\n\r\nobviously  a great many will have to be left  out.\r\n\r\nBut  that does not preclude, for example, teachers\r\n\r\nfrom  participating in the work of  this  Council,\r\n\r\nbecause   there   will  be  various  opportunities\r\n\r\nafforded to them to help in the work of the  Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Council. Therefore, the claim that  this\r\n\r\ngroup  or  that  group is not represented  on  the\r\n\r\nCouncil is one, which can be made by any body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the claim that Government will be more\r\n\r\nthan well represented on the Board, may I draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of Members opposite that, if they  look\r\n\r\nback   to  the  history  of  the  adult  education\r\n\r\nmovement  in Singapore during the last  10  years,\r\n\r\nthey  might  have had occasion to read stories  of\r\n\r\nsome  peculiar  goings-on in the  field  of  adult\r\n\r\neducation?  There  were  investigations  into  the\r\n\r\naccounts   of   adult   education   organisations.\r\n\r\nCertainly when you are dealing with half a million\r\n\r\ndollars which the Government is paying out, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Government,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of   the  work  of  providing   adult\r\n\r\neducation,  and  in view of the  past  (I  am  not\r\n\r\nreferring to what has happened in the recent past,\r\n\r\nbut  to  the  early  days of the  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil when money obviously was treated in a very\r\n\r\ncavalier fashion and was never accounted  for)  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  tighter control over this Board.  But  if\r\n\r\nmembers of the public, whether they be teachers or\r\n\r\nmusicians  or  artists or the Member for  Tanglin,\r\n\r\nwish  to  contribute to the work of  the  Council,\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing to prevent them from doing  so,\r\n\r\nand  certainly  there is nothing  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nMinister from inviting them to participate in  the\r\n\r\nwork of this Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I can say that every active\r\n\r\nlabour  organisation is running adult classes  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of providing education to its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while debating this Bill, the Member for Kampong Kembangan initially argued that\r\n\r\nhe  did  not  know how to debate it. He  continued\r\n\r\nfurther  by  saying that it is a  Bill  for  which\r\n\r\ncredit  could be given but that he regretted  that\r\n\r\nin clause 5, there is an element of discrimination\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Malay  Education  Council   is   not\r\n\r\nrepresented. Mr Speaker, as far as  I  know,  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education Council (and I believe the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kembangan is a member of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Council)  has  no  interest  in  giving\r\n\r\neducation  to adults. The Malay Education  Council\r\n\r\nconcentrates  only  on Malay  education  in  Malay\r\n\r\nschools. Under the circumstances, Mr Speaker,  it\r\n\r\nis not true to say that the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nis  treating  the  Malay Education  Council  as  a\r\n\r\nstepson.  The  Malay Education  Council  has  been\r\n\r\ninvited. There is a representative from the  Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Council who sits on the Malay Education\r\n\r\nCommittee of the Ministry of Education.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso one member who sits on the Education Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Quite recently, Mr Speaker, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kembangan referred to an appointment\r\n\r\nto   replace  an  outgoing  member  in  the  Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Committee suggesting  that  the  person\r\n\r\nshould sit on the Malay Advisory Council as  well,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  other  member  had  left  for  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  On account of the fact that the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education had given his full attention to the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education  Council, this  matter  was  left\r\n\r\nentirely  to the discretion of the Malay Education\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  appoint  a suitable  nominee  to  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Malay Education Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Board is to provide education\r\n\r\nfor  adults. Its composition is fitting and proper\r\n\r\nbecause   the   Teachers'  Training   College   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  provides education  for  teachers;  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the University  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nare also institutions, which provide education for\r\n\r\nadults;  and  there  are two members  representing\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  every\r\n\r\nactive  trade  union  is running  adult  education\r\n\r\nclasses  for  its  members.  The  appointment   is\r\n\r\ntherefore proper, Mr Speaker. The accusation  was\r\n\r\nlevelled by the Member for Kampong Kembangan  that\r\n\r\nas the Malay Education Council is not mentioned he\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  this  was  treating  the   Malay\r\n\r\nEducation Council like a stepson. In the report of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay Education Council, there is no  mention\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  of its object for giving education  to\r\n\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Yes,\r\n\r\nSir.  The  memorandum  from  the  Malay  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil sent to the Minister for Education in 1957\r\n\r\nmade  no  mention  of adult education.  The  Malay\r\n\r\nEducation Council concerned itself only with Malay\r\n\r\neducation  in  Malay  schools.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation   has   given  an  opportunity   for   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the Malay Education  Council  to\r\n\r\nsit on the Education Advisory Council and also  to\r\n\r\nsit  on  the  Malay  Education Committee.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan fears that the Malays\r\n\r\nare not represented on this Board, this is because\r\n\r\nhe  has  not made a thorough investigation.  Among\r\n\r\nthe  representatives of trade unions, there are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of Malays who are actively taking part  in\r\n\r\nconducting Malay classes. These members  are  well\r\n\r\nversed in the Malay language. I believe the former\r\n\r\nteachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  teach  in these special classes run  by  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions. I know that the T.U.C. will nominate\r\n\r\nsuitable persons to represent the workers  in  the\r\n\r\nLembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa. I hope that with\r\n\r\nthe enactment of this Bill, the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan   will   not  have   fears   about   the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I believe nobody\r\n\r\nwho is of sound mind will say that this Bill is no\r\n\r\ngood, or that its objects are bad, because we  all\r\n\r\nknow the importance of knowledge and education  to\r\n\r\nthe  people as a whole. Therefore, I rise  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the aim of the Government is good. I  am  of\r\n\r\nsound mind and I know the meaning of education and\r\n\r\nthe   value  of  knowledge  to  society.  We  have\r\n\r\nlistened  to many speeches made by the  Government\r\n\r\nside   comparing  the  work  done  by   the   past\r\n\r\nGovernment  with the present Government's  efforts\r\n\r\nto  unify  the education system so as to inculcate\r\n\r\ninto   the   people  of  Singapore  a   sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  towards  the  State  through   the\r\n\r\nmedium of education and knowledge, which they have\r\n\r\ngained. But we must not forget, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nthese  efforts  require  a  tremendous  amount  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  and  entail sacrifices, especially  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government side and from those who have  been\r\n\r\nentrusted with the task of implementing this Bill.\r\n\r\nThey must have a full sense of responsibility  and\r\n\r\na  love for the work, which they are doing, in the\r\n\r\ninterests of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been said by the Opposition Bench is\r\n\r\nthat  persons who will be assigned to  fulfil  the\r\n\r\ntasks  must also be given opportunities to express\r\n\r\ntheir  opinions,  which  will  be  useful  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  clause 5, on the composition  and\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  the  Board,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned about the administration and expenditure\r\n\r\nof moneys. This Government need have no fear about\r\n\r\nthis.  This  is  not an essential  factor  of  our\r\n\r\ncriticism. It can be said that, on the whole,  the\r\n\r\nappointments are all agreed to by the  Government.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  mean is that no nominee can sit  on  this\r\n\r\nBoard  without the sanction of the Government.  If\r\n\r\nwe need the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operation of those who will be responsible for\r\n\r\nimplementing  the policy of the  Lembaga  Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran Dewasa, then I feel, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nwork  through pressure or coercion will not bring\r\n\r\nabout  the  desired results, unlike  the  results\r\n\r\nthat  could  be achieved from persons who  fulfil\r\n\r\ntheir  task with a sense of dedication  to  their\r\n\r\njob  and  a sense of self-sacrifice. Such  people\r\n\r\nare prepared not only to work for eight hours but\r\n\r\nthey  are prepared to work longer and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  must  be  given an opportunity  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir views on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to what the Member for Ulu Pandan has\r\n\r\nsaid  on  the  Malay Education  Council,  and  as\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  by  the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,  Mr  Speaker, I am  afraid  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan himself does not know  what\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  Education Council is. Indirectly  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education  Council  does  not  merely  lay\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  Malay education. But  from  what  I\r\n\r\nknow,  it  has  affiliate  bodies  of  about   30\r\n\r\nassociations.  They  form  the  Malay   Education\r\n\r\nCouncil for the purpose of Malay education. There\r\n\r\nmust  be  some  connection in the work  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing  with  the  Board, which  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\ninitiated   by   the   Government.   Surely   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will also include Malay as a  subject.\r\n\r\nIt  is  essential, therefore, that  the  Council,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  recognised by many  Malay  educational\r\n\r\nbodies, should be given an opportunity to express\r\n\r\nits  views concerning the implementation of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I should\r\n\r\nlike  to answer the Member for Tanglin who  fears\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposed composition of the Board  for\r\n\r\nAdult  Education  and the taking  over  of  adult\r\n\r\neducation  by the Government through a  statutory\r\n\r\nBoard   might  stifle  the  efforts  of   private\r\n\r\nenterprise.  One  would  have  thought  that  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which Government has been  conducting\r\n\r\nits  affairs  would  have been sufficient  answer\r\n\r\nthat such fears are unjustified and that, if any,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is afraid that when it  comes  to\r\n\r\nwork there will not be enough people around to do\r\n\r\nthe hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of the Opposition have raised\r\n\r\nthe  point that the Board, as proposed,  has  too\r\n\r\nheavy    a   Governmental   representation.    My\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Minister for Culture, has  already\r\n\r\nindicated  that  some years ago the  public  were\r\n\r\nshocked  at  the  report  that  was  released  on\r\n\r\ninvestigations into funds which were  handled  by\r\n\r\nthe   then   Council  for  Adult  Education,   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member  for  Thomson,  has  also\r\n\r\ndisclosed   certain   facts   that   records   of\r\n\r\nattendances in classes for 30 or 40 students  had\r\n\r\nactually  10 students. It is, I think,  essential\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should ensure  that  public\r\n\r\nfunds are properly spent and accounted for.  This\r\n\r\nAdult Education Board, when established, would, I\r\n\r\nthink, be handling funds to the tune of a million\r\n\r\ndollars,  for besides the half a million  dollars\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government would grant to this  Board,\r\n\r\nit would also be in receipt of fees which, on the\r\n\r\npresent enrolment of 40,000 at $1 a month,  would\r\n\r\nbe  $480,000  a year. So I think it is  essential\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board  should have  reasonably  enough\r\n\r\nGovernmental  representation to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   policy  on  adult   education   is\r\n\r\nproperly conducted and that sufficient care would\r\n\r\nbe  taken to ensure that the classes are properly\r\n\r\nheld.  As  you  can see from the clauses  in  the\r\n\r\nBill,  there would be properly audited  accounts,\r\n\r\ncopies  of  which  would  be  presented  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly for their information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the criticism that there is no\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the teachers'  unions  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  I  expect  that  teachers'  unions  would\r\n\r\nultimately come within the purview of the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion    Congress   and   that   the    teachers'\r\n\r\nrepresentative  would  then  come  through   that\r\n\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Ulu Pandan, has\r\n\r\nalready answered the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nas  to  why the proposed Bill does not include  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative from the Malay Education  Council.\r\n\r\nI  am  only  sorry  that the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan should consider it discriminatory  just\r\n\r\nbecause there is no representative from the Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Council.  I  suppose  if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Council then it is not discriminatory.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I am not inclined to follow that  line  of\r\n\r\nargument.  The  Member for Kampong Kembangan  also\r\n\r\nasked about back pay. It is not the policy of this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  talk  in terms  of  back  pay.  My\r\n\r\nannouncement this afternoon did indicate that from\r\n\r\nMonday onwards, which is only about 48 hours  from\r\n\r\nnow,  all  so-called volunteers will be reimbursed\r\n\r\nat  the rate of $2 per session. I think it is  not\r\n\r\ntoo  long  a  time  for  them  to  wait  for  this\r\n\r\ntransport allowance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Member for Tanglin and the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  raised the question of  hardship  and\r\n\r\nstrain on the part of teachers in respect of extra\r\n\r\nsession  work. I think the Member for the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  also mentioned that coercion or  pressure\r\n\r\nwould not bring about the desired results. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could be confident that teachers  would\r\n\r\nvolunteer  in their thousands to do  the  work  of\r\n\r\nadult   education,  then  I  am  sure   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be prepared to forget the idea of\r\n\r\nthe extra session work and let the work be done by\r\n\r\nvoluntary  teachers. But let us be realistic.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I have already mentioned  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  an  illiterate population of half a  million\r\n\r\npeople  and that, despite the fact that Government\r\n\r\nis  now conducting classes for 40,000, we are only\r\n\r\nscratching  the surface. We are not even  handling\r\n\r\nten  per cent of what we intend to handle.  As  an\r\n\r\nexample  of  the nature of voluntary work,  may  I\r\n\r\nrefer to the call for blood donors started by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Health?  The  call  was  made   for\r\n\r\nvolunteers   to  donate  blood.   I   was   rather\r\n\r\ndisappointed when the final returns came to  hand,\r\n\r\nbecause  out  of  the  10,000 teachers,  only  741\r\n\r\nvolunteered. If we call for volunteers  for  adult\r\n\r\neducation and other aspects of education  and  the\r\n\r\nsame  result should come to pass, then I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat  our illiterate population in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nremain as it is five years from now. I agree  that\r\n\r\nin  the matter of implementation, hardships may be\r\n\r\ncaused  but  these  are  details  which  could  be\r\n\r\narranged.   If  names  of  teachers   in   schools\r\n\r\nresponsible for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespatch of teachers miles out could be mentioned,\r\n\r\nsurely the Ministry of Education and its officials\r\n\r\nare not that irresponsible in that they refuse  to\r\n\r\nsee  reason or to discuss the matter. If,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin suggested, certain teachers are\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently strong to stand  the  strain  of\r\n\r\nextra  sessions and would be so medically advised,\r\n\r\nsurely  the Ministry of Education is not going  to\r\n\r\nignore the medical certificates to that effect and\r\n\r\nexempt  the particular teachers when even  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  their  ordinary  duty  they  are   not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  teach  in schools  if  they  produce\r\n\r\nmedical certificates. I would have hoped that  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for  Tanglin  and  Mountbatten,  as   ex-teachers  or as people who are so much  interested\r\n\r\nin  education, would appreciate the problems  that\r\n\r\nface  this Government; but we welcome constructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from  them, who  are  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the strain on teachers, the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten,   I   am  afraid,   has   ungallantly\r\n\r\nmisquoted  me  when she says that I stated  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  that the publicity given to the strain  on\r\n\r\nteachers was grossly unjustified (I took  it  down\r\n\r\nexactly  as  she stated it). What  I  said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech was that undue publicity was not justified,\r\n\r\nand I am afraid she has introduced words, which  I\r\n\r\nhave not used. If, instead of beating the big drum\r\n\r\nabout  the strain on teachers, the Members of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition would see the problem as it  faces  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and our endeavours to do what  we  can\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore a shining example in the  whole\r\n\r\nof  South-East Asia, they will then appreciate why\r\n\r\nit  is necessary to call upon teachers to do their\r\n\r\nlittle bit for their country. In this respect, the\r\n\r\nspeeches  made by the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nand  the Member for the Southern Islands strike  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  tone. The first Member said that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  less  talk and more work.  The  second\r\n\r\nMember   also  spoke  about  sacrifices  for   the\r\n\r\ncountry.  That is exactly what we are asking  for.\r\n\r\nIn  nation building, one does not relax in a chair\r\n\r\nand  let  others do the work. Let us, by  example,\r\n\r\nshow what we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute to the well-being of the country. I say\r\n\r\nthat  those who are fortunate enough to have  been\r\n\r\neducated  have  a  greater responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  especially to those who  have  been\r\n\r\ndenied  the opportunity of education and  who  are\r\n\r\nblind  to  all  the wonders which  literature  can\r\n\r\noffer.  Therefore, I say that the burden of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding is greater for teachers and I hope - we all\r\n\r\nhope -   that  they  will be able  to  rise  to  the\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you had ruled that\r\n\r\nin your opinion this bill is a hybrid Bill, I therefore\r\n\r\nmove under Standing Order 65 (1),\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee consisting of Mr.\r\n\r\nSpeaker as Chairman and the following seven members:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n   Mr S.

The Government\r\n\r\nis  deeply  conscious  that  a  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive,   no  matter  how  good  its   aims   and\r\n\r\nintentions are, if corruption exists in its  ranks\r\n\r\nand  its  public services on which it  depends  to\r\n\r\nprovide the efficient and effective administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery to translate its policies into action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only to look at post-war Asia to realise\r\n\r\nhow  evil and damaging the scourge can be.  K.M.T.\r\n\r\nChina   collapsed  principally  because   of   the\r\n\r\ndemoralising influence of bribery and  corruption.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of constitutional governments and the\r\n\r\nchaos  and  confusion  in  certain  of  the  newly\r\n\r\nindependent  countries  in  South-East   Asia   is\r\n\r\nlargely  a  result of the prevalence of corruption\r\n\r\nin  the  governments. No country in the  resurgent\r\n\r\nAsia  can  survive if the political leadership  is\r\n\r\ncorrupt;  much  less, if corruption  has  corroded\r\n\r\ninto  the roots of the public service as well.  It\r\n\r\nis  of  interest  to note that in  post-war  Asia,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  public service in a country  has  been\r\n\r\nundermined and demoralised by corruption, the rule\r\n\r\nof  dictatorship follows inevitably. If we do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  see  the same pattern being repeated  in\r\n\r\nthis country, then adequate power must be given to\r\n\r\ndeal effectively with the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigour and the clean leadership of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. makes possible the elimination of the evils\r\n\r\nof  corruption. The clean record of the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthe  last City Council was a striking contrast  to\r\n\r\nthat  corrupt  old regime under the leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park and had won  all-round\r\n\r\nacclaim from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government has, during the first eight\r\n\r\nmonths of its period of office, given ample  proof\r\n\r\nof  its  dedication  of purpose,  its  honesty  of\r\n\r\naction and its abhorrence of corruption. Its civil\r\n\r\nservice  is on the whole a well-trained, efficient\r\n\r\nand  honest one and compares favourably  in  these\r\n\r\nrespects  with  those of other countries  in  this\r\n\r\npart of the world. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit would be dishonest to deny that corruption does\r\n\r\nnot  exist  and  that  there  is  no  problem   of\r\n\r\ncorruption in the public services. Although it may\r\n\r\nnot  be  so  rife  as to create public  alarm  and\r\n\r\ndespondency,   yet  it  nevertheless   calls   for\r\n\r\nunceasing  vigilance  and  all  possible  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures. Corruption on the part, of some must not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to smirch the good name of the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the large majority  of  its  civil\r\n\r\nservants. Therefore, this Government is determined\r\n\r\nto  take  all  possible  steps  to  see  that  all\r\n\r\nnecessary legislative and administrative  measures\r\n\r\nare   taken   to   reduce  the  opportunities   of\r\n\r\ncorruption,  to make its detection easier  and  to\r\n\r\ndeter   and   punish  severely   those   who   are\r\n\r\nsusceptible to it and engage in it shamelessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this Bill, the Government is\r\n\r\nasking  for new and wider powers to fight  bribery\r\n\r\nand  corruption.  As  stated  in  the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement,  the object of this Bill is to  provide\r\n\r\nfor the more effective prevention of corruption by\r\n\r\nremedying  various  weaknesses and  defects  which\r\n\r\nexperience has revealed in the existing Prevention\r\n\r\nof  Corruption Ordinance. The Bill, while directed\r\n\r\nmainly  at  corruption in the public services,  is\r\n\r\napplicable  also to corruption by private  agents,\r\n\r\ntrustees  and  others in a fiduciary capacity.  To\r\n\r\nthose  who corrupt and those who are corrupt,  the\r\n\r\nwarning  is  clear - take heed and mend their  ways.\r\n\r\nJust retribution will follow those who persist  in\r\n\r\ncorrupt practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Ordinance, consisting as it does of\r\n\r\nonly  12  sections, has been found from experience\r\n\r\nto  be limited in the scope of its provisions  and\r\n\r\ninadequate  for the more effective prevention  and\r\n\r\ndetection of corruption. There have been instances\r\n\r\nbefore  where  offenders have been able  to  evade\r\n\r\nprosecution or escape conviction because  of  some\r\n\r\nweakness  or  defect  in  the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The  existing Ordinance  is  therefore\r\n\r\nbeing  repealed and replaced by the present  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich is much more comprehensive in its scope. The\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement has gone to some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlength\r\n\r\nand  detail  in  explaining the principal  changes\r\n\r\nmade by the Bill and therefore I do not propose to\r\n\r\ndescribe  the  Bill  clause by clause,  I  should,\r\n\r\nhowever,  like to draw the attention of the  House\r\n\r\nto  some of the new provisions which will help  to\r\n\r\nremedy  the  weaknesses of the existing Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand to the additional powers which are to be given\r\n\r\nto the Director of Corrupt Practices Investigation\r\n\r\nBureau  and his senior staff in order to help  the\r\n\r\nBureau  to carry out its primary objects,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe prevention and detection of corruption and the\r\n\r\nprosecution   of  offenders,  if   corruption   is\r\n\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that end in view, clause 27 now provides\r\n\r\nthat  all  offences  under the Ordinance  will  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to be seizable offences instead  of  being\r\n\r\nnon-seizable offences under the existing law. This\r\n\r\nwould  enable  the Bureau to deal  with  offenders\r\n\r\nmore speedily and effectively under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIn   a  non-seizable  offence,  a  police  officer\r\n\r\ninvestigating a case cannot use his special powers\r\n\r\nof  investigation of requiring witnesses to attend\r\n\r\nbefore  him  and  taking statements,  nor  can  he\r\n\r\narrest  or search premises without a warrant.  The\r\n\r\nBureau's practice at present is to proceed against\r\n\r\na  person initially under sections 161 to  165  of\r\n\r\nthe  Penal Code, and later amend the charges under\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance. This will no longer be necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso by virtue of clause 15, powers of arrest  and\r\n\r\nsearch of arrested persons are now granted to  the\r\n\r\nBureau's special investigators, whereas at present\r\n\r\nsimilar  investigators employed in the Bureau  are\r\n\r\nnot so empowered. Another procedural provision  is\r\n\r\nthat  made  in  clause  20, which  enables  police\r\n\r\nofficers where delay would frustrate the object of\r\n\r\nthe  search without a warrant. At present,  police\r\n\r\nofficers and Bureau officers have to fall back  on\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code  in\r\n\r\norder to take such action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other additional powers given to the Bureau\r\n\r\nwhich  will  `be very helpful in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation are contained in clauses 17, 18 and\r\n\r\n25.  Clause 17 empowers the Public Prosecutor  to\r\n\r\nauthorise   the   Director  and  senior   special\r\n\r\ninvestigators  to investigate any  bank  account,\r\n\r\nshare  account or purchase account of any  person\r\n\r\nsuspected of having committed an offence  against\r\n\r\nthe   Prevention  of  Corruption  Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nclause  18  empowers  the  Public  Prosecutor  to\r\n\r\nauthorise   the   Director  and  senior   special\r\n\r\ninvestigators   to  inspect  a   banker's   books\r\n\r\nrelating to a public servant, his wife, child  or\r\n\r\nagent, if he considers evidence of the commission\r\n\r\nof an offence of corruption is likely to be found\r\n\r\nin  such  books. These two clauses will  be  very\r\n\r\nuseful  and  make for less dilatory procedure  in\r\n\r\nthe  investigation stage in dealing with  corrupt\r\n\r\npublic    servants,    particularly    in     the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of their money and property in  all\r\n\r\nforms.  Clause 25 makes it a legal obligation  on\r\n\r\nany  person  to  give  such  information  on  any\r\n\r\nsubject  which it is in his power to  give,  when\r\n\r\nrequired to do so by a special investigator,  and\r\n\r\nfailure to do so is punishable on conviction by a\r\n\r\nfine   or   imprisonment,  or  both,  under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  clause 24, which is  also  a  new\r\n\r\nclause providing for penalties for obstructing or\r\n\r\nassaulting    police   officers    and    special\r\n\r\ninvestigators in the execution of  their  duties\r\n\r\nunder  this  Ordinance, or refusing or neglecting\r\n\r\nto furnish them with any information which a person is required by them to do so and which he  is\r\n\r\nable to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now draw the attention of the House to\r\n\r\nsome of the other new provisions, which will help\r\n\r\nto  plug the loopholes and strengthen the  attack\r\n\r\non  corruption. Clause 2 lays down  a  wider  and\r\n\r\nmore embracing definition of \"gratification\".  By\r\n\r\nvirtue  of clause 9, it is now provided  that  an\r\n\r\nagent accepting an illegal gratification shall be\r\n\r\nguilty  of such offence notwithstanding the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  he  did  not  have  the  power,  right  nor\r\n\r\nopportunity  to do the act required  of  him  and\r\n\r\nalso  where he mistakenly believes that  the  act\r\n\r\nrequired   of   him  was  in  relation   to   his\r\n\r\nprincipal's  affairs or business.  Corresponding\r\n\r\nprovisions are made with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect  to a person giving or offering a  bribe.\r\n\r\nThis  new  clause  would make it  unnecessary  to\r\n\r\nprove  that  the acceptor of a bribe should  have\r\n\r\nbeen in a position to carry out the act or favour\r\n\r\nrequired  of him. Clause 13 empowers a  Court  to\r\n\r\norder  a  person  found guilty  of  accepting  an\r\n\r\nillegal  gratification to pay a penalty equal  to\r\n\r\nthe  amount of that gratification in addition  to\r\n\r\nany  other  punishment imposed, and such  penalty\r\n\r\nshall be recoverable as a fine. This will act  as\r\n\r\na  deterrent because, in addition to the  penalty\r\n\r\nfor  the  offence, the culprit is called upon  to\r\n\r\npay the amount he had taken as a bribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 22 are two important clauses,\r\n\r\nwhich will strengthen the hands of the Bureau  in\r\n\r\nits   work   of   detection  of  corruption   and\r\n\r\nprosecution  of  offenders.  Under   clause   19,\r\n\r\nsuspected  Government servants and  employees  of\r\n\r\npublic  bodies  can  be  made  to  furnish  sworn\r\n\r\nstatements  enumerating  property  belonging   to\r\n\r\nthem, their spouses and children and any property\r\n\r\nsent outside Singapore. Other persons can also be\r\n\r\nmade  to  furnish  similar statements  where  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor  has  reasonable  grounds   to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the information  will  assist  any\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into corruption  by  a  Government\r\n\r\nservant   or   employee   of   a   public   body.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  the  provisions  of  any   other\r\n\r\nwritten   law   to  the  contrary,   the   Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor   is   also   empowered   to    obtain\r\n\r\ninformation  from the Comptroller of  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  affairs of such  servants  and\r\n\r\nemployees and their spouses and children  and  to\r\n\r\nrequire  bank managers to supply copies of  their\r\n\r\nbank  statements and, to obtain any documents  in\r\n\r\nthe   possession   or   control   of   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and public bodies. Clause 22 provides\r\n\r\nthat  where an accused person is found to  be  in\r\n\r\npossession     of    property    or     resources\r\n\r\ndisproportionate to his known income for which he\r\n\r\ncannot give a satisfactory explanation, such fact\r\n\r\nwhich  appears to show that at or about the  time\r\n\r\nof  the alleged offence he has been bribed or  is\r\n\r\nin  the  habit of receiving bribes may be  proved\r\n\r\nand  may  be  taken by the Court as corroborating\r\n\r\nthe testimony of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  witness.  Similar evidence can  be  tendered\r\n\r\nagainst  him in respect of property or  resources\r\n\r\nin  the possession of relatives or other persons,\r\n\r\nwho are reasonably believed to be holding them on\r\n\r\nhis behalf or as a gift from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 is designed to relieve the Court of\r\n\r\nthe restrictions of the accomplice rule, that is,\r\n\r\nthat the evidence of an accomplice is held to  be\r\n\r\nunworthy  of credit unless corroborated. Offences\r\n\r\nof  bribery and corruption are usually  committed\r\n\r\nin  secret and not in the presence of any  person\r\n\r\nother  than the giver or receiver, and  therefore\r\n\r\nthis  accomplice rule has been a stumbling  block\r\n\r\nto many prosecutions in the past. It is felt that\r\n\r\nthe  reasons for treating accomplice evidence  as\r\n\r\ntainted, for example, the accomplice is generally\r\n\r\nof  bad  character or acting to escape punishment\r\n\r\nhimself or working off a grudge, need not  always\r\n\r\napply  to the giver of a bribe, and therefore  it\r\n\r\ncould  be left to the Court to form its own  view\r\n\r\nas  to whether, by his bearing, demeanour and the\r\n\r\nsubstance of his evidence, the giver of  a  bribe\r\n\r\nis a witness of truth or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 30, power is also now given to the\r\n\r\nCourt where two or more persons are charged  with\r\n\r\nan offence under this Ordinance to require one or\r\n\r\nmore  of  them to give evidence as a  witness  or\r\n\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, by clause 27, it becomes an offence for\r\n\r\na  public servant if he fails to arrest a  person\r\n\r\nwithout  reasonable excuse at the time when  that\r\n\r\nperson  has  given or offered him a  bribe.  This\r\n\r\nprovision will stop offenders from making excuses\r\n\r\nwhen   arrested.  For  instance,  instances  have\r\n\r\noccurred  where offenders have been acquitted  in\r\n\r\nCourt on the grounds that they were walking  away\r\n\r\nto  go  and  report to the Police when they  were\r\n\r\narrested. This clause will at least make them try\r\n\r\nto  arrest  the giver of a bribe or at  least  go\r\n\r\nstraight to the Police and report their inability\r\n\r\nto effect the arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses, which the House will be\r\n\r\ninterested in, are clauses 11 and 12, which  make\r\n\r\nit  an offence to offer a bribe to any Member  of\r\n\r\nthe Legislative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly,  or of a public body and for  any  such\r\n\r\nMember to solicit or accept a bribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, owing to the importance and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  nature of this  Bill,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government to commit  it  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee of the Assembly, where it can be\r\n\r\nstudied  in  greater  detail.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nconclude  by  saying that the present  Government\r\n\r\nwill  do  everything  in its power  to  eradicate\r\n\r\nbribery and corruption in the country, especially\r\n\r\nin  the  public  services. But it  must  also  be\r\n\r\nrealised  that  the attitude  of  the  public  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  an  equally  important  weapon  in   its\r\n\r\nelimination. We are striving to have in Singapore\r\n\r\na  public service which will be second to none in\r\n\r\nability,       efficiency,      honesty       and\r\n\r\nincorruptibility,   and   I   therefore    appeal\r\n\r\nconfidently  to the Members of this Assembly  and\r\n\r\nthe  public to play their part in achieving  this\r\n\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 4 (1),  I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items of\r\n\r\nbusiness  set down for this day be exempted  from\r\n\r\nthe provisions of Standing Order No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items of\r\n\r\nbusiness  set down for this day be exempted  from\r\n\r\nthe provisions of Standing Order No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today, this Assembly do stand\r\n\r\nadjourned to 2nd March 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today, this Assembly do stand\r\n\r\nadjourned to 2nd March. 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Second Reading resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Home Affairs, who  has  clearly\r\n\r\nstated  the  aims of the Prevention of  Corruption\r\n\r\nBill. Although previously in Singapore there  were\r\n\r\nprovisions  for the prevention of corruption,  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance and its provisions are now out  of  date\r\n\r\nand   not   applicable.  Therefore,  it  is   very\r\n\r\nnecessary to amend it and make it a more effective\r\n\r\nlegislation, to plug the loopholes so that we  can\r\n\r\neradicate corruption in the public services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fully studied the 1950 Ordinance of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, and it can be said  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  incorporated in our Bill the merits  of  the\r\n\r\nPrevention  of  Corruption  Ordinances  of   other\r\n\r\ncountries. Although we cannot say that our Bill is\r\n\r\nperfect, it can be said that, on the side  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  have tried our  best.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwith  the  passing  of this  Bill,  we  can  fully\r\n\r\nimplement  Government policy in this respect.  The\r\n\r\neradication of corruption is one of our programmes\r\n\r\nset  out  during the election. And today's  Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill indicates that we are  trying\r\n\r\nto  fulfil  our  promise.  We  are  determined  to\r\n\r\neradicate corruption. Previously, in the  eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore, the public service was  a\r\n\r\ncorrupt  and  inefficient bureaucratic  machinery.\r\n\r\nBecause  of this, bureaucracy is just a by-product\r\n\r\nof   corruption.  Whenever  someone  went  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  office,  more  often  than  not   they\r\n\r\nexperienced   some  unnecessary   difficulty   and\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Sometimes the dishonest public  servants\r\n\r\nreferred them to some other department instead  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own department, and said that such a  thing\r\n\r\nwas  not  workable. Therefore,  the  people  under\r\n\r\nthose  circumstances had to offer bribes  so  that\r\n\r\neverything could be solved. Even then it  was  not\r\n\r\npractical, and they would try some other  ways  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the problem. Therefore, in the eyes of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people, the Government  machinery\r\n\r\nwas just a place of exploitation on a large scale.\r\n\r\nI do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmean  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service every member was  corrupt  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  tried to oppress the people. There  were\r\n\r\nalso  many  clean, honest and able  officers,  but\r\n\r\nthey were smirched by the corrupt ones. Since  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government came into office, the atmosphere\r\n\r\nof  corruption  is now very much less  noticeable,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  corrupt officers have realised  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government would  not  tolerate  such\r\n\r\nillegal practices existing in the Government; and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  people  are courageous  enough  to\r\n\r\nconvey  their  grievances to their representatives\r\n\r\nwho  will  take effective steps to look into  the\r\n\r\nmatter. Therefore, these irresponsible officers at\r\n\r\npresent  do  not so openly try to  take  too  much\r\n\r\nadvantage.  It does not mean that the  problem  of\r\n\r\ncorruption   does  not  exist   in   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment  service. There are some  officers  who\r\n\r\nstill  continue with their illegal  practices.  To\r\n\r\nthese people, we will take unsympathetic steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the aim of this Bill is mainly\r\n\r\nto  extend the power of investigation and to widen\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"corruption\". The corrupt people\r\n\r\npreviously used to take too much advantage of  the\r\n\r\nloopholes  in  our  law,  so  much  so  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment were unable to take steps against them.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions  in  this Bill are  practical  and\r\n\r\nessential.  Only thus can we deal with  corruption\r\n\r\nin the Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Minister for Home Affairs has drawn the\r\n\r\nattention of this House to clause 11. This  clause\r\n\r\ndeals with Members of the Legislative Assembly  in\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of bribery. They will be  subject  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  fine.  The  inclusion  of  this\r\n\r\nclause  in  the  Bill is essential,  and  must  be\r\n\r\nattributed to the efforts of the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in China there is a proverb\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Promotion and getting prosperous.\"  This\r\n\r\nproverb  since recorded history up to the  present\r\n\r\nis  still  applied. This does not  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nscholars have widened its interpretation. In fact.\r\n\r\nin  the  history  of the world and  even  in  this\r\n\r\ntwentieth  century,  we  find  many  instances  of\r\n\r\n\"promotion   and   getting  prosperous\"   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   service.  If  a  government   servant\r\n\r\nbecomes an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficer  and  does  not become prosperous,  it  is\r\n\r\nrather  surprising.  In our primary  or  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  textbooks there is such a  record  of  the\r\n\r\nproverb  and  in  addition  we  have  it  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  too. The people can see for themselves\r\n\r\nthat the public service in the previous Government\r\n\r\nenjoyed  all  sorts  of benefits.  And  when  they\r\n\r\nretired, they left lots of riches and property  to\r\n\r\ntheir generation, so that the latter too can enjoy\r\n\r\na  higher  standard  of living.  At  present,  the\r\n\r\npeople can also see for themselves that those  who\r\n\r\nretire  from Government service can still continue\r\n\r\nto  enjoy life without having to work. So much  so\r\n\r\nthat some of them can afford to leave this country\r\n\r\nand lead a very happy life in other countries. All\r\n\r\nthis  gives the people the impression that  public\r\n\r\nofficers must be selfish and corrupt, but we  must\r\n\r\ntry to understand their psychological make-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the P.A.P. Government we do\r\n\r\nnot allow such things to exist. We not only do not\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  exist, but we  are  determind  to\r\n\r\neradicate them. In the meantime, we have  also  to\r\n\r\nmake  every officer an honest and obedient servant\r\n\r\nof  the  public. I believe that this Bill, studied\r\n\r\nby the Select Committee and subsequently passed in\r\n\r\nthis   Assembly,  will  really  prevent   corrupt\r\n\r\npractices in the Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, just now our Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs moved the Second Reading of the Prevention\r\n\r\nof  Corruption Bill. This is an appropriate  time\r\n\r\nto  present this Bill, as it meets with the desire\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore. En the old Government,\r\n\r\ncorruption  was  rife. This is very  bad  and  the\r\n\r\npeople thought it was a part of their daily  life.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we know that if the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  under a bad rule  and  corruption\r\n\r\nprevailed, and they were aware, of this, then they\r\n\r\nwould  rise  and  try  their  best  to  eradicate\r\n\r\ncorruption.   We  know  that  under   the   clean\r\n\r\nleadership  of  our party, the P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\nthe anti-corruption movement has become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwidespread.   Contrasting   the   Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment with the P.A.P. dominated City  Council\r\n\r\nin   1957;  the  people  of  Singapore   saw   for\r\n\r\nthemselves that the City Council only could really\r\n\r\nprevent  corruption. The Lim Yew  Hock  Government\r\n\r\nalso  had  the work of eradicating corruption  but\r\n\r\nwithout  any result. Therefore, we can put  it  in\r\n\r\nthis way - in Singapore corruption once prevailed in\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Government have, since\r\n\r\nassuming  office  for  the  last  seven  or  eight\r\n\r\nmonths,   taken   positive  steps   to   eradicate\r\n\r\ncorruption.  We  have seen that  during  the  last\r\n\r\nelection campaign, the Singapore Improvement Trust\r\n\r\nwas   the  most  corrupt  Government  office.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore made this the object of our attack  when\r\n\r\nwe  came  into  office. We have taken  a  positive\r\n\r\nattitude towards the prevention of corruption. The\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are fully aware of this.  When\r\n\r\nthe  new  Government  began  working  on  the  old\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  they found that they  had  to  plug  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of  loopholes,  in  order  speedily   and\r\n\r\neffectively to prevent corruption. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nmoving  of the Second Reading of this Bill by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs is further proof that we\r\n\r\nare  determined  to  plug  the  loopholes  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and be in a better position  to  carry\r\n\r\nout our work of preventing corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see for yourself that\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, if there is to be prosperity, there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  clean  and efficient Government.  The\r\n\r\nmachinery in the Government offices must be clean,\r\n\r\nhonest  and dedicated to the service of the people\r\n\r\nand the country. If we have no good legislation to\r\n\r\ncarry  out these aims, that means that we have  no\r\n\r\nbetter  method  of eradicating the  previous  evil\r\n\r\npractices. I fully support the Bill introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended\r\n\r\nto  speak on this, because we have all agreed that\r\n\r\ncorruption  must  be eliminated,  and  because  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of principle is involved. But  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs, while he was moving\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading of the Bill, thought  it  was\r\n\r\npart  and parcel of the principle of the  Bill  to\r\n\r\nmention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  City Council in the past and during his time?\r\n\r\nI  am  sorry  that the Minister for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nexhibited  such  a  pathetic  ignorance   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of the City Council under  which  he\r\n\r\nworked and the constitution under which I worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the Council, I worked under the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance,  and  under  that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nleadership  of  the Council most definitely,  most\r\n\r\ncertainly,  and  most inexorably rested  with  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Council. He was a civil  servant.\r\n\r\nHe   was  the  leader  of  the  Council.  All  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  powers of the Council  were  vested  in\r\n\r\nhim,  and the Council merely assisted him  in  his\r\n\r\nwork.   Whereas,   under  the   Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  when  the Hon, the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs   was  in  the  Council  under  the   able\r\n\r\nleadership  of the Mayor (he is now  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development) who made such a good job\r\n\r\nof   the   City  Council,  things  were   entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent.  The  leadership under  that  Ordinance\r\n\r\npassed to the majority party, or the party,  which\r\n\r\ncould  command the confidence of the House.  Under\r\n\r\nthose  circumstances, the Hon, the Home Minister's\r\n\r\nthen  leader,  the Mayor, was the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  He  led  the Council, and  it  certainly\r\n\r\nwould have been correct to say that the leadership\r\n\r\nwas  with the Mayor. Leadership of the Council was\r\n\r\ncertainly  not with me when I was in the  Council,\r\n\r\nor  for that matter, Mr Speaker, when you were in\r\n\r\nthe Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the purpose of the Hon, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs in mentioning that fact  was  to\r\n\r\ntarnish  me with the brush, which he so  willingly\r\n\r\nand  so  readily seems to wield. But might  I  say\r\n\r\nthis  to  the  Hon, the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nthat  I  would  like to give him the  same  answer\r\n\r\nwhich  I  gave  to  his  ex-leader  once  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse - the remedy is entirely in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs, or should I have  said\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

At  the outset, I thought that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfrom the opposite side was not pleased to talk  on\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, because in pursuit of the discussions,\r\n\r\nprevious  unpleasant things in  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nmight be revealed to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

My  colleague  has\r\n\r\njust now indicated clearly the stand of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. We move this Bill with this purpose - to\r\n\r\nimplement     our    task    and    fulfil     our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, which were given to  us  by  the\r\n\r\nmass  of the people. Our desire is to satisfy  the\r\n\r\naspirations  of the people. That is  why  we  have\r\n\r\nsolemnly  introduced this Bill in  this  House.  I\r\n\r\npersonally support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not like to repeat the\r\n\r\npoints and arguments put up by my colleague. But I\r\n\r\nwould  like to tell the House what the P.A.P. did\r\n\r\nin  the general election. Mr Speaker, if you  had\r\n\r\ncome  to our mass rallies you would have seen  for\r\n\r\nyourself  that there were many brushes and  brooms\r\n\r\nat  our  meetings. All these brooms were presented\r\n\r\nto  us  by the people. This gesture signified  the\r\n\r\naspirations of the people because they  knew  that\r\n\r\nin  the Government under the leadership of Lim Yew\r\n\r\nHock, there was corruption everywhere and all  the\r\n\r\ntime. Therefore, when the P.A.P. took part in  the\r\n\r\nelection,  the people wanted a clean and effective\r\n\r\nGovernment to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput  in.  At  that time, we clearly accepted, the\r\n\r\naspirations and the demands of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today when we put this Bill before the House, our\r\n\r\npurpose is to make the aspirations of the people a\r\n\r\nreality. I do not like to go into details. What  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say is that I fully  support  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  strongly supports the Bill.

Therefore,  what\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  seeks to do is to prevent  such  things\r\n\r\nfrom  taking place. I do not think it can  totally\r\n\r\nbe prevented. This Bill is to see to it that there\r\n\r\nis  less  opportunity and less  freedom  for  such\r\n\r\nmalpractices being carried out. It is a Bill  that\r\n\r\nshould be fully supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is fond of saying, \"We are a clean\r\n\r\nParty. We are a clean Government.\" I would like to\r\n\r\ntell  them that it is not for them to' say whether\r\n\r\nthey  are clean or good. It is for others to  pass\r\n\r\njudgment.  If you are clean, the people will  know\r\n\r\nit.  If you are not clean, so will the people know\r\n\r\nit.  But  corruption,  Sir, is  not  only  illegal\r\n\r\ngratification.   There   are   other   forms    of\r\n\r\ncorruption,  and  I do not think  these  forms  of\r\n\r\ncorruption  are included in this Bill,  nor  could\r\n\r\nthey be prevented from being practised, even if we\r\n\r\nwere  to  amend  this  Bill.

I think the Minister will  accept\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to burden the\r\n\r\nHouse  with  much  of a statement  on  this.  The\r\n\r\nreport  has been before the House, and I take  it\r\n\r\nthat they have read the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill generally can be\r\n\r\ndivided into three sections. The first part of it\r\n\r\ndeals  with the giving of extended powers to  the\r\n\r\ninferior  Courts; the second part deals with  the\r\n\r\nadmission  of caution statements; and  the  third\r\n\r\npart  deals  with trials before  the  High  Court\r\n\r\nwithout  a  jury. Those are the three parts  into\r\n\r\nwhich the Bill could approximately be divided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  does not object to those  provisions,\r\n\r\nbut  feels  that in view of the present  staffing\r\n\r\nposition of the Courts, perhaps this is  not  the\r\n\r\nopportune moment to implement those provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as caution statements are concerned, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  here again the Opposition  feels\r\n\r\nthat  the  time  is  not ripe to  implement  that\r\n\r\nparticular aspect of this Bill. And  so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe third section is concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is, trials before the High Court without  a\r\n\r\njury,  the Opposition is entirely opposed to  the\r\n\r\nidea, and the Opposition feels that trials in the\r\n\r\nHigh Court before the jury should be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any other amendments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all those\r\n\r\nobservations  have been made by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park and by witnesses who appeared before\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee, and I do not  propose  to\r\n\r\nwaste any more time.

It  arose  during   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions in the Select Committee  on  the  new\r\n\r\nsection  54  that  we proposed  to  the  Evidence\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  At  the last meeting  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park raised\r\n\r\nan  objection  to the terms of clause  3  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  which amended section 54 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nHe maintained that under the provisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  sub-clause  (2) of the amendment  proposed  to\r\n\r\nsection  54  of the Ordinance, the accused  person\r\n\r\nwould  put his character in issue if either he  or\r\n\r\nhis  counsel were to impugn the character  of  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  witnesses,  and  would  therefore  be\r\n\r\nliable   to  cross-examination  as  to   his   own\r\n\r\ncharacter. The Member for Farrer Park then went on\r\n\r\nto  point  out further that, in his opinion,  once\r\n\r\nthe  accused had thereby put his own character  in\r\n\r\nissue,   there   was  nothing   to   prevent   the\r\n\r\nprosecution from giving independent evidence as to\r\n\r\nthe bad character of the accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that on that\r\n\r\noccasion I agreed that there appeared to  be  some\r\n\r\nmerit in what the Member for Farrer Park said, but\r\n\r\nsince  then  we have both had the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of the State Advocate-General who  pointed\r\n\r\nout that under the provisions of sub-clause (1) of\r\n\r\nthe amendment which we had overlooked then, it  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear that the prosecution would be stopped\r\n\r\nfrom  putting in independent evidence of  the  bad\r\n\r\ncharacter of the accused in circumstances where he\r\n\r\nis  cross-examined as to his own  character  after\r\n\r\nmaking   imputations  on  the  character  of   the\r\n\r\nprosecution   witnesses.  I  am  mentioning   this\r\n\r\ntonight, Mr Speaker, Sir, to complete the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also confirm that\r\n\r\nI  have had the benefit of consultations with  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General and the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law on this, and I am now satisfied that what\r\n\r\nI  said  in  the Select Committee was probably  an\r\n\r\nover-statement. It was not \"probably\", Sir; it was\r\n\r\nan overstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one observation, which I wish to\r\n\r\nmake  on the amendment to section 54, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. It is that the present amendment brings  our\r\n\r\nlaw  into  line  with the English system.  My  own\r\n\r\nview,  Mr Speaker, Sir, for what it is worth,  is\r\n\r\nthat  our  section,  as it  now  stands,  is  much\r\n\r\nsuperior to the English law on this. It is much in\r\n\r\nadvance of the English law, and English writers in\r\n\r\nEngland  have criticised the English  system,  and\r\n\r\nthey  wish to bring about the state of affairs  in\r\n\r\nEngland  which  we  already  have  it  now   here.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in my own view, this is  a  retrograde\r\n\r\nstep.  But the Minister does not think so, and  he\r\n\r\nhas   given   us  an  assurance  in   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee - you  may  remember  it,   Mr   Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir - that if the law in England is altered, then he\r\n\r\nwill most certainly give consideration to amending\r\n\r\nit  here.  With that assurance, I remain satisfied\r\n\r\nfor the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the\r\n\r\nHouse that once we have dealt effectively with the\r\n\r\nproblem  of gangsterism, we will be very happy  to\r\n\r\nfall  in  line with the new English  law  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now\r\n\r\nadjourn.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twelve minutes to Eight o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Wednesday, 2nd March, 1960.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
