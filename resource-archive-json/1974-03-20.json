Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I think it is\r\n\r\nnecessary   for  the  Member  to  appreciate   that\r\n\r\nnational  territorial  waters  are  very  jealously\r\n\r\nguarded by the nations that claim these waters.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  will  be  a number  of  international\r\n\r\nconferences held under the auspices of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  and developing countries of the  world  to\r\n\r\nresolve  law  of  the sea matters  arising  out  of\r\n\r\nterritorial  water claims. Therefore, the  proposal\r\n\r\nby the Member is not likely to be acceptable to the\r\n\r\nnations   concerned,  since  the   basic   problems\r\n\r\nunderlying  fishing rights have yet to be  resolved\r\n\r\nin the context of the law of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's suggestion that my\r\n\r\nMinistry   might  negotiate  with  the  governments\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  allow Singapore fishermen  to  enter\r\n\r\ntheir  territorial waters to fish, I wish to inform\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that this has already been tried.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development went even  further\r\n\r\nand  proposed payment of royalties to a  number  of\r\n\r\ncountries   where  our  fishermen   are   allegedly\r\n\r\nintruding  into their territorial waters  to  fish.\r\n\r\nThe response to such approaches, I am sorry to say,\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  favourable because of  defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  requirements.  There  are  also  problems\r\n\r\nrelating to piracy and the control of nationals  of\r\n\r\nthese  countries  fishing in their own  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government has failed to obtain an\r\n\r\nagreement  for licensing of Singapore fishermen  in\r\n\r\nsuch territorial waters, it might be perhaps better\r\n\r\nthat the applications by individuals to do so would\r\n\r\nbe  given  more  favourable  consideration,  and  I\r\n\r\npropose that the Member could take up this proposal\r\n\r\nwith the fishermen concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Examination of books and transactions)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  if  he  will  appoint  a  competent\r\n\r\nofficer  of his Ministry to thoroughly examine  the\r\n\r\nbooks and transactions of the Singapore Bus Service\r\n\r\n(Private)  Limited  before he authorises  bus  fare\r\n\r\nincreases; if he had caused such an examination  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  before  authorising  the  last  bus  fare\r\n\r\nincreases  on 10th February, 1974; and  if  he  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied  without  any doubts that  the  operating\r\n\r\nlosses of the company as reported were unavoidable,\r\n\r\ntrue and correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as explained in press\r\n\r\nstatements  issued by my Ministry on 3rd  and  20th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  and  in replies given by  me  to  recent\r\n\r\nQuestions  in  this  House, the bus  fare  revision\r\n\r\neffective from 10th February was allowed after  two\r\n\r\nreports were submitted in August and November  last\r\n\r\nyear   by   professional   management   consultants\r\n\r\ncommissioned  by Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.

Checking  and examination of books  of  these\r\n\r\nthree  companies were done by the auditors  of  the\r\n\r\nthree bus companies concerned.

In  addition,  my  officers  also  worked\r\n\r\nindependently  of  the reports  of  the  management\r\n\r\nconsultants on projected revenue and expenditure of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bus  Service Ltd, based  on  their  own\r\n\r\nsource  material. This was used as  an  independent\r\n\r\ncounter-check against the results of the management\r\n\r\nconsultants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these studies took several months and\r\n\r\ninvolved very detailed work. Actual examination  of\r\n\r\nthe books of the three former bus companies was not\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  my  officers  for  two  reasons  - firstly, there is no competent accounting staff  in the  Ministry  of Communications and, secondly,  it\r\n\r\nwould only have duplicated the work of the auditors\r\n\r\nof  these  companies. But the  bus  companies  had,\r\n\r\nnaturally, to convince me that a fare revision  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  also as to when the revision  would\r\n\r\nhave  to be effected, as well as how much it should\r\n\r\nhe, before approval for the revision was given.

Inaction would have brought about an\r\n\r\neven  worse  situation than the Singapore  Traction\r\n\r\nCompany because when STC, with a paid-up capital of\r\n\r\nover  $14  million,  folded up  bus  operations  in\r\n\r\nDecember, 1971, it had then an accumulated loss  of\r\n\r\n$9  million.  The  bus  fare  revision,  which  was\r\n\r\nauthorised on 10th February, 1974, and for which  I\r\n\r\nassume  full responsibility, was necessary for  SBS\r\n\r\nto be viable.

The first is on the\r\n\r\nquestion of smoky exhausts of taxis and, second, on\r\n\r\ntaxi stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received many complaints from taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers   who  complain  that  they  arc  receiving\r\n\r\nsummonses  from the Registry of Vehicles about  the\r\n\r\nsmoky  exhausts  of their taxis  and  the  fine  is\r\n\r\nusually  about S50. It is a heavy burden  on  them.\r\n\r\nThey  have  a  very limited monthly  income.  After\r\n\r\npaying the instalments and fuel costs, whatever  is\r\n\r\nleft is very limited, about $200 to S300. They have\r\n\r\nto  support their families with this meagre  income\r\n\r\nand  it  is not easy to do so. As a result  of  the\r\n\r\nendless  summonses  they  receive  and  the   fines\r\n\r\nimposed  on  them,  they are in a  very  distressed\r\n\r\nposition. Because of this, I realise that many taxi\r\n\r\noperators  have  resorted  to  getting  loans  from\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  at high interest. They  are  indebted\r\n\r\nand they deserve our sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers have also complained to me that they\r\n\r\nhave  frequently  been  summoned  to  the  ROV  for\r\n\r\ninspection  of their taxis by ROV officers  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether the engines are in order and whether  there\r\n\r\nis  any emission of smoke from the exhausts.  These\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers told me that they have to send  their\r\n\r\ntaxis to the ROV and it takes about one day for the\r\n\r\ninspection  to  he carried out. In this  way,  they\r\n\r\nlose one day's income. I do not understand why  the\r\n\r\ninspectors  at  the  ROV resort  to  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nsurprise inspections. According to the regulations,\r\n\r\nall  taxis  have to he inspected every  six  months\r\n\r\nbefore  they  are allowed to ply on the  roads.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is any fault with the engine, it has  to  be\r\n\r\nrepaired before approval is given for it to ply  on\r\n\r\nthe  roads.  Since  taxis are inspected  every  six\r\n\r\nmonths, I do not see any reason why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers should be asked to send their taxis to\r\n\r\nthe  ROV  for another inspection. This only results\r\n\r\nin the taxi drivers losing a day's income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is with regard to the setting up\r\n\r\nof  more taxi stands. Because of the drawing up  of\r\n\r\nthe  special bus lanes, the taxi stands along  many\r\n\r\nroads  have  been  abolished.  For  example,  along\r\n\r\nRobinson Road, Bras Basah Road, and Beach Road, the\r\n\r\ntaxi  stands have been removed and the taxi drivers\r\n\r\nare  experiencing difficulty in getting a place  to\r\n\r\npark  their  taxis. I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether it is possible to allow taxis  to\r\n\r\nmake use of the bus lanes to allow them to drop  or\r\n\r\npick up passengers. Since taxis are also a kind  of\r\n\r\npublic transport and they also provide an important\r\n\r\nservice   to  the  people,  I  think  it  is   only\r\n\r\nreasonable that they should be allowed to  use  the\r\n\r\nbus  lanes for the passengers to alight or  to  get\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the setting up of a taxi\r\n\r\nstand at the cable car terminal at Jardine Steps. I\r\n\r\nhave  received  a complaint from the  Taxi  Drivers\r\n\r\nAssociation  that it has applied to the  Car  Parks\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nfor permission to park taxis there. The application\r\n\r\nwas  recommended  by  the Association  hut  it  was\r\n\r\nrefused  by the Port of Singapore Authority because\r\n\r\nthe  area comes under the jurisdiction of the  PSA.\r\n\r\nSince  the  PSA  is  also  under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications, I would like the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nto  take note of this complaint by the Taxi Drivers\r\n\r\nAssociation and to direct the PSA to reconsider the\r\n\r\napplication for parking facilities at the cable car\r\n\r\nterminal.  Many people go to the cable car  complex\r\n\r\nand many taxis are plying at the terminal. If we do\r\n\r\nnot  provide  taxi drivers with taxi  stands,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to park their taxis.  They  will\r\n\r\nhave to park along the roadside, which will lead to\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion. For this, they will he ticketed\r\n\r\nby the Traffic Police, causing an additional burden\r\n\r\non  them.  So I would urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\ntheir case in a sympathetic manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis with regret that I rise to voice my criticism of\r\n\r\nthe  Registry  of  Vehicles.  Having  been  closely\r\n\r\nassociated   with   the  ROV,  I   understand   and\r\n\r\nappreciate the difficult working conditions of  its\r\n\r\nofficials and their inability to change or regulate\r\n\r\nsuch  working  conditions.  But,  nonetheless   the\r\n\r\nshortcomings of the ROV are too painfully  obvious.\r\n\r\nIt is my hope that the powers-that-be who are in  a\r\n\r\nposition   to   change  or  regulate  the   working\r\n\r\nconditions in the ROV would take note of  not  only\r\n\r\nthe  shortcomings but also the underlying cause  of\r\n\r\nsuch shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, for example, many things which, in my\r\n\r\nview,  the ROV can do or refrain from doing  so  as\r\n\r\nnot  to  make life unduly difficult for all persons\r\n\r\nseeking to earn a livelihood as taxi drivers.  Take\r\n\r\nthe  matter, for example, of the badges  which  all\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers must carry on their person to identify\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  licensed  taxi  drivers.  They  are\r\n\r\nrequired to pin their badges on their shirt-fronts.\r\n\r\nAs  I see it, the badges are worn for two purposes:\r\n\r\none  is  to assist enforcement against unauthorised\r\n\r\npersons  driving  taxis; the  other  is  to  enable\r\n\r\npassengers  to  identify taxi  drivers  who  offend\r\n\r\nthem.  None of the two purposes seems to have  been\r\n\r\nachieved. A taxi driver's badge does not in  itself\r\n\r\nindicate a particular person is so entitled to wear\r\n\r\nit.  The  ROV enforcement officer has to check  the\r\n\r\nidentity  card of the person wearing  it  with  the\r\n\r\nrecord  kept  in the office to confirm whether  the\r\n\r\nwearer  is  so  authorised to drive  a  taxi.  With\r\n\r\nseveral  thousand taxis on Singapore roads  at  any\r\n\r\none  time of the day and with more than 15,000 taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers on record, enforcement by the ROV has  been\r\n\r\npractically reduced to the ritual of enforcing  the\r\n\r\nwearing of badges of taxi drivers. Similarly,  with\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  drivers wearing badges on  their  shirt-fronts, it is difficult for passengers in the back-seat   of   taxis   to  read  the   badge   number,\r\n\r\nparticularly so at night. Experience has shown that\r\n\r\ncomplaining taxi passengers invariably identify the\r\n\r\ntaxis rather than the taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of requiring taxi drivers to wear badges, I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that every taxi driver be issued with\r\n\r\nan  identification card, similar to but larger than\r\n\r\nthe  laminated plastic identity card,  bearing  the\r\n\r\nphotograph,  name and identity card number  of  the\r\n\r\ndriver.  This identification card should be slotted\r\n\r\ninto  a  suitable  holder near the taxi-meter,  and\r\n\r\nilluminated at night so that the identification  of\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  for  any  purpose  should  offer  no\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  introduction of such  identification\r\n\r\ncard would do away with the ridiculous necessity of\r\n\r\ncharging taxi drivers with the technical offence of\r\n\r\nnot  wearing  their badges. It would  also  prevent\r\n\r\nunscrupulous taxi-owners from hiring their vehicles\r\n\r\nat higher rates to unlicensed persons who manage to\r\n\r\nget hold of badges to wear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too often easily forgotten by those persons\r\n\r\nresponsible for enforcing law and order  that  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  can  also  be  responsible  for  public\r\n\r\ndisrespect  towards  law and order.  Disrespect  is\r\n\r\ncreated  when  the  manner of enforcement  makes  a\r\n\r\nmockery  of  law and order. Take, for example,  the\r\n\r\nprosecution of taxi drivers for smoky exhaust.  Any\r\n\r\nfailure  to  maintain  engines  resulting  in   the\r\n\r\nunnecessary pollution of the atmosphere should,  by\r\n\r\nall  means, be severely prosecuted. There has  been\r\n\r\nan  increasing tendency, however, for summonses for\r\n\r\nsmoky  exhaust  to be indiscriminately  issued.  It\r\n\r\nseems  that if a police officer on duty spots  what\r\n\r\nseems to be a smoky exhaust, he issues a ticket  to\r\n\r\nthe driver of the offending taxi, requiring him  to\r\n\r\ntake the vehicle straightaway to the ROV depot  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory test for smoky exhaust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the ROV Department is one of the busiest\r\n\r\noffices in Singapore and the ROV officials, I  must\r\n\r\nstate,  are  generally hard pressed for  time.  All\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  dread the prospect of  having  their\r\n\r\nvehicles tested at the ROV depot for smoky exhaust.\r\n\r\nIt  means they have to be off the road for  several\r\n\r\nhours,  it  means their earnings for that  day  are\r\n\r\ndrastically reduced. And if they have  to  hire  or\r\n\r\npay  instalment on their taxis, it  adds  to  their\r\n\r\nburden. What makes it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworse  is  that more often than not the  officially\r\n\r\nconducted  test conclusively proves the  degree  of\r\n\r\nsmoke is under the acceptable level. The result  of\r\n\r\nthe  tests  is not surprising when it is considered\r\n\r\nthat  every  taxi  has  to  undergo  a  half-yearly\r\n\r\ninspection  by  the ROV. But the protests  of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  that their taxis have undergone the  half-yearly  inspection the day before or not  too  long\r\n\r\nago are ignored by the summoning police officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbing thought is that all police officers\r\n\r\nmust  have clear instructions to disregard the fact\r\n\r\nof  half-yearly  inspection when issuing  summonses\r\n\r\nfor  smoky  exhaust. The ugly implication  is  that\r\n\r\nsomeone  in  authority has serious  doubts  on  the\r\n\r\nintegrity,  honesty  or  competence  of   the   ROV\r\n\r\nofficials  in relation to the conduct of  thorough,\r\n\r\nproper  half-yearly  inspection  and  requires  the\r\n\r\npolice  force  to  serve as  a  balance  and  check\r\n\r\nagainst the ROV. Whether I am right or wrong in  my\r\n\r\nexplanation  of the policy governing the  issue  of\r\n\r\nsummonses  for smoky exhaust, I hope the  ROV  will\r\n\r\ncause to eliminate or minimise the element of human\r\n\r\nerror in the issue of summonses for smoky exhaust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge that human witnesses to\r\n\r\nthe same event or incident are unlikely to agree in\r\n\r\nevery  detail  on  what they have  seen.  A  police\r\n\r\nofficer,  who  is acquainted with the principle  of\r\n\r\ndiesel  engines, would know that all diesel engines\r\n\r\ngive  out  smoke when starting or accelerating  and\r\n\r\nwould   know  what  constitutes  an  unduly   smoky\r\n\r\nexhaust.  Another police officer may  construe  the\r\n\r\nslightest  sign  of smoke as constituting  a  smoky\r\n\r\nexhaust. I would, therefore, suggest that  the  ROV\r\n\r\nconduct for all police officers a practical  course\r\n\r\nof instruction on how to judge a smoky exhaust with\r\n\r\nnaked eyes. As it is, prosecution for smoky exhaust\r\n\r\nis becoming more and more like persecution. In some\r\n\r\ncases, taxi drivers are asked straightaway to pay a\r\n\r\ncompound fee for smoky exhaust without a test being\r\n\r\nconducted for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the danger of the routine nature\r\n\r\nof   official   duties  making   public   officials\r\n\r\nindifferent to the effect of any exercise of  their\r\n\r\npowers.  Such danger is illustrated by the reaction\r\n\r\nof  the  ROV  officials to the handing in  of  lost\r\n\r\nproperty   by  taxi  drivers.  They  ask  harassing\r\n\r\nquestions  of  taxi drivers such as, \"Why  did  you\r\n\r\nallow  passengers to leave their belongings  behind\r\n\r\nin  your taxi?\" \"Why did you not unwrap the  parcel\r\n\r\nto  check  whether the contents are valuable?\"  The\r\n\r\nimpression created is that the ROV does not wish to\r\n\r\nencourage  taxi  drivers to return  lost  property,\r\n\r\npresumably  because  of  the  additional  work   it\r\n\r\nentails   for  the  ROV  staff.  It  also  probably\r\n\r\nexplains why summonses are issued to call  in  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  for  routine clarification in  respect  of\r\n\r\nlost  property previously handed in. The effect  on\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  on  being served with  summonses  is\r\n\r\ndemoralising.  Their first thought  is  that  their\r\n\r\nexhaust is smoking too much and they have to  spend\r\n\r\nhard-earned   cash   on   unnecessary   repair   or\r\n\r\nadjustment  before keeping their  appointment  with\r\n\r\nthe  ROV. The question is why do the ROV officials,\r\n\r\nwho  by  now must be aware of the unpleasant effect\r\n\r\nof  summonses  on  taxi drivers,  continue  to  use\r\n\r\nsummonses for this purpose? If they must do so, why\r\n\r\ncannot  they clearly spell out the purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nSummonses?  I would hate to conclude that  the  ROV\r\n\r\nofficials   are   showing   a   could-not-care-less\r\n\r\nattitude  towards taxi drivers.  But  it  helps  to\r\n\r\nexplain  why  some  taxi  drivers  hand  over  lost\r\n\r\nproperty  to  newspaper  offices  where  they   can\r\n\r\nexpect, as least, appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the ROV officials, in common with other\r\n\r\npublic   officials,  have  good  cause  for   their\r\n\r\napparent  impatience with and suspicion of  members\r\n\r\nof  the public whom they come into contact with  in\r\n\r\nthe  course  of  their duty. It  explains  why  the\r\n\r\nofficials seem reluctant to consult members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  before  making decisions greatly  affecting\r\n\r\nthe  public. Take the matter, for example,  of  the\r\n\r\nadjustment to the taxi-meters following the  recent\r\n\r\ndecision  to  revise the taxi-fare  for  the  first\r\n\r\nmile. The ROV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficials were satisfied with consulting  only  six\r\n\r\ntaxi-meter   repairers.   In   return   for   their\r\n\r\nundertaking to adjust the meters of 5,000 taxis  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  two weeks, the ROV agreed  that  any\r\n\r\nadjustment of taxi-meter must be carried out within\r\n\r\nthe  specified  period of two weeks  and  that  the\r\n\r\nrecommended   rate   be  $40  per   meter.   Strong\r\n\r\nobjections were raised by taxi drivers to both  the\r\n\r\nlimited  period for adjustment and the  recommended\r\n\r\nrate. Once the ROV was convinced that the period is\r\n\r\ntoo   short,  and  the  restriction  to  only   six\r\n\r\nspecified  workshops  is unreasonable,  the  market\r\n\r\nrate  for adjustment of taxi-meters drops  down  to\r\n\r\nless  than one-third of the recommended rate. After\r\n\r\nall,  adjusting a taxi-meter does not require  more\r\n\r\nthan 15 minutes. The ROV officials would never have\r\n\r\nallowed  themselves to be misled by  the  workshop-owners  if  they had bothered to consult the  other\r\n\r\ninterested   parties,   that   is,   the    various\r\n\r\norganisations representing taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

If it  has  improved  the\r\n\r\ntraffic   flow,  has  the  ROV  any  intention   of\r\n\r\nintroducing  more  bus lanes along  all  major  bus\r\n\r\nroutes?  One setback against this new bus  lane  is\r\n\r\nthat  when the traffic lights change to green, cars\r\n\r\nwhich  are  turning left have to give  way  to  the\r\n\r\nbuses that are passing through the bus lanes.  This\r\n\r\nresults in a stretch of other vehicles coming to  a\r\n\r\nstandstill, until the car in front has  moved  off.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, cyclists find it risky to ride between\r\n\r\nthe  buses and the other vehicles.

This\r\n\r\napplies not only to taxis, but lorries as well.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of lorries there is also the problem  of\r\n\r\nchecking  on overloading. Once a lorry is suspected\r\n\r\nof overloading, it is ordered to go straight in for\r\n\r\nchecking.  In  a particular case, I was  told  that\r\n\r\nthis poor person pleaded with the staff of the  ROV\r\n\r\nto  speed up the checking so that he could  go  and\r\n\r\ndeliver  the  goods to the port, for loading  on  a\r\n\r\nship  which  was due to sail that very  night.

I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  what  it  has got  to  do  with  lorry\r\n\r\ndrivers,  because the lorry owner  is  a  different\r\n\r\nperson  altogether. The driver is paid on a  daily-rated basis.

You\r\n\r\nwill   remember,   Sir,  that  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications  has previously announced  that  the\r\n\r\nBSRC,   i.e, the   Bus  Services   Reorganisation\r\n\r\nCommittee, and the BSLA, the Bus Services Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority, are keeping a close supervision  on  bus\r\n\r\noperations, and in doing so they are acquiring  the\r\n\r\nnecessary expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have suggested better working\r\n\r\nconditions   for  the  bus  workers.  SILO,   which\r\n\r\nrepresents  the bus workers, is constantly  working\r\n\r\nto  improve  the  working  conditions  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers.  I would like to assure hon. Members  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry is always in sympathy with any measure\r\n\r\ntaken  to  improve  the working conditions  of  bus\r\n\r\nworkers.  Steps  are also being  taken  to  install\r\n\r\ncanteen  and  toilet facilities at  all  major  bus\r\n\r\ntermini.  Furthermore, with the  implementation  by\r\n\r\nthe  SBS  and SILO of an incentive scheme effective\r\n\r\nfrom  January,  1974, whereby $\ufffd million  would  be\r\n\r\npaid  every quarter to courteous and effective  bus\r\n\r\ncrew    members,   there   should   therefore    be\r\n\r\nconsiderable improvement in the morale and  in  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the bus workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah suggested the use of\r\n\r\nautomatic    transmission   and   power   steering.\r\n\r\nIntroduction  of automatic transmission  and  power\r\n\r\nsteering has been considered, but it was found  too\r\n\r\nexpensive for introduction at this stage.  However,\r\n\r\nhe  will be pleased to know that power steering  is\r\n\r\nnow part of the standard equipment of the new buses\r\n\r\nthat are being introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also suggested that\r\n\r\nsome  relief or soft loans to SBS be considered  to\r\n\r\nenable SBS to purchase new buses. The need has  not\r\n\r\narisen  as  SBS  has  no  problem  in  getting  the\r\n\r\nnecessary finance for the purchase of new buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion that notice boards\r\n\r\ndisplaying bus routes be put up at bus termini  and\r\n\r\nat  bus  stops.  This  matter is  actually  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess   of   being  implemented  at   the   major\r\n\r\nterminals,  and  at  a later  stage  will  also  be\r\n\r\nimplemented at major bus stops. At the  moment  the\r\n\r\nbuses   do  carry  route  numbers  and  destination\r\n\r\npoints.  I  can assure Members that other  measures\r\n\r\nwill  be introduced for the greater convenience  of\r\n\r\ncommuters in due course of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked whether it was fair\r\n\r\nto  use  taxpayers' money to provide bus lanes  for\r\n\r\nbuses  only. I presume that the Member is  assuming\r\n\r\nthat  bus commuters are not taxpayers as well.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of the reserved bus lanes is to provide  a\r\n\r\nsmooth  flow  of  bus traffic in order  that  large\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people  can travel  speedily  from  one\r\n\r\ndestination to another in the course of their daily\r\n\r\nactivity  during peak hours. This is vital  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy of our country. It is, therefore, a  proper\r\n\r\nuse  of public money to reserve bus lanes for buses\r\n\r\nduring  peak hours, and besides the bus  lanes  are\r\n\r\nonly operative during a few hours each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion that the punishment of\r\n\r\nconfiscation  of vehicles on the third  offence  is\r\n\r\ntoo  severe,  I  would like  to  say  that  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered a necessary deterrent in order to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  bus  lanes are free for smooth  flow  of  bus\r\n\r\ntraffic during peak hours. Otherwise the purpose of\r\n\r\nbus lanes would be defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also raised the question of\r\n\r\na  minimum fare of 10 cents instead of 20 cents.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to refer him to two previous statements\r\n\r\nreleased  by  the  Ministry on  the  3rd  and  20th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1974, where adequate reasons were  given.\r\n\r\nAnd   only  a  few  days  ago,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications also touched on this  point  in  his\r\n\r\nreply  to  an  Oral Question. I need not  elaborate\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang and Jurong also\r\n\r\nsuggested the use of 14-seater mini-buses. I am not\r\n\r\nquite sure whether they mean just the participation\r\n\r\nof these buses in the supplementary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransport  service which we have at the moment,  or\r\n\r\nthey  are thinking of an entirely new supplementary\r\n\r\ntransport system involving 14-seater mini-buses. At\r\n\r\nthe moment we do have a few small buses taking part\r\n\r\nin  the  supplementary transport  system,  and  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  using a different  system  of  14-seater  mini-buses for passengers commuting  within\r\n\r\nfive  miles of the City centre will be referred  to\r\n\r\nthe BSRC for their consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied mentioned that there was\r\n\r\nonly one qualified engineer and a few assistants to\r\n\r\nservice a fleet of 2,000 buses. This is only partly\r\n\r\ntrue. The SBS has one qualified engineer but a very\r\n\r\nlarge number of technical assistants to help in the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of a fleet of 2,000 buses. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nSBS  also contracts out work to motor workshops for\r\n\r\nrepairs  and'  other services. At  the  moment,  37\r\n\r\ntrainees are undertaking a special training  scheme\r\n\r\norganised by SBS in conjunction with the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board, the ROV and SILO, and they are on a\r\n\r\nthree-month attachment to Progress Motors and Cycle\r\n\r\nand Carriage, which are the main suppliers of buses\r\n\r\nto SBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir asked whether monthly\r\n\r\ntickets  could be obtained at other places  besides\r\n\r\nChangi. The Member will be pleased to know that SBS\r\n\r\nis  getting  some expert advice on a programme  for\r\n\r\nwider distribution of such season tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked when the motor\r\n\r\ninsurance  bureau  would be  set  up.  The  present\r\n\r\nposition is that discussions on the setting up of a\r\n\r\nmotor insurance bureau have been going on for quite\r\n\r\nsome  time  between the Insurance Commissioner  and\r\n\r\nthe  insurance industry, and they are now  reaching\r\n\r\nthe final stages of their discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may come back to some of the questions\r\n\r\nraised  just  now. Regarding the fines  imposed  on\r\n\r\ntaxis  with smoky exhausts, I would like to  inform\r\n\r\nMembers of the House that the fines are imposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police. As taxis are  public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nvehicles are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperly  maintained  and  kept  in  good   working\r\n\r\ncondition. For this reason, half-yearly inspections\r\n\r\nfor  any mechanical deficiency or body defects  are\r\n\r\nbeing made. These measures are taken to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles are in a roadworthy condition. On the\r\n\r\nquestion of surprise inspections of smoky exhausts,\r\n\r\nthis  is  done  to  make  sure  that  vehicles  are\r\n\r\nmaintained in good condition at all times, and  not\r\n\r\njust   for   the  sake  of  having  them   checked.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is necessary that inspections on  the\r\n\r\nspot   should  be  made  besides  this  half-yearly\r\n\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Aljunied has any definite case\r\n\r\nof   intimidation  or  undue  harassment  of   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers,  I  would  be pleased  to  look  into  the\r\n\r\nmatter. However, I can assure him that the officers\r\n\r\nare only doing their duty, not for any other reason\r\n\r\nbut  to  ensure  that these vehicles  do  not  emit\r\n\r\nexcessive smoke from their exhausts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion by him that taxis\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to use bus lanes either to  drop\r\n\r\nor  to  pick up passengers. This request cannot  be\r\n\r\ngranted because it would defeat the very purpose of\r\n\r\ncreating  bus  lanes  which  is  to  expedite   the\r\n\r\nmovement of buses during the peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that taxi stops along certain bus\r\n\r\nroutes have been removed to make way for bus lanes.\r\n\r\nIn  actual  fact,  taxis are  shy  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness   District  during  peak  hours   because,\r\n\r\nfinding the traffic a little heavy there they would\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to make as many trips as  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  liked.  Concerning the  taxi  stands  at  the\r\n\r\nterminal  for  cable cars, we will look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter. If there is space or if there is a need for\r\n\r\nit, then there might be a possibility of putting up\r\n\r\na taxi stand there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has suggested that the\r\n\r\nROV  issues  identification cards with  photographs\r\n\r\nand  names of taxi drivers. I think this is a  good\r\n\r\nsuggestion and we will look into it. And if he  can\r\n\r\nalso provide me with definite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  where the ROV discourages taxi drivers  from\r\n\r\nreturning  lost property or creates undue hindrance\r\n\r\nto  their  wish to have lost property  returned,  I\r\n\r\nwill personally look into the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the taxi-meter adjustment, originally\r\n\r\nsix   workshops  were  included  in  the  list   of\r\n\r\nworkshops  where  taxi-meters can  be  adjusted  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the revised taxi fares. Members may\r\n\r\nwish  to  know  that these six workshops  were  the\r\n\r\nworkshops  that the taxi drivers had patronised  in\r\n\r\nthe past in the previous meter adjustment exercise.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they were automatically included in  the\r\n\r\nlist.  The  introduction  of  a  schedule  for  the\r\n\r\nadjustment of meters was necessary in order to have\r\n\r\nan  orderly  process  for the inspection  of  these\r\n\r\nadjusted   meters.  Later,  more   workshops   were\r\n\r\nincluded in the list because the six workshops were\r\n\r\ncharging  $40  per meter adjustment, and  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  thought that was too high. The reason  for\r\n\r\ncharging $40 was that the workload was such that it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary  to employ skilled workers  to  work\r\n\r\nover-time   in   order   to  make   the   necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments within the scheduled time. However, the\r\n\r\nschedule  has been relaxed and more workshops  have\r\n\r\nbeen  included  in the list and, I  am  sure,  this\r\n\r\nproblem has resolved itself satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has raised the question\r\n\r\nof   delay  in  the  examination  of  vehicles  for\r\n\r\nexhausts and for overloading. If we do not have  as\r\n\r\nmany  vehicles emitting black smoke as we have now,\r\n\r\nthe  workload  would have been  less  and  speedier\r\n\r\nexamination could be carried out. But if  there  is\r\n\r\nany   case  where  undue  delay  has  come  to  his\r\n\r\nattention,  I  would be much obliged  if  he  would\r\n\r\nrefer the case to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the vehicles turning left,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  raised  by the Member  for  Anson,  the\r\n\r\nMember's problem is the difficulty of cars  turning\r\n\r\nleft  when  there  is a bus lane on  the  left-hand\r\n\r\nside. He will notice that all the bus lanes end  at\r\n\r\na  certain distance from a road junction  or  where\r\n\r\nthere  is a slip-turn. Therefore, a little  bit  of\r\n\r\ncare  need  to  be exercised before  he  makes  the\r\n\r\nnecessary turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I happened to be in the House when the Member for Toa Payoh raised his\r\n\r\nquestions,  perhaps I can now take  over  from  my\r\n\r\nMinister of State and answer the two points raised\r\n\r\nby him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the name of the private motor repairer\r\n\r\nresponsible for repairing 400 buses of the SBS  is\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Automotive Engineers,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of MINDEF. At the time when they signed\r\n\r\nthe  contract, they were not aware  that  the  400\r\n\r\nbuses  would be in such a bad state that it  would\r\n\r\ntake a very long time to repair them. So up to the\r\n\r\nmoment  I  believe they have been able  to  repair\r\n\r\nonly  50 buses, although they had hoped to be able\r\n\r\nto  repair the 400 buses by April of this year.  I\r\n\r\nthink,  in a previous Oral Answer, I had indicated\r\n\r\nthat  it might take a bit longer for the 400 buses\r\n\r\nof the SBS to be repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second question about various\r\n\r\nconnections  of repairers with the SBS  directors,\r\n\r\netc.,  I  am  afraid, Sir, he  is  anticipating  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which the Member for Kallang has  tabled\r\n\r\nfor answer on Monday. Instead of repeating answers\r\n\r\nto  Members, perhaps he could be a little bit more\r\n\r\npatient.  It will be on Monday, the 25th,  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  days from now, when I will answer the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Kallang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I promised hon. Members, who were present\r\n\r\nin this House last night, that I would be making a\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  today,  with  a  new  angle  on\r\n\r\nreorganisation of Road Transport,  other  than  on\r\n\r\nbuses,  on  which  subject many have  agreed  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  already an overdose, with hon.  Members\r\n\r\nrepeating  tediously what had  been  said  earlier\r\n\r\n-almost like flogging a dead horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding, however, with my new subject,\r\n\r\nmay   I  be  permitted  to  place  on  record   my\r\n\r\nappreciation  for the patience, understanding  and\r\n\r\nmaturity  of our long-suffering bus commuters  and\r\n\r\nthat I pledge to put our public bus service right,\r\n\r\nsoonest possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Bus Service Ltd (SBS) buses\r\n\r\noperated  on Sunday, 10th February, 1974,  without\r\n\r\nany incident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatsoever,  the day the revised  bus  fares  came\r\n\r\ninto  operation,  Singapore  stood  proud  by  its\r\n\r\npeople,  especially the hundreds of  thousands  of\r\n\r\nbus  commuters in having to pay more when the  bus\r\n\r\nservices   as  operated  by  SBS  fell  short   of\r\n\r\nexpectations,  especially  during  peak   periods,\r\n\r\nwithout  resorting to riots or  burning  of  buses\r\n\r\nwhich  irate commuters elsewhere do when fares  go\r\n\r\nup,  be  it  in Hong Kong, or cities in  India  or\r\n\r\nPakistan. Ours are a law-abiding people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we became independent in 1965 (nine years\r\n\r\nago), we as a people have been constantly learning\r\n\r\nthe hard lesson that nobody owes us a living, that\r\n\r\nnothing  is for free, as being without any natural\r\n\r\nresources  but  human resources we  have  to  work\r\n\r\nhard,  to earn our keep and pay for everything  we\r\n\r\nneed, even necessities for life, like food, water,\r\n\r\nclothing, transport, etc. Water is for free.  When\r\n\r\nthe  rain  comes, you could open  your  mouth  and\r\n\r\ndrink  it.  But  you still have to pay  for  water\r\n\r\nbecause  it has got to be processed, and  millions\r\n\r\nof dollars have to be spent on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus commuters are in the best position to know\r\n\r\nhow  the rising cost of living over the past  year\r\n\r\nhas  eroded into their daily or monthly income and\r\n\r\nare,  therefore, able to understand and sympathise\r\n\r\nwith  the plight of 9,000 workers of SBS who  have\r\n\r\nto  perform a hard and onerous job and hard-put to\r\n\r\nprovide   for   their   families,   under   trying\r\n\r\nconditions. It was, therefore, my first concern to\r\n\r\nensure  that  SBS must improve on  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of its workers even before SBS  started\r\n\r\noperations  on  1st  November,  1973.  I  can  now\r\n\r\ndisclose  that SBS was not prepared  to  make  any\r\n\r\nwage  increase  in  November, 1973,  because  that\r\n\r\nwould  immediately put its operations in the  red.\r\n\r\nBut  I  advised and prevailed on SBS to  make  the\r\n\r\ngesture  of  a wage increase, so that its  workers\r\n\r\ncan  see that they are benefiting materially  with\r\n\r\nthe  formation of SBS. We must first raise  morale\r\n\r\nbefore  we  can enforce discipline  and  call  for\r\n\r\nbetter performance from workers. That was how  the\r\n\r\n60 cents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  day increase came into effect on 1st November,\r\n\r\n1973,  besides  an incentive scheme costing  SBS  a\r\n\r\nfurther  sum of $1 million per annum to be operated\r\n\r\nby SILO, on behalf of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the $25 per month additional wage\r\n\r\nsupplement   recommended  by  the  National   Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil,  which was made applicable to SBS  workers\r\n\r\nas  from the 1st of February (last month), and I am\r\n\r\npleased  to  hear from none other than the  General\r\n\r\nSecretary  of SILO, a valuable member  of  the  Bus\r\n\r\nServices  Reorganisation Committee  and  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  for  Boon  Teck,  who  confirmed  at  a\r\n\r\ntelevision  feature one week ago and  yesterday  in\r\n\r\nParliament  that  SBS workers, on the  whole,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  a  very good deal  in  that  with  the\r\n\r\nformation of SBS, each worker got no less than  $40\r\n\r\nper  month extra, all within a short space of  four\r\n\r\nmonths,   which  is  not  what  other  workers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore can hope to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the BSRC will monitor and supervise the\r\n\r\noperations of SBS, it is my confident hope that the\r\n\r\npublic  bus  service will be seen to  improve  with\r\n\r\ntime,  as we tackle other aspects of Road Transport\r\n\r\nreorganisation, in earnest. New hornets' nests will\r\n\r\nbe  stirred!  In  what direction will  this  arise?\r\n\r\nIncreasing restraints on the use of 137,000 private\r\n\r\ncars  during peak hours and that is what I wish  to\r\n\r\ndwell upon at some length, now. And Members will be\r\n\r\nspeaking on their own behalf after this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier Oral Answer in this House, I had\r\n\r\nindicated  that any attempt to improve  our  public\r\n\r\nbus  service  cannot  be  successful,  if  made  in\r\n\r\nisolation, and we must at the same time tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  increasing  traffic  congestion.   The\r\n\r\nformation  of  the Road Transport Action  Committee\r\n\r\n(RTAC)  in  November last is the weapon  to  ensure\r\n\r\nhigh  priority  for the public bus service  on  our\r\n\r\nlimited  road  space and to launch a  multi-pronged\r\n\r\nattack on traffic congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the problem we have to overcome?

I can do no better  than  to\r\n\r\nprovide  this House with a diagram of the peak-hour\r\n\r\ntravel pattern (typical of a week-day) which exists\r\n\r\nin  Singapore today. I shall now hand over  to  the\r\n\r\nClerk  of  Parliament copies of  the  diagram* for distribution to Members.\r\n\r\n(* See Appendix, cols. 525-6.)<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19740320/19740320-HA-0330525.pdf\"\">Total Transport Trips by time of day (Cols. 525-526)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies handed in to the Clerk and distributed to Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagram in Members' hands was produced by our\r\n\r\nMass  Transit Study Unit and forms part of the many\r\n\r\ndiagrams  attached to the draft Final Report  (June\r\n\r\n1973) of the Singapore Mass Transit Study, Phase I,\r\n\r\nwhich I had occasion to refer to yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, \"A picture speaks more than a\r\n\r\nthousand words\". Most cities of the world have only\r\n\r\ntwo  peak-hour travel periods (morning peak from  7\r\n\r\nto  9  a.m, and the evening peak from 5 to 7 p.m.).\r\n\r\nWe  in Singapore have three peak periods, i.e, the\r\n\r\naddition  of  a  midday peak because  most  of  our\r\n\r\nprimary schools operate on two sessions-morning and\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diagram of Total Transport Trips by time of\r\n\r\nday  made up of work trips, school trips and  other\r\n\r\ntrips  was  drawn  up  after  the  State  and  City\r\n\r\nPlanning   Department  carried  out  a  survey   to\r\n\r\ndetermine household trip-making characteristics  of\r\n\r\n12,500  households over a period of six  months  in\r\n\r\n1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic jams and frustrations we face in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today are essentially those  encountered\r\n\r\nduring  peak-hour travel. Unless changed, which  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided  will be done and the sooner  the  to\r\n\r\ndetermine household trip-making more congestion  on\r\n\r\nour limited road space. The business and industrial\r\n\r\nactivities  on  which we depend for our  livelihood\r\n\r\nwould  then be forced to a slower and slower  pace,\r\n\r\nultimately coming to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of travel will also increase if trips\r\n\r\nmade  during  peak-hour periods  are  not  reduced.\r\n\r\nThese   costs,   which  we  shall   call   \"traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion costs\", cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   the  individual  such  as  increased  cost  of\r\n\r\noperation   and  increased  stress  and   emotional\r\n\r\ntension,  and  social  costs  like  air  pollution,\r\n\r\naccidents,  noise  and  the  undesirable  aesthetic\r\n\r\neffects   of   congested   streets   and   parking.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to  resolve  our  problem  of   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion, we need to attack the problem along two\r\n\r\nfronts: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to spread (and thus reduce) peak-hour travel\r\n\r\ndemand, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to reduce the number of private vehicles on\r\n\r\nthe roads during peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peak-hour travel demand can be reduced if all\r\n\r\ntrips,  other  than work or school trips  are  made\r\n\r\noutside the peak periods. One way of spreading peak-hour  travel  is  by introducing staggered  working\r\n\r\nhours.  From  January  this  year,  Government  and\r\n\r\nStatutory Boards have introduced staggered  working\r\n\r\nhours  for their staff, if only for a trial  period\r\n\r\nof  six months. This has resulted in the following:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n Working Hours:\r\n\r\n 0800 to 1630 hours  ... 44%\r\n\r\n 0830 to 1700 hours  ... 51%\r\n\r\n 0900 to 1730 hours  ...  4%\r\n\r\n 0930 to 1800 hours  ...  1%\r\n\r\n                         ----\r\n\r\n                         100%\r\n\r\n                         ====\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the civil servant population constitutes only\r\n\r\nabout  10  per cent of the total working population\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  it  is necessary that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector should also adopt staggered working hours to\r\n\r\nhave any significant effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of car pools will not only save\r\n\r\nfuel   but   will   also  greatly  reduce   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.  This was stressed by me,  Sir,  at  an\r\n\r\nearlier  Oral  Answer. The insurance  industry  has\r\n\r\nassured  vehicle owners participating in car  pools\r\n\r\nthat   the   insurance  policies   would   not   be\r\n\r\ninvalidated under the present terms of these  motor\r\n\r\ninsurance policies. It is now up to vehicle  owners\r\n\r\nto   take  up  this  offer  to  help  ease  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion during peak periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure which employers in the private\r\n\r\nsector  can help is to arrange for group transport,\r\n\r\nlike Scheme A of the Supplementary Public Transport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService  (SPTS),  or Adult Workers  Contract  (AWC)\r\n\r\nvehicles, whether of buses or lorries. Yet  another\r\n\r\nalternative would be for the employers to  own  and\r\n\r\noperate these vehicles themselves, i.e, to form  an\r\n\r\nemployers' supplementary public transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures have been and will continue to be taken\r\n\r\nto   provide   an  adequate  public  bus   service,\r\n\r\nsupplemented  where necessary with  other  feasible\r\n\r\nforms  of public or group transport. However,  a  a\r\n\r\npublic  transport system cannot operate efficiently\r\n\r\nif  it  is not protected from the congestion caused\r\n\r\nby  private  cars in central areas, on high-density\r\n\r\nroutes  and  in peak-hour traffic. If  the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion cannot be eased through voluntary means,\r\n\r\nsuch  as staggered work-hours and the formation  of\r\n\r\ncar  pools, then physical constraints will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  to obtain a mandatory  change.  The\r\n\r\nintroduction of reserved bus lanes is one  step  in\r\n\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In plain language, the priority of movement of\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles in our limited road space will be as\r\n\r\nfollows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                            Public \r\n\r\n                                           Vehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Public Buses (SBS)                       2,000\r\n\r\n(2) Supplementary Public Transport\r\n\r\n       - during Peak Hours only:\r\n\r\n    Scheme B (PT) licences -\r\n\r\n        School Buses 600*   }\r\n\r\n        Lorries      400    }              1,000\r\n\r\n    Scheme A - (Adult Workers  Contract)   1,000*\r\n\r\n(3) School buses (*include \r\n\r\n        Scheme B & AWC) (say)              2,000*\r\n\r\n(4) Taxis                                  5,000\r\n\r\n                                          ------\r\n\r\n                                          10,000\r\n\r\n                                          ======\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Private cars - 137,000\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words,  all  the 10,000  public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles responsible for group\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntravel will be given higher priority and precedence\r\n\r\nin  the use of limited road space during peak-hours\r\n\r\nover 137,000 private cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been announced that a study is\r\n\r\nunderway   to  consider  a  park-and-ride   scheme,\r\n\r\nwhereby  commuters could park their cars in  fringe\r\n\r\ncar parks and take a shuttle bus into or out of the\r\n\r\nCentral Business District during peak periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, measures to curb the rise in private\r\n\r\ncar ownership are also under study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not alone in this battle against peak-hour\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion.

In\r\n\r\norder  to  encourage staggered work-hours  and  car\r\n\r\npools,   we  are  planning  to  launch  a  National\r\n\r\nCampaign  to drive home the need for such voluntary\r\n\r\nrestraints. A meeting will be called in  July  this\r\n\r\nyear  (after  the 20 busy streets  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness  District  have  reserved  bus  lanes   in\r\n\r\noperation)  to  drive home the problems  associated\r\n\r\nwith  peak-hour travel and to actively promote  the\r\n\r\nstaggering  of work-hours and car-pooling  schemes.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from Government agencies, transport\r\n\r\noperators, organisations in the private sector  and\r\n\r\nroad  users will be invited. It is hoped this would\r\n\r\nhelp bring about an extensive adoption of staggered\r\n\r\nwork-hours and formation of car pools in an  effort\r\n\r\nto  voluntarily change the pattern of present peak-hour travel and thus help reduce overall congestion\r\n\r\non our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make 1974 the year in which we voluntarily\r\n\r\nmake  an  effort  to change our  travel  pattern  - namely,   to  avoid  peak-hour  travel.  Why   must\r\n\r\neverybody  travel  at the same  time?  It  is  most\r\n\r\ninteresting to watch. All of us are affected.  When\r\n\r\nwe  have  a traffic jam, we always blame the  other\r\n\r\nperson,  \"Why do you not stay away?\" But  we  never\r\n\r\nask  ourselves: Why are we contributing to the  jam\r\n\r\nand  to the frustration? It is in the hands of  the\r\n\r\n137,000 private car owners to make it possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, who knows, if we succeed in doing what we attempt to achieve - to reduce peak-hour travel - we may be able to reach the happy prospect drawn by Dr Wilfred Owen in his Study - page 64 - of avoiding the heavy cost of spending billions of dollars to build a subway for Singapore. I think my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance, will be the happiest man in-deed. Dr  Owen\r\n\r\nwas  analysing the problem of building a subway  in\r\n\r\nan oil-rich city of Caracas, Venezuela:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The success of the subway, therefore, will\r\n\r\ndepend on improved bus transport and on measures to\r\n\r\nrestrict  automobiles to the  extent  necessary  to\r\n\r\nenable the feeder bus system to operate. But if  it\r\n\r\nis   politically   feasible   to   introduce   such\r\n\r\nrestrictions with the subway, an alternative  might\r\n\r\nbe  to  restrict car use without subway. The  money\r\n\r\nsaved could be used to provide a system of buses on\r\n\r\nexclusive  bus streets, fares could be considerably\r\n\r\nlower than for the subway, and automobiles could be\r\n\r\nconfined  to areas outside the centre and  to  off-peak  hours.  The  cost  of  the  subway  could  be\r\n\r\navoided,  and  the  resources used  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\ncritical  housing conditions that compel one-fourth\r\n\r\nof the population to live in squatter settlements.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  course,  Caracas  may  not  have  solved  their\r\n\r\nhousing  problem.

Anyway,  the  dialogue  has  been  very\r\n\r\nvaluable, and since the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nhas given a pledge that he will solve the transport\r\n\r\nproblem,  I  believe we should all be  patient  and\r\n\r\nwait for the outcome of the measures to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this: is it envisaged that private\r\n\r\nvehicles will be restricted or barred from entering\r\n\r\nthe business centre? If so, when is it expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  enforced?  Anyway,  we all  have  debated  very\r\n\r\nthoroughly the transport situation right  now,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore I believe we should have a moratorium.

The way he said it by quoting\r\n\r\nthe  oil-rich country, Caracas, Venezuela, that  by\r\n\r\ndoing  away with their subway they were saving  the\r\n\r\nmoney  for other purposes, are we going to do  away\r\n\r\nwith MRT as a result of this restriction on private\r\n\r\ncars coming into the City during peak hours? And is\r\n\r\nhe trying to get away from the fact that perhaps we\r\n\r\nneed  MRT,  if  not  now, in the future?  Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister please answer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> You will recall, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I paid the Minister a compliment yesterday for\r\n\r\nhis   eloquence.  Today,  after  listening  to  his\r\n\r\nstatement, I must say that he is also a strategist.\r\n\r\nThe  restriction of use of private cars during peak\r\n\r\nhours is a fairly controversial matter. But then to\r\n\r\nintroduce  it after a lot of grouses from  the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters  would put the private car  owners  in  a\r\n\r\nspot  which  makes them very difficult  to  grouse,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  will  not  only  be  taking  on  the\r\n\r\nCommunications  Minister but the bus  commuters  as\r\n\r\nwell.  I  would like to go along and see that  this\r\n\r\nscheme  works, for the simple reason that  if  this\r\n\r\ndoes not work worse things will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to say one thing about what the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  in the first part of his  statement\r\n\r\nconcerning his concern for the welfare and the well-being of the bus workers. I would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity,   because  I   have   never   had   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  publicly,  to bear  testimony  to  the\r\n\r\nstatement  that  he has made. I, together  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  the leadership of  the  former  STC\r\n\r\nunion and the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere very much involved in the funeral rites, so to\r\n\r\nspeak,  of the former STC, and the question of  the\r\n\r\nplight of the bus workers in the former STC. I  had\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to witness the concern and  plight\r\n\r\nthese workers were in when they were faced with the\r\n\r\nprospect of retrenchment. For the Minister  to  put\r\n\r\npressure  on  the Chinese bus companies  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntheir  continued employment, I think, was something\r\n\r\nwhich nobody could see hut which meant a great deal\r\n\r\nto  those  workers and their families. I  know  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  have a hard time dealing  with  the\r\n\r\ntransport problems in Singapore. He will have brick-bats thrown at him and I would probably join others\r\n\r\nin  throwing brick-bats at him on things  that  are\r\n\r\nnot  right. But my conscience will not be clear  if\r\n\r\npraise is due but not given. I wish it to be placed\r\n\r\non  record  that the part he played  is  recognised\r\n\r\nparticularly  by  the  former  STC  employees   who\r\n\r\nsecured continued employment. I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  share  with  me the  sentiments  I  had\r\n\r\nexpressed.  This is the little comfort I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will have to help him in the  tough  time\r\n\r\nahead of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, being a\r\n\r\nMember  on  the  Government side, it  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult for me to join Members, the Backbenchers,\r\n\r\nin  some of the views they have expressed though  I\r\n\r\nwould go a small way to agree with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister today has given a wonderful\r\n\r\nperformance. The problem as I see it, Sir, is not a\r\n\r\nproblem  of  buses, bus services or  commuters.  We\r\n\r\nmust  take the problem in a wider context. We  call\r\n\r\nit  a traffic problem, but some Members said it  is\r\n\r\nthe \"transportation problem\". So it is not buses or\r\n\r\ncommuters. The problem is that we should  dwell  on\r\n\r\nit  at  that level. I think we should delve  deeper\r\n\r\ninto  the problem, that is, transportation, traffic\r\n\r\npattern,  and  how it affects the society  and  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  I  think we should look at  the  question\r\n\r\nwith more depth and see a little bit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther beyond the horizon than the rear of the bus\r\n\r\nexhaust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not without some reservation that I\r\n\r\nstand  up  to  speak.  I agree  entirely  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  on the statistics and examples  which  he\r\n\r\nquoted.  His  officers have dealt with this  matter\r\n\r\nfor  several years now and I was told that some  of\r\n\r\nthem even have got degrees on Road Engineering  and\r\n\r\nTraffic.  Sir, I must confess to the House  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  got  that kind of qualification,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  does  not  prevent  me  from  speaking\r\n\r\nobjectively on the problem. Perhaps a layman  might\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  see the whole situation in  a  better\r\n\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, I cannot remember exactly when, I\r\n\r\nspoke  briefly in this House about the question  of\r\n\r\nthe  Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Some  Members\r\n\r\nthink   that  the  MRT  might  solve  our   traffic\r\n\r\nproblems. Even if the MRT can solve our problem,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a long-term project, because even if we\r\n\r\napprove it today in this very House, it will take a\r\n\r\nminimum of five to eight years for the whole system\r\n\r\nto  be completed. By then, as the Minister has said\r\n\r\nearlier,   the  pattern  of  development,  concept,\r\n\r\nprinciple, and data on which the MRT is mooted will\r\n\r\nbe  so much changed. You will remember, Sir, in the\r\n\r\nold  Master Plan, the idea of the flyover from  Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  Road  to  China  Street  in  town  was  first\r\n\r\nconceived  as  early as 1956. That flyover  is  not\r\n\r\nthere  today  because  the situation  has  entirely\r\n\r\nchanged.  I  said sometime ago that if we  want  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  MRT it must at least conform  to  a  few\r\n\r\nprinciples.  I will repeat what I said earlier.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be fast enough, it must be cheap enough,  and\r\n\r\nit  must not interfere with the surface traffic. It\r\n\r\nmust also not be a source of pollution, whether  it\r\n\r\nis noise or air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would imagine, Sir, quoting the figures I\r\n\r\ngathered from the newspaper, that the MRT will cost\r\n\r\nanything  between $500 million and $1,000  million.\r\n\r\nAt  current  prices, I will put it at  around  $750\r\n\r\nmillion, may be even $850 million. Let us take  the\r\n\r\nminimum figure and, say, three years from now, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplement  this system. This $500 million  includes\r\n\r\nthe  possible  fluctuation upwards in three  years'\r\n\r\ntime.  If we put this money in the bank, we get  an\r\n\r\ninterest of $50 million a year. With this money, we\r\n\r\ncan subsidise the bus service. We may even have air-conditioned  buses.  So the MRT  is  not  the  only\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we should look at the traffic problem\r\n\r\nas  a  whole,  not only the bus problem.  One  must\r\n\r\ndecide  whether the bus service is going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nservice or a business proposition. It is typical of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, Sir, to try to strike a compromise\r\n\r\nbetween the two - a service, and at the same  time,\r\n\r\na  viable business proposition. It is not difficult\r\n\r\nto  achieve this if all of us co-operate and I urge\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House that in  their  \"Meet-the-People\"  sessions, it is better they sound out  the\r\n\r\npeople,  because  I think that is the  first  salvo\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry for more stringent measures to be\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a discussion with some civil servants who\r\n\r\nare  very  much  concerned about the transportation\r\n\r\nproblem.  My sample of their opinions perhaps  gave\r\n\r\nme  the  courage  to  speak  this  afternoon.  Sir,\r\n\r\nrestriction on private cars travelling in the  city\r\n\r\narea  may  well  be  the  only  solution.  I  would\r\n\r\nimagine, if this scheme is implemented, there would\r\n\r\nbe some degree of hue and cry [Interruption]. Thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  that  -  here  is  a  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ngraduate  who  is  getting on very  well  with  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would imagine that some kind of fee might\r\n\r\nbe imposed on cars travelling into the City centre.\r\n\r\nThis  might create the impression that if  you  can\r\n\r\npay,  you are free to go in; but if I cannot afford\r\n\r\nas  I am a poor man, I am out. I think there is  no\r\n\r\nintention  to  favour the rich, or  make  the  rich\r\n\r\nricher  and the poor poorer. If it has to be  done,\r\n\r\nit  has got to be done. But why do we not, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe  meanwhile,  maybe in the next  month  or  two,\r\n\r\nagree  to  the rule that newly registered  cars  be\r\n\r\nautomatically  restricted from  entering  the  City\r\n\r\narea  during peak hours? This will not involve  any\r\n\r\ncost  to  the Government. Perhaps the new car  will\r\n\r\nhave a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial  alphabet in the number plate, also  at  no\r\n\r\ncost  to the Government at all. So if there is  any\r\n\r\nfavour, we will first favour the old rich, and  the\r\n\r\nnew rich may have to suffer a little inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P.

But just let me elaborate\r\n\r\na little on what I am going to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of car parks at the City fringes, I\r\n\r\nthink, is one of the solutions, but they should not\r\n\r\nbe  unimaginative, simple and plain. A car park  of\r\n\r\nsuch nature should be a complex so that people  can\r\n\r\nmake  use of it. Then we can encourage them to  use\r\n\r\nit.  So  the question of a shuttle service may  not\r\n\r\neven arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  comment  on the reply by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications?   I   think  it   is   particularly\r\n\r\ninteresting  and  important to note  his  statement\r\n\r\nthat  we are stirring up the hornets' nest. Members\r\n\r\nhere will agree with me that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhornets are not always rational. If the Minister is\r\n\r\na hornet, and if we keep on stirring the nest, then\r\n\r\nhis  reaction might well be irrational. Let me give\r\n\r\ntwo  examples  of irrational action  on  his  part.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  by trying to dissuade people from  owning\r\n\r\ncars.  It  has  been well justified recently  in  a\r\n\r\nstatement by the Minister for Finance that the  tax\r\n\r\nimposed  on  petrol  was to  dissuade  people  from\r\n\r\nowning  cars. Secondly, a 30 per cent  increase  in\r\n\r\ntax  on  car  sales.  Now these two  measures  were\r\n\r\nintroduced  with a view to dissuading  people  from\r\n\r\nowning  cars. I am sure the people will use  public\r\n\r\ntransport  if it is a good system. If we  have  not\r\n\r\ncome  to  that  stage, let us  not  at  the  moment\r\n\r\nproceed with irrational action, such as introducing\r\n\r\nthose two measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me comment on a few other\r\n\r\nthings.  I whole-heartedly agree with the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat there should be voluntary restraint in the use\r\n\r\nof   cars  by  cutting  down  unnecessary  driving,\r\n\r\nparticularly during peak hours which  adds  to  the\r\n\r\ncongestion. Secondly, I also agree that car pooling\r\n\r\nis  something  that  is  desirable  and  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged.  Thirdly, is the  Minister  quite  well\r\n\r\naware  that  the third peak according  to  the  car\r\n\r\ncongestion chart is due to school children going to\r\n\r\nand  leaving  school at about noon  time?  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething which, I think, the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\ncan  look  into. Students should as far as possible\r\n\r\nbe  posted to schools within the vicinity of  their\r\n\r\nhomes,  and  not  from east to west,  or  north  to\r\n\r\nsouth. Otherwise, when they criss-cross, they  will\r\n\r\nmeet  somewhere and that happens to be the  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness District. I think this is something  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  fully considered and should be given  good\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe what the Ministry of Communications can\r\n\r\ndo right now is to cut down on kerbside loading and\r\n\r\nunloading. Anyone travelling in the City  today  at\r\n\r\npeak  hours  or during business hours  will  notice\r\n\r\nthat   other  transport  vehicles  parked  at   the\r\n\r\nkerbside  add  to the horrible congestion  that  we\r\n\r\nalready have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staggered hours, I believe the\r\n\r\nMinistry  can  take  a  more  active  interest   in\r\n\r\npersuading  the private sector to get  this  scheme\r\n\r\ngoing.   Unfortunately  only  the  Government   and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards have started this scheme.  Before\r\n\r\nwe  stir the Minister further, may I seek assurance\r\n\r\nfrom  him that he will not proceed to add new taxes\r\n\r\non new cars, and secondly, that he shall not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That comes under the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> The Minister can re-direct\r\n\r\nthat suggestion to him later.

So  if they do not do anything  about  it,\r\n\r\nplease do not complain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang asked when will the\r\n\r\nrestriction on private car travel be introduced.

It  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed,  and  any good recommendations  will  be\r\n\r\nincorporated  before implementation. I  think  that\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer  most of the questions raised by the Members\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein, Kallang and Kim Seng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Telok Blangah asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we are going to do away with the  MRT.

Although credit must be\r\n\r\ngiven for the efficient removal of rubbish for most\r\n\r\nof  the City areas, the same cannot be said of  the\r\n\r\nrural areas and some housing estates. Sometimes the\r\n\r\nrubbish  is collected only on alternate days.  Even\r\n\r\nin  the  City  areas, certain streets are  used  as\r\n\r\nrubbish  collection centres. These streets  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a sufficient number of containers and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  rubbish spill over on to  the  roads,\r\n\r\nthus producing an excellent breeding ground for the\r\n\r\nrats  and other vermin. Many of the people in  some\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  have been complaining  about  the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  You  will remember,  Sir,  the  \"Anti-mosquito  campaign\". We can revive it.  The  Vector\r\n\r\nControl  Unit,  which  was so effective,  has  been\r\n\r\ndefunct  for  some time. Could this  unit  also  be\r\n\r\nrevived?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to bring to the notice of the\r\n\r\nMinister the complaint that the workers who collect\r\n\r\nthe  rubbish from households would just  chuck  the\r\n\r\ndust-bins  after they have thrown the rubbish  into\r\n\r\nthe van. After one or two months the dustbins would\r\n\r\nbreak.  The  Ministry should get the Inspectors  to\r\n\r\ncheck  on all van drivers and workers. It  is  very\r\n\r\nbad  if  the people have to buy dustbins every  now\r\n\r\nand then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nspeaking of refuse disposal, some of our industries\r\n\r\nare  facing  the  difficulty  of  finding  suitable\r\n\r\ndumping  grounds for waste disposal.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   they  are  being  summoned  by  the  Health\r\n\r\nInspectors  for incinerating their  wastes  in  the\r\n\r\nfactory  ground. The reason is that the burning  of\r\n\r\nwastes, including wood and paper, is considered  to\r\n\r\nbe a contribution to air pollution. I wonder if the\r\n\r\nMinister could inform the House whether he has  any\r\n\r\nplans to install public incinerators in appropriate\r\n\r\nlocations  to assist the sawmillers and other  like\r\n\r\nindustries to solve the problem of waste disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  true  that once a public campaign is over,  and\r\n\r\nafter  a lapse of time, there is slackness  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the public with regard to cleanliness  of\r\n\r\nthe  environment  or  to  prevent  mosquitoes  from\r\n\r\nbreeding. But I would refute the suggestion of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampung  Kembangan  that  we  are  not\r\n\r\nconcentrating on keeping the streets clean  because\r\n\r\nwe are spending time on resettling the hawkers. For\r\n\r\nhis information, we try to clean the streets daily.\r\n\r\nI  think we are one of the few authorities that  do\r\n\r\nthis. When a Street is not cleaned or when it is  a\r\n\r\nbit  dirty, we do send down teams of our inspectors\r\n\r\nto  go on a blitzkrieg. Occasionally they may  come\r\n\r\nacross  streets that are dirty and this is probably\r\n\r\nbecause the workers for that day are not available.\r\n\r\nOne  evidence which points to the fact that we  are\r\n\r\nnot  slackening  our efforts to  keep  our  streets\r\n\r\nclean  is  the fact that during the last 12  months\r\n\r\n20,000 persons were brought to court for littering.\r\n\r\nI think we have taken sufficient punitive action by\r\n\r\nbringing 20,000 persons to court during the  course\r\n\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the problem here really lies not\r\n\r\nin  the  sweeping of the streets, but in  educating\r\n\r\nthe   public.  In  my  opinion,  several   of   the\r\n\r\ncampaigns,   for  instance,  the  \"Keep   Singapore\r\n\r\nGreen\",  the \"Keep Singapore Clean\", and the  \"Save\r\n\r\nWater\"  Campaigns,  have been successful.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause in all the statistics that we have gathered\r\n\r\nin  respect of the campaigns to save water  and  to\r\n\r\nkeep  our  streets clean, for instance, indications\r\n\r\nare that there has been a great improvement. But it\r\n\r\ntakes  time. I would say that the solution lies  in\r\n\r\neducating the public, especially the younger  ones,\r\n\r\nto form good habits, and not automatically throw an\r\n\r\nice-cream  wrapper or an ice-cream  cup  once  they\r\n\r\nhave  finished their ice-cream. The solution rather\r\n\r\nis   to   inculcate  in  them  a  sense  of   civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness  .-  make  them  think  twice  before\r\n\r\nthrowing  a  piece of paper. Education  takes  some\r\n\r\ntime to percolate through the whole section of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  At the moment, because of the shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour, we have already bought and are using 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmechanical   sweepers.  Twelve   other   mechanical\r\n\r\nsweepers are under order. They will be here soon. I\r\n\r\ncan  safely say to the Member for Kampung Kembangan\r\n\r\nthat  there  has been no let-up at  all  in  street\r\n\r\ncleansing,   and  the  enforcement   section   will\r\n\r\ncontinue to take action against those littering the\r\n\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to reply to the Member for Anson. He has\r\n\r\nasked  whether efforts are being made by the Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Division to remove rubbish on time. We  are\r\n\r\nmaking  every effort to remove rubbish on  time.  I\r\n\r\nhave here the statistics which I receive regularly.\r\n\r\nThey show the number of complaints with regard  -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is theoretical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is not theoretical. It is\r\n\r\npractical.  If  the Member does not believe  me,  I\r\n\r\ninvite him to spend one day in our Operations room.\r\n\r\nIn  the Operations room we receive complaints  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public, but because of the  rising\r\n\r\nstandard of cleanliness expected by the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  campaigns  that we have launched,  we  receive\r\n\r\nstill  more  complaints. And when  they  find  that\r\n\r\ntheir surroundings are not clean or where there  is\r\n\r\nrubbish, they phone us up and tell us about it. The\r\n\r\ntelephone number of the Operations room is  635111,\r\n\r\nextensions  232  and 233. If the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nthinks that this is fictitious and it exists in  my\r\n\r\nimagination or in the imagination of my officers, I\r\n\r\ndo  invite  him  to spend a day there  to  see  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  complaints. We have compiled statistics\r\n\r\nof these complaints and the action that follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked whether we make\r\n\r\nan  attempt  to  remove the rubbish  on  time.  The\r\n\r\ncomplaints that we receive are divided into several\r\n\r\ncategories.  If  the refuse is not  collected,  and\r\n\r\npeople ring us up and complain, we put it under the\r\n\r\nheading   of   \"Refuse   collection\".   The   other\r\n\r\ncategories are: Mosquitoes, flies, drainage, smell,\r\n\r\nhawkers,  overgrown vegetation, dumping of  refuse,\r\n\r\nsewage,  non-collection  of night-soil,  littering,\r\n\r\ndust,  and so on. On the average, we receive  about\r\n\r\n400\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  500  complaints a month, the least of which  is\r\n\r\nrefuse  collection - six. It may be that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  came across one of those few exceptions\r\n\r\nwhere  refuse was not collected for the day because\r\n\r\nthere  was a shortage of labour for that particular\r\n\r\nday  or  where  the refuse collecting  vehicle  has\r\n\r\nbroken  down. We collect on the average 1,200  tons\r\n\r\ndaily. It is normal for us to collect 1,200 tons of\r\n\r\nrefuse  a  day.  There  are  260  routes  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore where refuse collection is made, and  the\r\n\r\nvehicles  make an average of 400 trips a day.  This\r\n\r\nis  the volume of work on a normal day. On festival\r\n\r\ndays, or particularly during the durian season, the\r\n\r\nvolume of rubbish goes up to nearly 2,000 tons  per\r\n\r\nday.  During  festival days when other citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are enjoying themselves, or  during  the\r\n\r\ndurian  season  when they are eating  and  enjoying\r\n\r\ndurian,  the  officers  in  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment work over-time to clear up the rubbish.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is being made to see that the City  is\r\n\r\nkept  clean.  We are one of the few authorities  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  which  go out daily to collect  refuse.\r\n\r\nThere may come a time when because of traffic  jams\r\n\r\ncaused by commuters, each driving alone in one  car\r\n\r\nand because of a shortage of labour, we may require\r\n\r\nthe  householder, as is being done  in  some  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  to packet his rubbish and wait  outside\r\n\r\nthe house at a certain time of the day to catch the\r\n\r\nvan when it passes by to put the rubbish in. If the\r\n\r\nhouseholder is not there at that time, it  is  just\r\n\r\ntoo  bad.  He will have to bring the garbage  back,\r\n\r\nkeep  it in the house, and live with the smell.  We\r\n\r\nhave  not reached that stage yet, but we are  doing\r\n\r\neverything we can to prevent this inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nhouseholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about over-spilling of\r\n\r\nbins.  Bins  are provided in markets at  a  central\r\n\r\nspot  where  the surrounding areas are inaccessible\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the narrow streets or because  of  bad\r\n\r\nroads.  The  bins  provided  at  such  places   are\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  the normal volume of  refuse.  But\r\n\r\nsome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntradesmen  Sir, tradesmen now have to pay  more  to\r\n\r\nhave  their refuse removed if it exceeds a  certain\r\n\r\nvolume  - have surreptitiously dumped their rubbish\r\n\r\nthere, and as a result these bins overspill.  There\r\n\r\nwere  instances  where we had to collect  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  times  a  day  from one place.  I  would  ask\r\n\r\nMembers  to have a look at Queen Street. Two  hours\r\n\r\nafter  removal, all the bins are filled  again.  So\r\n\r\nthis is not an easy job, but we are doing our best.\r\n\r\nOnce we find that we have access to the roads,  the\r\n\r\nbins  would  be  removed and the normal  method  of\r\n\r\ncollection would take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint of mosquitoes, I must say that\r\n\r\neverybody is complaining about mosquitoes. We  must\r\n\r\nhave  mosquitoes in our tropical climate. We cannot\r\n\r\neliminate  them.  We  have anti-mosquito  campaigns\r\n\r\nand,  as  usual, after the campaign people  forget.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  I  am glad to inform the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nthat  at  present the mosquito situation  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  We  make random visits to houses  and  to\r\n\r\nsites  every month and during the last two  months,\r\n\r\nthe  incidence of mosquito breeding has gone  down.\r\n\r\nIt  is  round  about  two per  cent  and  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Of  course,  we can have  campaign  after\r\n\r\ncampaign. But if we have it too often and too  long\r\n\r\na   period  for  each  campaign,  it  becomes  non-productive.  And there are other departments  which\r\n\r\nmay also want to carry out their own campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Kim Keat as to whether\r\n\r\nwe  will  build incinerators or provide places  for\r\n\r\npeople  to dispose of their rubbish by burning,  if\r\n\r\nhe has been following the news lately he would have\r\n\r\ncome across an item in the papers which states that\r\n\r\nwe  are  building an incinerator costing about  $50\r\n\r\nmillion.  But  that  apart, the question  of  waste\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  sawdust  from  sawmills  is  quite  a\r\n\r\nproblem.  Wherever  possible,  we  suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nsawmillers   to  get  together  and  construct   an\r\n\r\nincinerator to burn their refuse without  polluting\r\n\r\nthe  air.  Actually we encourage that. In the  past\r\n\r\nthey had been able to get away by just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrowing the sawdust anywhere. But with the setting\r\n\r\nup of the Ministry of the Environment, such liberty\r\n\r\nand freedom to pollute our environment must not  be\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered all the questions\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd.

But why is  it  that\r\n\r\nold   and  damaged  refuse  bins  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have not been replaced?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I think it is up to the\r\n\r\nhouseholder  to make good the bins that  have  been\r\n\r\nspoilt  or  destroyed.

Probably  in  their\r\n\r\nhaste to rid themselves of the dirt on the dustbin,\r\n\r\nthey  put it down quickly.

Knowledge  of  these\r\n\r\nfigures   would  enable  Government,  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and other organisations  to  be  more\r\n\r\nvigilant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, much as I would like to give\r\n\r\nthe  figures  requested for, I am afraid  I  cannot\r\n\r\nbecause,  firstly,  the figures are  not  available\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, even if they are available I  would\r\n\r\nrequest  that a Question be put up for oral  answer\r\n\r\nbecause these are too detailed. For the information\r\n\r\nof  the Member, there are no figures available  for\r\n\r\nthe  years  1969  to  1972 largely  because  dengue\r\n\r\nhaemorrhagic  fever  was  a non-notifiable  disease\r\n\r\nthen. It is very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult to diagnose dengue haemorrhagic fever and\r\n\r\nthere  is no way of telling quickly whether  it  is\r\n\r\nreally DHF or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to allay the Member's fears, the situation is\r\n\r\nunder  control. The number of incidence in  January\r\n\r\nand  February has gone down greatly.  In  fact,  in\r\n\r\nFebruary there were only eight known cases. We have\r\n\r\ncome  to  an understanding with the authorities  at\r\n\r\nthe  General  Hospital  for  a  standard  form   of\r\n\r\ndiagnosing dengue haemorrhagic fever. The incidence\r\n\r\nhas  been  brought down largely because  of  swing-fogging in affected areas. That is all I can say at\r\n\r\nthe moment. But as far as figures are concerned,  I\r\n\r\nam afraid I am unable to give the Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that DHF\r\n\r\ncan  be  suppressed if the mosquito  population  is\r\n\r\nlowered  appreciably. There  are  various  ways  of\r\n\r\ndiminishing the mosquito population. One  of  these\r\n\r\nis the oiling method. It appears, and if I am wrong\r\n\r\nI  stand corrected and hope for clarification, that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  some  slackening  of  suppressive\r\n\r\nmethods  of diminishing the mosquito population  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment when  they  ceased\r\n\r\noiling  the  construction sites.  The  construction\r\n\r\nsites,  at the present moment, are being  oiled  by\r\n\r\nthe   contractors  themselves.  This  is  far  from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  because  the contractors,  not  being\r\n\r\ndirectly involved in public health, do not have the\r\n\r\nknow-how  and have little to gain but something  to\r\n\r\nlose in financial expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health hazards of such a potent nature in such\r\n\r\nlarge  areas,  like construction sites,  should  be\r\n\r\nobliterated  by  the Government. It  is  imperative\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry again implements, as a matter  of\r\n\r\nurgency, this oiling process in construction  sites\r\n\r\nand charge the contractors for this service, and be\r\n\r\never  vigilant  in  other areas of  known  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding,  utilising whatever methods available  to\r\n\r\ncurb the breeding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these  pests.  Would the Minister,  considering\r\n\r\nthat  the lives of the people are precious,  accede\r\n\r\nto my humble plea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the most effective way of\r\n\r\nkeeping   down   mosquitoes   is   to   have   good\r\n\r\nhousekeeping. There are 500,000 homes in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  if  every  one does his share of housekeeping,\r\n\r\nthere would be no mosquitoes and there would be  no\r\n\r\ncomplaints about mosquito nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the oiling of construction sites,\r\n\r\nunder  the  law  now every one is  responsible  for\r\n\r\nmosquito breeding in his home and the contractor is\r\n\r\nresponsible for mosquito breeding at his work site.\r\n\r\nWe  tried  to help before by oiling the work  sites\r\n\r\nfor  them. But we found that as a result there  was\r\n\r\nno  feeling  of  responsibility. They  became  more\r\n\r\ncareless, and we found that it was not possible for\r\n\r\nus  to keep track and do the work for them. Arising\r\n\r\nout of this, they found that it is cheaper for them\r\n\r\nto do the oiling themselves or to get professionals\r\n\r\nto  do  it,  than to pay fines imposed on  them.  I\r\n\r\nthink  every one of us has a responsibility to  see\r\n\r\nthat  we do not provide the facility for mosquitoes\r\n\r\nto  breed  in  our own home. In the same  way,  the\r\n\r\ncontractor  is responsible for the cleanliness  and\r\n\r\nsafety  of his construction site and to see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  no facilities for  mosquitoes  to\r\n\r\nbreed.  Incidentally, by the way, for the  Member's\r\n\r\npeace  of  mind,  the mosquitoes usually  found  in\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites are not the  type  that  caused\r\n\r\ndengue haemorrhagic fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, my fears have been allayed by\r\n\r\nthe Minister, and I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head IA be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead BM 1111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new regulations regarding handling of\r\n\r\nfood is no doubt good for the health of the public,\r\n\r\nbut  I am afraid to say that some of the conditions\r\n\r\nare stiff and may drive many hawkers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  of business. Take, for instance, poh piah  and\r\n\r\nroti prata hawkers. How can a hawker preparing roti\r\n\r\nprata  make this bread with knives and spoons,  let\r\n\r\nalone  chopsticks? Are the hawker inspectors  given\r\n\r\ninstructions  to be lenient with such  hawkers  who\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice  but to use their fingers  in  the\r\n\r\npreparation of such types of food?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker inspectors should be given a course on\r\n\r\nhuman  relations. I have received  complaints  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  the inspectors are arrogant and  rude  to\r\n\r\nhawkers.  Some are so inconsiderate that they  pick\r\n\r\non particular hawkers and victimise them. I quote a\r\n\r\ncase of a female hawker in my constituency who  had\r\n\r\nbeen harassed and issued with many summonses by the\r\n\r\nhawker   inspector,  who  seemed  to   relish   his\r\n\r\nauthority   and  uniform.  The  woman   became   so\r\n\r\ndesperate  that  she committed suicide  by  jumping\r\n\r\ndown from a nearby block of flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what steps are taken by the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment to resite all stalls that are  operating\r\n\r\nin back lanes? Nowadays we can find many of them in\r\n\r\nthe  lanes which are very unhygienic, with  toilets\r\n\r\nsited  close to the stalls and with stagnant  water\r\n\r\nin   the   drain.  Would  the  Department  consider\r\n\r\nresiting  all  those hawkers in this  situation  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, there has been a move to computerise\r\n\r\nhawker licences, and the hawkers are expected to co-operate   by  giving  their  particulars   to   the\r\n\r\nofficials concerned, or else they may lose  certain\r\n\r\nbenefits later on. It may end up similarly like the\r\n\r\ntenants  in pre-war houses whose names were omitted\r\n\r\nfor  some obvious reasons during census-taking  and\r\n\r\nthat   resulted  in  no  priority  for  alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation during clearance time.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nrequest  that ample notice and plenty  of  time  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  hawkers in going  about  with  this\r\n\r\ncomputerisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\namendment moved by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson. I think there is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmerit in what he said. While it is right and proper\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of the Environment to emphasise on\r\n\r\nclean  and hygienic measures in the preparation  of\r\n\r\nfood and the method it should be served, I think  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  consideration  must  be  given  by  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors  in  their  inspection  of  hawkers  for\r\n\r\ncleanliness  and proper hygienic methods  used  for\r\n\r\ngiving out food to the particular type of food that\r\n\r\nis prepared. The Member has mentioned quite rightly\r\n\r\ntwo items, for example, poh piah and roti prata. To\r\n\r\ninsist  that this poh piah seller wears  gloves  is\r\n\r\nutter  nonsense to me. Poh piah cannot be  prepared\r\n\r\nwith  gloved hands. On the other hand, emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthe  use of gloves is not in itself a guarantee  of\r\n\r\nhygienic  preparation.  A  person  can  wear  dirty\r\n\r\ngloves  for the whole day, dig his nose  and  ears,\r\n\r\nand  the  pair  of  gloves will  certainly  not  be\r\n\r\nhygienic.  The  emphasis  is  that  the  method  of\r\n\r\npreparation  must be hygienic. In any execution  to\r\n\r\nensure  hygienic  measures, the  hawker  inspectors\r\n\r\nshould use their discretion and intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I am aware that certain\r\n\r\nsections  in  the  Food  Ordinance  do  not   allow\r\n\r\nhandling of food with bare hands, but I have enough\r\n\r\nconfidence in members of my staff to see that  they\r\n\r\nenforce the law with intelligence and humanity.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are exceptions. I quite  agree  that\r\n\r\npoh  piah  and roti prata cannot be prepared  other\r\n\r\nthan  by the use of the hands. I think we have been\r\n\r\nallowing such methods of preparation, and I am  not\r\n\r\naware that the officials of the Ministry insist  on\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers  wearing gloves. But I  am  sure  that\r\n\r\nMembers  would like to see that the  poh  piah  and\r\n\r\nroti prata that they eat are prepared by very clean\r\n\r\nhands.  In  fact, only last week I had occasion  to\r\n\r\ncome  across  some  hawkers  who,  while  preparing\r\n\r\ncertain  food with their hands, were  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  handling dirty shillings. This is an instance\r\n\r\nof unhygienic handling of food that we want to stop\r\n\r\nor  at  least to teach the hawkers the correct  and\r\n\r\nhygienic way of handling food. As the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kim  Seng  has properly  put  it,  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  should be on cleanliness and not  on  the\r\n\r\nmethod of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the sad story by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nabout harassment by inspectors which caused a woman\r\n\r\nhawker  to  commit suicide. I doubt his story  very\r\n\r\nmuch.  If  it  were true, and if  he  can  give  me\r\n\r\ndetails  of the case, we will see that the  culprit\r\n\r\nis  brought to book. To blame the hawker  inspector\r\n\r\nfor  the suicide of that woman hawker is just  like\r\n\r\nblaming  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  for\r\n\r\nbuilding high-rise flats which have led to so  many\r\n\r\nsuicide cases. So I think it is a bit unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Anson and hon. Members\r\n\r\nmust have known that during the last few months  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  spending a lot of time  and  effort  in\r\n\r\nresiting   hawkers  from  the  streets.  Our   main\r\n\r\nobjective  is, of course, to move all hawkers  from\r\n\r\nthe  streets  into  hawker centres  or  appropriate\r\n\r\nbuildings  where they can exercise cleanliness  and\r\n\r\nwhere  they can be better supervised so  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not dirty or clog up the streets. This  will\r\n\r\ngo on until all of them are resettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson need not have any fears that\r\n\r\ncomputerisation   of  hawkers'  particulars   would\r\n\r\nresult   in  some  of  the  hawkers  losing   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood. This is just an administrative  measure\r\n\r\nto  use modern methods of administration and  modem\r\n\r\nmachines  so  that  when  the  hawkers  go  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry for renewal of licences, it could be  done\r\n\r\nquickly.  This  is just to speed up  administrative\r\n\r\nprocedure. There is nothing sinister in that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Hawkers' Department  for  having\r\n\r\nfinally  implemented the Sale of Food  Act  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the consumers.

For example, Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah around Newton and in Thomson Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in some of the drains, especially\r\n\r\nthose  covered  with metal grids,  is  not  flowing\r\n\r\nproperly and therefore stagnates. This results in a\r\n\r\nstinking  smell,  and the drains  become  excellent\r\n\r\ngrounds for breeding mosquitoes. Furthermore,  some\r\n\r\nof the canals and monsoon drains, like the one near\r\n\r\nthe  People's Park, are constantly giving out  foul\r\n\r\nsmell.  This  is also due to the poor flow  of  the\r\n\r\nwater.  Can  something be done to ensure  a  proper\r\n\r\nflow of the water?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Rochore Canal has the reputation of\r\n\r\nproducing  the  \"best aroma\" for residents  in  the\r\n\r\narea.  Of  late, it has acquired the ill-repute  of\r\n\r\nbeing  the cause of floods. This is because of  the\r\n\r\ncanal work which has been going on for the last two\r\n\r\nyears.  In fact, work on that canal has stopped  of\r\n\r\nlate.  Has the contractor disappeared again? It  is\r\n\r\ntime something was done about this canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, the City area has experienced freak\r\n\r\nfloods  - something that has never occurred before.\r\n\r\nIs  this due to poor drainage in the City area,  or\r\n\r\nis  it  caused by the filling of the sea to reclaim\r\n\r\nmore land? Such heavy floods have not occurred  for\r\n\r\nmany   years.  Could  it  be  that  since  we   are\r\n\r\nreclaiming  land  from the sea, the  water  has  no\r\n\r\nchance  of flowing outward but to flow back to  the\r\n\r\nland?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the department done to stop a recurrence\r\n\r\nof  these floods? During one of these freak floods,\r\n\r\nmany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshopkeepers had their goods soaked with sea  water,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  a  heavy financial loss.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nreclaiming  land from the sea is very bad.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe Government wants to do that, we do not want  to\r\n\r\nobject. It is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stand at the Kallang Basin for one hour,\r\n\r\nyou  can  get a terrible smell.

The Minister  must  do\r\n\r\nsomething about the drains and canals. Otherwise it\r\n\r\nwill  be  very difficult for us to be here debating\r\n\r\nabout  anti-pollution and anti-mosquito  campaigns.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of all these campaigns if we do not\r\n\r\ndo anything about drains and canals? We must do our\r\n\r\nduty. Then we can ask the people to do their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, for the information of the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  I  would  like  to  say   that\r\n\r\nregulations  are not made to cause epidemics.  They\r\n\r\nare made to prevent epidemics. So the occurrence of\r\n\r\ntyphoid  fever  has  got nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nregulations. In fact, if we had not been alert, the\r\n\r\nepidemic   would   have  spread  to   far   greater\r\n\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked what remedial action has been taken\r\n\r\nto  alleviate  the  constant  floods  in  low-lying\r\n\r\nlocalities, like Bukit Timah and Thomson Road after\r\n\r\na short shower. I live around that area. In fact, I\r\n\r\npass  that area every day in the morning,  evening,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes at night. But I am not aware of  any\r\n\r\nincrease  in occurrences of floods. There  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen any increase and it is largely because we have\r\n\r\ncompleted  the first part of the Bukit Timah  Flood\r\n\r\nAlleviation Scheme. So what he has come  across  is\r\n\r\nprobably what we call a \"flash flood\" which  occurs\r\n\r\nwhen  there is a sudden heavy downpour. Large areas\r\n\r\nof our country have been developed. Where there was\r\n\r\nland before, there is concrete now; it is built up,\r\n\r\nand  the capacity to absorb water is not there. The\r\n\r\ndrains  are built for normal showers just like  our\r\n\r\nroads are built\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  accommodate normal traffic. And  as  peak  hour\r\n\r\ntraffic  jams  up  our roads, so a  heavy  downpour\r\n\r\ncauses  \"flash floods\" which will subside  after  a\r\n\r\nshort period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the smell at Rochore Canal, I agree\r\n\r\nthat  this  place has been famous for it  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.  Government after government had been making\r\n\r\nefforts   to  get  rid  of  the  smell.   For   his\r\n\r\ninformation, I would like to say that the smell  is\r\n\r\nnot  due to poor flow of water, but rubbish  thrown\r\n\r\ninto   the  canal  by  careless  and  irresponsible\r\n\r\nmembers of the public, and the rubbish prevents the\r\n\r\nwater  from  flowing. It decomposes, putrefies  and\r\n\r\nthe  result  is the smell. The Rochore Canal  is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult canal to work on too. That is one of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why many contractors have gone bankrupt  or\r\n\r\nhave  given  up  their contracts  half-way  through\r\n\r\nbecause  they had to work in between rising  tides,\r\n\r\nand the canal being messy and dirty, they could not\r\n\r\nget  enough people to work there. There was also  a\r\n\r\nshortage of materials. But we have a new contractor\r\n\r\nnow,  and he has completed 70 per cent of the work.\r\n\r\nThere is a balance of 30 per cent of the work to be\r\n\r\ndone,  and we hope that he will find enough workers\r\n\r\nto  work in these very unpleasant surroundings  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  the contract by the end of the year.  The\r\n\r\nsky may be bright, the moon may be high, but it  is\r\n\r\nexactly when the sky is bright and the moon is high\r\n\r\nthat we get high tides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But on the occasion that I mentioned there\r\n\r\nwas  no  full  moon, but still the  tide  came  and\r\n\r\nflooded the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The tide that he mentioned was a\r\n\r\nfreak tide, which is not normal. The freak tide was\r\n\r\nthe  highest recorded in 20 years. It was two  feet\r\n\r\nhigher  than  normal, and high tides usually  occur\r\n\r\naround  that time of the year. We have  the  spring\r\n\r\ntide  around the Chinese New Year and, as far as  I\r\n\r\ncan  remember, very high tides usually occur on the\r\n\r\n3rd day and on the 18th day of the Chinese Moon.

But the freak tide that the Member referred\r\n\r\nto was so high that it even covered the breakwater.\r\n\r\nThose Members who were observant enough on that day\r\n\r\nwould  have  noticed  that  it  even  covered   the\r\n\r\nbreakwater.  So the freak flood that  had  occurred\r\n\r\nwas  not the result of land reclamation. It has got\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with it.

He must go to Balmoral\r\n\r\nRoad  at  the junction of Stevens Road/Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nRoad.  When there is rain, the flood occurs  there.\r\n\r\nHe  has  never seen that. Probably he never crosses\r\n\r\nthat part of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the flood which occurred last month, it\r\n\r\nhas  never happened before. I know because  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen   in  Singapore  for  45  years.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nsurprising that the tide was so high. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  that  it was not due to  reclamation  of\r\n\r\nland.  But I think that most probably it is because\r\n\r\nof  the  reclamation of land from the sea.  If  you\r\n\r\nclaim a part of the sea, the water cannot flow over\r\n\r\nthere,  scientifically speaking. There is something\r\n\r\nwrong there. I would like the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthe  matter. He can get experts to see why the tide\r\n\r\ncame into the land; came inside, and not that side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  his explanation of the water  coming\r\n\r\nthis  side or that side is the right one.

I  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered,  Sir, that planning-wise there  was  no\r\n\r\nprovision  made for an additional market  in  these\r\n\r\nhousing    estates.   Therefore,   pressure    will\r\n\r\ninevitably  be  brought  to  bear  on  the  present\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens  market. I  do  understand  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  vacancies in the  market,  but  I\r\n\r\nanticipate,  with  the large  number  of  residents\r\n\r\ncoming  into the constituency, there can  be  scope\r\n\r\nfor expanding the present market. In fact, a septic\r\n\r\ntank occupying a fairly large area of land has been\r\n\r\ndemolished  and  there is vacancy adjacent  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  Serangoon Gardens market. I have taken  up\r\n\r\nthe  matter  some  months  ago  with  the  relevant\r\n\r\ndepartment as to the feasibility of expanding  this\r\n\r\nmarket,  but  to-date,  I have  not  heard  of  any\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and I will appreciate enlightenment on\r\n\r\nthe part of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here.

In  every\r\n\r\nannual Budget, Members hope that something more can\r\n\r\nbe  provided  for  their  constituencies,  but  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned  must  go  about  it   in   a\r\n\r\nrealistic way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion of the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens just now, I would say  that  the\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   the  Serangoon   Gardens   market,\r\n\r\naccording  to our survey, is not an urgent  problem\r\n\r\nat  this juncture. At present, there are 148 stalls\r\n\r\nin  this  market, out of which 30 are still vacant.\r\n\r\nThis goes to show that the demand for market stalls\r\n\r\nis  not  high.  Unless all these stalls  are  fully\r\n\r\ntaken  up,  we will not expand this market  because\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  realistic. As to the improvement  of\r\n\r\nfacilities,  the  department concerned  has  always\r\n\r\npaid   attention   to  this  and,   if   necessary,\r\n\r\nimprovements will generally be made to the existing\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in 1972 the Government has set\r\n\r\nup  a  food  hawker  centre in  that  constituency.\r\n\r\nAccording  to our understanding, many residents  in\r\n\r\nthe  locality often go to Lim Tua Tow market to buy\r\n\r\ntheir  daily  necessities. Therefore,  we  are  now\r\n\r\nplanning to expand the market at Lim Tua Tow  Road.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the expansion, it will also\r\n\r\nprovide  more  facilities  for  the  residents   in\r\n\r\nSerangoon Garden Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general information of the Members, with\r\n\r\nregard  to the policy on the licensing of  hawkers,\r\n\r\napart  from  the Member concerned,  I  think  other\r\n\r\nMembers may also wish to know the licensing  policy\r\n\r\nof  the Hawkers Department. I would like to clarify\r\n\r\nthat after the 1968-69 nation-wide registration  of\r\n\r\nhawkers,  bona  fide hawkers based on  the  1968-69\r\n\r\ncensus of hawkers were issued with licences.  Since\r\n\r\nJune  1973,  the  department  has  not  issued  any\r\n\r\nlicence  to  any  out-door  hawkers  or  to  street\r\n\r\nhawkers.  At  the  present moment,  we  only  issue\r\n\r\nlicences  to  hawkers  in  markets  or  in   hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.  At  the  present  stage,  we  will   only\r\n\r\nconsider issuing market or hawker centre licences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the following categories of people. First, those\r\n\r\nlicensed   hawkers  affected  by   any   government\r\n\r\nredevelopment  scheme.  Secondly,  those  who   are\r\n\r\ndisabled  due  to  industrial or  other  accidents,\r\n\r\nbecause  by  being disabled they  have  lost  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  for hard manual or complicated work  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we decide to help them by issuing  them\r\n\r\nwith licence for hawking. Thirdly, those who are in\r\n\r\nreceipt  of social welfare assistance. We  hope  to\r\n\r\nmake  them  self-supporting by  issuing  them  with\r\n\r\nhawker  licences to make a living. Fourthly,  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  above 40 years old. We believe  that  the\r\n\r\nyounger   generation   have  undergone   industrial\r\n\r\ntraining  or other basic education and they  should\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  their  talent  and  capabilities  to\r\n\r\ncompete  in  the field of international  industrial\r\n\r\ntechnology.  They should not commit  themselves  to\r\n\r\nthe  world of petty hawking to make a small  profit\r\n\r\nas   their   time  and  talent  would  be   wasted.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  by competing in the technical  field,\r\n\r\nthey  will  contribute not only  towards  bettering\r\n\r\nthemselves  but also to the national economy  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  Therefore,  we should encourage  our  young\r\n\r\npeople to embark on the right path. They should not\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to take up hawking as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood just for the sake of a small profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary for the first half  of  his\r\n\r\nlong  and  lengthy answer.

How else can I come  up  with\r\n\r\nthis  statement during Budget time? I have said  it\r\n\r\nwith the most honest intention, and I think we  are\r\n\r\nimmensely proud of the fact that Singapore is,  and\r\n\r\nit  is again and again being repeated, the cleanest\r\n\r\ncity in Asia, and rightly so. Much credit should be\r\n\r\ngiven to the Ministry of the Environment. I do  not\r\n\r\nwish to dwell for long on praising the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally intended to raise certain topics but\r\n\r\nthey  have already been covered. I therefore intend\r\n\r\nto  point  out just two matters which the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  the Environment might like to comment. One  is\r\n\r\nthe hawker problem. The Minister must be well aware\r\n\r\nthat  at  various  hawker centres, particularly  at\r\n\r\nnight  and  I  am  sure  also  by  day,  there  are\r\n\r\ninadequate provisions for ash trays, litter bins or\r\n\r\ndustbins for the disposal of all forms of waste. It\r\n\r\nis no consolation to the consumers, in going either\r\n\r\nto  Hokien Street, Beach Road, or the Orchard  Road\r\n\r\ncar  park  for a meal or a bowl of mutton soup,  to\r\n\r\nhave  at frequent times to wallow through a  rather\r\n\r\nunclean  path  littered  with  food  wastes,  paper\r\n\r\nlitter  and cigarette butts. I believe the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment has powers to impose upon  the\r\n\r\nhawkers   the   obligation  to   provide   adequate\r\n\r\nfacilities for containing these wastes. I think the\r\n\r\nprovision of ash trays on all the tables should  be\r\n\r\nmade  compulsory,  and  certainly  litter  bins  or\r\n\r\ndustbins should be provided. Sometimes at  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  places you can even see rats joining in  the\r\n\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> It is a rat race!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> The second matter which the\r\n\r\nMinister might like to comment on is with regard to\r\n\r\nthe division of control on the hawker population in\r\n\r\nSingapore. We all know that the hawkers are divided\r\n\r\ninto  two divisions, one under the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  and  the other under the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational   Development.  This  division  into   two\r\n\r\ncategories has caused a fair amount of confusion in\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of the public, and certainly among  some\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament. Occasionally it has  led  to\r\n\r\npassing the buck from one to the other, so  that  a\r\n\r\nhawker applicant is shuttled from one to the  other\r\n\r\nand back to the first. To me this is an unnecessary\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I think the division into two categories\r\n\r\nmay give rise to a lack of control over a situation\r\n\r\nwhich I can well imagine. It is Government's policy\r\n\r\nto allow one household to own no more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  one hawker stall, but it is well within their\r\n\r\nimagination and certainly very possible - in actual\r\n\r\nfact  true  -that some families own more  than  one\r\n\r\nhawker  stall, one obtained from the Hawkers Branch\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of the Environment and another from\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments I would like to thank you for\r\n\r\nthe opportunity, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  the Member for Kim  Seng  for  his\r\n\r\nopening statement. I think my staff will be  really\r\n\r\nencouraged  by  his expression of appreciation  for\r\n\r\nthe  work  they  have  done  under  very  difficult\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  Members  may  not  know  that   the\r\n\r\nenforcement of rules and regulations regarding  the\r\n\r\ncleanliness of a place and the control  of  hawkers\r\n\r\nis quite a difficult and dangerous job. Members may\r\n\r\nhave often heard of officers of the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment being assaulted. Yesterday  two  of  my\r\n\r\ninspectors were badly assaulted. One of them is now\r\n\r\nwarded in the hospital with a broken head. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  other side of the picture which the Member for\r\n\r\nKim  Seng should know. As far as possible, they  do\r\n\r\ntheir  work with firmness and fairness, but  we  do\r\n\r\ncome across members of the public who take the  law\r\n\r\ninto  their  own  hands. And in instances  of  this\r\n\r\nnature  we will definitely take a serious view  and\r\n\r\nthose responsible will be severely dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the suggestion in regard to the\r\n\r\nprovision  of litter bins and ash trays  at  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres,  there  are litter bins in these  centres.\r\n\r\nProbably  there may not be enough. But  the  places\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member mentioned, especially the Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad  car  park, are so crowded that the  customers\r\n\r\neven  find  it  difficult to pass each  other,  and\r\n\r\ninvariably  litter bins are kicked  aside.  On  the\r\n\r\nquestion of ash trays, we have tried it out in  the\r\n\r\nold  market  at Beach Road. The hawkers there  were\r\n\r\nasked  to  provide  ash trays.  Members  know  that\r\n\r\ncommercial houses have been giving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naway free ash trays as a form of advertisement, and\r\n\r\nthey come in various sizes and various shapes. They\r\n\r\nwere put there. Some ash trays were shallow and, as\r\n\r\na  result, cigarette ash was blown on to the  food.\r\n\r\nAnd  if the ash trays were deep enough, they became\r\n\r\nmini-litter  bins. So it does not work.  Anyway  we\r\n\r\nare  looking into the problem and we will be trying\r\n\r\nout  a new type of litter bin where the top section\r\n\r\nis  filled with sand for cigarettes. This matter is\r\n\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised a question on the division\r\n\r\nof  authority over hawkers between the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development  and  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment. It is very clear cut. Hawkers who  ply\r\n\r\ntheir trade in Housing Board estates come under the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  National  Development  because   the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates are built and maintained by  them.\r\n\r\nIt  would be difficult for another authority to  go\r\n\r\nin  and maintain part of the estate. Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nrents  collected from these estates are due to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board. Anyway, there is very close liaison\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Ministry of National Development  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment with regard to the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of hawkers. I would not say that the  case\r\n\r\nwhich the Member mentioned where a family gets more\r\n\r\nthan  one  hawker stall would not  occur.  It  does\r\n\r\noccur  even if control were to come under a  single\r\n\r\nMinistry. Such cases do occur. But whatever it  is,\r\n\r\nthere  is  very  close  liaison  between  the   two\r\n\r\nMinistries,   and  we  have  been  operating   this\r\n\r\ndivision of authority for quite some time.  As  far\r\n\r\nas  we  can  see,  it  is working  quite  smoothly.\r\n\r\nWhenever they have problems in controlling  hawkers\r\n\r\nand in maintaining cleanliness, they come to us and\r\n\r\nwe do send reinforcements. On the question of rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations governing hawkers, we try to  make\r\n\r\nthe same rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance\r\n\r\nand  comments made by the Minister, I beg leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $60,949,880 for Head IA ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $49,094,800 for Head IA ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head JA --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head JA be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004*.\r\n\r\n(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Lai Tha Chai.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that culture and art are very\r\n\r\nimportant  in the life of the people. Besides  such\r\n\r\nnecessities   as   food,  shelter,   clothing   and\r\n\r\ntransport,  the cultural life of the people  is  an\r\n\r\nindispensable  aspect of their lives.  Culture  and\r\n\r\nart  are not only the spiritual food of the  people\r\n\r\nbut  also  symbols  of their spiritual  outlook.  A\r\n\r\ncountry  without culture and art  is  like  a  body\r\n\r\nwithout life. It is like living in a desert. How do\r\n\r\nwe expect one to survive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a newly independent country. We have\r\n\r\nmany  cultural traditions. Basically,  if  we  work\r\n\r\nhard to sustain and promote the rich traditions  of\r\n\r\nour  various cultures, we can develop them  further\r\n\r\nand  so  ensure that our people will be a  cultured\r\n\r\nrace.  Just  as  the Minister said last  week,  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries have a rich heritage of  cultures.\r\n\r\nBut  what  have  we  done in the promotion  of  our\r\n\r\ncultures? I believe the Minister will agree with me\r\n\r\nwhen I say that, in the development of our cultural\r\n\r\nwork, we are going about it very slowly. We are not\r\n\r\nmaking much headway,.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the Ministry of Culture has done\r\n\r\nsomething in the promotion of our cultures and art.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last few years, for example, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  organised  public art shows, public  concerts,\r\n\r\nappreciation of drama, and so on. But this  is  not\r\n\r\nenough.  There is not enough effect. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  Radio and Television Singapore has not taken\r\n\r\na  leading role in the promotion of our traditional\r\n\r\ncultures.  In their broadcast programmes only  some\r\n\r\nhave any educational value. They are the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforums   and  seminars  on  the  fuel  crisis,   on\r\n\r\ninflation, the presentation of the debates  between\r\n\r\nthe  Universities in Singapore, Malaysia  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  programmes \"For the Family\"  and  children's\r\n\r\ncorner,  and so on. These programmes are  good  and\r\n\r\neducational.  However,  a  great  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes are meaningless slap-sticks, meaningless\r\n\r\nstories  without any educational significance.  Let\r\n\r\nme  quote  some examples. There are some programmes\r\n\r\nfull of mystery and professional gamblers who teach\r\n\r\nus   how   to  swindle  our  way  through   various\r\n\r\nsituations.   And  there  are  also   some   stupid\r\n\r\ncomedies.  The content of these programmes  is  not\r\n\r\nright. There are supposed comedies all of which are\r\n\r\nnonsensical    and    without    any    educational\r\n\r\nsignificance. This will be a stumbling block in our\r\n\r\neffort  to build a healthy culture and will  be  an\r\n\r\nunhealthy influence on our young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Minister has often\r\n\r\nemphasised the need to build a healthy and cultural\r\n\r\nlife  so  that our people will be good and  have  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  outlook.  But I am afraid  the  people  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  these  television programmes  have  not\r\n\r\nimplemented  these policies properly. In  order  to\r\n\r\nfurther promote the cultural arts, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest the following measures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We should promote healthy cultural activities\r\n\r\non   a   large  scale.  For  example,   we   should\r\n\r\nperiodically  hold  cultural  festivals.  In  these\r\n\r\nfestivals we can allow a rich intermingling of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  songs,  dances and dramas of  the  various\r\n\r\ncultures.  If  we  do  this,  we  will  provide  an\r\n\r\nopportunity for the various cultural workers in the\r\n\r\nvarious  language  streams  to  come  together  and\r\n\r\ndevelop the cultural activities more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should set up a cultural committee to\r\n\r\nsupervise   the   content  of  the  programmes   on\r\n\r\ntelevision  and radio to ensure that the programmes\r\n\r\nwill play a greater role in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We should promote and finance activities in\r\n\r\nthe  schools  and  in the various organisations  so\r\n\r\nthat they can organise more cultural programmes. In\r\n\r\nthe hiring of the National Theatre, they should  be\r\n\r\ngiven cheaper rates as an incentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We should adopt more stringent measures on\r\n\r\nsuppressing yellow culture. We have to ensure  that\r\n\r\nour young people grow up in a healthy environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to raise a second point.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in  regard  to  the  question  of  colour\r\n\r\ntelevision. Last year when Parliament was  debating\r\n\r\nthe policy of Government, the Minister informed the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  colour television would be  introduced\r\n\r\nthis  year.  This year will herald in  the  era  of\r\n\r\ncolour television. I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nas  to  what  progress has been made. How  far  has\r\n\r\npreparatory work been done for the introduction  of\r\n\r\ncolour   television?   When   will   the   official\r\n\r\ncommencement date be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is in regard to cultural\r\n\r\ndelegations which are sent abroad. In the last  two\r\n\r\nyears,   we  have  sent  cultural  delegations   to\r\n\r\nfriendly  countries  for visits.  The  aim  was  to\r\n\r\nintroduce our cultures to other countries  so  that\r\n\r\nthose   countries  could  better   understand   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our country. Sending such  cultural\r\n\r\ndelegations  and missions have advantages  in  many\r\n\r\nrespects.   We   can  only  improve  the   cultural\r\n\r\nintercourse between countries. We can also  improve\r\n\r\nthe  friendly  relationships between countries.  In\r\n\r\naddition, it will provide our cultural workers with\r\n\r\na  great  incentive and encouragement  to  continue\r\n\r\nworking  in  their respective fields  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbring  forth  shining and glorious  recognition  of\r\n\r\ntheir  work.  I  would therefore like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  plans  are afoot  to  send  further\r\n\r\ncultural  missions  overseas.  I  think  that   the\r\n\r\nsending  of  cultural  missions  overseas  is  both\r\n\r\nsignificant and meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is related to a symphony\r\n\r\norchestra  for  Singapore. I had  brought  up  this\r\n\r\nquestion  last  year. At that time  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nreply was that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  was prepared to consider this suggestion.  Now,\r\n\r\nafter  a year has elapsed, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  has  he done  in  respect  of  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  Or  has he completely forgotten  about\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point is a question of helping and\r\n\r\nassisting local writers to publish their  works.  I\r\n\r\nhad  similarly  raised this matter last  year.  The\r\n\r\nMinister at that time said that it was a good idea.\r\n\r\nAgain,  a year has passed, and I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister what has happened to this suggestion.\r\n\r\nHas he provided any assistance to local writers  to\r\n\r\npublish their works?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth point concerns the question of\r\n\r\npunctuality.  Sir, in our call  on  our  people  to\r\n\r\neconomise and to be thrifty, I think we should also\r\n\r\nconduct  a campaign on punctuality to cut down  the\r\n\r\nwaste of time. We should spend our precious time in\r\n\r\nproductive  and constructive work. Since  we  have\r\n\r\nconducted various campaigns on Health, Save  Water,\r\n\r\nKeep  Singapore Clean, and Keep Singapore Green,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is need for a campaign on punctuality\r\n\r\nto encourage people to be more punctual. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture will assume the  supervisory\r\n\r\nrole  in  making people realise the importance  and\r\n\r\nthe  advantages  to be obtained by being  punctual.\r\n\r\nThe  idea  is  to  make  our people  cultivate  and\r\n\r\nacquire  the  habit of keeping to time  and  to  be\r\n\r\npunctual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, what effort is being\r\n\r\nmade  to  promote  a Singaporean  culture  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  When  the PAP came to  power  in  1959,\r\n\r\nthere  were  cultural shows like  the  Aneka  Ragam\r\n\r\nshows.  These shows provided a direct link  between\r\n\r\nthe  artistes and the masses. Further, it  went  at\r\n\r\ngreat length towards promoting an understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe other peoples' cultures. Very unfortunately  it\r\n\r\nhas  died out. Even the programmes arranged at  the\r\n\r\nparks here have died out. Why, may I ask, has  this\r\n\r\nbeen allowed to happen? What is the use of building\r\n\r\nstages  at Hong Lim Park, MacRitchie Reservoir  and\r\n\r\nat Seletar Reservoir, if these have been allowed to\r\n\r\nbecome white elephants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the field of art, the open-air Art\r\n\r\nExhibition  held on the first Sunday of each  month\r\n\r\nhas  not been heard, of late. What has happened  to\r\n\r\nthe  Art for Everyone exhibitions that are supposed\r\n\r\nto  tour the community centres? How can we build  a\r\n\r\nsociety  interested in the arts if the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture, which is responsible for the promotion  of\r\n\r\nthese arts, has let these exhibitions and shows  to\r\n\r\ndie out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the young are being forgotten. The Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  organises an art exhibition in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the Youth Festival. But the exhibition is  of\r\n\r\ntoo short a duration and held only once a year. The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture should take the initiative  to\r\n\r\nhold  similar  exhibitions of young peoples'  work,\r\n\r\nand  to hold it more often. These exhibitions could\r\n\r\nthen make a tour of the various community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote further interest in music and art the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture,  in liaison  with  RTS,  can\r\n\r\nintroduce  more documentary films so as to  educate\r\n\r\nour  public. Various aspects of art and  music  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  introduced. Art and music in our  schools\r\n\r\ncan  also  be  encouraged so that our citizens  can\r\n\r\ntake pride in what goes on in present day schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention that some sponsors\r\n\r\nof   art,  after  succeeding  in  inviting  foreign\r\n\r\nartistes  to  perform in Singapore, are  unable  to\r\n\r\nlook after them, such as providing proper food  and\r\n\r\nshelter.  What restriction has the Culture Ministry\r\n\r\nhad  in  mind  for such sponsors?  Are  they  fully\r\n\r\nscreened before a permit is granted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nvarious  Members  have  talked  about  policies  in\r\n\r\nregard  to culture and other matters, but  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to touch upon items like variety shows over TV\r\n\r\ntelecasts.  The Minister explained to us  the  last\r\n\r\ntime why certain shows were permitted. He said that\r\n\r\nshows  like  the  \"Variety  Show\"  and  such   like\r\n\r\nprogrammes were meant to enable people to relax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that we should also allow those\r\n\r\nluxurious  hotels and night clubs to perform  their\r\n\r\nspecial type of decadent dances and music, even the\r\n\r\nshaking  of  fleshy parts. I say so not  because  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to promote such culture or activities,\r\n\r\nbut  to  provide  a certain amount of  latitude  to\r\n\r\nallow the rich and the tycoons to spend their money\r\n\r\nhere  instead  of abroad,. If we do prohibit  night\r\n\r\nclubs  to stage such decadent performances, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister whether or not  our  men\r\n\r\ncould  be  stopped  from going  across  the  Johore\r\n\r\nCauseway to enjoy the naughty shows there. They can\r\n\r\nboard a plane and, after an hour or so, reach their\r\n\r\ndestination  to  enjoy their  glorious  night  life\r\n\r\noverseas. People can do that if they want to.  What\r\n\r\nI  mean  to say is that in this mundane world,  the\r\n\r\nworld of idealism is very far away from what we are\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve at present. We must be practical.\r\n\r\nThe  rich people in Singapore can spend their money\r\n\r\nhere  and enjoy their lives here. If they like they\r\n\r\ncan  go abroad and scatter their money there.  That\r\n\r\nis  something that we cannot prevent. From my point\r\n\r\nof  view,  at  the present juncture  while  we  are\r\n\r\nsubjected to various kinds of economic pressure and\r\n\r\nwhen  our nation building in respect of culture  is\r\n\r\nalso subjected to foreign influence, we ought to be\r\n\r\npractical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Government's restriction prohibiting 18\r\n\r\nyear-olds from going into certain places,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that places like night clubs where  people\r\n\r\ncan  enjoy  decadent pastimes  should  be  open  to\r\n\r\neveryone who can afford to enjoy themselves  there,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the condition that the Government  can\r\n\r\nlevy  very  high admission charges or entertainment\r\n\r\nduties  so that our money will not flow abroad.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way  the few rich people who can fly overseas\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  their weekends can also well  afford  to\r\n\r\nspend their money here in Singapore, so that we can\r\n\r\nbenefit  in  greater revenue.  If  there  are  rich\r\n\r\nforeigners who want to go around various places  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the scenery, they can also throw their  gold\r\n\r\non these night\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclubs or other places of resort in Singapore. After\r\n\r\nsaying  all these, I do not mean to say that  I  am\r\n\r\ninterested   in  promoting  yellowish  or   grayish\r\n\r\nculture.  What  I  mean  is  that,  since  we   are\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  foreign cultural influence  and  our\r\n\r\ninfluence on others is less than theirs is  on  us,\r\n\r\nwe  might perhaps choose the more practical way  to\r\n\r\nsolve this problem so that our people need not have\r\n\r\nto  go abroad to spend their money. If people  want\r\n\r\nto  spend their glorious nights here, they can have\r\n\r\nsuch a facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  Singapore should  also  allow  such\r\n\r\ndecadent programmes to be broadcast. We should give\r\n\r\nour  children interesting shows than those for mere\r\n\r\nenjoyment. The music in Chinese shows like  Ta  Min\r\n\r\nand Seow Min, is not particularly beneficial to our\r\n\r\nyoung  people.  So  I would like  to  propose  some\r\n\r\nmeasures for the Minister to consider. In  view  of\r\n\r\nour  present  particular situation, to formulate  a\r\n\r\nkind of two sided cultural policies -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Katong rising on\r\n\r\na point of order or clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I would just like to ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Member could speak a  little  slower,\r\n\r\nbecause I find his speech extremely interesting.

However,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  expression  is  far  nicer  than  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  translation. So I hope  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture can give a better rendering to this Chinese\r\n\r\nexpression so that the English translation  can  be\r\n\r\nas beautiful and fitting as the Chinese title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than what I have said just now, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  has  in  recent  years  been\r\n\r\npromoting  and  encouraging performances,  such  as\r\n\r\n\"Music for Everyone\" series which are cultural  and\r\n\r\nartistic   activities.  This  will   provide   good\r\n\r\nmaterial for the TV department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a\r\n\r\npity  that  the previous speaker took a little  bit\r\n\r\nseriously   the  injunction  of  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang to be punctual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, may I just comment on some of\r\n\r\nthe  remarks made regarding the unhealthy  pursuits\r\n\r\nto which our young people and others are exposed to\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the   dearth  of   better   cultural\r\n\r\nopportunities. I think the Ministry of Culture  has\r\n\r\ndone  a  great deal to fill in the gap but perhaps,\r\n\r\nespecially because of a lack of financial  support,\r\n\r\nit  has  not been able to do as much as  it  should\r\n\r\nhave done or could have done. But when we think  in\r\n\r\nterms    of   trying   to   offer   people   better\r\n\r\nopportunities to understand or to indulge  in  some\r\n\r\ncultural  pursuits, perhaps a better  understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  cultural environment would  contribute  to\r\n\r\ntaking  them away from interest in something  which\r\n\r\nhas  less  cultural value. I have brought  up  this\r\n\r\npoint  previously, Sir, regarding  encouraging  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  know  their  own environment  a  little\r\n\r\nbetter,  and even the question of their, knowing  a\r\n\r\nlittle   bit   of  the  history  of  our   country,\r\n\r\ninteresting  historical places, and the interesting\r\n\r\nstories  behind  these  places,  and  in  this  way\r\n\r\ncultivating a sense of belonging to this  place.  I\r\n\r\nthink  if we can encourage this a little bit  more,\r\n\r\nthere  can gradually be built a feeling of  greater\r\n\r\nbelonging, a feeling of greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  in  history and cultural development  and\r\n\r\nthe  roots which we have in our own environment.  I\r\n\r\nremember  the  Minister for Culture said,  in  last\r\n\r\nyear's debate on the Budget, that he thought it was\r\n\r\na  good idea to encourage talks and lectures on our\r\n\r\nhistorical  places. But I have not seen  any  great\r\n\r\nmultiplication  of opportunities of  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nthing  either over the air or through the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  or  some other organisation.  This  is\r\n\r\njust  a small point. But I think that since we  are\r\n\r\nreally  in  need  of  cultural  encouragement   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  every little thing adds  to  the  sum\r\n\r\ntotal of our achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also brought up the question of cross-fertilisation of cultures and getting people from\r\n\r\none culture to understand the background of another\r\n\r\nculture.  The Minister also agreed that  it  was  a\r\n\r\ngood idea. Of course, he had some reservations  and\r\n\r\nthese  were our lack of personnel and their ability\r\n\r\nto carry forward programmes of this nature. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask him whether he has made any effort  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  such personnel. My experience  last  year,\r\n\r\nafter  I  had made some comments about the lack  of\r\n\r\nsuch  opportunities, was that I was interviewed  by\r\n\r\nsomebody from the Broadcasting Department  who  was\r\n\r\nactually  trying to discredit what I had  said.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  he concocted a programme which attempted  to\r\n\r\ndiscredit  what  I  said about cross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nBut  in that very programme, he showed Ravi Shankar\r\n\r\nplaying  his  instrument with lots of explanations,\r\n\r\nwhich  was, in fact, a proof of the correctness  of\r\n\r\nwhat  I  had  said.  The Minister  himself  agreed.\r\n\r\nFortunately  for  the  Ministry  of  Culture,  this\r\n\r\nperson  is  now no more in the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\nbut peddling stocks and shares in the stock market.\r\n\r\nHe has removed himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I think could be\r\n\r\nraised  in  regard to the encouragement of  greater\r\n\r\ncultural  participation. I have mentioned  that  we\r\n\r\nwant to get something that is indigenous, something\r\n\r\nthat we can feel we belong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto.  I think more encouragement should be given  to\r\n\r\nour  people to compose music that is related to our\r\n\r\nenvironment,  to choreograph a dance that  is  more\r\n\r\nrelated  to  our  environment, or  to  write  short\r\n\r\nliterary  plays on topics that are related  to  our\r\n\r\ncultural  environment. I think this could  be  done\r\n\r\nthrough  competitions sponsored by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture,  and we should have more of these  things.\r\n\r\nSurely  we  could get sponsors for these programmes\r\n\r\nand,  if  it is necessary, the Ministry of  Culture\r\n\r\ncould  try and try again, because we should not  be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged if our initial efforts do not meet with\r\n\r\nadequate  response.  We  should  try  to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  participate in these  competitions.  At\r\n\r\nsome   juncture  I  think  we  will   produce   the\r\n\r\noccasional person who may strike a happy harmony in\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has to offer to the other people  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety. If I may quote an English poet:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark\r\n\r\nunfathomed caves of ocean bare.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If I may also resort to an image with which Members\r\n\r\nhave become a little more familiar recently:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And\r\n\r\nwaste its sweetness on the desert air.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  we  want, of course, those things to emerge  - the flower and the gem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  have  a very good infrastructure where cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment    is    concerned.    The     physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  is there. What  we  lack  is  maybe\r\n\r\nfinance,  but we have a Ministry of Culture  and  a\r\n\r\nhardworking  Minister. In many countries,  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  even have a Ministry of Culture. They  have  a\r\n\r\nMinistry  which  is  allied  to  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation or some other Ministry, like Information.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  a Ministry of Culture, and  we  have\r\n\r\nother  aspects of infrastructure, like the National\r\n\r\nTheatre  and the People's Association. I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  use all these devices and tools to  further\r\n\r\npursue our cultural policy more vigorously. What we\r\n\r\nneed  more,  particularly, is money.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture should in no  doubtful  terms\r\n\r\nplace their requirements firmly before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance so that we can get money to\r\n\r\nimplement our cultural programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in the coming financial  year,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has allotted more than $10  million  to\r\n\r\npromote colour TV, and there is also a plan to have\r\n\r\na  trial  run of colour TV before the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear. I remember last year Backbenchers raised  the\r\n\r\nquestion  as to when colour TV would be introduced,\r\n\r\nand the Minister answered that the Government could\r\n\r\nintroduce  colour  TV at any moment.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nalso  stated  that  if we did  so,  we  would  only\r\n\r\nincrease  our social burden. But at the  time  when\r\n\r\nthe  Minister gave such a reply we were in a  state\r\n\r\nof  prosperity economically. Now, however,  we  are\r\n\r\nunder   inflationary  pressures  and  our  economic\r\n\r\nprogress  will be slowed down. Therefore, I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether it is timely to introduce colour TV  within\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  would like to support  what  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tiong Bahru has just said, because  even\r\n\r\nrecently  the  Monetary Authority of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalso given orders to the various banks -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> On\r\n\r\na  point  of  order,  Sir.

Everybody has  a\r\n\r\nsoul,  a country has its soul too, a national soul.\r\n\r\nIn  the promotion of culture, we have never had any\r\n\r\nplans. Recently two cultural missions were supposed\r\n\r\nto  go  overseas, one to Germany and the  other  to\r\n\r\nJapan.  In  Germany, posters were  put  up  in  the\r\n\r\nstreets informing the people there of the visit  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore cultural mission for a  performance.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the same publicity was given over TV, and\r\n\r\neven the Japanese newspapers announced the visit of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  cultural  mission.  But  at  the  last\r\n\r\nmoment, the two trips were cancelled. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  the person responsible was aware of  this.\r\n\r\nEven  the high authorities, I think, are not  aware\r\n\r\nof this. There were enquiries from an Embassy as to\r\n\r\nwhy  the trip was cancelled. Is the Minister  aware\r\n\r\nof this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion when the person in charge of the\r\n\r\ncultural  delegation went to  the  airport  to  get\r\n\r\ntickets for the delegation, he was told that  there\r\n\r\nwere  no  tickets available because  the  trip  was\r\n\r\ncancelled.   This   kind  of  haphazard   makeshift\r\n\r\narrangement speaks ill of the cultural plans and it\r\n\r\nhas dealt a great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblow  to  cultural  activities. We  have  not  done\r\n\r\nenough  in  regard  to  giving  publicity  to   our\r\n\r\ncultural activities or heritage. We should not just\r\n\r\ninform  other countries that we have Bugis  Street,\r\n\r\nor  that we have a Surrender Chamber. So since they\r\n\r\nknow  very  little about our cultural heritage,  we\r\n\r\nshould  give  further publicity to  our  claims  on\r\n\r\ntraditional cultures, the cream of our heritage. We\r\n\r\nshould afford opportunities for our cultures to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  other  countries  which  are   very\r\n\r\ninterested in our cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our cultural missions went abroad there was\r\n\r\nusually  a  representation  of  mixed  cultures   -\r\n\r\nIndian,  Chinese, Malay and even Western  cultures.\r\n\r\nSome  Iranians have been asking why we do not  send\r\n\r\nour cultural missions to their country. Since there\r\n\r\nare many countries which are very interested in our\r\n\r\nculture,  why  do  we not avail ourselves  of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  give  greater  publicity  to   our\r\n\r\nculture  abroad? Instead we just publicise the  bad\r\n\r\naspects  of  our country. Recently I returned  from\r\n\r\nGeneva.  I received a Singapore publicity  pamphlet\r\n\r\non   tourism,  it  states  that  there   are   some\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore which can be found  for  24\r\n\r\nhours. The best activities will be from 7 p.m, to 7\r\n\r\na.m.,  especially after midnight. It also  gives  a\r\n\r\ndescription  of  certain  streets  which  are  most\r\n\r\ninteresting and places which are of interest. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether it was published by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture,  the Tourist Promotion Board  or  some\r\n\r\nother  organisation.  It  also  mentions  that   in\r\n\r\nSingapore there are two languages and that  certain\r\n\r\nstreets  have Indian names. This kind of  statement\r\n\r\nis  misleading because in Singapore there are  four\r\n\r\nofficial languages. Certain streets are named after\r\n\r\ncertain  people.  In  publicising  our  culture  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  proper  systematic  and  long-term\r\n\r\nplanning. We should not allow our culture  to  sink\r\n\r\nor  float by itself. This is not very good for  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  I hope the Minister for Culture will  try\r\n\r\nto  get as much funds for cultural activities as he\r\n\r\ncan  so  as to enrich our cultural heritage and  to\r\n\r\nincrease our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublicity abroad in regard to our cultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much\r\n\r\nof what Members have raised had already been raised\r\n\r\nlast  year.  In fact, I suspect that some  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  been lifted from last year's Hansard.  It  is\r\n\r\nfilling  new bottles with old wine -- Sin pin  chiu\r\n\r\nchiu.  It is only that the wine is a bit sour  now.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  should  reply to some  of  the  points\r\n\r\nraised by the Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must come to our old Friend, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang. He has complained,  first  of  all,\r\n\r\nabout the programmes over the TV. I agree with  him\r\n\r\nthat to a certain extent some of our programmes are\r\n\r\nnot up to our expectations. But I must mention that\r\n\r\nmost  of  our  programmes are imported  from  other\r\n\r\ncountries. We cannot actually have whatever we want\r\n\r\nbecause  in  some  cases we are fed  with  whatever\r\n\r\nfilms that come to us. Sometimes it is not possible\r\n\r\nto  put  in, what you call, the healthy educational\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   I   myself   sometimes   feel   quite\r\n\r\nembarrassed  whenever i watch those  mystery  films\r\n\r\ndepicting crime, robbery, and so on. But apart from\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes, what else can we get? We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  film  industry, and we depend  very  much,\r\n\r\nespecially Chinese films, on Hong Kong and  Taiwan.\r\n\r\nThese are the films which we get commercially  from\r\n\r\nthese two places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, educational and informative programmes\r\n\r\nhave all along formed the highest percentage of the\r\n\r\noverall  output on television. Last year, 22.9  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the average weekly output was educational\r\n\r\nand  informative. This year, up to March, 1974, the\r\n\r\naverage   weekly  output  in  this   category   has\r\n\r\nincreased  to  23.2  per  cent.  Of  the   imported\r\n\r\nprogrammes, excluding feature films, programmes  of\r\n\r\neducational value comprised 12.64 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  weekly output. Therefore, TV Singapore  is\r\n\r\nby  far  the largest user of documentaries in  this\r\n\r\nregion. At present the average weekly output of RTS\r\n\r\nlocally-produced films classified as educational or\r\n\r\ninformative  is  53.82 per cent. This,  of  course,\r\n\r\nincludes  newsreels, magazines and  public  affairs\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that the function of television\r\n\r\nis  not just to educate the people. If all we  want\r\n\r\nis educational programmes, then we can always scrap\r\n\r\nTV and run only the ETV. But we have other purposes\r\n\r\ntoo,  and  that  is to inform and to entertain  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson has also mentioned that\r\n\r\nwe  need  some  relaxation after work.  The  people\r\n\r\nshould have some relaxation, and so - Hua yeh liang\r\n\r\nseow.  It  is a bit \"soft\", I agree, but I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  would  cause any harm.  If  our  young\r\n\r\npeople  are  so weak that to watch a  variety  show\r\n\r\njust  once  a week weakens them to such an  extent,\r\n\r\nthen T think it is really a hopeless situation  and\r\n\r\nall efforts at nation building, discipline, and  so\r\n\r\non should be scrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised many points.\r\n\r\nFirst,  he  has asked that, if possible, we  should\r\n\r\norganise cultural festivals. Of course, if we  have\r\n\r\nthe  money, we will do so. He also wants us to  set\r\n\r\nup   a   committee  to  supervise  the   television\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  We  have  actually  such  a  committee\r\n\r\nsupervising these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> He wants to be a member!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> There is the Film Acquisition\r\n\r\nCommittee. I think they are doing their best to try\r\n\r\nto  get  good programmes but, as I have  said  just\r\n\r\nnow,  good programmes are difficult to get. He also\r\n\r\nwants  us to subsidise local cultural organisations\r\n\r\nby  waiving  rent  for use of  theatres  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces. That is rather difficult, because once  you\r\n\r\ndo  that, then everyone will start jumping  on  the\r\n\r\nband  wagon,  and it would then not be possible  to\r\n\r\nmaintain our theatres properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the Member for Sembawang also asked\r\n\r\nabout colour television.

In fact, the debate should\r\n\r\nproperly  come up under Head JA, subhead  CA  3001,\r\n\r\nColour  Television,  in the Development  Estimates.\r\n\r\nBut  since there is no amendment under that subhead\r\n\r\nand  since  the  Minister is  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\noverall policy, perhaps what we can do is this.  If\r\n\r\nthe Minister wants to answer that point now, he may\r\n\r\ncarry  on,  and then later I will allow the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan Kayu to say his piece. There  can  be  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on it and the Minister can  then  speak\r\n\r\nagain.  If that is all right, please carry  on,  Mr\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> What I want to mention here is\r\n\r\nonly the technical `detail about colour television.\r\n\r\nAs to the criticism -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, may I again interrupt\r\n\r\nyou?  If  it  is,  in fact, a matter  of  technical\r\n\r\ndetail  and  not on policy, then perhaps  it  could\r\n\r\ncome under Broadcasting. However, if it is a matter\r\n\r\nof  general policy - whether or not we are going to\r\n\r\nhave colour television -then please carry on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I would rather wait until the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampung Kembangan moves his amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nregard  to  sending cultural troupes overseas,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture has no plans to send a cultural\r\n\r\ntroupe  overseas  this year. However,  there  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility  that  a  cultural  troupe  may  go  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  this  year because the  members  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  are contemplating  to  send  a\r\n\r\ngoodwill  mission  to  Indonesia,  and  they   have\r\n\r\ninvited  our cultural troupe to form part  of  this\r\n\r\ngoodwill  mission.  If this proposal  materialises,\r\n\r\nthe  cultural troupe will give performances in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Indonesia this year.  The  matter  is\r\n\r\nstill  under  consideration as plans have  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen finalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has raised a point about\r\n\r\nsending a cultural troupe to Germany and Japan, but\r\n\r\nwas later scrapped. I must inform him that actually\r\n\r\nthis  trip  was not part of our cultural programme.\r\n\r\nWe  were invited by the Tourist Promotion Board  to\r\n\r\nsend  a troupe to promote tourism, not culture.  We\r\n\r\nresponded by giving our dancers intensive  training\r\n\r\nto prepare them for the trip. But later the Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  found  that  the  cost  was   too\r\n\r\nprohibitive  and withdrew their support.  So  there\r\n\r\nwas  nothing  we  could do about  it,  It  was  the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board that had asked us to send a\r\n\r\ntroupe  there, and when they found that they  could\r\n\r\nnot  afford  it,  they had to withdraw.  Sending  a\r\n\r\ntroupe overseas requires a lot of money. Of course,\r\n\r\nit  would  contribute greatly to the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's culture, but I would rather  spend  the\r\n\r\nmoney  in Singapore on our own artistes and on  our\r\n\r\nown people than promoting shows for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> As regards the brochure\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Member, I do not  think  it  was\r\n\r\nprinted  by  my  Ministry.  I  think  it  has  also\r\n\r\nsomething  to do with the Tourist Promotion  Board.\r\n\r\nSo I need not elaborate on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a symphony orchestra, this\r\n\r\nmatter  was also raised last year. The answer  will\r\n\r\nstill be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  because a symphony orchestra costs money.  If\r\n\r\nwe are to start a national symphony orchestra, then\r\n\r\nit  should  be of a sufficiently high  standard  to\r\n\r\nwarrant   it  to  be  called  a  national  symphony\r\n\r\norchestra. To achieve this, it is necessary to have\r\n\r\na  number of musicians of the required standard and\r\n\r\nfor this we will have to recruit quite a number  of\r\n\r\nthem from abroad and to pay them well. It will cost\r\n\r\na  lot  of  money  to maintain such  an  orchestra.\r\n\r\nSeveral  years  ago,  the  National  Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nstarted  a  symphony  orchestra  but  it  ran  into\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties and, therefore, had  to  be\r\n\r\nabandoned. In view of this experience, we are very,\r\n\r\nvery  careful  now  if  we  have  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nprospect of starting another one. I think we  still\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  for our budding musicians  to  come\r\n\r\nforward,  so  that we can at least  start  a  small\r\n\r\nchamber ensemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assistance to local writers, again I\r\n\r\nhad  already  pointed out to the Member  last  year\r\n\r\nwhen   he  raised  the  same  question,  that   our\r\n\r\npopulation of two million cannot support  them.  It\r\n\r\nis  rather  difficult for people to make  a  living\r\n\r\npurely  by  writing. However, if our local  writers\r\n\r\ncan   produce  any  work  of  a  sufficiently  high\r\n\r\nstandard, they should have no difficulty in getting\r\n\r\ntheir   works   published.   The   National    Book\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Council  on  which  my  Ministry   is\r\n\r\nrepresented  tries  its best to give  encouragement\r\n\r\nand  assistance  to local writers. Book  awards  in\r\n\r\nChinese  were first inaugurated by the  Council  in\r\n\r\n1972,  but  none of the 1972 entries was  found  to\r\n\r\nsufficiently  qualify for the  award.  The  Council\r\n\r\nhopes to inaugurate similar awards for Malay, Tamil\r\n\r\nand   English  language  efforts  once  funds   are\r\n\r\navailable.  I also understand that the Council,  in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the  Singapore  Book  Publishers\r\n\r\nAssociation,  is in the process of  establishing  a\r\n\r\nWriters'  Association. I think this is a good  move\r\n\r\nand  the  Council should be congratulated  for  its\r\n\r\ngood work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of punctuality, I have no idea\r\n\r\nthat  my  portfolio includes punctuality campaigns.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think it is really a waste of time  and\r\n\r\nmoney  to  launch  such  a campaign.  The  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation had in 1968 launched such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  campaign, but it fizzled out after a few months,\r\n\r\nwithout  achieving any significant  effect.  It  is\r\n\r\nquite  simple  to  make  a  person  punctual.  Much\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the circumstances he is  asked  to  be\r\n\r\npunctual. If it concerns his work, he has got to he\r\n\r\npunctual because he knows that he will be penalised\r\n\r\neither  by suffering a pay-cut or a reprimand  from\r\n\r\nthe  boss. If it is a date with his girl friend,  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure he is quite punctual. Otherwise  he\r\n\r\nwill  lose  his girl friend. In the case of  dinner\r\n\r\nparties,  this  is  not  a  very  important  matter\r\n\r\nbecause if he is not punctual, he will either  miss\r\n\r\nhis food or have less to eat. I do not think it  is\r\n\r\nreally necessary to bring this up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must come now to the Member for Henderson\r\n\r\nbecause he has spoken at length on the variety show\r\n\r\nentitled  Hua  yeh  liang seow on television.  This\r\n\r\nprogramme has been a thorn in our flesh. If we  can\r\n\r\nscrap  it  we  would escape from  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncriticisms by MPs who are trying to be puritanical.\r\n\r\nAfter  all this variety show comes on only  once  a\r\n\r\nweek. If we can have those programmes in the night-clubs for the very well-to-do, then why can we  not\r\n\r\nhave  some  for  the not so well-to-do  people,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can also enjoy and relax? We should  be\r\n\r\nrealistic.  Since  they need some relaxation,  then\r\n\r\nalthough those songs would not raise the morale  of\r\n\r\nyoung  people in nation-building they can at  least\r\n\r\ngive  them some form of relaxation. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the title Hua yeh liang seow is proper  or\r\n\r\nnot,  but  the  title has been at the  tip  of  the\r\n\r\ntongue  of  many people who are familiar with  this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that we should\r\n\r\nbuild a Singaporean culture. It takes time to build\r\n\r\na Singaporean culture. It cannot be created in just\r\n\r\n15  years,  because  we have been  independent  for\r\n\r\nabout  only 15 years now. He has also said that  we\r\n\r\nhave allowed the Aneka Ragam show to die out. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think it is true because we have called it  by\r\n\r\nanother name. We do not call it Aneka Ragam, but we\r\n\r\ncall  it  a  cultural show. In 1972,  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre Trust presented some cultural shows at Hong\r\n\r\nLim  Park,  MacRitchie Reservoir and at  the  other\r\n\r\nusual places. In 1973,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association started  its  series  of\r\n\r\ncultural shows for the people. Up to now, about  15\r\n\r\nsuch  shows  have been staged at community  centres\r\n\r\nand at other public places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open air art exhibition was started by the\r\n\r\nNational   Theatre  Trust  in  1968  but   it   was\r\n\r\ndiscontinued  because  of  lack  of  support.   But\r\n\r\nrecently  the  Ministry of Culture has reintroduced\r\n\r\nthis  activity, and this time it is for  the  young\r\n\r\nartists.  We found that it was very successful  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of this, we have decided to continue  with\r\n\r\nthis  open air exhibition at regular intervals  of,\r\n\r\nsay, two to three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Art for Everyone, this series of\r\n\r\nexhibitions has been going on. It is not dead.  The\r\n\r\nonly  thing is that it takes time to go  round  all\r\n\r\nthe 65 constituencies. I am quite sure one of these\r\n\r\ndays  it will come to the community centre at Anson\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Anson will be asked to open it.\r\n\r\nSo  far we have already held about 19 of these  Art\r\n\r\nfor  Everyone exhibitions in community  centres  in\r\n\r\nvarious   constituencies.  Besides  the   Art   for\r\n\r\nEveryone  exhibition, the Ministry of Culture  also\r\n\r\norganises  the  National Day Art  and  Photographic\r\n\r\nExhibition every year. In April last year, a  young\r\n\r\npeople's  art  gallery which  can  accommodate  200\r\n\r\npieces  of  art  work was started at  the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum.  It  is a permanent art gallery to  exhibit\r\n\r\nthe  work  of our young people ranging  from  those\r\n\r\nattending   kindergarten  classes   to   those   in\r\n\r\nsecondary schools and vocational institutes. School\r\n\r\nstudents who are good in art can submit their  work\r\n\r\nfor  consideration of display at the  gallery,  and\r\n\r\nexhibits  displayed  are  changed  once  in   three\r\n\r\nmonths.  Also,  early  this year  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  began  a  new series  of  concerts  called\r\n\r\n\"Concerts  for the Young\". It is aimed at featuring\r\n\r\nour  young  budding musicians and to  provide  them\r\n\r\nwith an opportunity to perform in public. This is a\r\n\r\nmonthly   concert  held  at  the  National  Library\r\n\r\nlecture  hall, and admission is free. From this  we\r\n\r\ncan say that our young people are not neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Radio and Television Singapore has done its\r\n\r\npart in the promotion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultural  programmes.  Whenever possible, the RTS introduces  such  programmes,\r\n\r\neither of local artistes or artistes from overseas. Currently, the RTS produces\r\n\r\na programme known as Art Appreciation which is being telecast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About foreign artistes who have been asked to come in and then forgotten, the\r\n\r\nsponsors of these artistes are responsible for their welfare in this country. I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  there  is  nothing  very much we can  do  about  this  because  the\r\n\r\nperformers  are normally brought in under private arrangement and  are  usually\r\n\r\npromoted on a commercial basis. In many cases, there is some sort of a contract\r\n\r\nbetween  the sponsors and the promoters. I believe that if they are allowed  to\r\n\r\nenter Singapore, the sponsors have to satisfy the Controller of Immigration. If\r\n\r\nthey  abscond  or  neglect  the welfare of their artistes,  the  Controller  of\r\n\r\nImmigration would stop them from coming in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
