Today I wish\r\n\r\nto emphasise a few matters on Home Affairs that are\r\n\r\ncontained in the policy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the promulgation of the new Constitution of\r\n\r\ninternal self-government and the formation  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  internal self-government, we the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  entered into a new  historic  era.\r\n\r\nThis  is an important transitional period.  On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  the symbols of Colonial  rules  are  on\r\n\r\ntheir  way out and on the other hand is a  new-born\r\n\r\nanti-Colonial  self-government  of  the   people - an\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government of limited powers.  Since\r\n\r\nthe masses of the people have handed this power  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government, they have, at the same time,\r\n\r\nentrusted us their future happiness. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust  put  our feet on the ground and shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that the people have entrusted us.\r\n\r\nOf  course in an island of 225 square miles with  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  1\u00bd  million  people  relying   on\r\n\r\nentrepot  for our livelihood, it is by no means  an\r\n\r\neasy  task  to  carry  out  socialist  policy   and\r\n\r\nsocialist   re-construction.   The   P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly announced their long-term objective that\r\n\r\nonly  through a thorough socialist reform  and  re-construction  can we improve and raise  the  living\r\n\r\nstandards  of the people. In order to achieve  this\r\n\r\nwe  must  pave the road for an early re-unification\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation of Malaya. It is only  through\r\n\r\nmerger with the Federation to become a State in  an\r\n\r\nindependent  country that we  can  have  the  basic\r\n\r\nconditions  for  the establishment of  a  socialist\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the power of internal self-government is\r\n\r\nalready  in the hands of the people today, we  must\r\n\r\nfully  utilise this advantageous political position\r\n\r\nto do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nour  best  during  our  term of  office  to  create\r\n\r\nconditions favourable to an early merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. We must make our strife  for\r\n\r\nnational  re-unification  the  most  pressing   and\r\n\r\nimportant task of the P.A.P. Government. We  should\r\n\r\nnot forget that over and above the government there\r\n\r\nis  the Internal Security Council which decides  on\r\n\r\ninternal   security   matters  affecting   external\r\n\r\ndefence. Therefore every responsible citizen should\r\n\r\nbe  fully aware of this fact so that we may do  our\r\n\r\nwork in a cautious and realistic manner. We wish to\r\n\r\nemphasise that rash adventurism, here and now,  can\r\n\r\nonly  bring  unfortunate consequences  to  the  new\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Of  course,  we  hope  the  Federation\r\n\r\nmember  on  the  Internal  Security  Council   will\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  desires  and  aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mass Party in a predominantly Chinese city,\r\n\r\nwe  must  adopt  the most dynamic  and  imaginative\r\n\r\nsteps   in   carrying  out  our  task  of  national\r\n\r\nconstruction.  We  should  point  out   early   re-unification is to the mutual interests and benefits\r\n\r\nof  the people of the Federation and Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in carrying out this work in order to reach\r\n\r\nour  objective, a small section of the people  will\r\n\r\nalways  oppose  us  and show their dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Government  must consider  the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests of the State as a whole. The interests of\r\n\r\na  small section of the people must be subordinated\r\n\r\nto  the interests of the majority of the people - the\r\n\r\nMalays, Chinese and Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the problem of law and order and in\r\n\r\ndealing with crimes and secret societies, we should\r\n\r\nnot   overlook  their  basic  social  and  economic\r\n\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the former Government was being\r\n\r\ninept  in  tackling  the problem  of  unemployment.\r\n\r\nCertain  Assemblymen  and even Assistant  Ministers\r\n\r\nwere  seen  mixing up with secret society gangsters\r\n\r\nand   had  no  hesitation  in  making  use  of  the\r\n\r\ngangsters  in  order to achieve their own  personal\r\n\r\nends.  All these point to the fact that crimes  and\r\n\r\nsecret society\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities  have,  to  a certain  extent,  received\r\n\r\nofficial patronage. The P.A.P. Government will adopt\r\n\r\na  positive  attitude in tackling  these  problems.\r\n\r\nRegarding  our  long-term measures, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  already  announced that it  will  take  active\r\n\r\nsteps  to  expand  industries so that  the  factors\r\n\r\ncontributing   to  criminal  and   secret   society\r\n\r\nactivities,  i.e., unemployment, would be  improved\r\n\r\nand  gradually solved. In the immediate future, the\r\n\r\npeople will be encouraged to organise themselves to\r\n\r\ncombat  gangsterism, and the Police Force  will  be\r\n\r\nreorganised  and  strengthened and  its  efficiency\r\n\r\nraised.  At the same time, we intend to  amend  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Laws so that the authorities will be  able\r\n\r\nto   punish  more  severely,  those  convicted   of\r\n\r\ncreating   public  disorders.  In  tackling   these\r\n\r\nproblems, the Government will pay special attention\r\n\r\nto  more  constructive measures in  protecting  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of the people and stopping the crime  wave.\r\n\r\nIn fact, from last month the Government has already\r\n\r\ntaken measures to stop those activities leading  to\r\n\r\ncrimes,  namely,  yellow  culture,  juke-boxes  and\r\n\r\npintable  saloons.  We will actively  continue  our\r\n\r\ncampaign  in this direction. Also our prisons  will\r\n\r\nbe  reformed so that more emphasis will be laid  on\r\n\r\nthe rehabilitation of the criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of immigration, we have to consider\r\n\r\ncarefully the problem of increasing unemployment in\r\n\r\nthe country. During the past few years, the average\r\n\r\nnumber  of  immigrants per year is  6,000.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of this year, however, the  number  of\r\n\r\nimmigrants has exceeded 4,000. It is estimated that\r\n\r\nby  the  end of the year, the number will  probably\r\n\r\nreach  10,000. Add to it will be another 10,000  or\r\n\r\nmore people per year coming from the Federation  to\r\n\r\nlive   in   Singapore.  The  problem   is   further\r\n\r\naggravated   by  the  startling  rate  of   natural\r\n\r\nincrease of the population. All these point to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  if we allow this situation to  develop,\r\n\r\nthen   our   unemployment  problem  is   going   to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate further and our entire national economy\r\n\r\nwill    undoubtedly   be   faced    with    greater\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale immigration will not only worsen our\r\n\r\nunemployment and population problems  but  it  will\r\n\r\nalso   create  political  problems.  How   can   we\r\n\r\nassimilate these new immigrants whose thinking  and\r\n\r\noutlook  are  not Malayan and how do we  instil  in\r\n\r\nthem Malayan loyalty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a Government elected by a great majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people to serve their interests.  We  must\r\n\r\ngive  prior  consideration to the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. In order to avoid a worsening\r\n\r\nof   the   unemployment  situation,  we  must,   of\r\n\r\nnecessity, adopt a more restrictive attitude in the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  immigration, so that more opportunities\r\n\r\nmay be given to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the People's Action Party, in accepting the\r\n\r\nmandate to form a Government have long ago realised\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be facing these grave and  difficult\r\n\r\nproblems. However, we have a disciplined party  and\r\n\r\na   concrete  political  programme,  and  with  the\r\n\r\ncontinuous  support  of the  great  masses  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  we  are confident that in  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears, the new Government will be able to lead  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore one step closer to a peaceful,\r\n\r\nhappy and democratic Socialist Malaya!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I give my full support to the  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister.  Before  the\r\n\r\nelections,  our  Party  clearly  made   known   our\r\n\r\npolicies to the electorate so that the people could\r\n\r\nmake their choice. For instance, in connection with\r\n\r\nour  policy on women even before the election,  our\r\n\r\nParty  had  clearly enunciated its policy.  In  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement,  we have very clearly  explained\r\n\r\nthe  conditions  that are faced  by  women  in  our\r\n\r\npresent  society  and also what we  will  be  doing\r\n\r\nafter we have been returned to power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that in the old decadent society,\r\n\r\ncertain  men,  because of their  wealth  and  their\r\n\r\npower,   frequently  had  three  wives   and   four\r\n\r\nconcubines  and,  as  a  result  of  this,   family\r\n\r\ntragedies were always the order of the day. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  great  insult to the dignity  of  women.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, there are certain women who do not dare  to\r\n\r\nface  reality, and because of the pressure  mounted\r\n\r\nagainst  them by social conditions and  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that they have been denied opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  education, perhaps, for instance, some of them\r\n\r\nfeel that because of the comfortable life given  to\r\n\r\nthem therefore they are prepared to accept the life\r\n\r\nof  a  concubine of some rich man. We are going  to\r\n\r\neducate such women so that they will realise  their\r\n\r\nown  dignity.  We  will make them discard  the  old\r\n\r\nluxurious  way  of  living. We will  make  them  no\r\n\r\nlonger  desirous of having a comfortable  luxurious\r\n\r\nlife. We want them to be women of a new society. We\r\n\r\nalso  hope that sensible men will also realise that\r\n\r\na system of multiple wives will fail to create more\r\n\r\nfamily  happiness and there will be  no  peace,  so\r\n\r\nthat  wives  and children will all be fighting  one\r\n\r\nanother, as a result of which tragedies will arise.\r\n\r\nWe  are  going  to  encourage women  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nkitchen  and  ask them actively to  participate  in\r\n\r\npolitical  activities to struggle  for  the  rights\r\n\r\nthat  belong to the women. We will ask  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  creches to be put up  so  that  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  women  may be  able  to  leave  their\r\n\r\nchildren  in these creches and they can  peacefully\r\n\r\ndo  their work outside. Further, we are going to do\r\n\r\nour  utmost  to protect women from being  exploited\r\n\r\nand  harmed, and we will investigate the conditions\r\n\r\nof  women  working  in  bars and  other  places  of\r\n\r\nentertainment.  We  are going to  punish  seriously\r\n\r\nthose  who  entice women to take part  in  unlawful\r\n\r\nactivities.  At  the same time,  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nincrease the scope of possibilities for women to be\r\n\r\nemployed  and we will do our best to see  that  the\r\n\r\nwages  paid to women are not lower than  men's  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  investigate  the conditions  under  which\r\n\r\nwomen are compelled to work overtime.

The Member for Cairnhill said that he is a\r\n\r\ntrade union leader, but has he ever thought that if\r\n\r\nwe  allow several more unions of the same trade  to\r\n\r\nbe  registered, what kind of position or status the\r\n\r\nworkers  will  have  in  their  negotiations   with\r\n\r\nemployers? If he had thought of this point, perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  would not have said that during the period when\r\n\r\nhis  Party was in power, they would simply register\r\n\r\nany union that wished to be registered.

On that  day\r\n\r\nall  the  people  in  Singapore, by  constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans of evolution, voted our 43 Members into power\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly. We will follow the wishes of  the\r\n\r\npeople and will do our best to implement our  Five-Year  plan. Furthermore, we will establish a happy,\r\n\r\nprosperous and good Singapore. We will do our  best\r\n\r\nto merge with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the former Government superficially was\r\n\r\nprosperous and built good buildings for the people,\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of the people was poor. This kind of\r\n\r\nthinking could be thought of only by them  but  not\r\n\r\nby  us; we think differently. The rich live in  big\r\n\r\nhouses, ride in cars; whereas the poor people  live\r\n\r\nin  cottages and sometimes cannot even enjoy  their\r\n\r\ndaily  three meals with satisfaction. We will unite\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to work peacefully in order\r\n\r\nto build a happy, egalitarian Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past hundred years the people had been\r\n\r\noppressed   by  the  colonial  rulers   and   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  was difficult and although they  worked\r\n\r\nvery  hard they could not improve their livelihood,\r\n\r\nnot   to   mention  the  provision  of  water   and\r\n\r\nsanitation  and  the development of  facilities  in\r\n\r\nschool,  and  so  on.  Therefore,  those  corrupted\r\n\r\nconditions existed as if there was no Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is a Government of the people. We will\r\n\r\nput  emphasis on the livelihood and rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  work  and enjoy with the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  will do our work as responsible citizens.  This\r\n\r\nwork  should be done by all the people  who  should\r\n\r\nconscientiously work together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the other day, the eyes of the Member for Cairnhill were blurred. It was because\r\n\r\nformerly he was on this side of the House, and  now\r\n\r\nhe  is on that side. Tears came from his eyes,  and\r\n\r\nso  his  eyes  were  blurred. He thought  that  his\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Tanglin, said that in our\r\n\r\ncountry the deficit must be borne by all the people\r\n\r\nand  not by a minor section of the people. I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  the wrong view. We must know that today's\r\n\r\nGovernment  represents the poor people.  The  money\r\n\r\ngot  from the poor people must be used for the good\r\n\r\nof  the poor people. The wealthy are able to obtain\r\n\r\nthousands  of  dollars in salary but the  poor  can\r\n\r\nonly get a very small pay, and if the reduction  in\r\n\r\nallowances  is  to be borne by all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is most unfair. Furthermore, this  is\r\n\r\nonly a reduction in variable allowances. There  are\r\n\r\nmany low-paid Government employees who support  our\r\n\r\nmeasures. I met a low-paid Government employee  the\r\n\r\nother day who told me that what the Government  did\r\n\r\nwas quite right. He also said that in the past they\r\n\r\nhad to pay 70 cents for a kati of sugar, but now it\r\n\r\nis  only 20 cents a kati. A number of years ago, if\r\n\r\nanyone  wanted to buy a car, he had to  pay  coffee\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  now they can buy a car without  paying\r\n\r\ncoffee  money.  In the past if I wanted  to  buy  a\r\n\r\nshirt, I had to pay something like over $7 but  now\r\n\r\nI  only  pay about $3. That goes to show  that  the\r\n\r\nprices  of daily commodities have greatly  reduced.\r\n\r\nWe  are  only reducing the allowances of Government\r\n\r\nemployees  who are receiving high pay, and  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  this would not be a very great loss to  them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore  there  are  a  great  many  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  do not have to bear  a  higher  tax\r\n\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

That was when at one stage of\r\n\r\nhis peroration he took off his glasses to wipe them\r\n\r\nso  that  he could get a better view of Members  on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of the House. If I remember  correctly,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  was at that moment preparing to  fix  his\r\n\r\ngaze  on the Minister for Labour, and he might have\r\n\r\nsucceeded but for your timely intervention. I was a\r\n\r\nlittle  perturbed by this obviously  well-rehearsed\r\n\r\ngesture  because  the  one thing  you  cannot  help\r\n\r\nnoticing  in  this House, even without glasses,  is\r\n\r\nour  Minister for Labour and Law. In fact,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhad  to take a quick glance in the direction of our\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law to reassure myself that\r\n\r\nnothing  untoward had happened to him. But even  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill had some  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nrecognizing  the Minister for Labour  and  Law,  he\r\n\r\nmust  have been in pretty bad shape not to be  able\r\n\r\nto  see the Government benches. Sir, you have  only\r\n\r\nto look at the seating arrangements on this side of\r\n\r\nthe  House to become aware of this fact - the benches\r\n\r\nare  packed to full capacity. On the other side you\r\n\r\nsee  a  thin,  wavering line  of  Opposition  front\r\n\r\nbenchers  lost in a vast wilderness of  empty  back\r\n\r\nbenches - all  fronters  and  no  backers.  It   then\r\n\r\noccurred  to me that the trouble was not  with  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member's glasses as with his political vision.\r\n\r\nHis  political  vision  was not  particularly  keen\r\n\r\nbefore the elections, and it appears to have  faded\r\n\r\nmore than somewhat since then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, when listening to the speeches of\r\n\r\nthe hon.

With your permission,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think there are times when a very important\r\n\r\npolitical point might have to be got over in  terms\r\n\r\nof   parables  for  which  I  believe   there   are\r\n\r\nprecedents elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He  claimed  that there  was  no  essential\r\n\r\ndifference   between  the  P.A.P. programme - I   am\r\n\r\ngetting  to the point at issue - as embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and what the Labour\r\n\r\nFront - latterly    the    S.P.A.    /U.M.N.O./M.C.A.\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government - had been trying to do  during\r\n\r\nthe   last   four  years.  This  belief  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's objectives are essentially the same as\r\n\r\nthe Opposition's prompted the Member for Tanglin to\r\n\r\noutline  in  this  House the  role  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nintends  to  play.  The  Member  for  Tanglin,  who\r\n\r\nobviously has a nautical turn of mind, saw  himself\r\n\r\nand his colleagues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas ancient mariners helping the Government to guide\r\n\r\nthe ship of state. He compared, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nto the crew of a ship and the Prime Minister to its\r\n\r\ncaptain.  He  alarmed us, Sir, by saying  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition would keep a weather-eye open, and  warn\r\n\r\nthe  crew  and  the Captain whenever the  ship  was\r\n\r\nheading for the rocks. The assumption - a completely\r\n\r\nincorrect one, as I shall show later - is that we and\r\n\r\nthey  are heading for the same port. Now, Sir, even\r\n\r\nif  this  assumption is true, the last  thing  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends to do is to  take  advice  from\r\n\r\nshipwrecked captains. If the hon.

I have no doubt. Sir, that they genuinely\r\n\r\nbelieve that even if they have no ship or crew they\r\n\r\ncan  swim for it. Sir, the next journey - this  five-year journey - is through uncharted seas, and if  the\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite think they can swim for it,  then\r\n\r\nthey  must be rasher men than I thought they  were.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I submit, Sir, that there is a world  of\r\n\r\ndifference between what we stand for and  what  the\r\n\r\nhon. Members opposite stand for. Ours is a world of\r\n\r\nthe living. Theirs is a world of the dead. In fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  listening  to some of the speeches  from  the\r\n\r\nhon. Members was like listening to voices from  the\r\n\r\ngrave.  They  are  part and parcel  of  a  Colonial\r\n\r\nsociety  which  gave  birth to them  and  nourished\r\n\r\nthem.

I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  we  are  getting very  far  away  from  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was\r\n\r\ncontrasting   the   difference  between   the   new\r\n\r\npolitical force that we represent and the political\r\n\r\nforce the Members opposite represent, and the  only\r\n\r\nway I can indicate the difference is by contrasting\r\n\r\nthe  old  with the new, and if you will permit  me,\r\n\r\nSir, that will be quite evident when I contrast the\r\n\r\ntwo  generations of men and women who  are  in  the\r\n\r\nworld of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading, Sir, from left to right, there is the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin who began his political career- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I must ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  go off that tack because to me it seems that if\r\n\r\nhistories of individual members are given, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember will be speaking on something which is very,\r\n\r\nvery  far  away from the motion. He  can  speak  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  terms,  I  quite  agree,  contrasting  the\r\n\r\noutlook of one group of people with the outlook  of\r\n\r\nanother  group  of people, but I do  not  think  he\r\n\r\nshould embark on personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I shall talk\r\n\r\ncollectively  and  generally.  As  you  know,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncollectively, the representatives of the Party  now\r\n\r\ncalled  the  S.P.A., the majority of them,  started\r\n\r\nlife as political apprentices in a Party called the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party, a Party which is  now  defunct.\r\n\r\nOne  characteristic  of this  older  generation  of\r\n\r\npoliticians was their propensity to switch from one\r\n\r\npolitical Party to another political Party. Many of\r\n\r\nthem,  Sir,  have  two or three or  four  political\r\n\r\nparties   to   their   credit.   Another   feature,\r\n\r\ncollectively speaking, Sir, of the political record\r\n\r\nof   the  Opposition  is  that  they  profess   one\r\n\r\npolitical   doctrine  today,  just   the   contrary\r\n\r\npolitical  doctrine  the  next  day,  and   perhaps\r\n\r\nsomething  else the following day. Sir, if  someone\r\n\r\nwere writing a political history of this island, he\r\n\r\nwould  be amazed to discover the bleached bones  of\r\n\r\nso  many  political  Parties.  They  have  had  the\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party,  the  Democratic   Party,   the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist  Party,  the  Labour  Front,  the\r\n\r\nSocialist Party and now, Sir, the S.P.A.  Why  were\r\n\r\nthe  older generation of politicians, of  whom  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Members opposite are the lone survivors, able\r\n\r\nto switch from Party to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty,  to change political ideologies, to  profess\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  in  favour  of  the  defence   of\r\n\r\nColonialism;  that they were against  Socialism - and\r\n\r\nyet  these same people come back and say that  they\r\n\r\nare  now  in favour of anti-Colonialism,  and  that\r\n\r\nthey are now in favour of Socialism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this chopping and changing\r\n\r\nabout  from  one political party to another - what  I\r\n\r\nwould  call  political  polygamy - derive  from   any\r\n\r\npersonal  defects  in the people concerned.  It  is\r\n\r\nsimply  that  they  were  symptomatic  of  the  old\r\n\r\nColonial society which trusted men who could not be\r\n\r\nrelied   upon  to  owe  any  consistent   political\r\n\r\nallegiance, and it was people of that calibre  that\r\n\r\nthe  old  Colonial society welcomed, because  those\r\n\r\nwho  can chop and change their views are the people\r\n\r\nwhom you can manipulate and can use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt, Sir, that as individuals they\r\n\r\nwanted  to be single-minded, determined, and  loyal\r\n\r\nto  a  political cause. But they could not, because\r\n\r\nthey  were  serving a society which was already  in\r\n\r\nthe process of decay. So they wobbled and collapsed\r\n\r\nprimarily  because  they  did  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  the social forces which they  tried  to\r\n\r\nharness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, in 1954, the Progressive Party,\r\n\r\nwhich  was then in the ascendancy, thought that  it\r\n\r\ncould  outwit a rival political Party,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nParty,    through   the   device    of    automatic\r\n\r\nregistration. The theory was that by the device  of\r\n\r\nautomatic  registration they could bring  into  the\r\n\r\npolitical  arena,  people whom they  believed  were\r\n\r\nProgressives at heart and could therefore be relied\r\n\r\nupon  to  vote for the Progressive Party. But  what\r\n\r\nhappened  was that through the process of automatic\r\n\r\nregistration they brought in a large group  of  new\r\n\r\nvoters  who  turned out to be not  Progressives  at\r\n\r\nheart.  The people elected to vote for a new Party,\r\n\r\na  Socialist  Party - the  Labour  Front.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nrecently, Sir, the SPA, formerly the Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nthought  it  could also retrieve the  situation  by\r\n\r\nusing   another  device - the  device  of  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting - again on the assumption-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will\r\n\r\nremember  in this House, when I spoke on compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting,  1  said  that it would react  against  our\r\n\r\nGovernment, and it has so reacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, I am very glad to\r\n\r\nhear for the first time that the leader of the  SPA\r\n\r\ndeliberately  embarked on a venture which  he  knew\r\n\r\nwould   eventually  react  against  him.   But   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the situation  is  different.  I\r\n\r\nworked  on  a  newspaper which wrote  an  editorial\r\n\r\nwarning  the then Government that they  were  being\r\n\r\nvery   foolish  to  embark  on  compulsory  voting,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  consequences might be otherwise  than\r\n\r\nwhat  was generally hoped for by S.P.A. But anyway,\r\n\r\nSir,  through  the device of compulsory  voting,  a\r\n\r\nlarger  group  of electorate - the electorate  jumped\r\n\r\nfrom  300,000  to  600,000 - was  brought  into   the\r\n\r\npolitical arena, resulting eventually in the  death\r\n\r\nof  yet another political Party. And the reason for\r\n\r\nthis  is  that both the Progressives  and  the  SPA\r\n\r\nfailed  to realise, and still do not realise,  that\r\n\r\nthe  vast  majority of people since they belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  under-privileged class are ready for a  social\r\n\r\nrevolution. And the larger the electorate  becomes,\r\n\r\nthe  greater  the preference for political  Parties\r\n\r\nwhich    are    equipped,   organisationally    and\r\n\r\nideologically, for a social revolution. The PAP was\r\n\r\nsuch a Party. The people recognised it as such  and\r\n\r\nthey voted for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the PAP believe, Sir, that a social\r\n\r\nrevolution is inevitable. It is inevitable  because\r\n\r\npeople  no  longer believe that poverty,  injustice\r\n\r\nand   humiliation  are  conditions  to  be  endured\r\n\r\npatiently.  They  are  not  visitations  sent  from\r\n\r\nheaven.   Social  revolution  is  inevitable.   The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  whether  it  will  be  brought   about\r\n\r\npeacefully or through revolutionary violence.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  choice  presented to people  everywhere - in\r\n\r\nthis country and in many countries in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the PAP are dedicated to bringing this\r\n\r\nsocial   revolution  to  birth   through   peaceful\r\n\r\ndemocratic means. Sir, those who have read the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara's  speech  with  a  little  more\r\n\r\nperception  would have understood that the  purpose\r\n\r\nand  aim of the programme outlined in the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech is  to  bring  about  the\r\n\r\nsocial   revolution  through  peaceful   democratic\r\n\r\nmeans.  Our  programme is not as the  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nopposite suggested - a rehash of the Labour Front and\r\n\r\nSPA  programmes. It may be, Sir, that the SPA,  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front   and  even  the  Liberal-Socialists\r\n\r\nproclaimed  socialist ideals; they  too  proclaimed\r\n\r\ntheir  determination to seek justice for the common\r\n\r\nman.  But where we and they differ, and the  voters\r\n\r\nsaw  the  difference,  is that  we  are  in  deadly\r\n\r\nearnest  about implementing our proclaimed  policy.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the difference, Sir. In their  manifestos\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Members opposite were sometimes even more\r\n\r\nrevolutionary during the election campaign than  we\r\n\r\nwere.  In fact, if I recollect correctly, Sir,  our\r\n\r\nprogramme was more realistic because we went to the\r\n\r\nelection not promising Utopias and heaven on earth.\r\n\r\nWe  said,  \"If you vote for the P.A.P., the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will demand sacrifices on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe   people.\"  In  fact,  I  remember  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry going around the\r\n\r\ncountry  with  a very tattered copy of  the  Petir,\r\n\r\nwherein  we did write a series of articles  saying,\r\n\r\n\"If  the P.A.P. were elected to power, we would not\r\n\r\ngive  you  a heaven on earth.\" We said we  demanded\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and work on the part of the people.  We\r\n\r\nsaid   that  during  the  election.  Hon.   Members\r\n\r\nopposite  used  that issue of the Petir  number  to\r\n\r\nshow that the P.A.P. Government offers you far less\r\n\r\nthan  what we are able to promise you. And yet  the\r\n\r\npeople voted for us, Sir, because they knew in fact\r\n\r\nthat,  unlike  Members opposite, we are  in  deadly\r\n\r\nearnest  in whatever promises we made. And that  is\r\n\r\nwhy, Sir, they voted for us, for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, we have never, either before,\r\n\r\nduring or since the election, ever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromised  Utopia. All that we intend to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nshow our people that a socialist democracy can make\r\n\r\nthings better for the people, can improve their lot\r\n\r\nthough  not  in terms visualised by the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin. He complained of a P.A.P. dictatorship - how\r\n\r\nterrible  we  were  because our  recent  action  in\r\n\r\nintroducing  wage  cuts  had  brought  considerable\r\n\r\nsuffering and hardship; because those who  rode  in\r\n\r\ntaxis were now reduced to riding in buses. But what\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Tanglin and those  who  think\r\n\r\nlike  him  do not realise is that the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  the  people in this country have travelled  and\r\n\r\nwill  travel  by  buses.  But  as  far  as  he   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, \"the people\" means two kinds of  people,\r\n\r\nSir.  Those whom God has elected should  travel  by\r\n\r\ntaxis and those whom God has condemned to travel by\r\n\r\nbuses.  An  injustice begins when people  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen ordained by God to travel by taxis are reduced\r\n\r\nto  travelling by buses. That is injustice. But  if\r\n\r\npeople  who have been ordained by God to travel  by\r\n\r\nbus  continue  to travel by bus,  that  is  in  the\r\n\r\nnatural  order  of  things.  It  is  that  kind  of\r\n\r\noutlook,  Sir, which ended in disaster for  Members\r\n\r\nwho now currently support the S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our goal is to strive for a socialist\r\n\r\ndemocracy  which  does  not  promise  paradise  but\r\n\r\ninvites and demands certain sacrifices. But let  us\r\n\r\nmake  one thing clear. Though in trying to  achieve\r\n\r\nand  establish a social revolution we shall  demand\r\n\r\nsacrifices  from the people, especially from  those\r\n\r\nwho are in a privileged position in society, let me\r\n\r\ntell  them  that in the long run the sacrifices  we\r\n\r\ndemand  will  be  cheaper than a social  revolution\r\n\r\nbrought  about by revolutionary violence. There  is\r\n\r\nno  choice.  If  you  are embarked  upon  a  social\r\n\r\nrevolution,  then to bring it about  peacefully  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  the  necessary sacrifices;  or  we  can\r\n\r\npostpone  it because we are too afraid to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  very small sacrifices demanded. But eventually\r\n\r\nthe  sacrifices  will be imposed on people  whether\r\n\r\nthey  like  it or not - and perhaps at a far  greater\r\n\r\ncost than what is demanded of them today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the background against which the\r\n\r\nspeech  by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should  be\r\n\r\nviewed   because  then  you  will  see  in   proper\r\n\r\nperspective the policy outlined in that speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like to deal with a particular\r\n\r\naspect of our social revolution - the creation  of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan nation. One of the major tasks of the newly-created Ministry of Culture will be as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech put it, \"to instil  in  our\r\n\r\npeople  of  all races the will to be a nation.\"  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection, Sir, I would like  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsome   of   the  observations  made  by  the   UMNO\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, and in particular the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, Sir, his speech and that of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kembangan were the most disturbing and\r\n\r\nthe most dismal I have heard during this session of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly. I say \"disturbing and dismal\" because\r\n\r\nthey  spoke  as leaders of a Malay political  Party\r\n\r\nwhose counterpart happens to be the ruling Party in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The UMNO representatives  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  not  only  professed scepticism  that  we\r\n\r\nwould ever be able to create a Malayan nation,  but\r\n\r\nthey  were  also of the view that  it  was  not  an\r\n\r\nenterprise they would approve of. In fact, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai advocated what was in fact\r\n\r\na  new  theory - the  theory of  three  nations.  The\r\n\r\nMalays, he said, should remain Malays; the Chinese,\r\n\r\nChinese;  the  Indians, Indians. This  three-nation\r\n\r\ntheory  seems to be a recent development,  for  the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai appears not to have  given\r\n\r\nvoice to it before in such strong terms when he was\r\n\r\na   Member   of  the  Labour  Front - U.M.N.O. - M.C.A. - \r\n\r\nCoalition Government. Since his departure from this\r\n\r\nside of the House to the other, this new theory  of\r\n\r\na   Singapore  of  three  nations  has  been  born.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  Sir, the most unusual feature about  this\r\n\r\nthree-nation theory is that it does not quite  fall\r\n\r\nin  line  with  the Federation U.M.N.O.'s  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the question of a Malayan nation. Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation, the creation of a Malayan nation is\r\n\r\nnot  only accepted as a desirable objective  to  be\r\n\r\nstriven  for  but  also  as a  practical  one.  The\r\n\r\nFederation's leaders,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  Tunku Abdul Rahman downwards, have repeatedly\r\n\r\nstressed  that  the future of the  country  depends\r\n\r\nupon  the  three races being welded into a  Malayan\r\n\r\nnation. In fact, this objective is the corner-stone\r\n\r\nof the Alliance policy in the Federation. The Tunku\r\n\r\nin  particular has never hesitated to lash  out  at\r\n\r\npolitical parties which thrive by preaching  racial\r\n\r\nexclusiveness.  In  fact,  Sir,  last  Sunday,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Prime Minister of the Federation  came  out\r\n\r\nwith a slashing attack on political parties in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  which  have overtly exploited  communal\r\n\r\nsentiments and appealed to racial prejudices.  Yet,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  representatives of Singapore's  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nare  publicly repudiating the concept and aim of  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation.  Why, Sir, if it is  possible  and\r\n\r\ndesirable to weld the three races in the Federation\r\n\r\ninto  a  Malayan  nation,  should  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang   Serai  and  his  colleagues  advocate   a\r\n\r\ncontrary  course  for Singapore? Anyway,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai must know the consequences\r\n\r\nof  a  theory  which insists on keeping  the  three\r\n\r\nraces distinct and separate. First, such a division\r\n\r\nmust  keep  alive the flames of communal prejudices\r\n\r\nand  fears, both of which can be readily  exploited\r\n\r\nby   communal  leaders  who  have  no  constructive\r\n\r\npolicies  to  offer  the  people.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  may  not  have  followed   to   its\r\n\r\ninevitable and tragic conclusion the logic  implied\r\n\r\nin  his  three-nation theory. He may not have  gone\r\n\r\nfar in his thinking - yet. Since he is not here, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  shall lead his colleagues to this inevitable and\r\n\r\ntragic  conclusion if only to make  them  aware  of\r\n\r\nwhat this sort of thinking can ultimately mean  for\r\n\r\nthem,  for us and for the 1\u00bd million people whose\r\n\r\nlives  and happiness we hold in our hands. For  one\r\n\r\nthing,   Sir,   the  three-nation  theory   implies\r\n\r\nresistance  to  Malayan nationalism simply  because\r\n\r\nMalayan nationalism is a complete negation  of  the\r\n\r\nthree-nation  theory.  If, as  is  inevitable,  the\r\n\r\nforces  of Malayan nationalism grow stronger,  then\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Geylang Serai and those  who  think\r\n\r\nlike  him must actively resist Malayan nationalism.\r\n\r\nAnd  how  is  Malayan nationalism to  be  resisted?\r\n\r\nThere is only one way of doing this and that is  by\r\n\r\nfanning the latent flames of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunalism.  Put  more bluntly, racial  solidarity\r\n\r\ncan  and must be strengthened only by appealing  to\r\n\r\nracial  fears and racial sentiments.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nlogic of any movement where the binding link  is  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  racial identity. The only way  a  racial\r\n\r\ngroup can retain its identity is by appealing to it\r\n\r\nin terms which it understands - and racial groups can\r\n\r\nunderstand and appreciate only those concepts which\r\n\r\nare  spelt out in racial terms. Conversely it  also\r\n\r\npresupposes accusations of racial treachery against\r\n\r\nMalays, and for that matter Chinese or Indians  who\r\n\r\nally  themselves with non-communal parties striving\r\n\r\nin  the  direction  of a Malayan  nationalism.  For\r\n\r\nevery  Malay - and  Chinese or Indian - who  repudiates\r\n\r\nthe  idea of racial exclusiveness, becomes a direct\r\n\r\nand permanent threat to the proponents of the three-nation theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Member for Geylang Serai will re-examine some of his speeches made during the recent\r\n\r\nelection, he will discover how necessary it  is  to\r\n\r\nexploit  openly communal and racial  sentiments  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  racial solidarity. It may be  something\r\n\r\nwhich  he  may not want to do but which  is  forced\r\n\r\nupon him by the force of circumstances. For that is\r\n\r\nthe  only  way you can hold racial groups together.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is inevitable that as the forces of Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism gather strength, they must be countered\r\n\r\nby  fanning  the  fires  of communalism,  and  this\r\n\r\nprocess  must eventually end either in the  triumph\r\n\r\nof  Malayan nationalism or in communal discord.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be, Sir, that the Member for Geylang Serai and\r\n\r\nhis associates may think that it is possible for  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  leader  to switch off  communal  passions\r\n\r\nonce  they  threaten to get out of  hand.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nIndia  and Ceylon, there were communal leaders  who\r\n\r\nthought  they  could switch off  communal  passions\r\n\r\nwhich  they  had  perhaps  unwittingly  helped   to\r\n\r\ncreate. They could not, as hundreds of thousands of\r\n\r\npeople discovered to their horror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put the matter a little more plainly. We\r\n\r\nin  Malaya and in Singapore have reached a stage in\r\n\r\nour  political development where we have the choice\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  roads: the road to Malayan nationalism or  the\r\n\r\nroad to communal dissension - or worse, Sir, there is\r\n\r\nno  third road. We move in the direction of one  or\r\n\r\nthe  other. Sir, the Member for Geylang  Serai  and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues may be of the view  that  only  the\r\n\r\nFederation  should  follow  the  road  to   Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism while Singapore should take the  tragic\r\n\r\nroad  to  communalism implicit in the  three-nation\r\n\r\ntheory propagated in this House during the last few\r\n\r\ndays.  But if Singapore keeps to the communal path,\r\n\r\nit  can  only result in this predominantly  Chinese\r\n\r\ncity becoming a bastion of Chinese communalism.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the three-nation theory propounded  by\r\n\r\nsome of the U.M.N.O. representatives is not even an\r\n\r\ninvitation but an insistence that this State, which\r\n\r\nis  dominated by the Chinese, should convert itself\r\n\r\ninto  a bastion of Chinese communalism - because,  if\r\n\r\nwe  deny them the opportunity of becoming a part of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan nation, then we are saying they should\r\n\r\nremain  a bastion of Chinese communalism. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow,  Sir,  whether they realise the  consequences\r\n\r\nwhich follow from the three-nation theory that  was\r\n\r\npropounded   by   them.  This  is  the   inevitable\r\n\r\nconsequence, if Singapore should become  a  bastion\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  communalism, then I say the  prospects\r\n\r\nfor  Malayan nationalism will be equally dim in the\r\n\r\nFederation,  because  Singapore  as  a  bastion  of\r\n\r\nChinese  communalism will act as  a  stimulant  for\r\n\r\nChinese  communalism  in the  Federation.  To  this\r\n\r\nextent, Sir, the three-nation theory, confined only\r\n\r\nto Singapore, will frustrate and destroy one of the\r\n\r\nmajor  aims  of  the  Alliance Government,  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation's U.M.N.O. and of the Tunku to create  a\r\n\r\nMalayan nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai asked us what we\r\n\r\nmeant  by \"Malayan\", and whether we hoped to create\r\n\r\na Malayan nation. They are rhetorical questions but\r\n\r\nit  was  quite clear from his general tone that  he\r\n\r\nwas  quite  sceptical about this. He presumed  that\r\n\r\nthere can be no such thing as a Malayan and that we\r\n\r\ncertainly cannot hope to create a Malayan nation in\r\n\r\nSingapore. But I will answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  second part of his question. Yes, Sir, we hope\r\n\r\nto  create a Malayan nation because the alternative\r\n\r\nis  too terrible for us to contemplate. That is why\r\n\r\nthis Government has set up the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\nWe  believe that the prelude to a Malayan nation is\r\n\r\nMalayan  consciousness, and a Malayan consciousness\r\n\r\ncan be brought about by implanting in the minds  of\r\n\r\npeople ideas and sentiments which provide them with\r\n\r\na  sense of common identity, common purpose, common\r\n\r\neffort, and common destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is not as impossible a task as the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. representatives  sitting  opposite   may\r\n\r\nthink. It is being done every day in every country.\r\n\r\nFor   example,  people  are  not  born   Americans,\r\n\r\nFrenchmen   or  Japanese.  They  are  turned   into\r\n\r\nAmericans, Frenchmen or Japanese. A man becomes  an\r\n\r\nAmerican, or Frenchman, or Japanese because of  the\r\n\r\nmental  conditioning he is subjected to;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, national consciousness is largely a question\r\n\r\nof  education and upbringing. A child born  is  not\r\n\r\nborn  a  Frenchman, or a German, or a  Malayan,  or\r\n\r\neven  a Malay or a Chinese. It is through the  long\r\n\r\nprocess of mental conditioning that he turns out to\r\n\r\nbe  a  Malay,  Chinese or Indian. In fact,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nChinese brought up in the cultural traditions of  a\r\n\r\nMalay  imbibing the Malay language, Malay religion,\r\n\r\nMalay  customs  and  traditions,  becomes  for  all\r\n\r\npractical  purposes  a Malay.  Similarly,  you  can\r\n\r\nbring  up an Indian or a Chinese as an American  or\r\n\r\nany other nationality that you want. It is not race\r\n\r\nbut  the  cultural conditioning to which a  man  is\r\n\r\nsubjected  that makes him whatever  he  is.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  not that difficult to create  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  This is happening  every  day.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  I  invite Members on the other  side  of\r\n\r\nthis House to look at Members who are in our Party.\r\n\r\nI, Sir, am a Ceylonese - a minority of minorities  - one of those covered by the Constitution. Yet I  am\r\n\r\nnot  afraid. I have never felt any particular  fear\r\n\r\nthat  as  a  minority  of  minorities  I  might  be\r\n\r\ntrampled upon by my colleagues on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  or  by  the  Party  to  which  I  subscribe.\r\n\r\nBecause,  Sir, in my Party, though we have  Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese and Indians,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  talk or think as Malays,  Chinese,  or\r\n\r\nIndians.  We think as Malayans. And one  becomes  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  when one ceases to evaluate the character,\r\n\r\ngoodness,  and intelligence of a man by the  colour\r\n\r\nof  his  skin,  by the shape of his  nose,  or  the\r\n\r\ntexture of his hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying that the effort to create a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation  is  an easy one.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nobstacles,  but  I say the major  obstacle  to  the\r\n\r\ncreation   of  a  Malayan  nation  is  communalism.\r\n\r\nCommunalism, Sir, does not spring out  of  nowhere.\r\n\r\nPeople  are not born communalists. They are  turned\r\n\r\ninto  communalists. The flames, of communalism  are\r\n\r\nfanned  by  a  minority of leaders who discover  in\r\n\r\ncommunalism  a  short-cut to political  popularity,\r\n\r\nand in every case, Sir, it has often turned out  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  short-cut to tragedy when, not the  communal\r\n\r\nleaders,  but  thousands of  innocent  and  deluded\r\n\r\npeople  have had to pay the price-and a very  heavy\r\n\r\nprice  sometimes. Therefore, Sir, we fully realise,\r\n\r\nas  the  Alliance Government in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya fully realises, that the task of creating  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation  will be a long and difficult  one.\r\n\r\nThe  further we move in the direction of a  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism,  the  fiercer will be  the  resistance\r\n\r\noffered  by  those  who have  vested  interests  in\r\n\r\ncommunal  politics, whether they be Malay, Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndian, or even English educated. We realise,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat communal sentiments are the easiest things  to\r\n\r\nexploit in times of political stresses and strains.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the recent elections, the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\ntried to whip up Chinese communalism because of our\r\n\r\nstand  on  the  question of Malay as  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.  The S.P.A. issued a pamphlet  which  was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be a guide to their speakers.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe  points stressed in the pamphlet was that  when\r\n\r\nspeaking  to  a Chinese audience, they  should  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. was endangering Chinese  culture\r\n\r\nbecause  by  standing  for Malay  as  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage, We were going to destroy Chinese culture.\r\n\r\nThere was talk of ramming Malay down the throats of\r\n\r\nnon-Malay children. That was an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen appeal to communalism, and the exploitation of\r\n\r\ncommunalism  need  not  necessarily  come  from   a\r\n\r\ncommunal party. And yet, Sir, the interesting thing\r\n\r\nis  that  there  was  not a word  of  protest  from\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. leaders against this attempt by the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nto  work up Chinese communal feelings on the  issue\r\n\r\nof  a  national language. Just one little  item  of\r\n\r\nfood  for  thought  for the hon. Members  opposite.\r\n\r\nThey should reflect on how, in these elections, the\r\n\r\npeople  reacted  to communal propaganda - whether  it\r\n\r\ncame from a communal party or not. This, Sir, is  a\r\n\r\npredominantly Chinese city and yet the people voted\r\n\r\nfor  a  Party which espoused Malay as the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage. I do not think we have quite realised the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of this. We went before  the  people,\r\n\r\nlargely  Chinese, who quite rightly  are  proud  of\r\n\r\ntheir culture, a very ancient and rich culture, and\r\n\r\nsaid, \"We of the P.A.P. will fight this election on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of Malay as the national language\".  And\r\n\r\nthey voted for us. This, Sir, is political maturity\r\n\r\nand  responsibility  of  a  very  high  order,   It\r\n\r\nrevealed  that  the  ordinary  people  can  show  a\r\n\r\ngreater   sense  of  responsibility  and  political\r\n\r\nwisdom than can some of the so-called leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the underlying assumption\r\n\r\nbehind Malayan nationalism and a Malayan outlook is\r\n\r\nnot  very  difficult to grasp. It is  simply  this:\r\n\r\nthat  the  shape of a man's nose, the  cut  of  his\r\n\r\neyes,  the  colour or the texture of his hair,  are\r\n\r\nnot a sound basis on which to build a political  or\r\n\r\nan  economic philosophy. Neither can political  and\r\n\r\neconomic   problems  be  solved  by  reference   to\r\n\r\nsomething which we just got through the accident of\r\n\r\nbirth - our  skin, our colour, and the shape  of  our\r\n\r\neyes.  Therefore,  Sir,  a  Malayan  outlook   then\r\n\r\ninitially  means acceptance of the  truth  that  in\r\n\r\npolitics  and  economics, racial considerations  do\r\n\r\nnot enter. More positively, it means acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that whether we are Malays, Chinese,  or\r\n\r\nIndians, we are committed to living in this country\r\n\r\nfor all time. If we are not to live permanently  as\r\n\r\nstrangers  and  rivals, then  we  must  accept  the\r\n\r\nidea - there is no other choice - that we must live as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers of a nation, a Malayan nation. That is what\r\n\r\nwe  mean by creating a Malay an outlook. It is  the\r\n\r\nonly  outlook worth fighting for, because even  the\r\n\r\nterm  of life of political parties is more or  less\r\n\r\nforeordained.  They  will run  out  their  allotted\r\n\r\ntime.  But people, the Malays, Chinese and Indians,\r\n\r\nwill live here for hundreds of years. And we of the\r\n\r\npresent  generation can at least  help  them  solve\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  problem, by  removing  from  their\r\n\r\nminds  what is really a superstition - that race  and\r\n\r\nreligion  are factors which should enter  into  our\r\n\r\npolitical calculations. And not only that, but that\r\n\r\nthey  should  also become the basis  for  political\r\n\r\nconflict.  If  we  can during our  term  of  office\r\n\r\nexercise  this superstition then perhaps,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nwould have done a great deal for the future of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  new trade union policy outlined  in  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech is not a  surprise\r\n\r\nto  the  trade  union movement in this  country.  I\r\n\r\nmyself  being so closely associated with the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  try to bring to  this  House  some\r\n\r\nimportant things when we are discussing the  future\r\n\r\nof the trade union movement in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the war, in 1947/48, trade unions were\r\n\r\nso  powerful in Singapore and so militant that they\r\n\r\nwere  in the foreground to fight for the legitimate\r\n\r\nright  of  workers  in  Singapore.  But  under  the\r\n\r\npretext  of Communist subversion, the past colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced  the  Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nwhich considerably affected the growth of the trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  in  this country.  When  this  was\r\n\r\nimplemented, most of the unions became weak and its\r\n\r\nleaders  had  to find a different line.  Since  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the Emergency Regulations  up  to\r\n\r\n1955,  most of the unions merely existed for name's\r\n\r\nsake.  Then in 1955 there were the elections  under\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel Constitution, and about one year  after\r\n\r\nthe  elections, the unions became powerful and they\r\n\r\nagain  fought to see that justice was done  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  But when we discussed from 1955  onwards,\r\n\r\neven though we had a party government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  began  to  change from the party name  into  an\r\n\r\nindividual  name, and now it is commonly  known  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore and to trade union circles\r\n\r\nas  the Labour Front Coalition Government, or as it\r\n\r\nis  generally  known, the Lim Yew Hock  Government.\r\n\r\nEven though it is known by name as the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, we trade unionists  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   public  called  it  the  Lim   Yew   Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And  all that the Government  did  was\r\n\r\nthis.  The  Government tried to  divide  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1956, almost all workers and trade\r\n\r\nunionists  were  watching the situation,  and  they\r\n\r\nwere  paving  the  way to see the  funeral  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  Government  had  openly  declared\r\n\r\ntheir  policy that they were the Labour Front,  and\r\n\r\nthey would do whatever they could to help the trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement in this country. But when they  sat\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry they forgot what they had promised\r\n\r\nto  the  people. They forgot what they promised  to\r\n\r\nthe workers, and they adopted an entirely different\r\n\r\nattitude  which we think is worse than the attitude\r\n\r\nof the past Colonial Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from 1956 onwards, we, the trade unionists,\r\n\r\nwere watching and paving the way, in a peaceful and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  way, to see the funeral of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  or S.P.A. Coalition Government. Finally,  on\r\n\r\n30th  May, we succeeded, and we all saw the funeral\r\n\r\nof  the  past  Government. But  luckily,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chief Minister and Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare  is  in the Opposition today,  so  that  at\r\n\r\nleast we have the chance to hear what he had to say\r\n\r\nabout what he had done for the trade union movement\r\n\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Cairnhill last Friday\r\n\r\nmentioned that the past Government had done so many\r\n\r\ngood  things. One important thing he mentioned  was\r\n\r\nthat  while he was Chief Minister and Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare he tried  his  level  best  to\r\n\r\nsettle  disputes, and finally settled  so  many  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the important things in the new\r\n\r\npolicy is that the new Government is going to  have\r\n\r\nan Industrial Court of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour. For that the workers will be happy. Genuine\r\n\r\ncases will be heard in this Court of Labour and the\r\n\r\nawards  of  that  Court  will  be  implemented   by\r\n\r\nstatute. What happened to the last Government? Even\r\n\r\ntoday,  the trade union movements, when looking  at\r\n\r\nthese courts of labour and arbitration courts,  are\r\n\r\nsuspicious because the past Government, even though\r\n\r\nthey had the Labour Court, the Industrial Court and\r\n\r\ncourts of inquiry, did nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on Friday, the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  mentioned that he settled the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board Union's dispute. Sir, in  1957,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board Staff Association started a\r\n\r\ngo-slow  campaign for recognition of  their  union.\r\n\r\nFinally  the  matter was brought  before  the  past\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The  Assembly appointed a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  to  make a recommendation and  to  lay  it\r\n\r\nbefore  the Assembly. The Commission did,  and  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  was put before  the  Assembly.  But\r\n\r\nwhat happened to the recommendation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Commission ordered by the whole\r\n\r\nAssembly, and the recommendation was put before the\r\n\r\nsame Assembly. At that time, the Opposition Member,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar, moved a motion asking\r\n\r\nthe  House to urge the Singapore Harbour  Board  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the Commission's findings. On the  first\r\n\r\nday,  the whole of the Assembly, if I am right,  22\r\n\r\nMembers,  unanimously  agreed  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour  Board  should implement  the  Commission's\r\n\r\nfindings.  It was passed in the Assembly.  But  one\r\n\r\nweek, two weeks and three weeks passed, and nothing\r\n\r\nhappened.  The former Chief Minister  and  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  and Welfare had no guts  to  face  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour  Board and tell  them  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly had passed a  motion\r\n\r\nunanimously urging the Singapore Harbour  Board  to\r\n\r\nimplement the findings of the Commission.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Harbour Board is a statutory  body,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  failed to  make  them  accept  the\r\n\r\nfindings  of the Commission, and if the  Government\r\n\r\nfailed  to  enforce the findings  on  a  Government\r\n\r\nemployer,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  could the Government force a private  employer\r\n\r\nin  Singapore to follow the recommendations  of  an\r\n\r\narbitration court or a court of inquiry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, after three weeks the subject was\r\n\r\nbrought before the same Assembly, and at that  time\r\n\r\nwe all knew that the Labour Front was going to sink\r\n\r\nand  the  Party leaders and the present Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  were running mad to form  a  new  Party.\r\n\r\nThey  tried  to go to the Opposition  side  to  get\r\n\r\nMembers and all kinds of political manoeuvring were\r\n\r\ngoing  on.  So, when again the matter  was  brought\r\n\r\nbefore  the Assembly, what we heard from the former\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  and the Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare  was  that  he was not  going  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Harbour Board to enforce  the  findings.\r\n\r\nThe reason he gave was personal prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, he said in the Assembly that with the\r\n\r\npresent  law, seven members can form a trade  union\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. In other words, our past  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister for Labour and Welfare were  not\r\n\r\ninterested in seeing a united trade union  movement\r\n\r\nin  this  country and they were not  interested  in\r\n\r\nseeing that the trade unions and their workers  are\r\n\r\nhappy. But what they are interested in is their own\r\n\r\nselfish  interest, and to see that their  blue-eyed\r\n\r\nboys are happy, wherever they have got them, and to\r\n\r\ngive  them more encouragement to do corruption  and\r\n\r\nto break the trade union movement in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood the hon. Member. But has  he  alleged\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Cairnhill encourages corruption\r\n\r\nin  the trade union movement? If he has, of course,\r\n\r\nthat  is  completely unparliamentary. I might  have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  him. Perhaps the hon.

Member should be  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit more careful about his imputations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, when one talks about\r\n\r\npolitical  or trade union corruption, it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that they are going to receive money straight\r\n\r\nfrom  the workers and put it in their pockets  What\r\n\r\nthe  trade union movement is interested in  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Government towards the unions,  and\r\n\r\nin that sense we, the trade unionists, believe that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is corrupted because they  are  not\r\n\r\ninterested in seeing to the welfare of the workers.\r\n\r\nBut we do not really mean that they receive $10  or\r\n\r\n$5  from  workers so that they can join a union  or\r\n\r\nform a union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

Member not to  use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"corrupt\" because The word \"corrupt\" in  that\r\n\r\nsense means corrupt in the dictionary sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Sir, one important thing is that,\r\n\r\neven   today  there  are  people  who  are  closely\r\n\r\nassociated with the Labour Ministry who are not  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  not  surprising.   After   the\r\n\r\nelections they scooted off to Hongkong or  to  some\r\n\r\nother  place. If they are so fond of  us,  why  did\r\n\r\nthey  want to run away from this country. Sir?  Did\r\n\r\nthey  find jobs for the trade union movement?  They\r\n\r\nmanaged their affairs in the Labour Ministry in  an\r\n\r\ninefficient way. They also contested the elections,\r\n\r\nbut  in the elections it is quite natural that  one\r\n\r\nwill  have  to win. When they cannot get  into  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  they scooted off the next day by  plane,\r\n\r\nand they are no more in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this machinery which is meant to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interest of the working class, to safeguard the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  trade  union  movement  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry was abused either by the past Government or\r\n\r\nthrough the inefficiency of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned to use that  machinery.  That\r\n\r\nwas  where  the past Government collapsed,  because\r\n\r\neven  on Friday last the Member for Cairnhill  said\r\n\r\nthat  he passed the Shop Assistants Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\nClerks   Employment  Ordinance  and   every   other\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say you have passed an Ordinance but you\r\n\r\nkeep  it  in the files of the, Ministry of  Labour,\r\n\r\nwhat benefit will the worker get? There are so many\r\n\r\nOrdinances  which they passed and which  are  still\r\n\r\nkept  in  the old files of the Ministry of  Labour,\r\n\r\nand nobody knows where they kept them now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government pass an Ordinance, it is the\r\n\r\nduty   of  the  Government  to  see  that   it   is\r\n\r\nimplemented without fear or favour. Once  they  are\r\n\r\nable  to  do  that, then only will the workers  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a real Government who looks after  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people. But the past  Government,\r\n\r\nsaid  the hon. Member for Cairnhill, had, to  their\r\n\r\ncredit, passed the Clerks Employment Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nShop   Assistants  Ordinance  and   the   Factories\r\n\r\nOrdinance and so many other Ordinances. But we  who\r\n\r\nhave moved so closely with the trade union movement\r\n\r\nknow   that  although  all  these  Ordinances  were\r\n\r\npassed,  they  were kept in the files,  and  nobody\r\n\r\nwent to see whether the employers are following the\r\n\r\nOrdinances  or not. There are certain  cases  where\r\n\r\nthere  is nobody to prosecute or take the necessary\r\n\r\naction  against  the employers who did  not  follow\r\n\r\nthese Ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing in the policy speech is the\r\n\r\nTrade Union House. It has long been the ambition of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Trades  Union  Congress  and  other\r\n\r\nunions  to see a central organisation for  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers, and, of course, the Singapore Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress  before spent a considerable time  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a united trade union movement\r\n\r\nand a central place for all the unions to assemble.\r\n\r\nBut   the  encouragement  we  got  from  the   past\r\n\r\nGovernment  was quite pitiful. Also  the  fantastic\r\n\r\nnumber  of splinter and yellow unions formed during\r\n\r\nthe  past  four  years in Singapore prevented  this\r\n\r\nambition of the unions. All the unions in Singapore\r\n\r\nshould   be   united   under  a   single   national\r\n\r\norganisation. And this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational  organisation must have  a  proper  place,\r\n\r\nthat  is, a trade union house. The policy  of  this\r\n\r\nnew  Government is wholeheartedly welcomed  by  all\r\n\r\nreal  trade  unions in Singapore  because  we,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, were fighting against two  kinds  of\r\n\r\nexploitation.  One  is that  we  are  fighting  our\r\n\r\nforeign  masters, and the second  is  that  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  colonial masters' exploitation  of  workers.\r\n\r\nBut since the new Constitution came into force, we,\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement, must have  a  different\r\n\r\noutlook, that is, a national outlook and a sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility. The present Government is  here  to\r\n\r\nsee that a real trade union movement is encouraged,\r\n\r\nand  a  proper  place should be given  to  them  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And,  of  course,  the  present  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has a foundation laid by the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement in this country, and the P.A.P. knows what\r\n\r\nto  do  and  what  is  good  for  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement. We are here to see that justice and  fair\r\n\r\nplay   should  be  done  towards  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trade union office will also play an\r\n\r\nimportant  part to produce the fruits of  the  good\r\n\r\nwork  this Government is going to do. If we want  a\r\n\r\nreally  contented  trade  union  movement  for  all\r\n\r\nworkers,  we  must also have a policy of  educating\r\n\r\nthese   workers   and  the  trade   union   leaders\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is also the duty of the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement to have full trust and confidence in  this\r\n\r\nnew  setup,  that  is  the  Court  of  Labour,  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, the Conciliation Board, and also\r\n\r\na  new  Trade  Union House, to encourage  the  real\r\n\r\ngrowth of the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should again say that what the past Government\r\n\r\ndid  towards the trade union movement can never  be\r\n\r\nforgotten. The subject of splinter unions will come\r\n\r\nup for debate again at the next sitting and we will\r\n\r\nhave  a  more interesting time with the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill sitting at the opposite side, because\r\n\r\nup  to 30th May, the last day, he was sitting  here\r\n\r\nand  he was mainly responsible for the splinter  or\r\n\r\nyellow  unions in Singapore. But we will be  giving\r\n\r\nthem a good time,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  on  the  13th of August on the  splinter  and\r\n\r\nyellow  unions.

Member for Cairnhill  while\r\n\r\nwe are talking about economic policy. He said there\r\n\r\nis  a good atmosphere for industrial development in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. But he forgot to mention also  one\r\n\r\npoint  as well, i.e. there is good opportunity  for\r\n\r\npolitical crooks to run away to the Federation  and\r\n\r\nstart tin mines. So it is not only for business but\r\n\r\nalso for political crooks just to scoot off to  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  go to Ipoh, and start tin mines.  They\r\n\r\nhave got good opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, regarding this new Ordinance\r\n\r\nrelating  to the trade union movement,  we  on  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  side will consider it as the Magna  Carta\r\n\r\nof  the trade union movement and for the workers in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The only Party or Government  which  can\r\n\r\nfaithfully  carry out this policy  is  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment - the P.A.P. Government - because the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  got  the backing and confidence of  the  whole\r\n\r\ntrade union movement in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of  our  self-governing State in his speech at the opening of the\r\n\r\nAssembly said that the People's Action Party  would\r\n\r\ncarry out its Five-Year policy, but our friends on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  side are splitting hairs and expressing\r\n\r\ndoubts on all kinds of matters. It is difficult  to\r\n\r\nblame  them because for more than a hundred  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial  rulers  have  instilled  in  them  a\r\n\r\nslavish  education.  Such  a  mentality  cannot  be\r\n\r\neradicated in a short period of time. Therefore, in\r\n\r\nthe  speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it  is\r\n\r\nmentioned   that   the   political   and   economic\r\n\r\nrevolution  that have been started by us,  must  be\r\n\r\nsupported  by a cultural revolution.  It  was  also\r\n\r\nsaid    that   we   must   cultivate   a   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness. Not very much of this work was  done\r\n\r\nin  the  past. But the present Government  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to establish and to  instil  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of all our people here the will to create  a\r\n\r\nunited nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Culture, set up by the Government, has as its principal task the\r\n\r\ninstilling of a Malayan consciousness and  also  to\r\n\r\npromote  the interflow of culture between  all  the\r\n\r\nraces  here.  During the Colonial  regime  and  the\r\n\r\nslavish policy of enslavement, emphasis was  placed\r\n\r\non  individual enjoyment and also to propagate  the\r\n\r\nbelief  that  Westerners were better  than  Asians.\r\n\r\nThey  allowed yellow culture to poison the thinking\r\n\r\nof  our  youth. You can see in the cinemas, in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  in  the  mosquito  Press,   and   even\r\n\r\nsometimes  hear  from  the  radio,  the   kind   of\r\n\r\nmaterials  that  have been used  by  them  are  all\r\n\r\npornographic  or  full of sensation  in  character,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  murder, assassination, etc., in order  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  baser instincts of the  people,  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  youth  when  faced  with  such  kind  of\r\n\r\nmaterials would forget their own culture and forget\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of  national  construction.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  everybody will agree that during the  past\r\n\r\n100  years  or  more the Colonial Government  never\r\n\r\nonce  concerned itself with the establishment of  a\r\n\r\nnational   consciousness.  This  is  because   they\r\n\r\nintended to rule always over this place. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  there is a single Colonial  ruler  who\r\n\r\nwould  give up control over a Colony. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, colonial education had forgotten to instil in\r\n\r\nthe  youth  a spirit of sacrifice for the  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when the Government decided  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe allowance of the civil servants we explained to\r\n\r\nthem  very  carefully, that it was in the interests\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  and  its  future that we  had  done  this.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of the desire of the individual to\r\n\r\nentertain  himself, these people do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  sacrifice  for  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   Under   colonial   rule,   because    of\r\n\r\nrestrictions imposed by circumstances, the cultures\r\n\r\nof the Chinese, Malays and Indians were not allowed\r\n\r\nto  develop freely to promote healthy culture.  The\r\n\r\nbad elements in cultural activities have taken this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to advance themselves  and  they  have\r\n\r\npromoted yellow culture and, therefore, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  ever  since it  came  into  power  very\r\n\r\nquickly   adopted  anti-yellow  culture   movement.\r\n\r\nMembers  could  see in the Press or  probably  have\r\n\r\nseen  in the Press that we have banned a number  of\r\n\r\nmosquito  newspapers. We have also closed down  the\r\n\r\nplaces  that would promote and cultivate and foster\r\n\r\ngangsterism.   The   papers   have   reported   our\r\n\r\nactivities  and these activities have received  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming support of the people. This is  merely\r\n\r\na passive way of doing things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Ministry of Culture is a heavy\r\n\r\none, because its task is to nurture the thinking of\r\n\r\nthe  youth of Singapore. Therefore, we have adopted\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  reorganise  the  programmes  of   the\r\n\r\nvarious   races   that  are  broadcast   by   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore. In the past, Radio Singapore placed  too\r\n\r\nmuch   emphasis  on  English  programmes.  In  this\r\n\r\ndirection  we  are  taking steps to  improve  these\r\n\r\nthings. From the 2nd of August, we will have  quite\r\n\r\na  few new programmes in the Chinese section, There\r\n\r\nwill  be  symposiums  on  the  air - cultural  talks,\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  cultures  of   the   various\r\n\r\nraces - drama,   sporting  activities,   rural   area\r\n\r\nactivities,  a  women's magazine, trade  union  and\r\n\r\nschool activities, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have been in touch with various musical\r\n\r\nand  dramatic organisations to ask them to  put  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes at the Botanic Gardens and other  public\r\n\r\nplaces   to  stage  programmes,  to  show   healthy\r\n\r\ncultural  activities. These measures  taken  by  us\r\n\r\nhave got a dual purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want music and culture to be brought to the\r\n\r\nmasses  of the people. Everybody knows that in  the\r\n\r\npast, art and music are the monopoly of only a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  section  of  the  people.  We  can  see  the\r\n\r\nVictoria  Theatre. The past Governments  had  spent\r\n\r\nnearly  $2\u00bd million to construct such a luxurious\r\n\r\ntheatre  in order to allow a small section  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, wearing suits and neckties, to go in  there\r\n\r\nand  enjoy  themselves. Did they  know  music?  Not\r\n\r\nnecessarily. They merely went there to  let  people\r\n\r\nsee  them  and  know  that  they  belonged  to  the\r\n\r\nprivileged class. On one occasion, I in my capacity\r\n\r\nas  a reporter went to attend a concert. I was able\r\n\r\nto  see  with my own eyes such as I have described,\r\n\r\nMusic  had become the instrument by which  a  small\r\n\r\nsection  of  the  privileged people endeavoured  to\r\n\r\nenhance  their  own  social position,  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nlast  week  when  we  went to visit  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  we  were  able to see  that  a  so-called\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre had become the  private  club  of\r\n\r\ncertain  individuals. In one place we were able  to\r\n\r\nsee  only propaganda materials issued by the United\r\n\r\nStates  Information Service, How can the youth  who\r\n\r\ngrow  up  in these circumstances possibly  have  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of national problems? They have  been\r\n\r\nsubjugated  to  the  mental  enslavement   of   the\r\n\r\nColonialists. They have been influenced  by  ideals\r\n\r\nimported from foreign countries. How can we  foster\r\n\r\na mentality among the youth for them to be loyal to\r\n\r\nthis  country? Therefore, the duty of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture is to see that the youth of  all  races\r\n\r\nhere   are   able  to  develop  in   very   healthy\r\n\r\ncircumstances  an understanding and  a  loyalty  to\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the era of the privileged people is over, The People's Action Party represents the\r\n\r\ngreat   masses   of  the  people.   Everywhere   in\r\n\r\neverything that we do we always consider the people\r\n\r\nfirst.  We  hope that those people who have  hidden\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  the ivory tower - the musicians  and\r\n\r\nthe artists - will be able to come out and contribute\r\n\r\ntheir  art to the people and will become  one  with\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mass performances in music and art have\r\n\r\nanother meaning. It is intended that the music  and\r\n\r\nthe  art  of all the races interflow, so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople of the various races would be able to  enjoy\r\n\r\nand  appreciate the art and culture  of  the  other\r\n\r\nraces,  and  so  that in time the cultures  of  the\r\n\r\nthree major races of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry will become one Malayan culture.

The Singapore Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress  does not exist solely to look  after  the\r\n\r\nremunerations  of  Division  I  and   Division   II\r\n\r\nofficers of the Government service, who in any case\r\n\r\nare  not affiliated with the Singapore Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress. The Singapore Trades Union Congress works\r\n\r\nto improve the standard of living and conditions of\r\n\r\nemployment  of all workers of Singapore.  It  might\r\n\r\ninterest  the Member for Cairnhill to know  that  a\r\n\r\nvast  majority of workers in Singapore do not enjoy\r\n\r\neven 50 per cent of the salaries and allowances  at\r\n\r\npresent  enjoyed by the Division I and Division  II\r\n\r\nofficers of the Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Government, Sir, was elected into\r\n\r\noffice  by the overwhelming support of the  workers\r\n\r\nof Singapore. It is a Government which has publicly\r\n\r\nproclaimed  that it is on the side of the  workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, when the Minister for Finance  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  upholds  the  principles  of\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining and the  Whitley  machinery,\r\n\r\nthat  statement is good enough for the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the workers' movement  accept  that\r\n\r\nstatement.  Unlike  the  previous  Government,  the\r\n\r\nformer   Labour  Front  or  the  S.P.A.   Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  Minister  for  Finance  of   this\r\n\r\nGovernment did give an assurance to the  unions  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   employees  that  agreement   regarding\r\n\r\nvariable allowances will have retrospective  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  1st  July, 1959. In the past four years,  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.   Government   had  always   rejected   this\r\n\r\nprinciple of backdating an agreement. We would have\r\n\r\nthought,   Sir,   that  when  the  Government,   as\r\n\r\nemployer,  invited  the unions  to  negotiate,  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  unions  would  have  carried  out\r\n\r\nnegotiations  immediately  in  order  to  reach   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory agreement as soon as possible so  that\r\n\r\nthe  workers whom they represented would  have  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of knowing what lay  ahead.  But  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the so-called Council of Joint  Action\r\n\r\nare  not  prepared to negotiate under  the  Whitley\r\n\r\nmachinery,   for  in  negotiation  they   find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  present a case but it is  easier  to\r\n\r\nseek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublicity  for  themselves. Sir,  there  were  many\r\n\r\nunions   outside  the  Government   service   whose\r\n\r\ndifficulty in the past had always been to bring the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  the  negotiating table.  In  private\r\n\r\nindustry, it has always been impossible for  unions\r\n\r\neither to bring the case to the Labour Ministry  or\r\n\r\ndirectly   to   bring   the  managements   to   the\r\n\r\nnegotiating  table;  but  here  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice,  the  Government has offered  negotiations\r\n\r\nand the unions have rejected them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill further said that he\r\n\r\nthought  deeply  about the Singapore  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  having  executive powers.  No  doubt  his\r\n\r\nthinking was assisted by officials of a Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  as  usual. Sir, the workers of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  followed  the thoughts and the  actions  that\r\n\r\nfollowed the thoughts of the former Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nand  they  did not like at all what they  saw.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  showed their dislike for the former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's thoughts and actions by giving  a  sound\r\n\r\nbeating to the Singapore People's Alliance on  30th\r\n\r\nMay.  That  was  the  answer  of  the  workers   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the former Chief Minister's  interest\r\n\r\nin  trade unionism. Previous Governments,  for  the\r\n\r\nsake of satisfying public opinion, probably, made a\r\n\r\npretence of supporting trade unionism; but in  fact\r\n\r\nboth  by administrative and legislative action they\r\n\r\nmade  it  impossible for big and strong  unions  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the legitimate activities  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.   Previous   Governments   also   introduced\r\n\r\nlegislation which gave any seven persons the  right\r\n\r\nto  form  a trade union. In fact, Sir, a  man,  his\r\n\r\nwife  and  five children can form a union  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.   By   this  means,  previous  Governments\r\n\r\nintended  to  show the world that in Singapore  you\r\n\r\ncan  have as many unions as possible, and therefore\r\n\r\nthe  workers  have  all the rights  to  form  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  What they did not wish to publish was  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  it was the weakness of the  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich permitted so many unions to exist in the same\r\n\r\nindustry.  This is the weakness of the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement, We have, Sir, as a result of that  policy\r\n\r\nin Singapore today 225 unions organising a total of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout 130,000 workers, and when this is compared to\r\n\r\nabout  450,000 workers in Singapore, it is easy  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  only 30 per cent of the  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have been organised though there are  200\r\n\r\nunions too many. In these 225 unions, there are  at\r\n\r\nleast 24 unions, each of whose membership does  not\r\n\r\nexceed 50, and there are unions with seven and  ten\r\n\r\nmembers.   There  are  eight  general   unions   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, each competing for the same category  of\r\n\r\nmembers. Our Government, Sir, has seen the weakness\r\n\r\nof  this and has categorically stated that it  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the trade union movement.  One  of  the\r\n\r\nmeans of strengthening the trade union movement  is\r\n\r\nto  give  executive powers to the Singapore  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress or any other central  organisation.\r\n\r\nThe  present Singapore Trades Union Congress, which\r\n\r\nwas set up eight years ago and which by legislation\r\n\r\nis not permitted to have executive but only to have\r\n\r\nadvisors  powers, is weak and ineffective and  many\r\n\r\nunions  do  not  have confidence in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress. The past Government, keeping\r\n\r\nin  line  with its policy to favour the management,\r\n\r\nthe   exploiting  classes  and  the   colonialists,\r\n\r\nrefused  the  demands of unions  that  the  central\r\n\r\norganisation   should   have   executive    powers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  you find the trade union movement  that\r\n\r\nexists  in  Singapore was not able  to  hinder  the\r\n\r\nactivities   of  the  unscrupulous  employers   and\r\n\r\ncolonialists who exploited the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction between policy and action was\r\n\r\nto be expected from the past Government, since they\r\n\r\nserved  the  interest  of  the  colonialists.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment is pledged to serve the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of this country. We recognise that  one  of\r\n\r\nthe   most   important  conditions   before   sound\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations  can be  established  is  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a trade union movement that  is  well\r\n\r\norganised,  unified, responsible,  disciplined  and\r\n\r\nconfident. Confidence and responsibility  born  out\r\n\r\nof a realisation of its own strength, knowledge and\r\n\r\nability of its own to negotiate and reach agreement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith management. A trade union movement, because of\r\n\r\nthe  organisation and resources that it  possesses,\r\n\r\nis able to carry on collective bargaining backed by\r\n\r\nfacts,  figures  and sound reasoning.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible  to have industrial peace if the  unions\r\n\r\nare  weak  and  divided. It is impossible  for  the\r\n\r\nunions  to  be strong and disciplined  as  long  as\r\n\r\ntheir   own  central  organisations  do  not   have\r\n\r\nexecutive   powers.  Since  industrial   peace   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely essential for the speedy realisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic  progress  of  the  country,  it   is\r\n\r\nimperative  that  the trade union movement  is  re-organised    and   assisted,   as   suggested    in\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to suspend this Assembly\r\n\r\ntill half-past five.

However, we have full confidence\r\n\r\nin  carrying  out our work. We are aware  that  our\r\n\r\npolicy  has got the support of the majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, and at the same time we  know\r\n\r\nour   policy   will  bring  about  happier   living\r\n\r\nconditions for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  women. We are aware  that  women  are\r\n\r\nfound  in every corner of society. They have hands,\r\n\r\nfeet,  and brains too. They are among those members\r\n\r\nwho have built up society, and they also constitute\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the human society. But under  colonial\r\n\r\nrule  and in a feudalistic society, and because  of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  Government they were  oppressed  and\r\n\r\nexploited  and  were  not  able  to  develop  their\r\n\r\nworking ability. Now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  the care of the new Government most  of  the\r\n\r\nwomen  in  this country will eventually  understand\r\n\r\nand  realise their responsibilities of  working  in\r\n\r\nthis new society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we fully support the 48 items\r\n\r\nof our policy. The Government will legislate on the\r\n\r\nabolition of polygamy which, if committed, will  be\r\n\r\nregarded as a crime. But this will not apply to the\r\n\r\nMuslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Government will further\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  the  Department of Society  Welfare.\r\n\r\nDuring  this  short space of time we have  received\r\n\r\nsome  tragic complaints from women. 99 per cent  of\r\n\r\ntheir problems were due to polygamy. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust   immediately  stop  aggravating  this  tragic\r\n\r\nincidence. We therefore fully support the 48  items\r\n\r\nin our policy statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  may begin by referring to the speech of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture. In his address, he said  that\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for  various political parties  having\r\n\r\ndisappeared  from the political scene  was  because\r\n\r\nthese  parties did not have any appeal to the  mass\r\n\r\nof  the people in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government has been elected under the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution  which assures this  country  complete\r\n\r\ninternal   self-government.   Now   this   complete\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government did  not  come  about  by\r\n\r\nliving in a world of fantasy, or by waving a  magic\r\n\r\nwand.  Someone had to work for it, someone obtained\r\n\r\nit,  and  the fruits of somebody's labour have  now\r\n\r\ngone  to the P.A.P. Government. That is so in  most\r\n\r\naspects  of  life - someone works hard,  and  another\r\n\r\nreaps  the benefit. One does not quarrel with that;\r\n\r\nlife is like that. The P.A.P. will work hard today,\r\n\r\nand  somebody else will reap the benefit  tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSo let not the P.A.P. laugh or scoff at the Parties\r\n\r\nand  the persons who have done their best to  bring\r\n\r\nout the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve years is not a long time, Mr Speaker, in\r\n\r\nany  political  experiment or in any  struggle  for\r\n\r\nself-government. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nidea  and  the hope of gaining self-government  for\r\n\r\nthis  island did not begin to stir actively in  the\r\n\r\nhearts  and  minds of the people  until  after  the\r\n\r\nJapanese occupation. It had been a thought  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the people before the Japanese occupation,\r\n\r\nbut  it became a spiritual necessity, it became  an\r\n\r\nurge   after  the  Japanese  left  the  Colony   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Yes,  it was after the  advent  of  the\r\n\r\nreoccupation  that  the people  of  Singapore  went\r\n\r\nforward with the purpose and aim of bringing  about\r\n\r\nself-government  for  this  island  as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible. That has been achieved in the short space\r\n\r\nof twelve years. So let us, therefore, not scoff at\r\n\r\nthe Parties or the persons who have been able in  a\r\n\r\npeaceable   manner   to   bring   about   our   new\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the speech of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, I had hoped he would have set out the\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy of his Government for the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.  We know the intellectual attainments of  our\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance; we know his calibre  as  an\r\n\r\neconomist;  and  we  know his stature  as  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant.  With  these  three qualities  working  in\r\n\r\nunison  to  help the Minister, Mr Speaker,  I  was\r\n\r\neagerly  awaiting  some pronouncement  which  would\r\n\r\ngive  an  indication  to this Assembly  as  to  the\r\n\r\nfinancial future of this country during the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.   But  instead  of  making  a  statement   on\r\n\r\nfinancial policy, he indulged himself in a  lecture\r\n\r\nto  this House on fantasies and realities, He  said\r\n\r\nthat  civil servants were suffering from  fantasies\r\n\r\nand that the sooner they got down to realities, the\r\n\r\nbetter  it  would be for all of them. Perhaps,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  civil servants were  living  in  the\r\n\r\nrealm  of fantasy. Who could blame them? The  truth\r\n\r\nof  the  matter is that there were present  amongst\r\n\r\nthem  four  such good storytellers and actors  that\r\n\r\nthey  were able to produce the fantasies which kept\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants in line with them.  The  civil\r\n\r\nservants had with them the four musketeers,  Athos,\r\n\r\nPorthos,  Aramis  and  D'Artagnan,  the  man  whose\r\n\r\nrapier  never failed to reach its mark.  Who  could\r\n\r\ntherefore  blame the civil servants? If they  lived\r\n\r\nin a world of fantasy, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  fantastic world was created for them by  none\r\n\r\nother   than  Athos,  Porthos,  Aramis,   and   the\r\n\r\nindomitable D'Artagnan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, quite recently the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance talked over the radio. It is the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  present Government that each of its  Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  keep  in touch with the people by  bringing\r\n\r\nhimself  over  the air and into the  homes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. It is a very good thing, a very good  thing\r\n\r\nindeed.  In  the  radio talk of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, his first preoccupation was with the  role\r\n\r\nof  the civil servant in the State of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nam  grateful to the Minister for having set out the\r\n\r\nviews  of  his Government on what the role  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil servant should be in a state such as ours.  I\r\n\r\nmyself have ideas on what that role should be and I\r\n\r\nwas exceedingly interested to hear the views of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, who himself has been a  civil\r\n\r\nservant  of high eminence. Listening to his speech,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I hoped that perhaps he, as  Head  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry which deals with all civil  servants,\r\n\r\nwould in one of his future broadcasts also tell  us\r\n\r\nwhat  the role of a Minister should be in a  system\r\n\r\nof  government  such as ours; and that  perhaps  he\r\n\r\nmight  also go on to tell us what the role  of  the\r\n\r\nBack-benchers on the Government seats should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister made a pronouncement that Government Back-benchers have a role to play in the democracy  that\r\n\r\nhe was contemplating. I, Mr Speaker, was not aware\r\n\r\nthat   Back-benchers  had  a  role  in  the  active\r\n\r\ngoverning  of  a State such as ours. But  naturally\r\n\r\none  would be delighted and one would want to  know\r\n\r\nwhat the Prime Minister's conception of the role of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Back-bencher  in  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education in his speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, said that $63\u00bd million of the\r\n\r\nnational  budget of Singapore is spent on Education\r\n\r\nand that all of this $63\u00bd million - I speak subject\r\n\r\nto  correction,  Mr Speaker - went towards  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think it was the Minister for Labour and\r\n\r\nLaw  who said that 42 per cent of the total revenue\r\n\r\nof  Singapore went to personal emoluments. He  also\r\n\r\ndrew   a   comparison  that  the   total   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments in the Budget of the United Kingdom  was\r\n\r\n15  per cent. Mr Speaker, I think the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law, possibly inadvertently, failed also\r\n\r\nto  mention  in the same breath that  the  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments,  in so far as education in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom goes, do not appear in the national Budget;\r\n\r\nthat  the  personal emoluments in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nmedical services in the United Kingdom go,  do  not\r\n\r\nappear  in  the national Budget; that the  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments, in so far as the United Kingdom  police\r\n\r\nforce  goes, do not appear in the national  Budget,\r\n\r\nwhereas   all  these  three  expensive   heads   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  do appear in our national  Budget.  As\r\n\r\nthe hon. Minister for Education said, a quarter  of\r\n\r\nour national Budget goes to education. The two most\r\n\r\nexpensive  items  on  personal  emoluments  in  our\r\n\r\nBudget,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, are, first,  education;\r\n\r\nand, second, medical services. These two items  are\r\n\r\nsignificantly  absent from the national  Budget  of\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom. These items appear  either  in\r\n\r\nthe budgets of the local Government authorities  or\r\n\r\nthey appear as subventions moving from the national\r\n\r\nGovernment  to various boards and local  government\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely mention this, Mr Speaker, because the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education and the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand Law mentioned these facts to the House in order\r\n\r\nto bolster up the Government's case for cutting the\r\n\r\nsalary   of   civil   servants.   Employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship  is  a  matter  entirely  between  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the employee. But the manner in  which\r\n\r\nthese salary cuts have been brought about, and  the\r\n\r\nostensible reasons put out by responsible Ministers\r\n\r\nfor  these  cuts, is not only the  concern  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer and employee but also the concern  of  the\r\n\r\npeople at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the reasons given by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance when he was about to introduce\r\n\r\nthese  cuts  were  two-fold.

These  reasons\r\n\r\nhad  impelled  him  into cutting  the  salaries  of\r\n\r\nGovernment servants by doing away with most of  the\r\n\r\nvariable allowances for certain categories and  all\r\n\r\nof them for the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, variable allowances are called\r\n\r\nvariable allowances because it was said at one time\r\n\r\nor  other  that the cuts could be effected.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  Mr Speaker, the justification for  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  these  cuts can be either that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  has gone down or that the national  economy\r\n\r\nhas reached the stage where it is imperative to cut\r\n\r\nthese  allowances.  Nobody has suggested  that  the\r\n\r\ncost of living in Singapore has gone down after the\r\n\r\nadvent of the P.A.P. Government. If anything, it is\r\n\r\nsuggested that it has gone up. Therefore, the  only\r\n\r\nother reason which could have impelled the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to take this drastically quick  action\r\n\r\nwas  the  state  of  the national  economy - the  $14\r\n\r\nmillion threatened deficit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we are told that \"the immediate  task\r\n\r\nfacing  the Government is to place the finances  of\r\n\r\nthe  country  on  a  sound and healthy  basis.  The\r\n\r\nthreatened deficit of $14 million for 1959 can  and\r\n\r\nwill  be wiped out..\" The phrase used, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  \"the  threatened  deficit\".  So  why  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance was making such play about the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Member for Tanglin I am at a loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand.  He himself used the words  \"threatened\r\n\r\ndeficit\", not a deficit which has come into  being.\r\n\r\nSo, therefore, the phrase \"threatened leak\" used by\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Tanglin  is  still  appropriate,\r\n\r\nwhereas the Minister's statement that the boat  has\r\n\r\nsprung a leak already and is filling with water  is\r\n\r\nnot  borne  out  by  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I was hoping that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nin  his  speech would tell us how it was  that  the\r\n\r\npast  Government had wasted the reserve fund  built\r\n\r\nup so laboriously by the previous Governments which\r\n\r\nare now being pooh-poohed and scoffed at by certain\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Government. He has not in any  part\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  speech indicated how, where or in what respect\r\n\r\nthere has been wasteful expenditure. I would in all\r\n\r\nearnestness  suggest  to the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nthat  the exchange of one capital asset for another\r\n\r\ncapital   asset   is   not  wasteful   expenditure,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when the exchanged capital  asset  is\r\n\r\nbringing to the Government revenues on the invested\r\n\r\ncapital asset. I would suggest to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  that  most of these moneys which  he  says\r\n\r\nhave  been  wasted by the previous Government  have\r\n\r\ngone  into such assets. Whether it remains  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of money assets, or whether it remains  in  a\r\n\r\nchanged  form  such as buildings  and  houses  that\r\n\r\npeople  can  live in, is not wasteful  expenditure,\r\n\r\nbut sound finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may now divert to the\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It seems  to\r\n\r\nme,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the two important items\r\n\r\nin  the  speech are when the Government  says  that\r\n\r\n\"the  prime  task  is  to build  up  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth can take place\" and  the  other,\r\n\r\ntowards  the end of the speech, where the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara says that in so far as the State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  concerned, it is  the  intention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  create and bring  about  conditions\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  a  union or  integration  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Mr Speaker, Sir, these are the\r\n\r\ntwo  important  factors in the speech  which  would\r\n\r\nbring  about a state of affairs in Singapore  which\r\n\r\nwould  mean peace, happiness and prosperity to  all\r\n\r\nof  us.  If  either one of these objectives  fails,\r\n\r\nthen  the future of Singapore is indeed bleak. Soon\r\n\r\nafter the speech had been delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a  wave\r\n\r\nof  confidence  in  Singapore.  But  I  venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Hon. Prime Minister that to  create\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  country,  one  speech  is  not\r\n\r\nenough, particularly when several others have  been\r\n\r\nmade prior to this one which tended to destroy that\r\n\r\nconfidence.  Therefore,  it  is  now  left  to  the\r\n\r\nactions  of  the P.A.P. to build up  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and\r\n\r\nindustrial growth can take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as a Member of the opposition, I feel it is my duty to support the Government in\r\n\r\nevery  measure and in any measure that is  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral benefit of the State of Singapore. I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is  hope  in the speech, and if  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncarry  out the policy speech, as we hope they will,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think  the future of Singapore  is  bright\r\n\r\nindeed. But Mr Speaker, Sir, there are signs  that\r\n\r\nin  certain aspects, what the P.A.P. say  and  what\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. do, does not seem to follow one  track.\r\n\r\nThe  first thing they did as soon as they came into\r\n\r\npower  was  to  impose salary  cuts  on  Government\r\n\r\nservants. Now, as to the manner in which they  were\r\n\r\nimposed - the  Minister for Finance said  that  there\r\n\r\nhad  been  negotiations. As far as I am aware,  the\r\n\r\nfirst meeting was called by the Government on  19th\r\n\r\nJune  and on the 20th June the whole thing had been\r\n\r\nimplemented,  by  way  of  circulars   to   various\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments.   In   the   history   of\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  between  employer\r\n\r\nand  employee. I venture to suggest  this  was  the\r\n\r\nmost  successful  piece of negotiation,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen one remembers that it was the employer who had\r\n\r\nbrought the employee to the negotiating table  with\r\n\r\na view to cutting salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the only way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It had been suggested by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill that it would have been possible for\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  bring  these  people  to  the\r\n\r\nnegotiating  table  and  to  tell  them  about  the\r\n\r\neconomic   plight  of  the  country,  the  wasteful\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the previous government and that  it\r\n\r\nwas a matter of life and death for these cuts to be\r\n\r\nimposed.  Is it being suggested that civil servants\r\n\r\nare  callous,  and  only interested  in  their  own\r\n\r\npecuniary profits from their work? A modus operandi\r\n\r\ncould have been arrived at; an agreement could have\r\n\r\nbeen reached that the cut should operate as from  a\r\n\r\ncertain date. The Deputy Speaker has suggested that\r\n\r\nthis was not possible. I venture to suggest that it\r\n\r\nis possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the salary of the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General  was moved in this  Assembly,  and\r\n\r\nwhen I touched\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupon a topic, you ruled me out of order because  it\r\n\r\nwas not pertinent to that particular issue. I think\r\n\r\nthat the issue which I raised then, is relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe motion now before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State Advocate-General, Mr Speaker, Sir - his\r\n\r\nappointment  is  governed  by  section  30  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council.  Section\r\n\r\n30 subsection (4), reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The State Advocate-General may be appointed for\r\n\r\na  specified  period and, if he was  so  appointed,\r\n\r\nshall, subject to the provisions of subsection  (6)\r\n\r\nof   this   section,  vacate  his  office  (without\r\n\r\nprejudice to his eligibility for re-appointment) at\r\n\r\nthe  expiration  of that period,  but,  subject  as\r\n\r\naforesaid,  shall otherwise hold  office  until  he\r\n\r\nattains the age of fifty-five:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this section in the Constitution makes it\r\n\r\npossible for the Government in power to appoint the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General if they think fit from  year\r\n\r\nto  year,  unlike  the  Auditor-General  who,  once\r\n\r\nappointed,  holds  his  post  until  the   age   of\r\n\r\nretirement.  Both these offices - the office  of  the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General  and  the  office  of   the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General - are  important  posts   under   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   The  Constitution   makes   special\r\n\r\nprovision for these two offices because the  nature\r\n\r\nof  these offices is such that the holders of these\r\n\r\noffices  must be left free to carry out the  duties\r\n\r\nof   their  posts  without  looking  behind   their\r\n\r\nshoulder  all the time at a Minister who  might  be\r\n\r\nbehind  their  backs.  I  am  not  suggesting,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that in this particular case it is so, for\r\n\r\nI  have  too great a respect for the present holder\r\n\r\nof  this  office to suggest that such  a  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs could ensue from this appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But it is possible that when the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister ceases to be  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nthere  could be some other Prime Minister who might\r\n\r\nmisuse  that provision in the Constitution. It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, important that before a State  Advocate-General  has been appointed, care should  be  taken\r\n\r\nthat  he  is a fit and proper person to  hold  that\r\n\r\noffice.  But  once he is appointed,  he,  like  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General, should hold office until he is 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest to the Hon. the Prime Minister that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a defect in the Constitution and that  he\r\n\r\ntake   early   steps   to   remedy   this   defect?\r\n\r\n[Interruption].

Section  29,  subsection   (1),   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There shall be for each Ministry one or more\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries who shall be persons who  are\r\n\r\npublic officers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (3), Mr Speaker, Sir, the one I am\r\n\r\nconcerned with at the moment, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every Permanent Secretary shall, subject to the\r\n\r\ngeneral  direction  and control  of  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nexercise   supervision  over  the   department   or\r\n\r\ndepartments to which he is allocated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read that section in the Constitution, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it means this - that  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  shall  exercise  supervision  over   the\r\n\r\ndepartment or departments to which he is  allocated\r\n\r\nsubject  of course always to the general  direction\r\n\r\nof  his  Minister.

Although the Rendel Constitution  as  a\r\n\r\nconstitution is now dead, we have still remnants of\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel  era  and the pre-Rendel  era  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship which the captain and his crew under the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution have navigated for four  years\r\n\r\nhas   now  sunk,  and  a  new  ship - the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - is now being manned by a strong, youthful\r\n\r\nand  virile  crew and this ship, we are  confident,\r\n\r\nwill  chart  and pave the way to all the  hopes  to\r\n\r\nwhich we the people have aspired for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we understand the limitations of the present Constitution, which do restrain the\r\n\r\npolitical  power of the elected representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe people. We do understand those limitations.  We\r\n\r\ndo  understand that the elected Government  has  to\r\n\r\nwork  within certain defined powers and that  there\r\n\r\nare  curbs  and  restrictions on those  powers  and\r\n\r\nfunctions  which a normal fully elected  Government\r\n\r\nis supposed to exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we also understand that within the island state of Singapore, we also have limitations\r\n\r\non  our  economy, limitations which even a magician\r\n\r\nturned Minister for Finance cannot solve.

For  many\r\n\r\nyears, particularly during the past four years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  that  it was nothing but  inefficiency,\r\n\r\nwaste,  corruption and filth everywhere.

When we were in the City Council,\r\n\r\nour powers were as limited within the framework  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution as our powers now in the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment are limited within the present framework\r\n\r\nof  the  new Constitution. But we will be taking  a\r\n\r\nwrong   move   if   we   refuse   to   accept   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are working the Constitution hoping that the day will soon dawn on our people\r\n\r\nwhen  we shall breathe the fresh air of freedom  as\r\n\r\nour  brethren in the Federation and other parts  in\r\n\r\nAsia  do  breathe. Our way is the way  of  ultimate\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger with  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nand  before  that  is achieved we  have  to  accept\r\n\r\nwhatever limitations are imposed on this Government\r\n\r\nby   the   so-called  new  Constitution - limitations\r\n\r\nimposed  on  us in this island State  with  no  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term policy - that is, the providing\r\n\r\nof  the  basic  necessities of  life  to  the  1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion people of this island - and in our long-term\r\n\r\npolicy of attainment of re-unification of Singapore\r\n\r\nand   the  Federation  of  Malaya,  one  thing   is\r\n\r\nparamount  and that is, Mr Speaker, the  unity  of\r\n\r\nall  the communities and the races in Malaya. I may\r\n\r\nnot  entirely  agree  with the leader  of  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\n(Tunku Abdul Rahman) in his political policies, but\r\n\r\nI  must admit that he is a man of far vision and in\r\n\r\nthe  Sunday  papers he has said that  the  greatest\r\n\r\nenemy now in our midst is communalism. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  communalism, as the Tunku has  said,  is  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  enemy  in our midst.  As  the  Tunku  has\r\n\r\nattacked and sworn at communalism in the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya, we in Singapore should echo his call and\r\n\r\nwe should try to stamp out in this little island of\r\n\r\nours any kind of communalism in our midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limitations of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nthe  role  of  the  Opposition is  even  much  more\r\n\r\nimportant than ever. The role of the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nto provide constructive criticism to the Government\r\n\r\nand not just to attack the Government in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  its policies. We have heard speeches from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Benches and I have not even  heard  for\r\n\r\none  single moment any Opposition speaker give  any\r\n\r\nconstructive ideas. Perhaps the hon. Members in the\r\n\r\nOpposition are not capable of doing it.  Then  what\r\n\r\nthey should do is not to speak too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one single theme which strings across\r\n\r\nthe  speeches of the eight Opposition  Members  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  nothing  but the variable  allowances  of\r\n\r\n4,000  members  of the civil service - or  even  less\r\n\r\nthan that. They say that the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara is good and that there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  with  it. Perhaps Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  speech spoken  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore is a practical,  sensible\r\n\r\nand  modest  approach  to the  problems  of  a  new\r\n\r\nGovernment  in its first term of office.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  Members of the  Opposition  should\r\n\r\nhave  spent so many days and yet were not  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute any constructive idea to the running  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government machinery but just  to  attack  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, especially the Minister for Finance and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law, on the recent cut\r\n\r\nin  variable allowance, Just now, Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park said that the deficit in The 1959 Budget is only a threatened deficit.\r\n\r\nYes,  Mr Speaker, it is only a threatened deficit because it\r\n\r\ncannot be otherwise. We have not completed the year\r\n\r\n1959  and the Minister for Finance could only  make\r\n\r\nan  estimate that until something is done it  would\r\n\r\nbe  a deficit. Mr Speaker, we do not wait, as  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Government and the other  Governments  did,\r\n\r\nfor  the  ship to sink first before we take action.\r\n\r\nWe  have no time left to wait for the ship to  sink\r\n\r\nfirst.  We  have  to take action  immediately.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has to take drastic action  immediately\r\n\r\nin  the  interest  of  the national  economy.  Such\r\n\r\nactions  could  have been prolonged or  delayed  if\r\n\r\nprevious   Governments  had  not  spent  money   so\r\n\r\nwastefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park was asking just now\r\n\r\nfor  evidence of wasteful expenditure  in  previous\r\n\r\nyears. Mr Speaker, in one of the departments in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy Ministry, all the expatriates can leave and even\r\n\r\nif  two-thirds of the local officers leave, we  can\r\n\r\nstill run as efficiently as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park mentioned that finance\r\n\r\nwas    squandered   not   on   annually   recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  but  perhaps on  buildings.  Buildings\r\n\r\nlike  the  expensive S.I.T. houses, buildings  like\r\n\r\nthe expensive bungalows in Kay Siang Road built for\r\n\r\nS.I.T. expatriate officers in which the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park had taken a hand - this is what he  said\r\n\r\nis  not  wasteful expenditure! I do not  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  is meant by wasteful expenditure. Perhaps  it\r\n\r\nis  not  wasteful expenditure as far as that  small\r\n\r\ngroup  of  members comprising vested interests  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, but it is wasteful expenditure as far as\r\n\r\nthe people are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked the Government\r\n\r\nwhat  the  role of a Minister is. Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  a  Minister in the P.A.P.  Government  is\r\n\r\ndifferent from the role of a Minister in the Rendel\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Minister in the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nreally  works and slogs. He does not leave anything\r\n\r\nresponsible in the hands of the civil servants.  We\r\n\r\nhave  noticed  that under the Rendel  Constitution,\r\n\r\nfour  or  five Ministers can go on leave to  Japan,\r\n\r\nHongkong and other places, and yet the machinery of\r\n\r\nGovernment carries on. The P.A.P. Minister  is  one\r\n\r\nwho  believes  in sincere and honest  work  and  in\r\n\r\nleading  a team of good, honest and sincere workers\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service to work likewise, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that the civil service worked so hard for the\r\n\r\npeople in the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked also what the\r\n\r\nrole of a Back-Bencher is in the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nThe role of a Back-bencher in the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nis  similar to the role of a Minister in  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment - nothing  but  work  and  work.  All  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Assemblymen  are sent to  their  respective\r\n\r\nMinistries just to slog and to work. For  instance,\r\n\r\nin my Ministry of National Development, in addition\r\n\r\nto  the  Parliamentary Secretary, there  are  seven\r\n\r\nAssemblymen who have given up their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs  in order to work for the Party. They are  now\r\n\r\ngetting  less,  Mr Speaker. They get  $500  as  an\r\n\r\nallowance  out of which they contribute an  average\r\n\r\nof $250 a month to the Party and out of the $250  a\r\n\r\nmonth they pay $50 for transport allowance, They do\r\n\r\nnothing but slog in the Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, a few days ago, an Opposition\r\n\r\nMember   mentioned  parliamentary   democracy.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve   that,  on  the  Government  Benches,   we\r\n\r\nunderstand   more   about   the   fundamentals   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy  than  do  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers,  because we believe that for democracy  to\r\n\r\nwork,  we  must  not only understand  the  form  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  but  its very essence. The  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nexpressed the fear that the majority in a democracy\r\n\r\nmight  not respect the rights of the minority,  but\r\n\r\nas  our  Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned during\r\n\r\nthe  motion on the Committee of Selection, although\r\n\r\nthe  minority is less than one-sixth of  the  total\r\n\r\nmembership  of this House, it has been  given  two-sixths  of  the representation on the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection.  Mr  Speaker,  we  do  understand   the\r\n\r\nessence of democracy better than many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since we cannot expect much constructive efforts from the Opposition, we have\r\n\r\nto  rely  entirely on the people who have given  us\r\n\r\nstrength and hope. We do ask them to contribute  to\r\n\r\nus ideas of how to run the Government machinery and\r\n\r\nto  bring  their  daily problems to our  attention,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe  that if  we  do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nconstructive  Opposition, the best  thing  to  have\r\n\r\nis - and  we do have it - an intelligent public opinion\r\n\r\nand  a  people who will always be ready to  support\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, it is especially important in\r\n\r\nthe work in my Ministry that the support of all the\r\n\r\npeople  is required. In my Ministry, there are  two\r\n\r\nurgent  tasks confronting us. The first one is  the\r\n\r\ngrave  and urgent task of building houses  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  second  task  is  the  planning   and\r\n\r\nexecution  of  a rural programme, to bring  to  the\r\n\r\nhalf  a  million  people  in  the  rural  areas   a\r\n\r\nprogramme which will modernise the rural areas, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we are now left with a very acute  housing\r\n\r\nshortage. In my first week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  office. I received more than 1,000 applications\r\n\r\nfor  houses.  We  are now left with  a  very  acute\r\n\r\nhousing shortage and due to wasteful expenditure in\r\n\r\nthe past - Mr Speaker, Christmas Island was sold for\r\n\r\nonly  $20  million,  and I am sure  the  phosphates\r\n\r\nthere  cost  many times more - we find ourselves  not\r\n\r\nhaving sufficient funds to build all the houses  we\r\n\r\nwant to build. The S.I.T. has been building in past\r\n\r\nyears  an average of 2,000 units per year. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient,  In order to  catch  up  with  the\r\n\r\nshortage,  at  least  10,000  units  a   year   are\r\n\r\nnecessary. Moreover, in the past years, the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhas  been  building houses not meant for the  lower\r\n\r\nincome groups, because if houses were built for the\r\n\r\nlower income groups, there would be less chance  of\r\n\r\ncorruption.  The poor people cannot pay  for  their\r\n\r\nhouses. From now onwards, Mr Speaker, the emphasis\r\n\r\nwill be on houses for the lower income groups,  and\r\n\r\nmore houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important aspect confronting the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development is the interest of\r\n\r\nhalf  a  million residents in the rural  areas  who\r\n\r\nhave been completely ignored in the past. With  the\r\n\r\npast  regime, it was nothing but mere eyewash - \"Form\r\n\r\nthat   commission,   that   department   and   this\r\n\r\ndepartment.\" The P.A.P. Government does  not  talk.\r\n\r\nIt  works  and, as a first step, it has united  all\r\n\r\nthese multifarious and small departments under  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  into one administrative  unit.\r\n\r\nThe  Fisheries Department, Agricultural Department,\r\n\r\nVeterinary Department, Animal Husbandry Department,\r\n\r\nand the Rural Development Commission, together with\r\n\r\nmany   other  small  departments  from  other   co-operatives  come  under the Department  of  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction. The P.A.P. Government is now working on\r\n\r\na  programme to serve Malay rural dwellers  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage them in the task of national construction\r\n\r\nand   national  development.  Surveys   are   being\r\n\r\nprepared  to  provide standpipes for and  to  bring\r\n\r\nelectricity  to  the kampongs, and  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill assist them to modernize the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government does not believe in\r\n\r\ncharity.  We  believe that everyone - man,  woman  or\r\n\r\nchild - in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  must play his or her part in the  task  of\r\n\r\nnational  construction. We do not believe  in  just\r\n\r\nidle  living. Everybody must contribute his or  her\r\n\r\nbit.   The   P.A.P.  Government  will  make   every\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  make the farmers contribute  to  our\r\n\r\nnational  economy by increasing production  in  the\r\n\r\nfields   of   agriculture,  animal  husbandry   and\r\n\r\nfisheries development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Ministers and the Back-benchers of the P.A.P. Government work. The Party members in\r\n\r\nour  Party work, and we have every confidence  that\r\n\r\nthe 1\u00bd million people in Singapore will also work\r\n\r\nthe  same  way  as we do. This is  what  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said - nice things do not  just  come\r\n\r\ndown from the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are faced at present with a serious shortage of land in Singapore, partly due\r\n\r\nto  the  previous administration in  not  having  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  land  rationing. It is recognized  that\r\n\r\nwhile our population increases in number every day,\r\n\r\nthe  amount of land available to the people  always\r\n\r\nremains the same, and therefore it is vital for the\r\n\r\npresent generation as well as the future generation\r\n\r\nto  evolve a sound land policy. Much of Singapore's\r\n\r\nland  is either occupied by catchment areas, burial\r\n\r\ngrounds, or by the British armed forces. Much  land\r\n\r\nis covered by tidal or mangrove swamps and there is\r\n\r\nalso  land  where cultivation is not possible.  The\r\n\r\nprevious  administration never even  thought  of  a\r\n\r\nland policy. We shall put up plans for a sound land\r\n\r\npolicy, so that whatever land we are left with  can\r\n\r\nbe  made  use of wisely. Just to give an indication\r\n\r\nof our present acute shortage of land: Commerce and\r\n\r\nindustry and residents take up 23 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  area  of  209 square miles of the  mainland.\r\n\r\nTidal swamps take up 11 per cent; the British armed\r\n\r\nforces  absorb  11  per cent; the  catchment  areas\r\n\r\nabsorb  6.2 per cent. Mr Speaker, all these amount\r\n\r\nto  a  total of 51.2 per cent of useless land. Land\r\n\r\nheld  by  various authorities for special  purposes\r\n\r\nembraces a further 3.8 per cent; roads and  rivers,\r\n\r\n3.3  per cent; nothing much is left for the  people\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultivate  or for future development purposes.  Who\r\n\r\nis to blame for all these?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we believe that in this transitional stage of our history and that before we can attain\r\n\r\nindependence through merger with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, it is important that there should be  great\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between  the  Government   and   the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  that there should be a common  united\r\n\r\neffort of everyone in this country, so that many of\r\n\r\nthe problems which are facing us now - for instance,\r\n\r\nthe    problem    of    land   shortage,    housing\r\n\r\nshortage - which  is connected with industrialisation\r\n\r\nand  urbanisation - and  the problems  of  the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers could be more easily solved. Depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  nine Ministers, or depending on the 43  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Government benches, or depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  tens of thousands of members in our Party,  it\r\n\r\nis not sufficient. We believe that in the difficult\r\n\r\ntimes  ahead, which will last many, many years,  it\r\n\r\nis  important for every person in this  country  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  limitations,  firstly,   of   our\r\n\r\nConstitution,  and secondly, of  our  economy,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  are certain things which no Government\r\n\r\ncan  do, and no Minister for Finance can solve.  So\r\n\r\nlong as we have that understanding, and so long  as\r\n\r\nwe have everybody working in a joint united effort,\r\n\r\nwe  are  confident we can tide over  the  difficult\r\n\r\nsituations until a new day dawns over us, and  from\r\n\r\nthen  onwards,  Mr Speaker, the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhopes to achieve a socialist society which we  have\r\n\r\nall wanted for so long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  first  may I  present  my  personal\r\n\r\ngreetings  to  you?

But I would like\r\n\r\nto   thank  more  than  the  electorate.  I   think\r\n\r\nProvidence must have provided us with eight of  the\r\n\r\nmost  suitable Opposition Assemblymen that we could\r\n\r\npossibly  have  chosen.

But out  of  a\r\n\r\nsense  of fairness to the Opposition, I would  like\r\n\r\nto sketch out the villains of the piece in the next\r\n\r\nfive  years. And may I just have one last  sentence\r\n\r\nin  passing? Even their evil misdeeds in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil will be squatting upon their heads for  the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years, in the person of the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to say quite frankly and honestly\r\n\r\nthat  we are not really concerned with them.  As  a\r\n\r\nforce, a political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforce  representing the bulk or a sizeable  portion\r\n\r\nof  the community, they have ceased to matter. When\r\n\r\nI  say  that, I would like to make an exception  in\r\n\r\nthe case of our three U.M.N.O. friends. I say quite\r\n\r\nfrankly  from  this  side of  the  House,  that  we\r\n\r\nacknowledge   that   they   carry   with   them   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable body of Malay opinion, but not all, As\r\n\r\nfor  the  others,  they are there like  gunny-bags,\r\n\r\nwhich I used to see in Japanese-occupied Singapore,\r\n\r\nstrung across the field for Japanese soldiers to do\r\n\r\nbayonet  practices. Dead ducks, they could  not  be\r\n\r\ndeader!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last four days we have watched their\r\n\r\nperformance  from this side of the  House  and  the\r\n\r\nrole  they have cut for themselves, the poses  that\r\n\r\nthey have struck and the tone that they have set. I\r\n\r\nwould like to sum it up by saying that I have never\r\n\r\nseen  a  more sterile, a more dessicated  group  of\r\n\r\npeople.  More bankrupt a political crowd has  never\r\n\r\ngraced these chairs. They raised three themes.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park is going to be  the  great\r\n\r\ntheoretician for the Opposition. He is the man  who\r\n\r\nis  going to expound to us for the next five  years\r\n\r\nthe  theory  of the democratic system,  or,  as  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Democracy\".  He said we  were  undemocratic\r\n\r\nwhen  we scrapped the City Council because all over\r\n\r\nthe  democratic world, as he understood  it,  local\r\n\r\nGovernment, presumably after that practised in  the\r\n\r\nold Singapore Municipality - subsequently turned City\r\n\r\nCouncil - was  part of democracy. Therefore  when  we\r\n\r\nscrapped  it,  it  was undemocratic.  Then  when  a\r\n\r\nMinister  assumes  powers which  have  always  been\r\n\r\nexercised by those in executive authority, when the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister assumes the powers which were once\r\n\r\nexercised  by  a colonial Financial  Secretary,  he\r\n\r\nsays it is undemocratic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today he spent a considerable time labouring his\r\n\r\npoint about how we should always be on guard to see\r\n\r\nthat  the  rules and regulations of  democracy  are\r\n\r\nobserved.  Sir,  it is the most  important  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  themes that they have raised, and I  propose\r\n\r\nto deal with it last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next theme was the pay cut. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  waxed  eloquent. In fact,  he  waxed  so\r\n\r\neloquent that there was a moment when I was fearful\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  dentures.  But  he  has forgotten  one  simple\r\n\r\nelementary fact. In the trade union world, once you\r\n\r\nare  burnt, you cannot, like the phoenix, rise from\r\n\r\nthe ashes. He burned himself to ashes over the last\r\n\r\nfour  years. His words on the principles  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  and the practice of collective bargaining\r\n\r\nfell  somewhat flat on a trade union movement which\r\n\r\nhad  learned not to regard his Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nand  Welfare  with the esteem and trust  which  our\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour and Law is held by the majority\r\n\r\nof the working class in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third theme was Malay rights. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  are  grateful to the Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  for having moved that amendment  because\r\n\r\nhe  not only exposed himself, but he also helped to\r\n\r\nbring  about one of the most farcical situations  I\r\n\r\nhave ever seen in Singapore politics. Suddenly  the\r\n\r\ngreat progressive from Farrer Park became the great\r\n\r\nsupporter  of communal rights. And the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  a man who appeared with me on  a  radio\r\n\r\nforum  during the election time, who hoped to  make\r\n\r\npolitical   capital  with  the  Chinese  electorate\r\n\r\nbecause  the  P.A.P. stood firm  on  Malay  as  the\r\n\r\nnational  language,  and  who  tried  to  needle  a\r\n\r\nChinese  communal  point  home,  found  himself  in\r\n\r\nexuberant support of Malay rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nplagued  on two occasions by what we term Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurism.  I  now see in this  unprincipled  and\r\n\r\ncompletely shameless switch of political  line  the\r\n\r\nbeginnings  of  the twists and turns of  Right-wing\r\n\r\npolitical adventurism.

Right-wing political adventurers did  to\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance  on the eve of their elections.  Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  read  to our U.M.N.O. friends  across  the\r\n\r\nChamber what his leader had said on communalism and\r\n\r\nthe  future  of Malaya, from a copy of  the  Sunday\r\n\r\nTimes  of  July 19th, dateline Alor Star, Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tengku said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...he was sure Malay political parties, such\r\n\r\nas  Party  Negara and the P.M.I.P.,  would  support\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. if  it chose to contest the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nelection without its M.C.A. and M.I.C. partners.   \r\n\r\nBut  U.M.N.O. being the ruling  political  party,\r\n\r\nhas  realised that in democratic Malaya, it has  to\r\n\r\njoin   hands  with  non-Malay  political   parties,\r\n\r\nparticularly the M.C.A. and M.I.C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and he went on to say-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If they\r\n\r\nwant  the  P.A.P. Government to succeed in carrying\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  mass  with it, in  its  programme  of\r\n\r\nnation  building,  in  which  we  have  made   some\r\n\r\ntremendous   political   gestures   for    national\r\n\r\nsolidarity - such  as  on  questions  of   education,\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  culture - then do not  exasperate  the\r\n\r\nChinese mass by constantly harping on a theme  upon\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government has already stated its  stand\r\n\r\nin clear and categorical terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform the Member for Cairnhill and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park, the new converts  to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  Malay  nationalism,  what  we  said   in\r\n\r\nNovember last year. There is one thing very  simple\r\n\r\nand  easy about the P.A.P. What we believe  we  set\r\n\r\ndown  in  clear and precise terms for all to  read.\r\n\r\nUnlike  our  opponents on the other  side,  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared to put ourselves down in print. I know  of\r\n\r\nno  pamphlet, no manifestos issued by  any  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the other side, because they  have  no\r\n\r\npolitical  credo.  Let  me  just  run  through  the\r\n\r\nstatement  we made on our fourth anniversary  which\r\n\r\nwe  entitled \"The new phase after Merdeka. Our task\r\n\r\nand policy\". And we analysed why there had been  no\r\n\r\nmerger  of  Singapore and the Federation.  We  said\r\n\r\nthat  there were two reasons. First, there are  one\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  in Singapore. Before I read, it,  however,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say that what I am going to read  has  been\r\n\r\nacknowledged by the leader of the U.M.N.O. in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  as  the\r\n\r\ncorrect reason for there being no merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nobody doubts that if the population of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  one  million  Malays  and  150,000\r\n\r\nChinese,  instead  of being the  other  way  round,\r\n\r\nSingapore would have been merged in the Federation,\r\n\r\nWhat  then  is  the problem? It is that  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  in a multi-racial society. The difficulty\r\n\r\nis  especially acute in Malaya because the  Chinese\r\n\r\nare  not  a minority. In the Federation, by itself,\r\n\r\nthe Malays just outnumber the Chinese. If Singapore\r\n\r\nwere  included,  the  Chinese would  outnumber  the\r\n\r\nMalays. It is because the Indians are a minority in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation and Singapore that they present  no\r\n\r\ndifficulties to merger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I read very slowly for the benefit of\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition what we stated  was  the\r\n\r\nfundamental prerequisite to unification of the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It must be demonstrated to three million Malays\r\n\r\nin  the Federation that the one million Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  ready,  willing  and  able  to   be\r\n\r\nabsorbed  as one Malayan people, all able to  speak\r\n\r\nMalay,  and  willing  to  work  together  for   the\r\n\r\neconomic betterment and upliftment of the Malays as\r\n\r\nequals  of  the other races. Malay fears  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  would outnumber and overcome them  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic,  social  and  cultural  fields  of  human\r\n\r\nendeavour must be dispelled. The Malays would  want\r\n\r\nto be satisfied that their language and culture are\r\n\r\nnot  relegated to second place. Hence the paramount\r\n\r\nimportance of settling once and for all what is the\r\n\r\npremier  language of Malaya. It is for  us  in  the\r\n\r\nmainly  Chinese  Singapore to show that  we  accept\r\n\r\nthis  and  welcome  any  step  to  make  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  the  national  language  spoken  by  all.\r\n\r\nCulture is to a large extent the result of language\r\n\r\nand  literature, and the acceptance  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  by  all  as  a  national  language  which\r\n\r\neveryone learns is an important step forward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, no other Party has stated its stand as clearly\r\n\r\nas  the  P.A.P.  I  am not speaking  to  the  Malay\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. leaders opposite, for they do not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  convinced. I am speaking for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  the Federation. The Malays in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  see  from  our deeds and will feel  from  our\r\n\r\npolicies  that  we mean exactly what  we  say.  The\r\n\r\nMalays in the Federation will hear of it from their\r\n\r\nfriends and relatives in Singapore, from the Press,\r\n\r\nfrom the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRadio.  I  hope, if there is nothing else  that  we\r\n\r\nhave achieved in the course of the next five years,\r\n\r\nwe  will  at  least have achieved  one  thing - prove\r\n\r\nconclusively  in a Chinese-dominated city  that  to\r\n\r\nplay the Chinese Chauvinist line is not the way  to\r\n\r\npower,  that  a  Party which carries  with  it  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Chinese can act in a way which fits\r\n\r\ninto  the context and pattern of a Malayan society,\r\n\r\nand not a Chinese society. Unlike the M.C.A. in the\r\n\r\nFederation,  we are a Party rooted in the  mass  of\r\n\r\nthe people; therefore we are in a position not only\r\n\r\nto  make  paper concessions but really to translate\r\n\r\ninto  action what we believe to be fundamentals  in\r\n\r\nthis  task  of  nation-building. We  can  and  will\r\n\r\ntranslate our ideals into practice. We are not like\r\n\r\nthe M.C.A. rebels in the Federation, people who are\r\n\r\njust  floating  on top. To keep mass support,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  beat the big Chauvinist drum. We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  do  that.  Our support  comes  out  of  a\r\n\r\nrealisation  on the part of the Chinese  mass  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  an honest and sincere Party dedicated  to\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  the whole of  the  people,  which\r\n\r\ninclude the Chinese, the Malays and the Indians and\r\n\r\nthe  rest, the vast majority of whom are  the  poor\r\n\r\nand the underprivileged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I dismiss all the foolish things that have\r\n\r\nbeen  said  by the three U.M.N.O. Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  by saying that it will be our pleasure  and\r\n\r\nour  privilege in the course of the next five years\r\n\r\nto  make  the three U.M.N.O. Members eat  back  the\r\n\r\nfoolish  things  they have said on  Malay  communal\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the pay cuts. I want to tell the civil\r\n\r\nservice that the issue at stake is not the loss  of\r\n\r\nallowances or what they have chosen to term as \"the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  negotiations\".  Let  me  tell   them\r\n\r\nplainly  and bluntly that the issue is the survival\r\n\r\nof the English-educated in their attempt to try and\r\n\r\nbridge   this   gap,  the  transition   between   a\r\n\r\nprivileged   class  society  and   an   egalitarian\r\n\r\nsociety.   The   English-educated  are   singularly\r\n\r\nplaced,  by  virtue  of the past  history  of  this\r\n\r\nterritory,  to  play  an  important  role  in  this\r\n\r\ntransition.  They  can help in  bridging  the  gulf\r\n\r\nbetween  a colonial past and an egalitarian future.\r\n\r\nIf they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  issues, I have not  the  slightest\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  many  of  them  will  respond  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenge with which they are faced. Let  me  start\r\n\r\nat the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are bellyaching about is not the\r\n\r\nprinciple of negotiations. The bellyache is the pay\r\n\r\ncut.  If  tomorrow unilaterally, we impose  a  wage\r\n\r\nincrease, I do not believe there is going to  be  a\r\n\r\nhue and cry. It is not over imaginery principles of\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining in trade union practice  that\r\n\r\nthey  are soured with. It is the very real loss  in\r\n\r\ndollars and cents which is going to come at the end\r\n\r\nof July. I want to present them with two arguments.\r\n\r\nFirst to appeal to their better nature; and second,\r\n\r\nto  those who have no better nature, I present them\r\n\r\nwith the awful alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those in the civil service who have better\r\n\r\nnatures, let me say quite frankly that we have  not\r\n\r\ndone  this because we like to do it. Why should  we\r\n\r\nlike  to  hurt and injure people who must work  for\r\n\r\nus?  Part of the democratic system means that there\r\n\r\nis  a  civil service which does the bidding of  the\r\n\r\nParty  that has the mandate of the people.  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained this many a time before, but I  think  it\r\n\r\nbears repeating. The theory of the democratic State\r\n\r\nis   that  there  is  a  good  motor-car  in   good\r\n\r\nmechanical  condition, with mechanics, fitters  and\r\n\r\nso on to keep it sound. And there is a driver there\r\n\r\nto  take the Minister where he wants to go.  It  is\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister having been elected by the people\r\n\r\nto  decide where the driver is to go and how and by\r\n\r\nwhat  route.  It  is  the  business  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice - the  driver, the fitters  and  the  rest - to\r\n\r\nkeep that car in sound mechanical condition. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to punish, incapacitate, antagonise those\r\n\r\nthrough whom we must translate our policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the very time when we were fighting for\r\n\r\nfamily  allowances - my colleagues the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Law,  the Minister  for  Finance,  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker - let  me tell  the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  we were fully aware of the consequences\r\n\r\nif we failed. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncampaign was, as the Minister for Finance said,  to\r\n\r\nbreak  the  will  of the British civil  service  to\r\n\r\ngovern and to assert the will of the local man. And\r\n\r\nthat we did. Not the Member for Farrer Park or  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin. We have not taken the fruits of\r\n\r\ntheir  labour.  The  Member  for  Farrer  Park  was\r\n\r\nlabouring under a delusion that because there  were\r\n\r\nlots of stooges in the City Council of which he was\r\n\r\nnot  one for parliamentary reasons, we are enjoying\r\n\r\nthe benefits of this self-government. Now, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthere  were no people like us to break that system,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park (I went out  just  now,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, to chase up one of the fitters of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  machine.) I remember  having  read\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago of how the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwent  on  a  special training course to Britain  to\r\n\r\ntrain  himself to be the mayor. So I asked  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government fitters in the research  department\r\n\r\nto  dig up this Press cutting. Well, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthey are not as efficient as they ought to be,  but\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  at  the end of  these  five  years,\r\n\r\nbelieve  you  me.  He has not given  me  the  Press\r\n\r\ncutting. He has given me an excerpt and it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Straits Times 3-7-53, A. P. Rajah Progressive\r\n\r\nNorth  making special study in Britain on functions\r\n\r\nof Mayor,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there were long debates about the\r\n\r\nsartorial outfit of the Mayor. The gown, the - may I\r\n\r\nbe  forgiven,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  in  making  this\r\n\r\nreference, but I can assure you that I mean to cast\r\n\r\nno  aspersion  upon the dignity of  your  sartorial\r\n\r\nattire.   I   would  like  to  make   this   point - [Laughter].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First I think members of the\r\n\r\nStrangers' Gallery are getting a bit out  of  hand.\r\n\r\nThey  seem to be laughing too much. Perhaps, it  is\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister who is giving them the lead, But\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether all this reference to the  Mayor\r\n\r\nand  his sartorial garb has anything at all  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  this motion before us; whether there  is  any\r\n\r\nrelevance in it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Indeed! I would like to show\r\n\r\nthat   the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  is   a   man\r\n\r\nrepresentative of that lost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneration,   that  believes  in  the   forms   and\r\n\r\ntrappings of democracy, and is completely oblivious\r\n\r\nto  the fact that the British democratic system - the\r\n\r\nforms  and trappings - undiluted, unamended, is bound\r\n\r\nto perish in South-East Asia. All his time is spent\r\n\r\non  the  outward forms and trappings. It  was  even\r\n\r\ndebated  quite  seriously  whether,  if  the  Mayor\r\n\r\nturned out to be female instead of male, she should\r\n\r\nwear  trousers  or  wear a skirt. Fortunately,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when the time came, the man destined\r\n\r\nto  be Mayor by his Party was unable to contest the\r\n\r\nelections for fear of being routed and the lady who\r\n\r\nhoped to get into trousers disappeared quietly from\r\n\r\nthe  political  scene. The Mayor  whom  the  people\r\n\r\nelected decided, for the good health and benefit of\r\n\r\neveryone,  to put the robes and the chain  and  the\r\n\r\nother  paraphernalia of office in the  place  where\r\n\r\nthey should be - a museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the civil service this. They knew, or\r\n\r\ntheir  leaders knew, what was coming. At  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  we were fighting for these wage increases  we\r\n\r\ndid  not fight for the people at the top. We fought\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  at the bottom.  But  because  the\r\n\r\npeople  at the top would not come unless the carrot\r\n\r\nwas  offered,  they were also offered something  at\r\n\r\nthe  top.  And  may  I say, to the  credit  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law, that throughout  those\r\n\r\ntortuous  negotiations for the final implementation\r\n\r\nof  Ritson, he resisted the demands from  the  top.\r\n\r\nBut,   nevertheless,  because   a   principle   was\r\n\r\ninvolved, parity between the local officer and  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officer, we had to  press  on,  knowing\r\n\r\nfull  well  that the whole thing was unhealthy  and\r\n\r\neconomically unsound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London, the Member for Cairnhill and\r\n\r\nI.  The  Member for Cairnhill, may I say, Sir,  is\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  skilful  political  types  that\r\n\r\nsurvived  a pre-Rendel era into this era.  He  knew\r\n\r\nfull  well  what  the  civil service  wanted.  They\r\n\r\nwanted   to   guarantee   allowances,   basic   and\r\n\r\neverything.  To  freeze it and  make  it  something\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  reach  of  an elected  Government.  He\r\n\r\nagreed with me that it would be iniquitous to foist\r\n\r\non the people of Singapore allowances which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere completely disproportionate to the economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. That was the reason why the Constitution\r\n\r\ncame  to  be  written in the way it did.  The  word\r\n\r\n\"remuneration\" in the definition column in  section\r\n\r\n1 means:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"in respect of any officer means only the\r\n\r\nemoluments of that officer, the whole or  any  part\r\n\r\nof which is pensionable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen what happened in the City Council,\r\n\r\ncertain  members  of the civil  service  wanted  to\r\n\r\nbuild  themselves in. But that did not  take  place\r\n\r\nand  he  was a party to it. He knew full well  that\r\n\r\nthe  proposal was unjust. And now he says \"contrary\r\n\r\nto  trade practice\". The process of rationalisation\r\n\r\nof  the pay scales may take years, that is,  if  we\r\n\r\nare given that time. Let us say quite honestly that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government is a realistic one. When  we\r\n\r\nsay  that we are negotiating, we mean it.  We  have\r\n\r\nimposed  a rule of thumb with an allowance cut.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  in  so  doing, there  will  be  certain\r\n\r\ncategories    of    professional   and    technical\r\n\r\nmen - doctors,  architects, technicians,  maybe  even\r\n\r\nlawyers - who  will find themselves at a disadvantage\r\n\r\nin  respect of their counterparts in the commercial\r\n\r\nworld,  and therefore adjustments will have  to  be\r\n\r\nmade to face the facts. Eventually, it may well  be\r\n\r\nthat  in  certain categories, we may even  have  to\r\n\r\nreward  people  more than even the colonial  system\r\n\r\ndid,  because  we  are going  to  face  up  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic  facts of life. We are not just  going  to\r\n\r\ncarry on a legacy of an expatriate past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state - I mean no aspersion on this officer,\r\n\r\nbut  I  put  it  forward  as  an  instance  of  the\r\n\r\npsychological malady of the civil service: a  local\r\n\r\nofficer  today is staying in a posh local hotel  at\r\n\r\nconsiderable Government subsidy because once upon a\r\n\r\ntime there was a shortage of housing accommodation.\r\n\r\nEuropeans  come  and  go on  leave  and  therefore,\r\n\r\npending  being housed in Government quarters,  they\r\n\r\nsquat in expensive hotels in town and the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  subsidises it. And so it goes  on,  and\r\n\r\nlocal officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho, according to the rules and regulations of  the\r\n\r\ngame, fit the bill also do these things. These  are\r\n\r\nthings  which should not be and cannot be and  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  stop. But that in my  view  is  not\r\n\r\naltogether  their fault. It was because the  system\r\n\r\nallowed  such  things to happen.  Once  the  system\r\n\r\nallowed  civil  servants to spend  their  time  not\r\n\r\nbusying  themselves in the tuning up of the  engine\r\n\r\nin  the car to make it go better and faster, but in\r\n\r\nlooking out for spoils, naturally everybody  joined\r\n\r\nin  the sport. Everybody wanted to get as much  out\r\n\r\nof  the  service as they could, and very  few  were\r\n\r\ninterested in putting into the service as  much  as\r\n\r\nthey could give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are certain good features about the\r\n\r\ncivil  service which we want to preserve. First,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that it is relatively a loyal  service,\r\n\r\nThere  are  the  few  odd ones - the  noisy,  fatuous\r\n\r\ntypes -  whose  folly and stupidity will  ultimately\r\n\r\ncatch  up  with them. But, by and large,  they  are\r\n\r\nloyal to the ideal that the civil service should do\r\n\r\nits  best to carry out and implement the policy  of\r\n\r\nan elected government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they are relatively incorrupt. Looking\r\n\r\naround  South-East Asia, I think we have reason  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate ourselves on the manner in  which  the\r\n\r\nlast elections were carried out, I am told that  in\r\n\r\nThailand,  in the course of an election, bombs  get\r\n\r\nthrown into polling booths, I am told that in  some\r\n\r\nof  the  islands  to  the  east  of  us,  returning\r\n\r\nofficers  helped voters to write out the  names  of\r\n\r\nthe  candidates whom they wanted to  choose.  I  am\r\n\r\ntold  that  in some other parts they put  into  the\r\n\r\nballot  boxes lots of votes for the candidate  they\r\n\r\nwanted to see win before the voting began. I  would\r\n\r\nlike to pay this tribute to our civil service - apart\r\n\r\nfrom  a  few black sheep with whose activities  the\r\n\r\nappropriate Government departments will catch up in\r\n\r\nthe course of time - they are relatively honest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured them of their future, as indeed\r\n\r\nit  is  the business of a Government to ensure  its\r\n\r\ncadres of their future. The Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  do  that.  They guarantee the  livelihood  of\r\n\r\nevery worker of the Government - his life, family and\r\n\r\neducation - as long as the man is alive and  perhaps\r\n\r\neven  after  he  is dead. And for that  reason,  we\r\n\r\nagreed  to  allow the Constitution to  protect  the\r\n\r\npension rights of our civil service. When they join\r\n\r\nthe service, it is necessary for them to know that,\r\n\r\nif   they   devote   their  whole   life   to   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the State, at the end of it  they\r\n\r\ncan  go out to pasture with reasonable comfort. But\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to remind them of this,  that  that\r\n\r\nguarantee   is   only   worth   anything   if   the\r\n\r\nConstitution exists. Where a State is destroyed  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of revolution, the State that succeeds\r\n\r\ndoes not necessarily honour the obligations of  the\r\n\r\nprecedent system. We have a vested interest to  see\r\n\r\nthat this State does not collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to those who have a better nature, I say,\r\n\r\n\"Play  your  part  in the building  up  of  a  more\r\n\r\negalitarian  society.\" History  has  given  them  a\r\n\r\nsingularly  important  role.  By  the  process   of\r\n\r\nelimination  through  Malayanisation,   they   have\r\n\r\nfilled up all the key positions of the apparatus of\r\n\r\nthe State. And it is the business of this State, if\r\n\r\nit  is to survive to bridge the inequalities of the\r\n\r\npast,  to  bring about the order and justice  of  a\r\n\r\nmore equal society of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are only concerned with their\r\n\r\npersonal  interest, I say this:  If  we  lose  this\r\n\r\nbattle, they will also lose. For unless we are able\r\n\r\nto  build  through the processes  of  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem a more equal and just society, then all  the\r\n\r\npensions  and the pastures in the Constitution  are\r\n\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware of what we have inherited. Two\r\n\r\nof the Ministers of this Government were members of\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. We know that we have got a  10-horse power engine to carry a ten-ton load. This is\r\n\r\nthe   real  dilemma  of  this  Government - that  the\r\n\r\nadministration has got just as much as the best  in\r\n\r\nthe  service can put up, and that best, through  no\r\n\r\nfault  of  theirs, is unequal to the demands  which\r\n\r\nour people have made upon the Government. It is our\r\n\r\nbusiness  therefore to try, first,  to  supercharge\r\n\r\nthe engine by adding the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent and skill - both executive and managerial;  by\r\n\r\nimporting, if necessary, expert technical knowledge\r\n\r\nand  know - how. But the long-term objective is  even\r\n\r\nmore  important, that of building up an  engine  of\r\n\r\nmore than 10-horse power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service is now open for competition to\r\n\r\nall  streams  of education - English, Chinese,  Malay\r\n\r\nand  Tamil educated - and we will take from  all  the\r\n\r\nstreams, the best of them all. There is nothing new\r\n\r\nin  this either. We have clearly told them what was\r\n\r\ncoming, and I remember that in Fullerton Square  in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of an election campaign I told  them  of\r\n\r\nthe  future. I said then, and I say now, that  they\r\n\r\nmust  be  prepared  to compete on  equal  terms.  A\r\n\r\nsystem in which because the white man spoke English\r\n\r\nand  therefore he liked best the near white man who\r\n\r\nspoke  English, and after that the  local  man  who\r\n\r\nspoke  English, cannot be sustained in a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the boss has changed. The boss is no  longer\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State for the Colonies. The  boss\r\n\r\ncollectively   are   the  miserable   hawkers   and\r\n\r\nlabourers,   teachers,   clerks - the    people    of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And once we are committed to  one  man,\r\n\r\none  vote, regardless of colour, creed, wealth  and\r\n\r\nknowledge, then we are committed to a more just and\r\n\r\nequal society. I say to the civil service and their\r\n\r\npresent  rather inept leaders who have  begun  what\r\n\r\nthey believe to be a revolutionary movement against\r\n\r\nthe   Government,   that  if  nothing   else   more\r\n\r\ncatastrophic  happens  to them  than  the  loss  of\r\n\r\nallowances  in  the  top  brackets  of  the   civil\r\n\r\nservice,  and  the  fact that  they  have  to  face\r\n\r\nfiercer  competition from the non-English  educated\r\n\r\nmembers of the service, then they should go down on\r\n\r\ntheir  bended knees and thank the gods  that  their\r\n\r\nsouls have been spared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the third theme - democracy as\r\n\r\nexpounded by the Member for Farrer Park. I want  to\r\n\r\npreface my remarks with this reminder of the  past,\r\n\r\nthat the English educated, because their avenue  of\r\n\r\ninformation has been confined to the English Press,\r\n\r\nhave been unable to face up to the real issues that\r\n\r\nthe  country is faced with. The English  Press  has\r\n\r\nplayed a diabolical role\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the last few years. They believe that the march\r\n\r\nof  time  can  be stopped by scaring  the  English-educated. Nobody really seriously believed that  my\r\n\r\nMinisters and I were a gang of lunatics.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nafter  we won, they took scrupulous pains  to  list\r\n\r\nall  the  virtues that we possess, and  which  they\r\n\r\nalready   knew   a   long  time   ago.   But   they\r\n\r\nsystematically  distorted  and  misrepresented  the\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people who are prepared to face the\r\n\r\nfacts  are  the  people in the  leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  We  pursued  our line not  for  reasons  of\r\n\r\npolitical  opportunism but because we  believed  it\r\n\r\nwas  the only way, the only sensible and sane  way,\r\n\r\nto prevent all that was good in the past from being\r\n\r\ndestroyed by all that was bad in the past. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say that this is a government  with  long\r\n\r\nmemories.   We   do  not  pursue   petty   personal\r\n\r\nvendettas, but what we say as a matter of policy we\r\n\r\nstand by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first task, so far as the English-educated\r\n\r\nare  concerned, is to pose the issues  to  them  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  see the stark realities  of  this\r\n\r\nsituation.  And  I say to the civil  servants  that\r\n\r\nwhat  is at stake is not just their pay allowances,\r\n\r\nthe   principle   of  collective   bargaining   and\r\n\r\nnegotiation, or their pensions but what is at stake\r\n\r\nis  the  survival of the democratic State. And  the\r\n\r\nproblem  arises  in this way. As a  result  of  the\r\n\r\naberrations of past colonial governments, masses of\r\n\r\npeople  were allowed to come into this  country  to\r\n\r\nhelp  provide cheap labour, to exploit the national\r\n\r\nresources.   All   the   immigrants   fended    for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and it is a credit to them  that  they\r\n\r\ndid  it  so  wonderfully. They provided  their  own\r\n\r\nschools.   They  provided  their  own  systems   of\r\n\r\neducation  and upbringing. And they provided  their\r\n\r\noffspring  with  a complete set of cultural  values\r\n\r\nwhich  they  thought proper. And the misfortune  we\r\n\r\nare  faced with now is that there are broadly  four\r\n\r\nlarge linguistic and cultural groups with different\r\n\r\nsets of values. If it was a question of one man one\r\n\r\nvote in the early days where only the English\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducated  voted, this problem would not arise.  The\r\n\r\nproblem arises in an acute form when all the  other\r\n\r\nlanguage-groups  vote.  As  far   as   Malaya   and\r\n\r\nSingapore are concerned, the bulk of the population\r\n\r\nare  either Chinese or Malay educated, and the bulk\r\n\r\nof  the  present leadership of both the  Federation\r\n\r\nand Singapore are English educated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I assure the Member for Farrer Park, two\r\n\r\nMinisters of the Government side studied  and  took\r\n\r\nexaminations in Constitutional Law and Practice the\r\n\r\nRule  of  Law,  and both passed their examinations.\r\n\r\nSix  of  the  nine Ministers spent  part  of  their\r\n\r\neducation   in  colleges  abroad,  and  are   quite\r\n\r\nfamiliar   and  conversant  with  the   rules   and\r\n\r\nprinciples, and the trappings and the forms of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system.  But  all  the  Ministers   and\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.  English-educated,  Chinese  educated,\r\n\r\nMalay  educated,  Tamil  educated,  understand  one\r\n\r\nfundamental  rule, and that is, if a thing  is  not\r\n\r\nmade  suitable  for  the  people,  that  thing   is\r\n\r\nuseless. And I put the issue as simply and  plainly\r\n\r\nas  this: that the mass of the Chinese educated and\r\n\r\nthe  Malay educated and the Tamil educated and even\r\n\r\nthe  English  educated in this country  have  never\r\n\r\nread  Dicey  on  the  Rule  of  Law,  or  Wade  and\r\n\r\nPhillips,  and have never heard about  Hansard.  If\r\n\r\nthey  decide that the democratic system which  they\r\n\r\nhear has come into being after independence in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   and   internal   self-government    in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  does not make any difference  to  their\r\n\r\nlives,  if  it  only perpetuates the  follies,  the\r\n\r\nstupidities,  the inequalities, and the  injustices\r\n\r\nof  the  past,  then at the end of five  years,  or\r\n\r\nmaybe ten years, we have only ourselves to blame if\r\n\r\nthey decide that this system is unsuitable. And  if\r\n\r\nwe  try  to  pay  attention to  forms  and  not  to\r\n\r\nsubstance, then surely we will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reduce to its barest essentials what we on\r\n\r\nthis side of the House believe to be the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  It  means a system where each man  has  as\r\n\r\nmuch a right to live in this world as the next man,\r\n\r\nand where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  possible for the majority of the people  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  changes in the social  order  without\r\n\r\nresort  to force. Translated into political  terms,\r\n\r\nit  means giving one man one vote, and allowing him\r\n\r\nto  decide  who should govern, and how they  should\r\n\r\ngovern  for a specified number of years.  It  means\r\n\r\nthe  right  at the end of that specified number  of\r\n\r\nyears again to pass judgment on that government and\r\n\r\non  others  who  may  present  themselves  for  the\r\n\r\nmandate of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Member for Farrer Park that there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  which  this Government  does  that  is\r\n\r\nundemocratic if it is within the framework of  this\r\n\r\nConstitution,  and that is, on the hypothesis  that\r\n\r\nthis  Constitution is democratic; and  I  have  not\r\n\r\nheard any of the Members on the other side say that\r\n\r\nthis Constitution is not democratic, let alone  the\r\n\r\nold  Progressive  Party loyalist,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, But despite all the democratic  forms\r\n\r\nand   procedures   and  the   spirit   which   this\r\n\r\nConstitution   tries  to  provide  for   democracy,\r\n\r\nfundamentally  it is not a democratic Constitution:\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is an over-riding  provision  which\r\n\r\ngives  the  British raj the right to revoke  it.  I\r\n\r\nhave  not heard the Member for Farrer Park complain\r\n\r\nagainst  this.  At the bottom of his  heart  he  is\r\n\r\nthinking that if anything goes wrong, well, what to\r\n\r\ndo.  He will be rescued by the British raj.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot  complaining about this. That is the reason why\r\n\r\nI  say  this: in his preoccupation with forms,  the\r\n\r\noutward  manifestations, the robes and  regalia  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, the rules and by-laws, he has  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe  fundamentals, and that is,  the  will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of the majority shall prevail, on how  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  governed and by whom. And  at  periodic\r\n\r\nintervals  they  will  re-assert  their  right   to\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Members opposite quite frankly that if\r\n\r\nyou  try  to  run the undiluted, the British-styled\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  in  the context  of  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia, you will collapse. It is not possible. I have\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheard the Member for Farrer Park nor the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  say  that  the  Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance is undemocratic.  According  to\r\n\r\nthe   book   of   rules   of   the   British   type\r\n\r\nConstitutions, it is undemocratic. But if  you  pay\r\n\r\njust lip-service to little by-rules, the frills  of\r\n\r\na  democratic  state, then you have  no  chance  of\r\n\r\nsurvival.  You  must try to translate  into  actual\r\n\r\nreality the basic objectives of a democratic system\r\n\r\nwithin the conditions which exist in Singapore,  in\r\n\r\nMalaya, in the milieu of South-East Asia in revolt.\r\n\r\nIn  the whole history of South-East Asia, there has\r\n\r\nnever  been an epoch where there is so much ferment\r\n\r\nand  turmoil as has taken place since 1945-a  whole\r\n\r\nsystem of society crushed and crumpled up. Many  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours have yet to find the final form  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they will be governed. Let me read this  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the Member for Farrer  Park.  I  am\r\n\r\nreading now from a very sober Sunday newspaper, The\r\n\r\nObserver  of  London, from their  correspondent  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia; 14th June, 1959, page 9, where  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">\"The Lights Are All Going Out All Over Asia</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who believe that political salvation\r\n\r\nlies   only  in  political  democracy  as   it   is\r\n\r\nunderstood in the West, the lights of Asia are  one\r\n\r\nby  one waning and going out. Military leaders have\r\n\r\ntaken  effective power off the hands of politicians\r\n\r\nin  Pakistan, Thailand and Burma. Indonesia  is  on\r\n\r\nthe  brink of a constitutional revolution  designed\r\n\r\nto  give  President Soekarno and the Army the  real\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   national  affairs.   In   Laos   the\r\n\r\nConservative  Prime  Minister  now  enjoys  special\r\n\r\npowers  which  reduce Parliament to a  cypher.  The\r\n\r\ngeneral elections which are due to be held in three\r\n\r\ndifferent  countries of South-East Asia  this  year\r\n\r\nhave been postponed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let me read out another passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"After the war nationalist movements gain\r\n\r\nmomentum  and  the  Asian  countries  won  or  were\r\n\r\ngranted their independence, but the humiliation did\r\n\r\nnot   end   there,  Their  new,  often  jerry-built\r\n\r\nimitations  of Western democratic systems  were  in\r\n\r\ntoo   many   cases   exploited   by   opportunistic\r\n\r\npoliticians, wrecked by bureaucratic boneheads  and\r\n\r\nplundered by the pocket-lines. Economies  ran  down\r\n\r\nthe  hill,  corruption  and  inefficiency  poisoned\r\n\r\nnational administrations, and the result is chaos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  say  without any hesitation that if we  have  to\r\n\r\nmake  variations and adaptations to the  forms  and\r\n\r\ntrappings and the frills of a democratic system, we\r\n\r\nshall  do  so, because the business of a government\r\n\r\nis  to  govern and we have the mandate  to  govern.\r\n\r\nWhat  is more, we had the courage to put down  what\r\n\r\nwe  intended to do and had a clear mandate  on  it,\r\n\r\nunlike Members on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we preoccupy ourselves with forms and\r\n\r\nprocedures  then  we shall all be wasting  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of time in the next five years, because  some\r\n\r\nof  the forms and procedures which may have  to  be\r\n\r\nfollowed  may  not be in accordance with  the  best\r\n\r\ntraditions of Westminster or the British Government\r\n\r\nat  Whitehall. But I give you this assurance.  That\r\n\r\nthis  is a Government which is fully aware  of  the\r\n\r\nessentials of a democratic state, which it believes\r\n\r\nare  worth  preserving, and at  the  same  time  is\r\n\r\nsufficiently knowledgeable of the realities of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  to try and make the system work  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  South-East  Asia.  I  would  tell  the\r\n\r\nMembers opposite this - more important than the  dead\r\n\r\nletters of a Constitution are the actors who  bring\r\n\r\nit  to life, If you have Mr Mak Pak Shee trying to\r\n\r\nplay Hamlet, or worse, Chew Swee Kee trying to play\r\n\r\nShylock, then even Shakespeare becomes a farce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, your system is as good as the best men\r\n\r\nwho  operate it. And let us never forget that.  For\r\n\r\nover  thirty years, the only political  Party  that\r\n\r\nconstantly organised to get the best actors on  its\r\n\r\nside  was  the Communist Party of Malaya. And  they\r\n\r\nrecruited and trained them. The nationalist Parties\r\n\r\ndid  not emerge until 1945. If you want to play the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  drama, then you must have the  dramatis\r\n\r\npersonae  to  make  it worthy of listening  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  whom  you are presenting  it.  That  is\r\n\r\nreally the crux of the problem. I say, without  the\r\n\r\nslightest  immodesty on the part of  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nand myself, that we are the only group that has the\r\n\r\ncoherence,  drive and the convictions to  build  up\r\n\r\nsomething more than ourselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-a   democratic,   socialist  movement   within   a\r\n\r\nrevolutionary situation. The issue is as simple  as\r\n\r\nthis.  If we do not continue recruiting as we  have\r\n\r\ndone   in  the  past  five  years,  then  we  shall\r\n\r\neventually wither and die, It is only if we recruit\r\n\r\nand  we grow in strength within the next five years\r\n\r\nthat  we can face the world at the end of it,  with\r\n\r\nthe  aplomb  and assurance as befits a Party  which\r\n\r\nhas  dedicated itself to the interests of the  mass\r\n\r\nof  its  people.  And you can only recruit  if  you\r\n\r\nconvince those whom you intend to recruit that  you\r\n\r\nare recruiting for a worthwhile cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me draw one lesson for the Members on the\r\n\r\nother  side.  There is not one single  Member - apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  U.M.N.O. Members who are representing  a\r\n\r\nportion  of  the  Malay  people - who  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople. They represent a group which is spent, lost\r\n\r\nand  exhausted.  Why  have  they  got  no  Chinese-educated  with  them? Because they  are  unable  in\r\n\r\ntheir  preoccupation with mayoral robes, rules  and\r\n\r\nprocedures,  to  bring home the  message  that  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system can work in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people, if there are men and  women\r\n\r\nof  integrity, honesty, drive and purpose  to  make\r\n\r\nthe system work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Member for Tanglin this - that going to\r\n\r\nSunday school once a week to preach is no good.  Go\r\n\r\ndown  and work for the people every day of the week\r\n\r\nif you want to bring home to them the fact that the\r\n\r\nelected  representatives are  worth  electing,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  system that elected representatives  are\r\n\r\nworking is worth the keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the power of the State which we now control is\r\n\r\nused  not to enrich the lives of many of its people\r\n\r\nbut  to  line  the pockets of a few of  the  ruling\r\n\r\nhierarchy, then verily we shall all perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government had put its  cards  on  the\r\n\r\ntable  before  it assumed office. We  did  it  over\r\n\r\nthree  months  of  campaigning beginning  from  the\r\n\r\nfamous  day  of 15th February at Hong Lim.  It  was\r\n\r\nthere the Deputy Prime Minister said things and set\r\n\r\noff  a chain reaction which finally ended with  the\r\n\r\nrouting of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrogues  and  scallywags that  used  to  haunt  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  We  have  placed before  the  people  the\r\n\r\nmandate that we sought of them. We did not  try  to\r\n\r\ndeceive anyone. We know exactly what is expected of\r\n\r\nus  because we have made these promises. Unlike the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government,  we  gave  no  hostages   to\r\n\r\nfortune.  Plainly  and simply, we  took  the  stand\r\n\r\nwhich we knew was necessary and in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of  the democratic state  in  order,\r\n\r\nfirst,  to cleanse the system of the evils  of  the\r\n\r\npast,  and to retrieve some of the liberalism,  the\r\n\r\ntolerance  which  were the good  things  we  should\r\n\r\ncarry into the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell the Opposition this. They provide us, and\r\n\r\nI hope they will continue to provide us in the next\r\n\r\nfive  years,  with that vivid contrast  which  will\r\n\r\nthrow   up   the   virtues  of  the   P.A.P. into\r\n\r\nmagnificence. But if we fail, let me tell them that\r\n\r\nthis is not a constitutional position of Tweedledum\r\n\r\nand   Tweedledee,  Democrats  and  Republicans   in\r\n\r\nAmerica,  or  Tories and Labour in Britain.  If  we\r\n\r\nfail, and we are unable to make the system work, it\r\n\r\nis  not they who are going to come back. They  will\r\n\r\nbe fleeing for their lives, because behind us there\r\n\r\nis  no other alternative which is prepared to  work\r\n\r\nthe  democratic system. And therefore, in the  last\r\n\r\nanalysis, if we fail then brute force returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure no one in this House nor any one in the\r\n\r\ncountry would want this to happen. And therefore, I\r\n\r\nsay  to all those who wish us ill, that if we fail,\r\n\r\nwoe  betide them. But to those who wish us well,  I\r\n\r\ngive  this message. This is a Government consisting\r\n\r\nof people who put their ideas, their ideals and the\r\n\r\nwelfare of their people above themselves, This is a\r\n\r\nParty  which  has  the courage of its  convictions,\r\n\r\nwhich is prepared to pursue what it believes to  be\r\n\r\nright   in  the  interest  of  the  people  without\r\n\r\ndeviating for opportunist reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be an era which will light up the dark\r\n\r\npages of the history of Singapore, post 1945. If we\r\n\r\nsucceed, as we intend to, in building a climate not\r\n\r\nonly  of national solidarity but a climate in which\r\n\r\nthe   ordinary   people  begin  to   believe   that\r\n\r\ninstitutions of Government in the country  are  run\r\n\r\nby people who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloved and revered because they are working for  the\r\n\r\nmass  of  the  people, then we  will  have  done  a\r\n\r\nservice, not only to ourselves, our Party  and  our\r\n\r\nmovement,  but we will also have done a service  to\r\n\r\nthe democratic socialist movement. Until the advent\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. no group proclaiming the democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  cause ever struck roots in the  mass  of\r\n\r\nthe people. Let me say, Mr Speaker, Sir, judge  us\r\n\r\nnot  in the next five years by the standards of the\r\n\r\nBritish House of Commons and the British Government\r\n\r\nin  Whitehall. Judge our performance in the context\r\n\r\nof   our  objectives  and  the  realities  of   our\r\n\r\nsituation,  and at the end of five years  you  will\r\n\r\ncertainly not find us wanting in courage, in skill,\r\n\r\nand in sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Toh, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.
