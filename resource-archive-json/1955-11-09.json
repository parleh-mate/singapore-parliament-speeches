Members\r\n\r\nsince Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time a Sessional Paper (Command No.\r\n\r\n28  of  1955)  was circulated. This paper  gives  a\r\n\r\nbrief description of the Draft Estimates of Revenue\r\n\r\nand  Expenditure and it is hoped that it may  serve\r\n\r\nas  a  guide to hon. Members in their consideration\r\n\r\nof the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I deal with the Draft Estimates in detail,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  will  perhaps  wish  me  to  comment\r\n\r\nbriefly  on  the  workings for 1954,  the  possible\r\n\r\noutturn  for  1955  and on the  financial  position\r\n\r\ngenerally. These matters are covered in some detail\r\n\r\nin the Sessional Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounts for 1954 show a deficit of $41.6\r\n\r\nmillions. Revenue realised $207 millions instead of\r\n\r\nthe  estimate of $214 millions, due mainly  to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the collections of income tax fell $13.5\r\n\r\nmillions   below  the  estimate  of  $70  millions.\r\n\r\nExpenditure amounted to $248 millions as against an\r\n\r\nestimate  of  $240.5 millions.  This  included  two\r\n\r\nlarge  items  of  special expenditure  which  were\r\n\r\nunforeseen  when the estimates were  prepared.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  was  for  $36.4 millions in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nsettlement  of the Straits Settlements Assets  and\r\n\r\nLiabilities. The second was for $14.5  millions  in\r\n\r\nrespect of a payment on account of the purchase  of\r\n\r\nthe Oriental Telephone and Electric Company. If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  large items are left out of account,  normal\r\n\r\nexpenditure  amounts to $197.9  millions  of  which\r\n\r\n$14.5  millions represents expenditure under Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Non-Recurrent and a notional surplus  of  $9\r\n\r\nmillions can be shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to 1955, it appears likely that there\r\n\r\nwill  again be a surplus but this time of  only  $2\r\n\r\nmillions.  Revenue is likely to fall short  of  the\r\n\r\nestimate of $208 millions by $7 millions. It is now\r\n\r\nclear  that collections from income tax  were  over\r\n\r\nestimated at $70 millions. It is unlikely that more\r\n\r\nthan  $56  millions will be collected. 1954  was  a\r\n\r\nmuch   less   prosperous  year,  particularly   for\r\n\r\ncompanies, than was thought when the Estimates were\r\n\r\ndrafted. This shortfall will be offset to a certain\r\n\r\nextent  by  increased collection on Customs  Duties\r\n\r\nand  other items of revenue, but the net collection\r\n\r\nof revenue is unlikely to exceed $201 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also appears likely that expenditure will also\r\n\r\nfall  considerably short of the  estimate.  On  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of actual expenditure to the end of  August,\r\n\r\nit  appears that total expenditure will  amount  to\r\n\r\nabout  $199  millions, including a contribution  of\r\n\r\n$20  millions to development expenditure. The  main\r\n\r\nsavings on estimated expenditure have been effected\r\n\r\nunder  Head:  Defence  Services.  There  has   been\r\n\r\nunavoidable  delay in the construction  of  seaward\r\n\r\ndefence  vessels and inshore minesweepers  for  the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Malayan  Navy, in addition to other  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  works, and savings  of  over  $18\r\n\r\nmillions   are  expected  under  this  Head.   This\r\n\r\nexpenditure will, of course, be carried forward  to\r\n\r\nfuture  years. Savings of about $2.5  millions  are\r\n\r\nexpected under Head: Education as well as Head:  Medical and Health, and\r\n\r\nover  $1  million in the case of Public  Works  and\r\n\r\nPostal  Services, due mainly to inability  to  fill\r\n\r\nappointment and to savings on Special Expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small surplus of $2 millions expected in 1955\r\n\r\ncompares  with surpluses of $42 millions  in  1952,\r\n\r\n$52  millions in 1953 and, as already explained,  a\r\n\r\nsurplus on normal working of $9 millions in 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also appears probable that development\r\n\r\nexpenditure   will  fall  short  of  the   original\r\n\r\nestimate of $60.5 millions by some $16 millions and\r\n\r\nthat  a  balance of about $30 millions, instead  of\r\n\r\n$16.4  millions,  will remain  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nReserve  Fund  for  use in 1956.  Under-expenditure\r\n\r\nhas,  in  the  main,  been due to  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nobtaining and clearing sites and to delays  in  the\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  essential material.  In  addition,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $10 millions will have been advanced  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust by the end of 1955\r\n\r\nfor  the  construction of low  cost  housing.  Here\r\n\r\nagain, the efforts of the Trust have been seriously\r\n\r\nfrustrated  by difficulties in clearing  sites  for\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the Estimated Assets and\r\n\r\nLiabilities on 1st January, 1956, is given on pages 6\r\n\r\nand  7  of  the  volume  of draft  estimates.  This\r\n\r\nstatement  is  discussed  in  some  detail  in  the\r\n\r\nSessional Paper. Perhaps the main point to note  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Special Reserve Fund which, with interest\r\n\r\nadded,  stood  at  $106.6  millions  in  the   last\r\n\r\nStatement,  has now been revalued at $96  millions,\r\n\r\ndue  to the general fall in value of the gilt-edged\r\n\r\nsecurities in which it is invested. The Development\r\n\r\nReserve  Fund,  to  which interest  has  also  been\r\n\r\nadded, has been reduced from $51.9 millions to  $30\r\n\r\nmillions   by   drawings   for   development    and\r\n\r\nrevaluation, although in this case, since the  Fund\r\n\r\nis  invested in short-term securities, the fall  in\r\n\r\nvalue has been less marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the position of the Colony's finances\r\n\r\nas  they  will  stand at the end of  1955  must  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as sound. The public debt is  very  small\r\n\r\nand  adequate  provision continues to  be  made  to\r\n\r\nservice  it. There is a solid Special Reserve  Fund\r\n\r\nwhich  serves  as the sheet anchor of the  Colony's\r\n\r\nfinances  and  which  can only  be  drawn  upon  by\r\n\r\nresolution  of  the Assembly. There  is  a  General\r\n\r\nRevenue Balance of $130 millions. Attention  should\r\n\r\nhowever  be drawn to two points. The first is  that\r\n\r\napproximately $109 millions of the General  Revenue\r\n\r\nBalance is bound up in long-term loans, the bulk of\r\n\r\nwhich  are  repayable on an annuity  basis  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of 60 years. Therefore, of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral  Revenue  Balance, only  a  small  part  is\r\n\r\nliquid and available for use in the near future. In\r\n\r\nfact,  a  truer  picture of the financial  position\r\n\r\nmight  be  shown  if these loans  were  charged  to\r\n\r\nexpenditure and the repayments credited to  revenue\r\n\r\nyear   by   year.   This  matter   is   now   under\r\n\r\nconsideration.  The  second  is  that,  while   the\r\n\r\nposition at present is sound, we are about to enter\r\n\r\ninto  a  period when mounting recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nand  the  needs  of  development,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  housing and the social services,  will\r\n\r\nmake great demands on our resources. It is when  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  Estimates for 1956 and the  probable\r\n\r\nposition  in later years that we see the  financial\r\n\r\nposition of the Colony in its true perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Draft Estimates of Revenue are described in\r\n\r\nsome  detail in the Sessional Paper. The  estimates\r\n\r\ntotal $208.4 millions and represent as accurate  an\r\n\r\nestimate  as it is possible to give of the  revenue\r\n\r\nwhich is likely to accrue in 1956, on the basis  of\r\n\r\nexisting  taxation.  Generally,  they  follow  very\r\n\r\nclosely on the pattern of previous years. The  fact\r\n\r\nthat 1955 has generally been a more prosperous year\r\n\r\nthan  1954 for commercial interests has been  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account in estimating income tax  collections\r\n\r\nat $65 millions, compared with actual collection of\r\n\r\n$56  millions in 1954 and estimated collections  of\r\n\r\n$57  millions  in  1955. In estimating  collections\r\n\r\nfrom Customs Duties, account has been taken on  the\r\n\r\none  hand  of  the  fact  that  the  effects  of  a\r\n\r\nFederation  boom  are usually delayed  in  reaching\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and,  on the other,  that  the  present\r\n\r\nprice  of  rubber  may not be maintained  in  1956.\r\n\r\nCustoms Duties of all kinds total over $73 millions\r\n\r\nand  represent approximately one-third of the total\r\n\r\nrevenue.  Other items of revenue vary  little  from\r\n\r\nthe estimates of previous years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on the Draft Estimates of\r\n\r\nExpenditure,  I  should like to draw  attention  to\r\n\r\ncertain changes in the format of the Estimates. New\r\n\r\nHeads  of  expenditure have been  created  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries.  The  various  departments  in\r\n\r\nMinisterial   portfolios  have  been   grouped   in\r\n\r\nalphabetical order after the Ministry  Head.  Head: Mis-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncellaneous Services, which totalled $30 millions in\r\n\r\n1955,   has   been  abolished,  and   the   services\r\n\r\npreviously  grouped  under  this  Head  have  been\r\n\r\ntransferred to other appropriate Heads.  This  fact\r\n\r\nshould  be  borne in mind when what  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nextraordinary  increases in expenditure  are  noted\r\n\r\nunder  other  Heads.  The  divisions  of  the   old\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Commerce  and  Industry  have  been\r\n\r\nreconstituted as independent departments under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates of expenditure total $231 millions,\r\n\r\nincluding   a  contribution  of  $20  millions   to\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The first draft estimates submitted by\r\n\r\ndepartments,   excluding   any   contribution    to\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  totalled  $232  millions.  They  were\r\n\r\nsubsequently  pruned  to $211 millions.  In  making\r\n\r\nthese  reductions, the following objects were  kept\r\n\r\nclearly   in  mind:  the  need  to  limit  ordinary\r\n\r\ndepartmental recurrent expenditure to  the  minimum\r\n\r\nrequired  for the efficient discharge of Government\r\n\r\nbusiness:  the need to make adequate provision  for\r\n\r\nthe  expansion of the social services: and the need\r\n\r\nto  augment  the funds likely to be  available  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  by  a  substantial  contribution  from\r\n\r\nrevenue.  Action towards these ends  was  taken  as\r\n\r\nfollows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of ordinary departments all\r\n\r\napplications for new appointments were re-examined.\r\n\r\nOnly  those  were passed for entry which  could  be\r\n\r\nshown  to  be  necessary for  the  expansion  of  a\r\n\r\nservice  for the public, e.g. postmen; or  for  the\r\n\r\nmanning of a service which had been provided  in  a\r\n\r\nprevious year, e.g. crew for a new launch; or which\r\n\r\ncould  be  shown  directly to save  expenditure  or\r\n\r\nincrease revenue, e.g. collection of income tax; or\r\n\r\nwhich  were otherwise imperative for the  efficient\r\n\r\ndischarge  of the government business. With  regard\r\n\r\nto  recurrent expenditure, in so far  as  this  was\r\n\r\npossible, provision was limited to, if not  reduced\r\n\r\nbelow, the 1955 Estimates. As will be seen from  an\r\n\r\nexamination of the volume of the estimates, special\r\n\r\nexpenditure has been cut to the bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the social service departments\r\n\r\nthe needs arising from the rapid expansion of these\r\n\r\nservices  were appreciated. The ordinary  estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  Medical Department are,  in  total,  $1.4\r\n\r\nmillions   in  excess  of  the  1955  figure.   The\r\n\r\nestimates for the Department of Education,  if  one\r\n\r\ntakes account of increased provision for grants  in\r\n\r\naid   and   the  contribution  to  the   University\r\n\r\ntransferred from Head: Miscellaneous Services,  are\r\n\r\nalso very close to the 1955 figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the net result was that the\r\n\r\nestimates  of  expenditure  were  reduced  to  $211\r\n\r\nmillions and it was possible to make provision  for\r\n\r\na  contribution  of  $20 millions  for  development\r\n\r\nwhich   was   required  if  essential   development\r\n\r\nprojects were to be financed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with the ordinary estimates of\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the Sessional Paper under  the  main\r\n\r\ndivisions  of  Personal Emoluments,  Other  Charges\r\n\r\nAnnually Recurrent and Special Expenditure, and  it\r\n\r\nmight be appropriate if I now deal with them on a departmental basis, drawing attention to points  of interest on that basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A table showing the pattern of estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  given on page 7 of  the  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper.  Further details of departmental expenditure\r\n\r\non  a  percentage basis are given in Appendix A  of\r\n\r\nthe  volume  of the Estimates. The main  points  of\r\n\r\ninterest  arising from that table  are  the  steady\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  expenditure on the social services  and\r\n\r\nthe marked rise in respect of education in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the various Heads of Expenditure, the\r\n\r\nnew Ministries require approximately $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 2: Pensions, increased provision is\r\n\r\nrequired for pensions generally and for commutation\r\n\r\nof  pensions.  These increases alone make  up  over\r\n\r\n$700,000 of the total increase of $1 million  under\r\n\r\nthis Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision made under Head 3: Charitable\r\n\r\nAllowances, follows the usual lines. The  provision\r\n\r\nfor  Family Planning has been increased by  $25,000\r\n\r\nand  I am asked to state that this item will be the\r\n\r\nsubject  of a free vote in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n$300,000 has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   provided  as  a  contribution  towards the\r\n\r\ncapital  cost  of  a  new  hospital  building   for\r\n\r\nS.A.T.A.  Under  the Social Welfare  sub-head,  the\r\n\r\ncontributions    to    S.A.T.A. and    voluntary\r\n\r\ninstitutions for children have been increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Head 6: Legislature, I understand\r\n\r\nthat  certain additions to this Head will be  moved\r\n\r\nin  Committee,  arising  from  increases  of  staff\r\n\r\napproved by the Standing Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 10: Audit, provision has been made for\r\n\r\ncertain  new appointments but the cost of these  is\r\n\r\nlargely covered by increased audit fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated Expenditure under Head 12: Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary has increased from $2 millions in 1955 to\r\n\r\n$5.7  millions  in 1956. The increases,  which  are\r\n\r\nalmost  entirely  due to services transferred  from\r\n\r\nold  Head: Miscellaneous Services, are explained  on\r\n\r\npages 4. 5 and 6 of the Sessional Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 14: Chemistry, provision has been made\r\n\r\nfor   the  first  time  for  the  Inspectorate   of\r\n\r\nDangerous Materials, an essential service in a city\r\n\r\nlike Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision under Head 16: Defence Services,\r\n\r\nhas  been very substantially reduced by eliminating\r\n\r\nfrom the estimates all provision, which is unlikely\r\n\r\nto be spent in 1956. The planned development of the\r\n\r\nDefence   Services  has,  of  course,   not   been\r\n\r\ninterfered with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 18: Botanic Gardens, provision has\r\n\r\nbeen made for the first time for a Nature Reserves\r\n\r\nsub-department  which  will  give  effect  to   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police Personal Emoluments have increased by\r\n\r\n$900,000.  69  new  appointments  appear   in   the\r\n\r\nestimates  of  which  20 were approved  last  year.\r\n\r\nOther  Charges  Annually Recurrent expenditure  has\r\n\r\nbeen  kept  within  the  1955  figure,  despite   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase in the cost of City  Services\r\n\r\nand  provision  for contributions  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident   Fund.  Special  Expenditure   is   only\r\n\r\nslightly in excess of the Estimate for 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made under Head 27: Treasury, for\r\n\r\nthe contribution of $20 millions to development. It\r\n\r\nmay be argued that such contributions should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  be made from revenue, that capital expenditure\r\n\r\nshould  be  met from loans, and that the burden  of\r\n\r\nrepayment should be shared by all who will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  it.  The answer to this argument is that  the\r\n\r\nmoney  is required not only for capital development\r\n\r\nin  the  ordinary sense of the term  but  also  for\r\n\r\nspecial  development expenditure, as will  be  seen\r\n\r\nfrom  the  estimate; that when it  is  for  capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the ordinary sense, it is  required\r\n\r\nto  build  schools and hospitals  for  the  present\r\n\r\ngeneration;  that future generations will  probably\r\n\r\nhave  to bear an even greater burden, and that  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment requirements are such that we will have\r\n\r\ndifficulty in meeting them, not because our  credit\r\n\r\nis  in doubt but because the capacity of the  loan\r\n\r\nmarket  is limited. Contributions from revenue  are\r\n\r\ntherefore required as long as we can afford to make\r\n\r\nthem.   Provision  is  also  made  for  the   first\r\n\r\nrepayment  instalment of the  War  Damage  Interest\r\n\r\nFree Loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 31: Income Tax, provision is made for\r\n\r\nadditional  staff  in connection with  the  planned\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  the  department, and  under  Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure   for   increased   staff    for    the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of tax evasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 45: Land and District Offices,\r\n\r\nprovision is made for the new Land Titles Registry.\r\n\r\nA  sum  of $796,900 is revoted for the acquisition,\r\n\r\ndrainage   and   development  of  land   for   food\r\n\r\nproduction. Of particular note is the fact that  no\r\n\r\ncontribution is made to the Rural Board in  respect\r\n\r\nof  Other Charges Annually Recurrent expenditure in\r\n\r\n1956,  the  Board having increased its  revenue  by\r\n\r\n$900,000. This is a most gratifying move  on  which\r\n\r\nthe  Board  is  to be heartily congratulated.  Last\r\n\r\nyear's contribution in this respect was $405,000. A\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  $632,000 is  made  under  Special\r\n\r\nExpenditure, compared with $1.3 millions  in  1955.\r\n\r\nOf this sum, $254,000 is revoted. In addition, $4.4\r\n\r\nmillions is provided for development compared  with\r\n\r\n$3  millions  in 1955, of which $857,000  has  been\r\n\r\nrevoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 48: Education, Personal Emoluments\r\n\r\nhave   increased  from  $18.7  millions  to   $20.2\r\n\r\nmillions. 964 new appointments have been added,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmainly  for  probationary teachers.  This  gives  a\r\n\r\nclear  idea  of  the  rate  of  expansion  of   the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  There has been a substantial  increase\r\n\r\nin   the   provision   required   for   appointment\r\n\r\nallowances.   The  most  spectacular  increase   in\r\n\r\nestimated expenditure in the whole estimates occurs\r\n\r\nunder  Other  Charges Annually  Recurrent  in  this\r\n\r\nHead.  The contribution to the Education Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased by $9.4 millions. This is  entirely\r\n\r\ndue  to an increase in the provision for grants  in\r\n\r\naid  to schools, which has been increased by almost\r\n\r\n$10  millions. As hon. Members are aware, a  scheme\r\n\r\nfor the re-organisation of vernacular education  is\r\n\r\nunder  consideration and awaits the recommendations\r\n\r\nof the All-Party Committee. It is impossible at the\r\n\r\npresent  juncture to say exactly what the recurrent\r\n\r\ncost  of implementation of this scheme will be.  It\r\n\r\nis,  however, likely to be of the order of the cost\r\n\r\nof  full aid on the present basis to all vernacular\r\n\r\nschools  and  provision  on  this  basis  has  been\r\n\r\nentered in the estimates. It is desirable that this\r\n\r\nshould  be done so that the public can see clearly\r\n\r\nwhat the cost of vernacular education is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe. Put bluntly, it will add about $10 millions  to\r\n\r\nexisting  costs and from now on, the  estimates  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will be increased by that  amount.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  a  provision  of  $366,000  is  made  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Provident Fund and $250,000 has been\r\n\r\nprovided  for the cost of staff for the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nin  1956. Under Special Expenditure, a contribution\r\n\r\nof   $425,000  is  made  to  the  Education  Board,\r\n\r\ncompared  with  $1.9 millions  in  1955,  and  $1.4\r\n\r\nmillions  is provided in the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\nProvision  of $2.3 millions is made as  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontribution to the cost of the University in 1956.\r\n\r\nThis was previously shown under Head: Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nServices.  The  estimate  of  expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  in  1955  was $33.7  millions.  If  the\r\n\r\nincreased   grant  in  aid  to  schools   and   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the University are  excluded,  the\r\n\r\ntotal estimate in 1956 is $34.5 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 52: Medical and Health, provision is\r\n\r\nmade  for  560 new appointments. These  are  spread\r\n\r\nthroughout  the many departments and  divisions  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical  Department and reference must be  made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates to find out where and what they are.\r\n\r\nIn all, personal emoluments total $18.5 millions as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  $16.8 millions in  1955.  Recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure totals $8.1 millions compared with $8.2\r\n\r\nmillions in 1955. The contribution to the Hospitals\r\n\r\nBoard  and  Tan  Tock Seng are reduced  below  1955\r\n\r\nlevels. Again the special expenditure contribution\r\n\r\nto  the Board is reduced from $1.5 millions in 1955\r\n\r\nto  $979,000  in 1956. In all, Medical  and  Health\r\n\r\nexpenditure  totals  $28.8 millions  compared  with\r\n\r\n$27.4 millions in 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head 56: Social Welfare, provision for\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance  has  been  increased  from   $4\r\n\r\nmillions to $5 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some re-organisation under Head\r\n\r\n58:  Civil Aviation. The Regional Headquarters  has\r\n\r\nbeen  disbanded and the Department is now organised\r\n\r\non  a  Singapore  basis. The Regional  Air  Traffic\r\n\r\nControl  organisation however continues.  Increased\r\n\r\nprovision in staff and recurrent charges  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  for  the Singapore Airport, which is  now  in\r\n\r\noperation. The ambition of the Director-General  is\r\n\r\nto  run  the Terminal Building on commercial  lines\r\n\r\nand make it pay its own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision under Head 62: Public Works\r\n\r\nRecurrent  has been reduced from $6.9  millions  in\r\n\r\n1955 to $6.5 millions in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deficit of $22.7 millions in the\r\n\r\nordinary  Estimates of Revenue and  Expenditure,  a\r\n\r\nmatter on which I will touch later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are contained in a\r\n\r\nseparate  volume  which has been circulated  along\r\n\r\nwith the volume of ordinary estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original estimates of development expenditure\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by  departments totalled $75  millions,\r\n\r\nincluding  $38 millions for capital works  and  $37\r\n\r\nmillions for other development expenditure. It  was\r\n\r\nquite  clear that funds would not be available  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure on this scale, even  if  it\r\n\r\ncould be undertaken. In the end, the estimates were\r\n\r\ncut   to  the  more  reasonable  figure  of   $53.6\r\n\r\nmillions, which now appears in the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the financial aspects of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, it was clear that  the  only\r\n\r\nfunds  likely to be available were the  balance  in\r\n\r\nthe   Development   Fund  and  as   substantial   a\r\n\r\ncontribution  as  could be made from  revenue.  Any\r\n\r\nfunds  which we could borrow in 1956 - and we  will\r\n\r\nhave to borrow in that year - would be required  for\r\n\r\nother   commitments  such  as  housing,   telephone\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and similar matters which might  total\r\n\r\nas much as $35 millions. It was therefore necessary\r\n\r\nto  frame  a development budget within a  total  of\r\n\r\nabout  $50  millions to which would  be  added  any\r\n\r\nColonial  Development  and Welfare  Funds  accruing\r\n\r\nduring the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the Development Estimates provided\r\n\r\n$24  millions  for Special Development  expenditure\r\n\r\nincluding  purchase of land, cost of  resettlement,\r\n\r\ncontributions  to Boards and similar projects,  and\r\n\r\n$29.6  millions for capital works, of  which  $13.3\r\n\r\nmillions  represent  revotes.  Emphasis  has   been\r\n\r\nplaced  on social service development, and it  will\r\n\r\nbe seen that 34 per cent of the money available for\r\n\r\ncapital works has been devoted to Education and  24\r\n\r\nper cent to Medical and Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every possible effort has been made to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  projects in order of  importance  and\r\n\r\npriority, it is inevitable that some very important\r\n\r\nprojects  have  only been given  a  token  vote  or\r\n\r\nomitted  altogether. It is possible  that,  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  the  year,  savings  will  have  become\r\n\r\navailable  because of the inability of  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department to make the progress  which  was\r\n\r\nexpected on certain major items. Should this  prove\r\n\r\nto  be  the case, and the savings are not  required\r\n\r\nfor  other purposes, the authority of the  Assembly\r\n\r\nwill  be  sought to switch any available  funds  to\r\n\r\npriority  projects for which it has  not  yet  been\r\n\r\npossible  to  make provision. In this  way,  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped  to make the maximum use of the funds  likely\r\n\r\nto be available in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, there are other commitments\r\n\r\nof  a capital nature in addition to those appearing\r\n\r\nin   the  development  estimates.  Funds  for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of low rental housing will have to  be\r\n\r\nsupplied to the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. It is hoped that the Trust  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to build new units to a value of at  least\r\n\r\n$18 millions in 1956, although much will depend  on\r\n\r\nwhether  some solution can be found for the problem\r\n\r\nof  clearing  suitable sites. A  sum  of  about  $7\r\n\r\nmillions  will be required for essential  telephone\r\n\r\ndevelopment. $4 millions will be required as a loan\r\n\r\nto   the  City  Council  for  the  construction  of\r\n\r\napproach  roads  to the new Kallang  Bridge.  Other\r\n\r\ncommitments  such  as  flood  alleviation,  housing\r\n\r\nloans,  etc.,  may amount to about $5  millions.  In\r\n\r\nall,  these  commitments are likely to total  about\r\n\r\n$35  millions.  Part of this sum can  be  met  from\r\n\r\nliquid balances but the great bulk of it will  have\r\n\r\nto  be borrowed in 1956. This may not be altogether\r\n\r\neasy.  There  will  be other  borrowers  on  a  not\r\n\r\nunlimited market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that we are faced with\r\n\r\na deficit of $22.7 millions in 1956. With regard to\r\n\r\nthis estimated deficit, attention will no doubt  be\r\n\r\ninvited  to  the experience of previous years  when\r\n\r\neven  larger estimated deficits have been converted\r\n\r\ninto surpluses, admittedly growing smaller year  by\r\n\r\nyear,  but surpluses just the same. To this  I  can\r\n\r\nonly  reply that this will not happen in  1956.  In\r\n\r\nthe  first  place,  the  factors,  which  converted\r\n\r\ndeficits  into  surpluses in the  past  no  longer\r\n\r\noperate  to  the  same extent.  Public  Works  Non-Recurrent  estimated expenditure no longer  appears\r\n\r\nin  the  ordinary estimates. Instead, its place  is\r\n\r\ntaken  by  a contribution to development, which  is\r\n\r\ncertain  to  be spent. Equipment for which  special\r\n\r\nexpenditure is required is now in free  supply  and\r\n\r\ndeliveries are no longer delayed as they have  been\r\n\r\nin the past. There is no longer the same likelihood\r\n\r\nof  under-expenditure  and  consequent  revotes  as\r\n\r\nthere  has  been in the past. In the second  place,\r\n\r\nthe  estimates of recurrent and special expenditure\r\n\r\nhave,  in fact, been literally cut to the  bone.  I\r\n\r\ncan  see  no possibility of any savings on ordinary\r\n\r\ndepartmental  recurrent expenditure. Again,  having\r\n\r\nregard to the way in which special expenditure  has\r\n\r\nbeen pruned, it is difficult to see much likelihood\r\n\r\nof  savings there. On the other hand, I cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  will be no savings. Some savings on personal\r\n\r\nemoluments are inevitable. They may be substantial.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, performance invariably falls short\r\n\r\nof  expectation. There may also be some savings  on\r\n\r\ngrants  in  aid. The sum entered provisionally  for\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  for the re-organisation of  vernacular\r\n\r\nschools  may in the event be found to be more  than\r\n\r\nis   required  in  1956.  Against  these   savings,\r\n\r\nhowever,  there are bound to be unforeseen  revotes\r\n\r\nand  expenditure on applications for  supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision.  I would not like to hazard a  guess - for\r\n\r\nit  would be no more than a guess - as to the  actual\r\n\r\ndeficit  which  will be shown at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear's   workings.   Too  many  imponderables   are\r\n\r\ninvolved.  All  I can say, with any certainty,  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  experience of past  years  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrepeated  and that the actual deficit is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe substantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be convenient to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  endeavour  to estimate the probable  course  of\r\n\r\nrevenue and expenditure over the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already endeavoured to show how revenue,\r\n\r\non  the  basis of existing taxation, is tending  to\r\n\r\nlevel off at about the $205 millions mark, and how,\r\n\r\nif  there  were any slight recession of  trade,  it\r\n\r\nmight well fall lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attempt has also been made to show, in the\r\n\r\ntable,  which  appears on pages 10 and  11  of  the\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper,  how expenditure  on  the  social\r\n\r\nservices has increased over the past five years. It\r\n\r\nwill  be  seen  that actual recurrent  expenditure,\r\n\r\nexcluding  special expenditure,  on  Education  has\r\n\r\nmounted  since  1951 as follows:  - $10.7  millions,\r\n\r\n$14.1 millions, $15.4 millions, $23.3 millions  and\r\n\r\n$31  millions. The figures for Medical  and  Health\r\n\r\nare equally significant and are as follows: - $11.5\r\n\r\nmillions,  $14.2  millions, $15.2  millions,  $18.8\r\n\r\nmillions   and  $22  millions.  If  the  curve   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  created by these figures is  projected\r\n\r\ninto  the  future,  and  if  $9  millions  for  the\r\n\r\nadditional cost of vernacular education is added to\r\n\r\nthe figure for education, the staggering figure  of\r\n\r\n$106  millions  is  reached in 1959  for  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  education and medical  and  health\r\n\r\nalone. This would be an increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof 100 per cent on actual expenditure over a period\r\n\r\nof five years. Fortunately, however, it is unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  recurrent expenditure on these services  will\r\n\r\nincrease at these extraordinary rates. I think that\r\n\r\nit  is  now  appreciated that the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\nterritory cannot stand expansion on what  has  been\r\n\r\ncalled a \"champagne\" basis. Standards can and  must\r\n\r\nbe  reduced without affecting efficiency. As  staff\r\n\r\nis  trained and becomes more experienced, it can do\r\n\r\nmore.    As    the   organisation   shakes    down,\r\n\r\nextravagances  in staff and equipment,  which  have\r\n\r\npreviously  passed  unnoticed  can  be  seen   and\r\n\r\nremoved. Again, it is perhaps true to say that,  in\r\n\r\ncertain respects, the back of the present programme\r\n\r\nof  expansion is some way to being broken and  that\r\n\r\nincreases in expenditure in the future will not  be\r\n\r\nquite  so  steep as they have been  in  the  recent\r\n\r\npast. It is clear, however, that, no matter what steps  we  take to reduce expenditure, to  increase\r\n\r\nefficiency and to make our resources stretch as far\r\n\r\nas possible - and these steps must be taken - recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on social services is going  to  mount\r\n\r\nsteadily in the future. When one takes into account\r\n\r\nthe  inevitable expansion of the Government machine\r\n\r\nin   sympathy   with  an  expanding  economy,   the\r\n\r\nincreased charges on account of public debt as more\r\n\r\nand  more is borrowed for development purposes, and\r\n\r\nthe  planned expansion of defence service, it  will\r\n\r\nbe appreciated that the estimate, which was made in\r\n\r\nthe  Sessional Paper to the effect that expenditure\r\n\r\non  all the services of Government might well be in\r\n\r\nexcess of $240 millions by the end of 1959, may not\r\n\r\nbe  very wide of the mark. In other words,  on  the\r\n\r\npresent basis of revenue receipts, we might by that\r\n\r\ntime  be  facing  an  actual deficit  of  over  $40\r\n\r\nmillions. Quite clearly, all practicable steps will\r\n\r\nhave  to be taken to increase revenue so that  this\r\n\r\ndeficit can be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position with regard to development\r\n\r\nexpenditure also gives equal cause for concern.  In\r\n\r\nso  far as one can make an estimate on the basis of\r\n\r\nthe  legitimate  needs of the various  departments,\r\n\r\nthe capacity of Government to execute work, and the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  the  Singapore Improvement  Trust  to\r\n\r\nclear sites and build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouses,  it  appears  likely that  Government  will\r\n\r\nrequire an average of about $50-$60 millions a year\r\n\r\nfor  development of one kind and another  over  the\r\n\r\nnext few years. As recurrent expenditure mounts, so\r\n\r\nability  to  make any contribution from revenue  to\r\n\r\ndevelopment will decrease and, before very long, we\r\n\r\nshall  reach  the stage when we shall  be  entirely\r\n\r\nreliant  on  borrowings  or reserves.  This  raises\r\n\r\nserious problems. We must take care not to let  our\r\n\r\nreserves  run down too far. In fact, they  are  not\r\n\r\nvery large in relation to the potential demands  on\r\n\r\nthem.  The  local loan market is not  unlimited  in\r\n\r\ncapacity.  There  will be other  borrowers  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket  besides Government. Access to other markets\r\n\r\nmay  be  difficult  to  obtain.  We  may  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  obtain  all  we  require.   Clearly\r\n\r\ntherefore we must make sure that our plans  include\r\n\r\nonly  those  projects which are of vital importance\r\n\r\nto  the  well-being and development  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthat nothing is included which does not measure  up\r\n\r\nexactly  to  these standards, and  that  the  money\r\n\r\nwhich  we  do  obtain  is made  to  go  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible. This may require a re-examination of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans in the light  of  the  resources\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  available. Steps have already  been\r\n\r\ntaken to examine the standards of construction  and\r\n\r\nequipment   used  in  connection  with   Government\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, the position is that, on the\r\n\r\npresent basis of revenue, we are faced in 1956 with\r\n\r\nan   actual   deficit  which  is  likely   to   be\r\n\r\nsubstantial  and  that,  despite  all  practicable\r\n\r\nsteps which can be taken to keep expenditure  to  a\r\n\r\nminimum, this deficit could easily be of the  order\r\n\r\nof $40 millions by 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was against this background that the review of\r\n\r\nthe  revenue potential envisaged in His  Excellency\r\n\r\nthe   Governor's  Address  to  the   Assembly   was\r\n\r\nundertaken, and the Government's original proposals\r\n\r\nfor increased taxation in 1956 drawn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was undertaken before the arrival of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Adviser whose expert  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nwide experience would have been invaluable. On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, having regard to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime available, it was comprehensive and covered  a\r\n\r\nwide  field. Consideration was given to the general\r\n\r\nprinciples   of   taxation   in   Singapore,    the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  increasing  existing   rates   of\r\n\r\ntaxation   was  examined,  and  the  more   obvious\r\n\r\nproposals for new taxation were explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the review indicated that: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly: having regard to the free port status of\r\n\r\nSingapore and to its almost complete dependence  on\r\n\r\ntrade,  the whole system of taxation should  be  as\r\n\r\ndirect  and  as simple as possible. Any  system  of\r\n\r\ntaxation  which interfered with the free  flow  of\r\n\r\ntrade, should be avoided as far possible. Secondly: having  regard to the close economic  ties  between\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  and Singapore,  it  was  generally\r\n\r\ndesirable  and in some cases essential,  where  the\r\n\r\nfiscal  policies of the two territories  coincided,\r\n\r\nto   have  the  same  rates  of  tax.  Thirdly:  by\r\n\r\ncomparison    with   adjoining   and   neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories,  Singapore  appeared  to  be   lightly\r\n\r\ntaxed. There appeared to be considerable scope  for\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation within the existing  framework.\r\n\r\nFourthly: in so far as it was possible to  estimate\r\n\r\nfuture  needs  over,  say, a five-year  period,  it\r\n\r\nappeared  possible  that  these  needs  might,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  could  perhaps best, be  met  by  judicious\r\n\r\nincreases  within  the  existing,  established,  and\r\n\r\nfamiliar framework of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the probable deficit in 1956, it\r\n\r\nwas  considered  that  this  might  be  met  by  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the rate of tax in the higher ranges of\r\n\r\nassessable  income,  by  increasing  the  rates  of\r\n\r\nestate  duty, and by imposing an additional fee  on\r\n\r\nthe first registration of motorcars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to income tax, it was considered that\r\n\r\nit  would  be just to tackle higher incomes  before\r\n\r\nconsidering proposals to alter personal allowances,\r\n\r\nlower  the minimum level of taxable income or alter\r\n\r\nthe  rates  of  tax on the lower and  middle income\r\n\r\ngroups.  It  is  clear that there  is  considerable\r\n\r\nscope  for  increased taxation in the upper  income\r\n\r\ngroups.  In this connection, I feel sure that  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will have seen the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatistics  of  income tax rates  in  all  Colonial\r\n\r\nterritories  which  were  given  in  reply   to   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary Question earlier this year. They were\r\n\r\npublished  in  Hansard and also in the  August  6th\r\n\r\nedition   of  the  publication  \"Taxation\".   These\r\n\r\nstatistics indicated very clearly that Singapore is\r\n\r\nmost fortunately placed in the matter of income tax\r\n\r\nin  general but more particularly in respect of the\r\n\r\nrates  of tax in the higher income brackets.  These\r\n\r\nstatistics can be made available if hon. Members so\r\n\r\ndesire.  As  regards  the  increases,  which   were\r\n\r\nproposed  for  the  higher income  groups,  it  was\r\n\r\nsuggested that the rate of tax on incomes  of  over\r\n\r\n$25,000  should be increased progressively until  a\r\n\r\nceiling  of  60 per cent was reached on incomes  of\r\n\r\n$100,000  and over. As hon. Members are aware,  the\r\n\r\npresent  ceiling  is  30 per  cent  on  incomes  of\r\n\r\n$50,000.  It  was estimated that this  increase  in\r\n\r\nrate  of  tax would produce $9 millions in  a  full\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Estate Duty, it had been felt for\r\n\r\nsome  time  that the rates of tax, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of large estates, were too low.  It  was\r\n\r\ntherefore proposed that the rates of tax should  be\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased along the whole range.  The\r\n\r\nexisting scale reaches a maximum of 40 per cent  on\r\n\r\nestates of $5 millions. The proposed scale gave  an\r\n\r\neffective rate of tax of rather more than 50 per cent on estates of this amount. At the other end of\r\n\r\nthe  scale, however, estates of under $10,000  were\r\n\r\nto  be exempted from duty. It was considered, in so\r\n\r\nfar as it was possible to make an estimate that the\r\n\r\nnew  scale might yield an additional $1.5  millions\r\n\r\nin a full year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals for an additional motor car\r\n\r\nregistration fee, in their original form, aimed  at\r\n\r\nimposing  a graduated rate on c.i.f. values,  which\r\n\r\nit  was estimated might yield $1 million in a  full\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals were in accordance with the\r\n\r\ngeneral principles of taxation policy which I have\r\n\r\nalready outlined. They were in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nstated  taxation  policy of the  Government,  which\r\n\r\naims  at  placing  the burden of  taxation  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of those best able to bear it,  and  they\r\n\r\nhad the additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvantage, since the first and last required  joint\r\n\r\naction by the Federation Government, that they  had\r\n\r\nall in the past been suggested by that Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thought that the yield from these\r\n\r\nproposals would probably go a very long way to meet\r\n\r\nthe deficit which would occur in 1956. Any further\r\n\r\nrevenue, which might be required could be obtained\r\n\r\nby  judicious increases on certain customs  duties.\r\n\r\nThese  now showed a wide divergence from  those  in\r\n\r\nforce  in the Federation. It seemed clear that,  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases,  the  gap between the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  rates could, on the basis of  Federation\r\n\r\nexperience,   be   narrowed  without   consequences\r\n\r\nharmful  either to the revenue or to the  consumer.\r\n\r\nThis  major  revision of the Customs  tariff  could\r\n\r\nremain in reserve for use at a later date. The same\r\n\r\napplied  to  any  major modification  in  the  main\r\n\r\nincome tax structure and to changes in company tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage I should perhaps mention the\r\n\r\nquestion of purchase or luxury taxes. Proposals for\r\n\r\ntaxes  of this nature have been made from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime  in the past but for a variety of reasons have\r\n\r\nnever  met  with  favour. The  proposal  was  again\r\n\r\nexamined  in  connection with  the  review  of  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  potential. It was immediately  clear  that\r\n\r\nthe matter was fraught with difficulties. Singapore\r\n\r\nis a free port, almost entirely dependent on trade.\r\n\r\nIf  any  system of purchase tax on a wide range  of\r\n\r\ngoods  were  to be effective, it would have  to  be\r\n\r\nimposed  as  close  to  the  point  of  import   as\r\n\r\npossible.  Imposition  at the  retail  level  would\r\n\r\nclearly  be  difficult to control  effectively  and\r\n\r\nmight  well  prove impracticable on  that  account.\r\n\r\nImposition at import level would clearly have  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable effects on the free flow of trade  and\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  be subjected to a  most  searching\r\n\r\nexamination as to its implications, possible  yield\r\n\r\nand  effect on trade before any decision was  taken\r\n\r\nabout  it.  This examination could clearly  not  be\r\n\r\ncompleted before the 1956 budget was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration was also given to the imposition of\r\n\r\na  luxury tax on one or two commodities which  were\r\n\r\nhandled  by a comparatively few traders  and  which did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   enter   into  the  entrepot  trade   to   any\r\n\r\nconsiderable extent. Apart from lack of  experience\r\n\r\nin  Singapore of the administration of such  a  tax\r\n\r\nand the difficulty of drafting suitable legislation\r\n\r\nin  the time available, it was found that the yield\r\n\r\nat the rate of tax which it was considered could be\r\n\r\nimposed   in   the   first   instance   would    be\r\n\r\ndisappointingly small compared to  the  yield  from\r\n\r\nother   measures  of  taxation  which  were   under\r\n\r\nconsideration and it was decided not to pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter at least for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was therefore decided to suggest to the\r\n\r\nFederation Government that the rates of income  tax\r\n\r\nand estate duty should be increased as proposed and\r\n\r\nthat an additional motor car registration fee should\r\n\r\nbe  imposed  in  connection with the 1956  Budgets.\r\n\r\nThis was done because of the desirability of having\r\n\r\na  common  fiscal policy and because, for at  least\r\n\r\ntwo   of   the  proposals,  joint  action  by   the\r\n\r\nFederation was essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal was made on the 19th of September\r\n\r\nand the details were discussed in Kuala Lumpur with\r\n\r\ncordiality and understanding on the 6th of October.\r\n\r\nSubsequently they were considered by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, and a decision was reached on  the  2nd\r\n\r\nof  November.  The desirability of a common  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy,  in  so  far as this was  practicable,  was\r\n\r\nfully   appreciated   and   the   Government    had\r\n\r\nconsiderable sympathy with the proposals which had\r\n\r\nbeen  made. It was pointed out, however,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had only come into power in August  and\r\n\r\nhad  been much pre-occupied since that date. It had\r\n\r\nnot  yet  had  time  to consider economic  planning\r\n\r\nwhich  might require increased taxation or to  work\r\n\r\nout a fiscal policy. In fact, in order to gain time\r\n\r\nto  consider  these  matters  at  leisure,  it  had\r\n\r\ndecided  to adopt a standstill budget in  1956.  In\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances, it could not see its  way  to\r\n\r\nintroduce these proposals for new taxation  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision has placed this Government in an\r\n\r\nawkward  predicament.  We  cannot  for  the  moment\r\n\r\nproceed with the proposals for increased tax on the\r\n\r\nhigher  income  groups and for  an  additional  car\r\n\r\nregistration fee since these two proposals  require\r\n\r\njoint  action in the two territories. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, steps must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  taken to meet the 1956 deficit. The whole order\r\n\r\nof  the  taxation programme which I have outlined\r\n\r\nhas had to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding to outline the results of this\r\n\r\nreview, I should perhaps explain why common  action\r\n\r\nin  respect of income tax is regarded as essential.\r\n\r\nThe  close economic relations, which exist  between\r\n\r\nthe  two territories demand that the rates of  tax\r\n\r\nshould be the same in each territory. The wisdom of\r\n\r\nthis  view  has  been borne out by experience.  The\r\n\r\nabandonment  of this position would  give  rise  to\r\n\r\ngrave   administrative   difficulties   and   would\r\n\r\nadversely  affect the yield of tax.  The  proposals\r\n\r\nfor assessment of combined income would have to  be\r\n\r\nabandoned if different rates of tax applied in each\r\n\r\nterritory, since neither would have jurisdiction to\r\n\r\ntax  income  at rates different from those  imposed\r\n\r\nunder   its  own  ordinance.  Abandonment  of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  for combined assessment under  which  a\r\n\r\nsingle return is lodged and a single assessment  is\r\n\r\nmade  in respect of a person having income in  both\r\n\r\nterritories  would cause trouble  and  considerably\r\n\r\nincrease   the  work  carried  out   by   the   two\r\n\r\ndepartments. A more serious consequence would be  a\r\n\r\nfall  in  the  aggregate yield of tax. At  present,\r\n\r\nindividuals who derive income from both territories\r\n\r\nand  who are either resident in one territory  only\r\n\r\nor  resident  in both, receive one set of  personal\r\n\r\nallowances.   If   there  were  entirely   separate\r\n\r\nsystems,  individuals  who  were  resident  in  one\r\n\r\nterritory  would  be  entitled  to  full   personal\r\n\r\nallowances  in  the territory of residence  and  to\r\n\r\nrelief corresponding to that given under section 36\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance in the other territory in respect\r\n\r\nof income arising there, while individuals resident\r\n\r\nin  both territories would be entitled to a  double\r\n\r\nset  of  allowances and would have their chargeable\r\n\r\nincome  in each territory taxed at graduated rates.\r\n\r\nAgain,  fiscal  policies  considered  in  isolation\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to differing rates of tax,  allowances\r\n\r\nand reliefs, depending on the economic needs of the\r\n\r\nterritory concerned. Differences of this kind would\r\n\r\nencourage  taxpayers,  particularly  companies;  to\r\n\r\nchange  their residence and capital would  tend  to\r\n\r\nflow  into  the territory where the  net  yield  of\r\n\r\nincome was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlikely  to be greater. From the economic standpoint\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  as a whole, the repercussion  would  be\r\n\r\nmost   unfortunate.  Evasion  of   tax   would   be\r\n\r\nsimplified  in  the case of persons having  incomes\r\n\r\narising  in  both territories Persons  carrying  on\r\n\r\nsimilar  businesses  in each territory  would  have\r\n\r\nlittle  difficulty in making notional transfers  of\r\n\r\nstock   at  fictitious  prices  between   the   two\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  would be able to manipulate  their\r\n\r\nprofits at will. It would be necessary to introduce\r\n\r\ndouble  taxation arrangements to provide for relief\r\n\r\nin  respect of tax in both territories. These  are,\r\n\r\nin  brief,  the  reasons why a  common  income  tax\r\n\r\npolicy has always been regarded as essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common policy with regard to additional\r\n\r\nregistration fees on motor cars is desirable in view\r\n\r\nof  the difficulties of control, which would  arise\r\n\r\nif unilateral action were taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, the second wave of our\r\n\r\nproposed  taxation programme consisted of increases\r\n\r\non  customs duties, on liquor, petrol and  tobacco.\r\n\r\nThere were differences, in some cases wide, between\r\n\r\nthe Singapore and Federation tariffs. Experience in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation indicated that these gaps could  be\r\n\r\nsubstantially  narrowed, if not closed  altogether,\r\n\r\nwithout  harm either to consumption or to  revenue.\r\n\r\nThe  yields  would be substantial. For example,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  on  the duty on cigarettes to  Federation\r\n\r\nlevels  would yield $19 millions on present  levels\r\n\r\nof   consumption.  It  was  proposed  to  introduce\r\n\r\nmeasures  of  increased taxation progressively,  as\r\n\r\nthe   need   arose,  over  the  years,   until   we\r\n\r\napproximated  as closely as possible to  Federation\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in view of the Federation decision, the\r\n\r\nwhole programme has had to be reviewed and switched\r\n\r\naround.   The   whole  customs  tariff   has   been\r\n\r\nconsidered, and it has been decided that  it  would\r\n\r\nbe  undesirable at the present time to increase the\r\n\r\ntax  on  cigarettes  by even a  small  amount.  The\r\n\r\nburden  of meeting the 1956 deficit therefore  fell\r\n\r\non  liquors and petrol. It was decided to raise the\r\n\r\nduties on samsu half-way to Federation levels,  the\r\n\r\nduties  on still wines and beer, ale and  stout  to\r\n\r\nFedera-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion  levels  and the duties on brandy  and  whisky\r\n\r\nbeyond Federation levels. The duty on petrol should\r\n\r\nbe raised to Federation levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reaching these decisions, the Council of\r\n\r\nMinisters had in mind that intoxicating liquor was,\r\n\r\nin  fact, a luxury. It could not, by any stretch of\r\n\r\nthe  imagination,  be called a  necessity.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  they  had  little   hesitation   in\r\n\r\nraising  the  duties steeply, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of whisky and brandy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in customs duties have already been\r\n\r\ngazetted under the Public Revenue Protection\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The increases in detail are as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Brandy and other intoxicating liquor not\r\n\r\nhereinafter provided for.</i> - The  full duty is increased from $61.50 per proof\r\n\r\ngallon   to   $76.90   per   proof   gallon.   The\r\n\r\npreferential  duty is increased  from  $53.80  per\r\n\r\nproof gallon to $69.20 per proof gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Brandy in bottle.</i> - The full duty is increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $48  per  gallon to $60 per gallon  and  the\r\n\r\npreferential duty from $42 per gallon to  $54  per\r\n\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Samsu</i>(including medicated samsu). - The import\r\n\r\nduty  is increased from $27 per gallon to $31  per\r\n\r\ngallon and the excise duty from $24 per gallon  to $27 per gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still wines exceeding 26 per cent but not\r\n\r\nexceeding  42 per cent of proof spirit.</i> - The  full\r\n\r\nduty  is  increased from $15 to $18.75 per  gallon\r\n\r\nand  the preferential duty from $11.25 to $15  per\r\n\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Still wines not exceeding 26 per cent of proof\r\n\r\nspirit.</i> - The full duty is increased  from  $7.50\r\n\r\nto  $9.40  per  gallon and the preferential  duty\r\n\r\nfrom $5.60 to $7.50 per gallon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ale, beer, stout, etc.</i> - The full duty is\r\n\r\nincreased  from $4 to $5.20 per gallon  and  the\r\n\r\npreferential and excise duty from $3.60 to $4.80\r\n\r\nper gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whisky in bulk.</i> - The duty is increased from $61.50 to $76.90 per proof gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Whisky in bottle.</i> - The duty is increased from $48 to $60 per gallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a quart bottle of brandy and whisky\r\n\r\nwill  be  increased  by $2 as  a  result  of  these\r\n\r\nincreases in duty. The price of a peg on  a  24  to\r\n\r\nthe  bottle  basis  will be increased  by  about  8\r\n\r\ncents.   Making  due  allowance  for   a   possible\r\n\r\nreduction in consumption, it is estimated that  the\r\n\r\nincreased  duty  on  these  two  commodities   will\r\n\r\nrealise close on $1.5 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on samsu has been raised slightly more\r\n\r\nthan  half-way  to  the Federation  level  and  this\r\n\r\nincrease will result in the price of a quart bottle\r\n\r\nbeing  increased from $8.70 to $9.37 a bottle.  The\r\n\r\nexcise   duty  has  been  increased  to  $27,   the\r\n\r\ndifferential between the duties on the imported and\r\n\r\nlocal product being increased by $1. The cost of  a\r\n\r\nquart bottle of local samsu will be increased  from\r\n\r\n$5.50  to  $6. It is expected that these  increases\r\n\r\nwill yield about $300,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferential duty on still wines has been\r\n\r\nincreased   to   Federation  levels,  the   existing\r\n\r\ndifferential  between full and  preferential  rates\r\n\r\nbeing maintained. The increased duties are expected\r\n\r\nto yield $130.000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The import duties on ale, beer, stout etc., have\r\n\r\nbeen  increased to Federation levels and the excise\r\n\r\nduty  has been maintained at the same level as  the\r\n\r\npreferential  rate. The effect of  these  increases\r\n\r\nwill  be  to increase the present price of  a  pint\r\n\r\nbottle of beer by 10 cents and a quart bottle by 20\r\n\r\ncents.  It  is  expected that these increases  will\r\n\r\nyield about $2.8 millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax on petrol will be increased from 68 cents\r\n\r\na  gallon  to  73  cents  a gallon  which  is  the\r\n\r\nFederation rate of duty. This increase in the  cost\r\n\r\nof  petrol  should  cause no  hardship  and  it  is\r\n\r\nexpected to yield $1.2 millions in a full year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the rates of\r\n\r\nestate  duty.  The rates which are  proposed  are\r\n\r\ngiven  in the Schedule to the Bill, which has  been\r\n\r\ntabled  for  a  First Reading today.  Attention  is\r\n\r\ninvited to certain details of these rates.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, it is proposed to exempt all  estates\r\n\r\nof  under $10,000 from duty. The previous exemption\r\n\r\nlimit was $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  amount  of  duty collected  from  these  small\r\n\r\nestates,  which it is now proposed to  exempt,  was\r\n\r\nrelatively  small.  The exemption  of  these  small\r\n\r\nestates, besides assisting the beneficiaries,  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  considerable  saving  in  the  work  of\r\n\r\ncollection  of  duty and allow available  staff  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on large estates. Secondly, it will  be\r\n\r\nnoted  that  the  same form of graduated  scale  as\r\n\r\napplies in income tax has been introduced. This has\r\n\r\nthe  advantage of giving a smoother  curve  in  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of graduations and obviates the need  for\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions for marginal  relief.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthe  scale provides for an increased rate  of  duty\r\n\r\nalong the whole range. The effect of this can  only\r\n\r\nbe  fully  appreciated if the  scale  of  effective\r\n\r\nrates,  which is attached to the Bill for  purposes\r\n\r\nof  information, is studied. For example, the  rate\r\n\r\nof  duty  on an estate of $220,000 was 9 per  cent.\r\n\r\nThe effective rate under the new scale is 13.98 per\r\n\r\ncent.  On estates of $920,000, the old rate was  23\r\n\r\nper cent and the effective rate under the new scale\r\n\r\nis 31.77 per cent and so on. It has been considered\r\n\r\nfor  some  time that the existing rates  of  estate\r\n\r\nduty,   particularly  in  respect  of  the   larger\r\n\r\nestates,  was unduly low and it is considered  that\r\n\r\nthe  new rates go some way to placing the incidence\r\n\r\nof taxation on a proper basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures should yield about $7.5 millions\r\n\r\nin a full year. This is likely to go only a part of\r\n\r\nthe  way  towards  meeting the  1956  deficit.  The\r\n\r\nbalance, when its size becomes clear, will have to be\r\n\r\nmet  from  reserves or else covered by  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, therefore, are the budget proposals for 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have shown, our immediate position is\r\n\r\nreasonably healthy but the rapid increase  of  both\r\n\r\nrecurrent and development expenditure means that we\r\n\r\nare  faced  with  mounting difficulties  in  future\r\n\r\nyears.  To  meet  these increased expenditures,  we\r\n\r\nshall   have  to  find  increased  resources  since\r\n\r\nneither  our  usable reserves nor the possibilities\r\n\r\nof  borrowing are unlimited. In these proposals the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is taking the first steps towards  that\r\n\r\nincrease of our resources and strengthening of  our\r\n\r\nfuture financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition.  I  must emphasise that these  are  first\r\n\r\nsteps  only,  and  further  strengthening  of  the\r\n\r\nposition will be needed in future years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I should like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity to thank all those who have assisted in\r\n\r\nthe  preparation  of  the  Draft  Estimates.

I fully appreciate, Sir, that\r\n\r\nit is ordinarily very desirable that Members should\r\n\r\nhave   a   longer  time  in  which  to  study   the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  legislation which  is  introduced\r\n\r\ninto  this Assembly for their consideration; but  I\r\n\r\nhope,  Sir,  that  the explanatory  note  which  is\r\n\r\nappended to the printed copy of the Bill will  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sufficient to inform Members of  the  purpose\r\n\r\nand  the  effect of the amendments  which  are  now\r\n\r\nproposed. I venture to hope, Sir that the nature of\r\n\r\nthose amendments will enable the Assembly to give a\r\n\r\nwelcome to this measure, a welcome which we on this\r\n\r\nside of the House consider that it deserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as is perfectly clear from the title of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, its purpose is to amend the law relating\r\n\r\nto  bankruptcy. It is, Sir, a branch of the law  of\r\n\r\nwhich  relatively  few of us have  any  specialised\r\n\r\nknowledge and with which most of us are,  I  think,\r\n\r\nunfamiliar.  For this reason, Sir, it will  not,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  be  out  of place if, in moving  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Bill, I were to preface my  remarks\r\n\r\nwith a few rather general observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it can be stated, with reference to the\r\n\r\nexisting  bankruptcy  laws of  Singapore - and  I  am\r\n\r\nspeaking  very generally - that their purpose  is  to\r\n\r\npreserve  and  maintain  a fair  and  even  balance\r\n\r\nbetween the debtor who cannot pay his debts and his\r\n\r\ncreditors,  and  also to maintain  such  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the creditors as amongst themselves.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  achieve that purpose, a debtor's property\r\n\r\nand  his  financial  affairs  are  taken  from  his\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  put into the hands of a  manager  and\r\n\r\ntrustee. Here in Singapore that manager and trustee\r\n\r\nis  the Official Assignee, and it is, of course, to\r\n\r\nthe  Official Assignee that a bankrupt's  creditors\r\n\r\nmust look for payment of their claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this Bill is particularly concerned\r\n\r\nwith  two  provisions of the Bankruptcy  Ordinance;\r\n\r\nthe  first  of  those provisions being  that  which\r\n\r\nenables  a  creditor to make his debtor a  bankrupt\r\n\r\nwhere  the  debt amounts to $100 or more.  And  the\r\n\r\nsecond of the two provisions with which the Bill is\r\n\r\nparticularly  concerned, Sir, is that  which  gives\r\n\r\npriority to the claims of a bankrupt's employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin respect of unpaid wages up to a maximum of $250,\r\n\r\nwhere  those  wages  have been earned  within  four\r\n\r\nmonths of the date of the receiving order; that is,\r\n\r\nthe  order  which makes the Official  Assignee  the\r\n\r\nreceiver of the property of the bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the fall in the value of money which\r\n\r\nhas taken place in recent years, particularly since\r\n\r\nthe  last  war,  has clearly, in the  view  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, made the two provisions to which I have\r\n\r\njust  referred obsolete. Accordingly, what  is  now\r\n\r\nproposed  by  this amending Bill is, firstly,  that\r\n\r\nthe sum of $100 to which I have referred should  be\r\n\r\nincreased to $500. That is effected by clause 2  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Putting  it  in another  way,  if  that\r\n\r\namendment becomes part of the law, the position  in\r\n\r\nfuture will be that a debtor must owe a minimum  of\r\n\r\n$500  before he can be made a bankrupt, instead  of\r\n\r\n$100   as  at  present.  Now,  Sir,  this  proposal\r\n\r\nnecessitates  a number of consequential  amendments\r\n\r\nto  the Bankruptcy Ordinance and those are detailed\r\n\r\nin  the  explanatory note to which I have referred,\r\n\r\nand  on that account I do not propose to refer  to\r\n\r\nthem in any detail at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second amendment of importance which is\r\n\r\nproposed by this Bill is the raising of the  amount\r\n\r\nof  an  employee's claim to which priority is given\r\n\r\nin  the  distribution  of his  bankrupt  employer's\r\n\r\nassets - the raising of his priority claim from  $250\r\n\r\nto  $1,000 - and  linked with that  amendment,  Sir - which  is  made  by  clause  5,  the  proposed  new\r\n\r\nparagraph  (c)  of  section 43  of  the  Bankruptcy\r\n\r\nOrdinance, - is an amendment which gives priority to\r\n\r\nwages  earned during the period of five  months  as\r\n\r\nagainst   the   existing  period  of  four   months\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding the date  of  the  receiving\r\n\r\norder; or - and this is new - during any period of five\r\n\r\nmonths within the twelve months preceding that date\r\n\r\nwhere  the employee's services have been determined\r\n\r\nbefore that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the opportunity has also been taken, in\r\n\r\ndrafting this amending Bill, to insert provision to\r\n\r\ngive priority to income tax in the distribution  of\r\n\r\na  bankrupt's  property; and  a  further  provision\r\n\r\nwhich is included in the Bill is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat made by clause 8, which is designed to enable\r\n\r\ndeductions, which are made from a bankrupt's salary\r\n\r\nor  wages for the benefit of his creditors,  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  in accordance with the scale to be prescribed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister. These deductions, Sir, will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, remain, subject to variation by the  Court.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment,  Sir,  is also  considered  to  be\r\n\r\nnecessary because the existing scale is thought  to\r\n\r\nbe  out of date by reason of the fall in the  value\r\n\r\nof  money which has taken place, particularly since\r\n\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should also refer at this stage, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  the  proposal made by clause 5 (ii), the  clause\r\n\r\nagainst   which   there   is   a   marginal    note\r\n\r\n\"Transitional provisions\". With reference to  that,\r\n\r\nI  would say very little more than appears  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  explanatory note and  merely  content\r\n\r\nmyself  with indicating that the purpose  of  those\r\n\r\nprovisions is to provide for the application of the\r\n\r\namendments  relating to preferential  payments,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have referred and which are  proposed  by\r\n\r\nclause   5   (i),  to  cases  already   under   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of the Official Assignee  where  no\r\n\r\ndividend  has been declared and no distribution  of\r\n\r\nassets  has  begun,  but  that  those  preferential\r\n\r\namendments  should apply on a date to  be  appointed\r\n\r\nunder the clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is very little which I need\r\n\r\nadd  now in moving the Second Reading. I would like\r\n\r\njust  to  say  this: that it is  the  view  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that if the Bill is passed, it will go a\r\n\r\nlong  way towards bringing the Bankruptcy Ordinance\r\n\r\nup  to date so far as changes in the value of money\r\n\r\nare  concerned, and it will remedy those  parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bankruptcy Ordinance which are in this respect\r\n\r\nconsidered to be obsolete. The amendments proposed,\r\n\r\nSir,  will  improve the position of  employees  who\r\n\r\nclaim  for wages from a bankrupt employer and  will\r\n\r\nalso  prevent  the  somewhat  drastic  process   of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy being used for debts, which,  by  reason\r\n\r\nof  the change in the value of money, are too small\r\n\r\nto justify such a course. For these reasons, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhope that the measure will be welcomed by all sides\r\n\r\nof this Assembly, and I accordingly beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  support the Bill before the House.  We\r\n\r\nshould do all we can to protect the unfortunate man\r\n\r\nwho   is  employed  by  a  firm  which  goes  into\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. Only too often have we found  that  the\r\n\r\nemployees of such firms have been thrown  into  the\r\n\r\nstreet  not because of their own fault but  through\r\n\r\nadverse  circumstances  over  which  they  have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible argument in my mind that can be\r\n\r\nmade  against  this motion is that  some  creditors\r\n\r\nwould  say  we are favouring the employees  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of the creditors, but I do not think  that\r\n\r\nthis  argument  could hold water.  After  all,  the\r\n\r\ncreditor  can choose whether he will  or  will  not\r\n\r\ngive credit to the debtor, whereas the employee  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  a  position to do so.

As  a result of my Saturday  sessions,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have learnt that there are at the  present\r\n\r\nmoment groups of workers who have been waiting  for\r\n\r\nmore    than   eleven   months   for   their   pay.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, what has occurred is this - they were\r\n\r\nnot  paid for several months and finally they  left\r\n\r\nof  their  own accord the employment of an employer\r\n\r\nwho was not paying them; but it took the employer's\r\n\r\ncreditors  a  number of months before he  was  made\r\n\r\nbankrupt and the receiving order was made in May of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  although  they  themselves  left   his\r\n\r\nemployment  last December. In those  circumstances,\r\n\r\nSir,  those  poor  people have  not  been  able  to\r\n\r\nreceive any part of their salary and rank merely as\r\n\r\ncreditors  to receive pro rata parts of the  assets\r\n\r\nof  the firm when it is wound up. I feel, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthey  are deserving of the sympathy of this  House,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  happy to note that this  House  is  not\r\n\r\nquibbling  either about the increase from  $250  to\r\n\r\n$1,000.  $250 may have been appropriate during  the\r\n\r\ntime,  Sir, when you could get a cook for  $30  and\r\n\r\n$40 a month, but it is hardly appropriate now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy to note that the Assembly\r\n\r\nis  not  making any adverse comment in view of  the\r\n\r\nshort  notice  given.

I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the original grant under this head for\r\n\r\n1955  was in the neighbourhood of $4 millions.

The\r\n\r\nEstimates for 1955 had already been framed by  that\r\n\r\ntime,  and,  speaking  from memory,  I  think  $4.4\r\n\r\nmillions or $4.5 millions had been entered for  aid\r\n\r\nto  Chinese schools. It was then clear that further\r\n\r\nsums would be required for grants-in-aid to Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  but  that  the exact  sum  could  not  be\r\n\r\ndetermined  until  such time as we  knew  how  many\r\n\r\nschools would apply for full\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naid.  At  that time, only 22 schools, if my  memory\r\n\r\nserves,  had  applied.

It   was\r\n\r\nestimated that the amount provided in the Estimates\r\n\r\nwould,  in  all  probability, be  sufficient  until\r\n\r\nabout  June, depending upon the number of  schools\r\n\r\nwhich applied for full aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position is that some 80 schools out of\r\n\r\nover  200 schools in the city have applied for aid,\r\n\r\nand  this  extra  sum  is  required  to  bring  the\r\n\r\noriginal  provision  up to the amount  required  to\r\n\r\nprovide that aid to the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I refer\r\n\r\nto  item  No.  314?

The cost of the vessel  was\r\n\r\nestimated  at  $785,000. It could not be  estimated\r\n\r\nwith   any  greater  degree  of  accuracy   because\r\n\r\ndetailed  plans  had  not  been  prepared  and  the\r\n\r\nprecise  type  of  engine  required  had  not  been\r\n\r\ndecided upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders have now been called for the hull, and\r\n\r\norders have been placed for the engines - diesel oil-burning  engines - which will give this launch  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  speed.  The  cost  of  the  engines  is,\r\n\r\nspeaking from memory, close on $400,000. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na result of these tenders, it is now clear that the\r\n\r\nprovision originally estimated for the cost of  the\r\n\r\nhull   and   other   fittings  is   too   low,   by\r\n\r\napproximately  $215,000. The  question  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould continue with the building of this launch in\r\n\r\nview  of the increased cost has been most carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Council of Ministers, and it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided in all the circumstances of the  case\r\n\r\nthat it is an essential requirement for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

Rice  is  still  subject  to   special\r\n\r\nlicensing  to ensure that importers comply  with\r\n\r\nthe arrangements for turning over the Government\r\n\r\nstockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> I\r\n\r\nbeg to second the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2) of section 1 of the  Control  of\r\n\r\nImports and Exports Ordinance, 1950 (No.  43  of\r\n\r\n1950)  resolves  that  the  aforesaid  Ordinance\r\n\r\nshall continue in force for a further period  of\r\n\r\none  year  commencing on the  8th  of  December, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

There are, however, more than enough places for the children in any one year age group. There will be approximately 50,000 places available in first year primary classes, whereas the number of children aged 6 on 1st January, 1956, is about 40,000 and aged 7 on 1st January, 1956, is about 38,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) (i) 3,998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Approximately 2,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Yes.

The appointment of substitutes to receive allowances at the Social Welfare Department relieves the sick and the aged from the necessity to attend in person. Many persons already take advantage of this facility. In addition payment of Public Assistance Allowances has been undertaken in Pulau Tekong and the Western Islands for all cases regardless of their age or state of health. An experiment in decentralization of payments has been initiated, but to do this on a large scale would place a heavy burden on the public purse, since more staff would have to be engaged to undertake the extra work involved in making the payments and in the maintenance of duplicate records and a more elaborate accounting system. Proposals for extended decentralization will depend to a great extent on the recommendations of the I.L.O. expert on Social Security who has recently arrived in Singapore.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
