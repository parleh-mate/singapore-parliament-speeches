M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to\r\n\r\navail myself of this opportunity to make a statement on\r\n\r\nthe rice stockpile though I am sure that most of what I\r\n\r\nam going to say is already well known to hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockpile of rice is part of the Singapore\r\n\r\ndefence scheme and is maintained in the island to cover\r\n\r\nan  emergency.  I am sure hon. Members will  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  it is imperative that Government should be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  issue  rice to  the  public  and  to  the\r\n\r\nessential services in the event of any emergency either\r\n\r\nhere  or  in the rice producing countries which results\r\n\r\nin  a  temporary shortage of rice. I might add here  in\r\n\r\npassing  that  the Federation of Malaya  also  holds  a\r\n\r\nsimilar stockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic principle behind the stockpile is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   adequate  supplies  of  fresh  rice  are  always\r\n\r\navailable. It is necessary therefore that the stockpile\r\n\r\nbe rotated and this is achieved by requiring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimporters  of  rice for local sale  to  purchase  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  from  the  stockpile  on  a  ratio\r\n\r\ndepending on the grade of rice. The ratio is two to\r\n\r\none  for imported whole-grain rice and three to one\r\n\r\nfor broken rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be readily seen that the whole success of\r\n\r\nthis  stockpile  scheme  is  dependent  on  regular\r\n\r\nrotation  of  the stockpile to ensure freshness  of\r\n\r\nthe rice. A new scheme has been introduced recently\r\n\r\nwhich aims at a minimum off take from the stockpile\r\n\r\nof  2,500 tons per month. This will operate  for  a\r\n\r\ntrial period of four months. Most importers of rice\r\n\r\nhave  individually  undertaken  to  draw  from  the\r\n\r\nstockpile up to a total of 2,500 tons a month.  The\r\n\r\nprincipal   association  of   rice   importers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  also collectively  guaranteed  that\r\n\r\nofftake would not fall below the minimum figure  of\r\n\r\n2,500  tons per month. This measure of co-operation\r\n\r\nby  the  trade will assist both the trade  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a concession to those importers of whole grain\r\n\r\nThailand rice who have given this undertaking, they\r\n\r\nwill  be permitted to import up to three times  the\r\n\r\nquantity  which  they have undertaken  to  purchase\r\n\r\nfrom  the stockpile. Hon. Members will observe that\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  this concession is  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nstockpile obligations of the importers from two  to\r\n\r\none for whole grain and three to one for brokens to\r\n\r\na  flat  rate  of three to one. Additional  imports\r\n\r\nfrom  Thailand  and  from  other  sources  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the normal stockpile requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should conclude here by repeating that the\r\n\r\nstockpile  is operated strictly on a \"no profit  no\r\n\r\nloss\" basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, can the Minister give us\r\n\r\nthe  percentage  of rice which has deteriorated  in\r\n\r\nthe  stockpile?

In fact after I became Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  industry I tried to introduce other rice, that\r\n\r\nis,  Burma rice and Saigon rice, and we had trouble\r\n\r\nwith  importers here who were forced  to  take  the\r\n\r\nother  grades  of  rice.  However,  we  are  slowly\r\n\r\nputting into the market rice besides Thailand  rice\r\n\r\nbut  still the greater bulk of rice that Government\r\n\r\nholds  is  Thailand  rice  because  of  the  strong\r\n\r\nconsumer   preference.  China  has  only   recently\r\n\r\nentered into the rice market and the quality of the\r\n\r\nChinese rice, I am afraid, is still unknown to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as to its keeping qualities, and  so  on\r\n\r\nand  therefore Government has not thought of buying\r\n\r\nChina rice up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> Can the Minister inform us of\r\n\r\nthe quantity of the stockpile and the proportion of\r\n\r\nSaigon  rice  to  Thailand  rice  taken  from  that\r\n\r\nstockpile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

However,   the\r\n\r\nquantity  of Saigon rice released in proportion  to\r\n\r\nThailand  rice depends on the quantity of  holdings\r\n\r\nof Saigon rice by the Government stockpile. For the\r\n\r\nmoment, we have about 4,000 tons of Saigon rice and\r\n\r\nsince  it was of an earlier import date, we  wanted\r\n\r\nto   release   this   quickly   before   it   could\r\n\r\ndeteriorate. However, we came to an agreement  with\r\n\r\nthe merchants only yesterday that they will get  80\r\n\r\nper cent Saigon rice and 20 per cent Thailand rice,\r\n\r\nonly  for  such a period until the Saigon  rice  is\r\n\r\nfinished. I expect the Saigon rice will be finished\r\n\r\nin the course of the next month or so and then they\r\n\r\nwill get mostly Thailand rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT POLICY ON LOCAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Commerce and Industry)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.16 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though\r\n\r\nGovernment welcomes investment in the industrial  field\r\n\r\nfrom   individual  financiers  and  groups  with  large\r\n\r\ncapital  resources, Government feels that the time  has\r\n\r\ncome  when  the  people  as a  whole  should  not  only\r\n\r\ndirectly  participate  in but  also  benefit  by  their\r\n\r\ncountry's  industrial development. Government  realises\r\n\r\nthat  the working man and woman in Singapore has up  to\r\n\r\nnow  had  very  little  opportunity  or  incentive   to\r\n\r\nactively participate in the ownership of industries and\r\n\r\nto  benefit therefrom. Government therefore feels  that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  only  necessary but also the  duty  of  an\r\n\r\nelected  Socialist  Government to actively  assist  the\r\n\r\npeople in owning and opening some industries which  are\r\n\r\nprofitable  because they produce goods  needed  by  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of the population. Such ownership should\r\n\r\nnot  be  by  the  State with publie  funds  but  rather\r\n\r\ndirectly by the people on an individual basis  so  that\r\n\r\nevery individual shareholder benefits directly from the\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this purpose, Government proposes\r\n\r\nto  set  up a People's Sector in industry, and some  of\r\n\r\nthe  industries which produce goods needed by the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the people and are therefore  a  portable\r\n\r\nproposition will be reserved for this Sector  in  which\r\n\r\nat  least  51  per  cent of the shares  shall  be  held\r\n\r\nlocally.  Holding of these shares is intended  for  the\r\n\r\nworking man and woman on an individual basis or for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Industrial Promotion Board. No large local\r\n\r\nshareholding from this percentage will be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to organize the working man and woman for\r\n\r\nthe  new  role  of  industrial  ownership,  a  People's\r\n\r\nInvestment  Corporation will be set up with  shares  at\r\n\r\n$10  each  to  enable every working man  and  woman  to\r\n\r\nparticipate by owning at least one $10 share.

Government's\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Promotion Board will hold 2 per  cent,  and\r\n\r\noutside  manufacturers of cigarettes  of  only  popular\r\n\r\nbrands would be invited to contribute up to 49 per cent\r\n\r\nand  to  manufacture cigarettes of their popular brands\r\n\r\nand  to  supply the technical know how. If such outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturers are not willing to join in the  proposal,\r\n\r\nthe  remaining shares in the People's Cigarette Factory\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  up by the Industrial Promotion  Board.\r\n\r\nRestriction will be placed on the import of  cigarettes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas soon as the factory starts production. It is not the\r\n\r\nintention  of  Government to restrict the operation  of\r\n\r\nexisting  Singapore cigarette factories which  were  in\r\n\r\nproduction on the 13th August, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A People's Match Factory would be set up in which the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Investment Corporation would  be  invited  to\r\n\r\ninvest  49  per  cent along with 51 per cent  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Industrial Promotion Board.

Members that\r\n\r\nunless  radical changes in Government's economic policy\r\n\r\nare  undertaken quickly, time is running out for us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and soon we will be facing a situation  much\r\n\r\nworse  than what we have recently seen, in the form  of\r\n\r\ngangsterism, because of unemployment, and  other  anti-social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will recall that I outlined Government's\r\n\r\nadoption of a policy of selective protection for  local\r\n\r\nindustries  in  this House on the 13th of  August  this\r\n\r\nyear, when this Bill had its First Reading that day.  I\r\n\r\nstated  in  this connection that outside  manufacturers\r\n\r\nwishing to manufacture their products here will,  as  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  rule,  be required to come to  an  arrangement\r\n\r\nwith   the   local  manufacturer  or  intending   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer,  if any, of the same product  or  failing\r\n\r\nwhich  with  interested Singapore citizens.  I  further\r\n\r\nindicated that such an arrangement should either be  on\r\n\r\na  partnership basis with at least 49 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nshares  held by the local interest or on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nthe  local interest manufacturing under licence of  the\r\n\r\noutside manufacturer. If after a reasonable time  there\r\n\r\nis  a  lack of response from local interests or if such\r\n\r\nan  arrangement cannot be made to my satisfaction,  the\r\n\r\noutside manufacturer will be given permission to set up\r\n\r\nhis own undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might well be asked why Government considers it\r\n\r\nnecessary  at  this stage to introduce  legislation  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the manufacture of goods. The reason, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nsimple. It will be quite obvious that if protection  is\r\n\r\ngiven,  some outside manufacturers who up to  now  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  wide open market  may  suddenly  find\r\n\r\nrestrictions placed in their way. They would find  that\r\n\r\nthe local manufacturer who up to now was treated by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government as an orphan, would now  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to capture the Singapore market from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the operation of protection would act as an\r\n\r\ninducement  to  local capital to invest boldly  in  new\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprises because  they  could  now  hope\r\n\r\nthrough  Government's intervention to get a fair  share\r\n\r\nof  the  local market. Thus it is expected  that  large\r\n\r\nsums  will  henceforth be invested by local capital  in\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all this would be that some of the\r\n\r\noutside manufacturers who up to now have been satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  supplying Singapore from outside may either  have\r\n\r\nto  gradually give up the Singapore market or be forced\r\n\r\nto open a factory here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strong consumer preference in Singapore for\r\n\r\nimported  goods, these outside manufacturers opening  a\r\n\r\nfactory here and manufacturing their well known  brands\r\n\r\nand  marketing them in Singapore again,  could  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  tragic effect on local investors. Local investors\r\n\r\nwho  might have in the meanwhile invested huge sums and\r\n\r\nwould just be getting on their feet could suddenly find\r\n\r\nthe  whole  ground cut from underneath  their  feet  by\r\n\r\nthese outside manufacturers and their investment vanish\r\n\r\ninto thin air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no check was exercised to prevent this happening,\r\n\r\nwho would dare to take the risk and invest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, Government has had no powers to check or\r\n\r\ncontrol outside operators, especially from the sterling\r\n\r\narea,  from  opening factories here as  and  when  they\r\n\r\nliked,  provided  they  did not  make  big  demands  on\r\n\r\nimmigration control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is aimed at giving Government the\r\n\r\nnecessary powers to exercise such checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's aim at present is to ensure that all\r\n\r\nand  sundry are carefully selected before they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to come in. It is only equitable that where\r\n\r\na   local  industry  already  exists,  such   local\r\n\r\nindustry  should not be allowed to  be  swamped  by\r\n\r\noutside  manufacturers of the  same  product  whose\r\n\r\nsole reason for coming in at this stage would be to\r\n\r\n\"jump\"  the protection. However, as I have  already\r\n\r\nindicated, where there is no local industry and  no\r\n\r\nlocal  interest in the manufacture  of  a  product,\r\n\r\nthen the outside manufacturer will be welcomed with\r\n\r\nopen arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, control will be achieved by making\r\n\r\nit  a  condition  that  no  person  may  set  up  a\r\n\r\nmanufacturing concern here after the  13th  August,\r\n\r\n1958, without having first obtained a licence.  The\r\n\r\nissue  of a licence will not of course absolve  the\r\n\r\nlicensee  from  complying with the requirements  of\r\n\r\nany other written law in force. The licence will be\r\n\r\nissued  on  payment of a nominal fee which  is  not\r\n\r\ndesigned as a revenue measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As investment in a manufacturing process is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  considerable, it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  a licensee is not at  the  mercy  of\r\n\r\npoliticians more than is absolutely necessary. Thus\r\n\r\na  licence is made valid for 15 years and renewable\r\n\r\nthereafter for further periods of 15 years  at  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the Minister. Therefore, the licensee\r\n\r\nhas  a clear 15 years' run provided he fulfills the\r\n\r\nconditions  laid down in the licence. The  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  power to refuse  the  issue  of  a\r\n\r\nlicence  or  to  issue a licence  subject  to  such\r\n\r\nconditions as he deems fit. In case of such refusal\r\n\r\nthe applicant has no grounds to grumble, because he\r\n\r\nhas  not made his investment yet. However,  once  a\r\n\r\nlicence is issued it is Government's intention that\r\n\r\nthere  should be as little interference as possible\r\n\r\nwith  the  industry and the investor is assured  of\r\n\r\nthis  by  the fact that the licence is to be  valid\r\n\r\nfor 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision in the Bill for the Minister\r\n\r\nto  revoke  a licence if the conditions  stipulated\r\n\r\ntherein by the Minister are not complied with,  but\r\n\r\nin such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  the licensee is safeguarded by the provision\r\n\r\nthat the Minister is obliged to inform the licensee\r\n\r\nin  writing  of  such revocation  and  the  grounds\r\n\r\nthereof and the licensee has the right of appeal to\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court  against the Minister's  decision.\r\n\r\nUntil   the  High  Court  makes  a  decision,   the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister's revocation cannot be enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noticed that existing manufacturers on\r\n\r\nthe  13th  August,  1958, are exempted  as  regards\r\n\r\ngoods they have been manufacturing as on that date,\r\n\r\nbut  it  would  be in their interest to  apply  and\r\n\r\nobtain a certificate to that effect under clause 12\r\n\r\n(3)  so  that there could be no grounds for  doubts\r\n\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other aspect of the Bill is that enabling the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  grant  an exclusive  franchise  to  a\r\n\r\nsingle manufacturer by restricting to him only  the\r\n\r\ngrant  of  a  licence for a particular manufacture.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members  will  appreciate  that  it  will  be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult to lay down hard and fast rules as to the\r\n\r\ncriteria to be applied before any manufacturer  may\r\n\r\nbe  considered for the grant of such  a  franchise.\r\n\r\nEach  application for franchise rights will be most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarefully studied and must of necessity be  decided\r\n\r\non  its  individual merits. However, the underlying\r\n\r\nbasic principle that will be applied is whether the\r\n\r\nmanufacturer concerned will find it uneconomical to\r\n\r\noperate  having regard to the amount of his initial\r\n\r\ncapital outlay and the size of the local market  if\r\n\r\na  competitor  were  also to come  into  the  field\r\n\r\nintending to manufacture the same type of goods.  I\r\n\r\nshould  emphasise that the grant of a franchise  is\r\n\r\nnot  by  any means intended to restrict  or  stifle\r\n\r\nlocal competition but is a measure which should  be\r\n\r\navailable for use very sparingly and selectively as\r\n\r\nand  when  the  occasion arises. I can,  therefore,\r\n\r\nassure  the  House that the granting  of  exclusive\r\n\r\nfranchise rights will be kept to a minimum and will\r\n\r\nbe subject to very close scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, will also act as the instrument\r\n\r\nthrough   which   Government  could   enforce   its\r\n\r\nindustrial policy from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, getting away from the narrow confines of\r\n\r\nthe Bill to the broader policy announced recently by me\r\n\r\non  the  economic front, we have accepted the principle\r\n\r\nof  protection for our industries. This is a  departure\r\n\r\nfrom   the  timeworn,  shall  we  say,  half-truth   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the free port status of Singapore.  I  say\r\n\r\nthat it is a half-truth because it is a half-truth that\r\n\r\nhas  been  blown up by interested parties to an  extent\r\n\r\nwhere  it  has  come to be believed in as  if  it  were\r\n\r\ngospel  truth, but the fact is that Singapore  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  a perfectly free port, shall we say. We have  had\r\n\r\nrestrictions of all sorts. We have had restrictions  on\r\n\r\nthe  dollar  exchange.  We  have  had  restrictions  on\r\n\r\nexports of certain goods to certain countries laid down\r\n\r\nby  the United Nations, embargoes, and so on. An ideal\r\n\r\nfree port should be a trading community which would  be\r\n\r\noccupied  only  in trade or in matters  allied  to  the\r\n\r\ntrading activities of the place or in services  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity who are engaged in trade. An ideal free  port\r\n\r\nshould  have no restrictions whatsoever on immigration,\r\n\r\ncurrency, imports and exports. That would be  an  ideal\r\n\r\nfree  port but we are far from that. In fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot been an ideal free port to quite an extent, but  we\r\n\r\nhave maintained some sort of a semblance to a free port\r\n\r\nand  I  am  quite sure that if my policies are  applied\r\n\r\nselectively on protection, we will continue to function\r\n\r\nas  an entrepot trading centre without much loss to the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade and, at the same time, we will  be  able\r\n\r\nto   give  protection  and  thereby  bolster   up   our\r\n\r\nindustries. However, this policy of protection has  got\r\n\r\nto  be administered very delicately and with a balanced\r\n\r\noutlook  and there should be no fear of favouritism  in\r\n\r\nthe  carrying out of this policy. It is only then  that\r\n\r\nthe  policy  could work. In fact, since announcing  the\r\n\r\npolicy  and  setting up the panel, I have already  been\r\n\r\nswamped by various manufacturers' associations who  now\r\n\r\nfeel  that  they have the right to ask why I  have  not\r\n\r\nappointed  members  of manufacturers'  associations  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassociations on the panel. I have stood up  against  it\r\n\r\nand  told  them off that I am not going to  create  any\r\n\r\nvested  interest on that panel. I want independent  men\r\n\r\ncapable  of  exercising independent judgment,  not  men\r\n\r\nrepresenting  manufacturers - otherwise the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  will  come  forward and say,  \"Where  is  our\r\n\r\ninterest?\"  and  then  you have all  the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nsitting  round a table and quarrelling with one another\r\n\r\nand  you  will get nowhere. That is the thing that  the\r\n\r\nMinister has got to fight against in the application of\r\n\r\nthis  policy and if the Minister does not fight against\r\n\r\nthat, then I can assure the House that the whole policy\r\n\r\nmay end in Singapore losing a lot of its trade. The key\r\n\r\nto this policy is the application thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers' associations have come up to me and\r\n\r\nblithely  suggested  that I should  exclude  just  five\r\n\r\nwords from clause 12 (2) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to\r\n\r\nany  person who is engaged in the manufacture of  goods\r\n\r\non the 13th August, 1958, in respect of such goods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"in  respect  of  such goods\" - five  words.  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"Please delete those words,\" and I said, \"No.\" All they\r\n\r\nwant  is  that existing manufacturers should  be  given\r\n\r\ncarte  blanche  to manufacture anything  they  like.  A\r\n\r\ncigarette  tins manufacturer could then  come  to  some\r\n\r\nsort  of  an  understanding with an  outside  cigarette\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  and  manufacture cigarettes  and  torpedo\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  which I have  just  announced.  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"No,  but  we  are  not  going  to  touch   your\r\n\r\ninvestments in the field in which you have invested and\r\n\r\nin  which  you are producing.\" And that is  a  cardinal\r\n\r\nprinciple.  Do  not  touch  anybody  who  has   already\r\n\r\ninvested in some industry, but when it comes to  a  new\r\n\r\nline  of production, he is as much new as anybody else.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the main thing, that political pressure  will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome to bear on the Minister, whoever the Minister  may\r\n\r\nbe.  Favours will be asked and the Minister has got  to\r\n\r\nresist  it. If he resists it, then only will the policy\r\n\r\nbe a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, today Singapore is in a difficult\r\n\r\nposition and yet the people of Singapore are not  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  key to all their difficulties  lies  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation. Sometimes the newspapers use bigger\r\n\r\nheadlines about gangsterism than about a drastic change\r\n\r\nin  the  economic policy, even though  according  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  newspaper the protection of  industries  might\r\n\r\nhave  given rise to Sir Stamford Raffles turning  round\r\n\r\nin   his  grave.  Headlines  about  gangsterism  appear\r\n\r\neveryday in the papers - in the English papers at  least -but  it  is  time now that the people of Singapore  are\r\n\r\nmade  to realise that there must be drastic changes  in\r\n\r\nour  economy,  and  unless those  drastic  changes  are\r\n\r\ncoming on quickly and without delay, we are heading for\r\n\r\na bad time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appeal, Sir, to the Opposition that if they\r\n\r\nhave  got  good grounds for asking me to  consider  the\r\n\r\nBill going to Select Committee, I shall consider it but\r\n\r\nI  am  not  prepared to give way to any  dilly-dallying\r\n\r\nrequest. If there are good grounds, I shall be prepared\r\n\r\nto consider committing the Bill to Select Committee. If\r\n\r\nI have missed out certain important points, then I will\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to consider that, but if they are not very\r\n\r\nimportant  points,  then I say let  us  take  the  Bill\r\n\r\nthrough its Third Reading today and give the Government\r\n\r\nthe  necessary powers to enforce this policy as quickly\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.44 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it will be a great tragedy if\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is pushed through all stages today. I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest   that  this  Bill  be  committed   to   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. The main reason is this, that this Bill is a\r\n\r\ngreat departure from the free trade policy of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  has been maintained throughout the last century.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is this. It would be better if such  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasure  were  to come from a fully elected  Government\r\n\r\nand  not from the present colonial Government.  I  must\r\n\r\ndefine  why  I  say  it is a colonial  Government.  The\r\n\r\npresent Government runs under the Rendel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution which is a colonial Constitution with  its\r\n\r\nex-officio   and  Nominated  Members.   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  granted  us reforms  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\npushed  off very long. They should be implemented  very\r\n\r\nsoon. Then, Sir, if that is so, it is for the masses in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  interest  to  elect  a  Government  and  to\r\n\r\nformulate an economic policy which they want for  their\r\n\r\nown benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the free trade policy, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that Singapore is not  a  free  port\r\n\r\nwith  its  immigration control and  other  regulations.\r\n\r\nThat may be so but it is a free port as far as trade is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned.  The  growing  unemployment  and  all  these\r\n\r\nconsiderations have come about today after the  present\r\n\r\ncoalition  Government has come into power  since  April\r\n\r\n1955.  Have  they  not  at heart the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople - the  way  they are running  the  Government  and\r\n\r\ntheir  heavy  travelling expenditure which  could  have\r\n\r\notherwise been saved for the masses!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position has been that this novice\r\n\r\nGovernment - I must call it \"novice\" - has experimented and\r\n\r\nexperimented and has reached nowhere today.  Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  want  to push through the Bill. The Minister  has\r\n\r\njust  said  that  if valid grounds are given,  he  will\r\n\r\nthink  of  appointing  a  Select  Committee.  The  most\r\n\r\nimportant  reason is its departure from the free  trade\r\n\r\npolicy and when you are taking this measure, it is  the\r\n\r\npublic  who  should give their views before the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  such  as manufacturers, merchants,  traders\r\n\r\nand consumers. It is for them to express their views so\r\n\r\nthat they can be considered by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of protection for goods, the\r\n\r\nprotection  for what type of articles is not  disclosed\r\n\r\nin  this Bill at all. This might be disclosed when  the\r\n\r\nBill  comes  before the Select Committee and  then  the\r\n\r\npublic   can   give  their  views  very  freely.   Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I would suggest that Government should  not\r\n\r\nforce  this Bill through today but that it be committed\r\n\r\nto Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.46 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with\r\n\r\nconsiderable trepidation that I follow the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry, and the gentleman who I think is\r\n\r\nwell  qualified  to  be  a  prospective  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry. I would  like  to  preface  my\r\n\r\nremarks by saying that I would not like to say anything\r\n\r\ntoday which would prejudice the merits of this Bill.  I\r\n\r\nfully  agree with the Minister when he says that a  new\r\n\r\nunencumbered  approach  to  our  economic  problems  is\r\n\r\nnecessary - an  approach  not  blinkered  by  catchwords,\r\n\r\nslogans and phrases like \"free port\", \"free trade\",  in\r\n\r\na very quickly changing South-East Asia.

That  is fully understandable but  there  are\r\n\r\nfurther repercussions arising out of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was going to say, my first impression on reading\r\n\r\nthe  Bill was that it was reminiscent of the great days\r\n\r\nof  the East India Company when Queens granted to their\r\n\r\nsubjects  exclusive monopolies to exploit or  otherwise\r\n\r\nenrich the nation by having an exclusive preserve of  a\r\n\r\ncertain part of the world. Since we only have a  little\r\n\r\nisland, then we can only grant little concessions  like\r\n\r\nthe  exclusive  right to manufacture cigarettes,  soap,\r\n\r\nmatches,  toothpaste, toothpowder and other  essentials\r\n\r\nwhich people must buy. They are bound to give profit to\r\n\r\nwhoever manufactures them, particularly if you  have  a\r\n\r\nbenign  government  that  arranges  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncompetition  with  imported  manufacture.  But  I   was\r\n\r\nastounded to hear the Minister admit that he gave  only\r\n\r\na two-month period of consideration to this imaginative\r\n\r\ndeparture  from  normal industrial  trade  policies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to consider this point. The\r\n\r\nlicence  that is to be granted is for 15 years with  an\r\n\r\noptimistic renewal option clause of another  15  years.\r\n\r\nNow,  in 30 years time, I may be a very old man, and  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt  if I will be alive, whereas the system  that  we\r\n\r\nsee  existing  in  South-East Asia  and  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which is to come into being next  year  will\r\n\r\nstill be here, though I wonder if there will be such  a\r\n\r\nperson  known as the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nin  the  State of Singapore. That is beside the  point.\r\n\r\nThe  present Government can only give manufacturers  an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsurance of seven months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before that I do not want to have to say\r\n\r\nanything  in  the  course of this  debate  which  would\r\n\r\nchallenge the merits of this Bill because the Bill  has\r\n\r\nmerits. But I do urge the Minister to send this Bill to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  in order that the full  implications\r\n\r\ncan  be  considered. There is no need to hurry at  this\r\n\r\nlast  moment in a radical departure of economic policy.\r\n\r\nI would just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  to draw his attention to certain aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  just  to  show him, since he  has  more  or  less\r\n\r\ninvited  us  to give reasons for it to be committed  to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, why he should do  so.  There  are  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of provisions for which rules  must\r\n\r\nbe  made,  and he has provided for them in  an  omnibus\r\n\r\nclause  in clause 11. For instance, in clause  6,  this\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal, the Minister revoking a licence  and\r\n\r\ngiving grounds for his revocation and giving the  right\r\n\r\nof  appeal to the aggrieved licensee to the High Court.\r\n\r\nThe rules will have to be prescribed: the procedure and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  issues that will have to be placed before a  judge\r\n\r\non  whether  to  oppose  the policy  of  the  Minister,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  to  oppose or  revoke  the  Minister's\r\n\r\ndecision, the grounds on which these things have to  be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is most important though not provided for in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, are provisions to ensure the employment  of\r\n\r\nlocal people. Now, Sir, we all know that the purpose of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  not  to create a thriving  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to compete with Hongkong, Japan or  the  big\r\n\r\nindustrial countries in South-East Asia and  Asia.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  is  to  provide some form of local  industries\r\n\r\neven though it may not be competitive, and as efficient\r\n\r\nas  those  in  Hongkong, Japan,  India  or  China.  The\r\n\r\nessential goods listed by an economist today in one  of\r\n\r\nthe  English  newspapers  are  soap,  sweets,  matches,\r\n\r\ncigarettes  and  all  the  other  non-elastic  consumer\r\n\r\ngoods. You can eat the best sweets in the world or  Tai\r\n\r\nHong sweets; it will come to the same. It does not make\r\n\r\nany  difference. You can strike a match made in  Sweden\r\n\r\nor strike a match made in Singapore. It really does not\r\n\r\nmatter.  But  unless  we are really competitive,  these\r\n\r\nfactors  cannot  become  a significant  factor  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  life of South-East Asia because we  can  only\r\n\r\ngive  protection insofar as consumption by 1\u00bd  million\r\n\r\nsouls  in  Singapore  is  concerned.  We  cannot   give\r\n\r\nprotection for the consumption by 7 million  people  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation,  over  1  million   in   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories and 70 million in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all these factors must be carefully weighed and\r\n\r\nconsidered, and I recommend to the Minister that if the\r\n\r\nobject  is  to  create employment, then there  must  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  provision  in this  Bill  to  lay  down  an\r\n\r\nemployment  policy  because  the  object  is  to   give\r\n\r\nemployment  and nothing else. His answer  may  well  be\r\n\r\nthat there are sufficient immigration controls to bring\r\n\r\nabout the desired result without having it specifically\r\n\r\nset up in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these matters we will have to discuss. We want to\r\n\r\nhear  all  these things and we can best  hear  them  in\r\n\r\nCommittee,  not a Committee of the whole House  because\r\n\r\nthen we will have to rush through the Bill today but in\r\n\r\na  Select  Committee. Sir, at the  end  of  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading,  I  hope to catch your eye to move  that  this\r\n\r\nBill  be  sent  to  Select Committee  and  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister   will   indicate  that  he  is   sufficiently\r\n\r\nsatisfied to make my motion unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I would also like\r\n\r\nto  persuade  the  Hon, the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  not  to  push through the  Bill  through  the\r\n\r\nremaining  stages  today but to let  it  go  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. From what' he read out just now, it seems to\r\n\r\nme  that  he is suggesting a great change in the  trade\r\n\r\npolicy  of  Singapore which I feel is a good thing  but\r\n\r\nthen  it is only his side of the story. We do not  know\r\n\r\nthe  other side of the story and in a major change like\r\n\r\nthis,  we need time to study the Bill carefully  before\r\n\r\nwe  pass  it. That is why I am asking him to accede  to\r\n\r\nour request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.58 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nseldom  that  I can agree with the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar but in this particular debate I am bound to agree\r\n\r\nwith  him on the major point especially that this  Bill\r\n\r\nshould  be committed to Select Committee. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  informed us that the persons selected on the panel\r\n\r\nwere  those  who had nothing to do with the  interested\r\n\r\nparties. Therefore public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially  that  of the interested parties  should  be\r\n\r\nheard  in  Select Committee and maybe a policy  can  be\r\n\r\nformulated  in  respect of the control of  manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the lengthy and detailed statement made by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Commerce and Industry - and we know that\r\n\r\nhe  is  able and hard-working - the most important  point\r\n\r\nwhich  he has touched upon is the failure of the  local\r\n\r\nindustries which is only too obvious and now he  speaks\r\n\r\nof  opening up new industries. I wish the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry will inform this House how  many\r\n\r\nestablished industries have been forced to close  down.\r\n\r\nI  would  draw the attention of this House - and  I  have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  this very often - that the most important thins  to\r\n\r\nsolve  is  the  economic instability of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ntariff   imposed  at  the  Johore  Bahru  causeway   is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the development of local industries.  So\r\n\r\nunless  Government can assure this House  that  a  Pan-Malayan  economic policy can be formulated  to  include\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of Malaya Government  and  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nGovernment  whereby our products can be  considered  as\r\n\r\ntheir own, then our home market consisting of just  1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  people,  as the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has\r\n\r\npointed out, is too small for the establishment of  any\r\n\r\nnew   industry.  Already  the  old  industries   cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain  themselves and now we are talking  about  new\r\n\r\nindustries.  Therefore I wish the Minister  can  assure\r\n\r\nthis  House  that this Pan-Malayan economic  policy  is\r\n\r\nunder way, otherwise this Bill is only just a scrap  of\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.02 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmust  say that I have the greatest respect for the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Commerce and Industry for his grasp of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy, and especially his enthusiasm  in\r\n\r\nseeking  to  remedy  that situation.  I  think  he  has\r\n\r\nalready   appreciated  that  Singapore  is   too   much\r\n\r\ndependent  on its entrep\u00f4t trade and, in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing population and the increase in unemployment,\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  years to come we must have something - that  is  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of industries - to supplement that  economy.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill - the Control of Manufacture Bill -  is  one  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe steps which he proposes to extend to something like\r\n\r\na  quantitative  import control and a  customs  tariff.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Minister did say just now that it  is  not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  protect,  I  see here in the explanatory  statement\r\n\r\nthat  it is \"to protect the local manufacturer\".  There\r\n\r\nis  an  element of protection and no doubt the measures\r\n\r\nof protection will come later and that, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  indicated,  will be in the form of a  quantitative\r\n\r\ncontrol or a customs tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although the Minister has rightly diagnosed the\r\n\r\nill,  I think this is quite the wrong remedy and it  is\r\n\r\nbound  to  do  more  harm than good  to  Singapore.  As\r\n\r\nSingapore  now stands, the entrep\u00f4t trade is still  our\r\n\r\nmainstay  and  it  still  feeds  us.  Any  measure   of\r\n\r\nquantitative control or by a customs levy is  bound  to\r\n\r\nhave  repercussions  on  that entrep\u00f4t  trade.  We  are\r\n\r\nbound,   for  instance,  to  antagonise  our   existing\r\n\r\ncustomers   and   we  cannot  afford  to   have   their\r\n\r\nretaliation  in whatever form later on. As the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying goes, I think this is a case of slashing off the\r\n\r\nflesh  to  remove  a  minor sore.  Quantitative  import\r\n\r\ncontrol  or a customs levy is simply going to  take  it\r\n\r\nout of somebody's already existing business in the hope\r\n\r\nof  conferring some benefit on the other fellow who  is\r\n\r\nin  industry and whose interests the Minister thinks he\r\n\r\ncan  protect.  Many  hon. Members have  mentioned  that\r\n\r\nwhatever we aim to protect is only for one and  a  half\r\n\r\nmillion  persons.  You  cannot  even  protect  so  much\r\n\r\nbecause there are bound to be people who would not like\r\n\r\nto  buy,  for  instance, locally  produced  cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThere  is  only  a  very  small section  that  you  can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossibly  hope to protect and it would be, I  think,  a\r\n\r\nwiser  policy  to  isolate that and  give  it  whatever\r\n\r\nprotection  it deserves without disturbing the  overall\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  this entrep\u00f4t trade. We know,  Sir,  that,\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking, all sorts of controls will tend  to\r\n\r\nbreed  corruption and inefficiency and, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned, this Bill is so much dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nMinister's application and honesty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhimself that it is quite dangerous if the powers  which\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  proposes fall into less sincere  and  honest\r\n\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in this Bill, as the Minister has admitted\r\n\r\nhimself,  in  clause 4 (1), it already  breaks  a  very\r\n\r\ncherished  principle on which Singapore has  grown  and\r\n\r\nthrived,  and that is the principle of free  trade  and\r\n\r\nfree enterprise. This clause reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every application for a licence shall be made to the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the prescribed form and the Minister  may\r\n\r\nissue or refuse such licence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  I  think  the  object of the Bill  is  to  promote\r\n\r\nindustry and I do not know under what circumstances the\r\n\r\nMinister is likely to refuse a licence to manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Clause 5 (1) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may in issuing a licence impose such\r\n\r\nconditions  as  he  may think fit to  impose  and  such\r\n\r\nconditions shall be set out in the licence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  what sort of conditions does the Minister have  in\r\n\r\nmind?  Is  it  the  suitability of  the  place  or  the\r\n\r\nsuitability  of  the manufacture? Under existing  laws,\r\n\r\nthese  are governed by other laws. Perhaps the Minister\r\n\r\nhas in mind that the licensee should manufacture up  to\r\n\r\na  certain quota and that he should use a certain  type\r\n\r\nof machinery chosen for him by the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then clause 5 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When issuing a licence to engage in the manufacture\r\n\r\nof  any goods the Minister may undertake that for  such\r\n\r\nperiod as he may determine no further licence shall  be\r\n\r\nissued\r\n\r\nfor the manufacture of such goods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, the Minister may decide on preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment or even create a monopoly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in this Bill that those who have\r\n\r\nalready established business before 13th August,  1958,\r\n\r\nare  to  be exempted. In other words, these people  who\r\n\r\nhave  already  had their business and who are  exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Bill  would  also not be  entitled  to  this\r\n\r\ngenerosity of a franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have touched on controls this morning. We\r\n\r\nhave  also touched on the strategic stockpile of  rice.\r\n\r\nThis  strategic  stockpile is  everytime  running  into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties, and in any case it is a burden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non the taxpayer. It is an alternate boon and woe to the\r\n\r\ntraders  concerned. So controls, if they are  not  very\r\n\r\nnecessary,  should hot be imposed at all, and  in  this\r\n\r\ncase  I  think they are not necessary because they  are\r\n\r\naimed at benefiting only a very small portion and  they\r\n\r\nwill,  if  imposed,  have great  repercussions  on  our\r\n\r\nentrep\u00f4t trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nanyang Siang Pau of the 25th August has\r\n\r\nthis to say. I quote excerpts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If Singapore hopes to have any success in its policy\r\n\r\nof  protecting its industries without at the same  time\r\n\r\nseriously   hurting  its  entrep\u00f4t  trade,  the   first\r\n\r\nrequisite  must  be  to have the  co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  because Singapore's own  manufactures  and\r\n\r\nits imported manufactures which it is proposed to limit\r\n\r\nquantitatively or by a customs levy have  hitherto  all\r\n\r\ndepended  on  the  Federation as  its  chief  consuming\r\n\r\nmarket.  If  Singapore cannot get the co-operation  and\r\n\r\nsupport of the Federation whose consuming power is four\r\n\r\ntimes that of Singapore itself, whatever measures taken\r\n\r\nto  protect  its industries will just  be  a  waste  of\r\n\r\neffort.  We  question whether with  only  the  causeway\r\n\r\nseparating and Federation industries having such a  big\r\n\r\nconsuming   market   compared  with   Singapore's   own\r\n\r\nnegligible consumption anyone seeking investment  would\r\n\r\nnot at once reject the latter and invest in the former?\r\n\r\nTherefore, if the Federation would not regard our close\r\n\r\neconomic co-operation as being important because of our\r\n\r\npropinquity and exempt Singapore industries from import\r\n\r\ntax  or even concede a preferential treatment, we shall\r\n\r\nfind  it even hard to maintain our existing industries.\r\n\r\nTo  expect  new  industries in the circumstances  would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust   be   an  extravagant  hope.  If  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  not  first bend  their  efforts  toward\r\n\r\nremoving  this barrier and instead try to plan measures\r\n\r\nwhich  are  bound  to more or less  harm  our  entrep\u00f4t\r\n\r\ntrade,  in  order  to protect industries,  it  is  just\r\n\r\nabandoning the body and chasing the tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Chief Economic Adviser to the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, Dr Benham's calculations, Singapore's import\r\n\r\nof produce, foodstuffs, and industrial goods amounts to\r\n\r\nbetween  three and four billion dollars a year. Roughly\r\n\r\none-fifth  of this is retained for own consumption.  As\r\n\r\nmuch  as  two-fifths  of  this is  re-exported  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and the remaining two-fifths is re-exported\r\n\r\nto Indonesia and other neighbouring countries. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  Federation  takes from  Singapore  imports\r\n\r\nyearly at least 1\u00bd billion dollars. This amount  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant factor in our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore importers of foodstuffs and consumer goods\r\n\r\ninvariably   take  the  Federation's  and   Singapore's\r\n\r\nconsumption  together into calculation  in  determining\r\n\r\nwhat  and  how much to buy from abroad. Of  these  they\r\n\r\nestimate that the Federation will take 75 per cent to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore's 25 per cent. If it happens that  there  are\r\n\r\nintermittent demands from Indonesia, Thailand or  other\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, as is the experience for  quite\r\n\r\na number of years now, their usual method is to satisfy\r\n\r\nthese  demands from the stocks reserved for Singapore's\r\n\r\nconsumption  and  replace them  immediately  afterwards\r\n\r\nfrom abroad. This is the usual pattern of their trade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If  a  quantitative limit  were  imposed\r\n\r\nleading   to  this  advantage  being  lost,  Federation\r\n\r\ncustomers  of Singapore importers will seek  to  import\r\n\r\ndirect from origin suppliers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further if a custom's duty levy were imposed, goods\r\n\r\nthat are intended for the Federation must be considered\r\n\r\nto be exempt; but the storage of these goods whether in\r\n\r\npublic   or  private  warehouses  would  present   such\r\n\r\ndifficulties in administrative control as to create all\r\n\r\nsorts of problems resulting in an increase of cost  and\r\n\r\nthus  lowering the chances of the Federation  customers\r\n\r\nbuying in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Singapore has already lost quite\r\n\r\na  lot of entrepot business for quite a number of years\r\n\r\nto Indonesia, Thailand and other neighbours, because of\r\n\r\nthese  countries' policy of trading direct with  origin\r\n\r\nsuppliers, and if before we get the co-operation of the\r\n\r\nFederation we should pursue this protection policy with\r\n\r\nits  very  doubtful  purpose  and  lose  this  big  and\r\n\r\nreliable consuming outlet, it is in the ultimate simply\r\n\r\nnot a sensible step.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will also read to you extracts from the Sin\r\n\r\nChew Jit Poh of Monday, 8th September, 1958:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Those who say that the entrepot is slipping is\r\n\r\ntalking   nonsense.  Our  biggest  entrepot   is   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia. In 1955 the figure was 200,000,000. In  1956\r\n\r\nit  increased  to 230,000,000. In 1957 260,000,000.  In\r\n\r\nthe  first five months of 1958 it has already  amounted\r\n\r\nto 200,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sympathise with those who think we cannot entirely\r\n\r\ndepend on entrepot. But they must be very careful  when\r\n\r\nthey think of replacing the free status of this port by\r\n\r\na   protective  customs  tariff.  They  must  take   in\r\n\r\nconsideration the situation as a whole lest  they  have\r\n\r\nboth hands empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of customs tariff can easily lead to\r\n\r\na  preponderant stress on treasury revenue and lose its\r\n\r\noriginal   objective  of  protecting   industries.   By\r\n\r\nwhatever  method you use, the burden will fall  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will give rise to lobbying by the various\r\n\r\nindustries  and  ultimately benefit a small  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrialists   and  victimise  the  whole   consuming\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A protective customs tariff is only one of the many\r\n\r\nmethods  to promote industries. In order to avoid  this\r\n\r\naffecting  our  entrepot  trade  which  is  still   the\r\n\r\nmainstay  of  Singapore, we must first  try  out  other\r\n\r\nmethods  by  giving direct or other indirect assistance\r\n\r\nto the industries concerned. The cost will not be small\r\n\r\nbut  it  must  be recognised that revenue from  customs\r\n\r\ntariff are also borne by the people ultimately -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate interrupting the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  but I think I must rule that he is, in effect,\r\n\r\nreading somebody else's speech. The hon.

As it is, all that we\r\n\r\nhave  heard during the last five minutes is, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  in  effect, the speech of somebody else  not  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew:</b> Sir, this is in fact a translation\r\n\r\nby  myself and not somebody else's speech. They are all\r\n\r\nextracts  which  I think are relevant to  my  argument.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am nearly finishing and if you will  allow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme,  I  will  just  proceed with  another  one  or  two\r\n\r\nsentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"- and does not fall from the sky. From the\r\n\r\nstandpoint  of Singapore as a whole, any  other  method\r\n\r\nwould be better than a customs tariff in order that the\r\n\r\nstatus of a free entrepot may not be shaken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, Sir, unfortunately, that the Federation is not\r\n\r\ngiving  us  any  preference or it has refused  to  give\r\n\r\npreference\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  our  manufactures; but if we are  to  introduce\r\n\r\nsome  import  control, quantitative  or  otherwise,\r\n\r\nthen  the  articles just referred to like  matches,\r\n\r\nsoap  and  so on, we would eventually have  to  tax\r\n\r\nthose  which  are  coming out from the  Federation.\r\n\r\nWhether that is desirable or not I do not know, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think any customs control will have to encounter\r\n\r\nsome difficulty in Empire preference which is after\r\n\r\nall  reciprocal,  and it is sure to  intensify  ill\r\n\r\nwill  against us and they could retaliate  in  more\r\n\r\nways than one. So is it really worth while that  we\r\n\r\nshould pursue this measure at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is like this - somewhat similar to a\r\n\r\nstory  which I have just been told. The story  goes\r\n\r\nlike  this. There are two ladies travelling in  the\r\n\r\nsame  compartment of a train. The window was  open.\r\n\r\nOne   lady  said,  \"The  window  must  be   closed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise  I will freeze to death.\" The other  lady\r\n\r\nsaid, \"You cannot close the window, because if  you\r\n\r\ndo,  I  will  suffocate to death.  In  fact,  I  am\r\n\r\nequally sure of that and as a further precaution, I\r\n\r\nwill  demand  that the fan should also be  switched\r\n\r\non.\"  The  other  passengers said, \"No,  thank  you\r\n\r\nboth.  We are quite comfortable as we are.  If  you\r\n\r\nswitch  on the fan it will be too cold, and if  you\r\n\r\nclose  the window it will be too hot.\" So  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  position - what to do? I think the Minister,  in\r\n\r\nproposing  these protective measures, is  evidently\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Close the window, because we have  got  to\r\n\r\nprotect  this  lady from freezing.\" Now  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen   to  the  other  lady  is  that  she   will\r\n\r\nimmediately be suffocated to death, not to  mention\r\n\r\nthe  extreme  discomfort to the  other  passengers.\r\n\r\nWould  it  not be a more sensible thing to  isolate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  freezing lady than attempt to protect  her  on\r\n\r\nthat spot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any industry in Singapore which needs this\r\n\r\nkind  of protection cannot be big, because any  big\r\n\r\nindustry  cannot just depend on its local  turnover\r\n\r\nto  survive.  Therefore, I think it  will  be  more\r\n\r\njustifiable, if the industry is worthy of it, if  a\r\n\r\ndirect  subsidy  or direct protection  by  whatever\r\n\r\nother  measures  could be given to it,  instead  of\r\n\r\njeopardising the entire entrep\u00f4t trade in the  hope\r\n\r\nof  trying  to confer some benefit to just  a  very\r\n\r\nsmall section of the people. As other hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers have suggested, I hope that this Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe  committed  to  a Select Committee  and  studied\r\n\r\nfurther,  and I hope that eventually the Government\r\n\r\nwill  see  their way to withdrawing this  Bill,  as\r\n\r\nthey have already withdrawn the Luxury Tax Bill  on\r\n\r\nsimilar objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI think there is some merit in this Bill. All of us\r\n\r\nsay  that  Singapore is dependent on  its  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  but  must  we always be  dependent  on  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade? Can we not take a second line  and\r\n\r\nemulate the example of small island countries  like\r\n\r\nHongkong    and   embark   on   a   programme    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation? I certainly feel, Sir,  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  is work to be done and if it can be done  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  then  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should be given a chance.  If  there  is\r\n\r\nmoney  to  be made and the people of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nmake  it themselves, then we should allow Singapore\r\n\r\nto  make such money. In this world, everything must\r\n\r\nstart  on  a small scale. In places like Japan  and\r\n\r\nHongkong  which  only  started manufacturing  early\r\n\r\nthis    century,   they   must   start   as   small\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.  They must first  supply  their  own\r\n\r\nneeds,  but because labour is cheap and because  of\r\n\r\nother prevailing conditions they were able to start\r\n\r\nnot  only supplying themselves with the goods  they\r\n\r\nneeded  but  also exporting to countries  that  had\r\n\r\nbeen  exporting to them. And today I think Hongkong\r\n\r\nis  exporting to England the goods that England was\r\n\r\nat one time exporting to Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the merits of this Bill must be\r\n\r\nbalanced  with other points which we must  consider\r\n\r\nvery  seriously.  I feel that if we  can  keep  our\r\n\r\nentrepot    trade    and    yet    go    on    with\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, then I will want the two  assets\r\n\r\ninstead  of  one, but we will have to  go  on  very\r\n\r\ncautiously weighing every fact first before we make\r\n\r\nsuch  a move. When I look at this Bill, I see there\r\n\r\nare  quite  a  number of flaws and loopholes  which\r\n\r\nmust be plugged. It will involve the Government  in\r\n\r\na  great  deal  of work - licensing  new  factories,\r\n\r\nexempting  many  people, and issuing  certificates.\r\n\r\nThen I will be thousands of certificates to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissued, many licences for new factories. This  work\r\n\r\nalone is going to be tremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir; when we talk about\r\n\r\nmanufactures  offered for sale to the public,  even\r\n\r\nsmall  manufacturers come in. The man in the street\r\n\r\nwho probably manufactures a few bottles of sauce or\r\n\r\nsome sweets or toys on a very small scale will have\r\n\r\nto  come  and get his licence or his exemption.  It\r\n\r\nmay cause him a great deal of inconvenience and  it\r\n\r\nmay  take  him a long time to understand  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this, we want to keep our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade and at the same time encourage local\r\n\r\nmanufacture. Let us take the example of cigarettes.\r\n\r\nWe  will say that all cigarettes which come in must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  into  bond and be re-exported. Local cigarettes\r\n\r\ncan  be  manufactured and sold. But  you  must  not\r\n\r\nforget, Sir, that Johore is so very near and though\r\n\r\nlocal  cigarettes  are  on sale  some  people  here\r\n\r\nprefer the brands that are imported. They might  go\r\n\r\nover  to Johore to buy their requirements for their\r\n\r\nown consumption. That is a loophole that we have to\r\n\r\nlook after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will consider seriously the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that a Malayan customs union  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  best solution. I have heard it said that there\r\n\r\nshould  be a customs union not only for Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  but also to include such territories  as\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo,  Sarawak  and  Kuching;  and  if  we\r\n\r\nestablish that, our markets will be bigger at least\r\n\r\nwhen  we consider local consumption. That idea  was\r\n\r\nmooted   during  the  last  Area  meeting  of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Parliamentary Association there and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it should deserve support from this Assembly\r\n\r\nif ever such a move were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly feel that the points raised both by\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  and other speakers previous  to  me\r\n\r\ndeserve  deep  consideration, and  that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nshould  be sent to a Select Committee so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  who will be greatly affected by  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill be able to voice their opinions on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.34 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I have not been and am not a business man, but\r\n\r\nthe House certainly knows that the Nominated\r\n\r\nMember, Mr Tan Siak Kew, is a business man of\r\n\r\nconsiderable experience; so I would ask the House\r\n\r\nto take heed of what he has asked it to do, and\r\n\r\nthat is to send this Bill to a Select Committee for\r\n\r\nfurther consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, It is\r\n\r\nunfortunate, Sir, that not only are the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  not aware of our serious  economic\r\n\r\nposition  but  they  are  not  even  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  this Bill. The Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nAyer  talked  about discussing in Select  Committee\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  protection, when  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreference  at  all  to  protection  in  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nProtection  is  going  to be  carried  out  by  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  Administrative action.  Quotas,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, are going to be placed on imported goods\r\n\r\nunder  my  authority, the authority  which  I  have\r\n\r\nunder the Control of Imports and Exports Ordinance.\r\n\r\nCustoms  duties  are going to  be  imposed  by  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary under his authority  which  is\r\n\r\nderived  from the Customs Ordinance. This Bill  has\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do with protection as such.  The  only\r\n\r\nthing this Bill seeks to do is to protect the local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  from  being swamped  by  the  outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  of  well-known  brands,  because  the\r\n\r\noutside  manufacturer is going to lose his  market.\r\n\r\nUp to now, the outside manufacturer refuses to come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  and wants to employ outside labour to sell  his\r\n\r\ngoods  to  the  people of Singapore.  He  has  been\r\n\r\ncajoled,  he has been asked, he has been begged  by\r\n\r\nus  to  come  in. We have given him  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\npromises - pioneer industry status,  tax  exemptions,\r\n\r\nthis and that - but he says, \"No, I do not trust the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore and their politicians. I refuse\r\n\r\nto   come  in.\"  Then  some  time  later  a   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsays, \"Right, I dare to invest in this thing.\" He  puts\r\n\r\nup  $500,000 and manufactures something here.  Then  he\r\n\r\nsays, \"Now, will you give me protection?\" And you  say,\r\n\r\n\"Imports  from  outside  are prohibited.\"  The  outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer with Brand X, which is a well-known brand,\r\n\r\nthen  decides to come in and manufactures Brand X here,\r\n\r\nand  the  local  man who has invested, half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars   loses  his  investment  because  the  outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  has  a  well-known  brand  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nconsumers run to buy that brand. That is all that  this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to  protect - nothing else.  In  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, Sir, I am doubtful whether the principle  of\r\n\r\nprotection can be discussed, because there is  not  one\r\n\r\nclause in this Bill which talks of tariff protection or\r\n\r\nquantitative restriction protection. What have my  hon.\r\n\r\nfriends  from the Opposition side got to  show  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  about  their  knowledge  of  the  economics  of\r\n\r\nSingapore? During election time they go to the  country\r\n\r\nand  shout all sorts of things. Yet what are they going\r\n\r\nto  do  for this country? Is what they have said  about\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  which  is of vital importance,  all  their\r\n\r\nknowledge?   The   reference  to  protection   in   the\r\n\r\nexplanatory statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... It provides power to regulate the setting up\r\n\r\nof  industries  on a planned basis and to  protect  the\r\n\r\nlocal manufacturer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  to  protect the local manufacturer  from  the\r\n\r\nravages  of  outsiders who come in  to  cash  in  on  a\r\n\r\nprotected  market - I see now some hon.

The  world\r\n\r\nhas  changed - the  fact  must be  realised - and  we  must\r\n\r\nchange with the world. If we do not, we are going to be\r\n\r\nleft  behind.  Do they realise that or not?  There  are\r\n\r\npeople  of the old generation who believe in  going  to\r\n\r\nraces,  drinking in high society, and so on,  and  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Let us keep that century-old policy.\" The moment\r\n\r\nyou talk of a change, they are frightened, because they\r\n\r\nbelieve in a conventional world, a world in which  they\r\n\r\nhave been brought up. They do not understand that which\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

In my statement, Sir, last month to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  I  said, \"It is now approximately two  years,\r\n\r\nSir,  since  I gave an indication that some measure  of\r\n\r\nprotection  might  have  to be considered.\"  Sir,  this\r\n\r\npolicy  is  not a hasty one and the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  misunderstood me this morning.  This  policy  of\r\n\r\nprotection has been under consideration for  two  solid\r\n\r\nyears,   and   I   say   again,  that   after   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration,  Government has come to  the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat the principle of protection must be recognised for\r\n\r\nour  industries and Government will therefore  commence\r\n\r\ntaking  immediately  all necessary steps  to  implement\r\n\r\nthis  policy, and reference of this Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  is not going to stop Government from  giving\r\n\r\nprotection  to industries. This Bill merely deals  with\r\n\r\none  aspect  of  it, and that is to protect  the  local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer   from  being  swamped  by   the   outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  because of his well-known brand.  Nothing\r\n\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

That  was\r\n\r\nin  respect of the statement I made this morning on\r\n\r\nthe  people's sector of industry, and for the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  months I have been working pretty hard on  it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will come to it later. Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be best for me to answer the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member, Mr Tan Siak Kew, first  because\r\n\r\nhe  has  raised  the  most  points.  He  says  that\r\n\r\nprotection  by  quantitative  restriction   or   by\r\n\r\ntariffs  will  mean  taking it from  one  hand  and\r\n\r\ngiving  it to somebody else. That is precisely  the\r\n\r\npoint, Sir. It will take the profits and the  wages\r\n\r\nof  labour from the outside manufacturer  and  give\r\n\r\nthem to the man inside Singapore. It will also  cut\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of freight, because, for most  of  these\r\n\r\nproducts, the raw materials are drawn from Asia and\r\n\r\nthey  are carted all the way to Europe and America.\r\n\r\nNow  they  can  be carted to Asia and the  consumer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoods  will be produced here. So if any hon. Member\r\n\r\nhas  any  opposition to it, let  him  say  so  now,\r\n\r\nincluding the Member for Tanjong Pagar, if  he  has\r\n\r\nany, and I am sure he has not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Controls will tend to breed corruption and\r\n\r\ninefficiency,\" Mr Tan Siak Kew says, \"and it  will\r\n\r\nbe  dangerous  if  powers  fall  into  less  honest\r\n\r\nhands.\"   The  answer  is  with  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If   they  wish  to   elect   corrupt,\r\n\r\ninefficient and less honest men to fill these Front\r\n\r\nBenches, they are welcome to it. Let them have such\r\n\r\npeople.  Why should we bother about it? We  try  to\r\n\r\nprovide  laws  to  be  administered  by  efficient,\r\n\r\nhonest  and  incorruptible  Ministers  as  far   as\r\n\r\npossible.   If  the  people  of  Singapore   choose\r\n\r\notherwise, they are welcome to their choice. It  is\r\n\r\nnot for us to judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Are not you people part of the\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

In  fact,\r\n\r\nnothing  can  bind  a  successive  government  from\r\n\r\nchanging  its  mind. It is an enabling  clause  and\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to it. In fact, it is just one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclause in between others. I think undue stress  has\r\n\r\nbeen laid by the Opposition on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Siak Kew has quoted, Sir, the possible\r\n\r\nconditions  under  clause 5 (1).  The  condition  I\r\n\r\nthink would be not on the amount of protection  but\r\n\r\nrather that the local manufacturer should not  come\r\n\r\nto  an arrangement with any foreign manufacturer in\r\n\r\nwhich  he  holds less than 49 per cent.  Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a  small  man  making,  say,  a  thousand\r\n\r\ncigarettes a day. The foreign man comes in  because\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  bring his cigarettes in. And  he  says,\r\n\r\n\"Look  here,  I  will  pay $500  a  month.  Let  me\r\n\r\nmanufacture  cigarettes here.\" So the  foreign  man\r\n\r\n\"jumps\"  the  protection, comes here to manufacture\r\n\r\nhis cigarettes and then tells the Government, \"I do\r\n\r\nnot  care tuppence for you!\" And that is where  the\r\n\r\nrestrictive  conditions will come in.  You  give  a\r\n\r\nlicence to the local man but he cannot come  to  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  with a foreign manufacturer  without\r\n\r\nthe  permission of the Minister, and  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  see that the local man gets a fair share  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not an eyewashing arrangement for  the\r\n\r\noutside  man  to come in and \"jump\" the  protection\r\n\r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the articles in the Nanyang Siang Pau and\r\n\r\nthe  Sin Chew Jit Poh were quoted. I think  it  was\r\n\r\ngood  that they were quoted. I have read these  two\r\n\r\narticles with interest and I do not think there  is\r\n\r\nany  merit in both of them. \"The Federation is  the\r\n\r\nchief  consuming market - four times  the  market  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"   That   is  not  correct,   Sir.   The\r\n\r\npopulation of the Federation is four times that  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, but the consuming power of Singapore  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to that of the Federation is  40  to  60,\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore is an urban community and we have\r\n\r\na   higher  purchasing  power  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  is  mainly a rural community,  and  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  power is less. Therefore the  consuming\r\n\r\nability   is  40  for  Singapore  to  60  for   the\r\n\r\nFederation - not 20 to 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since Singapore is a negligible market, would it\r\n\r\nnot  be  that most investors would reject Singapore\r\n\r\nand  go to the Federation?\" That is precisely  what\r\n\r\nhas  happened. Factory owners who were about to  go\r\n\r\nto the Federation stopped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  their  tracks when I made the statement  about\r\n\r\nprotection last month. It has been going on  since\r\n\r\nthe  last one year. Factories have shifted to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. They have had to close down because of\r\n\r\nthe   tariffs,  but  the  moment   I   made   this\r\n\r\nannouncement,  they  stopped  and   we   are   now\r\n\r\nretaining  these  factories.  They  are   thinking\r\n\r\ntwice - and yet, Sir, we are told about century-old\r\n\r\npolicies and asked to think about it. By the  time\r\n\r\nyou  think about it, you will have lost  all  your\r\n\r\nfactories.  Nothing will have been  left  here  to\r\n\r\nthink about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Benham was quoted by the Nanyang Siang Pau - \"two-fifths of the foodstuffs go to the\r\n\r\nFederation.\"  Exactly,  Sir,  and  I  have  in  my\r\n\r\nstatement  made  it  very  clear  that  \"under  no\r\n\r\ncircumstances will the operation of protection  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to interfere in any way with the entrep\u00f4t\r\n\r\ntrade  in  produce, processed produce and textiles\r\n\r\nor  raw  materials\".  We are not  going  to  touch\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs and such things, Sir. We are only going\r\n\r\nto touch consumer goods and it might interest hon.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition to know this - if  at  all\r\n\r\nthey  study such things, which I do not think they\r\n\r\ndo,  because  most  of them,  especially  my  hon.\r\n\r\nfriend  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar, study  only\r\n\r\nslogans to catch the political ears of the people.\r\n\r\nBut as to the economic aspect, I do not think they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  an economic policy, because they have  never\r\n\r\nannounced it. Sir, about 70 to 75 per cent of  our\r\n\r\ntrade   is  in  these  items -  Arecanuts,   canned\r\n\r\npineapples, sago, sugar, raw coffee, tea,  cloves,\r\n\r\npepper,  cigarettes, copra, rubber, jelutong,  gum\r\n\r\ndammar,  aviation spirit, kerosene,  liquid  fuel,\r\n\r\npalm oil, coconut oil, tapioca flour, cotton piece\r\n\r\ngoods,  artificial  silk  piece  goods,  tin.   It\r\n\r\nvaries. In 1951 it was 86 per cent. In 1956 it was\r\n\r\n74  per  cent. In 1957 it was 70 per cent.  Nearly\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of our entrep\u00f4t trade is not in the\r\n\r\nconsumer  goods which are going to be affected  by\r\n\r\nprotection.  It is in these produce  and  textiles\r\n\r\nand  processed goods and therefore the  fear  that\r\n\r\nour   entrep\u00f4t  trade  is  going  to  suffer,  and\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs - \"two   fifths   of   it   go   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation\" - are going to suffer, is unfounded  and\r\n\r\ndue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-understanding on the part of the  persons  who\r\n\r\nmake these suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Storage may be a problem.\" Bonded warehouses\r\n\r\ncan  overcome  this problem. Other countries  have\r\n\r\ndone it. Why cannot we do it? Then the hon. Member\r\n\r\nquotes again, \"Singapore has lost business in  the\r\n\r\npast  due  to  the  direct trading  activities  of\r\n\r\ncountries  like Indonesia and Thailand.\"  Exactly,\r\n\r\nthat is what I have been telling the House for the\r\n\r\nlast  two  years, and that is why we have  got  to\r\n\r\nopen our eyes and do something about it - so that we\r\n\r\nwill  have something to fall back on when we  lose\r\n\r\nmore  of  our entrep\u00f4t trade - and that  is  coming - \r\n\r\nbecause in this present competitive age no country\r\n\r\ncan afford to go to a middleman if it can help it.\r\n\r\nThat means that if direct trade progresses, we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  to get less trade, which means that  unless\r\n\r\nwe  do  something on the industrial front  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  in  a jam. I give figures - the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember's  figures were all for single months,  but\r\n\r\nhere are the comparisons. In 1955 our imports were\r\n\r\n2,865,000,000 - it  is  not  just  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nfigures  we  have got to see, but  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  imports  and  exports,  the  balance   of\r\n\r\npayments. Our exports were 2,781,000,000. In  1956\r\n\r\nthere   was  a  jump  in  imports -  3,098,000,000;\r\n\r\nexports remained almost the same at 2,732,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn  1957  imports were 3,277,000,000 - a jump  again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  the  previous year; exports remained  almost\r\n\r\nthe   same - 2,773,000,000.  The  result  is  that\r\n\r\nwhereas  exports have remained stagnant at  around\r\n\r\n2,700,000,000,  imports have kept  on  jumping  by\r\n\r\nroughly  200  million  a year.  The  gap  from  84\r\n\r\nmillion in 1955 went up to 365 million in 1956 and\r\n\r\n504  million  in  1957; and  that  is  the  danger\r\n\r\nsignal.  As  the imports increase, it  shows  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  more consumption at home, and  even  if\r\n\r\nemployment is a criterion - and employment is a  big\r\n\r\ncriterion, I will admit - it should not be the  only\r\n\r\ncriterion.  We have got to produce more  at  home,\r\n\r\nnot  only just to find employment, but to cut down\r\n\r\non  our  imports, because very soon you will  find\r\n\r\nthat you will not have enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney to import goods. Now our dollar is a dollar which\r\n\r\noperates in a whole area, but supposing later on with a\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank in the Federation or something  else  you\r\n\r\nfind  that you have to rely on your own prestige,  your\r\n\r\nown  economy - not  on one that is bolstered  up  by  the\r\n\r\neconomies of surrounding countries like Malaya, Borneo,\r\n\r\nSarawak - then you will find that your Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nwill  start fluctuating, if this state of affairs  goes\r\n\r\non.  You have got to see that you import less and  make\r\n\r\nwhat  you can at home. The same story continues  during\r\n\r\nall  the  months  this  year, if hon.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition care to read the statistics, which  I  doubt\r\n\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another false argument, that is that the burden\r\n\r\nwill  fall  on the shoulders of the people. That  means\r\n\r\nthe  cost of living will go up. That is not so, because\r\n\r\nmost   of   the  goods  that  you  consume   here   are\r\n\r\nmanufactured in Europe or America, and labour there  is\r\n\r\nas high as, if not higher than, in Singapore. Therefore\r\n\r\nyou save on the cost of labour because Singapore labour\r\n\r\nis  cheaper.  You also save on freight. In many  cases,\r\n\r\nyou  save  on exorbitant profits made by these  outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturers because of their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it desirable to have a tax on articles coming from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation?  The  Federation  has  decided  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  have  a  tax  on  articles  coming  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would like to ask the mercantile\r\n\r\nmind how this really helps him in the argument. He says\r\n\r\nlabour  is cheaper here. Then we dispense with freight.\r\n\r\nTherefore  the cost of living will go down. But  to  my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-mercantile mind, it appears to me that if  that  is\r\n\r\nin  fact  the argument, then protection is unnecessary,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  would be able to compete with the  outside\r\n\r\ncommodity.

Government will give, say, a  direct\r\n\r\nsubsidy  of $20 million to industry to keep  the  trade\r\n\r\nopen.   For   whose  benefit?  So  that   the   outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer can push his goods in and make his profits\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore market; and the Government  collects\r\n\r\nfrom  the taxpayer, through other methods, and gives  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy to local factories? Now, is that the right  way\r\n\r\nof  doing things? You tax a local man, to pay  a  local\r\n\r\nfactory, and you let the outside man make his money  on\r\n\r\nit. Is it not fairer for the outside man to be made  to\r\n\r\npay or to be stopped?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a customs union with the Federation would be a\r\n\r\nvery good idea, but I do not think it is practicable in\r\n\r\nthe  political field as yet. If we could  have  a  Pan-Malayan  economic  system,  that  would  be  the   most\r\n\r\ndesirable thing; but as hon. Members know, it  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved.  Even  India, Sir,  has  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  prevent  outside  manufacturers   from\r\n\r\nopening factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now come to the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar. He has not got any really good argument why this\r\n\r\nBill  should  go to Select Committee. I  suspect,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat he is trying to gain time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is not aware of the implications  himself.\r\n\r\nBut  if the hon. Member, as he always professes to  be,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  on  the  side of where the good of Singapore  lies,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  he should not advocate any delay  in  the\r\n\r\npassing of this Bill, because it is designed to  assist\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore man. And the reply I made earlier  about\r\n\r\ntwo months' consideration did not apply to this Bill or\r\n\r\nto  the protection policy, but only to the statement  I\r\n\r\nmade  this  morning. He drew attention to  one  or  two\r\n\r\nclauses.  He  says the judge will have  to  approve  or\r\n\r\nrevoke the decision of the Minister on policy. That  is\r\n\r\nnot  true.  The judge will have to decide on  the  case\r\n\r\npurely on factual grounds, whether the conditions  laid\r\n\r\ndown  by the Minister have been observed or not - not  on\r\n\r\nthe policy. The Minister can revoke a licence if he  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the conditions which he has imposed have\r\n\r\nnot been complied with, and the man can go to the Court\r\n\r\nand  say, \"I have complied with the conditions, but the\r\n\r\nMinister is not satisfied and has revoked the licence.\"\r\n\r\nThe  judge  then  has  to  rule factually  whether  the\r\n\r\nconditions have been complied with. It is a decision on\r\n\r\nfacts,  not  on  policy. Policy is  a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister, not for the judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provision to provide for employment\" - you cannot\r\n\r\nprovide in any law provisions for so much employment to\r\n\r\nbe  given  and  that sort of thing.  That  is  a  fluid\r\n\r\nmatter. Some industries can give more employment;  some\r\n\r\ncan give less; but you cannot force anybody to give  so\r\n\r\nmuch employment, because then it will not be a business\r\n\r\nproposition.  But as I say, it is not  only  employment\r\n\r\nthat  I  have in mind, but also the creation of  wealth\r\n\r\nhere by additional productivity and the cutting down on\r\n\r\nimports, and the retention of that portion of the value\r\n\r\nof the goods consumed here which accrues to the outside\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  through the wages paid to labour.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that we can give protection only for the Singapore\r\n\r\nmarket, but an industry is like an infant - you have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  it  a helping hand when it first learns to  walk.\r\n\r\nOnce  it  can walk by itself, it can learn  to  run  by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitself.  If you can give an industry a helping hand  in\r\n\r\nthe  initial stages by giving it a market - even  though\r\n\r\nit  may  be small - on which it can rely, then  you  will\r\n\r\ngive  it an opportunity of expanding later and entering\r\n\r\na  foreign market. But let me assure hon. Members this.\r\n\r\nWhile  we are having compunctions about protection  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nputting  up  barriers here, other countries  have  gone\r\n\r\nright  ahead. Sarawak has recently raised the  duty  on\r\n\r\nsoap,  and  when  the  local  manufacturers  wrote   to\r\n\r\nSarawak,  they said, \"Sorry, that is our  policy.\"  And\r\n\r\nhere we are, thinking a hundred times about retaliatory\r\n\r\nmeasures  against us. The Ottawa Agreement of 1932  set\r\n\r\nup  preferential  treatment  between  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries.  Is  that  not  the creation  of  protective\r\n\r\nmeasures  for  countries in the  Commonwealth?  Anyhow,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do not admit that any valid argument has  been\r\n\r\nput  up for sending this Bill to Select Committee,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  I do not want to come in the way of democratic\r\n\r\nprocedure, I have no objection if the Bill is  referred\r\n\r\nto a Select Committee.

I propose in  this\r\n\r\nspeech  merely  to  refer to the intention  behind  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill without reference to particular\r\n\r\nclauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is designed to be a small one of five\r\n\r\nmembers  who  would  not  be representatives  of  other\r\n\r\nbodies   or  authorities,  and  who  would   be   paid.\r\n\r\nMembership  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  is  made  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisqualification as is service with the Government or a\r\n\r\nlocal  authority  within one year before  the  date  of\r\n\r\nappointment. The purpose of these measures is to secure\r\n\r\nan independent Board which could he responsible only to\r\n\r\nGovernment  and would carry out public policy  as  laid\r\n\r\ndown by Government. For this purpose also, the Board is\r\n\r\nrequired  to submit for approval all its proposals  and\r\n\r\nalso  to fix rents for housing accommodation only  with\r\n\r\nthe approval of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is further empowered to give the Board directions of a general nature not inconsistent with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other usual methods of control are also prescribed in\r\n\r\nthe Bill, including the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement  for the Board to submit an  annual  budget\r\n\r\nfor  approval by the Minister, to seek the Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil's   approval  for  loans  and  the  terms   for\r\n\r\nrepayment  of  such loans, and to submit  accounts  for\r\n\r\naudit by an Auditor nominated by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to these controls, it is intended that the\r\n\r\nBoard  should  be free to run its own  affairs  and  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  its projects in the manner it thinks  best.\r\n\r\nThe Board will be allowed to pursue its own operational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  and all questions regarding such policy  should\r\n\r\nbe   dealt   with  through  its  own  public  relations\r\n\r\norganisation. The allocation of housing should not be a\r\n\r\npolitical issue. The Board will have control of its own\r\n\r\nfinancial  affairs,  subject to the  overall  financial\r\n\r\napproval and the grant of an annual Government  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  and it would be run on business  like  lines,\r\n\r\nbalancing  its  own income and expenditure  within  the\r\n\r\nframework of an agreed subsidy policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the Board should be made the\r\n\r\ncompetent  planning authority in new town areas  or  in\r\n\r\nareas of comprehensive development so that it would not\r\n\r\nbe  subject to planning control by the local authority,\r\n\r\nbut  it would be required to observe the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Master Plan. Local authority by-laws are also made\r\n\r\ninapplicable  to  the  Board.  It  will  be  necessary,\r\n\r\nhowever, for the Board, as at present, to retain proper\r\n\r\nliaison,  consultation and agreement with other  bodies\r\n\r\nin  order  to  enable  them to  gear  their  activities\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system will be continued whereby\r\n\r\nGovernment   acquires  compulsorily  under   the   Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  Ordinance  any  land  required   for   its\r\n\r\nprojects,  which  it has power to  but  cannot  buy  by\r\n\r\nprivate treaty. The Board is also given power, with the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the Minister, to sell, lease,  surrender,\r\n\r\nmortgage, exchange or otherwise deal with its land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will appoint a paid Chief Executive Officer\r\n\r\nin   charge  of  various  departments  (administrative,\r\n\r\narchitectural,  engineering,  housing   valuation   and\r\n\r\nfinance).  The running of the Board could be  left,  by\r\n\r\ndelegation  of authority from the Board, to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive   Officer   and  other  executive   officials\r\n\r\nwherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent policy of the Board will be dictated by\r\n\r\nthat  laid  down in the Government White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nHousing  Subsidies. The Authority  would  calculate\r\n\r\neconomic  rent  taking  into account,  among  other\r\n\r\nmatters,  the  cost of land, preparation  of  site,\r\n\r\nlegal  fees, administrative charges and fees, rates\r\n\r\nand  taxes,  loan charges, repairs and maintenance.\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  decide, as a matter  of  policy,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  portion  of income could be appropriated  for\r\n\r\nrent in the various income groups and the level  of\r\n\r\nrents which should be charged for various types  of\r\n\r\naccommodation in respect of each block of houses or\r\n\r\nscheme, having regard to the type of person  likely\r\n\r\nto occupy them. Government would then pay annually,\r\n\r\nby  vote  in the Estimates, the difference  between\r\n\r\nthe economic rents and the rents derivable from the\r\n\r\nimplementation of Government policy, thus  enabling\r\n\r\nthe  Board to balance its housing account  annually\r\n\r\nand retaining in the hands of the Assembly power to\r\n\r\ncontrol rents and vary the rate of subsidisation of\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the control of rents exercised by\r\n\r\nGovernment under the above policy, it is considered\r\n\r\nunnecessary  that  the  2,000  pre-war   properties\r\n\r\nshould be subject any further to the protection  of\r\n\r\nthe  Control of Rent Ordinance. With regard to  any\r\n\r\nsuggestion of discrimination between the Trust  and\r\n\r\nother  private landlords, it should be  noted  that\r\n\r\nthe   Trust   has  standards  of  supervision   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance which private landlords do not  attempt\r\n\r\nto provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial procedure of the Board is\r\n\r\ndetermined also by the statement of policy set  out\r\n\r\nin the White Paper on Housing Subsidies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would supply funds at current\r\n\r\nrates of interest and periods of repayment in  each\r\n\r\ncase,  i.e. 60 years for permanent buildings, less,\r\n\r\nperhaps 20 years, for others. As at present,  funds\r\n\r\nwould be advanced in instalments as required on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of programmes approved by the Assembly.  The\r\n\r\narrangements  would  be purely  commercial  and  in\r\n\r\naccordance with accepted practice in such matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be necessary, in order that information\r\n\r\non the financial position of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Trust  may  be easily ascertainable,  for  the\r\n\r\nTrust  to keep capital expenditure accounts  and  a\r\n\r\nhousing income and expenditure account which should\r\n\r\nbe  in  balance each year, with the annual  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy providing the balancing factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated the intentions of Government at\r\n\r\nsome length because it is necessary to explain  why\r\n\r\nthe Bill has been drawn up in its present form.  It\r\n\r\nis  possible  that hon. Members may not  all  agree\r\n\r\nthat  these are quite the best provisions  for  the\r\n\r\norganisation of the Housing and Development  Board,\r\n\r\nand  in  matters of detail, the Government will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to listen to any suggestions hon.  Members\r\n\r\nmay  wish  to bring forward. Indeed, I have  myself\r\n\r\nalready  received certain suggestions for amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  I have accepted and included in a notice  of\r\n\r\namendment.

The duties of the Board are set\r\n\r\nout in clause 12 of the Bill, which clause reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject as hereinafter provided, it shall be the\r\n\r\nfunction and duty of the Board -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to prepare and execute proposals, plans and\r\n\r\nprojects for -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the erection, conversion, improvement and\r\n\r\nextension of housing or other accommodation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the clearance and redevelopment of slum\r\n\r\nareas;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the development or redevelopment of areas\r\n\r\ndesignated by the Minister;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the development of rural or agricultural\r\n\r\nareas  approved  by  the  Minister  for   the\r\n\r\nresettlement   of   persons   displaced    by\r\n\r\noperations of the Board;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to manage all lands, houses and buildings or other\r\n\r\nproperty vested in or belonging to the Board;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to carry out all investigations and surveys\r\n\r\nnecessary for the performance of the functions and\r\n\r\nduties of the Board;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to do all such other matters and things as are\r\n\r\nnecessary for the exercise or performance  of  all\r\n\r\nor any of the functions and duties of the Board.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  trust  that  by the separation of these  duties  the\r\n\r\nBoard will be able to concentrate on producing not only\r\n\r\nmore  houses,  but more houses for the same  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  which has been spent in the past, and  that  the\r\n\r\nprogramme will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreak down as it had done during the past two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we see improvement in the urban areas from the\r\n\r\nlarge number of flats that have been erected, there is\r\n\r\nmuch room for development of the urban districts, which\r\n\r\nhas hardly begun. There is provision in the Master Plan\r\n\r\nfor  satellite towns at Serangoon, Woodlands and Bulim,\r\n\r\nbut  these satellite towns will take a long, long  time\r\n\r\nto  build and put into operation, and it will cost such\r\n\r\na  tremendous amount of money which we cannot  see  how\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to find in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now heavy commitments due to the education\r\n\r\nand  social  services. I would recommend to the  Board,\r\n\r\ninstead  of trying to build houses in these  areas,  to\r\n\r\nacquire the land where these towns are situated, cut up\r\n\r\nthe   land  into  small  lots  after  providing  roads,\r\n\r\nservices  and sewers, and sell them to the  public,  so\r\n\r\nthat  this  land  can  either be developed  by  private\r\n\r\ninvestors  or the houses can be built by the purchasers\r\n\r\nof  the  land  according  to  their  needs.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nimpossible task for Government to try to put  up  three\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns - or even one or two satellite  towns - as\r\n\r\nwell as develop the houses planned in the City area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a much more urgent and vital duty the Board\r\n\r\ncan  now perform is to try to control and encourage the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  areas which are  now  already  heavily\r\n\r\nsettled,  like villages in various parts of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese  areas can now be developed at a minimum  expense\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  can  be  done so rapidly that the  population  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  by  such development. Actually, in some  areas\r\n\r\nthe  position has entirely got out of hand. In some  of\r\n\r\nthese  villages,  so  many  houses  have  been  erected\r\n\r\nwithout  submission of plans, or so  many  houses  have\r\n\r\nbeen extended, one towards the other, that there is now\r\n\r\nno room at all for any further planning or development.\r\n\r\nThe  houses  touch one another. There is no possibility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  building roads without tearing apart some of  these\r\n\r\nhouses;  and  there is also a danger  of  fire  because\r\n\r\nthere   are  no  fire-lanes.  There  is  no  sanitation\r\n\r\nwhatever;  there are no drains and all the  sewage  and\r\n\r\nwater runs downhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other villages, quite a big number of\r\n\r\nthem,  where there is still land, sufficient  space  in\r\n\r\nbetween the houses for development to be undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Trust - by the acquisition of these hundreds\r\n\r\nof  acres  of  land straightaway and  having  a  proper\r\n\r\nlayout  made  so  that the roads and  services  can  be\r\n\r\nprovided - the plots can be sold to the owners of  houses\r\n\r\nwho are already on that land. I have gone through quite\r\n\r\na  number of villages. I have spoken to the people  and\r\n\r\nthey  say  they are very anxious to be able to  possess\r\n\r\nthe  land on which they live, and I know very well that\r\n\r\nthey can pay, not enormous sums because it will not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Landlords,  many landlords,  are  only  too\r\n\r\nanxious  to  get  rid of this land at  very  reasonable\r\n\r\nprices because they know that at the present moment, in\r\n\r\nthis   present  era,  they  can  never  obtain   vacant\r\n\r\npossession.  Here,  then,  is  a  chance  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndesperate housing shortage in a very short time, and  I\r\n\r\nwould sincerely urge the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands and Housing to consider this point of view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will find it increasingly difficult to get\r\n\r\nthe  funds which the S.I.T. has obtained throughout the\r\n\r\npast  years to build multi-storeyed flats, but I  think\r\n\r\nthis problem can partially be solved by a new approach.\r\n\r\nThis  morning, the Hon, the Minister said  that  he  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidering the removal of protection under the Control\r\n\r\nof  Rent Ordinance for prewar built flats, flats  built\r\n\r\nby  the  S.I.T., such as the 2,500 flats in  the  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  area.  I  know this is going to create  quite  a\r\n\r\nfurore and that I am stepping on a hornets' nest, but I\r\n\r\nthink there is justification for this point of view. As\r\n\r\nwe  know,  much  of the Tiong Bahru  area  is  now  not\r\n\r\npopulated by the people for whom the S.I.T. was created\r\n\r\nand  for whom these houses were intended. Through  good\r\n\r\nfortune  and  hard work, many of the people  who  lived\r\n\r\nthere  pre-war are now either businessmen or  in  well-established  positions. Again, during  the  Occupation,\r\n\r\nmany  of the original tenants sold out and these  flats\r\n\r\nare now occupied by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerchants  and, shall I say, fairly well-to-do  people.\r\n\r\nAnd  this anyone can see by taking a drive through  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrowded  streets at night when he can see  plush  cars,\r\n\r\nvery  valuable cars, jammed all along the footway. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  make  a suggestion - instead of trying  to  in-crease  the rent of these flats, would it not be better\r\n\r\nto  sell  these 2,500 flats to some of the tenants  who\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to buy them? For instance, if we  were  to\r\n\r\nvalue  a  flat at $12,000, and that is a modest  figure\r\n\r\ntoday  because  private estates are now offering  flats\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  the town for $24,000 each and it  will  only\r\n\r\ncost  less  than one-quarter of the proposed flats  for\r\n\r\nthe  doctors  at Kandang Kerbau - when you  compare  with\r\n\r\nthese   figures,  it  is  very  reasonable  to   charge\r\n\r\n$12,000 - $12,000  times 2,500 flats  means  $30,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere  you have your problem of financing this  housing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolved for the next year. If Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  payment by instalments over four to five years,\r\n\r\nI  am sure half of these flats would be sold in no time\r\n\r\nbecause  they are well worth the value. And  there  you\r\n\r\nhave  a means of proceeding with housing, you will find\r\n\r\nthe means to fight the housing shortage, by disposal of\r\n\r\nthese flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons the Hon. the Minister says why he\r\n\r\nhad  to take away these flats from the Control of  Rent\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is  because Government has to  pay  quite  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable   sum   for   their   administration   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance. Actually at the present day, no owner of a\r\n\r\npre-war  built  house ever maintains the  house  as  it\r\n\r\ncosts  him three times pre-war to repair it;  you  will\r\n\r\nnever  get  him  to  do it. Under the circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nthink  my  suggestion is a very reasonable  one.  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the housing authority, instead of being\r\n\r\na landlord alone, which it is today, should also assume\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of selling flats and undertaking the\r\n\r\nsubdivision  of  land for sale in rural  areas  to  the\r\n\r\npeople who live in the villages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few remarks which I hope will be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board   in\r\n\r\ncarrying out its arduous duties for the improvement  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, I heartily support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe explanatory statement of this Bill begins by\r\n\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The White Paper on the Report of the Committee\r\n\r\non  Local Government (No. Cmd. 30 of 1956) declared\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy that the Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust   should   cease  to  exist  and   that   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for   public   housing   and   the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive development and redevelopment, for  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of purposes, should be laid on a Singapore\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board appointed by the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I think we can remember that when the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Local Government, Lands and Housing tabled the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper, he met with the unanimous support  of\r\n\r\nthis  House.  It  is high time  not  only  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  recognise that  the  S.I.T. should\r\n\r\ncease to operate, but also to bear in mind to learn\r\n\r\na  bitter lesson from the S.I.T. As the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  just  mentioned, the S.I.T. flats  in\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  or  somewhere else only  benefit  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  class or upper class, who are not only  car\r\n\r\nowners  but also - and this is a well-known fact - find\r\n\r\nit  the best place to keep their second wives. Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is the S.I.T. policy and therefore it is high\r\n\r\ntime  for  the Government really to learn a  bitter\r\n\r\nlesson from it. They must admit that the S.I.T. has\r\n\r\nbeen negligent in the past of one responsibility as\r\n\r\nstated - Public housing and comprehensive development\r\n\r\nand redevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I expect this Bill will be supported\r\n\r\nunanimously   by  this  House,  I  wish   to   make\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to  the Government to  consider  about\r\n\r\nland clearance which, as we have learnt, has become\r\n\r\na  really  hard  thing to overcome. The  Government\r\n\r\nwant  to carry out the policy but find it very hard\r\n\r\nto remove the so-called squatters, who are actually\r\n\r\nattap-house dwellers. So why do the Government  not\r\n\r\nthink out a policy to select a big piece of land in\r\n\r\ntheir hands, say in Kranji, Lim Chu Kang, Chua  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  or Ayer Gumeroh, where there is still  plenty\r\n\r\nof  land  possessed by Government, places  which  I\r\n\r\nthink Government will take a long time to think  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping?  Why  not  make one  such  place  as  a\r\n\r\nsettlement for attap-house dwellers, where they can\r\n\r\nfind a place to build their own homes as they wish?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead  of this, they just issue notices  to  quit\r\n\r\nwith  what  we  believe  to be  adequate  sums  for\r\n\r\ncompensation.  And where do they go to?  Where  can\r\n\r\nthey  go  to  find  another  piece  of  land?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  already find it hard to let attap-house\r\n\r\ndwellers  settle  on  Government  land.  How  about\r\n\r\nprivate  landowners? They are  also  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nhardship  to  get  rid of them for  their  further\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I sincerely wish the Government will seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  this point. It is wise to have Government\r\n\r\nland reserved for farmers and workers who intend to\r\n\r\nbuild  their  own  attap  huts.  You  can  issue  a\r\n\r\nTemporary Occupation Licence or anything  else  you\r\n\r\nlike to let them have a roof of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Coalition Government is a so-called Socialistic Government; please prove it to\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  personally welcome the introduction of this Bill\r\n\r\nand my opinion is that it is high time that the new\r\n\r\nBoard  should  take  over  the  functions  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement  Trust  and  make   drastic\r\n\r\nchanges in the running of this new set-up. Look  at\r\n\r\nthe  record  of the S.I.T. for the last few  years.\r\n\r\nWhat  have  they done? What I know is that  in  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  1955,  the  number of people  on  their  list\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  Trust accommodation  was  well  below\r\n\r\n6,000.  Today,  the  list has increased  to  14,500\r\n\r\npeople waiting for Trust accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use to talk. What the people need is\r\n\r\nemployment and a house where they can live.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot a question of just sending in an application to\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. because back will come the reply  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  unable to comply with the request.  They\r\n\r\nhave  adopted  this as a common  practice.  On  all\r\n\r\nletters they will put, 'There is no possibility  in\r\n\r\nthe foreseeable future of offering assistance', and\r\n\r\nthe  applicant has to wait so many years, maybe the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years. That is the very common  sentence\r\n\r\nused by the S.I.T. today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said this morning, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list is due to the increase in population.\r\n\r\nDo you not think, Sir, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is his duty to look or to probe into the workings of\r\n\r\nthe   S.I.T. instead  of  sitting  inside   his   air-conditioned office?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another factor is that today you know very well\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. has spent the taxpayers' money, millions  of\r\n\r\nthem,   but  what  have  they  erected?  Multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nbuildings. Visitors from overseas who come to Singapore\r\n\r\nlook at our multi-storeyed buildings. Behind it is  the\r\n\r\nspending of so many millions. If you were to give me so\r\n\r\nmany  millions,  I could produce far better  buildings.\r\n\r\nAnd  besides  that, look at the Upper Pickering  Street\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmulti-storeyed flats they are so proud of. Besides them\r\n\r\nthey erected a row of garages to house the tuan besars,\r\n\r\nthe  \"big shots\", the bigwigs of the S.I.T. To  prevent\r\n\r\nwhat? - so that their cars will not go rusty, or the rain\r\n\r\nwill  not  fall,  or the sun will not shine,  on  their\r\n\r\ncars.  That is nonsense. I put my car outside,  in  the\r\n\r\nopen. And the garage itself is an eyesore. I invite the\r\n\r\nhon. Members of this House to go to the Upper Pickering\r\n\r\nStreet flats. Look at the garages. They are an eyesore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a disgrace to the S.I.T., and to the Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another instance, Sir; only last month they\r\n\r\nremoved  four pillars in the garages behind  the  nine-storeyed  flats along Upper Pickering Street,  just  to\r\n\r\nsuit  the  convenience of the officers working  in  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. because there is one-way traffic and they had to\r\n\r\ngo  through Hokkien Street along South Bridge Road  and\r\n\r\nUpper  Cross  Street back to their  homes  in  Tanglin,\r\n\r\nwhere they have big houses and palatial homes. Just  to\r\n\r\nsuit  their  convenience,  they  removed  the  pillars.\r\n\r\nSomeone  protested.  They  put  the  pillars  back  but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neventually  they removed them. Three times the  pillars\r\n\r\nwere  removed  and  replaced. That cost  the  taxpayers\r\n\r\nmoney.  I would remind the Minister to investigate  how\r\n\r\nmuch money they have spent on removing the pillars  and\r\n\r\npaving the ground behind the nine-storeyed building. It\r\n\r\nis a shame all right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the walls along the rows of nine-storeyed\r\n\r\nbuildings,  the  Nos.  3, 5, 7,  9,  11,  13  of  Upper\r\n\r\nPickering  Street.  The  other  day  I  saw  the  walls\r\n\r\ncrumbling  down and they were not made with cement  but\r\n\r\nsand;  and  the S.I.T., I was told, spent thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars to patch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup the walls. What happened to the walls? Why could not\r\n\r\nproper  supervision  be made of the  erection  of  this\r\n\r\nbuilding? Instead of cement for the walls, now we  have\r\n\r\nsand and they crumble down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If they were to owe rent for one week,\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks, they will receive quit notices, and on  top\r\n\r\nof that they will be made to pay the bill within the 14-day  period  and also pay a sum of over $10  for  stamp\r\n\r\nduty;  a  shop has to pay over $30. As you  say,  these\r\n\r\npeople who live in S.I.T. houses are all moderately off\r\n\r\nor  they are poor families. To make them pay $10 or $30\r\n\r\nis  really  a hardship to these people. Some  of  these\r\n\r\nfamilies are really living from hand to mouth and I  do\r\n\r\nnot agree -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Point of\r\n\r\nexplanation, Sir. We were just informed a moment ago by\r\n\r\nthe  Liberal-Socialist Member for Paya Lebar  that  the\r\n\r\npeople who reside in S.I.T. houses, particularly in the\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  area,  have  big  cars  and  are  wealthy\r\n\r\npersons. Now we are told by the Member for Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\nthat  they are living from hand to month.

The  thing  is  that the  S.I.T. make  periodic\r\n\r\ninvestigations, that is, regular inspections, into  all\r\n\r\nhouseholds. These have been spied on. It is worse  than\r\n\r\nthe  Kempetai; it is worse than the Gestapo, worse than\r\n\r\nthe  secret police. Why should they go and spy  on  the\r\n\r\nhouses?  Six  o'clock  in the morning,  seven  o'clock,\r\n\r\neight  o'clock and nine o'clock; they even  go  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of going to the house at eleven o'clock in  the\r\n\r\nnight  to check whether the families are staying  there\r\n\r\nor  not! They have a system of checking but to knock at\r\n\r\nthe  tenants'  flats, to knock at the doors  at  eleven\r\n\r\no'clock  in the night - I am asking hon. Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  is  that not a shame? They are not thieves.  If\r\n\r\nthey  have any evidence that these people are  not  the\r\n\r\ntenants,  they can issue them a notice or ask  them  to\r\n\r\nclear  off. But instead, they are spying on them  every\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am coming back to the S.I.T. You know, I think\r\n\r\nall  the hon. Members of this House are aware that  the\r\n\r\nUpper  Pickering Street flats have got the nickname  of\r\n\r\n\"suicide  flats\".  When  these flats  were  built,  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. or  whoever run the office, refused to  put  up\r\n\r\nwire-netting,  so  much so that  over  a  dozen  people\r\n\r\njumped  to their death. All these dead have dependants.\r\n\r\nThey  have  their  suffering. And after  over  a  dozen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeaths, the S.I.T. decided to put up wire-netting.  But\r\n\r\nbefore  that,  look at the centre block  of  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats  for  the  officers.  Displayed  on  top  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings  is all wire-netting. Why? Because  the  tuan\r\n\r\nbesars are staying there, they have wire-netting.  That\r\n\r\nmeans  they consider Asian lives very cheap.  The  tuan\r\n\r\nbesars  living  in the flats on top of these  offices\r\n\r\nare  more  worthy. Is it because their lives  are  more\r\n\r\nvaluable than our lives? So much so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat after so many deaths did the S.I.T. at last decide\r\n\r\nto put wire-netting, and there is no more suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important Bill, and about the\r\n\r\nfive  members to be appointed on the Board I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to appoint persons with experience,  not\r\n\r\nthose who have a sort of tendency to say 'yes' to every\r\n\r\nmove   the   Government  takes.   Besides   that,   the\r\n\r\nappointment  is  for three years. We want  people  with\r\n\r\nexperience  to run or to control the functions  of  the\r\n\r\nnew Board, not to fill it up with 'yes-men'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am also glad the number of members of the new\r\n\r\nBoard  will  be  reduced  to five,  because  that  will\r\n\r\nsimplify matters to carry out the job more smoothly; as\r\n\r\nwe  know,  we have a saying, 'Too many cooks spoil  the\r\n\r\nsoup.' On the Trust, we have so many people running the\r\n\r\nDepartment, so much so that they do not know  where  to\r\n\r\ngo  and  what to do, and with no experience  whatsoever\r\n\r\nthe whole Department actually was run by the expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Sir, I will relate an incident\r\n\r\nthat  happened  in one of the S.I.T. offices  on  23rd\r\n\r\nAugust.

But why are there so many\r\n\r\nattap houses and why are there so many people\r\n\r\nliving in little cubicles? There is only one\r\n\r\nreason, and that reason is they have not got the\r\n\r\nland on which to build their own houses. I am\r\n\r\ncertain, Sir, that if we find a dilapidated attap\r\n\r\nhouse, it is not because the man cannot afford to\r\n\r\nrepair it, or likes it to be in that shape. In his\r\n\r\nmind, he always thinks, 'No matter how I repair it,\r\n\r\nor how beautiful I make it, sooner or later a quit\r\n\r\nnotice will come; sooner or later I will be asked\r\n\r\nby the Government to give up my house and land.'\r\n\r\nWhere is the incentive for that man to add\r\n\r\nimprovements to his house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the experience, Sir, of knowing a little\r\n\r\nplot  of land built up with many huts by squatters.\r\n\r\nThese squatters came together; they put their money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntogether;  and  they  bought that  piece  of  land.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards, they improved their houses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  I would say, Sir, that those attap houses were\r\n\r\nnot  at  all  bad dwelling places after  they  were\r\n\r\nrepaired properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attap houses built properly, with proper\r\n\r\nsanitation  put in are definitely much better  than\r\n\r\nthe flats we have in town. At least they are cooler\r\n\r\nand they can be very attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, has\r\n\r\nput   this   idea  to  Government  and  asked   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to buy land, show a lead and give  these\r\n\r\nattap  house  dwellers a chance to  buy  their  own\r\n\r\nland.  If  that  scheme  is pushed  forward,  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain that it will solve our housing problem to a\r\n\r\nvery  great  extent.  I  am also  certain  that  if\r\n\r\nGovernment  can give those who live in  slum  areas\r\n\r\nnow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplots  of  land on which to build their own  little\r\n\r\nhouses, they will certainly put in all they have to\r\n\r\nmake  the  place  they live in, decent,  clean  and\r\n\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in Singapore, I feel that it is time that\r\n\r\neverybody  should  have a stake in  the  land  they\r\n\r\nlive.

It\r\n\r\nis  no use denigrating the S.I.T. and its officials\r\n\r\nif  the Housing and Development Board and the  five\r\n\r\npersons who are going to constitute it are going to\r\n\r\nbe  lifted  out from the S.I.T. and  put  into  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board. Members will  still\r\n\r\nbe  constantly  bedeviled by the Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  regaling us with his unfortunate  encounters\r\n\r\nwith  Trust  officers and Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  officers,  and the disrespectful  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich they deal with Assemblymen generally and with\r\n\r\nMinisters in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain problems stand out, and the only thing\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill does is to sharpen the  instrument\r\n\r\nwhich  has to be used in dealing with the problems.\r\n\r\nThe  problem is how, with the resources  available,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   the   national  income  of   the   State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore - the State to come - we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  build  enough houses on the land available,  to\r\n\r\nhouse  as  many as possible of the rapidly  growing\r\n\r\npopulation. That problem will not be solved by this\r\n\r\ntheory  of selling flats to those who live in  them\r\n\r\nand taking the money and building other flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is primarily a problem of raising the national\r\n\r\nincome of the Colony, or the State of Singapore  as\r\n\r\nit  will be; of seeing that the national income  is\r\n\r\nused  in  the interests of all the people  and  not\r\n\r\njust of a wealthy few, and, what is most important,\r\n\r\nof getting an efficient housing authority that will\r\n\r\nbe  able, with the limited resources that  will  be\r\n\r\navailable to it, to produce maximum results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.I.T. is to be buried when this Bill comes\r\n\r\ninto   operation.  I  think  it  will   always   be\r\n\r\nremembered for as long as the skyscrapers stand  in\r\n\r\nForfar House and the other multi-storeyed flats  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I do not believe they are all  going  to\r\n\r\ncrumble down as rapidly as was feared by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tiong  Bahru.  But the  S.I.T. will  also  be\r\n\r\nremembered for a policy which was not suited to the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  this  island. I  had  the  advantage  of\r\n\r\nstarting  my professional career here,  sitting  in\r\n\r\nthe shadow of the legal adviser to the S.I.T. and I\r\n\r\nused to meet these eminent gentlemen, very powerful\r\n\r\npeople, who from time to time foregathered  in  the\r\n\r\nconference   room  of  their  legal   adviser   and\r\n\r\ndiscussed  the  problems of the  City.  They  never\r\n\r\nbelieved  they were going to solve them, but  their\r\n\r\npredominant  intention was to make sure  that  what\r\n\r\nthey  built  did  not subsequently degenerate  into\r\n\r\nslums. Well that is a worthy objective, but because\r\n\r\nthey did not understand the pressure that would  be\r\n\r\nput  on  the Government when housing is short,  and\r\n\r\nwhen   a  Government  is  susceptible  to  pressure\r\n\r\nbecause  it is elected, they have left  in  fact  a\r\n\r\nlegacy  of  no-confidence in the housing  authority\r\n\r\nwhich  they represented. This Bill does  not  solve\r\n\r\nany  of these problems and the advice given by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Paya  Lebar  to  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board which is to be created  will  not\r\n\r\nsolve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we have to ask ourselves whether or not\r\n\r\nthis  island can, with a population growing at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  4  per  cent  per annum,  and  an  annual\r\n\r\nincrease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the available working population of about 27,000\r\n\r\nof the children who are growing up to reach 17, 18,\r\n\r\n19  and  enter the labour market, be able  to  keep\r\n\r\npace with our economic development to maintain them\r\n\r\nat  that  standard of living which  can  provide  a\r\n\r\ndecent semi permanent or permanent structure  of  a\r\n\r\nhouse  to  live in. And if that is not possible  of\r\n\r\nsolution,  then all the clever schemes and  devices\r\n\r\nsuggested will not solve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems have got to be faced at its root\r\n\r\nbottom.  The  population  problem  has  got  to  be\r\n\r\ntackled. Either we check it or we emigrate  to  the\r\n\r\nwilds of the Federation to help open up the forests\r\n\r\nthere, either legally or illegally. Secondly,  such\r\n\r\nas  do  remain here must be accommodated  into  the\r\n\r\neconomy  by  jobs. And then, lastly,  we  can  talk\r\n\r\nabout dividing the land and letting everybody own a\r\n\r\nlittle  piece in order that he will find  it  worth\r\n\r\nwhile  to build on it. Today I would like  just  to\r\n\r\nremind the Member for Serangoon that people do  not\r\n\r\nbuild houses, not because they do not own the land,\r\n\r\nbut  because  they have not got the wherewithal  to\r\n\r\nbuy  the building materials and the skilled  labour\r\n\r\nnecessary  to put up the houses. If they had,  they\r\n\r\nwould  build  them  whether it was  their  land  or\r\n\r\nrented land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem goes down back finally to the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  this  island in a  changed  political\r\n\r\nsituation, not only Malaya vis-a-vis Singapore, but\r\n\r\nin the whole of South-East Asia, and this Bill only\r\n\r\nprovides  us  with the instrument.  It  is  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient instrument but I must not let  it  go  by\r\n\r\njust  like  that. It has taken two  years  to  come\r\n\r\nabout.  Why it has taken two years I do  not  know,\r\n\r\nand I would be sorry to hear that the Minister also\r\n\r\ndoes not know what is going on. I hope that in  his\r\n\r\nreply he will tell us why it has taken two years in\r\n\r\nthe  making,  and perhaps assure us that  the  time\r\n\r\nspent in contemplating over the provisions of  this\r\n\r\nBill is time that was spent wisely and effectively,\r\n\r\nin order that we will have a housing authority with\r\n\r\nall  the  adequate powers to deal with the problems\r\n\r\nof  (1)  slum clearance; (2) squatter resettlement;\r\n\r\nand (3) problems of finance and building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI was told this morning that this Bill would be\r\n\r\nreferred to a Select Committee and I had thought\r\n\r\nthat it would be best to speak on the Bill after\r\n\r\nreceiving the report of the Select Committee rather\r\n\r\nthan to refer to the Bill now. But after hearing\r\n\r\nthe points put forward by the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru, I am most particularly interested in clause\r\n\r\n33 of the Bill, which clause reads in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) Upon the coming into operation of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   every   officer   of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust, not being an officer exclusively\r\n\r\nengaged  in the planning functions of the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement   Trust,  shall   be   deemed   to   be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the service of the Board at the same\r\n\r\nrate  of  pay and, as near as may be, on  the  same\r\n\r\nconditions  of service, as those on  which  he  was\r\n\r\nemployed by the Singapore Improvement Trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  have  heard from the Member for Tiong Bahru  of\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  and the manner of the officers,  how\r\n\r\nthey run the S.I.T., and if all those officers  now\r\n\r\non  the Trust shall be deemed to be transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board, I wonder what difference it would  make\r\n\r\nto  the Board. If the administration of the present\r\n\r\nTrust  is  run by a set of officers whose  attitude\r\n\r\nand  administration of the Trust is not  acceptable\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly,  I cannot understand  that  the\r\n\r\ntransfer of the same officers to this Board can  be\r\n\r\naccepted by this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present administration of the Trust, as\r\n\r\neveryone  knows, is top-secret. The points  system,\r\n\r\neveryone  knows, is top-secret. As the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong Bahru rightly pointed out, the number on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list has increased to 14,000 but how  many\r\n\r\nof  these  14,000 do know when they can  expect  to\r\n\r\nhave  allocation? The reply always  given  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no possible assistance in the very  near\r\n\r\nfuture. What difference would it make, I would like\r\n\r\nto know; and I would like also the Minister to tell\r\n\r\nus  the  actual difference it could  make  to  this\r\n\r\nBoard  if the complete setup of the S.I.T. officers\r\n\r\nis to be transferred. I would suggest that when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard  comes  into  operation, all officers  should  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  review  and should be  placed  before  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service Commission before they are accepted  as\r\n\r\nofficers of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to note\r\n\r\nthat  Members of the Opposition generally  support  the\r\n\r\nBill just now before the House, but unfortunately I  am\r\n\r\nsomewhat in disagreement with them with regard to their\r\n\r\ncriticisms  of  its officers and the  workings  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust, not because I agree  with\r\n\r\nwhat is happening now in the offices of the S.I.T. but\r\n\r\nbecause  I,  as  Minister for Housing  at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment,  have  in fact no proper or no  direct  control\r\n\r\nover  the  workings or over the Trustees of the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nand naturally I do not have the direct control over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhabits, or shall we say the inconsistencies if at  all,\r\n\r\nthat are now prevalent in the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I should like to answer some of the\r\n\r\npoints  raised by Members of the Opposition.  First,  I\r\n\r\nwould  take the Member for Paya Lebar. He has suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government should buy up land  in  satellite\r\n\r\ntowns,  cut  it  up  and probably sell  it  to  private\r\n\r\ninvestors, who would develop the land, build houses and\r\n\r\nsell them to the public. Well, Sir, I disagree entirely\r\n\r\nwith this because I honestly and sincerely feel that it\r\n\r\nis  the  duty of Government in the long run to  provide\r\n\r\nthe  necessary housing, particularly in what are called\r\n\r\nnew  towns  or satellite towns, as this is  within  the\r\n\r\nscheme  which  the present Government has envisaged  in\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, there is now no restriction at all\r\n\r\nbeing  placed  by Government on private development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As  a  matter of fact,  it  has  encouraged\r\n\r\nprivate developers to build as many houses as possible,\r\n\r\nbut  unfortunately it has been the tendency in the past\r\n\r\nfor private developers to build houses costing probably\r\n\r\n$15,000  or $20,000 or even more, which cater  not  for\r\n\r\nthe type of people which Government would like to help,\r\n\r\nbut purely for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose who can afford either from their own pockets,  or\r\n\r\nwho  can  afford to borrow from building societies,  to\r\n\r\nmeet their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the question of selling flats in Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru; well, that is a wonderful idea. I think we  will\r\n\r\nprobably try to do something about it but, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar suggests that  the\r\n\r\nsale of these houses would probably rake in a total  of\r\n\r\n$13,000,000 and this would help to finance the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board for the next few years. Well,  I\r\n\r\nthink he is a bit out because this year alone, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  spending  more  than $23,000,000  on  our  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme.  So $13,000,000 at this rate of  expenditure\r\n\r\nwould  probably  mean a six months' building  programme\r\n\r\nfor the Board. However, I shall look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Changi, he seems to think,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  Government has plenty of land in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWell,  this is all nonsense because if he were to  read\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Estimates,  he  will  discover  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore is spending millions of dollars\r\n\r\nin  the  purchase  of  land  not  only  for  Government\r\n\r\nschemes,  but also for S.I.T. buildings,  and  for  the\r\n\r\nresettlement  of  farmers all  over  the  island.  This\r\n\r\nlatter  scheme is going on in full swing and we believe\r\n\r\nmillions more would be spent on this programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I\r\n\r\nwish  the  Minister  to know that I named  places  like\r\n\r\nKranji  or  Ayer  Gemuroh.

I think certain people  staying  in\r\n\r\nKranji have received notices from S.I.T. to quit  after\r\n\r\nthey  had  put  up a certain amount of money  to  build\r\n\r\nattap  houses and had stayed there for over two  years.\r\n\r\nNow  the  S.I.T. say, 'No, you must quit.'

In  its\r\n\r\nstatement of policy in paragraph 3 (2), pages 2  and  3\r\n\r\nof  the  Paper, Government indicated that  it  did  not\r\n\r\naccept  wholly  the McNeice Committee's recommendations\r\n\r\nthat  the administration of the planned use of  land,\r\n\r\ninvolving control of development and the preparation of\r\n\r\ndetailed  plans  should  be the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities. It further stated as follows  if  I\r\n\r\nmay read, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government considers that for the time being a\r\n\r\nTown  Planning Department should be set  up  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Local Government, Lands  and  Housing  to\r\n\r\nadvise  all  local  authorities  and  do  the  detailed\r\n\r\nplanning.  Local authorities should have full authority\r\n\r\nto  make  decisions on plans submitted which  would  be\r\n\r\ntaken  after  receiving the advice (but not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe   in  conformity  with  it)  of  the  Town  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment.  An  appeal  can  be  made  direct  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   from  individuals  dissatisfied   with   the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  the  local  authorities.  It   is   also\r\n\r\nconsidered   that   in  due  course   of   time,   when\r\n\r\npracticable, the Town Planning Department  should  hand\r\n\r\nover  its  records to the local authorities, who  would\r\n\r\nthen  be  directly responsible for local planning,  due\r\n\r\nregard being paid to the provisions of the Master Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also agreed that the Minister should have\r\n\r\npowers of arbitration and direction in planning matters\r\n\r\nand  that the administration of the Master Plan  should\r\n\r\nbe  administered  by Government. It is also  considered\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister should be granted powers to  permit\r\n\r\nhim  to take independent advice in planning matters  at\r\n\r\nthe  five-yearly reviews of the Master Plan and at such\r\n\r\nother  times as he considers necessary but without  any\r\n\r\nobligation on his part to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before this House merely attempts\r\n\r\nto give flesh to the skeletal structure proposed in the\r\n\r\nWhite   Paper   on  Local  Government.   The   Planning\r\n\r\norganisation  may,  however,  still  not   be   readily\r\n\r\napparent  from  the  provisions of the  Planning  Bill.\r\n\r\nClause 3 of the Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovides  merely  that such person or  persons  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  in-Council thinks fit may  be  appointed  the\r\n\r\nCompetent  Authority or the Competent  Authorities  for\r\n\r\nthe  operation of the Ordinance either generally or  in\r\n\r\nrelation to any particular section of the Ordinance.  I\r\n\r\nshould therefore explain that the administration of the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Bill will lie with several bodies -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first\r\n\r\nof these bodies will be a\r\n\r\nGovernment  Planning Department under the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLocal   Government,  Lands  and  Housing  which'   will\r\n\r\ncomprise  three  divisions  made  up  of  the   present\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Master Plan Division which will be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the preparation and  revision  of\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan under its Planning Adviser;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Replanning Division which will be responsible\r\n\r\nfor  interpretation and detailed planning  of  the\r\n\r\nMaster   Plan,   and   give   advice   to    local\r\n\r\nauthorities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Development Control Division which will be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  controlling  development   under\r\n\r\nplans  submitted  by  private  persons  and   will\r\n\r\nadvise local authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second of the bodies responsible for the\r\n\r\nadministration  of the Bill are the local  authorities,\r\n\r\nwho will be made Competent Authorities for the purposes\r\n\r\nof  sections 8, 9 to 14 of the Planning Bill  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective local authority areas, except for new  towns\r\n\r\nor  areas of comprehensive redevelopment which will  be\r\n\r\nadministered by the Housing and Development Board.  The\r\n\r\nlocal  authority when appointed will have its authority\r\n\r\nlimited  to  the  following extent and manner.  In  the\r\n\r\npreliminary  phase,  the local authority  will  act  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the advice of the Planning  Department\r\n\r\n(Replanning  or  Development  Control  Division).  This\r\n\r\nlimitation  is  made to enable the local  authority  to\r\n\r\ngain  experience and become familiar with the procedure\r\n\r\nand  principles  of the control of development.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected,  Sir, that in the case of the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nthe  preliminary phase will only last a few months.  In\r\n\r\nthe  second  phase,  the local authority  will  act  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with, but not necessarily in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  advice  of,  the   Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment.   In  the  third  phase,   the   local\r\n\r\nauthority  will be solely responsible for  control\r\n\r\nof  development. This third phase will be  reached\r\n\r\nwhen  the records and such staff as may be agreed,\r\n\r\ncan  be  separated and transferred to  each  local\r\n\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated, Sir, that the Housing\r\n\r\nand   Development  Board  will  be  the  Competent\r\n\r\nAuthority for the purposes of sections 9 to 14 in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  new towns and areas of  comprehensive\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there will be my own Ministry, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Local Government, Lands and  Housing,\r\n\r\nassisted by a separate inspectorate, if necessary,\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  appeals  to the  Minister  against\r\n\r\nplanning decisions and to give independent  advice\r\n\r\nif required to the Minister on planning matters at\r\n\r\nthe  five-yearly reviews of the Master Plan or  at\r\n\r\nsuch  other times as the Minister may consider  it\r\n\r\nnecessary. It has, I know, been a source  of  some\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  that  the Trust  has,  under  the\r\n\r\npresent  legislation, rather extensive powers  and\r\n\r\nthat  their  decisions are not subject to  appeal.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been necessary in the past  before  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublication  of the Master Plan,  but  it  is  now\r\n\r\npossible  to provide dissatisfied owners with  the\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal against what they  may  consider\r\n\r\nunreasonable decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch upon one matter which has, no\r\n\r\ndoubt, exercised the minds of many owners, namely,\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  compensation  for  lands  which\r\n\r\nsuffer  depreciation in value as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  or  provisions of the  Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  question  of considerable  difficulty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  has not been solved satisfactorily  in  any\r\n\r\nother  legislation. In the original United Kingdom\r\n\r\nplanning   legislation,  liability  for   payments\r\n\r\nbecause  of  depreciation in values were  accepted\r\n\r\nbut   they  were  only  accepted  because  it  was\r\n\r\nintended  to  recoup such payments by charges  for\r\n\r\nbetterment  of  lands  for  which  permission   to\r\n\r\ndevelop  was given under the planning legislation.\r\n\r\nIt  has  now  been  found impracticable,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecover  betterment charges which  have  therefore\r\n\r\nhad    to   be   dropped.   After   very   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided that as there was  equally\r\n\r\nno  practicable  way  of  collecting  charges  for\r\n\r\nbetterment  in  Singapore, it  cannot  accept  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of compensation. To owners who  may  be\r\n\r\ndisappointed by such a decision, I would point out\r\n\r\nthat none of the provisions of the Master Plan can\r\n\r\nreally be said to be of a permanent nature,  since\r\n\r\nit would be subject to revision at the five-yearly\r\n\r\nreviews  and it would also be open to  any  future\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  alter  or even  scrap  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan - not  that  I  think this latter  decision  is\r\n\r\nlikely, as the Master Plan has been the result  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable  survey and study. I would  say  also\r\n\r\nthat   the   principle  must  be   accepted   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not normally bound  to  compensate\r\n\r\nparties who suffer incidental loss as a result  of\r\n\r\nState  action  designed for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  as a whole. A provision has,  however,\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in clause 15, to require,  in  certain\r\n\r\nlimited  cases,  the Government to purchase  land.\r\n\r\nThis  is  intended  to  provide  that  where,  for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample, a developer has been required to  provide\r\n\r\nan  open  space or school in a development  estate\r\n\r\nand  has otherwise completed his development,  the\r\n\r\nremaining public purpose areas should be acquired,\r\n\r\nwhere  the land is required within five years  and\r\n\r\nis not capable of reasonably beneficial use in its\r\n\r\nexisting state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say any more about the\r\n\r\nBill as the provisions will be clear from the full\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement which  has  been  furnished\r\n\r\nwith  the Bill. I should add, however, that I have\r\n\r\ngiven notice of certain amendments which are to be\r\n\r\nmade  in Select Committee to which this Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, as this Bill\r\n\r\nis  going to Select Committee, I do not propose to\r\n\r\nsay anything in detail. There are only two salient\r\n\r\nfeatures which I would like to point out  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  particularly  to  Members  who  may  be\r\n\r\nchosen to sit on the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big feature in respect of the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  was  the complaint - bitter  in  many\r\n\r\ncases - of  delays in the passing of plans some of  which\r\n\r\ntook  as  long  as  two years. The  Hon, the  Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned that possibly the delay was partly due to the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan. I hope that is true but in order to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of this town and to help  people  who\r\n\r\nwish to develop Singapore and not be frustrated by long\r\n\r\ndelays of one or two years, it is imperative that plans\r\n\r\nshould  be  passed - especially  subdivision  plans  - for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  within three months. One  very  disturbing\r\n\r\nfeature  is clause 14 (1) of this Bill which says  that\r\n\r\nif permission to develop any land or subdivision of any\r\n\r\nland is refused, and if he is aggrieved by the decision\r\n\r\nof  the Competent Authority may appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\nSir, no decision is given as to whether the appeal will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo   to   Government  officials  only  or  to  a  Board\r\n\r\nconsisting of architects and persons who are versed  in\r\n\r\nthe  planning  of  the  town.  This  is  a  very  vital\r\n\r\nassurance which I hope the Minister will give us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also very considerable change in the period\r\n\r\nunder  which a plan has to be passed. Clause 9 (11)  on\r\n\r\npage 8 of the Bill says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If within three months from the date of receipt by\r\n\r\nthe   Competent   Authority  of  an   application   for\r\n\r\npermission  to  develop  or  subdivide  any  land   the\r\n\r\nCompetent  Authority  has neither granted  nor  refused\r\n\r\nsuch permission the application shall be deemed to have\r\n\r\nbeen  refused  and  the applicant  may  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in accordance with the provisions or  section\r\n\r\n14 of this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I am afraid that a new provision like this  is  a\r\n\r\ntotal  departure  from  the  previous  section  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Ordinance and instead of  helping\r\n\r\nplans  to be passed rapidly, this may tend to get  some\r\n\r\nof these plans forgotten altogether. Under the previous\r\n\r\nsection,  if a plan has not been approved within  three\r\n\r\nmonths and if the Competent Authority has not seen  fit\r\n\r\nto  make demands on the person submitting the plan  for\r\n\r\nfurther  detail,  the  plan  is  deemed  to  have  been\r\n\r\napproved.  I  think  that is a much  more  satisfactory\r\n\r\nprovision whereby if a plan is not re-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njected,   due  to  the  carelessness  of  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment,  then  it  should be deemed  to  have  been\r\n\r\napproved  instead of it being deemed to be  disapproved\r\n\r\naltogether. It would also mean throwing the  burden  on\r\n\r\nthe  person  submitting  the  plan  to  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  and  no time is given in  this  Bill  as  to\r\n\r\nwithin  what period an appeal may be heard. It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  by  the time the plan is discovered or remembered\r\n\r\nagain  six  months have passed and then the appeal  may\r\n\r\ntake  another six months. In this way, two years  would\r\n\r\nhave  then  elapsed before anything was  done.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that this new provision is not going to help  us\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to bring before this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is the question of survey fees as  stated  in\r\n\r\nclause 9 (3) (b) on page 6 of the Bill which says  that\r\n\r\nif  an  application  is  made  by  a  planner  \"to  the\r\n\r\nCollector and has deposited a sum sufficient  to  cover\r\n\r\nthe  fees for the survey of all lots comprised  in  the\r\n\r\npermitted  subdivision\", then the plans for subdivision\r\n\r\nshall  be considered. Sir, I have been on this question\r\n\r\nof  the  survey  fees  for quite  a  long  time.  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned particularly where efforts are being made  to\r\n\r\nsell  land  to small holders and people who are  to  be\r\n\r\nresettled.  I  have one particular case  in  mind.  One\r\n\r\ncompany  wanted to resettle squatters and offered  each\r\n\r\nof  them an area near the place where they were  to  be\r\n\r\nshifted  from - an area of about 10,000 square  feet  for\r\n\r\njust about $500 or $600. The squatters thought it was a\r\n\r\nvery  generous gesture and were only too glad to accept\r\n\r\nit  but  when the plan went to subdivision he was  told\r\n\r\nthat the fee for subdivision would be $112 which to  my\r\n\r\nmind, Sir, is out of all proportion to what is intended\r\n\r\nto  benefit  the poor man. After all, if  the  surveyor\r\n\r\ndoes  the  actual work, we cannot complain but  in  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of cases - virtually in every case - the surveyor\r\n\r\ndoes  not do the original survey. The survey has to  be\r\n\r\ndone  by a private surveyor who has got to go out  into\r\n\r\nthe field and peg Out the proper boundaries and then in\r\n\r\nthe fullness of time - it may be six months or it may  be\r\n\r\na year and I heard sometimes it may take three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  because  of  the backlog of work -  the  surveyor\r\n\r\ncomes round to check the survey and he wants $112 which\r\n\r\nis  about  twice as much as the amount charged  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate  surveyor who did the actual job. We have  been\r\n\r\nappealing to Government on this point and we  have  had\r\n\r\nno  result  for  the  past three  years;  we  have  got\r\n\r\nnowhere.  I would ask Government to seriously  consider\r\n\r\nthis position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\none   who   has   been  familiar  with  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Ordinance for the last 20 years, I think  I\r\n\r\ndo  know  a lot of, shall we say, the mistakes of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The unfortunate part of it is that all these\r\n\r\nmistakes are being repeated in this new Bill. In  fact,\r\n\r\nin  many cases, it is worse than before. Overall powers\r\n\r\nare asked by the Government in this Bill in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  development of all land and such  powers  are  not\r\n\r\neven found in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance or in\r\n\r\nthe  English Town Planning Act. I studied both of these\r\n\r\ncarefully  before  I  came  to  this  house.  Take  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  this  Bill wants to control even  the  wall,\r\n\r\nfence,  platform, staging, gate, post, pillar,  paling,\r\n\r\nframe,  hoarding, and so on. Does the Government intend\r\n\r\nthat  the public should ask permission for these  minor\r\n\r\nworks? All this control has already been vested in  the\r\n\r\nlocal authorities either in the District Councils or in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council. I think it is really a waste of time\r\n\r\non the part of the public to ask for such approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly being reminded in this House by the\r\n\r\nHon, the  Financial  Secretary  that  funds  are  very \r\n\r\nlimited  and  that it is possible that we may  have  to\r\n\r\nreduce expenditure in the years to come. Housing  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  big  problem and, as the Minister  has  said,  no\r\n\r\ncountry   can  provide  enough  houses.  In  order   to\r\n\r\nencourage housing and other building activities  so  as\r\n\r\nto  provide more employment to the local people,  every\r\n\r\nencouragement  should  be given to  the  developers  of\r\n\r\nfactories,  offices, houses, and so on. When  we  asked\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. before why it took such a long time to pass\r\n\r\na  plan, the reply was, \"Oh, we have to go through  all\r\n\r\nsorts of enqui-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nries. We are short of officers, and what not.\" We  have\r\n\r\nspent  millions  of  dollars on the  Master  Plan.  The\r\n\r\nMaster   Plan   has  already  been  approved   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Master Plan, we can safely say, is  the\r\n\r\nbible of the Planning authorities. Every piece of  land\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is  marked on it. Land  for  residential\r\n\r\npurposes,  density  per acre roads, road  widening  and\r\n\r\ntraffic circles are all marked there. The structure  of\r\n\r\nthis  new  Bill is different in that there is a  clause\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that if permission is neither granted  nor\r\n\r\nrefused  within  three months, as the Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar said, the application is automatically deemed  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  disapproved. In the  former  Bill,  it  was\r\n\r\nautomatically  deemed to have been approved.  We  have,\r\n\r\nSir,  considered this Bill carefully and yet  we  think\r\n\r\nfor  the purposes of the Master Plan that there is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  no necessity for this provision of three months.\r\n\r\nI  think  one  month  is more than  sufficient  because\r\n\r\nanyone   who  can  read  the  Master  Plan   will   see\r\n\r\nstraightaway that land reserved for a residential area,\r\n\r\nfor  a main shopping area or for a local shopping area,\r\n\r\nis  all  marked there. So where is the difficulty?  Why\r\n\r\ndoes the Government want such a long time? As I say, if\r\n\r\nyou  want  people to develop land here, you  must  give\r\n\r\nthem  every  encouragement to do so instead of  saying,\r\n\r\n\"You must ask permission first for everything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. We have heard a lot of\r\n\r\ncomplaints and dissatisfaction about the working of the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.  One main reason is that they never give us  the\r\n\r\nreasons for disapproving a plan. Discussions have  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on between the architects and the Government  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and we have been told more or  less  that\r\n\r\nprovision for this will be made in the new Bill. I  see\r\n\r\nno  such  provision at all in this new Bill.  The  only\r\n\r\nsafeguard  is that if you have a plan disapproved,  you\r\n\r\ncan  always appeal to the Minister. When you appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, then the SIT, must furnish  the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the disapproval. Does the Government think  it  is\r\n\r\nright not to furnish the reasons for the disapproval of\r\n\r\na  plan?  The Government must satisfy those people  who\r\n\r\ncome and invest money here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  see  that  they are given a  fair  deal.  They\r\n\r\nshould   not   just   say,  \"Oh,   your   plan   is\r\n\r\ndisapproved.\" That kind of dictatorial attitude,  I\r\n\r\nthink, should not be adopted at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the Competent Authority, clause\r\n\r\n3 of the Bill reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Governor in Council may by notification in\r\n\r\nthe  Gazette appoint such person or persons  as  he\r\n\r\nthinks  fit  to  be  the  Competent  Authority   or\r\n\r\nAuthorities responsible for the operation  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Government may appoint a person or persons  to\r\n\r\nbe   the   Competent  Authority   or   Authorities.\r\n\r\nAccusations are made by the public as  well  as  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  House about certain persons employed  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust and  working  in  this\r\n\r\nvery   Department.  Although  no  proof  has   been\r\n\r\nestablished, I am sure that Government is aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  true  position  and  is undertaking  extensive\r\n\r\nenquiries  into  allegations  of  corruption  by\r\n\r\ncertain  officers.  I  understand  that  all  these\r\n\r\nofficers of the Planning Section have been taken on\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, we must rely on the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nappoint  the proper men and not to appoint  persons\r\n\r\nwho are suspected of corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore Improvement Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nGovernment have no power to cancel approval whereas\r\n\r\nin  this new Bill, the Government has. I do not say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  against such cancellation as  I  think\r\n\r\nGovernment  should in certain cases have  power  to\r\n\r\ncancel  the approval if the circumstances  of  such\r\n\r\napproval have changed since it was granted, but the\r\n\r\ntime factor of two years is rather short. It states\r\n\r\nhere  that  if notice of commencement  of  building\r\n\r\noperations has not been given or if a building  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  completed within two years, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas the power to cancel such approval. We know very\r\n\r\nwell. Sir, on this question of development of  land\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not like buying anything or  something\r\n\r\nlike that. It takes a lot of time. Suppose you  get\r\n\r\na plan approved; then possibly you have to resettle\r\n\r\nthe  squatters, and you know how difficult that is.\r\n\r\nApart  from  this  difficulty  experienced  by  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate owners, even the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust with all the  resources  at  its\r\n\r\ndisposal   to   give   these   people   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation are unable to clear them.  Take,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, Queenstown; there are still many of these\r\n\r\nsquatters  there.  I  think  that  to  cancel   the\r\n\r\napproval in such a way is a bit too harsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, according to the Bill, if work has started\r\n\r\non  a  building and it is not completed within two\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Minister has the power to  cancel  the\r\n\r\napproval  given. Two years is a very  short  period\r\n\r\nfor  big developments. Of course, it may be  argued\r\n\r\nthat the Minister will definitely consider all  the\r\n\r\nrelevant conditions before making a decision but we\r\n\r\nknow  very  well that the Minister is a  very  busy\r\n\r\nmail  and he has to take the advice of the Planning\r\n\r\nauthorities so that I think more safeguards  should\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  these developers. After  all,  these\r\n\r\npeople  are really the developers of land and  they\r\n\r\nbring prosperity to Singapore. They are not a  gang\r\n\r\nof hooligans whom we want to suppress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have explained earlier about the\r\n\r\nerection  of  gates, posts, etc., we have  to  seek\r\n\r\npermission from the Government to do so and it will\r\n\r\nbe  seen  from here that even if we are to  have  a\r\n\r\nmanhole  in the ground or lay electrical  equipment\r\n\r\non  the land, we have to seek permission to do  so.\r\n\r\nThese  powers, as I say, are vested  in  the  local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthorities.  So  why  should  there  be   such   a\r\n\r\nrepetition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is stated in the Bill that an appeal can\r\n\r\nbe  made to the Minister if a plan is not approved.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that  it  is the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to appoint an Appeals Board to hear such\r\n\r\nappeals.   There   is  nothing   said   about   the\r\n\r\ncomposition of this Board. We have the  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals  Board  very  clearly  stated  in  our\r\n\r\nEducation   Bill   and  also   in   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Ordinance. Why should  the  Government\r\n\r\nnot  state the composition of the Appeals Board  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  so that the people can be assured  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  receive  a proper hearing,  unlike  the\r\n\r\ntreatment   they   receive   from   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement   Trust?   The  officers   there   have\r\n\r\ndiscussed your case long before you go in and  when\r\n\r\nyou do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  in  they just ask a few questions. They do  not\r\n\r\ntell  you  anything  but they say  that  they  will\r\n\r\ndiscuss  it  afterwards. That kind of procedure  is\r\n\r\nmost  unsatisfactory.  We know  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers  in  the  Planning Department  are  highly\r\n\r\ncorrupted.  When  I  say  that  they  are   \"highly\r\n\r\ncorrupted\",  I am not saying it without foundation.\r\n\r\nThe   Police  have  made  extensive  enquiries  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough  no one has come forward to give  evidence\r\n\r\non  the  matter, I am sure the Police must come  to\r\n\r\nthe conclusion that there are grounds for suspicion\r\n\r\nalthough  such allegations of corruption  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen proved. The members of the Board are comprised\r\n\r\nof  people who have admitted to me that they do not\r\n\r\nknow  much about the working of the Board.  I  have\r\n\r\ninterviewed   a   few   of  them,   including   the\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the P.A.P. They told me that they\r\n\r\nwere  entirely  ignorant of what  was  stated  down\r\n\r\nthere,  which  I think is no fault of theirs.  They\r\n\r\nare  laymen  after  all.  In  fact,  the  so-called\r\n\r\nPlanning  Committee is entirely  dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nopinion of one or two officers concerned. They  may\r\n\r\ntell you, \"Oh, this desk is too high and so on  and\r\n\r\nso  on,\"  but  there is no one to  argue  over  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  They will not tell you exactly  what  they\r\n\r\nare  objecting to. Before you go in, they may  tell\r\n\r\nthe  Committee members all sorts of lies. They have\r\n\r\nreason  to tell lies. So what is the use of appeal?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the Planning Committee? It is  a\r\n\r\nfarce. The people are told, \"Oh, yes, you are given\r\n\r\na  chance to appeal before the Planning Committee.\"\r\n\r\nBut  what chance have you? The verdict has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  decided  before you go in.  So  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should put down the names of the members\r\n\r\nof this Appeals Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 17 of the Bill they want to provide\r\n\r\nrules  to control the development of land.  Yes,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  should.  The  control  of  density  of\r\n\r\nbuildings on land - they should have too. But clause 17 (2) (c):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the regulation of the height, design, appearance\r\n\r\nand siting of buildings;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Design,  Sir, is a most controversial  subject.  If\r\n\r\nyou  have  ten prominent architects,  it  is  quite\r\n\r\npossible they may differ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentirely  as to the type of design which should  be\r\n\r\nput  up.  For instance, the United Nations building\r\n\r\nin  New  York.  The job was given to  a  number  of\r\n\r\narchitects  after  long  consideration  and   after\r\n\r\nsubmission of a lot of designs from architects  all\r\n\r\nover   the  world.  Yet  the  amount  of  criticism\r\n\r\nreceived  from other architects who were not  doing\r\n\r\nthe  job  is  shocking. It is  the  same  with  the\r\n\r\nR.I.B.A.   Headquarters  building  in   London.   I\r\n\r\nremember  seeing designs for it in the competition.\r\n\r\nArchitects  from  all  over the  Commonwealth  were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvited  to  submit designs for the  building.  The\r\n\r\ndesigns  ranged from ultramodern to full classical.\r\n\r\nIf  you look at the names of the architects who had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubmitted  designs, you can never doubt  that  they\r\n\r\nare men who have knowledge of building and who have\r\n\r\nput  up  maybe hundreds and thousands of  buildings\r\n\r\nall  over the world. Yet they differed to  a  great\r\n\r\nextent    over   the   design   of   the   R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do the Government really think they have\r\n\r\nenough  men to decide the design of this place?  On\r\n\r\nwhom are they relying? If they say on a few of  the\r\n\r\narchitects  in the so-called Housing  Authority  or\r\n\r\nPlanning Authority, I think it is a great disgrace.\r\n\r\nIt   is  really  an  insult  to  the  architectural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofession of Singapore. A number of years ago, the\r\n\r\nGovernment decided to sell the land in Shenton  Way\r\n\r\nalong  Robinson  Road. They  called  for  bids  for\r\n\r\nauction. I remember very distinctly that one of the\r\n\r\nconditions  is  that  you must follow  the  designs\r\n\r\nentirely as shown in the drawings. You cannot build\r\n\r\nhigher or lower, and building throughout the  whole\r\n\r\nof  Shenton  Way in Robinson Road must  be  in  one\r\n\r\nhorizontal line. That was submitted to very  severe\r\n\r\ncriticism  from  the  architectural  profession  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Yet  the  Government,  through   their\r\n\r\nadvisers,  imposed  such conditions.  They  imposed\r\n\r\nsuch conditions because they knew very well that no\r\n\r\none  dared  to say no to them. But today I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  sort of thing should never be allowed  to  be\r\n\r\nrepeated.  I think one of the reasons why  most  of\r\n\r\nthe land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Shenton  Way  is  still vacant is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nunreasonable conditions imposed by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Which Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> The previous Government, of course,\r\n\r\nSir.

Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsince this Bill is going to Select Committee, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  I will take up much of the time of the Assembly;\r\n\r\nbut it would appear to me that the criticisms raised by\r\n\r\nthe Members for Paya Lebar and Pasir Panjang revolve on\r\n\r\none  theme, and that is the passing of plans. There  is\r\n\r\nsome  slight change in the present Bill before  us.  It\r\n\r\nwould be better, I think, to have the wording in clause\r\n\r\n9 (11) as it is, that is to say, if within three months\r\n\r\nof  the date of receipt by the Competent Authority  the\r\n\r\nplans are not passed, then the application is deemed to\r\n\r\nhave been refused. This would be better than having  it\r\n\r\nthe  other  way round, because it would mean  that  the\r\n\r\nplans have been approved by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang, and that is on corruption.

You will remember. Sir, at the last sitting\r\n\r\nof the Assembly that the Member for Queenstown raised a\r\n\r\nsimilar  point  on  corruption  in  connection  with  a\r\n\r\ncertain house in Dorset\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad.

It  is  proposed  that   express\r\n\r\nprovision should be made for the imposition of duty\r\n\r\nin  terms  similar to those used  in  these  former\r\n\r\nOrdinances to remove all doubts by relating it back\r\n\r\nto  the  date  on which the Customs Ordinance  came\r\n\r\ninto operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of administrative convenience, it is\r\n\r\nconsidered that the Comptroller should be  able  to\r\n\r\ncollect  the  heavy  oil  tax  at  staggered  dates\r\n\r\nthroughout  the year at the same time and  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  periods as the Registrar of Vehicles collects\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicle licence fees.
