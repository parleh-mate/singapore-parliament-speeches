It\r\n\r\nis  envisaged that the powers of the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMarine  of  the  Federation  in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nRegister should be exercised in Singapore  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Marine, Singapore, but  the  officer\r\n\r\nexercising such functions is known in Singapore by\r\n\r\nthe title of Master Attendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is before the House the Merchant Shipping\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Bill  and  one  of  the   amendments\r\n\r\nprovides for the change of the title of the Master\r\n\r\nAttendant  to that of Director of Marine.

The change that has taken place  is\r\n\r\na  basic mutation in the role and jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\nthis  House.  Many of the forms and  rituals  have\r\n\r\nremained. But some Members may have noted that the\r\n\r\nguns   did  not  boom  out  in  salute  when   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara arrived  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber to deliver His speech on the 29th  of\r\n\r\nNovember.   It  did  not,  because   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment ruled it to be so. They are in  control\r\n\r\nof  the  Army  which  includes  the  two  Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiments of Singapore, and their practice is that\r\n\r\nno   ceremonial  salutes  will  be  given  to  any\r\n\r\nGovernor  of  Penang or Malacca or  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara of Singapore. In a small  way,  it\r\n\r\nsymbolises a shift in authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too those Members who were with us in the last\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  have noted that the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply on the Budget has been reduced from five to\r\n\r\nthree  days  with their concurrence, as  they  did\r\n\r\nnot, quite rightly, raise any objections. For  the\r\n\r\nmatters to be discussed no longer include  a  list\r\n\r\nranging  from  Police, Prisons and Army  to  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation,   Meteorological   Office,   Posts   and\r\n\r\nTelecommunications, Audit. These are  all  now  in\r\n\r\nthe  jurisdiction  of the Central  Government.  It\r\n\r\nmeans,  in  effect,  that ultimate  power  is  now\r\n\r\nvested  in  the  Parliament of Malaysia,  and  any\r\n\r\npolitical  movement or Party that  wishes  to  re-order the state of our society will have to assume\r\n\r\nauthority for all Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, stated on many a previous occasion\r\n\r\nthat  there  can  be no Communist Singapore  until\r\n\r\nthere is first a Communist Malaya and that whoever\r\n\r\nwishes  to  make  Singapore Communist  must  first\r\n\r\ncapture power in Malaya. Sir, an analysis  of  the\r\n\r\npower  situation  which  has  existed  since  1948\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and  Malaya  is  now  formally\r\n\r\ntranslated into the provisions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution   of   Malaysia.

I think that  is\r\n\r\na  sobering  reminder to Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nof the magnitude of the obstacles that lie between\r\n\r\nthem and their political ambitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed it is a truth, which has to be faced by\r\n\r\nwhichever  political movement that wishes  to  win\r\n\r\nauthority  and the right to reshape the  structure\r\n\r\nof our economy and our society, that we must first\r\n\r\nwin  the  majority  of  the  number  of  seats  in\r\n\r\nParliament,   the  Parliament  of  Malaysia,   and\r\n\r\ncommand  a loyalty of the administration  and  the\r\n\r\nobedience of the Army and the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have so many matters, including\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of our revenue, still reserved  for\r\n\r\nthe  State Government does not alter the fact that\r\n\r\nwe  are  part  of  Malaysia and our  influence  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will be determined not by the number  of\r\n\r\nseats that Singapore has in Parliament but by  the\r\n\r\nexample that she can set for the rest of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nan  example of the possibilities opening up vistas\r\n\r\nof  progress  and  prosperity which  can  be  more\r\n\r\nequally  shared  by all if similar  policies  were\r\n\r\nadopted at the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our influence over the deliberations of\r\n\r\nParliament   in  the  policies  of   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment has yet to be felt. Much will depend on\r\n\r\nwhat happens in the elections in Malaya next year.\r\n\r\nEverybody concedes that the U.M.N.O. side  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  can  and will win a clear majority.  But\r\n\r\neverybody  is waiting to see what happens  to  the\r\n\r\nvote  in the urban areas and in all the main towns\r\n\r\nin  Malaya,  for  arising out of that  vote,  some\r\n\r\nvital  decisions  will have to  be  made  both  by\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. leaders and by us in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fairly obvious that if it were possible for\r\n\r\nthe  M.C.A. to hold the towns in Malaya, then  the\r\n\r\npresent  structure of the Central  Government  and\r\n\r\nthe policies it pursues can go on unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the towns decisively reject all M.C.A.\r\n\r\ncandidates,  then there must be a re-appraisal  by\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey will then have to decide whether they come to\r\n\r\nterms  with  the leadership that can  command  the\r\n\r\nloyalty  of  the  sophisticated  urban  population\r\n\r\n- Chinese, Indians, Eurasians and others - or govern\r\n\r\nwithout the partnership of the leadership  of  the\r\n\r\ntowns.  It is when this moment is reached sometime\r\n\r\nnext  year that the bits and pieces will fall into\r\n\r\ntheir   proper  places  in  the  Malaysian  scene.\r\n\r\nThereafter,  the  facts of life in  Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nhave to be faced by all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a struggle for authority to remould our\r\n\r\nsociety  now  in the much bigger Malaysian  arena,\r\n\r\nand  the  outcome of this struggle  is  final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy is that in quite a number of these\r\n\r\ntowns  in Malaya there is no coherent constructive\r\n\r\nalternative. Yet in spite of this, there could  be\r\n\r\na  massive protest vote registered not so much for\r\n\r\nthe   Communist  manipulated  Parties   like   the\r\n\r\nSocialist Front, the Labour Party, Party  Ra'kyat,\r\n\r\nbut    a    vote   against   the   present   urban\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and their records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But meanwhile let us confine ourselves to the\r\n\r\nimmediate  issues in Singapore. In many  ways  the\r\n\r\nissues  and the position of the Parties  are  much\r\n\r\nclearer  to  everyone. The line that  divides  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Opposition is between those who\r\n\r\nare  for  Malaysia and our survival in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia  as  a  separate political  entity,  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, a front for the Communists  who,\r\n\r\nfor  their own selfish ends, have tried to prevent\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and so prevent merger; and who even  now\r\n\r\nafter  the  creation of Malaysia, are still  anti-Malaysia and against the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a time in October, some six weeks\r\n\r\nago, when it looked as though with the creation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia   the   Communists   would   accept   its\r\n\r\nestablishment and try to win within. But there are\r\n\r\nincreasing   signs  that  they  have  decided   to\r\n\r\ncontinue their anti-Malaysia struggle, even though\r\n\r\nthis  means  that  they are more and  more  openly\r\n\r\nidentified with outside forces, like the Communist\r\n\r\nParty in Indonesia, who are out to crush Malaysia.\r\n\r\nNational service they have condemned, and  in  its\r\n\r\nplace is their pious suggestion that we should beg\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe   allowed  to  live  in  peace,  presumably  by\r\n\r\nabandoning  Sabah and Sarawak to their fate.  This\r\n\r\nis the line of treachery and betrayal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a line likely to win them popular\r\n\r\nsupport.   I   think  they  are  caught   in   the\r\n\r\nintricacies of their own international conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe  line has been laid for them and they have  to\r\n\r\ngo  on plugging it even if it means losing out  in\r\n\r\npopular  support  within Malaysia.  However,  they\r\n\r\nwill  try to win support by their exploitation  of\r\n\r\nChinese  educational issues, by  the  capture  and\r\n\r\ncontrol of trade unions, and manipulation of civic\r\n\r\norganisations both in the city and  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas. In short, the battle continues on the  same\r\n\r\nold issues over the same old battlefields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the political complexion of this Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday  reflects  more  accurately  the  respective\r\n\r\nstrength  of  ground  feeling and  the  respective\r\n\r\nsupport for competing ideologies. We represent the\r\n\r\nmajority, who prefer the sometimes slower but less\r\n\r\ndrastic progress towards a more equal but  a  more\r\n\r\nhumane  society. They represent the  frustrations,\r\n\r\nhatreds  and  bitterness of  a  minority  who  are\r\n\r\nideologically convinced that no government  but  a\r\n\r\nCommunist one can provide a permanent solution  to\r\n\r\nour  economic and social evils. We who have  known\r\n\r\nthem  for so long know that they are very far from\r\n\r\ngiving up their struggle. Their top leaders  never\r\n\r\ncame  out in Singapore to be expended. It was only\r\n\r\nthe  second rank leaders put in the first line  of\r\n\r\nthe  open front struggle who have been sacrificed.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  battle will go on relentlessly. We  must\r\n\r\ncontinue from time to time to spotlight them every\r\n\r\nnow and again when they are up to mischief and  to\r\n\r\nexpose them. The Barisan must be shown to be still\r\n\r\na   Communist  front  exploiting  the   name   and\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  the  democratic  system  with  the\r\n\r\npurpose of destroying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under our new Constitution, this\r\n\r\nLegislative  Chamber will be more  concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  constructive  aspect of government  - schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals,  housing,  community  centres,   roads,\r\n\r\nbridges,  drains,  parks, and, most  important  of\r\n\r\nall, factories. For only the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  base  which we  are  now  forging  can\r\n\r\nprovide a better life for us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years of this Chamber so much of\r\n\r\nthe  time  of this House was preoccupied with  the\r\n\r\nstruggle for independence. It was inevitable  that\r\n\r\nwe   should  be  preoccupied  then  with  national\r\n\r\nfreedom  and  the  right  to  determine  our   own\r\n\r\ndestiny.  It was inevitable that in the Opposition\r\n\r\nyears  of 1955-59, I myself had taken up the  time\r\n\r\nof  this  House on the problems of how we were  to\r\n\r\nachieve  freedom. But I had hoped  that  with  the\r\n\r\nattainment  of  full  internal self-government  in\r\n\r\nJune  1959  we would have begun to look  into  the\r\n\r\nconstructive side of government - how to  create  a\r\n\r\nbetter society and provide higher living standards\r\n\r\nfor  all,  how to create higher social values  and\r\n\r\ncivic  responsibility. But that was not to be  so.\r\n\r\nFor  the  Communists, it was vital  that  progress\r\n\r\nshould  be  minimal. For the more we progress  the\r\n\r\nless likely an eventual Communist victory. And  so\r\n\r\nthe  destructive debate went on about the  Police,\r\n\r\nPrisons, defence bases and anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubts that they will pursue these\r\n\r\nissues in Parliament in Kuala Lumpur. But we would\r\n\r\nbe  foolish  to believe that because  we  are  now\r\n\r\nindependent, therefore the Communists  will  admit\r\n\r\nthat   there   is   a  duty   on   the   part   of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people to construct and not\r\n\r\nto  destroy.  They cannot admit that any  national\r\n\r\nconstruction  is possible until all economic  ties\r\n\r\nand military alliances with any Western bloc power\r\n\r\nhave been destroyed. And now since colonialism  is\r\n\r\nno  longer there, they have to say that the  fight\r\n\r\nmust   be   against  new  colonialism,  or   \"neo-colonialism\" as they have chosen to call it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the division between this side of the House\r\n\r\nand  the  Opposition  is deep  and  abiding.  They\r\n\r\nrepresent  a minority, but a militant and  tightly\r\n\r\nknit  minority determined to bring the  democratic\r\n\r\nstate down and establish a Communist regime.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  on  this  side of the House are privileged  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  chosen to represent the majority,  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the people who want Malaysia to live  in\r\n\r\npeace  and to progress unmolested. We are a  Party\r\n\r\ndedicated to democratic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocialism.  But  it is our duty to recognise  that\r\n\r\nthe  only long-term basis on which national  unity\r\n\r\ncan  be forged and stability ensured is for us  to\r\n\r\nbind  all those sectors of society who reject  the\r\n\r\nsoul-less creed of a Communist dictatorship as the\r\n\r\nonly  answer to our undoubtedly many social evils.\r\n\r\nAnd  we are proud that in the process we have been\r\n\r\nable  to  convince large sectors of the  community\r\n\r\n- from  labourers  to  wealthy  merchants  and  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  and middle classes -that  the  long-term answer to the Communist challenge lies in  an\r\n\r\nhonest  and effective administration, a government\r\n\r\nwhose social and economic policies can bring about\r\n\r\nan  appreciable  and  a  visible  equalisation  of\r\n\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would be breaking faith with the mass of the\r\n\r\npeople  who voted for us this time if we  did  not\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  we represent,  as  the  governing\r\n\r\nParty, a broad cross-section of the community.  We\r\n\r\nmust recognise further that their aspirations  are\r\n\r\nto  have  a  more equal society through  the  more\r\n\r\ndifficult   process  of  levelling  up   and   not\r\n\r\nlevelling  down.  In this city of pushful  people,\r\n\r\nenergetic  and hard working, largely of  immigrant\r\n\r\nstock,  the  desire is that there should  be  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for everyone to work harder  and  to\r\n\r\ndo  better  and increase the size of the  national\r\n\r\ncake  as much as, if not more than, the desire  to\r\n\r\nshare the cake more equally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would be doing a disservice to the\r\n\r\ncountry  if  we  misled the people into  believing\r\n\r\nthat  just  because this last time the  Communists\r\n\r\nwere   defeated  they  would  thereby  remain   an\r\n\r\nimpotent  force. There are already signs of  their\r\n\r\npicking  up  the  bits and pieces  left  of  their\r\n\r\norganisation  wrecked by the  disastrous  policies\r\n\r\nthey  have  pursued.  And we  cannot  expect  them\r\n\r\nalways to be so accommodating in the next round to\r\n\r\ncontinue  making false and erroneous  assumptions.\r\n\r\nBut  however skilful they are, they face this  one\r\n\r\ncrucial  test:  what  is  their  attitude  to  the\r\n\r\nconstructive  side  of nation building?  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  however  much  they  can  play  up   anti-neocolonialism,  can  they  really  persuade   the\r\n\r\npeople that construction should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nset  aside, indefinitely until neo-colonialism has\r\n\r\nbeen destroyed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to enumerate the four principal\r\n\r\ntargets  of constructive effort in the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is industrialisation. A climate of\r\n\r\nconfidence   exists  both  in  the  stability   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  in  the  known  policies   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government. The only factor that  could\r\n\r\nupset  this climate of overwhelming confidence  is\r\n\r\nif  confrontation were to hot up into  a  military\r\n\r\nadventure. This is a factor beyond our control. We\r\n\r\ncan  only  hope that the major world  powers  will\r\n\r\nalways  have  their own interests to  preserve  to\r\n\r\nensure that there is no accidental conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one important factor within our\r\n\r\ncompetence    to    ensure    the    success    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  and  that  is  the  supply  of\r\n\r\nskilled efficient workers who are not embroiled in\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  conspiracy of united  front  trade\r\n\r\nunions, who are organised into unions designed  to\r\n\r\nfurther  the interests of workers as such and  not\r\n\r\nexploited  for political purposes by united  front\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second target is housing and the rebuilding\r\n\r\nof  the  old city. We plan to build 60,000 housing\r\n\r\nunits  in  the  next five years. We are  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the target can be achieved in spite  of  the\r\n\r\ntemporary setback of Indonesian confrontation. And\r\n\r\nthere is every hope that when the 8.7 per cent gap\r\n\r\nin  our national income is recovered in two  years\r\n\r\nand  our industries begin to flourish, we may well\r\n\r\nexceed  this target of 60,000 housing  units.  But\r\n\r\nthe  amount  by which we will exceed  this  target\r\n\r\ndepends  very  largely  on  the  growth   of   our\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the first phase of the rebuilding of\r\n\r\nthe  central city has begun. Outram Road  Gaol  is\r\n\r\nbeing demolished to house eventually some 7,000 to\r\n\r\n10,000   families.  And  if  building  by  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers,  which  is  again  dependent  on   our\r\n\r\neconomic progress, keeps increasing at the rate it\r\n\r\nhas done over the last three years, then it is not\r\n\r\nunlikely  that in five years, one-quarter  of  the\r\n\r\nold city would have been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third target is education. It is already a\r\n\r\nnear miracle that we can now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafford  to  have all children in primary  schools.\r\n\r\nForward  planning for construction of schools  and\r\n\r\nthe  training of teachers will keep up  with  this\r\n\r\never-increasing  demand.  Our   next   target   in\r\n\r\neducation  is to increase the secondary vocational\r\n\r\nschools  so that children who are more  suited  to\r\n\r\nwork  with  their hands and eyes than their  minds\r\n\r\nwill  not fritter away their years between leaving\r\n\r\nprimary school and getting their first job. And it\r\n\r\nis  essential  that we build up a  whole  army  of\r\n\r\ntechnicians  which  a  modern  industrial  society\r\n\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one special problem in education is how to\r\n\r\ncheck   the   nation  from  being  undermined   by\r\n\r\nCommunist groups recruiting and training  in  some\r\n\r\nChinese  schools  and  in Nanyang  University.  In\r\n\r\nNanyang University the Communists may confuse some\r\n\r\npeople   into  believing  that  action  meant   to\r\n\r\nrestrict their conspiracy is a violation  of  some\r\n\r\nsacred principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang University Council has hitherto\r\n\r\nspurned  every Government grant to help  it  raise\r\n\r\nits standards and put its organisation into shape,\r\n\r\nlargely  because the Communists have been able  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  some  leaders of the Chinese  merchant\r\n\r\ncommunity  who have pretensions to greatness,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  to inherit the mantle of another  Chinese\r\n\r\npatriot like the late Mr Tan Kah Kee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nanyang University with their financial\r\n\r\nautonomy  leaving  them in an academic  morass,  a\r\n\r\nsituation  is developing which, if left  unchecked\r\n\r\nwithin  five years, will make it more a University\r\n\r\nof  Yenan than of Nanyang with young pro-Communist\r\n\r\ngraduates  and  student leaders  manipulating  the\r\n\r\nentire  governing  Council of Nanyang  University.\r\n\r\nProfessors and lecturers on year-to-year contracts\r\n\r\nrenewable  at  will  by the  Council  cannot  have\r\n\r\neconomic  security,  let alone  academic  freedom.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  problem  of  Nanyang  can  never  be\r\n\r\nresolved  until the political abuse the Communists\r\n\r\nmake of it is exposed and stopped. Only a few days\r\n\r\nago,   the  Communists  manipulated  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   Students'  Union   which   issued   a\r\n\r\nstatement  declaring that the  University  Council\r\n\r\nshould discontinue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  the  Government  on   aid   and\r\n\r\nreorganisation and refuse any financial aid unless\r\n\r\ngiven unconditionally and without supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the duty of the Government to raise\r\n\r\nacademic  standards in Nanyang University  and  to\r\n\r\ngive  it  as  much assistance as it gives  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore. But it is also  the  duty\r\n\r\nof  the Government to see that none of this  money\r\n\r\nis  allowed  to  be expended on strengthening  the\r\n\r\nintellectual  cadre  of  the  Communist  Party  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  And it is our duty to see that this  does\r\n\r\nnot   take   place,  whether  it  is  in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  or, for that matter, in the University\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be satisfied that the authority and\r\n\r\ndiscipline of the academic staff and of  a  proper\r\n\r\ngoverning council of responsible people comprising\r\n\r\nthe   founders  of  Nanyang  University  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  States  of Malaya, the  Senate,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  provides  the  funds,   is   not\r\n\r\nmanipulated and controlled by the Communists.  And\r\n\r\nMembers will agree that it is not the business  of\r\n\r\nour  Government to give money to help  train  more\r\n\r\nCommunist cadres to destroy the democratic  State.\r\n\r\nBut  we  must deal with this problem as delicately\r\n\r\nas  the sensitiveness of the problem requires. But\r\n\r\nin  the  end  the truth will be established,  that\r\n\r\nthere is a state of affairs in which a small group\r\n\r\nof militant Chinese Communists from Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchools  exploiting the egoism  of  some  merchant\r\n\r\nmillionaires   with  pretensions   to   fame   and\r\n\r\ngreatness have established their control over  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  When  a professor  can  be  asked  to\r\n\r\nexplain  why certain students fail, then  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  has not just been destroyed. Near anarchy\r\n\r\nhas set in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth target is the raising of social\r\n\r\nstandards. By social standards I do not mean  only\r\n\r\nan  increase in our social and cultural amenities,\r\n\r\nhowever important they are - unemployment benefits,\r\n\r\nsickness  benefits, scholarships and bursaries  to\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools  and  universities,  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  television, or the National  Theatre.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to emphasise higher standards of public  and\r\n\r\nsocial conduct.

But slowly  as\r\n\r\nsocial    standards   and   civic    consciousness\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly  increase,  hawkers  for  instance\r\n\r\nbegin to understand that they must stay out of the\r\n\r\nmain  traffic routes and that they must for  their\r\n\r\nown sake maintain certain standards of cleanliness\r\n\r\nand hygiene. Litter, rubbish, flies and mosquitoes\r\n\r\nare  not  only the job of the Health Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the Cleansing Department, but  the\r\n\r\nsocial responsibility of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are realists enough to know that in trying to\r\n\r\nachieve  these four targets which I have  sketched\r\n\r\nin  broad  outlines  we must anticipate  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  and  their   Communist   front\r\n\r\norganisations will become more and more skilful in\r\n\r\ntheir  tactics to obstruct and prevent Singapore's\r\n\r\nsuccess. In thwarting industrialisation, they  can\r\n\r\ncreate  unrest  in labour unions and  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ninsecurity to prospective investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that they will also become more skilful\r\n\r\nin  camouflaging  their tactics  of  blocking  the\r\n\r\nclearance  of sites for housing, schools,  clinics\r\n\r\nand other development plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stage has been set for the next five\r\n\r\nyears.   We   can   and  we  will   succeed.   The\r\n\r\nConstitution and responsibilities of this Assembly\r\n\r\nhave  been  changed, if anything, for the  better.\r\n\r\nWhilst we as a State Assembly may not have so many\r\n\r\nmatters  to  look  after, we have  enough  of  the\r\n\r\nconstructive  side  to make  our  sittings  useful\r\n\r\noccasions when progress can be reviewed and faults\r\n\r\nremedied. It would be useful at these sittings  if\r\n\r\ncriticism of our shortcomings either in policy  or\r\n\r\nimplementation  were  aired  not   only   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition but also by our Back benchers.  It  can\r\n\r\nserve   a   useful  purpose  in  bringing   public\r\n\r\nattention to how things are done, how they can  be\r\n\r\ndone better, or why an apparent ineptitude has  in\r\n\r\nfact a rational and valid explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nsince  our  first sitting in October  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  through  its  Chairman,  has  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement  in  which they clearly expressed  their\r\n\r\nintention to downgrade the value of this  Chamber.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt  partly as a result of his  unprofitable\r\n\r\neffort  in the last Assembly, the Chairman of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,   the   former   Member    for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, has stated that what is more important\r\n\r\nis  what  they  do  outside  and  not  inside  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  and  Parliament.  Obviously\r\n\r\nthey  have  come to realise that people  were  not\r\n\r\nimpressed  with the marathon speeches  and  futile\r\n\r\ndebates  we  had in the last Assembly,  and  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  so.  But I believe that this Chamber  can\r\n\r\nserve a useful function to spotlight the hopes and\r\n\r\naspirations of the people, to underline the duties\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, to point out where it can  do\r\n\r\nmore,   and  finally  to  bring  about  a  greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding of our problems and to  improve  our\r\n\r\neffort to build a better Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must never be afraid of departing from\r\n\r\naccepted  and  habitual practice  either  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber or outside. And it is for this reason that\r\n\r\nI  invite  our own Back benchers to criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in this Chamber for what they  consider\r\n\r\nto  be  shortcomings, even though this may not  be\r\n\r\nthe  practice  elsewhere. For all of  us  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber must realise that the mental attitudes and\r\n\r\nresponses  of the mass of the people outside  this\r\n\r\nChamber  are  very  different from  those  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who elect representatives to the House  of\r\n\r\nCommons in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gathered valuable experience from our\r\n\r\ndifficulties  over the last ten years.  To  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the democratic system prevails, we must  not\r\n\r\nonly  ensure that there is an honest and effective\r\n\r\nGovernment  that produces results.  What  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant is that we must also ensure that  it  is\r\n\r\nable to keep in touch with the mass of the people,\r\n\r\nto  produce those results in a form and manner the\r\n\r\npeople   generally  consider  desirable,  and   to\r\n\r\nprevent the Communists from distorting the success\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government or subverting public loyalties  by\r\n\r\npressure and manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years, Members will see the\r\n\r\ngrowth in my office of a special department  which\r\n\r\nwill help to create and build up a whole series of\r\n\r\ngrass-root  organisations  in  every  village,  in\r\n\r\nevery  street,  and in every major community.

For in  the\r\n\r\nend not only must we succeed in making Singapore a\r\n\r\nbetter place, but we must also succeed in building\r\n\r\nup  an organisational structure within the country\r\n\r\nthat  can  help strengthen the links  between  the\r\n\r\npeople and their Government so that the best  that\r\n\r\ncan  be done will be done in their interests.

It is indeed a new\r\n\r\nchapter, not of so-called independence -because to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, the P.A.P. merger merely\r\n\r\nmeans   a   change  of  masters  - but  of  Fascist\r\n\r\nrepressions carried out by imperialist agents  and\r\n\r\nstooges  against political opponents  and  against\r\n\r\nanti-colonial stalwarts; of Fascist violations  of\r\n\r\nthe  basic democratic rights and freedoms  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, of Fascist brutal assaults by fully  armed\r\n\r\npolice  on workers who carry out a peaceful strike\r\n\r\nin defence of their basic right of association; of\r\n\r\narbitrary arrests and detentions without charge or\r\n\r\ntrial;  of  fresh  attempts by neo-colonialism  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate the hopes and aspirations of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people; and of fresh attempts by self-seeking\r\n\r\npoliticians to mislead and deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new chapter did not start on 16th September.\r\n\r\nIt  started  long  before  Malaysia  Day.  It  had\r\n\r\nstarted when plans were being completed to  impose\r\n\r\nneo-colonialist  Malaysia on the  people.  British\r\n\r\nimperialism   had   resorted  to   open   military\r\n\r\nsuppression of the national uprising in Brunei  on\r\n\r\n8th  December,  1962. Soon after,  there  followed\r\n\r\narbitrary   arrests   and   detention   of   those\r\n\r\nuncompromisingly  opposed to  Malaysia,  first  in\r\n\r\nSarawak in December 1962 and then in Singapore  in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of British backing, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. stooges  gave free rein to  their  Fascist\r\n\r\ntendencies. They proceeded step by step to violate\r\n\r\nall  the  basic democratic rights and freedoms  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detainees were given inhuman and barbaric\r\n\r\ntreatment of prolonged solitary confinement.  Even\r\n\r\nAssemblymen were arbitrarily arrested on unfounded\r\n\r\ncharges  and  unceremoniously  deprived  of  their\r\n\r\nbasic  human  rights. So-called  criminal  charges\r\n\r\nwere magnified and distorted out of all proportion\r\n\r\nto  suit  the evil designs of the P.A.P. When  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. began   preparing  for  a  snap   general\r\n\r\nelection, the Barisan was denied even its right as\r\n\r\na  political  Party to hold open air rallies,  and\r\n\r\nthe  funds of S.A.T.U. unions were frozen  on  the\r\n\r\nwhimsical  excuse  that their  union  members  had\r\n\r\nbooed the Prime Minister at a mass rally!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the official proclamation of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhen sovereignty over Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah\r\n\r\nwas  handed  over by the United Kingdom Government\r\n\r\nto   the  Federation  Government,  the  stage  was\r\n\r\nfinally  set  for yet further repressive  measures\r\n\r\nagainst   political  opponents   and   progressive\r\n\r\norganisations and individuals in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to remind the House of what is\r\n\r\nstill fresh in the minds of all in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\naction  to revoke the citizenship of Mr Tan  Lark\r\n\r\nSye; the arrest of Nanyang students, graduates and\r\n\r\nBarisan  candidates;  the sudden  banning  without\r\n\r\nwarning  of five rural and hawkers' organisations;\r\n\r\nthe  October  arrests of trade union  leaders  and\r\n\r\nBarisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssemblymen;   the  brutal  assault   on   workers\r\n\r\ncarrying out a peaceful protest strike in  defence\r\n\r\nof their right to join unions of their own choice;\r\n\r\nthe  banning of seven large unions of the S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\ngroup;   the  Government's  refusal  to   register\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. after two years of de facto  recognition\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  locally and  by  other  world\r\n\r\norganisations internationally; the breaking of the\r\n\r\nlawful  strike  at the Naval Base, etc.  All  this\r\n\r\nbears  testimony  to the Fascist,  pro-colonialist\r\n\r\nand pro-imperialist nature of the P.A.P. Yes, this\r\n\r\nis  a  new chapter. It is a new chapter of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nFascism  and  its  active collaboration  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government  in   repression   against\r\n\r\neffective  opposition, under the protective  cover\r\n\r\nof   British   imperialism   and   neo-colonialist\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is obvious to all that, though the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. dares to be intimidatory and overbearing to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  the  P.A.P. is  ever\r\n\r\nservile and subservient to its imperialist masters\r\n\r\nand their allies and agents in the Federation. The\r\n\r\npeople will not easily forget the citizenship sell-out  and the financial sell-out. More and more can\r\n\r\nthey  now  see  that  it  is  because  of  selfish\r\n\r\ninterests that the P.A.P. had gone out of its  way\r\n\r\nto  promote Malaysia. For its slavish labours, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was   given  full  support   by   British\r\n\r\nimperialism in the unfair snap general  elections,\r\n\r\nand  today the P.A.P. is once again in office. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership must be well satisfied with  the\r\n\r\nrewards  for  its  service to  neo-colonialism  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the people? The 1.8 million, nay, 10\r\n\r\nmillion  people  if  we  include  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nSarawak   and   Sabah,  who   now   face   extreme\r\n\r\ndifficulties in the days ahead? There is  economic\r\n\r\nconfrontation  but,  according  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara's  speech,  the  P.A.P. expects\r\n\r\nindustrial success and prosperity in spite of  the\r\n\r\nsetback in the trading sector!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that there will be more industrial\r\n\r\nenterprise and we do not doubt that there will  be\r\n\r\nforeign establishments that are ever ready to make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  advantages of pioneer industries  to\r\n\r\nfurther exploit the people in the country. But  it\r\n\r\ndoes not necessarily follow from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  that  there will be industrial  success  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  for the people. In fact, it  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat   with  the  present  dependence  on  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments,  there will be no genuine  prosperity\r\n\r\nfor the vast majority of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of those who depend on trade for their\r\n\r\nlivelihood?  For  the thousands and  thousands  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who depend on trade for their livelihood\r\n\r\n- and  Singapore lives by trade as admitted by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  - the  future will be bleak indeed,  unless\r\n\r\nsomething  radical and drastic be done to  rectify\r\n\r\nthe errors immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget statement makes no bones about\r\n\r\nconfrontation being a severe blow and setting back\r\n\r\nthe  time-table  two  years. But  the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\npromoted  Malaysia and confrontation  and  brought\r\n\r\nthe  consequent  hardships, and  it  would  be  to\r\n\r\nP.A.P. advantage  to  minimise  the  effects   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation   of   Singapore's   economy.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment,   therefore,  refers   to   sufficient\r\n\r\nreserves \"to see us through to industrial  success\r\n\r\nand  prosperity\"! Let us ask: how \"sufficient\" are\r\n\r\nthe  reserves? What happens when the reserves  are\r\n\r\nfinished?  Where then is the so-called prosperity?\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister himself has warned the  people\r\n\r\nof  indefinite confrontation. Yet how  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsuggests to us that we can make up for the loss of\r\n\r\ntrade and earnings within two years! How does  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. reconcile these two statements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the whole speech is nothing but another piece of P.A.P. propaganda. It talks of social revolution and the hoped-for P.A.P. achievements in the fields of education, health, housing, welfare and rural development and labour (which I shall come to by and by). It gives a one-sided account of its efforts and, confrontation\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding, tells the House that  there  will\r\n\r\nstill  be prosperity. But it also hastens  to  say\r\n\r\nthat,  since  control over defence,  security  and\r\n\r\nforeign affairs, and overall financial and  fiscal\r\n\r\npowers   are   in  the  hands  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, therefore, the decision of our fate is\r\n\r\nin  the  Central Government. In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. says that it cannot be blamed if things  go\r\n\r\nwrong  in  Singapore! And we all know that  things\r\n\r\nare daily getting worse in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To absolve itself from blame, the P.A.P. says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  doing everything  it  can  to  bring\r\n\r\nprosperity to the people, and that because of  its\r\n\r\npast   efforts,  there  is  prosperity  now.   If,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the  P.A.P.'s  efforts  fail  to   bring\r\n\r\ngreater  prosperity, and if this prosperity  turns\r\n\r\nto  misery and hardship, then it is not because of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. State Government, but because  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government! How clever of the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nwash  its  hands of all blame! Any person  with  a\r\n\r\nlittle    study    can   see   through    P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nmachinations, which aim at absolving  itself  from\r\n\r\nblame and passing the buck to the Federation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is typical of P.A.P. politics, always\r\n\r\nclaiming   credits  for  itself  when  there   are\r\n\r\ncredits, and always passing the blame on to others\r\n\r\nwhere there is blame! Hitherto all P.A.P. failures\r\n\r\nhave  been blamed on the Communist bogey. And  for\r\n\r\nquite  some  time to come, the P.A.P. will  still\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  blame the Communist  bogey  for  all\r\n\r\nP.A.P. failures.  But from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  it  can be seen  that  there  is\r\n\r\nalready a shift in P.A.P. strategy. It is to  pass\r\n\r\nthe  buck  on  to the Central Government  for  all\r\n\r\nP.A.P. failures in future, whenever the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey  scapegoat cannot be very suitable. Thus  if\r\n\r\nall  the  miseries and hardships  that  come  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia and confrontation cannot be laid  at  the\r\n\r\ndoor  of  the Communist bogey and the Indonesians,\r\n\r\nthen  they  will  be  laid  at  the  door  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government! Clever P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. makes a list of its so-called\r\n\r\npast  achievements. Expansion and  development  of\r\n\r\nthe city that comes with natural growth, as it has\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  100 years of  British  colonial\r\n\r\nrule,  is put up as P.A.P. achievements to beguile\r\n\r\nthe people, saying in fact that but for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthere  would  not  have been  such  expansion  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the national income over the years is\r\n\r\nsimilarly used by the P.A.P. as an index of P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsuccess when, in fact, the rate of increase  could\r\n\r\nwell have been greater if there had been political\r\n\r\nstability in Singapore without the P.A.P.! Now the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. wants the people to believe that  if  this\r\n\r\nrising  national income should decline as a result\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmultiplyer  effects of Malaysia and  confrontation\r\n\r\n(as it undoubtedly will decline) then the blame is\r\n\r\nnot the P.A.P.'s but the Central Government's!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unexpectedly while the P.A.P. tries to give a\r\n\r\npicture of growth and prosperity to sidetrack  the\r\n\r\npeople's  attention from loss of  trade,  business\r\n\r\nand  employment,  it has completely  forgotten  to\r\n\r\nmention the supposed avowed objectives of the  old\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  - namely, the fight for a  more  equal  and\r\n\r\njust  society. The P.A.P. does not deny  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  poverty, social  injustices  and\r\n\r\ninequality  all over Singapore. The vast  majority\r\n\r\nof  the people in Singapore are very poor. Tens of\r\n\r\nthousands are out of job. Thirty to forty thousand\r\n\r\nyoung men and women leave school to look for  work\r\n\r\nevery year. What does the P.A.P. propose to do  to\r\n\r\nhelp these unfortunate people? What plans has  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to get rid of poverty, social injustice and\r\n\r\ninequality? On all these most important  subjects,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. is singularly silent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. states that \"the main objectives of\r\n\r\neconomic  and social policies were all mapped  out\r\n\r\nfour  and a half years ago\" when the P.A.P. first\r\n\r\ntook  office  in  1959. At that  time  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproclaimed to the whole world its declared  policy\r\n\r\nto fight for a more equal and just society, for  a\r\n\r\nsocialist society. If the objectives of today  are\r\n\r\nthe same as those mapped out in 1959, then what is\r\n\r\nthe  programme  of  the P.A.P. Government  towards\r\n\r\nthese  objectives? There are words and words about\r\n\r\ngrowth   and   prosperity  for  foreign   monopoly\r\n\r\ncapitalists. But where is the prosperity for those\r\n\r\nwho  are  abjectly  poor in the  midst  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nplenty? What programme is mapped out for the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  oppressed and exploited  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so  that they may get  rid  of  social\r\n\r\ninjustices,  social  inequality,  oppression   and\r\n\r\nexploitation? So that they may really enjoy a fair\r\n\r\nshare of the fruits of their labour? So that  they\r\n\r\nmay enjoy their basic rights and freedoms? So that\r\n\r\nall   may  enjoy  a  socialist  society  with   no\r\n\r\nexploitation of man by man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On all this, there is not a single word! It is\r\n\r\nquite  obvious  that  a socialist  society  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger the aim of the P.A.P. Its main task is  now\r\n\r\nto  look after the interests of the P.A.P. itself\r\n\r\nand  the  vested interests of a small  section  of\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore,  the Federation  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportant, in Britain, Australia, New Zealand  and\r\n\r\nthe   United  States.  For  these  Western  vested\r\n\r\ninterests, Malaysia is the best hope in South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.  After all, Malaysia is formed to allow  the\r\n\r\nWestern powers to maintain neo-colonialism in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, the P.A.P. still continues its\r\n\r\nlying propaganda about Malaysia. But it is already\r\n\r\nbecoming  increasingly clear to all  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat   Malaysia  gives  us  unequal   citizenship,\r\n\r\nrestricts  our freedom of movement  and  does  not\r\n\r\ngive  us  national  unity. In fact,  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\narrangements for Singapore are intended to  divide\r\n\r\nthe people and not to unite them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither has Malaysia given us independence.\r\n\r\nControl  over  Singapore is now  merely  exercised\r\n\r\nthrough  Kuala  Lumpur  instead  of  direct   from\r\n\r\nLondon.  There  is no doubt whatsoever  where  the\r\n\r\nultimate  control  lies.  No  amount  of   window-dressing  will  cover  up the  fact  that  British\r\n\r\nimperialism  still exercises subtle  control  over\r\n\r\nour country in the form of neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan have always fought against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and  imperialism,  and   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nattempts  to  deceive  the  people  about   having\r\n\r\nachieved  independence (by reading a  proclamation\r\n\r\non  31st August) will not be able to prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom   continuing  the  anti-colonial  and   anti-imperialist struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan have consistently fought for\r\n\r\nthe  basic rights and interests of the people.  We\r\n\r\nfight   for  the  oppressed  and  exploited,   the\r\n\r\nunderprivileged and downtrodden. We fight for  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   farmers,  fishermen,   hawkers,   taxi-drivers,  intellectuals, national businessmen.  We\r\n\r\nshall  do  our best to safeguard their  interests,\r\n\r\nand  we  shall  continue to struggle for  justice,\r\n\r\nequality,  democracy, peace and  freedom  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. always uses the Communist bogey to\r\n\r\nfrighten  and  intimidate the people.  And  indeed\r\n\r\nbecause  of  its  control of the State  propaganda\r\n\r\napparatus,  it has to a certain extent  succeeded.\r\n\r\nBut  however  the P.A.P. may care to play  on  the\r\n\r\ntheme  of  the Communist bogey, with the  hope  of\r\n\r\nisolating  the  Barisan and  gaining  support  for\r\n\r\nitself,  it cannot cover up the fact that \"poverty\r\n\r\nin  the  midst of plenty and unemployment  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of affluence\" are urgent problems which have\r\n\r\nto  be faced, tackled and resolved. Labelling  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  pro-Communist simply because we  want  to\r\n\r\nhelp  solve  these basic problems, cannot  deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people  for any length of time.  P.A.P. lies\r\n\r\nmight deceive some of the people all the time, and\r\n\r\nall  the people some of the time. But they  cannot\r\n\r\ndeceive  all the people all the time. P.A.P. lies\r\n\r\nwill all be exposed. Truth will out and truth will\r\n\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to some of the other pro-colonial\r\n\r\npolicies of the P.A.P. I will leave the subject of\r\n\r\nconfrontation  and its effects on the  economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to be debated later when we come to  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Budget statement on Wednesday.  But\r\n\r\nbefore I go further, let me first remind the House\r\n\r\nthat the financial arrangements under the Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement  have  literally robbed Singapore  of  a\r\n\r\nhuge  chunk  of its revenue. We pay the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment $117 million outright. In addition,  we\r\n\r\npay  for  developments of Federal  departments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  ($9.5 million) as well as the  annually\r\n\r\nrecurrent    expenditure    of    Statecum-Federal\r\n\r\ndepartments ($15 million approximately).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we add the $30 million so-called loan to the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories, then the sum  given  away  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the Federation comes to  about  $170\r\n\r\nmillion! $170 million of our money given away!  If\r\n\r\nthis  money  were truly used for construction  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment, at least we would be consoled by  the\r\n\r\nfact that our money was put to good use. But it is\r\n\r\nclear that most of our money will not be spent  on\r\n\r\nconstruction and development, but on the expansion\r\n\r\nof  armed  forces and for the suppression  of  the\r\n\r\nnational liberation struggle in Borneo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the way how our money should be spent.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  on armed expansion will only  benefit\r\n\r\nthe  big arms industries in the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nthe U.S.A. Our Party had repeatedly warned against\r\n\r\nthis  during the debate on the Malaysia Agreement!\r\n\r\nNow  all  can  see that what the Barisan  has  all\r\n\r\nalong  said  is 100 per cent correct.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmust  be condemned for having signed away all this\r\n\r\nmoney of the people of Singapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the other pro-colonial policies of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our multi-national State, it is important that\r\n\r\ngenuine  equal  treatment is  given  to  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education.  Unfortunately  the   past\r\n\r\nrecord of the P.A.P. has shown that it merely pays\r\n\r\nlip  service  to its so-called equal treatment  of\r\n\r\nthe four streams of education. In actual fact, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. lays all emphasis on English education  and\r\n\r\nneglects the rest. Clear evidence of this  can  be\r\n\r\nseen  in  the disproportionately large  number  of\r\n\r\nEnglish schools built as against schools for other\r\n\r\nlanguage  streams;  and in  the  large  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  in English, as against Malay and  Indian\r\n\r\nand Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is foolish of Government to try to put the\r\n\r\nblame  for the great disparity between the  number\r\n\r\nof  students  joining  English  schools  and  that\r\n\r\njoining Chinese schools, on the parents themselves\r\n\r\nand  on  so-called agitation and unrest in Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This naive P.A.P. explanation will not hide the\r\n\r\nevident  P.A.P. discrimination against the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.   Neither  does  the  sacking   of   the\r\n\r\ninefficient  ex-Minister absolve the P.A.P. as  a\r\n\r\nwhole  from blame. Nor the report that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   now   suddenly  believes   in   primary\r\n\r\neducation first in the mother tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the P.A.P. Government has discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  Nanyang University is of course  a  well-known  fact. $8.5 million annual aid is  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  University of Singapore but not a single cent\r\n\r\nof  aid  has so far been given to Nantah.  Neither\r\n\r\nhave  Nantah  degrees  been  recognised  nor   the\r\n\r\ngraduates  been  given  the  same  pay   and   job\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of P.A.P. slogan-shouting can deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. The fact  remains  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no equal treatment for the four  streams\r\n\r\nof   education.  It  is  clear  that  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\neducation policy is to ultimately \"anglicise\"  all\r\n\r\nlanguage   streams,  under  cover   of   so-called\r\n\r\n\"integration\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the national language, we hope that\r\n\r\nthe  proposed intensification of the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nthe Malay language this time will not turn out  to\r\n\r\nbe yet another P.A.P. stunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worrying many people at the present\r\n\r\nmoment is the question of university autonomy  and\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom. The open and unashamed pressure\r\n\r\nput  on  the  University of Singapore  Council  to\r\n\r\ncompel the resignation of Dr Sreenivasan, ex-Vice-Chancellor  of  the University of  Singapore,  has\r\n\r\nopened the eyes of many people in Malaya. All  can\r\n\r\nnow see P.A.P. machinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the name of security of the State and anti-Communism, all sorts of repressive measures have\r\n\r\nalready been taken against political opponents and\r\n\r\n\"unfriendly\"  organisations.  The  same  untenable\r\n\r\nexcuses  are  now  used  by  the  P.A.P. to  gain\r\n\r\nabsolute  control  over the  two  universities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  P.A.P. is bent on  a  rampage  of\r\n\r\nwitch-hunt and Macarthyism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not without reason that the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore  students  went  on  a  one-day  protest\r\n\r\nboycott of classes. We ask the Government to pause\r\n\r\nand  ponder.  We  ask the P.A.P. not  to  further\r\n\r\r\nviolate  the democratic rights of the people.  The\r\n\r\nseats  of learning in Singapore should be  granted\r\n\r\ntheir  university  autonomy and academic  freedom,\r\n\r\nand  the  Government should take steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthis respect for autonomy and academic freedom  in\r\n\r\nthe universities of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. victimisation and witch-hunt has also\r\n\r\nextended  into  all  other education  departments.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  that  is the reason why a Special  Branch\r\n\r\nOfficer  has  been  transferred to  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry. Some teachers have already been informed\r\n\r\nthat their services will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsoon  be  terminated. We warn the Government  that\r\n\r\nsuch  victimisation and reign of  terror  must  be\r\n\r\nstopped.  P.A.P. politics should not be introduced\r\n\r\ninto schools under the guise of anti-Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. still shouts autonomy in education.\r\n\r\nHave  not  all the recent events proved that  what\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan has been saying all along is  correct\r\n\r\n- that education autonomy is now totally bankrupt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the Government has handled\r\n\r\nthe  cholera  epidemic is deplorable.  Choked  and\r\n\r\nunswept drains have caused a great increase in the\r\n\r\npopulation of flies and mosquitoes. Diseases  like\r\n\r\nmalaria,  long unheard of in Singapore,  are  once\r\n\r\nagain  making  their reappearance. The  danger  to\r\n\r\nhealth  must  have been obvious to  all.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  been so busy with its  anti-Communism\r\n\r\ncrusade that it does not see, or does not want  to\r\n\r\nsee, such dangers to the health of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nresult  is that a one-time clean Singapore is  now\r\n\r\nturned into a cholera infected port. The number of\r\n\r\ncholera  cases  so far confirmed is  23  with  two\r\n\r\ndeaths.   But  the  number  of  cases   that   are\r\n\r\nundiagnosed  or unconfirmed must be  much  higher.\r\n\r\nDaily reports of new cases are still coming in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why has the public health\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore been so neglected to such a\r\n\r\nserious extent? Why were there no proper, adequate\r\n\r\nand  timely precautions and preparations  made  by\r\n\r\nthe Government to inform the people of the serious\r\n\r\ndanger of cholera and so protect them against this\r\n\r\ndisease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot be said that the disease was isolated\r\n\r\nand  well  under  control.  No!  The  disease  was\r\n\r\nrapidly spreading and cholera cases were found  in\r\n\r\nwidely  separated districts all over  the  island.\r\n\r\nThe  danger of a quick spread of the disease  must\r\n\r\nhave been well understood. Yet no action was taken\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P. Government to quickly isolate, limit\r\n\r\nand control the disease. No advice was given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  people to get inoculations as quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible. And the Government made no provisions to\r\n\r\nstart  mass inoculations for the people until  the\r\n\r\ndangerous infection had spread far and wide.  With\r\n\r\nsuch  a dangerous infectious disease like cholera,\r\n\r\nthe confirmed diagnosis of two cases is sufficient\r\n\r\nto   warrant   the  description  of  the   disease\r\n\r\nsituation  as  epidemic. Yet the people  were  not\r\n\r\ninformed of the seriousness of the situation until\r\n\r\nthere were 10 confirmed cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this P.A.P. \"don't-care-less\" attitude?\r\n\r\nBefore  the general elections when only one single\r\n\r\ncase of cholera appeared in Potong Pasir following\r\n\r\nthe  epidemic  in Malacca, the Government  quickly\r\n\r\ngot  down  to  the  job of mass  inoculations.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  was meant to show how  efficient  a\r\n\r\ngovernment the P.A.P. was. The P.A.P. had hoped to\r\n\r\nbuy  votes.  This  time, after the  elections  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  acted with  indifference  to  the\r\n\r\npublic health situation of Singapore. Almost as if\r\n\r\nit  does  not  matter! Why such indifference  this\r\n\r\ntime? Is it not because the elections are over and\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has already formed the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. must be condemned for its criminal\r\n\r\nnegligence   in  the  handling  of   the   cholera\r\n\r\nepidemic. If earlier and more energetic action had\r\n\r\nbeen taken by the Government, there might not have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  many cholera cases today,  and  the  two\r\n\r\ndeaths might have been prevented. For the Minister\r\n\r\nto  go  round  the  clinics watching  inoculations\r\n\r\nafter the damage has been done will not redeem the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in  the eyes of the people for  its  gross\r\n\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always boasted of its flats and\r\n\r\nhousing and P.A.P. Ministers have received  medals\r\n\r\nand  praise  from  the P.A.P. Government  for  so-called P.A.P. achievements. It is a matter of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. praising the P.A.P. What are the facts? Out\r\n\r\nof  the thousands of housing units built, how many\r\n\r\nof  them are low-cost housing units that the  poor\r\n\r\npeople can afford? It is a fact that thousands  of\r\n\r\nflats have been built by the Housing Board. But it\r\n\r\nis also a fact that thousands have remained vacant\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunoccupied  for  months and months,  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nspecial inducements to would-be tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has been provided with funds by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to build low-cost housing for  the\r\n\r\npoor, not to build expensive and high-cost housing\r\n\r\nthat  the  poor cannot afford to rent. We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to see building for the sake of building. Any\r\n\r\nperson provided with the funds could build housing\r\n\r\nflats.  Neither  do we want to see  housing  flats\r\n\r\nbuilt with the people's money to be used as police\r\n\r\nbarracks  and military barracks, as has been  done\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P. Let the P.A.P. really build low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  units  in  future so that  the  poor  can\r\n\r\nreally  afford to stay in them, or at least  lower\r\n\r\nthe  present  high  rentals in the  housing  flats\r\n\r\nalready built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. plans to sell what it describes as low-cost housing flats. It sounds attractive. But the\r\n\r\npoor who already live from hand to mouth will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  afford to buy any of  these  housing\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water rationing is fast becoming a feature of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. misrule.  The great inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\npeople might still be somewhat excused because the\r\n\r\nprolonged  drought at one time was not within  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  human  endeavour. But  today's  water\r\n\r\nshortage  has come about largely as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. incompetence.  The P.A.P. must  be  fully\r\n\r\nresponsible  for its failure to pursue  vigorously\r\n\r\nthe  Johore  River project in the last few  years.\r\n\r\nAnd  now  as  a result of P.A.P. incompetence  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  not only  suffer  from  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  of water rationing, but  also  from\r\n\r\nthe grave dangers of a cholera epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the P.A.P. pursue the Johore River project\r\n\r\nwith the utmost despatch. Singapore has the funds.\r\n\r\nLet  the  P.A.P. use the millions we have  in  the\r\n\r\nkitty.  There is no necessity to borrow  from  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank. The P.A.P. has already mortgaged  all\r\n\r\nthe   property  of  the  Public  Utilities   Board\r\n\r\n- property belonging to the people of Singapore - to\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank  on most humiliating  terms.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should  not  repeat the  same  humiliating\r\n\r\nmistake. If we can afford to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  loans  to  the Borneo territories,  free  of\r\n\r\ninterest,   then  we  certainly  can   afford   to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  Johore River project  on  our  own\r\n\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.'s plan to expand the network of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres as well as the Work Brigade  is\r\n\r\nof  course dictated by P.A.P. tactics and strategy\r\n\r\nto  protect P.A.P. interests. We all know how  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres were used to spread P.A.P. lies\r\n\r\nduring the unfair snap general elections. And many\r\n\r\nhave  seen  the manner in which the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nboys were used by the P.A.P. to tear down election\r\n\r\nposters  of  the  Barisan and  to  intimidate  and\r\n\r\nassault  Barisan  election workers.  Many  Barisan\r\n\r\nworkers  still  bear the marks of  brutal  assault\r\n\r\nfrom  these  P.A.P. strong-arm boys. Doubling  and\r\n\r\ntrebling the present strength of 2,000 in the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade will only mean more strong-arm squads  for\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. at State expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must warn against such Fascist machinations of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. The Work Brigade should be used to help\r\n\r\nin  national  Construction, and  not  to  build  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. still unashamedly proclaims its policy\r\n\r\nof  so-called  industrial peace with justice.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  in Singapore have already seen  how  this\r\n\r\nP.A.P. policy  is  put into  practice.  It  means\r\n\r\ncomplete suppression of the workers' basic  rights\r\n\r\nand freedom. The freezing of funds of the workers,\r\n\r\nthe banning of their unions, the breaking of their\r\n\r\nlawful  strikes,  the arbitrary  arrest  of  their\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders - this  is  what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nlabour policy means to the workers. All those  who\r\n\r\ndo not support the P.A.P. and all those who refuse\r\n\r\nto  come  under its control are labelled Communist\r\n\r\nand  pro-Communist. Threats and  intimidation  are\r\n\r\nused,   in   addition  to  subtle  deception   and\r\n\r\npromises, to coerce workers into accepting control\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P. The Government breaking  of  the\r\n\r\nNaval Base strike alone shows how pro-employer and\r\n\r\npro-imperialist   the  P.A.P. is.   The   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment uses the power of the State  to  impose\r\n\r\nits so-called industrial peace on the workers with\r\n\r\njustice for the employers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  its  imperial  masters, with  oppression  and\r\n\r\ninjustice for the workers. That is the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. slogan, and more and more workers  are\r\n\r\ndaily awakening to this P.A.P. deception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say to the P.A.P.: if the slogan of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with justice is to be meaningful, then  let\r\n\r\nthere be justice to the workers. In which case the\r\n\r\nGovernment must immediately stop playing politics,\r\n\r\nstop  unlawful  and splitting activities  of  pro-P.A.P. yellow unions, and restore and respect  the\r\n\r\nbasic  right and freedom of workers to form unions\r\n\r\nof  their own choice. Only then can there be  true\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have touched but briefly on a few of the sins\r\n\r\nof  P.A.P. commissions and omissions. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhad boasted of its Four-Year Plan, but many of its\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans have been completely  forgotten.\r\n\r\nFor   example,  the  Singapore  River  improvement\r\n\r\nproject  and  developments in the hospitals,  etc.\r\n\r\nare  now set aside. Only a small fraction  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds   provided   has   been   spent   on   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and so on. The large surpluses  year\r\n\r\nafter  year of P.A.P. office have come about  very\r\n\r\nlargely  as  a  result of P.A.P. inefficiency  and\r\n\r\nunder-expenditure  on  development  projects   all\r\n\r\nround.  No  amount  of P.A.P. propaganda  to  the\r\n\r\ncontrary will be able to hide these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. is still shouting out its\r\n\r\nsuccesses.  Meanwhile  the  unemployment  problem,\r\n\r\nalready acute as it is, is fast becoming more  and\r\n\r\nmore  acute  with each passing day. How  does  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. intend to resolve this grave crisis in  the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For selfish reasons the P.A.P. has helped to\r\n\r\nimpose  Malaysia on the people, bringing  with  it\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation and great hardships  for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore and South-East Asia.  The\r\n\r\nnewspapers headline Indonesia as \"Hungerland\". But\r\n\r\non the Malaysia side, Singapore bears the brunt of\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation. Out of a loss of  $1,325\r\n\r\nmillion worth of trade for the whole of Malaya  in\r\n\r\n1962,  Singapore's share of the loss  amounted  to\r\n\r\n$1,100 million, i.e. more than 80 per cent of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  total loss. Singapore therefore has a special\r\n\r\nvested   interest  in  the  ending  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation. The living of the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore depends on it. Hence  the\r\n\r\nneed and urgency of our amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that the amendment is in the\r\n\r\nfield  of  foreign  affairs  which  is  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Central Government and  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government has no jurisdiction over such\r\n\r\nmatters. The speech of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nstates  that [col. 117 of Hansard, 29th  November,\r\n\r\n19631:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is policy settled by a Government which\r\n\r\ncommands  a majority of the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nin Kuala Lumpur that will decide our fate...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  may also be argued that Singapore has only  15\r\n\r\nMembers in a Parliament of 159, and that therefore\r\n\r\nthe   influence  of  these  15  M.P.s  is  totally\r\n\r\ninadequate for changing the policy of the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is true. We had pointed out all this\r\n\r\nlong ago during the merger debate, and this is one\r\n\r\nof  the  reasons why we opposed the P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\narrangements, which have already put the  neck  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  the noose held by the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. We must not forget this. We  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  also  that  it  was the  P.A.P. that  had\r\n\r\nactively  promoted the formation of Malaysia.  And\r\n\r\nit  was the P.A.P. that had insisted, in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  glaring injustice and inequality  of  second-class      citizenship     and     disproportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation,  that its merger terms  were  fair\r\n\r\nand  reasonable. Morever, for the past  two  years\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has shouted that Malaysia will  bring\r\n\r\nstability, peace and prosperity to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons the P.A.P. must bear its\r\n\r\nfull  share  of  responsibility for  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  in Singapore today. The P.A.P. itself  has\r\n\r\nbrought about the present sufferings and hardships\r\n\r\nfor  the  people.  It is now the P.A.P.'s  bounden\r\n\r\nduty  to  help remove the root cause of  all  such\r\n\r\nsufferings and hardships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be argued that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nM.P.s  themselves  could  move  a  motion  to   so\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Central Government  to  change  its\r\n\r\npolicy and start negotiating with the Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to resolve all existing differences  to\r\n\r\nour   mutual  benefit  and  so  bring  peace   and\r\n\r\nprosperity to South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we tell the P.A.P.: it is the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nresponsibility to rectify its own mistakes and  it\r\n\r\nmight yet redeem itself in the eyes of the people.\r\n\r\nIn  normal  times it would already have  been  the\r\n\r\nduty   and   responsibility   of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to approach the Central Government  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of State and national interest on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore. These are not normal\r\n\r\ntimes.  Now the vital interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are at stake. Therefore, it becomes  the\r\n\r\ndouble  duty  and responsibility of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  raise  matters  with  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  either  on a Government-to-Government\r\n\r\nlevel,   or   even   as  part  of   the   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  Singapore  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confrontation is a serious affair. It has\r\n\r\naffected not just 8.7 per cent of our economy, and\r\n\r\nnot just 8,200 people as the P.A.P. would like  us\r\n\r\nto  believe. The trade loss is at least 16-20  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the total trade of Singapore. The  number\r\n\r\nof  people who have lost their jobs and livelihood\r\n\r\ndirectly  as  a  result of confrontation  must  be\r\n\r\nbetween  20,000 and 30,000. The number  of  people\r\n\r\nindirectly  affected as a result of the multiplyer\r\n\r\neffects must certainly include almost every person\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember too that it is Malaysia that\r\n\r\nhas  given rise to Indonesian confrontation. There\r\n\r\nis  already sufficient international tension as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of rupture of diplomatic relations between\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines and Indonesia on the one side and\r\n\r\nMalaysia on the other. Jingoism and the burning of\r\n\r\neffigies  of leaders of neighbouring countries  in\r\n\r\norder to arouse the so-called patriotic sentiments\r\n\r\nof  the  people, will only further  increase  this\r\n\r\ninternational   tension.   If   we   openly   make\r\n\r\npreparations   for   war,   first   by   man-power\r\n\r\nregistration   and   later  by  mobilisation   and\r\n\r\nconscription,  it will only further aggravate  the\r\n\r\nsituation.   It  might  even  lead  to   explosive\r\n\r\nincidents  which may well precipitate our  country\r\n\r\ninto  a  hot  war. This is a thing which  we  must\r\n\r\navoid under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remain ever vigilant against foreign\r\n\r\nimperialist  machinations that try to involve  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the region into fighting against  each\r\n\r\nother. The neo-colonialists and imperialists  want\r\n\r\nto  divide our unity and oar strength so that they\r\n\r\nmay  continue their policy of divide and rule.  If\r\n\r\nthe  people go to war, they would merely fall into\r\n\r\nthe  imperialist trap. Moreover, the  people  will\r\n\r\nnot benefit from war, as what follows can only  be\r\n\r\nsufferings and hardships for all. Those  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  are the foreign arms industries  and  the\r\n\r\nimperialists who want to oppress and  exploit  us.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not war but peace that the people want  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia. And it is peace that we must help\r\n\r\nto safeguard and defend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Macapagal is reported to have said in\r\n\r\nNew  York  on  6th December, 1963, that  \"For  the\r\n\r\npresent,  while Indonesia is willing to meet  anew\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia  and the Philippines,  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nreluctant  to do so\". Such reluctance to negotiate\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  due to the unwanted  influence  and\r\n\r\ninterference of foreigners and colonialists in the\r\n\r\naffairs of state in the Federation Government.  We\r\n\r\nmust get rid of this foreign interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously even Mr Arthur Bottomley, an admirer\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P., also accepts the principle that it\r\n\r\nis  a  good  thing  to  get  the  three  countries\r\n\r\ntogether in order \"to call a halt to the trouble\".\r\n\r\nThis  was  reported in the Straits  Times  of  7th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must do our best to persuade the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to  go  to  the  conference\r\n\r\ntable  and  negotiate  with  the  Philippines  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of the people demand that we\r\n\r\nprevent   the  present  friction  from  developing\r\n\r\nfurther into open conflict and war with Indonesia.\r\n\r\nOnly peace will bring happiness and prosperity  to\r\n\r\nthe people. So let all of us in Singapore make our\r\n\r\nfull  contribution to the defence of peace in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are elected representatives of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nour primary duties and responsibilities are to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.

They\r\n\r\nthemselves   have   caused   this   situation   of\r\n\r\nconfrontation between Malaysia and Indonesia.  Now\r\n\r\nthey  want  to shift the blame on to the shoulders\r\n\r\nof others. They are blaming others as the culprits\r\n\r\nin order to clear their own names. Their action is\r\n\r\nreally very wonderful and fantastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should review what has taken place in the past\r\n\r\nfew  years.  It  is now the time for stock-taking.\r\n\r\nLet us now review our achievements in the past few\r\n\r\nyears  we  have  been in office.  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nparadise   in   South-East   Asia.   Our   people,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of race and class,  are  enjoying  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood and standard of living much better than\r\n\r\nthat of any other country in South-East Asia.  Had\r\n\r\nit  not been for the agitation and instigation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  which  has  brought  about\r\n\r\nconfrontation against Malaysia, our  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore    especially   would   have    achieved\r\n\r\nunprecedented   prosperity  and   happiness.   But\r\n\r\nbecause of the stupidity and stubbornness  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis in persisting in their  line  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation, we have now amongst us thousands of\r\n\r\npoor  labourers who have to pay the price  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan misdeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask, which country in South-East Asia is\r\n\r\nenjoying the same high standard of living which we\r\n\r\nare  enjoying? Which country in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  has  been  enjoying the  same  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving, or whose people are better clothed, better\r\n\r\nfed  and  have better enjoyment? Just look  around\r\n\r\nthose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries, such as Indonesia. The people there are\r\n\r\nin  deep  water  and  in great difficulties.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  enjoy what we are now enjoying. They  have\r\n\r\neven  difficulty in filling their  stomachs.  They\r\n\r\nare  now even eating roots, the bark of trees  and\r\n\r\nfruits to fill their stomachs. Perhaps they  could\r\n\r\nexplain  their  way  and say,  as  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nleaders  have said, that the spirit of  revolution\r\n\r\ncan  resolve all this, and that the people  should\r\n\r\nput  the  revolutionary spirit  first  before  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of their hunger. But in asking  their\r\n\r\npeople  to  tighten their belts,  these  so-called\r\n\r\nleaders are driving their people to starvation. It\r\n\r\nis  fortunate  that we have no such leadership  in\r\n\r\nour  State.  Otherwise we would be  suffering  the\r\n\r\nsame kind of misfortune as they are now suffering.\r\n\r\nIn  which country are the people enjoying the same\r\n\r\nstandard  of living as we are enjoying  here?  Our\r\n\r\ncurrency is the strongest and most stable in South-East  Asia.  For  example, if the  $500  allowance\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Barisan Members is put into a  bank.\r\n\r\nthey  can still buy $500 worth of goods when  they\r\n\r\ndraw it out next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see the situation in Indonesia today. It\r\n\r\nis unimaginable. Even the Japanese banana notes or\r\n\r\ncoconut  notes are worth more than the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncurrency   nowadays.   If  a  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nlecturer  in  Mathematics were  to  calculate  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian currency, he would have to calculate it\r\n\r\nin  five or six digits, as the Indonesian children\r\n\r\nare  learning in their schools. Under such tuition\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Barisan Members  could  have  better\r\n\r\nenlightenment. For instance, in 1960 Mr Chan  Sun\r\n\r\nWing followed the Prime Minister to Indonesia on a\r\n\r\nfriendly  visit, and he carried two bags  full  of\r\n\r\nIndonesian currency in order to buy goods. He  was\r\n\r\nlooking for goods everywhere, and he had to  carry\r\n\r\nsuch  a bundle of Indonesian notes with him.  This\r\n\r\nis  the  situation with regard to  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncurrency  and  economy. Inflation is  rampant  and\r\n\r\nthere are economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore we have schools. We have a\r\n\r\nplace  in  school  for every  child,  to  whatever\r\n\r\nschool the child wants to go, whether it is Tamil,\r\n\r\nMalay or English. The children of Singapore can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  to any school in any part of Singapore, in the\r\n\r\nSouth Bridge Road area or in the North Bridge Road\r\n\r\narea  or  in Queenstown. Here we have free primary\r\n\r\neducation. Students who are poor but diligent  can\r\n\r\nget  bursaries  and scholarships. I  believe  that\r\n\r\namong  the  Nanyang  University  friends  of   the\r\n\r\nBarisan   there   are  many  students   who   have\r\n\r\nGovernment scholarships and bursaries  to  go  for\r\n\r\nhigher  studies. They can make use  of  Government\r\n\r\nscholarships   to   continue  their   studies   in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  and the universities.  Let  me\r\n\r\nask,  in which country in South-East Asia are such\r\n\r\nfacilities afforded to the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here among us we also have cheap housing. The\r\n\r\nGovernment is giving subsidies for the  people  to\r\n\r\nhave their accommodation. The people can choose to\r\n\r\nlive  in  the North Bridge Road area or the  South\r\n\r\nBridge  Road  area or anywhere in Singapore.  They\r\n\r\ncan  also  choose  to have one-room,  two-room  or\r\n\r\nthree-room flats. They have this right to  make  a\r\n\r\nchoice.  It is not any country in South-East  Asia\r\n\r\nwhich  has  this kind of facilities, even  in  the\r\n\r\nwhole world there are very few countries which can\r\n\r\nafford  these  facilities to the  people.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople  fall sick, there are doctors to  prescribe\r\n\r\nfor them and they do not have to pay a single cent\r\n\r\nfor  this  service.  The Government  is  providing\r\n\r\nclinics which are right at your doorstep and  poor\r\n\r\nchildren can get a free milk supply. Let  me  ask,\r\n\r\nhow  many countries in the whole world can  afford\r\n\r\nthese  medical services and other free  facilities\r\n\r\nto the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are enjoying a standard of wages and\r\n\r\nliving  far  better  than anywhere  in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech it is also\r\n\r\ndisclosed  that the number of vehicles  registered\r\n\r\nthis  year has increased by 45 per cent more  than\r\n\r\nthat of last year. Now, this figure can very aptly\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  show  the  raising  of  the  living\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the  workers.  We  have  progressive\r\n\r\nlabour legislation which will protect the workers'\r\n\r\ninterests, and the Industrial Relations  ordinance\r\n\r\nprovides   for  good  relationships  between   the\r\n\r\nemployer and the employee. Very few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries   in  South-East  Asia  can  have   such\r\n\r\nenlightened  legislation for the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people, irrespective of their situation, can\r\n\r\nget  aid  from the Government. Every year  we  are\r\n\r\nspending millions of dollars on public assistance,\r\n\r\nsuch as fire relief funds, unemployment assistance\r\n\r\nand  other  schemes of aid. Ours  is  a  socialist\r\n\r\nwelfare  state policy. The rich are sharing  their\r\n\r\nwealth  with the poor, and this is only  just  and\r\n\r\nreasonable.  Our society is marching towards  this\r\n\r\ntype of socialist society. Who can say that we  do\r\n\r\nnot     have    socialist    legislation?    These\r\n\r\nopportunities of employment and the  provision  of\r\n\r\nthe facilities I have stated above are for all the\r\n\r\npeople  to enjoy irrespective of whether they  are\r\n\r\nagainst  or  for the P.A.P. - even among Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan who are enjoying our low-cost housing\r\n\r\nfacilities.  We  are  so  used  to  seeing   these\r\n\r\nfavourable  conditions  and  facilities  that   we\r\n\r\nsometimes   forget  about  the  value   of   these\r\n\r\nfacilities.  It  is  just as what  we  say,  being\r\n\r\namongst the flowers for so long, one forgets their\r\n\r\nfragrance. In fact, we tend to think that  we  get\r\n\r\nthese  things  as our natural right, which  other\r\n\r\ncountries can never dream to have. We should thank\r\n\r\nour  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for his speech  which\r\n\r\naffords us an opportunity to remind all our people\r\n\r\nthat we are living in a very healthy and fortunate\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the establishment of Malaysia as the New\r\n\r\nYork  of  Malaysia,  we can  expect  that  we  can\r\n\r\nfurther  raise  the  standard  of  living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople. We have all the factors and conditions  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  this.  We have further reason  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  even bring about  more  wealth  and\r\n\r\nenjoyment to the people. We have a very  good  and\r\n\r\nefficient  administration,  communication,  fiscal\r\n\r\nand  trade systems. After Malaysia, our goods will\r\n\r\r\nhave a larger market and will also be protected by\r\n\r\ntariff   legislation.  We  will  also  have   rich\r\n\r\nmaterial  resources. All this will bring  about  a\r\n\r\nbetter  future for us. These are the main  factors\r\n\r\nthat will bring this about. We are now on the road\r\n\r\nto prosperity, happiness and a better future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are now facing Indonesian confrontation\r\n\r\nwhich has caused thousands of people to be out  of\r\n\r\njob  and a depression in our trade. Who has caused\r\n\r\nall this? Who has disturbed the beautiful dream of\r\n\r\nour  people? To go to the root of the  matter,  we\r\n\r\ncan say that the confrontation policy by Indonesia\r\n\r\ntoday is caused by the Barisan Sosialis. They  are\r\n\r\nthe culprits. The Barisan Members should know that\r\n\r\nthe unemployment of thousands of our workers today\r\n\r\nand  the depression in our trade are, to a certain\r\n\r\nextent, caused by them. They should be responsible\r\n\r\nfor all these consequences because they have tried\r\n\r\ntheir  best  to oppose Malaysia and do all  things\r\n\r\npossible  to  destroy  our democratic  system  and\r\n\r\naffluent society. When we want to lay hands on any\r\n\r\nculprit,  we should lay it on the Barisan Members.\r\n\r\nIt  is  they who have caused us these difficulties\r\n\r\n- the unemployment of thousands of our workers  and\r\n\r\ndepression  in  our  trade.  They  are  the  arch-culprits who have caused this trouble arising from\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian confrontation policy. We  can  see\r\n\r\nvery  well that at the beginning of this  two-year\r\n\r\nstruggle  for Malaysia, Indonesia had not  opposed\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Even Dr Subandrio in December 1962 said\r\n\r\nin   New  York  that  Indonesia  was  not  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia, if it was the wish of the people. On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  Indonesia would  give  Malaysia  her\r\n\r\nblessing. At that time the Barisan's opposition to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  throughout Malaysia had not the  support\r\n\r\nof the people and the referendum held in September\r\n\r\nhad also dealt the Barisan a deadly crushing blow.\r\n\r\nLater they changed their strategy and secured  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the Indonesian leaders, especially  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I.,  to provide them with spiritual and  moral\r\n\r\nsupport  in  their  opposition  to  Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nP.K.I. passed  a resolution last year  condemning\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  At  that  time the  Barisan  were  very\r\n\r\nelated.  The resolution passed by the P.K.I. gave\r\n\r\nthem  a  stimulant  to continue  their  activities\r\n\r\nagainst  Malaysia.  They  took  heart  from   that\r\n\r\nresolution  and persisted in their  opposition  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Now we cannot deny that the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation against Malaysia has been instigated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  encouraged by the Barisan Sosialis. Even  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  themselves last year  admitted  this.  We\r\n\r\ncould use their own documents and publications  to\r\n\r\nprove  this  point. In the issue  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\norgan  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  of  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nDecember,  on the second page, there was published\r\n\r\nan  article the subject of which was \"The Cause of\r\n\r\nMalayan Socialist Front in the Present Situation\";\r\n\r\nof  course,  this includes the Singapore  Barisan.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the article says --- [Interruption].\r\n\r\nHow  can you say that I am talking at random? This\r\n\r\nis  from  your own article, published by your  own\r\n\r\nParty. It is from your own Party organ printed  in\r\n\r\nblack and white. How can you say that I am quoting\r\n\r\nat random? Now let me quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"First it must be pointed out that the Barisan\r\n\r\nwas  the  first who opposed the Malaysia  Plan  in\r\n\r\n1961.  At  that  time, Indonesia did  not  express\r\n\r\ntheir  opposition to the Malaysia Plan. The P.K.I.\r\n\r\nelements  and other people started to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan only after we had done so ---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interruption] Now, this is what you say in your\r\n\r\nown article. I am not arguing who is leading whom.\r\n\r\nPlease listen to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At that time, Indonesia did not express their\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the  Malaysia  Plan.  The   P.K.I.\r\n\r\nelements  and other people started to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia   Plan  only  after  we  had   done   so.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   if   there  was   anybody   following\r\n\r\nanybody's  line, then it must be they  who  follow\r\n\r\nour  line  and  not we who follow their  line.  We\r\n\r\nchallenge anybody to rebut this fact.\" --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interruption] This is what you yourselves have\r\n\r\nsaid,  or  your friends have said.  Now,  this  is\r\n\r\nmaking your own confession without being asked  to\r\n\r\ndo  so. Only this will go to prove that had it not\r\n\r\nbeen    for   the   Barisan's   instigation    and\r\n\r\nencouragement and trouble making, Indonesia  would\r\n\r\nnot have started a confrontation for no reason  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the article it is stated \"Malayan Socialist\r\n\r\nFront\"   but  we  know  that  Singapore's  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the Malayan Socialist Front are birds\r\n\r\nof the same feather. They themselves have admitted\r\n\r\nthat the Indonesian confrontation against Malaysia\r\n\r\nis following their line. Even the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nand the Socialist Front in Malaya have admitted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.  Now,  who  can  say  no?  The  reasons  for\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation  against  Malaysia   are\r\n\r\npartly   due   to   her   own  internal   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties. This can serve as a red  herring  to\r\n\r\ndivert  the  attention of the people  as  well  as\r\n\r\nforeign countries to her internal difficulties and\r\n\r\neconomic  disaster.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause the big shots in Indonesia have also taken\r\n\r\ncognisance   of   the  fact  that  the   Barisan's\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities in Singapore  will  provide\r\n\r\nthem  with  a  golden opportunity  to  divide  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  swallow up North Borneo  through  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  here.  But the people in  Indonesia  have\r\n\r\nforgotten  that  the people of  Malaysia  in  this\r\n\r\ncrisis  have  all  united together  to  deliver  a\r\n\r\ncrushing  blow to the Barisan. Indonesia wants  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of this opportunity to swallow  up  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories. This is her true intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the pretext that Malaysia is a threat to\r\n\r\nthe  security of Indonesia - it is all humbug.  The\r\n\r\nso-called military base, neo-colonialism, and  the\r\n\r\nrest,  are  all  pretexts used  by  these  people,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Barisan Sosialis. Yet  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nare  supporting them on this specious pretext. Can\r\n\r\nthey  not see that Malaysia, without any airplanes\r\n\r\nor warships, cannot be a threat to the security of\r\n\r\nIndonesia, a country which has so much armoury and\r\n\r\nsuch  a great army? We can see that when the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Agong visited Singapore, he came  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  small light out-moded military plane. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  even  have an air force but Indonesia  has  a\r\n\r\nlarge   fleet   of  jet  planes.  The   Indonesian\r\n\r\nPresident,  Dr Soekarno, has his own special  jet\r\n\r\nplane   to  fly  him  about.  And  Indonesia   has\r\n\r\nwarships, arms and submarines, supplied by  Russia\r\n\r\nas  well as America. But we do not have these.  So\r\n\r\nhow can we be a threat to others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military base in Malaysia has been in\r\n\r\nexistence  even  before the Indonesian  revolution\r\n\r\nand independence. Why did they then not object  to\r\n\r\nit?  Why should they wait till after Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nbeen  established to protest against the existence\r\n\r\nof this base?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their amendment the Barisan Sosialis urges the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to persuade the Central Government  to\r\n\r\nget rid of foreign interference and to ask for the\r\n\r\nabolition of the British military base. But if  we\r\n\r\nabolish  the base today, tomorrow it  will  be  an\r\n\r\nIndonesian  colony, and our livelihood and  living\r\n\r\nstandard  will  be  worse  than  that  under   the\r\n\r\nJapanese  regime, not to talk of the thousands  of\r\n\r\nNaval Base workers who will be out of job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can recollect that Indonesia first opposed\r\n\r\nMalaysia   after  December  1962  when   Azahari's\r\n\r\nrebellion in Brunei took place. During that period\r\n\r\nIndonesia had been encouraging a rebellion. Before\r\n\r\nthe  Brunei rebellion the rebel leader Azahari had\r\n\r\nflown  into  Singapore to have talks with  Barisan\r\n\r\nleaders,  including  Lim Ching  Siong.  After  the\r\n\r\nrebellion in Brunei the Barisan Sosialis came  out\r\n\r\nto  give full support to the rebellion and to  the\r\n\r\nself-styled  revolutionist hiding in  a  hotel  in\r\n\r\nManila,  and  they  termed  him  a  hero  of   the\r\n\r\nliberation    of   Brunei.   Yet    they    failed\r\n\r\ndisastrously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brunei is an oil producing country, a rich\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  the people do not have  taxes  like\r\n\r\nincome  tax,  cigarette tax, oil  tax,  and  other\r\n\r\ntaxes.  What reason do they have to rebel  against\r\n\r\nauthority?  And now Azahari has fled to  Indonesia\r\n\r\nto become a stooge of Dr Subandrio and to be used\r\n\r\nas an exhibit at mass rallies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a very clear example of their collaboration\r\n\r\nand  collusion with a foreign enemy to destroy our\r\n\r\ncountry.   I   recall  that  at   the   Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nConference  at  Moshi  last  year  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ndelegates tried to bar our delegates from entering\r\n\r\nthe  conference room. Yet they were very concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  Barisan delegate. Mr Lim  Shee  Ping,\r\n\r\nbecause Mr Lim Shee Ping was detained during  his\r\n\r\njourney and could not attend the conference.  They\r\n\r\nwere  very  worried and concerned. They asked  us,\r\n\r\n\"Why  is it that a partner of yours has not turned\r\n\r\nup?\"  In  fact, at that time we did not know  that\r\n\r\nMr Lim Shee Ping had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndetained. When the Indonesian delegates knew  that\r\n\r\nMr Lim Shee Ping could not attend the conference,\r\n\r\nthey mobilised all their efforts to lobby all  the\r\n\r\ndelegates to prevent us from participating in  the\r\n\r\nconference.  And at the sub-committee meeting  the\r\n\r\nanti-Malaysian  forces  were  able  to   gain   an\r\n\r\noverwhelming control over the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can see that before the conference\r\n\r\nthe    fanatics   against   Malaysia   must   have\r\n\r\nestablished  contact  through  correspondence  and\r\n\r\nthey  must  have tried to make use of the  Barisan\r\n\r\ndelegate  to be the main mouthpiece at  the  Afro-Asian Conference against Malaysia. Because Mr Lim\r\n\r\nShee   Ping  could  not  turn  up,  they  had   no\r\n\r\nalternative  but  to  use two so-called  delegates\r\n\r\nfrom Indonesia to represent the Barisan delegates.\r\n\r\nThis is another example of the Barisan's collusion\r\n\r\nwith the foreign enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present difficult economic situation was\r\n\r\nbrought about by them, and yet they have the cheek\r\n\r\nto  put  in  an amendment blaming us  for  causing\r\n\r\ndifficulties  to  the  people  as  a   result   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Without the Barisan  Sosialis,  we  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaysia will be the happiest people  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia, but because of them we have a lot\r\n\r\nof   difficulties  and  hardships  and   so   much\r\n\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in their amendment the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  also  mention the  false  imposition  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on  the  people. What do  they  mean  by\r\n\r\nimposition? We do not have to talk about Sabah and\r\n\r\nSarawak.  Let  us talk about Singapore.  Within  a\r\n\r\nyear  there have been two occasions for the people\r\n\r\nto vote on the question whether they like Malaysia\r\n\r\nor  not.  That was on the 1st September, 1962.  On\r\n\r\nthat day more than 70 per cent of the people voted\r\n\r\nfor   Malaysia  and  rejected  their  blank   vote\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  Although the voting  was  compulsory,\r\n\r\nthere were three choices, and they freely accepted\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Are not the people's eyes  very  clear?\r\n\r\nThe  second  occasion was in September  this  year\r\n\r\n- the general elections. We put forward Malaysia as\r\n\r\none of our Party platforms and as a result of that\r\n\r\nwe won a great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: l79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority. Whether it was a snap election  or  not,\r\n\r\nthey  had  nine days to campaign. And in all  this\r\n\r\ntime   they   had  consistently  and  persistently\r\n\r\ncarried  out their anti-Malaysia campaign for  two\r\n\r\nand  a half years. Yet they were defeated. Now  in\r\n\r\nthose general elections, the Barisan Sosialis  put\r\n\r\nforward  anti-Malaysia as their election platform.\r\n\r\nWhat  was the outcome? They had only 13 seats,  an\r\n\r\nunlucky  number.  And today  among  them  one  has\r\n\r\ndisappeared,  their  Party leader,  Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh.  And  their  three other Members  have  also\r\n\r\ndisappeared from this House. Where are they now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  they have secured only thirteen  Assembly\r\n\r\nseats  - the unlucky number of thirteen! Today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen even the Member for Bukit Merah is  not\r\n\r\nhere.  Perhaps  there  is another  crisis  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say is that the recent general\r\n\r\nelections  were  conducted  in  a  most  free  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  way. Those who are for Malaysia  voted\r\n\r\nfor our candidates; those who are against Malaysia\r\n\r\nvoted for Barisan candidates. How can you say that\r\n\r\nanybody has imposed Malaysia on the people? If the\r\n\r\nlogic  of  the Barisan were correct that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nhad  been  imposed  on  the people,  then  we  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House would also be an imposition\r\n\r\non\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe people, including the Barisan Members. Whether\r\n\r\nthey  have  made their Assembly seats  a  kind  of\r\n\r\nimposition  on  the people is another  matter.  If\r\n\r\nthey  admit  it, then their seats are  a  kind  of\r\n\r\nimposition  on the people, and they should  vacate\r\n\r\nthem.  But  I will say that the people  voted  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia by a free and democratic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the question of\r\n\r\nthe four streams of education. On the question  of\r\n\r\nChinese education, the Barisan slogans are usually\r\n\r\nlike   this,  that  we  want  to  destroy  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.  Now,  what  do  they  know  about  the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of Chinese education?  What  do  they\r\n\r\nmean?   Take,   for   instance,   Thailand,    the\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Indonesia. What about the attitude\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  in  these  countries  against\r\n\r\nChinese  schools? Now, this is a real  example  of\r\n\r\nattempts  to destroy Chinese education. But,  here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, is the P.A.P. Government trying  to\r\n\r\ndestroy Chinese education? On what grounds do they\r\n\r\nraise these groundless accusations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Members of the Barisan, are or educated\r\n\r\npurely  in Chinese. Now, please think of the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  you  were educated in Chinese schools.  What\r\n\r\nwas  the situation then, and what is the situation\r\n\r\ntoday?   Would   you  please   compare   the   two\r\n\r\nsituations?   If  the  Barisan  Members   have   a\r\n\r\nconscience,   they  should  admit   that   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation nowadays is very much better than it was\r\n\r\nbefore.  Nowadays it is not necessary  to  mention\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  they  were  educated  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just give an example in my case. My\r\n\r\nparents had to save money to send me and people of\r\n\r\nmy  generation  to primary schools. But  nowadays,\r\n\r\njust  look at the present Chinese primary schools.\r\n\r\nThe  children do not have to pay for anything.  If\r\n\r\nit   was  not  for  the  confrontation  policy  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  we would have achieved free  secondary\r\n\r\neducation. Those children whose families are  poor\r\n\r\ncan   be  provided  with  free  textbooks  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Now,  please consider  this.  Do  you\r\n\r\nthink this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the way to destroy Chinese education? I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that this is a concrete example to show  that\r\n\r\nChinese education nowadays is enjoying much better\r\n\r\nfacilities than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, if you wanted to join a school, you\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  ask people to recommend  you,  to\r\n\r\npersuade  perhaps the principals  or  teachers  in\r\n\r\ncertain schools to let you have a place in school.\r\n\r\nBut just look around now. Now, the children do not\r\n\r\nhave  to do such things. They have no fear of  not\r\n\r\ngetting  a  place in school. Any child wishing  to\r\n\r\njoin  any school, whether a Tamil, or a Malay,  or\r\n\r\nan  English or a Chinese school, would be given  a\r\n\r\nplace in a school nearest to his or her home. This\r\n\r\nis  a second point to show how much better Chinese\r\n\r\neducation is treated nowadays than it was  in  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is, in the past, teachers in\r\n\r\nChinese   schools  would  have  to  try  to   make\r\n\r\nblandishments to those on top who had  control  of\r\n\r\nthe schools in order to retain their position.  On\r\n\r\ntop  of  this, their salaries were not stable,  or\r\n\r\nrather,  in the primary schools the salaries  were\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  the principals  who  could  impose\r\n\r\ntheir  will. Sometimes teachers did not get  their\r\n\r\nsalaries at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can recall an example of my old friend, Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Keng Seng of the Barisan Sosialis, when  he\r\n\r\nwas  principal for the first time in 1955. At that\r\n\r\ntime  we were still friends. When he received  his\r\n\r\nsalary  he  used to ask me to go for a drive  with\r\n\r\nhim to have dinner together. But sometimes when it\r\n\r\nwas time for him to give me a treat, he did not do\r\n\r\nso.  For  what reason? It was because he  had  not\r\n\r\nreceived the salary due to him at the right  time,\r\n\r\nso he had no money to give me a treat, because the\r\n\r\nprimary school in which he was teaching would have\r\n\r\nto  wait  for  the school fees to be paid  by  the\r\n\r\npupils  before the school could issue salaries  to\r\n\r\nthe teachers. In the rural areas, in the kampongs,\r\n\r\nif  the pupils of a school could not afford to pay\r\n\r\ntheir  school fees, then the school would have  to\r\n\r\ndelay the payment of salaries to the teachers, and\r\n\r\nthe teachers would have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  tighten their belts! But now the situation  is\r\n\r\nentirely  different. Now, the payment of  salaries\r\n\r\nto the teachers does not depend on the school fees\r\n\r\npaid by the pupils, because the whole burden is on\r\n\r\nthe  Government. The teachers also  have  definite\r\n\r\nsalary   scales,  annual  increments   and   other\r\n\r\nbenefits. They get their salary on time regularly,\r\n\r\nand they are well treated. Those teachers who have\r\n\r\ntaught for more than ten years can get quarters or\r\n\r\nbuy cars for themselves. Our old friend, Mr Leong\r\n\r\nKeng  Seng,  after having been a school  principal\r\n\r\nfor  a few years, would at least have enough money\r\n\r\nto buy a car --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I do not know why the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nhas  to  mention  Mr  Leong  Keng  Seng.

I have\r\n\r\nno  intention at all to attack him but the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  keep on harping that they are  champions\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  education. That is  why  I  mentioned\r\n\r\ncertain facts and episodes to rebut what they have\r\n\r\nsaid.  That is why I mentioned my old friend,  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Keng  Seng.  I  did not  say  that  he  was\r\n\r\ncorrupted or that he had misused the money, but  I\r\n\r\nonly mentioned that he could have used his salary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  buy  a car. I am only reflecting by comparison\r\n\r\nthat our Government is really very generous in its\r\n\r\ntreatment of Chinese education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now continue with Chinese education in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Teachers engaged in Chinese  education\r\n\r\nare actually the most highly paid Chinese teachers\r\n\r\nin  the  whole world. Can you pick out any country\r\n\r\nwhere teachers of Chinese are paid more than those\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?  Let  us take,  for  instance,  the\r\n\r\nChinese mainland or Hong Kong where there is  also\r\n\r\nChinese  education.  Do  the  teachers  there  get\r\n\r\nsalaries as high as those we are paying here? Take\r\n\r\nalso,   for   instance,  Taiwan,   where   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  is  in existence. Are the  teachers  in\r\n\r\nChinese  schools there being paid more than  those\r\n\r\nhere?  The  Chinese primary school  teachers  here\r\n\r\ncompared with their counterparts in other parts of\r\n\r\nthe  world are very much better treated and  paid.\r\n\r\nFrom  where do they get their salaries? Of course,\r\n\r\nthey  get  them from the Government. Can  you  say\r\n\r\nthat this is bad treatment of Chinese education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the past, Chinese school\r\n\r\nteachers who were relatives of the principals were\r\n\r\nemployed as teachers in those principals' schools,\r\n\r\nirrespective of their past experience or  academic\r\n\r\nor  professional qualifications. As a result, they\r\n\r\nhad  wronged  not  only themselves  but  also  the\r\n\r\npupils  under  their care and the  schools  became\r\n\r\nschool  shops or commercial institutes.  But  now,\r\n\r\nlet  us  look  at Chinese education in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nChinese  education in our Chinese schools is  very\r\n\r\nmuch  better. All the teachers are being  trained,\r\n\r\nand we can also say that this is the only place in\r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia where Chinese school teachers  are\r\n\r\ngiven  training facilities. We should be proud  of\r\n\r\nthis   fact.  Therefore,  through  this  teachers'\r\n\r\ntraining scheme the teaching standards in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  can  be raised and Chinese education  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to develop and flourished. Would you term\r\n\r\nthis as destruction of Chinese education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Barisan Members\r\n\r\nrepeatedly say that they are champions  of  Nantah\r\n\r\n(Nanyang  University). Does Nantah belong  to  you\r\n\r\nalone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible. Everyone in Singapore has  a\r\n\r\nshare  in Nantah. Nantah cannot be monopolised  by\r\n\r\nthis  minority  group. Their attitudes  and  their\r\n\r\nways cannot justify themselves in the eyes of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore.  These  people  have   been\r\n\r\nshouting   about  Chinese  education  in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and yet they have never abided  by  the\r\n\r\nNanyang University Ordinance. In October we held a\r\n\r\nNanyang  University consultative  meeting  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the resignation of Mr Tan Lark  Sye.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a person called Poh Seng See went to  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  claiming himself to be a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Nantah, ignoring the  fact  that  any\r\n\r\nrepresentative sent out by the Council should be a\r\n\r\nmember of the proper body of Nantah. To qualify as\r\n\r\na  member of Nantah University, one condition  has\r\n\r\nto   be   satisfied.  According  to  the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Ordinance, anybody who has contributed\r\n\r\n$1,000  to  the University can become a member  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University.  Has the  Member  for  Jurong\r\n\r\ncontributed $1,000? Is he a member of the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity?  How is it that they  could  show  off\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  members of the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nCouncil to attend the Council meeting? The Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Ordinance  also  provides   that   the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Nanyang  University  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion   should  be  the  Vice-Chancellor  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity, but this was not so. According to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the Constitution of the Students' Union\r\n\r\nalso provides that the financial statement of  the\r\n\r\nStudents'   Union  should  be  approved   by   the\r\n\r\nUniversity Council. But this has never been  done.\r\n\r\nHave  they  complied  with the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nOrdinance?  They  have never done  so.  They  have\r\n\r\nmonopolised  Nanyang University as if it  belonged\r\n\r\nto  them for the training of their personal cadres\r\n\r\nto  create political disturbances and strikes.  In\r\n\r\nOctober, these people boycotted their classes  and\r\n\r\nwent out to the Padang to lie in the sun. What  is\r\n\r\nthis?  And when they were asked to disperse,  they\r\n\r\nrefused to do so. This is really incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nEven  during the holidays, they refused  to  leave\r\n\r\nthe  University. What is all this? They said  that\r\n\r\nthey wanted to stay in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  University  campus  in  order  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nUniversity  Week projects. This is  ridiculous.  I\r\n\r\nnote  that  on 28th November, the Students'  Union\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a  plan  on  University  Week  to   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Senate, but the Council of  Deans  did\r\n\r\nnot  approve  it  because  according  to  it,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity Council would have to spend $20,000. So\r\n\r\nthe  Council did not approve the plan,  and  since\r\n\r\nthe  money  was  not forthcoming, how  could  they\r\n\r\ncarry  out  University  Week projects?  University\r\n\r\nWeek was not held for the first time this year. In\r\n\r\nthe   past,  there  were  several  occasions  when\r\n\r\nUniversity  Week  projects were carried  out  when\r\n\r\nthey  did  not stay in the University  campus.  On\r\n\r\npast  occasions, they took part in University Week\r\n\r\nonly  after the University had reopened when  they\r\n\r\nwent  to  meet in the Auditorium. Why should  they\r\n\r\nnow  want  to  stay in the University campus  this\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Members sitting in this House today\r\n\r\nshould  thank the Nanyang University students  for\r\n\r\nhaving done their best to canvass for them. Day in\r\n\r\nand day out, lorry-loads of students went round to\r\n\r\ndo  propaganda work everywhere. Is this a kind  of\r\n\r\nacademic exercise? It is not. And they also  went\r\n\r\nround  to  collect money for the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nIs  this  also  a kind of academic activity?  They\r\n\r\nthink  that they only can criticise other  people,\r\n\r\nbut  when  they are criticised by others they  say\r\n\r\nthat  other people are obstructing their  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  and  destroying Chinese education.  These\r\n\r\nare  all outmoded slogans. Is election campaigning\r\n\r\na  kind  of academic activity? Is staying  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   campus  also  a  kind   of   academic\r\n\r\nactivity? We know that the real purpose  of  their\r\n\r\nremaining in the University campus is to  obstruct\r\n\r\nthe    efforts   of   the   Government   and   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the University Council to reach\r\n\r\nan  agreement.  On  the 4th  of  December  in  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  Siang Pau, there was a statement made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of  the Students'  Union  that  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the graduates remaining in the  campus\r\n\r\nwas  to  make full use of the vacation  so  as  to\r\n\r\ncarry out preparatory work for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity  Week projects? What did they  mean  by\r\n\r\nthat?  In actual fact, it was not really necessary\r\n\r\nfor them to remain in the University campus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, the Member for Jurong said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has suppressed the University  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers  in  the  Naval Base.  What  actually\r\n\r\nhappened  is  that there was one Communist  worker\r\n\r\nwho   assaulted  another  worker  whose  name  was\r\n\r\nLatiff.  This  particular worker, Latiff  did  not\r\n\r\nobey the directives of the union in calling out an\r\n\r\nillegal strike. He resisted the attempt, and as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  he was assaulted brutally. Now,  who  was\r\n\r\nbrutal?   Who  made  the  assault?  It   is   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in the union who had carried  out  the\r\n\r\nassault against an innocent worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong urged us to check our horse\r\n\r\non  the precipice. I will say that it is they  who\r\n\r\nshould pull up their horse before they plunge into\r\n\r\nthe  ravine. Their friend, Mr Lim Shee Ping,  has\r\n\r\nnow  turned over a new leaf. And it is their  turn\r\n\r\nto  turn over a new leaf in their lives. What have\r\n\r\nthey  to  struggle for? They will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  their  aims. Theirs is  an  authoritarian\r\n\r\nregime.   They   can  only  create   trouble   and\r\n\r\nbloodshed.   I  believe  they  will  not   achieve\r\n\r\nanything  during our life-time. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nthey who should pull up their horse before they go\r\n\r\nany  further. What they are doing have  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other friend, the Member for Nee Soon, has\r\n\r\ndisappeared  for some time. What  is  the  use  of\r\n\r\nhiding somewhere? Where can he hide? For how  long\r\n\r\ncan  he  hide?  There  is  no  way  out  for  him.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  my advice to them is that they  should\r\n\r\npull  up  their horse before they go any  further.\r\n\r\nThey  should  not  persist in their  anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nstruggle  to their own destruction. They can  turn\r\n\r\nback.  It  will be good for them if they can  turn\r\n\r\nback. It will be good for the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand for the people in Malaysia as a whole, if they\r\n\r\ncan turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In\r\n\r\nthese  proceedings  today,  many  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell  as the Government have added their views  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion. When the Assembly resumed its sitting\r\n\r\nat 2.30 p.m. this afternoon, some Members spoke on\r\n\r\nthe   motion  moved  by  the  Prime  Minister.   I\r\n\r\npersonally  feel  that, apart from  attacking  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and the pro-Communists, the Government\r\n\r\nBenches  do  not  seem to have  anything  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout. Just to attack the Communists is not a wise\r\n\r\napproach.  Ngoh  Dinh Diem of South  Vietnam  also\r\n\r\ntreated  the monks as Communists. And so  has  our\r\n\r\nfriend,   Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew,  who   brands   any\r\n\r\nprogressive opponent as a Communist. He will  call\r\n\r\nevery opponent of his a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of a majority, or minority, as\r\n\r\ntouched  upon by the Prime Minister, interests  me\r\n\r\nin  this  way. Although we are a minority in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, outside this House the broad masses of  the\r\n\r\npeople  are in sympathy with us. The last  general\r\n\r\nelection  was  conducted in  a  most  undemocratic\r\n\r\nmanner  and  it  was  won by the  P.A.P. in  that\r\n\r\nmanner. Our leaders were arrested. Many legitimate\r\n\r\nassociations  and  unions were banned  before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   election.   Yet  in   spite   of   these\r\n\r\nundemocratic  conditions, there were some  300,000\r\n\r\nvoters who supported us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Nanyang University. The policy\r\n\r\nof   the  P.A.P. to  think  that  businessmen  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are unable to run any university  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat insult to the intelligence of businessmen in\r\n\r\nSingapore. They claim themselves to be experts  in\r\n\r\nuniversity  education.  But  they  have  not  done\r\n\r\nanything  to  help  Nanyang  University.  So   far\r\n\r\nNanyang University has not received a single  cent\r\n\r\nfrom  them.  Can the P.A.P. give aid and  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  to  Nanyang  University  unconditionally?\r\n\r\nThey  say that the University is being run by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  There  is  no  autonomy  in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. Now all the facts have come  to  prove\r\n\r\nthe  mistakes of the Prime Minister in making this\r\n\r\nallegation. The Nanyang University Students' Union\r\n\r\nhas  all  along  been supported by the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia for their work, and to  say\r\n\r\nthat  their activities during University Week  are\r\n\r\nCommunist activities is absurd.

To  say  such activities  are  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities  is  an insult to the people  who  take\r\n\r\npart in them and who support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. in giving aid to Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwants  to have the condition that interference  is\r\n\r\npermitted - in other words, they want to  give  you\r\n\r\naid   with   certain  strings.   They   say   that\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in Singapore are unable  to  run  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.  That means that only P.A.P. men  are\r\n\r\nable to run it. If they are not P.A.P., then not a\r\n\r\nsingle  cent  will  be given. That  is  not  quite\r\n\r\ncorrect. Insofar as aid is to be given to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  the  P.A.P. has  not  done  anything\r\n\r\nconcrete   to  help.  Even  on  the  question   of\r\n\r\nbursaries  - in  spite of what the  Government  has\r\n\r\nsaid  and  its promise to help the poor  students,\r\n\r\nwhat has the Government actually done? What is the\r\n\r\namount of money given to the poor students? A  sum\r\n\r\nof  some  $600,000  has  been  allocated  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  bursaries.  Actually  only  half  the\r\n\r\namount has been spent, and the other half is still\r\n\r\ndangling  in  the air. Why? We do  not  understand\r\n\r\nwhy. The list of recipients has not been published\r\n\r\nthis  year and we do not know the total amount  of\r\n\r\nbursaries granted to the students this year.  Now,\r\n\r\nwhat is actually the game they are playing? We  do\r\n\r\nnot   understand  why  two  students  have   their\r\n\r\nbursaries  recalled. Can all this  show  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  really  interested   in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity?  The  Central  Government   tried   to\r\n\r\nsuppress  Nanyang  University  by  arresting  some\r\n\r\nNanyang students on the 8th of October. All  these\r\n\r\nfacts, and the action of the Central Government in\r\n\r\narresting and assaulting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   under-graduates,  show  that   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  unreasonable and barbaric  towards\r\n\r\nNanyang  University.  Is the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\ncollaborating  in  these actions  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour talked about the Barisan Sosialis Members in this House. From his speech we can go one step further and know what kind of a political Party the P.A.P. is; what kind of\r\n\r\ndemocracy they are talking about. What is the true\r\n\r\nmeaning of democracy they are talking about?  They\r\n\r\nare trying to brag about their victory and the so-called  support of the people. If they are  really\r\n\r\ngetting the support of the people, why should they\r\n\r\nbe   so  apprehensive  of  the  true  meaning   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy?  Of our struggle through constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans?  Why  should  they  be  so  afraid  of  our\r\n\r\nlegitimate  political activities by constitutional\r\n\r\nmeans?  Is  the P.A.P. today really interested  in\r\n\r\nstruggling   with   the   Barisan   Sosialis    by\r\n\r\nconstitutional means? Or is it more interested  in\r\n\r\ngetting  the support of the Central Government  in\r\n\r\nusing   Fascist  measures  against   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis?  We  have heard from the horse's  mouth,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Minister  for  Labour's,  the   true\r\n\r\nmeaning of democracy in their dictionary.  We  ask\r\n\r\nthem  one question. Are we safe as Members of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly? Do we have personal security\r\n\r\nas Members of the Legislative Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the severance of trade between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Indonesia, the Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nsays  that  it is because of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nthat such a situation has arisen and all the blame\r\n\r\nmust  be shouldered by the Barisan Sosialis. I  am\r\n\r\nnot   clear  whether  he  and  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation have read the booklet published  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  on A Year  of  Achievement,\r\n\r\nprinting  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech.  I\r\n\r\nmake  a  quotation for the purpose  of  record.  I\r\n\r\nquote  the  reasons given by the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara for the confrontation. Let them listen to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis. Members will note that the confrontation put\r\n\r\nup by Indonesia against Malaysia has caused regret\r\n\r\namong  the people. Let us read the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech made on the 29th of  November  in\r\n\r\nthis  House in which he gave the reasons  for  the\r\n\r\nconfrontation. Have the Ministers  read  this?  If\r\n\r\nnot, let me read it [col. 117]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... whether \"confrontation\" at present confined\r\n\r\nto  a  trade boycott of Singapore and Penang,  and\r\n\r\nmilitary pressure along the borders of Sarawak  is\r\n\r\ncontained  and held, and slowly resolved,  depends\r\n\r\nupon the policy settled by the Central Government,\r\n\r\nnot that of any member State Government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the control is in the hands of the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, then how can the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  blame  the Barisan Sosialis for  all  this\r\n\r\nconfrontation  and  its  consequences?   Let   the\r\n\r\nMinisters   and   Members   opposite   read    His\r\n\r\nExcellency's speech!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What causes us amazement is that the Ministers\r\n\r\nand  important  people opposite do not  understand\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  would  like to say something  more  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  my argument. I would like to  ask,  is\r\n\r\nIndonesia  not  an independent country?  Would  it\r\n\r\nhave  to follow Barisan's directions to carry  out\r\n\r\nits confrontation policy? Does Indonesia have  to\r\n\r\ntake  directions from the Barisan?  Even  a  child\r\n\r\nwill understand this. But these people opposite do\r\n\r\nnot even know this simplest Common sense question:\r\n\r\nHow   can   this  independent  sovereign   country\r\n\r\n(Indonesia)  take  instructions from  a  political\r\n\r\nParty  in a non-independent foreign State?  It  is\r\n\r\nmost  ridiculous to believe this. Indonesia is  an\r\n\r\nindependent sovereign country and it has  its  own\r\n\r\npower  and  discretion to decide its own policies.\r\n\r\nConfrontation is a policy exercised  by  Indonesia\r\n\r\nin  such  a  way.  The  Barisan  Sosialis,  as   a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party,  also have a  right  to  express\r\n\r\ntheir  own  thoughts  and  political  ideas.  They\r\n\r\npropose    that    this   crisis   arising    from\r\n\r\nconfrontation  should  be  resolved  by   peaceful\r\n\r\nconsultations  between the Central  Government  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia. But up to now, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\noligarchy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   not  tried  to  do  so.  Has  the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment adopted this peaceful means  or  is  it\r\n\r\nstepping  up the supply of armaments to  launch  a\r\n\r\nhot  war to deal with confrontation? There are two\r\n\r\nalternatives: one is by peaceful means; the  other\r\n\r\nis  by  force.  Today,  the confrontation  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Indonesia is caused by  reactionary\r\n\r\nelements  in  Britain as well as in Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. does  not  only  want  to  curb  the  evil\r\n\r\nconsequences  but  it is also  giving  support  to\r\n\r\nthese activities. This only goes to show that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is a stooge in this neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour bragged about academic freedom and educational equality. I will only give an example to rebut his statement. At the ninth milestone, Tampines, there is a school which has been in existence for 40 years. What has happened to this school now? The land has been confiscated\r\n\r\nto  make  way  for  an airport; the  teachers  are\r\n\r\njobless  and the students have been absorbed  into\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools.  Is  this an  example  of  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  for the four streams of education?  Now\r\n\r\nlet  us  look  at  the treatment received  by  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore and Nanyang  University.\r\n\r\nThe  University  of  Singapore has  received  many\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars  as  aid,  whereas   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity has not received a single cent from the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Is this equality of treatment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talks about prosperity in Singapore. I want to tell him that this is only a superficial phenomenon. In spite of many foreigners coming to Singapore, in spite of some people and the Ministers owning houses and cars, the number of unemployed people is increasing day\r\n\r\nby  day.  In every corner of Singapore we can  see\r\n\r\nbeggars  begging  for money. Is  this  a  sign  of\r\n\r\nprosperity?  We  can  also see  people  committing\r\n\r\nsuicide   by   jumping  from  high  multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nbuildings.  Hawkers,  whether  they  are  on   the\r\n\r\nthoroughfares or in the backlanes, are  everywhere\r\n\r\nto  be found. This is because they cannot find any\r\n\r\nother  jobs. They are therefore compelled to hawk.\r\n\r\nWe  admit  that  Singapore is  placed  in  a  very\r\n\r\nadvantageous geographical position. If we can make\r\n\r\nuse of this geographical position and put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour port to good use, we will be able to solve our\r\n\r\nproblems of livelihood and the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  then  be able to enjoy the same comforts  as\r\n\r\nare  enjoyed  by the Ministers. But what  are  the\r\n\r\nfacts  today?  They talk about the free  education\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by  the children here as  an  example  to\r\n\r\nprove that we are heading for prosperity. But free\r\n\r\nprimary  education is paid for by the people.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. also  talk about the achievements  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board and the raising  of\r\n\r\nthe  people's  standard  of  living.  Many  people\r\n\r\nliving in Selegie House have to pay $96.50 a month\r\n\r\nfor  a three-room flat, excluding water and light!\r\n\r\nIf they are earning only $100 to $200 a month, how\r\n\r\ncan  they  afford  to  pay  such  a  high  rental?\r\n\r\nAlthough  such  people are living in  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  flats,  they  have  to  starve\r\n\r\nthemselves and lead a miserable life because  they\r\n\r\ncannot  build  attap houses in other  places.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is the biggest landlord acting  through\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  fattened  itself on the revenue derived  from\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board rentals. We can\r\n\r\nclearly   see  that.  The  Mountbatten  area   was\r\n\r\noriginally  a  rich people's area, and  the  votes\r\n\r\nthat  we  got from this area were cast  by  people\r\n\r\nliving  in  Housing and Development  Board  fiats.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  that they are dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\npresent Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister talked about better treatment for the workers, but there are many workers who are laid off by the management and who are compelled to take up jobs at very low pay - from $2 to $3 a day. He also talked about the increasing number of motor-cycles to show that we have prosperity in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Such promises cannot  hold  water.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  most  of those who ride on motor-cycles  are\r\n\r\nthe poor workers who have to ply their trade. They\r\n\r\nare  not  like  the Ministers who have  cars.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  also talked about public assistance  and\r\n\r\nrelief  to fire victims. When we visited the  fire\r\n\r\nvictims,  they told us that their future was  very\r\n\r\nbleak. Their monthly income was only $100 to $200.\r\n\r\nThey wondered whether they could afford to stay in\r\n\r\na Housing Board flat. Now that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  houses had been devastated by fire and  all\r\n\r\ntheir  personal belongings lost, they have to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher  rentals  if they want to stay  in  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats. They have gone through misfortune and\r\n\r\nnow  the  Government want to impose high rents  on\r\n\r\nthem.  In  fact, the Government want to clear  the\r\n\r\nfire  site  in order to build other Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats so that they can earn income from rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about Singapore being the New York of Malaysia, but unemployed workers are becoming more numerous and this is what they call the New York of Malaysia!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. helped the British Government and the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to impose Malaysia  on  the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore,   thus   bringing   about\r\n\r\nmisfortune   to  the  people  of  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  also talked about Malaysia being  unable\r\n\r\nto  encircle  Indonesia. It does  not  concern  us\r\n\r\nwhether  the  present  attitude  of  Indonesia  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  or  not.  Whether  a  small  country  can\r\n\r\nsurround a big country is another matter, but  the\r\n\r\npast  two  World Wars have shown that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nsmall   countries   which   surrounded   the   big\r\n\r\ncountries. Japan, being a small country, was  able\r\n\r\nto  surround a big country such as China, and this\r\n\r\nis  a  very  good  example to show  that  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  is  capable of aggression against  a  big\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about the Afro-Asian Conference in Moshi. The Ministers of the P.A.P. did not condemn the brutal act committed by the Central Government in arresting one of our representatives. This only shows that the P.A.P. delegates were not supported by the delegates in\r\n\r\nthe Afro-Asian Conference at Moshi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the strike at the Naval Base, it is the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who broke it up and caused misery  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers there. What is the attitude of the P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nDo  they want to oppose the Central Government, or\r\n\r\ndo they want to support it in regard to the strike\r\n\r\nat  the Naval Base? The workers staged a strike at\r\n\r\nthe  Naval  Base  in order to raise  their  living\r\n\r\nstandard, but their strike was sabotaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo  the  P.A.P. agree to the action taken  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government or do they support the workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about Mr Lim Shee Ping. We do not know the real position of Mr Lim Shee Ping because he is not here. Now, if the statement allegedly made by him is false, then the Central Government is very mean in falsifying his statement. This is a very low tactic, using the\r\n\r\nthreat of life imprisonment to force detainees  to\r\n\r\ngive up their political convictions and to prevent\r\n\r\nthem   from   carrying   out   their   legal   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional  struggle  by  banning  them   from\r\n\r\ncarrying  out their political activities.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the Member for Toa Payoh, it is the  same\r\n\r\ncase  of the Central Government trying to suppress\r\n\r\ntheir political opponents. Now, what is the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nattitude  on this question? They do not side  with\r\n\r\nthe   people  but  instead  they  side  with   the\r\n\r\nreactionary Central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about the labour policy mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. I am of the opinion that this labour policy is detrimental to the interests of the workers. If the P.A.P. oligarchy are genuinely interested in looking after the interests of the\r\n\r\nworkers,  then  they  should  alter  their  labour\r\n\r\npolicy.  The  labour  policy clearly  reveals  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s reactionary anti-worker stand. They  have\r\n\r\nnot changed this stand. All these facts prove that\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  sacrifice  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in order to appease the foreign investors\r\n\r\nand  their  insatiable demands  for  profits.  The\r\n\r\nlabour policy for the next five years will not see\r\n\r\nany   changes.  They  will  be  anti-worker,  more\r\n\r\nreactionary and more detrimental to the  interests\r\n\r\nof the workers in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what is stated in the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech, we can see this. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntouch  on  several points. One point is  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. want to strengthen their hand to  exercise\r\n\r\ntheir  control  of the workers by introducing  new\r\n\r\ntrade union legislation into the House. On the so-called educating the workers and the training of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders, we are of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. will make use of the N.T.U.C., which is\r\n\r\na  stooge of the P.A.P., and make use of the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board under the control  of  Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair  to  deceive  and to manipulate  the  working\r\n\r\nmasses.  In  implementing  their  so-called   four\r\n\r\nstreams of education for the workers, it will mean\r\n\r\nthat   the   workers  will   be   forced   to   be\r\n\r\nindoctrinated by their so-called education. If the\r\n\r\nworkers  do  not want to be trained in their  way,\r\n\r\nthen  the workers will not be able to get any jobs\r\n\r\nin  the foreign-controlled firms. What will be the\r\n\r\nresult  of the so-called training of the  workers?\r\n\r\nThey  will  only  be  trained to  become  stooges,\r\n\r\nriding  over the heads of the working masses.  The\r\n\r\nsole  point is that the P.A.P. will set up  a  so-called committee composed of representatives  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government, employees and the employers. Now,\r\n\r\nlet  us  examine this proposal. The P.A.P. in  its\r\n\r\nnature is thoroughly anti-worker, and these  three\r\n\r\npropositions will further increase its reactionary\r\n\r\npower  and  authority  to  prevent  workers   from\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  popular trade  unions  and  their\r\n\r\ntrade union leaders -for instance, to prevent  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of the popular Commercial  and  Factory\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union.  It  raises  the  myth   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist bogey to carry out its tactics, and even\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Ministry cannot deny that  the  union\r\n\r\nwhich   I  mentioned  earlier  has  thousands   of\r\n\r\nmembers. Now, that is the first intention  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the P.A.P. want to carry\r\n\r\nout   their  so-called  measures  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nworkers from being indoctrinated and influenced by\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. Anyone who is not satisfied  with\r\n\r\nthe  present  P.A.P. political policy  or  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  his  living  conditions  will  be\r\n\r\ndubbed as a Communist by the P.A.P. Now the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  to introduce a new trade union law the  main\r\n\r\npurpose  of which is for the reason which  I  have\r\n\r\njust pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that the P.A.P. say is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is trying to improve the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  employer and employee and to improve  the\r\n\r\neconomy, but from our point of view the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  economic situation is  the  result  of  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  economic system inherited by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nIf  such  an  economic situation is  not  changed,\r\n\r\nthere   will  be  no  improvement  in  the  living\r\n\r\nconditions  of the workers. The P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\neconomic   policy   is   to   encourage    foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists to exploit our workers further and not\r\n\r\nto  encourage our national capitalists to  develop\r\n\r\nour industries. Instead, the P.A.P. is encouraging\r\n\r\nforeign  monopolists to compete with our  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists and investors. Furthermore, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  going to introduce a new Trade Union Ordinance\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the workers from staging strikes.  To\r\n\r\nsum up, the purpose of the P.A.P. in doing this is\r\n\r\nto  treat the workers of Singapore as serfs in the\r\n\r\nfeudal  system in order to enable the  capitalists\r\n\r\nand  other exploiters to scrape their profits from\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these are the three main reasons for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy.  This sugar-coating  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy will further encourage  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists  to exploit our workers in  all  ways.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  very unfortunate in  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nsituation and yet the P.A.P. are looking  for  the\r\n\r\nworst  to  happen. They are not  keen  to  seek  a\r\n\r\nbetter future for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, we can describe the P.A.P. as being\r\n\r\nbiased.  The  introduction  of  their  legislation\r\n\r\nconcerning the Trade Unions Ordinance  is  out  of\r\n\r\npolitical  motivation and not with the  object  of\r\n\r\nlooking  after the interests of the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nmain purpose of the legislation will be to control\r\n\r\nand suppress these large trade unions supported by\r\n\r\nthe progressive workers in order to put them under\r\n\r\nthe  control of such puppet trade unions as  those\r\n\r\nunder  Devan Nair. This is a repetition  of  their\r\n\r\npast evil deeds and it has also now reached a  new\r\n\r\nstage in their scheme of repression. They are  not\r\n\r\ncontented with arresting trade union leaders. They\r\n\r\nhave  gone further and banned seven trade  unions.\r\n\r\nThey  even intend to go a step further and destroy\r\n\r\nall other unions which are really fighting for the\r\n\r\ninterest of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's refusal to allow the workers to\r\n\r\norganise  themselves into unions to improve  their\r\n\r\nworking  conditions is a direct interference  with\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of the workers. Why is  it  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  so very interested in introducing  new\r\n\r\nlegislation  of  such  a  nature  as  to  exercise\r\n\r\nstricter  control  over trade unions?  This  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  that is worth our careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  that the Ministers of the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nvery  afraid  of the people being aware  of  their\r\n\r\nbasic  rights.  This also goes to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers are trying their  very  best  to\r\n\r\nfoster  their own unions against the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers in general. The objective  conditions\r\n\r\nare  not in favour of the P.A.P. and their stooges\r\n\r\nin the trade union field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P.-controlled unions cannot stand where\r\n\r\ntrue  unions exist, because such true  unions  are\r\n\r\nfighting for the interests of the workers and  are\r\n\r\ngetting  the  support of the workers  in  general;\r\n\r\nwhereas the P.A.P.-controlled unions will not  get\r\n\r\nsuch  support,  and  so the P.A.P. will  have  to\r\n\r\nresort to governmental interference with the  true\r\n\r\nunions  of  the workers in order to  foster  their\r\n\r\nP.A.P.-dominated   unions.  Such  P.A.P.-dominated\r\n\r\nunions  as  the  N.T.U.C. can  never  find  their\r\n\r\nexistence  in  true  trade unionism,  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.-controlled  unions  such  as  the  N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nexist only for the interest of the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists.  They  exist  only  for  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  a  few leaders who  work  for  their\r\n\r\nselfish  interests, but against the  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers in general. They will sell  away  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers for their own sake.  They\r\n\r\nare anti-labour, they are anti-worker; and that is\r\n\r\nwhy  they  are being discarded by the  workers  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.  Such a situation is inevitable,  because\r\n\r\ntrue  trade unionism will have the support of  all\r\n\r\nthe working class and will flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven big unions in Singapore have been banned.\r\n\r\nThe  anti-worker  elements, the  traitors  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   try  to  take  over  control   of   the\r\n\r\nmembership  of the banned unions by  absorbing  it\r\n\r\ninto the N.T.U.C., but their hopes have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshattered to pieces, because the majority  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  defunct  unions  do  not   allow\r\n\r\nthemselves to fall into their trap. They have made\r\n\r\na  wise  choice by joining unions which can  truly\r\n\r\nrepresent their interests. That is why the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis now trying its very best to take action against\r\n\r\nthese  unions  which have absorbed and  which  are\r\n\r\nabsorbing the members from the banned unions,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  Commercial  and  Factory   Workers\r\n\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is now contemplating the introduction\r\n\r\nof  a  new  Labour Ordinance to enable the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  cancel  the registration  of  those\r\n\r\nunions which truly represent the interests of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. The introduction of the proposed Bill  on\r\n\r\nlabour  has a lot of political motivation  in  it,\r\n\r\nand  this motivation aims at depriving the workers\r\n\r\nof  their  basic  rights. It has this  undesirable\r\n\r\nelement of taking away the right of the workers to\r\n\r\nask for betterment of their working conditions. It\r\n\r\nalso  has  the  undesirable factor  of  trying  to\r\n\r\nprevent the workers from leading a decent life  by\r\n\r\ntheir  strength and unity. That is why the workers\r\n\r\nin  general are very dissatisfied with the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnowadays.  Whether  you are  a  colonialist  or  a\r\n\r\nreactionary element of the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nor  whether you are a P.A.P. divisionist, you  all\r\n\r\naim  at  high  pressure to  be  exerted  over  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  You  are all trying to  resort  to  very\r\n\r\nundemocratic   means   and  unreasonable   tactics\r\n\r\nagainst the workers. To achieve all this you  make\r\n\r\nuse  of this popular education campaign to try and\r\n\r\nmonopolise the trade union world. But in spite  of\r\n\r\nall that they are doing, they will not succeed  in\r\n\r\ngetting  control of the true trade unions, because\r\n\r\ntheir  motivation  is  undesirable  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance.  An idea of this undesirable  motivation\r\n\r\ncan  be  seen from a speech broadcast  over  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore by Dr Goh Keng Swee. In this speech Dr\r\n\r\nGoh  believes that only his kind of trade unionism\r\n\r\nwill be able to promote industrialisation, whereas\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unionism  that is  in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, such as the trade unionism encouraged and\r\n\r\naccepted by the seven banned unions, according  to\r\n\r\nDr Goh, is not conducive to industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Yet in spite of what he says, these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions  that  are  truly  representative  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers'  interests have popular support from  the\r\n\r\nworking  class, because they seek to  improve  the\r\n\r\nlot of the workers in general. The broad masses of\r\n\r\nthe  working class cannot compare their  wages  to\r\n\r\nthe  salaries  of the Ministers. The  workers  are\r\n\r\nliving in misery, unlike the Ministers who live in\r\n\r\nbig  houses.  So to improve their  lot  to  get  a\r\n\r\ndecent living they have to take certain actions to\r\n\r\nclaim  for better working conditions. Our  workers\r\n\r\nin Singapore are not, as is said by our Ministers,\r\n\r\nenjoying a very high standard of living. If you go\r\n\r\nround  Singapore and see for yourselves, you  will\r\n\r\nrealise what misery our Singapore workers are  in.\r\n\r\nIn  his  speech over the Radio, Dr Goh Keng  Swee\r\n\r\nsays  that some foreign investors are hesitant  in\r\n\r\ncoming forward to Singapore to invest because they\r\n\r\nare  afraid of the industrial unrest in Singapore.\r\n\r\nToday, the P.A.P. has taken a lot of capital  away\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore  to the North Borneo  and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nterritories. Yet they have the cheek to turn round\r\n\r\nand say that it is because foreign capitalists are\r\n\r\nhesitant  in  coming  forward  to  Singapore  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  not  been able to  get  sufficient\r\n\r\ncapital for industrialisation purposes. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  these  economic  experts  will  do  to\r\n\r\nprotect  our  local  capitalists  against  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition.  In  fact,  our  so-called   economic\r\n\r\nexperts  are  more  interested in  protecting  the\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists  and investors  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthan  our  own  local  small  capitalists.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore very clear that the P.A.P. in trying  to\r\n\r\neducate   the  working  class  perhaps   aims   at\r\n\r\ndepriving the workers of their right to strike and\r\n\r\nto  ask  for better working conditions.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, they are trying to deceive the workers into\r\n\r\nbelieving that by keeping quiet they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  have  a better lot in future, that it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for the workers to go on strike  to  get\r\n\r\nbetter  terms of service. This perhaps is the  aim\r\n\r\nof  the  so-called education policy of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThis  measure  and the steps contemplated  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. now will in the next five years bring  the\r\n\r\nworkers  into greater misery and go a step further\r\n\r\nto fatten the pockets of the foreign investors. We\r\n\r\ncan say that but for these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures   and  proposed  policies  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  will be able to lead a decent  life,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  the  P.A.P. is  trying  to  appease  the\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists, the lot of  the  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will not be improved; in fact  it  will\r\n\r\ndeteriorate as more money is being taken  away  by\r\n\r\nthe  foreign capitalists and more and more workers\r\n\r\nwill  have  to work under worse working conditions\r\n\r\nwith less wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the policy of the P.A.P. in regard to\r\n\r\nforeign  capitalists and investors  in  Singapore?\r\n\r\nThey  are  more  interested  in  protecting  their\r\n\r\nvested interests. They do not care so much for the\r\n\r\nworkers  in Singapore. Neither do they  care  very\r\n\r\nmuch   for  the  local  capitalists  and  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists. What they are interested in now is to\r\n\r\nget as many foreign capitalists and investors into\r\n\r\nSingapore as possible. They think that by so doing\r\n\r\nthey will be able to bring about prosperity in our\r\n\r\ncountry.  But  I  will  now  tell  them  that  the\r\n\r\nprosperity that they are going to bring about will\r\n\r\nnot  be enjoyed by the workers in general but will\r\n\r\nbe  monopolised  by  the foreign  capitalists  and\r\n\r\ninvestors. It is fantastic for the P.A.P. to think\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  able to educate  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into obedient servants. Their so-called\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders  are  actually  aristocratic\r\n\r\npeople.   Their  talk  of  collective  bargaining,\r\n\r\nadministrative training and improvement  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  is  all  a  bluff. They  are  trying  to\r\n\r\ndeceive the workers into believing that by working\r\n\r\nobediently   for  their  capitalist  and   foreign\r\n\r\nmasters,  the workers will have a better  life  in\r\n\r\nfuture. The anti-worker elements such as Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair  are  trying to ride over the  heads  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   They  are  not  able  to  protect   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are actually working for the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  ruling class and for their own selfish  ends.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  they  trying  to  do  now?  By  way  of\r\n\r\neducating   the  workers,  they  are   trying   to\r\n\r\ninculcate ideas into the workers, that by  keeping\r\n\r\nquiet they will have their lot improved. The  true\r\n\r\ncolours  of these anti-labour elements  have  been\r\n\r\nseen clearly by the workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  general.  Who have assaulted  the  workers  on\r\n\r\nstrike?  Who have sold away the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers? Who have taken the leaders of the workers\r\n\r\nto prison? And who are actually enjoying life now?\r\n\r\nThe broad mass of the working class knows too well\r\n\r\nsuch  things.  The  so-called educating-the-worker\r\n\r\npolicy and the new legislation to be introduced in\r\n\r\nthe labour field, are all the steps taken in order\r\n\r\nto   safeguard  the  interests  of   the   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  and  foreign  capitalists.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders are trying to extract the sweat and labour\r\n\r\nof  the  workers  of  Singapore  to  please  their\r\n\r\nforeign friends and capitalists. In fact, the high\r\n\r\nstandard of living our Ministers are enjoying  now\r\n\r\nhas   been  the  result  of  exploitation  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers. The people in general are living in great\r\n\r\nmisery.  Their standard of living is lowering  and\r\n\r\ntheir  lot  will become worse and worse.  The  so-called  prosperity, as claimed by the  P.A.P.,  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is only a myth. Malaysia, as imposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  reactionary elements and the P.A.P., has  not\r\n\r\nbrought  happiness to the people. Instead  it  has\r\n\r\nbrought  misery. The working class has to  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir  belts.  This  is what  the  P.A.P. call  a\r\n\r\nprosperous Malaysia - asking the people to  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir belts. How can the PAP, convince the workers\r\n\r\nby  their radio broadcast? How can they make empty\r\n\r\npromises to the workers by painting a very glowing\r\n\r\npicture  of the future? By trying to push  forward\r\n\r\ntheir  education campaign? They will only want  to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people. The workers themselves realise\r\n\r\nthat.  In  order  to change their lot,  they  must\r\n\r\nencourage   the  local  capitalists   to   promote\r\n\r\nindustries and commerce. All these were  mentioned\r\n\r\nby Dr Goh Keng Swee during the 1959 election. But\r\n\r\ntoday,  what they safeguard are not the  interests\r\n\r\nof  the local capitalists and the interests of the\r\n\r\nworkers. They are not interested in protecting  on\r\n\r\npromoting  local industries. What  they  are  more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with is to induce foreign investors  to\r\n\r\ncome   here.   They   say  that  without   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments we will have to suffer. This is  their\r\n\r\nlogic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour says if we do not have military bases we will be attacked by other people. No self-respecting people will allow their own country to be the military bases of a foreign power. Talking about military bases, although the expenditure on the military bases is not paid by\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the Federation, but  the  military\r\n\r\nbases  we have here are intended to safeguard  and\r\n\r\nprotect  the  mining  and  rubber  industries   in\r\n\r\nMalaya,  which  suck  the  blood  of  our  fellow-citizens,  and  they belong to the foreigners.  He\r\n\r\nsays  without these military bases 60 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  tin  mines  and  90 per cent  of  the  rubber\r\n\r\nindustries  will be nationalised  by  our  country\r\n\r\nthrough  peaceful  negotiations  between  the  two\r\n\r\nGovernments. The British military bases,  although\r\n\r\nthe  money  spent on them does not come  from  our\r\n\r\ncountry  and our people, help to maintain  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists and their interests in this area.  The\r\n\r\nBritish will not be a stupid robber. They are  too\r\n\r\nclever  for that. The Minister for Labour and  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister have been saying that the military\r\n\r\nbases  support a lot of people here. The  salaries\r\n\r\npaid  to  the workers in the military  bases  come\r\n\r\nfrom the rich rubber estates, from the revenue  of\r\n\r\nour  port  and  from the benefits of  our  foreign\r\n\r\ntrade.  Is  this  not  a classic  example  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  sucking  the blood  of  our  people?  The\r\n\r\nsalaries  received by the workers in the  military\r\n\r\nbases   do  not  come  from  the  British  people.\r\n\r\nAlthough  to some extent the troops here have  fed\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  workers,  all  peace-loving  people\r\n\r\nthroughout the world and the people in our country\r\n\r\nhave  in  turn supported the British  troops.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour can for some time deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople  through  his radio, television  and  Press\r\n\r\ntalks,  but  outside this Chamber  his  propaganda\r\n\r\nwill not stand the lest of time. How can they  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  British imperialist bases in this  area\r\n\r\nsupport  the  people in this area? This  plausible\r\n\r\nargument  put  forward by the  Minister  will  not\r\n\r\ndeceive  the  people  any longer  and  it  is  not\r\n\r\nwithout   reason  that  they  put   forward   this\r\n\r\nargument.  It  is  put forward to deceive  certain\r\n\r\nsections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the people who are ignorant of whether who are\r\n\r\nsupporting whom, whether the British bases support\r\n\r\nour  people or we, the people, support the British\r\n\r\nbases  here. They say that to abolish the military\r\n\r\nbases  here will bring unemployment to our workers\r\n\r\nhere. In fact, with our rich natural resources, we\r\n\r\ncan  very  well  support the workers  who  are  at\r\n\r\npresent  working in the military bases.  Once  the\r\n\r\nBritish  foreign  bases no more  exist  here,  the\r\n\r\nworkers working in the bases will be looked  after\r\n\r\nby  our nation and will receive their proper  due.\r\n\r\nOnly  the  reactionary elements and the  Ministers\r\n\r\nwill  dare to say that without military bases  our\r\n\r\nworkers  will  be  jobless  because  we  have  our\r\n\r\nnational  wealth  to  support these  workers.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  will  not  look   after   the\r\n\r\nunemployed   people.  We  strongly   condemn   the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of foreign bases and we  condemn  the\r\n\r\nBritish/Malayan   Defence   Agreement   from   the\r\n\r\nstandpoint of safeguarding the workers. We  expose\r\n\r\nthe  specious arguments put forward by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters.  Once they know the true  picture,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  will  not be misled or  deceived  by  the\r\n\r\nargument  that without military bases our  workers\r\n\r\ncannot get any jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those anti-worker classes on the question of\r\n\r\nsolving  the  unemployment problem of the  workers\r\n\r\nare  helpless. The only thing they can  do  is  to\r\n\r\ndestroy   the   workers'   organisation,   disrupt\r\n\r\npeaceful  living and interfere with the legitimate\r\n\r\nright of the workers. These people are helping the\r\n\r\nBritish  masters  to  carry  out  suppression  and\r\n\r\nexploitation. In the coming days if  their  policy\r\n\r\nfails  and  if  the  lot of  the  workers  is  not\r\n\r\nimproved,  then  they  will be  discarded  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers. What I have said above is on the intended\r\n\r\ntrade union legislation and the specious education\r\n\r\nof the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about the Labour Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil. As long ago as the beginning of this year\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  Minister for Finance  mentioned  it\r\n\r\nduring  his radio broadcast. In the speech of  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara this session, there is only\r\n\r\na  short passage about it. The speech broadcast by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance was more  clear  about\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  order not to let this point pass away, I  find\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to  repeat what  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, Dr Goh Keng Swee, said on it during  his\r\n\r\nbroadcast. He said his view and impression of  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  supported by the workers  was  that\r\n\r\nthey   supported  only  the  interest  of  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of  the people. They were interested  in\r\n\r\nasking  for  better living conditions  and  better\r\n\r\nwages  only for a section of the workers in  these\r\n\r\ntrade  unions.  That is why Dr Goh suggested  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Labour Advisory Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as an organisation a trade union must\r\n\r\nlook  after the interests of its members. It  goes\r\n\r\nwithout  saying  and  it is justified.  And  as  a\r\n\r\nnational  organisation, of course,  it  will  also\r\n\r\nlook  after the members who belong to it. How  can\r\n\r\nyou  ask  the organisation not to seek to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  lot and the working conditions of the members\r\n\r\nbelonging to it? Of course, people like the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  are  not satisfied, although  they  are\r\n\r\nusing  their  positions in the  State  to  protect\r\n\r\ntheir  interest. They are not contented with this.\r\n\r\nThey  also  want  to make use of the  trade  union\r\n\r\norganisation to protect their own interest. As  to\r\n\r\nhow  to protect foreign capitalists, Dr Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee   suggested  setting  up  a  Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil so that the workers can be recruited  over\r\n\r\nto  their side and not to raise demands for better\r\n\r\nworking  conditions. Dr Goh was not in  agreement\r\n\r\nthat  the  claims by the workers were  for  better\r\n\r\nworking conditions and better living standards. He\r\n\r\nsaid  his view was that the unions making  demands\r\n\r\non  behalf of the workers should be concerned with\r\n\r\nthe claims to benefit foreign capitalists instead.\r\n\r\nYou can see clearly what has been mentioned in the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech, that the Labour Advisory  Council,\r\n\r\nconsisting    of   Labour   Ministry    officials,\r\n\r\nmanagement   representatives   and   trade   union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  is not really  directed  towards\r\n\r\nnor can it achieve the aim of improving the lot of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  Instead they  want  to  freeze  all\r\n\r\nimprovement of working conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today an important question is: \"What kind of\r\n\r\npeople  are  trade  union representatives?\"  Trade\r\n\r\nunions which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  truly supported by the workers they  construe\r\n\r\nto  be Communist controlled.

And   those  anti-worker  trade   unions\r\n\r\ncontrolled by anti-worker personnel as Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nwho   serve   only   the  interests   of   foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists they construe to be true trade unions.\r\n\r\nWe  doubt very much whether people like Devan Nair\r\n\r\ncan truly represent the interest of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in this Chamber two years ago we\r\n\r\nheard   the  Chairman  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nrepeating  the  same old record and  yet  now  the\r\n\r\nnewly  elected  Member is doing  the  same  thing,\r\n\r\ncriticising all this P.A.P. labour --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

With reference to the first part  of  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  representatives, I have  expressed  my\r\n\r\ndoubts  about  it when I talked about  the  labour\r\n\r\npolicy.  I have doubts as to the acceptability  of\r\n\r\nthis representation by the workers. To the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nit  is those trade unions which support the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  can  be considered as genuine and legitimate\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. To the P.A.P., those  trade  unions\r\n\r\nregistered under the Trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnions Ordinance, as provided for by the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Trade Unions, can truly represent the workers.\r\n\r\nAnd  today the Ministry of Labour has proposed  to\r\n\r\nset  up  a  Labour Advisory Council! Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nhave  grave doubts as to the intention  of  having\r\n\r\nthem  as one of the three representatives  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  - whether  the  so-called  representatives\r\n\r\nwould be recruited from the discredited unions who\r\n\r\nare  stooges  of the P.A.P. Perhaps a member  from\r\n\r\nthe trade unions fostered by the P.A.P. - which are\r\n\r\nstooges of the P.A.P. - will be nominated  as  one\r\n\r\nof the representatives in this Council. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave not only arrested a few people, but they have\r\n\r\nalso arrested many of the trade union leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now analyse further the composition of the\r\n\r\nLabour  Advisory  Council with  reference  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour officials. In  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  propaganda  and  what  they  have   been\r\n\r\nsaying,  namely, that the officials of the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  are to look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   the   question  whether  these   Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  officials  represented  on  the   Labour\r\n\r\nAdvisory Council can truly speak on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  raises  a  grave  doubt.  I  have  doubts\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Labour  Ministry  officials  to   he\r\n\r\nrepresented  on the Labour Advisory Council  which\r\n\r\nis going to be set up can look after the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  workers. If they can do so,  they  should\r\n\r\nhave concrete evidence to prove it.

I have been talking  about  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the Labour  Ministry.  This\r\n\r\npoint  is contained in the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  and  I have  been  confining  my\r\n\r\nspeech to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  I  am  of  the  opinion  that   the\r\n\r\nofficials of the Labour Ministry cannot  speak  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  workers in these coming  days  or\r\n\r\nyears.  I  have concrete facts to substantiate  my\r\n\r\ndoubts. For instance, in the past, during a strike\r\n\r\nat  Lorong 3, Geylang, the strikers were beaten up\r\n\r\nby  the police and troops were sent down from  the\r\n\r\nCentral   Government.  But  the  Labour   Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials were indifferent to this. What was their\r\n\r\nattitude then? What has been the attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Ministry  officials on such  questions  as\r\n\r\nthis?  Can  they look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  when  they  sit in  the  Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil? The general mass of the people have grave\r\n\r\ndoubts about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will touch on the third category of the\r\n\r\ntripartite representatives in the Labour  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil, namely the management representatives. We\r\n\r\nsay    that   there   are   two   categories    of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives;  one  representing  the   foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists   and   the  other  representing   our\r\n\r\nnational employers. If the national employers  can\r\n\r\nlook  after the interests of the workers, it would\r\n\r\nbe  something very wonderful. But the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  said that the P.A.P. intend  to  get\r\n\r\nforeign capitalists to invest here. In addition to\r\n\r\nthe  doubt  as  to the intention of  the  national\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and their ability to look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the workers, we have further  doubts\r\n\r\nas   to   the  good  intentions  of  the   foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  Of  course,  there  should  be  true\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of workers in the  Council  before\r\n\r\nthere  can  be any genuine representation  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   If   there  is  no   genuine   workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentation  on  the  Council,  we  have  grave\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to the intention of the representation\r\n\r\nof  the employers on the Council, and the value of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Advisory  Council.  This  policy   of\r\n\r\nbrutality  and barbarism against the workers  does\r\n\r\nnot  meet  with  the needs of the  whole  economic\r\n\r\nrequirements of local conditions. Yet  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  not satisfied with it. It goes further. It  is\r\n\r\ndealing  with the Labour Ministry. From  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the Labour Research Unit could not bring  any\r\n\r\nbenefit  to the workers, we can imagine  that  the\r\n\r\nLabour Advisory Council will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe same as the past Labour Research Unit --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nRubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Of  course, the foreign  capitalists\r\n\r\nwill  thank the P.A.P. for their so-called  labour\r\n\r\npolicy. They are trying to make use of this Labour\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council to tie the hands of the  workers\r\n\r\nwho  want  to fight for their interests and  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  wages.  It is indeed a great misfortune  to\r\n\r\nthe workers if this Labour Advisory Council is set\r\n\r\nup according to the P.A.P.'s plan. As long as some\r\n\r\nof the trade unions are manipulated by the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthere will be no industrial peace. In the days  to\r\n\r\ncome  the P.A.P. will inevitably link up with  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government to carry out their anti-worker\r\n\r\nmeasures and to brutally and savagely suppress the\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noted that in the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech it is very obvious that not  only\r\n\r\ndoes  the P.A.P. Government ignore the true  trade\r\n\r\nunions, but it also goes out of its way to get the\r\n\r\nco-operation  of the management and  employers  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  the workers. And those true  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe   workers  are  branded  by  the   P.A.P. as\r\n\r\nCommunists  in an attempt to suppress their  trade\r\n\r\nunions. They are also trying to make use of  their\r\n\r\nP.A.P.-controlled  unions  to  foster  their   own\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour policy contained in the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara's speech will not bring benefit  to\r\n\r\nthe workers. Neither will it bring any prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. and the reactionary Government in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  must realise that however  brutal  and\r\n\r\nsavage  their  suppression, the workers  will  not\r\n\r\nsubmit to them.

In order to  enable\r\n\r\nMembers of this House to know our ideas better, we\r\n\r\nhave to read from our prepared speeches. Well,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  for  this idle talk. Let us go back  to  the\r\n\r\ntopic under discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question that I am raising now is on\r\n\r\nlabour autonomy. To what extent is labour autonomy\r\n\r\ngranted  to  the people of Singapore in substance,\r\n\r\nor  does labour autonomy only exist in its titular\r\n\r\nvalue - just in name? We urge the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nto keep its promise in maintaining labour autonomy\r\n\r\nin Singapore and in meeting the Opposition in open\r\n\r\nargument  rather than in resorting  to  the  high-pressure  tactics  of the Central  Government.  We\r\n\r\nurge  the  P.A.P. Government to resist  the  high-pressure tactics of the Central Government because\r\n\r\nsuch  tactics are against the declared  policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in fighting in the open  argument.\r\n\r\nIt  is  inconsistent with the open argument policy\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  We  want the  P.A.P. to  declare\r\n\r\nwhether  it  still supports the open  argument  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it  has gone over to support the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  for its high-pressure and  high-handed\r\n\r\ntactics.  We  also want the P.A.P. to  defend  the\r\n\r\nlabour  autonomy which it has been boasting  about\r\n\r\nso  much.  As a matter of fact, the livelihood  of\r\n\r\nthe   workers   in  Singapore  has  been   grossly\r\n\r\ninterfered  with, and unnecessarily  too,  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. And that  was  precisely  the\r\n\r\nfear that we had before the formation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWithout  political protection,  there  can  be  no\r\n\r\nexistence of any labour autonomy. If you have no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  safeguards, you cannot talk  of  labour\r\n\r\nautonomy. If the P.A.P. still persist in believing\r\n\r\nthat   there   can  be  labour  autonomy   without\r\n\r\npolitical safeguards, then how are they  going  to\r\n\r\nexplain  away the fact that the workers have  been\r\n\r\ninterfered  with  by  the Federation  police?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  the Federation send troops and  police  to\r\n\r\nassault  the  workers  in  Singapore?  The   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said time and again that he does  not\r\n\r\nendorse  the  action  of the  police  against  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   But   only  recently   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken police and military  action\r\n\r\nagainst  the workers on strike. Now, what  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the P.A.P. to this matter?  Are  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. really  interested  in  safeguarding   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the workers? Or are they going  back\r\n\r\non  the  word of the Prime Minister? He  has  said\r\n\r\n- and  he  is known to have said - that he does  not\r\n\r\nendorse  police  and military action  against  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  but  that they must  be  dealt  with  by\r\n\r\npeaceful  means. There has been no riot occasioned\r\n\r\nby any strike of the workers and there has been no\r\n\r\nnecessity  for the Federation police to come  down\r\n\r\nto Singapore to interfere with the strikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Singapore have seen for themselves\r\n\r\nthat  well-trained police personnel have been used\r\n\r\nby  the Central Government against the workers  on\r\n\r\nstrike  in  Singapore. In any constitution,  there\r\n\r\nshould be no provision to-deprive the right of the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  strike.  Even the  Government  itself\r\n\r\nrecognises the right of the workers to strike.  So\r\n\r\nbefore  such  a  right  is declared  illegal,  the\r\n\r\nworkers  themselves can take part in a  legitimate\r\n\r\nstrike and there should be no police or government\r\n\r\ninterference. The strike is a weapon by which  the\r\n\r\nworkers   can   seek  to  improve  their   working\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my view of the labour policy of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nthought  we had already got rid of the filibuster,\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  but we  have  got  so  many\r\n\r\nfilibusters here today.

But then if  all\r\n\r\nof  us of the ruling Party did this, this Assembly\r\n\r\nwould  indeed  become a very poor place,  and  the\r\n\r\npublic   would   be  denied  the  opportunity   of\r\n\r\nwitnessing their representatives in action.  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring, of course, to the poor Opposition Party\r\n\r\nin  this  House. As we all know, those of  us  who\r\n\r\ncherish  democracy  appreciate  an  effective  and\r\n\r\nintelligent Opposition. Mr Speaker, Sir, it  does\r\n\r\nappear  to  me  that  such a  desirable  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs is not at the moment present with  us.  As\r\n\r\nthe   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  has  stated   very\r\n\r\naccurately, our life is now interwoven  with  that\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  and  if  we  confine  ourselves  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   we   cannot  be   effective,   however\r\n\r\nsuccessful we may be in the Malaysian scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
