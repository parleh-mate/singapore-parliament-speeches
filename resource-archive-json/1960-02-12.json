In the space of less than one month,  and\r\n\r\non  the very day that the Bill was to come up  for\r\n\r\ndebate  on  its  Second Reading, the  Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge  found it necessary to put into  our  hands\r\n\r\nseven pages of 50 amendments. Out of a short  Bill\r\n\r\nof  37  pages,  50  amendments had  to  be  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough.  Sir,  I  use the term \"rushed  through\",\r\n\r\nbecause the amendments were given to us just a few\r\n\r\nhours on the very day of the sitting at which  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Bill was to take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the amendments been in the nature of\r\n\r\ncorrections,    or   alterations    or    sentence\r\n\r\nconstruction,  or printing errors, or  even  minor\r\n\r\noversights,  then  it would have  been  of  little\r\n\r\nconsequence.  But  as it is, Sir,  the  amendments\r\n\r\nconsist  of  very  important changes.  In  several\r\n\r\ncases,  the most vital principles of the Bill  are\r\n\r\nto be negatived by the amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Opposition Bench praised the Bill\r\n\r\nat  the  last sitting because there were signs  of\r\n\r\ngenuine effort to promote industrial peace, giving\r\n\r\n(as  was stated by the Hon. the Prime Minister)  a\r\n\r\nfair  deal  to the workers and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\ncreating   conditions  conducive   to   industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion.

I  am  giving\r\n\r\nreasons  why it should be postponed, and although\r\n\r\nit  might seem irrelevant now, I hope, when I tie\r\n\r\nup  my  reasons, to show that they  are  relevant\r\n\r\nand  why  I  think the Committee stage should  be\r\n\r\npostponed. We thought that the Bill was  designed\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the reoccurrence of the mistakes  of\r\n\r\nthe  past.

The notices of amendments\r\n\r\nwere,  in fact, received in the Clerk's Office  on\r\n\r\nthe  8th of February. Admittedly, it did take some\r\n\r\ntime for the Clerk to go through the amendments to\r\n\r\nput them into a shape acceptable to me, and it was\r\n\r\nnot  until  the  morning  of  10th  February  that\r\n\r\nMembers  received their copies of the  amendments.\r\n\r\nSo,  in  so  far as the Government are  concerned,\r\n\r\nthey were in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the Chairman do report\r\n\r\nprogress and ask leave to sit again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall later  be\r\n\r\nmoving  amendments which will clearly show to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Front Bench that the amendments do  not\r\n\r\nin  any way affect the main structure of the Bill.\r\n\r\nThey  are in respect of points of detail. And when\r\n\r\nI  do  so, I think I will be able to promote peace\r\n\r\nbetween the Opposition and ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I received my copy of the amendments\r\n\r\nof  the Minister for Labour and Law when I arrived\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly about ten minutes  before  2.30\r\n\r\np.m.  I therefore had no time to become acquainted\r\n\r\nwith   the  proposals  outlined  in  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments. I do not say, Sir, that the Government\r\n\r\nwere  out  of time in submitting their amendments.\r\n\r\nBut I do say that had the Opposition been aware of\r\n\r\nsuch  amendments  that were  being  proposed,  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of the Opposition on the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  might  have  been  of  a  different\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that there was no useful purpose in referring this Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion of principles was not involved. But I  do\r\n\r\nrespectfully  submit,  Sir,  that  the  amendments\r\n\r\nproposed by the Minister for Labour and Law  go  a\r\n\r\nlong way to upset the balance that was aimed at in\r\n\r\nthe Bill - the balance of conflicting forces - so that\r\n\r\nthere  could be industrial peace. I do again  say,\r\n\r\nSir,   that,  because  of  the  very  nature   and\r\n\r\ncharacter of the Government amendments, more  time\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  to the Opposition  and  to  the\r\n\r\npublic to become aware of their implications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has  just complained  that  he  had  no\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   looking   at   the   Government\r\n\r\namendments   until   2.30  this   afternoon,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is prepared to postpone the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage to after item No. 5 on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nif I had been able to read the proposed Government\r\n\r\namendments  before I made my speech on the  Second\r\n\r\nReading, I would most certainly not have spoken in\r\n\r\nthe  tenor in which I, in fact, had done. When  we\r\n\r\nmet  here  the day before yesterday, I thought  it\r\n\r\nwas  an excellent Bill, a courageous Bill, because\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was attempting to  solve  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem, which is to hold  the  balance\r\n\r\nevenly  between  employees and  employers  in  the\r\n\r\noverall interest of the State. Sir, after  I  have\r\n\r\nhad  the  opportunity to look  at  the  Government\r\n\r\namendments and to realise their implications, I am\r\n\r\nnow   satisfied   that  the  balance   which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had so strenuously sought to  preserve\r\n\r\nin the original Bill has been whittled down to the\r\n\r\nextent where one of the parties to a dispute would\r\n\r\nhave lost confidence in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the primary aim and objective of\r\n\r\nthis Bill is to secure industrial peace, it is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  imperative that both sides to the  dispute\r\n\r\nshould  be  satisfied  that  it  is  a  fair   and\r\n\r\nimpartial  Bill. At the moment, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nas  the amendments stand, the Opposition feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Bill is weighted with the amendments  on  one\r\n\r\nside, and the balance is not held equally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that he has received representations from both employers and employees,\r\n\r\nand  as  a result of those representations he  has\r\n\r\nframed  these  amendments. If I may  say  so  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  the  Minister, these amendments  have\r\n\r\nbeen  filed  at the instance and at the suggestion\r\n\r\nof   employees.  May  I  ask  him  whether   these\r\n\r\namendments have been put to the employers to  find\r\n\r\nout  what  their views are on them? I  venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the Minister that if these amendments\r\n\r\nhad been put to the employers, they might not have\r\n\r\nreadily  accepted the Bill in its amended form.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  beg  of  the  Minister  to  defer   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  Stage, Sir, so that the  employers  and\r\n\r\nothers  who  are interested in the Bill  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven   adequate   opportunity  to   examine   the\r\n\r\namendments and to see what their effect will be on\r\n\r\nindustrial peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, at the last\r\n\r\nsitting  of  the  Assembly, every  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  who spoke said that this Bill  was  very\r\n\r\nimportant and vital to the interest of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Therefore, I do not wish to be left\r\n\r\nbehind  in expressing my dissatisfaction with  the\r\n\r\nmethod  by  which this Bill is going to be  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough without first giving an opportunity to the\r\n\r\nOpposition to review it thoroughly, because it has\r\n\r\nbeen   found,  as  expressed  earlier,  that   the\r\n\r\namendments  just tabled by the Government  clearly\r\n\r\nshow that they are contrary to what the Government\r\n\r\nclaims  them to be, that is, the Bill  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of all concerned. We have just been made\r\n\r\nto  understand that the Government has considered\r\n\r\nthese  amendments after receiving  the  views  and\r\n\r\nrepresentations  of  many  trade  unions  who  had\r\n\r\noffered  their  views. Hence  the  Government  has\r\n\r\ntabled   many  amendments.  It  cannot  be   said,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  only trade unions were  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to express their views  on  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich affects industrial relations. Similarly, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are not satisfied, as  they  were  not\r\n\r\ngiven  an opportunity. We must not forget that  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly we are not representing the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  or  employers but we are here responsible\r\n\r\nfor the enacting of Bills which give protection to\r\n\r\nall  sections  of the community in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nnot  merely  a certain section. Hence  it  follows\r\n\r\nthat the views expressed by the Opposition for the\r\n\r\npostponement  of  this  Bill  should  receive  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the Minister, because  we,  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, will also be held responsible for  the\r\n\r\nenactment  of any Bills that are put  before  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  remember  the Prime  Minister  saying  on\r\n\r\nWednesday that there was no principle on which the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could give way.

As a result of the discussions that I\r\n\r\nhave  had  both  with the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nunions  and  the  employers, the  Government  has,\r\n\r\nafter  taking  into account both  representations,\r\n\r\ndrafted the amendments which we hope to move  this\r\n\r\nafternoon,  so that it has' not been  a  one-sided\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre,  as  the  Opposition  Front  Bench  are\r\n\r\ntrying to suggest now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since they require a little\r\n\r\nmore time, I do not mind giving them a little more\r\n\r\ntime.

The Opposition  quite\r\n\r\nfrankly  informed  the House  that  they  were  in\r\n\r\ncomplete agreement with the principle involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. As the Second Reading is concerned with\r\n\r\nthe debate on the principle of the Bill, there was\r\n\r\nnothing   that   the  Opposition  could   say   in\r\n\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was the Hon. the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister who said that this was  the  first\r\n\r\nattempt made by the Legislature to bring the  rule\r\n\r\nof  law into industrial relations where previously\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  the jungle had prevailed.  That,  I\r\n\r\nthought,  was an admirable sentiment and something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very necessary if confidence is  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished  which will attract  capital  to  this\r\n\r\nplace  and  keep  it  here. If  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the rule of law where the rule  of  the\r\n\r\njungle had prevailed, then the Court must be  able\r\n\r\nto  enforce  its awards both against the  employee\r\n\r\nand  the  employer. That is the rule of law  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  Mr  Speaker.  The  rule  of  the\r\n\r\njungle,  as  we all understand it,  is  where  the\r\n\r\nsuperior  survives and the inferior is  destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe  want  the  rule of law. But when we  read  the\r\n\r\namendments,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we  find  that  the\r\n\r\nawards  can be enforced against the employer,  but\r\n\r\nit seems that the employees are not so bound. That\r\n\r\nis  our  reading  of the amendments.  If  that  is\r\n\r\ncorrect,  then there are no sanctions attached  to\r\n\r\nthe failure on the part of the employee to observe\r\n\r\nan award. If that is the correct interpretation of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments, Mr Speaker, where  then  is  the\r\n\r\nrule of law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  various  Members   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition have based their request for a delay in\r\n\r\nconsidering  this Bill in Committee on  the  point\r\n\r\nthat  the  amendments proposed by  the  Government\r\n\r\nhave  been such as to radically change the  nature\r\n\r\nof  the Bill.

The  Bill  in  its original  and  in  its\r\n\r\namended   forms   sets  out  the  procedures   and\r\n\r\nregulations  whereby disputes between  unions  and\r\n\r\nemployers  can  be settled in an orderly  fashion.\r\n\r\nThat was the aim of the original Bill and that  is\r\n\r\nthe  aim  of the Bill as amended. Again, there  is\r\n\r\nthe claim that the amendments have been so drastic\r\n\r\nas  to  alter  the balance between  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees - a  balance which the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\napproved  in  respect of the  original  Bill,  but\r\n\r\nwhich   they   disapprove  in   respect   of   the\r\n\r\namendments,  presumably because they suspect  that\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  have  given  concessions  to  the\r\n\r\nunions  but not to employers. This apparently  has\r\n\r\ncaused  considerable dismay among Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  who  everyone knows  represent  vested\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put both our feet firmly on the ground\r\n\r\nand  let  us  not indulge in flights of  fantasies\r\n\r\nabout  the effect of these amendments in reverting\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations to the rule of  the  jungle.\r\n\r\nMay  I ask the Opposition to remember always  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government acts with decision? It  has\r\n\r\nnot  been hasty in drafting the Bill. It has given\r\n\r\ndue   consideration  to  proposals  and   counter-\r\n\r\nproposals  from  the parties affected.  But  there\r\n\r\nmust  be some finality in these things, and if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  act in the manner which Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition want us to, that is, to preserve a fine\r\n\r\nbalance between the groups concerned, we would  go\r\n\r\non  balancing for the next five years. Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition may well be reminded of the  story\r\n\r\nof  Columbus when he wanted to balance an egg.

I think the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has asked me to repeat what I\r\n\r\nsaid  when I moved the Second Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\nMy  point is that if he had paid attention to what\r\n\r\nI  was saying, then there would have been no  need\r\n\r\nfor  his asking me to repeat what I then said.  In\r\n\r\norder that he may he informed, I shall now proceed\r\n\r\nto  restate what I then said on the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof the Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... we have also decided to leave the Services and\r\n\r\ntheir  employees  out of the  provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  This  is because our State is  fully  self-governing  in  internal  affairs  but  is  not   a\r\n\r\nsovereign  State as far as external relations  and\r\n\r\ninternal security are concerned. For that  reason,\r\n\r\nwe   are   in  no  position  to  pass  any   local\r\n\r\nlegislation  binding on Her Majesty's  Government.\r\n\r\nThat  being  so,  we consider  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nadvisable  to leave it to the Services  and  their\r\n\r\nemployees to decide whether they would freely wish\r\n\r\nto  avail  themselves  of the  machinery  we  have\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  Bill  for  the  settlement  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  disputes, and it would be up  to  them\r\n\r\ntherefore to decide whether they would freely come\r\n\r\nin or keep out altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also said then, Mr Speaker:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In this connection, I have been advised by the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  Commissioner in  Singapore,  with\r\n\r\nwhom  both  the  Prime Minister  and  I  have  had\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  that the United Kingdom  departments\r\n\r\nare not opposed in principle to the objects of the\r\n\r\nBill,  since  indeed arbitration courts  have  for\r\n\r\nlong  been  a  normal  feature  of  civil  service\r\n\r\nnegotiating machinery in the United Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI also informed the House:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have also been informed by the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nCommission   here   that   the   United    Kingdom\r\n\r\ndepartments  could  not,  however,  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nBill's  application without modification to  cover\r\n\r\ncertain  aspects  which  are  governed  by  United\r\n\r\nKingdom statute or practice and are not within the\r\n\r\ndirect  competence of the United  Kingdom  Service\r\n\r\ndepartments functioning in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I also expressed the hope that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...it will be possible in the near future for the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Service departments  10  reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with their employees on the application\r\n\r\nof the Bill on such terms as may be agreed between\r\n\r\nthem,  and, if such agreement is not possible,  to\r\n\r\nsettle their problems by other amicable means.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did listen\r\n\r\nto  the  Hon. the Minister when he was moving  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading of the Bill. I just wanted him  to\r\n\r\nrepeat it in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Sir, that a self-governing\r\n\r\nconstitution  is much worse than the  constitution\r\n\r\nof a colony. When Singapore was a colony from 1955\r\n\r\nto  1959, yet our laws could legislate to  contain\r\n\r\nand   embrace  any  department  of  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment.   And  we  are  told  today   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment that because we are self-governing  we,\r\n\r\ntherefore, cannot do it. Yet when we were  running\r\n\r\na  colonial  government we had been challenged  by\r\n\r\nleaders of the P.A.P. as to why we did not  insist\r\n\r\nthat  employees of Service departments  should  be\r\n\r\ncovered   by   law.  Because  of  that,   we   had\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the British Government and had it\r\n\r\nincluded  in our law. It could be easily  verified\r\n\r\nif  you  look up the Labour Code and other  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation  that  a  Service  department  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government is so covered. And  today  we\r\n\r\nare told in this House that because we have a self-governing constitution we cannot do what we  could\r\n\r\ndo when we were a colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's stand is\r\n\r\nsincere  and  consistent, and  not  like  that  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government. We see the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nstanding up today accusing this Government of giving no\r\n\r\nprotection whatsoever to Service employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to state here that I had\r\n\r\nbeen  employed  in the Army and was actively  concerned\r\n\r\nwith a certain union. We are aware that if the Services\r\n\r\nor the British Government desire that Service employees\r\n\r\nbe  covered  in  this Bill, then all the provisions  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  must  be acceptable to  them.  But  in  our\r\n\r\nexperience - I  personally have had  this  experience - any\r\n\r\nlocal legislation which will benefit the Services  will\r\n\r\nbe  acceptable to them, but if any local legislation is\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  them  they  will  not  wish   to   get\r\n\r\nthemselves involved in it, and they will say that  they\r\n\r\nhave their own legislation in the United Kingdom. I can\r\n\r\nsay  frankly in front of the Member for Cairnhill  that\r\n\r\nhe himself knew that many disputes arose in the Service\r\n\r\nestablishments when I was an Assemblyman for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nand that I did bring such matters to his attention, but\r\n\r\nhe  replied  that he was in no position to settle  such\r\n\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today it seems that he is trying to make it\r\n\r\nappear   as  if  we  have  neglected  or  shirked   our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the Services employees. I think  such\r\n\r\nan  accusation is unfounded. As I have said earlier  in\r\n\r\nmy  speech, we are frank, outspoken and sincere. If the\r\n\r\nServices  departments  wish to  accept  completely  the\r\n\r\nlegislation passed by the local Government, they should\r\n\r\nwholly abide by the legislation, and not accept part of\r\n\r\nit  and reject the other. I have personally experienced\r\n\r\nthis, and I am sure the Services unions will agree with\r\n\r\nme in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, all that the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has said does not deny the fact  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  laws  of  today, Service  departments  are\r\n\r\ncovered.  If  they  could  be  covered  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance, if they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould   be   covered  in  the  Workmen's   Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  if they could be covered in any other  law,\r\n\r\nwhy  cannot they be covered in this law? It is the same\r\n\r\nlaw!  If  it  is necessary to delete it, then  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Government that they should  amend  all\r\n\r\nthe  laws  that are in existence today - to take  out  of\r\n\r\nthem  the coverage of the Services departments  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom  Government.  Sir,  there  is   enough\r\n\r\nprotection  of  Her Majesty's Government here,  because\r\n\r\nthe  employees  working  in  the  Services  departments\r\n\r\ncannot  be so declared as employees until the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has so declared. And the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara is a representative of Her Majesty in the  State\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Now, if we do not have it in there, Sir,\r\n\r\nthen  how  are we going to give protection  to  Service\r\n\r\nemployees?  I  am  not  a  lawyer.  Suppose  today  the\r\n\r\nServices  union says, \"Yes, we want to come under  this\r\n\r\nlaw\";  the Services departments say, \"Yes, we  want  to\r\n\r\ncome under this law\"; then how are they to come in when\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes  of  this  Ordinance  they  are  not\r\n\r\n\"employees\" or \"employers\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite obvious that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill had been seeing visions  and\r\n\r\ndreaming  dreams all the years when he was in politics,\r\n\r\nfrom 1948 to 1959. If he was a realist at all, he would\r\n\r\nhave  known,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that no  non-Sovereign\r\n\r\nlegislative  body  can  bind Her Majesty's  Government.\r\n\r\nThat is a well-settled constitutional point, and I need\r\n\r\nnot in any way argue it here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Services and their employees\r\n\r\nwere brought into the present Labour Ordinance, it  was\r\n\r\nby  agreement. If it is possible for them to  reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement - and I have expressed the hope that they would\r\n\r\ndo  so - it  will  be  quite easy for  us  to  amend  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to provide for their coming in. We certainly\r\n\r\nwould  be very pleased if they could agree to come  in.\r\n\r\nBut   as   I  have  pointed  out,  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nCommissioner  here has made it clear  that  they  would\r\n\r\nonly  agree  to  their employees coming in  on  certain\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd until those conditions are agreed, I think  we\r\n\r\nwould have to leave the position as it is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still repeat what I have said before, that we\r\n\r\ndo really and sincerely hope that both sides would\r\n\r\nget  together  and iron out their differences  and\r\n\r\nthen  come  to us and say, \"We want to be  brought\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of this new procedure for the\r\n\r\nsettlement  of industrial disputes.\" I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Bench that there  would  be  none\r\n\r\nhappier   than  ourselves  to  introduce  amending\r\n\r\nlegislation for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I do not understand why\r\n\r\nit  should  be deleted now and then amended  at  a\r\n\r\nfuture date if, as the Hon.

What the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  can  do is to wait until an  agreement  is\r\n\r\nreached with Her Majesty's Government. Without the\r\n\r\namendment,   it  will  put  the  matter   in   the\r\n\r\nforefront.  And as soon as agreement  is  reached,\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara will then so declare.\r\n\r\nIf  this is not to be there, I submit that all the\r\n\r\nlaws  that  cover Services departments  should  be\r\n\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to\r\n\r\nlabour  this point.

It is because\r\n\r\nof that that the words \"and includes an officer or\r\n\r\na servant of the Government\" have been put in. But\r\n\r\nthat  is not the end of the matter. Merely putting\r\n\r\nin  the  phrase  \"and includes  an  officer  or  a\r\n\r\nservant  of  the Government\" does  not  in  itself\r\n\r\nplace a Government employee within the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance. It is the inclusion by the Yang di-\r\n\r\nPertuan  Negara  by  way of a  proclamation  which\r\n\r\nfinally  makes him an employee within the  meaning\r\n\r\nof this section. What then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the necessity for deleting the words sought to\r\n\r\nbe  deleted from this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, when\r\n\r\nthe   inclusion  of  those  words  would  not   in\r\n\r\nthemselves  bring  that group of employees  within\r\n\r\nthe  framework of the Ordinance, unless and  until\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara so  declares?  So  it\r\n\r\nseems to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, particularly as the\r\n\r\nMinister himself has said, that there are only one\r\n\r\nor  two  points  on  which  agreement  has  to  be\r\n\r\nreached, and as soon as that is achieved, the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara can then so proclaim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the essential point\r\n\r\nis  this: that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, as  our\r\n\r\nHead of State, would on the recommendation of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet, be able to make a declaration to  include\r\n\r\ncertain  categories of Government servants  within\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"employee\".

He can do that only after agreement is\r\n\r\nreached  between this Government and Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment. It is only then that he can make  such\r\n\r\na declaration. But he could easily declare a local\r\n\r\nGovernment  servant  as  an  \"employee\"  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose on the advice of the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nand that is the distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, we understand the position that\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara is the Constitutional\r\n\r\nHead   of   State.

The  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  wanted  to know  why  the  President\r\n\r\nshould  not  be a public servant. I am advised  by\r\n\r\nthe  law  officers of the Crown that the President\r\n\r\nof  this  Court is a judicial officer and  he  has\r\n\r\npowers of supervising the procedure in this  Court\r\n\r\nor  punishing contempt under clause 54 of the Bill\r\n\r\nand he has got all the powers which appertain to a\r\n\r\nJudge.  For that reason, it is not desirable  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be any declaration in  this  clause\r\n\r\nthat the President should be a public servant.

So  long as a person is  nominated  by\r\n\r\neither  body, it does not come within the  meaning\r\n\r\nof  that clause, and unless the Minister is of the\r\n\r\nopinion that the person to be appointed by him  is\r\n\r\na  fit and proper person, such person will not  be\r\n\r\nappointed.  Therefore, once the  Minister  has  so\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  a person is  a  fit  and  proper\r\n\r\nperson to be appointed to a panel of the Court  of\r\n\r\nArbitration,  I see no reason why we should  bring\r\n\r\nin  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to have a  say  in\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  of  the opinion that the  Minister's\r\n\r\nopinion  is not a good opinion; and we know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nconstitutionally, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  only\r\n\r\nacts  on  the  advice of the Minister.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nsuch  a  thing can only happen and may happen:  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, having considered a man to be a fit\r\n\r\nand  proper person, appoints him to the Court  and\r\n\r\nthen  finds that that person is not carrying  out,\r\n\r\nshall  we  say, the duties to his liking,  he  may\r\n\r\nthen advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to say that\r\n\r\nthat person should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  removed because the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  is\r\n\r\nof  the opinion, on the advice of the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law, that that person is no  longer  a\r\n\r\nfit and proper person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sub-clause (2) (a) deals with the removal\r\n\r\nby the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of a person who \"has\r\n\r\nbecome  permanently incapable of  discharging  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  a member of the Court\".  Sir,  such\r\n\r\nduties  should not devolve on the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  If  a  person is permanently handicapped,\r\n\r\nsurely it is easy and free for the Minister to put\r\n\r\nin  the  sub-clause proposed by me,  that  when  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  become handicapped  to  that  extent,\r\n\r\ntherefore  the Minister shall remove  him  from  a\r\n\r\npanel of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on sub-clause 2.

I  have   already\r\n\r\nexplained to the House that the Government intends\r\n\r\nto  restrict  the collective bargaining  procedure\r\n\r\nand  procedure  before  the arbitration  court  to\r\n\r\nsingle   employers  and  to  a  trade   union   of\r\n\r\nemployees.  As  I  have already explained  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  a trade union of employers would enjoy,  a\r\n\r\nsuperior   bargaining   position   in   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining  to  a  trade union of  employees.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  it  is common  knowledge  that  in\r\n\r\nindustry  at  the  present time,  there  are  some\r\n\r\nemployers  in the same industry who are in  unions\r\n\r\nand some who are not. If the employers who are  in\r\n\r\ntrade unions enter into collective agreements,  it\r\n\r\nmight  be  that the rates which have  been  agreed\r\n\r\nmight be such that those employers who are not  in\r\n\r\ntrade  unions will not be able to pay. If that  is\r\n\r\nso,  then the employers who are not in the  unions\r\n\r\nmay  be put out of business, and the result  would\r\n\r\nbe that the workers would be the persons who would\r\n\r\nsuffer.  So  we  have decided that this  procedure\r\n\r\nshould  be open only to a trade union of employees\r\n\r\nand single employers. If I am not mistaken, during\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the Second Reading,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill posed this  question.  What\r\n\r\nwould  happen,  he asked, if there  were  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  of  employers which enters into  collective\r\n\r\nagreements   with   a  trade  union   of   workmen\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  workmen scattered  throughout,\r\n\r\nsay,  different industries? Would the trade  union\r\n\r\nof  employers have to conclude separate agreements\r\n\r\nwith the same trade union of employees? The answer\r\n\r\nnow is to be found in the amendment that I will be\r\n\r\nmoving,  that  is, that the collective  bargaining\r\n\r\nprocedure  should be open only to single employers\r\n\r\nand a trade union of employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since it has been proposed\r\n\r\nthat  all  references to trade unions of employers\r\n\r\nshould  be  deleted from this Bill, I submit  that\r\n\r\nthe  definition \"trade union\" should  also  be  so\r\n\r\namended. Or it might be that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  be  no definition at all, because  with  the\r\n\r\npresent definition as it stands, a trade union can\r\n\r\nbe a trade union of employees - even if the Minister\r\n\r\nwere  to change \"workmen\" to \"employees\" -  and also\r\n\r\na  trade union of employers. In many places in the\r\n\r\nBill,  reference is made to \"a trade union\", which\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken to imply that it can  be  \"a  trade\r\n\r\nunion   of   employees\"  or  \"a  trade  union   of\r\n\r\nemployers\".   So  if  one  were  to   remove   all\r\n\r\nreferences   to  \"a  trade  union  of  employers\",\r\n\r\ntherefore the definition of \"trade union\"  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  amended. And if it is amended. I think it will\r\n\r\nbe  less cumbersome if all references to a  \"trade\r\n\r\nunion  of  employees\" can just be described  as  a\r\n\r\n\"trade union\", so that there could be consistency,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  some places it is \"a trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployees\" and in other places \"a trade union\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will no doubt\r\n\r\nconsider that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendments made: In page 6, line 23, to\r\n\r\nleave  out  \"workmen\" and insert \"employees\".-[Mr\r\n\r\nByrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, lines 24 and 25, to leave out \"and\r\n\r\ntrade unions of employers\".-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, line 33, to leave out \"workmen\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"employees\".-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, lines 36 and 37, to leave out \", or\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  of  employers  who  represent   the\r\n\r\nmajority,\".-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think this is an appropriate\r\n\r\ntime to suspend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the\r\n\r\nCommittee and took the Chair of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Assembly is suspended.

Although\r\n\r\nI  have  not tabled an amendment, I would like  to\r\n\r\nseek the views of the Minister on this sub-clause.\r\n\r\nAccording  to my reading of it, if one union  were\r\n\r\nto  serve notice on four employers and if  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  three employers, an agreement  had  been\r\n\r\nreached, but in the case of the fourth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer, no agreement had been reached, the union\r\n\r\nmay report to the Commissioner all the matters  in\r\n\r\ndispute,  and  not only that matter  on  which  no\r\n\r\nagreement had been reached. Here again, there is a\r\n\r\ntime  limit of 14 days. It says here that  a  time\r\n\r\nlimit of 14 days shall apply to the latest date of\r\n\r\nthe last notice on the last employer. Would it not\r\n\r\nbe clearer if we were to limit this particular sub-clause to just one union and one employer? So long\r\n\r\nas  that union and that employer have not come  to\r\n\r\nagreement  during negotiations, that matter  shall\r\n\r\nbe  reported. If it were to be a union  and  three\r\n\r\nemployers where agreement had not been reached  in\r\n\r\nall  three  cases,  surely the  union  would  then\r\n\r\nreport to the Commissioner for Labour. The fact as\r\n\r\nit  stands  is  that if one union has  reached  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with two employers but has not  reached\r\n\r\nan  agreement with the third employer,  the  whole\r\n\r\nthing  is  in the melting pot. And vice  versa  in\r\n\r\ncase  an  employer  settles the dispute  with  one\r\n\r\nunion but not with the other two unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in clause 16, a\r\n\r\nnotice will be served by a trade union on a single\r\n\r\nemployer. That is to say, in the case of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion   which  is  negotiating  with  say,   three\r\n\r\nemployers,  there  will be three separate  notices\r\n\r\nserved, one on each employer, so that if agreement\r\n\r\nis reached with two employers and agreement is not\r\n\r\nreached  with the third employer, then the  issues\r\n\r\nwill  die  as  far as the first two employers  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and will still exist  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nthird  employer  is concerned.

The same thing applies  to  clause\r\n\r\n20.

Sir, we have been informed\r\n\r\nthat  the  present Government, in their desire  to\r\n\r\nbring their Back-benchers closer to the Government\r\n\r\nhave allotted a certain number of them to jobs  in\r\n\r\neach  Ministry. It has happened - so it was reported\r\n\r\nto  me - that  those  Assemblymen  who  are  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour and Law have  taken  it  upon\r\n\r\nthemselves to give directives in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister - that the Minister wants this and that  to\r\n\r\nbe  done, and that the Minister would be happy  if\r\n\r\nsuch and such a thing could be done. Therefore, to\r\n\r\nprevent  a  cross-current of directives issued  by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  through  the  Assemblymen  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  I feel that such directives  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven   in   writing  so  that  the   enthusiastic\r\n\r\nAssemblymen in the particular Ministry may not  be\r\n\r\ntempted to use the powers of the Minister and give\r\n\r\nan oral directive, saying that the Minister has so\r\n\r\ndirected.  But if it is in writing, it  is  clear,\r\n\r\nand  the  person receiving such a directive  shall\r\n\r\nhave  to take heed. I do not see any reason why  a\r\n\r\nperson  should be so directed by just an  ordinary\r\n\r\nBack-bencher using the name of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is necessary for\r\n\r\nthe person whom the Minister directs to preside at\r\n\r\na   conciliation  conference  to  be  given  these\r\n\r\npowers.

One way is that an  employer\r\n\r\nand  a  trade union of employees both  agree  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  refer  their trade  dispute  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt,   and  the  Court  then  takes  cognizance.\r\n\r\nParagraph (b), as it stands, says that even though\r\n\r\nthe Minister may have directed the Commissioner to\r\n\r\nnotify  the  Registrar of the Court that  a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute exists, the President of the Court may, if\r\n\r\nhe feels that a further attempt at conciliation is\r\n\r\ndesirable,  not  take  cognizance  of  the   trade\r\n\r\ndispute,  but may exercise his power under  clause\r\n\r\n29.  As we know, Sir, there is now agreement  that\r\n\r\nclause  29 should be deleted. I feel that  once  a\r\n\r\nnotification has been made to the Registrar of the\r\n\r\nCourt by the Commissioner on the direction of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in accordance with clause 18  or  clause\r\n\r\n20,  then  the Court must take cognizance  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Honourable Members will have\r\n\r\nnoticed that the Minister himself has given notice\r\n\r\nof art amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, to leave out lines 9 to 14 inclusive-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>in effect, the whole of paragraph (b).

I have taken the trouble to explain to the\r\n\r\nHouse that our intention in removing the whole  of\r\n\r\nparagraph   (b)   is  that  we  must   give   some\r\n\r\nrecognition to the bargaining power of  unions  in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  collective bargaining.  We  must\r\n\r\nnever  give  the impression that arbitrations  are\r\n\r\nautomatic. That is why, in removing the provisions\r\n\r\nof paragraph (b) as we have proposed, we have also\r\n\r\nproposed a further amendment to paragraph  (c)  of\r\n\r\nthe same clause, so that the Minister has an over-\r\n\r\nriding right to send any trade dispute, whether it\r\n\r\nis  an  ordinary trade dispute or a trade  dispute\r\n\r\naffecting  essential services, to arbitration.  He\r\n\r\ncan  do this at any time, whether at the time when\r\n\r\nboth  parties refuse to negotiate, or any  of  the\r\n\r\nparties refuses to negotiate, or at the time  when\r\n\r\nnegotiations  deadlock. Whether he has  intervened\r\n\r\nin  conciliatory proceedings or not, the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas that over-riding right to send any dispute  to\r\n\r\narbitration.  We have done that, because  we  must\r\n\r\ngive some regard to the collective strength of the\r\n\r\nunions in the bargaining process. Sometimes with a\r\n\r\nlittle  show  that  they are  determined  to  take\r\n\r\naction, the unions might be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersuade  the employers to see the reasonableness\r\n\r\nof  their  demands. That is the reason which  has\r\n\r\ninduced  us  to  make  these amendments.  If  the\r\n\r\namendment  which  the Member  for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\nsuggested  were  to be made,  that  is  once  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has refused to intervene and  it  stops\r\n\r\nthere - as indicated in clause 18 (4) and clause 20\r\n\r\n(b) - then  there will be an automatic notification\r\n\r\nto  the Registrar of the Court, in which case the\r\n\r\nCourt  automatically takes cognizance.  Now  that\r\n\r\ncould  be  a very dangerous position  to  be  in,\r\n\r\nbecause  it may result in the Court being  bogged\r\n\r\ndown  with  a  lot of work if the  impression  is\r\n\r\ngiven  that  these arbitrations are automatic.  I\r\n\r\nhave explained all this, and it is clear from the\r\n\r\namendments proposed that we are giving effect  to\r\n\r\nthis intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a result\r\n\r\nof  reading this particular paragraph,  I  tabled\r\n\r\nthis  amendment, which was submitted to the Clerk\r\n\r\nlong  before the 10th of February, to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  President of the Court shall  not  again  be\r\n\r\ngiven  another  trial.  I  have  said  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister himself agrees that clause 29 should  be\r\n\r\ndisagreed to. There we are together. But if we do\r\n\r\nnot  have  this amendment to paragraph (b),  then\r\n\r\nunder  clauses  18 and 20, suppose  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwants  to  direct the Commissioner to notify  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar, where does he come in? Because he does\r\n\r\nnot  direct. He certifies in the Gazette. If that\r\n\r\nis  to  be  by certification, Sir, then I  submit\r\n\r\nthat clauses 18 and 19, as approved, should be so\r\n\r\namended.  Clauses 18 and 19 say \"notification  by\r\n\r\nthe   Commissioner  on  the  direction   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister.\" If there is to be no direction by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  the  Commissioner  to  notify   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar,  then  say  so.  There  need   be   no\r\n\r\ndirection. It can just be by a certification. But\r\n\r\nonce  you  have  it in clause 18 and  clause  20,\r\n\r\nwhere  comes  that direction? If a  direction  is\r\n\r\ngiven,  how is it going to be applied  in  clause\r\n\r\n28?  I  am just asking that. If it can be applied\r\n\r\nby  a  certification, well and good.  But  if  it\r\n\r\ncannot,  some  way  must be  found  whereby  such\r\n\r\nnotification can come under clause 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The main point, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nis this. If the Minister has the power, and it is\r\n\r\nthe  intention that the Minister should have  the\r\n\r\npower,   to  direct  that  a  trade  dispute   be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to arbitration, it is superfluous  for\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour to have such  power.\r\n\r\nIf we want to put it in that the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nLabour  shall  have  the  power  to  inform   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of the Court, then paragraph (c) should\r\n\r\nnot therefore be amended. Paragraph (c) could  be\r\n\r\nleft  out  altogether, because the  Minister  can\r\n\r\ndirect  the Commissioner to notify the Registrar.\r\n\r\nWhat is envisaged in this situation is this: that\r\n\r\nparties  to  a  dispute who do not  come  to  any\r\n\r\nsettlement may or may not find that the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  direct that the trade dispute be submitted\r\n\r\nto  arbitration. The procedure would be that  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  by notice in the Gazette, so  directs,\r\n\r\nand  the  administrative procedure would be  that\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner would be told by the Minister to\r\n\r\ninform the Court. The reason why we consider  the\r\n\r\namendment by the Member for Cairnhill to  be  unacceptable is this. It would, in fact, mean a re-establishment of the original position,  and  the\r\n\r\noriginal  position envisaged  in  this  Bill  was\r\n\r\ndeadlock and automatic cognizance by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, by this amendment, moved away from that\r\n\r\noriginal  position, in that we  foresee  possible\r\n\r\nrecalcitrants, either on the part of the union or\r\n\r\nthe  employer, not wanting to reach a  settlement\r\n\r\nby  negotiation,  because the recalcitrant  party\r\n\r\nknows  that any way the dispute will be going  to\r\n\r\narbitration,  so  there is no harm  in  stalling.\r\n\r\nThis   may   result  in  one   of   two   things.\r\n\r\nTheoretically speaking, you may get  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere   there  are  pending  in  the  Court,   by\r\n\r\nautomatic  notification,  one  hundred   or   two\r\n\r\nhundred cases, and it will be impossible for  the\r\n\r\nCourt  to  resolve these disputes for  months  or\r\n\r\nmaybe years. Therefore until we know exactly  how\r\n\r\nthe  machinery functions, we consider moving into\r\n\r\na  more practical position, one where it goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court,  when  both parties consent,  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister   directs.  The  Minister  directs,   he\r\n\r\ngazettes his directions, and the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nLabour  informs the Registrar. Whether a  dispute\r\n\r\ngoes to arbitration or not, if the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparties  cannot  agree,  depends  solely  on   the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of  the  Minister.  And  whether   the\r\n\r\nMinister   directs  that  the  dispute   goes   to\r\n\r\narbitration  or not depends upon the  position  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court at that time, the position with respect\r\n\r\nto  that particular dispute. I therefore urge upon\r\n\r\nthe  House that if we accept the position - that  we\r\n\r\nare  unable  to  predict exactly  the  pattern  of\r\n\r\nconduct that unions and employers will follow as a\r\n\r\nresult  of the implementation of this provision - it\r\n\r\nwill then be wiser to leave the discretion to  the\r\n\r\nMinister alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I can understand all that and\r\n\r\nI sympathise with the Government.

But what I have been trying to  point\r\n\r\nout  to  the  Government is this.  Clause  18  and\r\n\r\nclause  20  lay down certain requirements  on  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner.  Now  it is well  and  good  if  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   notifies  the  Minister   and   the\r\n\r\nMinister  directs, \"Hold your hand, do not  inform\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar.\" Then paragraph (c) will come  in.\r\n\r\nBut  suppose  the  Minister says,  \"Go  ahead  and\r\n\r\nnotify.\"  Where does it come in? If  you  look  at\r\n\r\nparagraph (c), Sir, the amendment, if I have  read\r\n\r\nit  right, is that the Minister by notice  in  the\r\n\r\nGazette   directs  that  the  trade   dispute   be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to arbitration. Which trade dispute  is\r\n\r\nit? We do not know. But it must be qualified as to\r\n\r\nwhich  trade  dispute it is. But if one  says  the\r\n\r\ntrade dispute that is notified to him under clause\r\n\r\n18  or  clause  19, one can then  understand  what\r\n\r\ntrade  dispute  it is.  But it just  says  directs\r\n\r\n\"the trade dispute\". There is no qualification for\r\n\r\nthe particular trade dispute. If the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nwill  read what this amendment is about,  then  he\r\n\r\nwill   know.  He  has  withdrawn  the  words   \"an\r\n\r\nessential  service\"  but has  left  in  the  words\r\n\r\n\"trade   dispute\"  which  refers   to   \"essential\r\n\r\nservice\", and that means nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that we are also\r\n\r\ndebating  amendment  (iv).

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, my attention has been drawn to clauses 18\r\n\r\n(4) and 20 (b). Those are the clauses where it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  that when there has been  a  refusal  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  by one of the parties or  by  both  the\r\n\r\nparties,  or when negotiation has broken down,  it\r\n\r\nwill be the duty of the Commissioner to notify the\r\n\r\nMinister,   and  unless  the  Minister   otherwise\r\n\r\ndirects,      the      Registrar      will      be\r\n\r\ninformed - information, that is all.  There  is  all\r\n\r\nthe   difference  in  the  world   between,   say,\r\n\r\ninformation, (that is, the Registrar of the  Court\r\n\r\nis informed), and what the Member for Cairnhill is\r\n\r\nnow  wanting us to agree to, namely, that once the\r\n\r\nMinister  has directed the Commissioner to  notify\r\n\r\nthe   Registrar,   then  the  Court   shall   take\r\n\r\ncognizance. That is where we disagree. We say that\r\n\r\nthere is nothing wrong in this and I think that it\r\n\r\nis  desirable  that  the Registrar  of  the  Court\r\n\r\nshould be so informed. If there is a trade dispute\r\n\r\nbetween  two parties and one side has  refused  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate or both have refused to negotiate, or if\r\n\r\nnegotiations  have deadlocked, then the  Registrar\r\n\r\nshould  be informed, because he is the channel  of\r\n\r\ncommunication  between the  Commissioner  and  the\r\n\r\nCourt.  But  there is also a world  of  difference\r\n\r\nbetween the Registrar being informed and the Court\r\n\r\ntaking  cognizance. Now if the Member's  suggested\r\n\r\namendment  is  agreed  to,  then  the  moment  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  is  informed, the Court  will  have  to\r\n\r\nspring  into existence. The Court takes cognizance\r\n\r\nand the President is there. He is always there. It\r\n\r\nwill  be  his duty then to get the employer's  and\r\n\r\nemployee's  panels constituted. That  is  what  we\r\n\r\nseek  to avoid, and that is why we have taken  out\r\n\r\nthe  whole of paragraph (b) and made the amendment\r\n\r\nto paragraph (c) of the clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would\r\n\r\nappear that the Minister cannot understand what  I\r\n\r\nhave been trying to explain to him.

The\r\n\r\nMinister  can  still intervene and  say  that  the\r\n\r\nmatter  be  referred to arbitration. So there  are\r\n\r\nall  the safeguards written into the clause.  Now,\r\n\r\nall that we want to do by the amendment is to make\r\n\r\na  distinction between a mere routine  information\r\n\r\nto  the Court, and cognizance. We have got to draw\r\n\r\nthat distinction, because if the Court is informed\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Commissioner for  Labour  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause 18 (4)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  clause  20  (b),  well,  that  is  a  routine\r\n\r\ninformation  to  the Court. But if  the  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  the Member for Cairnhill makes is accepted,\r\n\r\nthen  on  mere  information the Court  shall  take\r\n\r\ncognizance.  It  is  a matter then  that  is  laid\r\n\r\nbefore the Court. There is a President and he will\r\n\r\nthen  have  to see that the panels are constituted\r\n\r\nfor  the Court. We do not want that to happen, and\r\n\r\nthat  is why we want to delete the whole of clause\r\n\r\n28 (b) and make the amendment to clause 28 (c). It\r\n\r\nis a very simple point and I do not understand why\r\n\r\nso much difficulty is seen in it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, could the position be this? The\r\n\r\nHon, the Prime Minister has said just now that  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  200 trade disputes, then the  position\r\n\r\nwill  be  very difficult. We understand that.  But\r\n\r\nsupposing  at that moment there is only one  trade\r\n\r\ndispute,  and  under clauses  18  and  20  certain\r\n\r\ndisputes  could not be settled. What then happens?\r\n\r\nThe  Commissioner shall notify the  Minister  and,\r\n\r\nunless   the   Minister  otherwise  directs,   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  that  a trade dispute  exists.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister  directs the Commissioner to  inform  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  and  the provisions  of  clause  18  or\r\n\r\nclause  20  are complied with, then by  virtue  of\r\n\r\nclause  28 as envisaged, the Court shall not  take\r\n\r\ncognizance of that trade dispute. If that  is  the\r\n\r\nposition,  then  the only way  in  which  a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute could be taken cognizance of would be  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to act under the proposed clause  28\r\n\r\n(c).  Is that the position the Government want  to\r\n\r\nreach?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, what we,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  have in clauses 18 and 20, is machinery\r\n\r\nwhereby  the Court is kept informed of the general\r\n\r\nindustrial  position. Whether it is  a  particular\r\n\r\ndispute  of  which  the  Court  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ninformed,  unless  the Minister  intercepts  under\r\n\r\nclause  18, will depend upon the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister. If the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  is  accepted, then it  means  that  the\r\n\r\nCourt, in accordance with the procedure of keeping\r\n\r\nit   abreast   of  all  negotiations   which   are\r\n\r\ndeadlocked, will automatically be notified by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner,  again  on  the  direction  of   the\r\n\r\nMinister - unless the Commissioner is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependent entity from the Minister - and it  will\r\n\r\nthen take cognizance.

Clause 31 says: \"Where  the\r\n\r\nCourt  has cognizance of a trade dispute...\".\r\n\r\nNow  the  only way in which cognizance of a  trade\r\n\r\ndispute could be taken by the Court would be under\r\n\r\nclause 28. Clause 28 (a), as amended, says that it\r\n\r\nshall be  a joint submission. Clause 28  (b)  is\r\n\r\noff.

So applying that to clause 31, if the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance and the Government union  do\r\n\r\nnot  jointly submit, it does not become cognizable\r\n\r\nby  the  Court.  If  the Minister  under  the  new\r\n\r\nparagraph  (b) does not direct it in the  Gazette,\r\n\r\nthe  Court  cannot take cognizance, and  similarly\r\n\r\nunder  the  new paragraph (c) the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  does not declare by proclamation, then  it\r\n\r\nis not a cognizable trade dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I dare say the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  will not proclaim unless he is advised  by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister.

But  as  the\r\n\r\noriginal  clause  28 stood, Sir, clause  31  could\r\n\r\nhave come into operation because, under clause  28\r\n\r\n(a),  it  could have been an individual submission\r\n\r\nrather  than  a joint submission.

If  it\r\n\r\nwere a matter of policy, or a matter that affected\r\n\r\npublic  interest  or affected  a  section  of  the\r\n\r\npublic, then I think it would be right and  proper\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  should be  brought  into  the\r\n\r\npicture.  But  here,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is   an\r\n\r\nindividual   complaint  from   somebody   who   is\r\n\r\naggrieved  by  an  award.  The  statute   provides\r\n\r\nmachinery  whereby that grievance can be  inquired\r\n\r\ninto  by  the  Commissioner, as he is  the  person\r\n\r\ncharged  with  that duty. In the circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nsee  no  reason whatsoever, other than  political,\r\n\r\nfor  bringing  the Minister and the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister into the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will look at clause 49\r\n\r\nof the Bill which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any trade union or person bound by an award who\r\n\r\nhas  committed any breach or non-observance of any\r\n\r\nterm of an award shall be guilty of an offence...\",\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  are  several safeguards of which  a  person\r\n\r\naggrieved  by  an award can avail  himself.  Under\r\n\r\nclause  49,  it  is made a criminal  offence,  and\r\n\r\nunder  clause 51 (5), the Commissioner  is  charged\r\n\r\nwith the duty of inquiring into a complaint to see\r\n\r\nwhether  such an award has, in fact, been  broken.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, other than to  complicate  the\r\n\r\nissue,  it  could serve no useful purpose  to  let\r\n\r\nthree  persons have the handling of the particular\r\n\r\ncomplaint, when eventually the complaint  will  be\r\n\r\ndirected,  to the Commissioner for inquiry.  Would\r\n\r\nit  not be better for the Commissioner himself  to\r\n\r\ngo into the complaint and then hold an inquiry? If\r\n\r\nthere has been any breach, perhaps action might be\r\n\r\ntaken under clause 49, or the Commissioner himself\r\n\r\nmight take action under the particular clause.  My\r\n\r\nown  view, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that once an award\r\n\r\nhas  been  made and machinery provided to  enquire\r\n\r\ninto  complaints,  particularly  when  that  is  a\r\n\r\ncriminal offence, it is highly undesirable for the\r\n\r\nMinister  and his Parliamentary Secretary  not  to\r\n\r\ncome into the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause deals\r\n\r\nspecifically  with the case of private  agreements\r\n\r\nwhich  arise out of collective agreements.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  not right and proper that  a  Minister\r\n\r\nand his Parliamentary Secretary should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  deprived of the powers which are granted to an\r\n\r\nofficial  of  the  Ministry, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in cases where this sub-clause\r\n\r\n(5)  applies, the complaint is usually made by the\r\n\r\naggrieved  person - the complaint  that,  say,  his\r\n\r\nemployer  is  not  giving  him  the  terms  of  an\r\n\r\nagreement   which  arose  out  of   a   collective\r\n\r\nagreement between the employer and the trade union\r\n\r\nwhich  represented him. In that  case,  surely  it\r\n\r\nshould be open to the aggrieved person to make his\r\n\r\ncomplaint  either  to  the  Minister  or  to   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary or to the Commissioner for\r\n\r\nLabour.  It may be a dispute between him  and  his\r\n\r\nemployer as to whether the award in the collective\r\n\r\nagreement is applicable to his private contract of\r\n\r\nservice. In that situation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwould   be  the  duty  of  the  Minister  or   his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, or the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour  to  refer  the matter in  dispute  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Court. Under this clause, we are  not,  in\r\n\r\nany  way,  attempting to side-step  the  procedure\r\n\r\nthat  is laid down with regard to the bringing  of\r\n\r\nactions before the Labour Court.

If an aggrieved person\r\n\r\ncomes to us, we will accept his complaint. We will\r\n\r\nfind  out what he wants. If we can, we will summon\r\n\r\nhis  employer,  and  if the employer  agrees  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a breach of the award, we will then  get\r\n\r\nhis   consent  to  meeting  the  request  of   the\r\n\r\naggrieved person. If not, and if there is an issue\r\n\r\nof  fact to be decided between them, we will  send\r\n\r\nthe matter to the Labour Court. That is all we are\r\n\r\nseeking to do under this clause.

A collective agreement,  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  when  it is registered  with  the\r\n\r\nCourt  becomes an award. So that the award spoken\r\n\r\nof,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in clause 51 is an  award\r\n\r\nwhich   might  either  be  given,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  by the Court or a collective agreement\r\n\r\nregistered with the Court.

These\r\n\r\npowers  are just the powers to summon either  the\r\n\r\nunion   or  the  employer  to  answer  truthfully\r\n\r\nquestions  relating  to  the  existence   of   an\r\n\r\nagreement.  The  enforcement  of  any  breach  of\r\n\r\nobservance of an agreement is not in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary or the\r\n\r\nCommissioner. Whilst, politically,  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not a duty which the Minister  would\r\n\r\nwant   to   perform  all  the  time,  there   are\r\n\r\nsituations  where  it is more judicious  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself to make such inquiries. It is, I\r\n\r\nthink,  a  common practice. When the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill   was  the  Minister  for  Labour   and\r\n\r\nWelfare,  not very infrequently he  had  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith employers and unions not only in relation to\r\n\r\nalleged breaches of awards but to a host of other\r\n\r\nimportant  matters  relating  to  employers   and\r\n\r\nunions.  There  is nothing novel  or  unusual  in\r\n\r\nthese provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Member will not\r\n\r\nbe moving amendments (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and\r\n\r\n(vii)*?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* see footnote at cols. 293-4.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 51, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 52 and 53 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 22, line 28, at end, to add-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(5) Where the Court punishes as contempt a\r\n\r\nfailure by a person to comply with an order of\r\n\r\nthe Court, that person shall, during a period of\r\n\r\ntwo years from the date on which the punishment\r\n\r\nis imposed, or such lesser period as the Court\r\n\r\nmay determine, be ineligible to be nominated for\r\n\r\nelection as an officer of a trade union or a\r\n\r\nbranch of a trade union or a federation of trade\r\n\r\nunions or to act as such an officer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A person who acts as an officer of a trade\r\n\r\nunion,  or  a  branch  of  a  trade  union  or  a\r\n\r\nfederation of trade unions while he is ineligible\r\n\r\nby reason of subsection (5) of this section shall\r\n\r\nbe  guilty  of an offence and shall be liable  on\r\n\r\nconviction  by  a District Court to  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a term not exceeding twelve months or  to  a\r\n\r\nfine  not  exceeding two thousand dollars  or  to\r\n\r\nboth such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  fine  and  for  a   second   or\r\n\r\nsubsequent offence shall be liable to imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a  term  not  less than six  months  and  not\r\n\r\nexceeding three years.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that\r\n\r\nit  is the intention of Government to negative the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of clause 56 and to add to  clause  54\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of clause 56 which  places  trade\r\n\r\nunion    leaders    under   restriction    against\r\n\r\nparticipation in trade union activities if they so\r\n\r\nconduct themselves as to commit contempt of court.\r\n\r\nThese sub-clauses give effect to that intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 55-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 22, line 29, to leave out from \"Court\"\r\n\r\nto the end of line 43 and insert-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that a number of members of a trade union\r\n\r\nsufficiently large to form a substantial part of\r\n\r\nits membership refuse to accept employment in\r\n\r\naccordance with an award the Court may, subject\r\n\r\nto such conditions as it thinks fit, by order\r\n\r\ncancel or suspend for such period as it thinks\r\n\r\nfit all or any of the terms of the award so far\r\n\r\nas the award applies to or is in favour of the\r\n\r\ntrade union or its members.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment we propose will\r\n\r\nenable   the  Court  to  cancel  or  suspend   the\r\n\r\noperation   of   an   award   in   more    limited\r\n\r\ncircumstances  than the Bill originally  proposed.\r\n\r\nThe power will be exercisable only in the event of\r\n\r\nmembers  of  a  trade union seeking  to  pick  and\r\n\r\nchoose   those  parts  of  an  award   which   are\r\n\r\nacceptable, and repudiating those parts which  are\r\n\r\nnot  acceptable.

In any event, he has told  the  House\r\n\r\nthat so far as an industrial dispute is concerned,\r\n\r\nit  will  be between a union of employees  and  an\r\n\r\nemployer. If that is correct - it must be  correct,\r\n\r\nbecause the Minister for Law has spoken - then  what\r\n\r\nis  the  meaning of \"being a trade  union  may  be\r\n\r\nrepresented by an officer of the trade union\" and,\r\n\r\nin addition to that, it talks about \"a trade union\r\n\r\nof  employees\"?

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause  62  have been carefully looked into.  That\r\n\r\nclause  deals with the position of parties  before\r\n\r\nthe  Court. As a matter of note, Sir, it  provides\r\n\r\nfor    representations   before   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration   Court, and  it   deals   with   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations of the parties before  the  Court.\r\n\r\nNow,  the employer may be in a trade union and  he\r\n\r\nmay  be  represented by an officer  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion.

It  is  because  the  original\r\n\r\nconcept  was  that the words \"trade union\"  should\r\n\r\ninclude  \"trade  union of employers\"  as  well  as\r\n\r\n\"trade union of employees\". But we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave since then departed from that concept and we\r\n\r\nnow  say  that  \"trade union\" shall  mean  \"trade\r\n\r\nunion of employees\". Until the Minister takes  it\r\n\r\nupon  himself to redefine \"trade union\" on page 3\r\n\r\nof  the Bill, we will be constantly running  into\r\n\r\nthis  difficulty. Since clause 62 (1)  (a)  reads\r\n\r\n\"being  a  trade  union\", we must necessarily  go\r\n\r\nback to page 3 to find out what \"trade union\"  is\r\n\r\nand  whether \"trade union\" is defined  as  \"trade\r\n\r\nunion   of   employers\"  or   \"trade   union   of\r\n\r\nemployees\".  Therefore,  as  the  definition  now\r\n\r\nstands, \"being a trade union of employers may  be\r\n\r\nrepresented by an officer of the trade  union  of\r\n\r\nemployers;\" or \"being a trade union of  employees\r\n\r\nmay  be  represented   . That is  how  it  should\r\n\r\nread,  Mr Speaker, Sir. An amendment is  brought\r\n\r\nin  to  draw a distinction between a trade union\r\n\r\nof employers and a trade union of employees. If I\r\n\r\nmay   take   it  upon  myself  to  redraft   this\r\n\r\nparagraph,  in view of the changes, I  think  all\r\n\r\nthat need be done is to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In proceedings before the Court a party or\r\n\r\nintervener-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) being a trade union of employees...,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and that would have solved the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No doubt the Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider  that point when he deals with  the  new\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"trade union\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have\r\n\r\nmade  the  position clear. A trade union  may  be\r\n\r\nrepresented by an officer of the trade union, and\r\n\r\nwe  go  on to add this provision in the amendment\r\n\r\nthat we propose - \"or, in the case of a trade union\r\n\r\nof employees, by an officer of the trade union or\r\n\r\nby  an  Industrial Relations Officer selected  by\r\n\r\nthe trade union\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are making the distinction.\r\n\r\nWe  show quite clearly the difference between the\r\n\r\nprovision  of clause 62 (1) (b) (ii) which  deals\r\n\r\nwith the representation of employers by officials\r\n\r\nof  their trade unions, and the services that  we\r\n\r\npropose for the union of employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 26, to leave out lines 3 to 7 inclusive\r\n\r\nand insert \"but may be represented by an advocate\r\n\r\nand solicitor if so desired.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tabled this amendment because I felt that\r\n\r\nto   deny  the  trade  unions  a  chance  to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  an  advocate  and  solicitor  to\r\n\r\npresent   their  case  concisely,   clearly   and\r\n\r\neffectively in the Arbitration Court would be  to\r\n\r\nmake it difficult for them. I did say, Sir - and it\r\n\r\nhas  now been accepted by the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law - that  not all trade union  officers  are\r\n\r\nwell trained and capable of handling the cases of\r\n\r\ntheir  unions before the Arbitration  Court.  And\r\n\r\npast  experience  has shown that  where  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  has  the  benefit of the  services  of  an\r\n\r\nadvocate and solicitor to represent it either  in\r\n\r\nconciliation proceedings or in a Court of Inquiry\r\n\r\nor  in  an Industrial Court, that union  has  the\r\n\r\nadvantage of having its case very well presented.\r\n\r\nThat  union,  with the help of  an  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor,  would  come out of  the  conciliation\r\n\r\nproceedings  in a much better light  than  if  it\r\n\r\nwere  denied the right to engage an advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor to look after its interests.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir, it has been the practice - in fact, the custom\r\n\r\ntoo - in  previous years that in trade disputes  of\r\n\r\nthis  kind,  unions were wont to  call  upon  the\r\n\r\nservices of advocates and solicitors who put  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of their knowledge and experience to  use\r\n\r\nwhen  presenting the unions' case. I do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  suggest  that,  because those  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors referred to by me earlier in my speech\r\n\r\nare  no  longer  in  a position  to  render  such\r\n\r\nassistance  to the trade unions, other  advocates\r\n\r\nand  solicitors should be so denied. I know  that\r\n\r\nthat  is  not the case. The way I look at  it  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government, in moving this  particular\r\n\r\nclause,  says  that it must be an  officer  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union. They do not want lawyers;  they  do\r\n\r\nnot   want   professional  agitators.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nclause 62, so far as it goes without the proposed\r\n\r\namendment, is good. I would have accepted that, I\r\n\r\nwould  have said an additional amendment  \"of  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  officer to assist a union\"  would  be\r\n\r\ngood  but  now -  I must range over  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment of the Minister - the Minister in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis proposed amendment, which is to be moved after\r\n\r\nmy  amendment, throws the gate wide open to people\r\n\r\nwho  may  not be honestly and sincerely  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the trade union movement. I refer,  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nprofessional  agitators. If we want to  close  the\r\n\r\ngate  to  advocates  and solicitors  from  helping\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  in presenting their case,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  close the gate to all those people  who  are\r\n\r\nnot   trade  unionists  or  who  are  not  closely\r\n\r\nconnected with the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  knows,  the  intention  is  to  exclude\r\n\r\nadvocates and solicitors from taking part  in  the\r\n\r\ncollective   bargaining  process   or   from   the\r\n\r\nrepresentation of interests before the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, except in cases where there are\r\n\r\nproceedings for contempt of the Court's  authority\r\n\r\nor    where   the   State   Advocate-General   has\r\n\r\nintervened, The reason why Government has  decided\r\n\r\nto  exclude  advocates and solicitors  from  these\r\n\r\nfunctions is that, though it is accepted that they\r\n\r\nare   skilled  in  the  orderly  presentation   of\r\n\r\narguments  before the Court and in the examination\r\n\r\nand cross-examination of witnesses, this very fact\r\n\r\nwould  give  the proceedings a forensic atmosphere\r\n\r\nwhich  would put a lay advocate at a disadvantage;\r\n\r\nso  that the side that does not have Counsel feels\r\n\r\nat  a  disadvantage. We have pointed out  that  it\r\n\r\nwill be necessary to make proceedings arising from\r\n\r\r\ncollective bargaining before the Court as informal\r\n\r\nas they can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is also the question of\r\n\r\nthe  costs  of  professional  representation.  The\r\n\r\nemployer's  side can well afford these costs,  but\r\n\r\nin  most cases they are prohibitive as far as  the\r\n\r\nemployees'  unions  are  concerned.  What  we  are\r\n\r\nseeking  to do is to extend to the arbitral  stage\r\n\r\nthat  spirit  which  prevails  in  the  bargaining\r\n\r\nprocess  rather  than to introduce Counsel,  forms\r\n\r\nand  the sort of approach that is common in courts\r\n\r\nof  law, where technical points are usually  taken\r\n\r\nin the course of arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  legislation should be to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nofficers of trade unions on either side to  handle\r\n\r\ntheir  own members' affairs. If they receive  this\r\n\r\nen-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncouragement, they will thereby increase their  own\r\n\r\nprestige  in this field. It is quite obvious  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not be able to develop this skill  and\r\n\r\nprestige  if, as soon as the case that is  handled\r\n\r\nby  them during the collective bargaining stage is\r\n\r\npassed on to the Court of Arbitration, Counsel are\r\n\r\nbrought  in and they take over from them. That  is\r\n\r\nnot  the way of increasing their prestige  and  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  sense of responsibility  that  we\r\n\r\nwant to see developed in these union officials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Mr Speaker, Sir, union officials\r\n\r\non  both sides who meet round the bargaining table\r\n\r\nand  in the Court develop a habit of dealing  with\r\n\r\neach  other on friendly terms, and they  will,  by\r\n\r\nclose  association, be able to have confidence  in\r\n\r\neach other and to establish close friendships.  In\r\n\r\ndealing with each other, they will be able to feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  are in industrial relations  together.\r\n\r\nSay you get trade union officials of employers and\r\n\r\nyou  get trade union leaders appointing their  own\r\n\r\nofficials,  Now in the bargaining process  and  so\r\n\r\non,  there  will be very hard words passed  across\r\n\r\nthe  table,  but  they will  get  to  respect  one\r\n\r\nanother in these discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the exclusion of advocates and\r\n\r\nsolicitors  only extends to those  who  appear  as\r\n\r\nsuch. There is nothing to prevent an officer of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union from being a professionally qualified\r\n\r\nman,  but special provision has been made in  this\r\n\r\nlegislation  to prevent a practising  lawyer  from\r\n\r\nhaving  himself  appointed as an  officer  of  the\r\n\r\nunion for a particular case so as to get round the\r\n\r\nprovisions     directed    against    professional\r\n\r\nrepresentation.   Such   a   person   must    have\r\n\r\nrelinquished his practice for six months before he\r\n\r\nmeddles in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to draw\r\n\r\nattention  to the fact that paid agents  are  also\r\n\r\nexcluded.  This is to stop people starting  a  new\r\n\r\ngroup  of  industrial  advocates - a  kind  of   new\r\n\r\nindustrial legal profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  are  indeed very surprised that this amendment\r\n\r\nshould  be made to the Bill, because, in the  eyes\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister,  it looks as if  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors who participate in the work of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreconciling the different parties in a trade dispute are\r\n\r\nhighly  undesirable  people.

If  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  their top leaders performed an  important\r\n\r\nfunction  in trade disputes in previous years, there  is\r\n\r\nno  reason  therefore  why their  fellow  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors should at this time be barred from conducting\r\n\r\nthe  activities which they did before, Although it would\r\n\r\nbar a former Chief Minister from activities in the trade\r\n\r\nunion  field, we on this side have decided that, in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of industrial peace, the door should also  not\r\n\r\nbe  open to others who would make it more difficult  for\r\n\r\nindustrial peace to be achieved, But when the amendments\r\n\r\nproposed by the Government open the door to anybody,  by\r\n\r\nwhatever  name,  to  come  in  and  interfere  in  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes,  I think it is wrong to exclude advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors.  If  it is the intention  of  Government  to\r\n\r\nbring about an amicable atmosphere conducive to an early\r\n\r\nsettlement   of   disputes,  and  that   advocates   and\r\n\r\nsolicitors   should   not   be   included   to   prolong\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  I  think  the  next  amendment   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister* should not come in.
