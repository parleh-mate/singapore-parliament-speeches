I suggested that drivers of Government vehicles should take every care to exercise their responsibility on the road, and that we should make every effort to ensure that Government\r\n\r\nvehicles  set  an example of social discipline  on\r\n\r\nthe  road.  The Minister for Law gave an assurance\r\n\r\nthat  circulars  would be sent out  to  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments to make sure that drivers  make  every\r\n\r\neffort  to  follow road regulations. The  Minister\r\n\r\nagreed  that drivers of Government vehicles should\r\n\r\nset an example in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find now that there is a supplementary request\r\n\r\nbeing  made for $70,000 to be used as compensation\r\n\r\nfor  damage  caused by Government  vehicles  which\r\n\r\nwere   involved   in  accidents.   It   would   be\r\n\r\ninteresting  for the House to know in what  manner\r\n\r\nthe   $20,000  originally  earmarked  under   this\r\n\r\nsubhead and this $73,000 is being spent. Does this\r\n\r\nindicate  that, for the past year since  the  last\r\n\r\nbudget,  there has been an increase in the  number\r\n\r\nof  accidents  involving Government vehicles,  the\r\n\r\nfault  for  which accidents must be attributed  to\r\n\r\nthe  drivers  of these vehicles? Or does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  much  more  is  being  spent  this  year  on\r\n\r\ncompensation  for  accidents than  for  any  other\r\n\r\nequal length of time in previous years? If one  or\r\n\r\nboth of these contentions are correct, one has  to\r\n\r\nrenew  the appeal to the Minister to take stronger\r\n\r\nmeasures   to  see  that  drivers  of   Government\r\n\r\nvehicles  exercise greater care and responsibility\r\n\r\non  the road. Perhaps the sending out of circulars\r\n\r\nis not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity of\r\n\r\ncommending  the Ministry of Defence on the  action\r\n\r\ntaken to see that its own drivers exercise greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  But  from my  own  experience,  I\r\n\r\npersonally  have found no discernible  improvement\r\n\r\nin  the  driving standard of drivers of Government\r\n\r\nvehicles since the time the Minister for Law  gave\r\n\r\nus the assurance that he believed that Government  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles  should  set  a  good  example   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Incidentally, it would be  interesting\r\n\r\nto know to what extent compensation has to be paid\r\n\r\nfor  damage  caused in accidents involving  police\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Once I had the experience of  seeing  a\r\n\r\npolice   vehicle   being   driven   in   a    most\r\n\r\nirresponsible   way.  The  driver  concerned   was\r\n\r\nattempting to write certain notes in his  notebook\r\n\r\nwhile driving the vehicle at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, if the amount of compensation in\r\n\r\nrespect  of accident claims is rising, how  is  it\r\n\r\nthat only $25,000 has been earmarked for this same\r\n\r\nsubhead in the coming financial year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Therefore,   iii    normal\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  an estimate of  $20,000  per  year\r\n\r\nwould have been deemed sufficient to meet accident\r\n\r\nclaims.  The year 1970 - 71 has actually cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,    including    the    request     for\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Estimates, about  $90,000  to  meet\r\n\r\naccident  claims  involving  Government  vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis  sum,  in my opinion, is abnormally  high.

Drivers  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  vehicles have also  been  educated  on\r\n\r\nroad  safety and have been instructed to  be  more\r\n\r\ncareful in their driving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for prosecution, there is provision for the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary of the respective Ministry  to\r\n\r\nconsider,  on  the advice of the Attorney-General,\r\n\r\nwhether  disciplinary action is called for against\r\n\r\nthe  driver of the Government vehicle involved  in\r\n\r\nan  accident. It is, however, the function of  the\r\n\r\nPolice   to  determine  whether  the  driver   has\r\n\r\ncommitted  a traffic offence. Where the  Attorney-\r\n\r\nGeneral is satisfied that the accident is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  negligence or recklessness of the driver,  he\r\n\r\nwill  instruct the Police to prosecute the  driver\r\n\r\nconcerned. There may, however, be instances  where\r\n\r\nprosecution   is   not   justified    but    other\r\n\r\ninstructions have been contravened, in which  case\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action is instituted by the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary concerned on the advice of the Attorney-\r\n\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will agree that the expenditure that\r\n\r\nwould be involved in any accident under this  vote\r\n\r\nis  not easily predictable. The greater the number\r\n\r\nof  accidents  involved, the larger  will  be  the\r\n\r\namount  of expenditure. In the 1970 - 71 financial\r\n\r\nyear,  the  sum  of $20,000 provided  has  clearly\r\n\r\nproved  inadequate, and another $70,000 is  needed\r\n\r\nto  meet  expenditure  of $88,475.24.  To  compare\r\n\r\nother  years,  in 1967, $13,200 was  incurred;  in 1968, $19,360.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969 - 70 549,739.75 - nearly $50,000 - but\r\n\r\nstill  not  near  $90,000. For the financial  year\r\n\r\n1971  - 72, two Members have pointed out that only\r\n\r\n$25,000 has been approved.

This amendment is moved in order to seek\r\n\r\nfurther  clarification  on  the  posts  that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry has been able to fill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Ministry should fill not\r\n\r\nonly  the  vacancies in the promotion  grades  but\r\n\r\nalso the many vacancies in the lower grades of the\r\n\r\nteaching  service.  Last  year  the  estimate  for\r\n\r\nSubstitute Relief Teachers alone was $1.3  million\r\n\r\nin  the General Education Department. In answering\r\n\r\na supplementary question on relief teachers last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek,  the  Minister of State for  Education  said\r\n\r\nthat   the  phenomenon  of  relief  teachers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to exist so long as teachers continue  to\r\n\r\ntake maternity leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a teacher for many years, and\r\n\r\nmaternity leave is not a new concept. It has  been\r\n\r\nthere all along. The reason for the employment  of\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers  now is due to  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and  not  that teachers  take  maternity\r\n\r\nleave. The position obtaining then was that  every\r\n\r\nschool had a quota of teachers over and above  the\r\n\r\nnumber   that   would  be  needed  for   all   the\r\n\r\nclassrooms. If any teacher went on long  leave  or\r\n\r\nmaternity   leave,  there  would   be   sufficient\r\n\r\nqualified  teachers to stand in. Because  of  this\r\n\r\nquota  of  teachers in each school,  I  deem  this\r\n\r\nnumber to be vacancies in the school as well.  The\r\n\r\nquestion is: will the Ministry attempt to fill not\r\n\r\nonly the vacant posts in the promotion grades, but\r\n\r\nalso the shortage of teachers in schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too seek\r\n\r\ninformation  similar  to that  asked  for  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is being asked to approve a sum of\r\n\r\nslightly  over  half  a million  dollars  for  the\r\n\r\npayment  of personal emoluments.

Therefore, I\r\n\r\nwill  be  grateful if the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nwill  indicate the number of vacant posts  in  the\r\n\r\nlast financial year, i.e., ending this month;  how\r\n\r\nmany have been filled, and what are the categories\r\n\r\nof  vacancies that have been filled.

The shortage is of such a magnitude  not\r\n\r\nbecause  no  attempt has been made by  either  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission  or  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to fill these vacancies wherever it can,\r\n\r\nbut  simply because we do not have the people with\r\n\r\nthe  requisite qualifications. I will be very glad\r\n\r\nindeed if either Member can indicate where we will\r\n\r\nbe  able to get the type of people we want to fill\r\n\r\nthese vacancies, not only in the higher grades but\r\n\r\nalso in the lower grades in the teaching service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clarification requested by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  on the request for an additional $524,000\r\n\r\nfor  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  respect  of\r\n\r\npersonal  emoluments can be given very  simply  by\r\n\r\nrepeating what is stated here.

But\r\n\r\nthe question I am posing now is that, as far as  I\r\n\r\nknow, this shortage has been in existence for  the\r\n\r\nlast three years. Year after year the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has been coming here and asking  for  a\r\n\r\nvote  for relief teachers.

I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  from the Minister what attempts the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  made  to  recruit teachers for  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice  in the last three years - the  number  of\r\n\r\ntimes  recruitment took place and  the  number  of\r\n\r\nteachers in the last three years who went  through\r\n\r\na  regular  teacher training course  to  fill  the\r\n\r\nvacancies  that  we  have had in  the  last  three\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member and I have the\r\n\r\nsame point of view. But he is probably holding one\r\n\r\nend  of the stick and I am holding the other  end.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to say here is that we know there\r\n\r\nare  large numbers of vacancies and attempts  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and  are  being  made  to  fill  these\r\n\r\nvacancies   with   people   with   the   requisite\r\n\r\nqualifications.  We  have been  advertising  these\r\n\r\nvacancies at the beginning of every year. However,\r\n\r\nonly two-thirds of those who were offered jobs  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education  accepted  them.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of people who apply for vacancies  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education is not equal to the  number\r\n\r\nof vacant posts. So there you are. People with the\r\n\r\nrequisite  qualifications are not  there.  Members\r\n\r\nshould  concede that the Ministry of Education  is\r\n\r\nnot  so stupid as not to fill up the establishment\r\n\r\ncompletely.

As a result,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  resort to the method  of  recruiting\r\n\r\nrelief teachers who have probably not had the same\r\n\r\nkind of training that we would wish them to have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,\r\n\r\nI  must say well done to the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nfor  being able to fill most of its vacant  posts.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Minister did ask Members to  suggest\r\n\r\nways  and means of assisting the Ministry  in  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of the various categories of officers,\r\n\r\nwhether   they   be  relief  teachers,   teachers,\r\n\r\nspecialist inspectors and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would imagine that when these vacancies\r\n\r\narise the Ministry would make representation  -  I\r\n\r\nstand  to  be  corrected - to the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  which, I believe,  is  the  body  that\r\n\r\nappoints such officers into the Government service\r\n\r\nafter  a  due  process  of  interviews.

I  wonder  whether  the  Minister,   his\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State and others are now  more  than\r\n\r\nconvinced that the salary scales for teachers  are\r\n\r\nnot so attractive as to attract enough applicants.\r\n\r\nWould  they not think that in order to solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem  the Government should seriously  consider\r\n\r\nrevising    the   salary   scales   for   teachers\r\n\r\nimmediately?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would hate\r\n\r\nto   think  that  teachers  in  the  service   are\r\n\r\nattracted only by the salary scales and that there\r\n\r\nare  no  other incentives. I would like to believe\r\n\r\nthat  a large proportion of the teachers are there\r\n\r\nbecause  they feel that they have the  skill,  the\r\n\r\nability and the interest in imparting knowledge to\r\n\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein,  I  think  he is not  unaware  that  the\r\n\r\nTeachers  Union has been holding discussions  with\r\n\r\nofficials  of  the  Ministry of Education  on  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring - I would like to emphasise the word\r\n\r\n\"restructuring\" -of the salary scales and  not  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  salary.  I  think  there  was   some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  when,  on   the   eve   of   his\r\n\r\ndeparture, my predecessor made some mention  about\r\n\r\nthe  revision of salary scales. What  he  actually\r\n\r\nmeant  was  that the Ministry was  taking  up  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by  the  Harvey  Commission  when   it\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  the  salary  structure   in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education is of a very complex  nature\r\n\r\nand  that  there  are a lot of  anomalies  in  the\r\n\r\nsalary    structure   of   teachers.   What    was\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  my predecessor's  mind  was  the\r\n\r\nreference to post allowances for teachers who  are\r\n\r\npromoted.  What  he  meant  was  that  all   these\r\n\r\nanomalies should be ironed out. We can easily iron\r\n\r\nout  these  anomalies  and  incorporate  the  post\r\n\r\nallowance  or  part of the post allowance  into  a\r\n\r\nhigher  scale  for principals and  those  who  are\r\n\r\npromoted  to a higher grade. On going through  the\r\n\r\nrepresentations from the Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnion, the Ministry is in agreement with them.  It\r\n\r\nhas  come  to the conclusion that the 16 different\r\n\r\nsalary  scales  for the teachers and,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nabout  nine  different scales for  the  principals\r\n\r\nshould   be  thoroughly  considered  and  a   less\r\n\r\ncomplicated    salary    structure    substituted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in considering the restructuring of  the\r\n\r\nsalary scales proposed by the Teachers Union,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  must  also take into consideration  that\r\n\r\nany   adjustment  upward  is  going  to  cost  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers a lot of money. A rough calculation  was\r\n\r\nmade  that if each teacher were to be given a  $10\r\n\r\nincrement, it would cost the taxpayers  more  than\r\n\r\n$2  million. Before we make any recommendation for\r\n\r\nthe  spending  of such a large sum of  money,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  must be thoroughly studied  to  see  that\r\n\r\nwhat  we are doing is correct. I hope that answers\r\n\r\nthe question raised by the Member for Moulmein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Punggol again, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  vacancies is known to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation   and  the  Public  Service  Commission.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements are put out at the appropriate time\r\n\r\nand applications are received and processed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the number of applications for\r\n\r\nposts in the Ministry of Education is not equal to\r\n\r\nthe number of vacancies. Even if you take everyone\r\n\r\nwho  applies, you will still be short of teachers.\r\n\r\nThat is why we must have relief teachers. I think,\r\n\r\nas  an  ex-teacher, the Member for  Punggol  would\r\n\r\nprefer  to have fully qualified teachers in  three\r\n\r\nyears  from  now  rather than  teachers  who  have\r\n\r\nreceived only part-time teacher training.  But  we\r\n\r\nare reconsidering the question whether, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing  circumstances, it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nbetter for us to take half a loaf than to expect a\r\n\r\nfull  loaf when it is not forthcoming, because  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have enough people interested in teaching\r\n\r\nto  join the service. This is not because  of  the\r\n\r\npay.  As  I say, a good teacher does not  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend on his pay for his incentive. He has  other\r\n\r\nthings which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninduce  him to join the teaching service. We  will\r\n\r\nconsider  again carefully whether it is worth  our\r\n\r\nwhile,  in view of the grave shortage of teachers,\r\n\r\nto  reintroduce  part-time teacher training.  This\r\n\r\nshortage  is not only in the teaching service  and\r\n\r\nin   every  Government  department,  but  also  in\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave\r\n\r\nyour  indulgence  to interrupt again  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education,  in  his  reply  to   my\r\n\r\nobservation,  has  mentioned the Teachers  Unions'\r\n\r\npay  negotiations.  I thought I  might  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  mention also one or  two  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  I wanted to say in the Committee of  Supply\r\n\r\nwhen  I  move the amendment to reduce the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education's pay by $10. Since he has  already\r\n\r\ndealt  with  many  aspects of the  matter  that  I\r\n\r\noriginally intended to raise later, perhaps I will\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity to add one or two points  on\r\n\r\nthe   question   of  the  Teachers   Unions'   pay\r\n\r\nnegotiations. I am glad to hear from the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  his Ministry intends to go one step  further\r\n\r\nthan  its  original intention to remove  the  post\r\n\r\nallowance of the promotion posts and substitute it\r\n\r\nwith promotion scales, and that it intends also to\r\n\r\nlook  into the question of grievances, the 16  pay\r\n\r\nscales  of  teachers and so forth. I do appreciate\r\n\r\nthat it requires time to do an exercise like this.\r\n\r\nBut  I think sufficient time has been given to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  to  the Treasury to  consider  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  I can only express the hope, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the matter be considered  without  any\r\n\r\nfurther  delay as too much time has been taken  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter, in  fact,  the  then  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  made an announcement on 1st  September,\r\n\r\n1970,  that  he was going to invite  the  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnions  to discuss pay negotiations. Some time  in\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year,  the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\ninvited  the Teachers Unions to put forward  their\r\n\r\nproposals. Today is the 16th of March. It is about\r\n\r\nsix  months since we put forward our proposals and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is still studying them. It  is  fair\r\n\r\nenough  that  it  needs some  time  to  study  the\r\n\r\nproposals, but there seems to be no end to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  required for it. The teachers are  beginning\r\n\r\nto lose confidence in the whole exercise. They are\r\n\r\nwondering what it is all about. Is this a kind  of\r\n\r\njoke?  Their  expectations have been raised  as  a\r\n\r\nresult    of   the   then   Education   Minister's\r\n\r\nannouncement about pay negotiations.  Since  then,\r\n\r\nnearly seven months have elapsed and there is  not\r\n\r\neven  a squeak from the Ministry to indicate  what\r\n\r\ntheir reactions are to our proposals. Some of  our\r\n\r\nproposals  were put forward ten years ago.  Surely\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  does not require so  much  time  to\r\n\r\nstudy  them.  Perhaps it is not possible  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  at this juncture to give its answers  or\r\n\r\nreactions to all of them. That is fair enough. But\r\n\r\nsurely the Ministry should be in a position to say\r\n\r\nsomething  on some of the proposals. What  is  the\r\n\r\ncause  for  this delay? This situation is  causing\r\n\r\nunhappiness   in  the  teaching  profession.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry has given them the hope that negotiations\r\n\r\nare  forthcoming, but if it has to take more  than\r\n\r\nsix  months to study the proposals, and there does\r\n\r\nnot  seem to be an indication when this period  of\r\n\r\nstudy is going to end, I think you can quite fully\r\n\r\nappreciate the kind of frustration that is felt by\r\n\r\nthe teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the Minister's reply that time is\r\n\r\nrequired to study the very complex problems and  I\r\n\r\nagree  that  there are very complex problems.  But\r\n\r\nsix months should be more than sufficient for this\r\n\r\nand  I  hope  we should be hearing soon  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry regarding what its counter proposals are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education has mentioned just now that he will\r\n\r\nnot   consider  the  reintroduction  of  part-time\r\n\r\ntraining   courses   at  the  Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege.   Perhaps  I  would  like  to  draw   his\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  fact  that  out  of  so   many\r\n\r\nthousands  of  teachers in  the  teaching  service\r\n\r\ntoday,   I  can  safely  say  that  a  very   high\r\n\r\npercentage  of them somehow or other  did  undergo\r\n\r\npart-time training.

Shortly  after they were  converted  into\r\n\r\ngood gardens, the Roads Division came and dug them\r\n\r\nup and made them into traffic-light junctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I understand\r\n\r\nthat this sum is required to enable the Parks  and\r\n\r\nTrees   Division  to  undertake   a   more   rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment of parks and open spaces. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nbe  grateful if the Minister could enlighten  this\r\n\r\nHouse on the number of parks and open spaces  that\r\n\r\nwere created in the last financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to make this observation. In\r\n\r\nthe housing estates that I visited, I noticed that\r\n\r\nthere  were  some trees and shrubs and  children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds in some of the open spaces. But  there\r\n\r\nis  still room for development in a lot of housing\r\n\r\nestates with regard to open spaces and parks.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  a  huge circus in the Toa Payoh  Housing\r\n\r\nEstate  is  just simply bare. A lot of  money  has\r\n\r\nbeen  spent in planting some grass, but I see only\r\n\r\none  or  two  small parks for children in  between\r\n\r\nblocks  of flats. If the Parks and Trees  Division\r\n\r\nwould care to look into the possibility of turning\r\n\r\nsuch open spaces into parks, the residents in  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board Estates would be able to have  some\r\n\r\nrecreational   facilities  in  the   evenings   or\r\n\r\nweekends and not, as someone has pointed out, have\r\n\r\nto  contend  with blocks and blocks  of  concrete,\r\n\r\nlike  a concrete jungle. People do not know  their\r\n\r\nneighbours. As a result of having little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor   no   contact,  their  relationship   is   not\r\n\r\nstrengthened. This is probably the price  we  have\r\n\r\nto  pay for not looking into this aspect of public\r\n\r\nhousing.  There is no doubt that the provision  of\r\n\r\nopen  spaces and parks is being looked  into,  but\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  co-ordination  in  this  matter\r\n\r\nbetween the Urban Renewal Development Division and\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and  Development Board.  Whenever  a\r\n\r\nhousing  estate is put up, they should  look  into\r\n\r\nthe  question of providing such amenities for  the\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first give\r\n\r\nthe  details of the projects for which this  extra\r\n\r\nmoney  was  needed.  An  amount  of  $450,000  was\r\n\r\nprovided in the previous estimate. In early  1970,\r\n\r\nwhat  is called the \"Garden City Action Committee\"\r\n\r\nwas   established  in  the  Ministry  of  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development to plan  and  co-ordinate  a\r\n\r\nprogramme  of  work  to spruce up  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  objective being to make Singapore  more\r\n\r\nbeautiful for the Heads of State Conference  which\r\n\r\nwas  held here last January. A substantial  number\r\n\r\nof projects were planned. This amount of money was\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  insufficient. Hence a supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision  of  $914,900.  The  break-down  is   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Development of park \r\n\r\n    outside the Istana                 $118,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Improvement to the \r\n\r\n    Esplanade Parka at\r\n\r\n    Connaught Drive                    $ 60,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Improvement and\r\n\r\n    extension to the food\r\n\r\n    stalls at Elizabeth Walk           $101,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bukit Timah Christian\r\n\r\n    Cemetery-exhumation\r\n\r\n    of graves and reinterment\r\n\r\n    to convert the \r\n\r\n    cemetery into a park               $160,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some work in connection \r\n\r\n    with the sun-dial garden\r\n\r\n    at Botanic Gardens                 $ 50,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development of open\r\n\r\n    spaces at Dunearn-Whitley\r\n\r\n    Roads, Adam Road,\r\n\r\n    Dunearn Road and\r\n\r\n</pre>    \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    in front of the\r\n\r\n    Orchard Road Market                $ 65,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aviary at Katong Park                $ 10,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pagoda at River Valley Road          $ 20,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nursery at Ulu Pandan                $ 50,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nursery at Sembawang                 $ 67,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Plant Sales Center\r\n\r\n    at Floral Mile                     $  6,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Purcahse fo four pick-ups\r\n\r\n    and two tankers                    $ 63,000\r\n\r\n</pre>  \r\n\r\nI am sure the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nhas not failed to get his maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Training of 200 gardeners            $120,000\r\n\r\n  Purchase of four portable\r\n\r\n    fountains for use at the\r\n\r\n    Botanic Gardens                    $ 12,000\r\n\r\n  Landscaping and planting \r\n\r\n    of shrubs, flowers and\r\n\r\n    tress in open spaces,\r\n\r\n    side-tables and traffic\r\n\r\n    islands                            $250,000\r\n\r\n  Development of wooded\r\n\r\n    areas                              $ 40,000\r\n\r\n  Construction of timber\r\n\r\n    screens at various places          $160,000  \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Member for Telok Blangah complimented\r\n\r\nthe Parks and Trees Division, he cautioned that we\r\n\r\nshould  not forget the maintenance. The answer  is\r\n\r\nthat we have not. Instructions have been given not\r\n\r\nto  plant unless we can maintain. We would  rather\r\n\r\nhave  no  shrubs  and flowers than have  half-dead\r\n\r\nwilting  shrubs. In fact, fleets of  lorries  with\r\n\r\nwater  go out when there is a dry spell.  They  do\r\n\r\nwatering in most places, sometimes at least  twice\r\n\r\na  day.  As for planting along road sides, monsoon\r\n\r\ndrains   and  sometimes  along  foot-paths,   some\r\n\r\nmistakes  have  been  made. I  need  not  go  into\r\n\r\ndetails,  but  whenever these are  made  they  are\r\n\r\nrectified.  For instance, along Orchard  Road.  As\r\n\r\neveryone knows, the angsana trees were planted too\r\n\r\nclose  to  one  another, but they  were  purposely\r\n\r\nplanted  that  way to accelerate the programme  of\r\n\r\nplanting  in making Singapore greener for  January\r\n\r\n197l. As a net result, Orchard Road looked much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreener during that month. But the trees were  not\r\n\r\nwasted. As soon as they grow too big, they will be\r\n\r\npulled  out and planted in other places.  Mistakes\r\n\r\nhave  been  made. Where you have a nice foot-path,\r\n\r\nthe  next day you find angsana trees in the middle\r\n\r\nof  it. I myself have had cause to complain.  Some\r\n\r\nof  these trees have been pulled out, others  left\r\n\r\nalone  to  take  root in order that  they  may  be\r\n\r\nplanted  elsewhere. Sometimes ridiculous  mistakes\r\n\r\nhave been made. For example, trees planted next to\r\n\r\na flat, or next to a retaining wall. They have had\r\n\r\nto  be  pulled  out, otherwise the retaining  wall\r\n\r\nwould come down. But these are mistakes which have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and instructions have been given  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be closer supervision  of  the  work\r\n\r\ndone. Most of the work is done by contractors. One\r\n\r\nof  the contracts is to plant a tree on both sides\r\n\r\nof  the  road  every  50  yards.  Unless  properly\r\n\r\nsupervised,  all they do is to measure  50  yards,\r\n\r\ndig a hole, fill it with fertilizer and then plant\r\n\r\na tree in it. They do not care whether the spot at\r\n\r\nwhich  they  plant is next to a lamppost,  a  fire\r\n\r\nhydrant or under another tree! The net result  was\r\n\r\nthat we finally had to issue a series of do's  and\r\n\r\ndon'ts.  \"Do  plant trees along  unshaded  areas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't plant trees under lamp-post or under  other\r\n\r\ntrees.\" I think these mistakes will continue to be\r\n\r\nmade,  and perhaps other mistakes will have to  be\r\n\r\ncorrected.  They have even planted trees  along  a\r\n\r\nrubber  estate where the rubber trees are  already\r\n\r\nin  a  row and are properly shaded! When I queried\r\n\r\nthem, I was told that this was a nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the roundabouts, the one at Braddell\r\n\r\nCircus  was  planted with small trees  and  shrubs\r\n\r\nmore  than  three years ago. At that time  it  was\r\n\r\nknown that the roundabout would have to disappear,\r\n\r\nand  traffic  lights to control the  left  traffic\r\n\r\nlanes  instituted. But instead  of  waiting  three\r\n\r\nyears  and leaving the roundabout with just grass,\r\n\r\nit  was  decided to plant. Now that the roundabout\r\n\r\nhas  been converted into a traffic light junction,\r\n\r\nthe  shrubs  and  trees,  wherever  they  can   be\r\n\r\nrecovered, have been planted elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the roundabout at Shenton Way, Shenton Way\r\n\r\nis  an  important  place.  Important  people  pass\r\n\r\nthere.  Instead of leaving it bare, we decided  to\r\n\r\nplant, even if it was for a short while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal with the Member for Punggol who\r\n\r\nhas suddenly become interested in Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am interested in parks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I assume there are some in Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Private ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Private housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members' complaints, in general, are that\r\n\r\nthere  is not enough grass and greenery. Ten years\r\n\r\nago  we  were not looking for parks and trees  and\r\n\r\nplaygrounds: we were then looking for houses.  Now\r\n\r\nthat   the  houses  have  come,  the  demand   for\r\n\r\namenities has increased. Members of Parliament now\r\n\r\nmove  around  in cars, whereas before  they  moved\r\n\r\naround on bicycles! But they should not blame  the\r\n\r\nParks and Trees Division for any lack of amenities\r\n\r\nin  Housing  Board estates. Blame the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board if they like, but  let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  a  special  effort has been mounted  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh to plant more and more trees and shrubs.  In\r\n\r\nfact, quite a bit of ground has been reserved  for\r\n\r\na  park.  There  are  some  concrete  floors  laid\r\n\r\nbetween various blocks of flats, and these will be\r\n\r\nbroken  up  and trees planted, as in the  case  of\r\n\r\nrecreation  parks where cars are parked.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat in the course of this year Toa Payoh will  be\r\n\r\na better place to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, my Ministry is aware of the\r\n\r\nproblems brought up by both Members.
