Next, what is the\r\n\r\ncurrent state of the negotiations and what are  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the  proposed  Singapore   national\r\n\r\nairline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it has become common knowledge  that\r\n\r\nthe  policies and objectives of the Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysia towards Malaysia-Singapore\r\n\r\nAirlines  have  become divergent. Differences  have\r\n\r\narisen from time to time in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 2nd September, 1970, the Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the\r\n\r\nSingapore   High   Commission   in   Kuala   Lumpur\r\n\r\nrequesting the Singapore Government to designate  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  officials  to  discuss  with   their\r\n\r\ncommittee the creation of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Domestic Airline. On the 13th  November,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note in\r\n\r\nreply to the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore\r\n\r\nnominating this committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences of objectives between the two\r\n\r\nGovernments have become irreconcilable.  A  parting\r\n\r\nof  the  ways was unavoidable. Continuation of  the\r\n\r\npartnership   would  only  have  led  to   constant\r\n\r\nfriction and unnecessary conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government's interest is centred\r\n\r\nupon a fast-expanding commercially viable operation\r\n\r\nwith flights on international routes to Europe  and\r\n\r\nthe  United  States. The Malaysian  Government  has\r\n\r\ndifferent priorities. A major point of disagreement\r\n\r\nwas   the  proposal  to  expand  MSA  domestic  air\r\n\r\nservices   regardless  of  the  loss  forecast   by\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the decision has been taken to dissolve\r\n\r\nthe co-ownership and joint control of MSA, it is in\r\n\r\nthe  best  interests of both Governments  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed  restructuring of the  company  should  be\r\n\r\nproceeded with as expeditiously as possible.  There\r\n\r\nare  good  reasons for proceeding  with  deliberate\r\n\r\nspeed.  First,  in  the  airline  business  nothing\r\n\r\nstands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill. The transitional period before restructuring\r\n\r\nis  completed  is not conducive to  the  taking  of\r\n\r\nimportant  decisions on the expansion  of  services\r\n\r\nand  the  acquisition  of new  aircraft.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nstaff   of   the   company,  contractors,   agents,\r\n\r\nsuppliers   and   clients   would   find   a   long\r\n\r\ntransitional  period unsettling not  knowing  where\r\n\r\nexactly  they stand. Thirdly, Government  officials\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the  staff of MSA who are  directing,\r\n\r\nplanning and undertaking the arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of  the company  cannot  have  their\r\n\r\nattention distracted from their normal duties for a\r\n\r\nprolonged  period  of uncertainty and  restlessness\r\n\r\npending  the  final  hiving off into  two  separate\r\n\r\nairlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations between officials of the two\r\n\r\nGovernments   have  resulted  in   a   measure   of\r\n\r\nagreement. There are a few points on which  further\r\n\r\ntalks  are to take place. It has been agreed  that,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the restructuring will be completed by  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1972 or any earlier date that may be agreed\r\n\r\nupon  by  the two Governments; secondly,  that  the\r\n\r\nFokker aircraft will be transferred to the proposed\r\n\r\nMalaysian  national  airline  and  the  Boeing  707\r\n\r\naircraft   to   the  Singapore  national   airline;\r\n\r\nthirdly, that projects approved will be implemented\r\n\r\nand  that projects required for the orderly  growth\r\n\r\nand expansion of the company will not be held up on\r\n\r\naccount  of  the  proposed  restructuring  of   the\r\n\r\nairline.   The  Governments  have  also  appointed,\r\n\r\nthrough  MSA,  a  reputable firm of accountants  to\r\n\r\nvalue the assets, both tangible and intangible,  of\r\n\r\nthe company; the report of the accountants is to be\r\n\r\nsubmitted by 30th June this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has proposed that, to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  establishment  of  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nnational  airline, the internal operations  of  MSA\r\n\r\nshould  over  a  period of time be  separated,  and\r\n\r\nplaced  under the control of a \"Malaysian Division\"\r\n\r\nof the company. In the near future, such a Division\r\n\r\nwould  become the nucleus of the Malaysian national\r\n\r\nairline and would be handed over as such. It is the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the Singapore Government  that  this\r\n\r\ntransfer should take place as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  Singapore Government's intention  that\r\n\r\nthere   will   be  completely  separate   financial\r\n\r\naccountability  in  respect  of  domestic  services\r\n\r\nunder  the  Malaysian Government, and international\r\n\r\nservices  under the Singapore Government,  by  1st.\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1972, or that the national  airlines  of\r\n\r\nthe  two countries should be on their feet  by  the\r\n\r\n1st January, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have dealt with the distribution of the Fokker\r\n\r\nand  the  Boeing  707 aircraft, but  not  with  the\r\n\r\nBoeing  737  aircraft.  These  aircraft  are  used\r\n\r\nextensively  on  services  between  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia   as  well  as  on  international   routes\r\n\r\nstretching  to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Djakarta,  Bali\r\n\r\nand  Sumatra. Clearly, a sharing of these  aircraft\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be worked out on the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  interests of  each  Government.\r\n\r\nThis basis will be decided at separate negotiations\r\n\r\non an air services agreement which are scheduled to\r\n\r\nbe completely by the end of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate for me to outline the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Singapore national airline.  We  have\r\n\r\nconveyed to the Malaysian Government the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government will inherit the corporate\r\n\r\nentity  of  MSA  which  is; a Singapore  registered\r\n\r\ncompany, as was its precursor, Malayan Airways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should not be any hiatus in the rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  airline. Since the bulk  of  MSA's\r\n\r\ninternational  services are operated  on  Singapore\r\n\r\ntraffic rights and as a considerable proportion  of\r\n\r\ntraffic   originating  in  the   Singapore-Malaysia\r\n\r\nregion  is  derived  from Singapore,  the  proposed\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of the company will not  impair  its\r\n\r\ngrowth  prospects. MSA is now preparing a five-year\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan which, subject  to  scrutiny  and\r\n\r\napproval  by  the Government, will  be  implemented\r\n\r\nvigorously. I understand that consideration of  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  wide-bodied aircraft is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nhighlights of the plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment opportunities in a wholly- owned\r\n\r\nSingapore  company should grow at  a  rapid  rate.\r\n\r\nManagement  will  be given a free  and  unfettered\r\n\r\nhand  to  carry  out its tasks under the  effective\r\n\r\ncontrol and supervision of the Board of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectors.  With good management and  run  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of efficiency and profitability, our national\r\n\r\nairline  has  considerable growth expectations.  It\r\n\r\nshould  be  at least as profitable as and  probably\r\n\r\nlarger  than  Hong  Kong's airline.

Part-time teacher  training\r\n\r\nwill alleviate the present shortage of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of part-time teacher training over\r\n\r\nfull-time  training for student  teachers  is  that\r\n\r\nwhile undergoing training they will be able to earn\r\n\r\na salary which will help them economically, whereas\r\n\r\nin  the  case of full-time students, not  only  are\r\n\r\nthey  not paid a salary but they also have  to  pay\r\n\r\ntuition fees instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must appreciate the position of many school\r\n\r\nleavers  who do not come from well-to-do homes  and\r\n\r\nwho   would  like  to  earn  a  living  after   the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  their studies.  For  such  persons,\r\n\r\nwhile  they  may  not  take  on  full-time  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining  because  they  will  become  economically\r\n\r\ninactive when undergoing training, they may find it\r\n\r\nattractive enough to do part-time training and,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, earn a salary as trainee teachers in\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a partial solution to the problem of teacher\r\n\r\nshortage is the reintroduction of part-time teacher\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for the last three years I have been  harping\r\n\r\non the matter of substitute relief teachers without\r\n\r\nappearing to make much headway with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation. If I have harped on the subject over and\r\n\r\nover  again, it is because, having been  long  with\r\n\r\neducation  and  having children in school  who  are\r\n\r\nsometimes   taught   by  these  substitute   relief\r\n\r\nteachers, I sincerely believe that it is about time\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Education gradually  stopped\r\n\r\nits   existing   practice  of   using   unqualified\r\n\r\nyoungsters as relief teachers and made attempts  to\r\n\r\nreplace them with a corps of qualified teachers. It\r\n\r\nappears  that  the  number  of  unqualified  relief\r\n\r\nteachers increases year after year with no sign  of\r\n\r\nany   attempts  being  made  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  to  rectify  this,  to  say  the  least,\r\n\r\nunhappy   education  system.  The   provision   for\r\n\r\nsubstitute  relief teachers for  1969-70  was  $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion  for  15 months. The provision for  1970-71\r\n\r\nwas  $1.3  million. This year, as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  has  pointed out, the provision  is  $2.4\r\n\r\nmillion.  Can  the  Minister tell  the  House  what\r\n\r\nattempts  the  Ministry has made  to  rectify  this\r\n\r\nunhappy practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amongst the ranks of the relief teachers\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  who would want to  make  teaching\r\n\r\ntheir   career,   but  they  are  not   given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  or  the training to  become  qualified\r\n\r\nteachers.  Why  cannot  the best  of  these  relief\r\n\r\nteachers who wish to make teaching their career  be\r\n\r\ngiven  part-time  teacher  training,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nadvocated by the Member for Moulmein, so that  they\r\n\r\nwill  take  up teaching as a career and  not  as  a\r\n\r\nstepping  stone  to other jobs? What  we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget   is  that  the  backbone  of  our  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  today comprises teachers who  have  had\r\n\r\npart-time  teacher  training. There  are  many  who\r\n\r\nbecome daily-rated teachers today while waiting for\r\n\r\nsome  other employment. In any case, this  business\r\n\r\nof  unqualified  relief teachers  teaching  in  our\r\n\r\nschools is a bad reflection on our education policy\r\n\r\nand at the same time makes a mockery of teaching as\r\n\r\na profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to hear the Minister advance the practice of\r\n\r\nleave-taking  among teachers as a  reason  for  the\r\n\r\nneed  of  relief  teachers, it  would  appear  that\r\n\r\nteachers  have  never taken leave previously.  This\r\n\r\nis,  of  course, not true. Teachers  have  gone  on\r\n\r\nleave before. It is not a recent phenomenon, as was\r\n\r\npointed  out  earlier. But what really happened  in\r\n\r\nthose  good  old days, not more than four  or  five\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  was that there were one or  two  extra\r\n\r\nqualified  teachers in every school  to  take  over\r\n\r\nclasses  from  the  regular teachers  who  went  on\r\n\r\nleave.  But now with the quota of teachers  rigidly\r\n\r\nimposed  on  every school, there is the problem  of\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers who are unqualified to  take  over\r\n\r\nclasses  from the qualified teachers. As a  result,\r\n\r\nwe  have been relying on unqualified persons to act\r\n\r\nas  relief teachers. Sir, if there is a shortage of\r\n\r\nqualified teachers - and I believe there is - as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of some planning defect in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,  some  serious  attempts  must  be  made\r\n\r\nquickly  and  effectively to obviate  the  need  of\r\n\r\nusing  unqualified  people as  relief  teachers  in\r\n\r\nschools.  One  way  is to increase  the  output  of\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers.  The reason  for  regular  class\r\n\r\nteachers  to  be trained is equally  applicable  to\r\n\r\ntemporary relief teachers. The minds of the  future\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore are too precious an asset  to\r\n\r\nbe imperilled by improper teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has mentioned that the response\r\n\r\nto  advertisements  in respect  of  recruitment  of\r\n\r\nteachers was poor. Did the Ministry attempt to find\r\n\r\nout  the  reason for the lack of response from  our\r\n\r\nschool-leavers waiting for jobs? I can  advance  my\r\n\r\nown  reason,  but I will be accused of  harping  on\r\n\r\nsalaries  and working conditions all the time.  Let\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education advance their reasons for\r\n\r\nthe lack of response from qualified persons for not\r\n\r\nwanting  to  become teachers. Perhaps  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  advanced  by the Member for  Moulmein  may\r\n\r\nstand  up. Is it because teachers in training  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  for their training and, as a result,  they\r\n\r\nare not responding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice that this year the vote\r\n\r\nasked for in the General Education Department alone\r\n\r\nis  almost twice as much as that for last year.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the allocation will have to be more  if  we\r\n\r\ninclude  the  vocational institutes  and  technical\r\n\r\nschools in this particular vote. If the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  does  not make any serious  attempts  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation, I am sure that next year this\r\n\r\nvote  of  $2,400,000 that we are asked  to  approve\r\n\r\nthis  year will have to be doubled. When this sorry\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs is going to end will  be  a  big\r\n\r\nquestion  mark.  Sir, not very  long  ago  we  were\r\n\r\ntalking in terms of coming to the end of the  phase\r\n\r\nof  quantitative  education  and  launching  on  to\r\n\r\nqualitative education. May I humbly suggest that we\r\n\r\nhave not even arrived at this phase at all. A total\r\n\r\nof 99 per cent of our schools are still functioning\r\n\r\nas  two-session schools. The number of  classes  in\r\n\r\nschools has not been reduced; the number of  pupils\r\n\r\nper class has not been reduced; and the shortage of\r\n\r\nteachers has increased year after year. When can we\r\n\r\nhave  qualitative education at this rate? Sir,  all\r\n\r\npersons  who  are interested in education  and  who\r\n\r\nhave  children in school would want their  children\r\n\r\nand future citizens to be taught by persons who are\r\n\r\nteachers  by  training and by choice,  and  not  by\r\n\r\npersons who act as relief teachers for $7 or  $8  a\r\n\r\nday,  or  whatever the daily wage that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education pays them. So long as this phenomenon\r\n\r\nof   substitute  relief  teachers  exists  in   our\r\n\r\nschools,  we will have to remind the Minister  that\r\n\r\nit  has got to stop. Can the Minister for Education\r\n\r\ninform the House of any plans that the Ministry may\r\n\r\nhave  to overcome this educational problem that  we\r\n\r\nface?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, fortunately\r\n\r\nenough I have looked into the establishment  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  otherwise  after listening  to  the  two\r\n\r\nMembers  I would have thought that my Ministry  had\r\n\r\nbeen   staffed   completely  by  relief   teachers!\r\n\r\nActually,  only  five per cent of them  are  relief\r\n\r\nteachers, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  95 per cent consist of a hard  core  of\r\n\r\nfully competent teachers who are there by their own\r\n\r\nchoice.  I would like very much indeed to  see  all\r\n\r\none hundred per cent of the establishment filled by\r\n\r\npeople  who become teachers \"by their own  choice\",\r\n\r\nto quote the words of the Member for Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\nIt is because we do not have enough people who want\r\n\r\nto  join  the teaching service by their own  choice\r\n\r\nthat we are at present in this plight, and have  to\r\n\r\nresort  to engaging five per cent of the  staff  as\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers. The key words here are \"by  their\r\n\r\nown choice\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein.  I  am  very  glad indeed  that,  whether\r\n\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, he has advocated  the\r\n\r\npoint  which I have made about not proceeding  with\r\n\r\nthe setting up of the Institute of Education. It is\r\n\r\nprecisely because of the fear that I had of  having\r\n\r\ninsufficient  people  enrolling  to  pay   for   an\r\n\r\neducation  in order to be able to teach four  years\r\n\r\nlater  that I have had second thoughts, and he  has\r\n\r\nstated  it  correctly in this House that there  are\r\n\r\nlots of people who would prefer to learn while they\r\n\r\nwork.  The  question of whether we should institute\r\n\r\nfull-time  training  for these relief  teachers  is\r\n\r\nunder  consideration by my Ministry,  because  what\r\n\r\nstarted on an ad hoc basis looks as if it is  going\r\n\r\nto  become  a permanent feature in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, largely because - and I repeat  -  there\r\n\r\nare  insufficient people who would  opt  to  teach.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   we   are  seriously  considering   the\r\n\r\nproposition whether we should reintroduce part-time\r\n\r\ntraining.  But here again, may I point out  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  the  problem of sufficient  staff  to  teach\r\n\r\nthese relief teachers who will be going in for part-time  training.  This is a question  of  staff  and\r\n\r\nfacilities.  In  the same ways we would  very  much\r\n\r\nprefer, if we could, to have one-session schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore  right  through. We  are  prevented  from\r\n\r\ndoing  that  largely  because of  the  insufficient\r\n\r\nfacilities  for one-session schools. It means  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  almost  physically to double  the  school\r\n\r\nbuildings that we have now. For the information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Members,  when  I  attended  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nEducation   Ministers'   Conference   recently   in\r\n\r\nAustralia,  I  was surprised to find that  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  countries were very much interested  in\r\n\r\nour  two-session schools because, to  their  minds,\r\n\r\nthis feature represents the full utilisation of the\r\n\r\nresources at one's disposal. So while we  here  may\r\n\r\nthink that it is an unsatisfactory way to cram  all\r\n\r\nour students in the schools, others think it is one\r\n\r\nway of fully utilising one's resources. It could be\r\n\r\nthat  the  double-session school is a way  out  for\r\n\r\nmost  countries.  Maybe later on we  will  reach  a\r\n\r\nstate  of  affluence  and, with reclamation  making\r\n\r\ngood  progress  and  providing us  with  sufficient\r\n\r\nland,  we  may  be  able  to  build  single-session\r\n\r\nschools for all children going to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah and Moulmein are\r\n\r\nwondering why there is an increase in the vote  for\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers. As I have said, what has  started\r\n\r\non  an ad hoc basis is probably becoming permanent,\r\n\r\nbut  I  can tell them that my Ministry now is doing\r\n\r\nits  very best to relieve the situation. All I  can\r\n\r\npromise  is that things may get a little bit  worse\r\n\r\nbefore  they  get better, largely  because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties involved. It takes about  three  years\r\n\r\nat  least  to  train a teacher. If we start  making\r\n\r\nteaching  as a career more attractive or  enlarging\r\n\r\nthe  intake  of trainees in the Teacher's  Training\r\n\r\nCollege,  you will not see the result  until  three\r\n\r\nyears after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the measures taken by the Ministry to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem of shortage of  staff,  I  have\r\n\r\nfigures here to show that the intake of the  T.T.C.\r\n\r\nhas  been greatly increased. We expect 660 trainees\r\n\r\nto  qualify this year and 950 next year.  Thus  the\r\n\r\nintake  is increasing. Therefore, you can see  that\r\n\r\nrelief  is  on the way, and I hope the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah need not stand up again and say  that\r\n\r\nhe  has  been  at this problem for  the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in the workload, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this is due to the fact that we  are  also\r\n\r\nengaging graduates as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers. Unfortunately, there is a certain\r\n\r\nquota  to be observed with regard to the intake  of\r\n\r\ngraduates and T.T.C.-trained teachers. This may  be\r\n\r\ndue  to  financial considerations but it is largely\r\n\r\nbecause  the  professionals have  advised  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  maintain  a  certain proportion.  In  their\r\n\r\nview,  it  would not be realistic at this stage  of\r\n\r\nour development to have the full complement staffed\r\n\r\nwith graduate teachers. If Members want to know all\r\n\r\nthe  facts, they can refer to the professionals  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education, who are their colleagues\r\n\r\nor  ex-colleagues.  Anyway, I  completely  disagree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Telok Blangah when he said that\r\n\r\nwe have not succeeded in expanding quantitatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

My question was: when  can  we\r\n\r\nachieve  qualitative  education?  Not  quantitative\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Not overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are in the process of trying\r\n\r\nto achieve that, but there are many matters to look\r\n\r\ninto  now.  I think the Member is not unaware  that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a  curriculum  revision  in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry. There is a Department of Research looking\r\n\r\ninto  ways  and  means  of  improving  methods   of\r\n\r\nteaching.  We  have launched the  Educational  T.V.\r\n\r\nservice,  and  we are using all forms  of  aids  to\r\n\r\nreach the young minds. And improving the quality of\r\n\r\neducation is not an overnight process. It  takes  a\r\n\r\nlong  time and careful research. I would  say  that\r\n\r\nour circumstances here are different from those  in\r\n\r\nmost  other countries, because when we set  out  to\r\n\r\nachieve  multilingualism, or at least  bilingualism\r\n\r\nin the schools for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our  students,  it  was  not  just  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of learning two languages but  three.

The Institute of Education  does\r\n\r\nnot necessarily have to confine itself to full-time\r\n\r\nteacher  training,  as after all  there  are  other\r\n\r\nactivities  to  think of. And even if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreason to hold back full-time teacher training  and\r\n\r\npart-time  teacher training, it does not mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  must  also hold back the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nInstitute,  because, as I have said, the  Institute\r\n\r\nof  Education could incorporate so many other forms\r\n\r\nof  activity.  Anyway, the Minister has  said  that\r\n\r\nnext year over 600 trainees will pass out from  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C. and the following year another 900 trainees\r\n\r\nwill  qualify. The question I want to ask is  this:\r\n\r\nwill  all these teachers be given jobs? It must  be\r\n\r\nremembered  that much money has been spent  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining of these teachers. It has happened in  the\r\n\r\npast  that teacher-trainees who underwent  training\r\n\r\nand  obtained the Certificate of Education were not\r\n\r\nguaranteed  jobs, and I have pointed  this  out  in\r\n\r\nthis   House  previously.  This  is  one   of   the\r\n\r\ndisincentives  to this full-time teacher  training,\r\n\r\nand  therefore there is no response because,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that they do not earn  any  salary\r\n\r\nwhile  undergoing training, there is  no  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  they are going to get jobs at the end of  the\r\n\r\ncourse. So you can see the kind of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation  that the teacher training scheme  is  in\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is  this disincentive in  the  system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I just want to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nhe  can  give the assurance that all these teachers\r\n\r\nwill  be  given jobs when they pass  out  from  the T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I am not aware of any\r\n\r\nteaching institution in the world guaranteeing jobs\r\n\r\nfor its graduates.

The  amount allocated for the previous  year\r\n\r\nwas $10,500, but this has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced  to  $7,000 for  1971-72.  Activities\r\n\r\nunder   this   subhead  are  to  me  of  tremendous\r\n\r\neducational  value, and I should imagine  that  the\r\n\r\nvote should be increased rather than decreased,  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  really serious about pursuing  qualitative\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the \"Teachers' Seminar\", I\r\n\r\nwould like to draw the attention of Members to  the\r\n\r\nrecent Teachers' Seminar from 27th February to  1st\r\n\r\nMarch,  1971, organised by the Singapore  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion.  Some  250  teachers participated,  together\r\n\r\nwith representatives from the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nand  the  Teachers' Training College.  The  seminar\r\n\r\npapers, as well as the discussions, were guided  by\r\n\r\na  sense of proportional responsibility and realism\r\n\r\non the part of the participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the seminar papers, as well\r\n\r\nas   the   findings  of  the  seminar  on   various\r\n\r\nprofessional  problems of the teachers,  should  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  among  teachers  in  the  schools.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Teachers' Union, therefore,  intends  to\r\n\r\norganise group meetings of teachers on Saturdays to\r\n\r\nenable  as  many  teachers  as  possible  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious schools to benefit from the ideas contained\r\n\r\nin  the  seminar papers as well as the conclusions\r\n\r\nof  the  seminar. I would like to ask the Education\r\n\r\nMinister if he thinks that it will be a good  idea\r\n\r\nfor  the  Singapore Teachers' Union, the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  Research  Unit, the Inspectorate  of  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry  and  the  Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege jointly to organise meetings of teachers to\r\n\r\nenable  them to discuss their professional problems\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  establishing a larger  sense  of\r\n\r\ninvolvement  and  participation in the  educational\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore.  I  am  also  sure  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will agree with me that if Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools  are  asked  to  hold  seminars  or   group\r\n\r\nmeetings of teachers to discuss the educational and\r\n\r\nprofessional problems of teachers, this would be  a\r\n\r\nmuch more fruitful way for them to spend their time\r\n\r\nthan   going   around  snooping  and  investigating\r\n\r\ncomplaints from anonymous letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

In my own experience, I find them  to  be\r\n\r\nvery useful, but perhaps more use could be found at\r\n\r\ndistrict level. In other words, the organisation of\r\n\r\nthese  educational seminars, which  at  present  is\r\n\r\nconfined  only  to  the central  level,  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought lower down to the district level, so that a\r\n\r\nnumber  of schools could come together and join  in\r\n\r\nthese   discussions,  and  maintain  a   continuing\r\n\r\ndiscussion of their role in relation to society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Ministry  of  Education  could   give\r\n\r\nteachers  a  feedback as to what it thinks  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  that  have  been  formulated  at   these\r\n\r\nseminars.

What happened was that  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of $10,500 for the  financial  year\r\n\r\nwhich is about to end, there was included a sum  of\r\n\r\n$5,000 for guidance and placement. But this sum has\r\n\r\nnow  been transferred to the vote for the Technical\r\n\r\nEducation  Department. Therefore,  though  the  sum\r\n\r\nasked for is $7,000, there is, in fact, an increase\r\n\r\nof  $1,500 in the provision.

It is also  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  creating  a national cultural image.  It  must\r\n\r\ninculcate  in  our  people  a  sense  of   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and patriotism. It must  enrich  the\r\n\r\nlife   of   our   people  with   healthy   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.  It  also  has  the  duty  of  imposing\r\n\r\ncensorship  on publications and books in  order  to\r\n\r\nremove  any material that may poison the  minds  of\r\n\r\nour people and to ensure that they obtain a healthy\r\n\r\nmental pabulum. I have received complaints that in\r\n\r\nrecent months chain picture books have flooded  our\r\n\r\nmarkets. The contents of these chain picture  books\r\n\r\nare  full  of  fantasy. They contain  mythical  and\r\n\r\npornographic material which adversely  affects  the\r\n\r\nchildren of this country. These children read these\r\n\r\nundesirable  picture books and, as a result,  their\r\n\r\nstudies are adversely affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a matter of grave concern to us. It is my view that the civil servants in the Ministry of Culture have failed in their duty. I hope that the Minister will take the necessary action to ban all these fantastic, mythical and pornographic picture books, so that\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of our young children are not  poisoned\r\n\r\nbecause they are the future leaders of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I wish to talk about television. At the\r\n\r\nmoment  television  has  many  viewers.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhether the programmes are good or bad, they have a\r\n\r\ngreat  influence on the people. There is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  in  the past one year we have seen many  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes on T.V. They include forums and  debates\r\n\r\non social and economic problems. These are all very\r\n\r\neducational.   However,  there   are   a   lot   of\r\n\r\nshortcomings in the light entertainment  programme.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the Chinese variety show produced  by\r\n\r\nR.T.S. has  no  educational value.  The  programme\r\n\r\nconsists of nothing more than showing men and women\r\n\r\nin  love  and  stories of jilted love. The  singers\r\n\r\nalways sing, \"I don't want to go home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntonight.\"  All  the items in the programme  are  in\r\n\r\nvery  low  taste.  They give our young  people  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of funny ideas. I cannot see any educational\r\n\r\nvalue in such a programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of films shown on T.V., I regret\r\n\r\nto  say  that  most of the actors and actresses  in\r\n\r\nthese films are already dead and gone. In fact, the\r\n\r\npictures are too old for screening. It is  my  hope\r\n\r\nthat  such nauseating programmes will not be  shown\r\n\r\nagain on T.V. We should not show pictures which are\r\n\r\nmore  than ten years old. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nsee to it that some improvement is made in the T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  especially those relating to  culture.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  concerts or  variety  shows  can  be\r\n\r\nproduced  by  inviting students  from  the  various\r\n\r\nlanguage streams, the universities and institutions\r\n\r\nof  higher  learning. I am sure that some  students\r\n\r\nare  able  to  produce good and healthy programmes.\r\n\r\nThey already have their choirs. They can sing, blow\r\n\r\nthe  harmonica, put up plays, give piano  recitals,\r\n\r\nand  even recite poetry. These programmes are  very\r\n\r\npopular with our people. I am sure the public  will\r\n\r\nbe  very happy and welcome them. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nR.T.S. will be able to nurture a new generation  of\r\n\r\nartistes. It can kill two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our able Minister for Culture has always emphasised the importance of creating healthy culture and art. He has also stressed that good cultural traditions should be encouraged. I endorse his views without any reservation. But the important thing is this. His Ministry does not\r\n\r\nappear  to  be following this policy. It  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide good educational programmes for the benefit\r\n\r\nof   our  people  in  consonance  with  the  policy\r\n\r\npronounced by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to discuss the question of\r\n\r\nhow  to promote healthy cultural activities. I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  at the beginning of my speech  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  has  the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping   our   national   arts   and   culture.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the past one year the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture has done very little in this direction.  At\r\n\r\nthe very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmost, it held a talentime contest on T.V. and  some\r\n\r\nart  exhibitions.  I  would,  therefore,  like   to\r\n\r\npropose to the Ministry of Culture that in order to\r\n\r\ndevelop our national culture and inculcate a  sense\r\n\r\nof  national consciousness in our people, it should\r\n\r\ntake   the  responsibility  of  promoting   healthy\r\n\r\ncultural activities. It should lay down a policy on\r\n\r\nculture   and   art   so  as  to  encourage   their\r\n\r\ndevelopment and bring about a flourishing  national\r\n\r\nculture and art in Singapore. I would like to  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to propose to the  Minister  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be a cultural festival  on  a  large\r\n\r\nscale  this year. All the cultural and art  workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore can then participate in it.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  they can not only show their culture but also\r\n\r\nlearn  from  the others. At the same time,  we  can\r\n\r\nalso  give  proper encouragement to our  people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  to  bring about a healthy  cultural\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  a socio-cultural condition which,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,   the   Minister  will  agree   prevails   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  May I refer to the problem arising  out\r\n\r\nof  this  condition as the problem of two cultures?\r\n\r\nThis  is no hackneyed phrase, I hope, because  this\r\n\r\nproblem of two cultures has nothing to do with  the\r\n\r\ncelebrated problem once elaborated by C.  P.  Snow.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our  own  problem and  relates  to  a  non-convergence  in  certain  important  attitudes  and\r\n\r\ncharacteristic  modes  of  thinking  between  those\r\n\r\neducated  in the English medium and those  educated\r\n\r\nin the Chinese medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a certain amount of animated,\r\n\r\nperhaps   even  agitated,  discussion  in   English\r\n\r\nnewspapers    on    the    necessity    for    film\r\n\r\nclassification.  While this was  going  on  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish papers, the Chinese newspapers did not seem\r\n\r\nto  evince  the slightest interest. Any  comparison\r\n\r\nbetween  the  respective themes in the \"Letters  to\r\n\r\nthe  Editor\"  in the Chinese press and the  English\r\n\r\npress  will  indicate  that the  preoccupations  of\r\n\r\nthose  people  who read the English papers  differ,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps radically, from the preoccupations  of\r\n\r\nthose who read the Chinese newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Minister   has  himself  remarked   on   this\r\n\r\nphenomenon. I think one has to see this  difference\r\n\r\ninitially and in its correct perspective,  in  view\r\n\r\nalso of the various remarks made by the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  who  has  spoken of the  propagation  of\r\n\r\nhealthy cultural traditions and a national culture.\r\n\r\nI   speak  in  the  same  way  as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,   but  perhaps  what  I  think   of   as\r\n\r\npropagation  of  healthy  cultural  traditions  and\r\n\r\nnational  culture may be different  from  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang thinks in terms of a  healthy\r\n\r\ncultural  tradition. I think this  point  is  worth\r\n\r\nmaking  and it is worth while getting us to realise\r\n\r\nit. Now, having made the point, I must say that our\r\n\r\npeople are basically tolerant. I think there  is  a\r\n\r\nbasic subscription to the importance of respect for\r\n\r\none  another's  ways of living and  behaviour.  And\r\n\r\ncertainly  the Government must take  credit  for  a\r\n\r\npolicy  that has resulted in this sort  of  respect\r\n\r\nand  tolerance. Where the Ministry  of  Culture  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  its  attitude in respect  of  a  multi-cultural   development  up  till   now   has   been\r\n\r\napparently to contrive the maximum exposure of  the\r\n\r\ncultural  aspects of one group for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nother groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think exposure alone is not enough. For example, it is not enough to put on a programme like \"Tapestry\" - and I am quoting this only as an example - incorporating the dances and music of the various cultural streams for the delectation of all. This is what I mean by\r\n\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we attend a school concert or a cultural\r\n\r\npresentation organised by some community or even  a\r\n\r\ncommunal organisation, there is this exposure.  And\r\n\r\ncertainly all this exposure is good. But as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it is not enough. What the next step  should\r\n\r\nbe,  I think, is to provide a deeper experience  of\r\n\r\none  another's  cultural ways. One approach  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities whereby one  may  acquire  a\r\n\r\nmore analytical awareness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the characteristics of the other person's\r\n\r\nculture. Where culture in the sense of dance, song,\r\n\r\nart,  music is concerned, we could have programmes,\r\n\r\nwhich teach an understanding of these things,  both\r\n\r\nin  a language which is a fairly common medium like\r\n\r\nEnglish  and in a medium different from that  which\r\n\r\nis a characteristic of the culture to be presented.\r\n\r\nIn   other   words,  if  you  put  on   a   Chinese\r\n\r\npresentation, let us find out all about  the  finer\r\n\r\naspects  of this presentation in English, Malay  or\r\n\r\nTamil. Let there be explanations. Let there  be  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  attempt to teach  the  finer  and  the\r\n\r\ndeeper aspects of this culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember once seeing on television what\r\n\r\nappeared to be an interesting and detailed  account\r\n\r\nof  the basic characteristics of Indian dance.  But\r\n\r\nthe  programme was in Tamil. I would have liked  to\r\n\r\nappreciate  the programme myself. But I  could  not\r\n\r\nbecause  the medium of explanation was Tamil.  That\r\n\r\nparticular programme should have been in Chinese or\r\n\r\nEnglish as well. There does not appear to be enough\r\n\r\nof  education  of one sector of the people  to  the\r\n\r\ncultural  forms of other sectors through  our  mass\r\n\r\nmedia. That is with respect to culture in the  art,\r\n\r\nmusic, or dance aspect of the term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to culture in the sense of outlook\r\n\r\nand ways of thinking and behaving, it may be a good\r\n\r\nidea  for newspapers to select items that  seem  to\r\n\r\nreflect characteristically the attitudes of  people\r\n\r\nwho   read  newspapers  in  a  certain  medium  and\r\n\r\nreproduce   these   characteristic,   idiosyncratic\r\n\r\nnotions  in  a  paper  using  another  medium.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  English newspapers could  scrutinise\r\n\r\nthose  characteristic reflections  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\npapers  and  reproduce  these  reflections  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  newspapers and vice versa. And  this  goes\r\n\r\nfor  the Malay and Tamil press too. Indeed our T.V.\r\n\r\nand  radio  could  do this sort of  thing  with  or\r\n\r\nwithout  comment.

The\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre  Trust,  under  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture,   is  responsible  for  certain   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and  cultural  work.  And   they   have\r\n\r\norganised  some  orchestras and dance  troupes.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, the National Theatre is more or  less\r\n\r\nan institute of performing arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, to train an orchestra, a choir or\r\n\r\na  dance  troupe to a certain standard  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  task  indeed. It is much more  difficult\r\n\r\nthan training a violinist or a pianist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre has a modern stage of\r\n\r\nconsiderable  size and the National  Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nhas  many  able  conductors and dance  instructors.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  pre-requisites necessary  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining   of  members  of  orchestras  and   dance\r\n\r\ntroupes. Endowed with such facilities, it is a pity\r\n\r\nthat  the  National Theatre Trust  is  experiencing\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties.  As  a  result,  all   the\r\n\r\nfacilities that are at its disposal cannot be fully\r\n\r\nexploited.  If  we  view  this  problem  from  this\r\n\r\nperspective, we would feel a great deal of pity and\r\n\r\nsympathy for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Trust which must not be allowed to\r\n\r\ndie because of financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember some time early this year I read\r\n\r\nin  the  newspapers that the Australian  Government\r\n\r\nhad  extended to us an invitation to send a mission\r\n\r\nto  attend the Adelaide Cultural Festival. At  that\r\n\r\ntime, a spokesman from the Ministry of Culture said\r\n\r\nthat  it was a great honour for Singapore that such\r\n\r\nan invitation had been extended to us. He also said\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Culture would do all it could\r\n\r\nto  accomplish the mission. This is, of  course,  a\r\n\r\nmatter   which  we  should  be  very  happy  about.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,  Sir,  the  best  item  that  we  could\r\n\r\ncontribute   to  such  an  international   cultural\r\n\r\nfestival  would  be  to send a  mission  comprising\r\n\r\nChinese   orchestra,  the  Philharmonic  Orchestra,\r\n\r\nlocal  dance  troupes and choirs.  Such  a  mission\r\n\r\nwould be able to reflect the characteristics of our\r\n\r\nmulti-culture. If this invitation had been  handled\r\n\r\nby the National Theatre, I am sure the result would\r\n\r\nbe   very  good.  But  unfortunately  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  is  unable  to  do  anything  because   of\r\n\r\nfinancial    difficulties.   Even    the    present\r\n\r\nPhilharmonic  Orchestra  and  dance  troupes   have\r\n\r\nalready ceased their activities at the moment.  The\r\n\r\nremaining  organisations that are still active  are\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese orchestra and the choir. And even they\r\n\r\nare  in  a very precarious position. They  are  not\r\n\r\nable  to do what they can for the country.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture cannot give adequate financial\r\n\r\nassistance  or encouragement to the orchestras  and\r\n\r\ndance troupes, how can we expect them to contribute\r\n\r\nto the cultural life of our country? As a matter of\r\n\r\nfact,  in  my  view, the various orchestras,  dance\r\n\r\ntroupes  and choirs in the National Theatre  should\r\n\r\nbe  regarded  as a cultural army representative  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We should therefore, in all seriousness,\r\n\r\ngive   them  proper  training,  encouragement   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance. Whether it is a philharmonic\r\n\r\norchestra or a Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norchestra or any dance troupe, they should be given\r\n\r\nproper training opportunities and facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wish to deal with is in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the  treatment  of  the   various\r\n\r\norchestras  and  dance  troupes  in  the   National\r\n\r\nTheatre.  There has been some injustice or  unequal\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  certain ways. I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Culture  is   aware   of   certain\r\n\r\ndiscrimination existing in the National Theatre. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know, members of the Chinese  orchestra\r\n\r\nreceive  different  treatment  from  those  in  the\r\n\r\nPhilharmonic  Orchestra. I am given  to  understand\r\n\r\nthat the reason is that members of the Philharmonic\r\n\r\nOrchestra  have  passed  certain  examinations  and\r\n\r\nobtained certain qualifications, and therefore they\r\n\r\nare  given better treatment and emoluments. In  the\r\n\r\ncase of the members of the Chinese orchestra, there\r\n\r\nhave    been    no   examinations,   no    official\r\n\r\nqualifications,  and so their  salaries  should  be\r\n\r\nlower. Sir, in my view, this is unreasonable. As we\r\n\r\nknow,  the  Chinese orchestra has  its  origins  in\r\n\r\nChina.  But  in China there is no proper  institute\r\n\r\nfor  the  training of musicians. This  is  done  by\r\n\r\nthose who have a liking for Chinese music under the\r\n\r\nguidance  of experienced players. After  that,  the\r\n\r\ntrainees  themselves  will have  to  practise  hard\r\n\r\nbefore   they   can  be  anywhere   near   success.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it takes a very long time and plenty  of\r\n\r\npractice  and  energy to train a Chinese  musician.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  Chinese  saying,  in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of Chinese musical instruments,  that  it\r\n\r\ntakes  1,000 days to learn the pi pa,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  flute; 100 days to learn the ku  chern,  a\r\n\r\nChinese  harp;  and more than half  a  lifetime  to\r\n\r\nlearn a three-stringed instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, are you going to speak on\r\n\r\nthis amendment which refers to subhead 1001?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto speak on amendment (3) * which stands in my name,\r\n\r\nfor  what I am going to say is related to what  has\r\n\r\nbeen said by the Members who have spoken just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1211.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you going to repeat what they\r\n\r\nhave said?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  their views, but I have my own  points  to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sign of daybreak we can hear music\r\n\r\nbroadcast over the radio. Of course, music is meant\r\n\r\nto  soothe  our mind and body, and to provide  some\r\n\r\nentertainment  for  us. More  important,  music  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to lift up our spirit and to stimulate  a\r\n\r\ngreater sense of one's upward orientation. I regret\r\n\r\nto  note  that  what  we are  subject  to  nowadays\r\n\r\nconsists  merely of an unhealthy and decadent  type\r\n\r\nof music. Although we are awake, after listening to\r\n\r\nthis kind of music we become drowsy again. How  can\r\n\r\nwe  be roused to work in this mood? This is what we\r\n\r\nare  subject  to  at home. If we go  out  into  the\r\n\r\nstreet  we  can  hear music of  the  unhealthy  and\r\n\r\nsickly  type, music which consists of  nothing  but\r\n\r\nshrieking, screaming and shouting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us share this feeling. When foreign\r\n\r\nsingers  come to Singapore and sing pop  songs  and\r\n\r\ndance  in  the latest style, our audiences  blindly\r\n\r\nfollow  them and popularise their songs and dances.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  we put on a serious concert  or  show\r\n\r\nwith  classical  music or art  songs,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to sell even a small number  of  tickets\r\n\r\nand  those who buy them merely do so to oblige  the\r\n\r\norganisers. For the last few years the youth of our\r\n\r\ncountry  have  been  exposed  to  influences   from\r\n\r\nforeign countries. Many of them have taken  up  the\r\n\r\nsongs  of  the  Beatles and their  dances  and  the\r\n\r\nWestern soul-dance. The men keep long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhair,  wear  a  long beard, and sport bell-bottoms.\r\n\r\nThe  girls  wear  jeans. It is  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between the males and the females. Most\r\n\r\nof   them  are  like  hippies.  This  is   a   most\r\n\r\nundesirable  tendency. It corrupts the  body,  mind\r\n\r\nand spirit of our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reasons for this tendency are, firstly,\r\n\r\nexternal influence; secondly, imitation from films;\r\n\r\nthirdly,  what  they learn over the  Radio  and  on\r\n\r\nT.V.; and, fourthly, what they learn from books and\r\n\r\nmagazines.  If  we  look at  our  newspapers,  what\r\n\r\ncatches  our eyes consists of publicity stunts  and\r\n\r\npropaganda  for  singers,  film  stars,   fashions,\r\n\r\nhairstyles, entertainment and such like. Newspapers\r\n\r\nare  full  of sensational stories like  murders  of\r\n\r\npassion and revenge. All these are meant to  arouse\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of the readers and to  increase  the\r\n\r\ncirculation  of the newspapers. But  have  we  ever\r\n\r\npaid  attention  to the ill effects or  undesirable\r\n\r\ninfluence of such stories of sex and violence?  The\r\n\r\nnewspapers  even  show  bloody  scenes  of  murders\r\n\r\ndescribed  in  the fullest detail. Have  they  ever\r\n\r\nthought  what sort of influence or effect  this  is\r\n\r\ngoing to have on our youth? The small bookstalls in\r\n\r\nthe  backlanes  and street corners stock  unhealthy\r\n\r\nstories   of  passion  or  violence  and  low-class\r\n\r\ncomics. This is all bad for our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, films are a popular medium\r\n\r\nof entertainment. If we want to know how many  healthy \r\n\r\nor  useful films we had last year, the result  \r\n\r\nwill be  most  disappointing. All the films  shown  \r\n\r\nlast year   were  about  soldiers,  cowboys,   sex   \r\n\r\nand violence.  I suggest that the Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\ncarry  out a comprehensive review of this so-called\r\n\r\n\"culture\" of our country. We should not allow films\r\n\r\nto be shown if they portray violence and mysticism,\r\n\r\nparticularly because they will adversely affect the\r\n\r\nminds and bodies of our youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand some of these foreign singers can earn\r\n\r\nas much as $2,500 by performing just one show. This\r\n\r\nhas  been  given wide publicity in our  newspapers.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of impression is this going to create? If\r\n\r\nwe look at our own situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  we try to publish a healthy magazine or  book,\r\n\r\nit  is very difficult to sell even 2,000 copies. Is\r\n\r\nit because our people do not possess the ability to\r\n\r\nread  that  they  do not like to  read,  or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the  interest  of  our  readers  has  been\r\n\r\nchannelled into other directions? If the answer  is\r\n\r\nthe former, it is sad. If the answer is the latter,\r\n\r\nI  think the Ministry of Culture should quickly  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it. If we can ban advertisements on\r\n\r\ncigarettes,  why  cannot  we  ban  those  unhealthy\r\n\r\npublications  and advertisements which  will  lower\r\n\r\nthe  morals and adversely affect the minds  of  our\r\n\r\nyouths?  We are now in the initial stage of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  we  should therefore  cultivate  the\r\n\r\nqualities of our youths. Is this not a step in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction? If necessary, I think  we  should\r\n\r\nimpose  a  \"cultural quota system\"  and  we  should\r\n\r\nleave   out  those  publications  which   are   not\r\n\r\nnecessary  or  of pressing need to  us.  We  should\r\n\r\nencourage  local writers and artistes  to  be  more\r\n\r\nproductive.  At  the  same time,  we  can  organise\r\n\r\nsomething like a cultural centre and employ  people\r\n\r\nwho  specialise or are experienced in the arts  and\r\n\r\nculture and those who are interested in the various\r\n\r\nfields  of our arts to work for the cause. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  good idea to draw up a programme of the work\r\n\r\nto  be  done as an immediate requirement or put  up\r\n\r\none  or two concerts or shows a month. I think  all\r\n\r\nthese will be of help and benefit to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to criticise T.V.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  programmes which I  consider  are  not\r\n\r\nsuited  to  our country. I refer to the  Pesta  Pop\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in which are featured crazy dances  and\r\n\r\nRed  Indian dances. Watching these dances  we  feel\r\n\r\nourselves  to be in a jungle with Red  Indians  who\r\n\r\nare  isolated  from the world of  progress. Is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  satisfied  with  such  dances?  Does   he\r\n\r\nconsider that they reflect cultural advancement for\r\n\r\nour country? Do such dance programmes deserve to be\r\n\r\ntelecast  on our T.V. Singapore? If we look  around\r\n\r\nus,  we will find there is an abundance of national\r\n\r\ndances which we can tap from our multi-racial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  and which should be appropriately  telecast\r\n\r\non  T.V.  Singapore.  But why  are  these  national\r\n\r\ndances  completely ignored? Can  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of this cultural gap\r\n\r\nis  a very complex one, and it is even reflected in\r\n\r\nthis House. On the one hand, we have Members asking\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  liberal attitude towards  censorship,\r\n\r\nand,  on  the other, we have Members asking  for  a\r\n\r\nstricter  censorship on films,  to  cut  out  films\r\n\r\nshowing  girls' bare bosoms and to stop  using  pop\r\n\r\nsongs  in  the  variety shows  on  T.V.  They  have\r\n\r\nsuggested that, instead, we should only have  piano\r\n\r\nrecitals  and cultural dances. So this  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncomplex  problem.  I  think we  will  be  deceiving\r\n\r\nourselves if we say that a simple and easy solution\r\n\r\nfor it can be found overnight. This has come to our\r\n\r\nnotice only recently after more and more of us have\r\n\r\nbecome  bilingual and begun to move from one  group\r\n\r\nto  another.  In  the past we always  thought  that\r\n\r\ndifferences in tastes, in outlook and in the way we\r\n\r\nlook  at  life  existed only  among  the  different\r\n\r\nracial  groups,  and  we  felt  that  if  we  could\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  common  language  so  that  we  could\r\n\r\ncommunicate with one another, the problem would  be\r\n\r\nhalf  solved. However, this is not to be the  case.\r\n\r\nWe  have  now found that even among people  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  race  but  coming from different  educational\r\n\r\nstreams, there exist differences in tastes, in  the\r\n\r\nway  they  look at life and in what they understand\r\n\r\nto  be  their responsibilities towards  society.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that this has something to do with the  way\r\n\r\none  is brought up, the kind of friends one has and\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of books and newspapers one  reads.  All\r\n\r\nthese  factors  tend to pull our people  apart  and\r\n\r\nconfine  them in different compartments. A  vicious\r\n\r\ncircle is therefore formed. If a person is educated\r\n\r\nin,  say,  the English stream, he reads merely  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  newspapers  which  emphasise  subjects  of\r\n\r\ninterest only to the English-educated group.  After\r\n\r\nsome time he is conditioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  certain  fixed  views which  only  he  and  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated group hold. He begins to adopt the\r\n\r\noutlook  which  is  typical of that  group.  So  he\r\n\r\ncloses  his  mind to things which are happening  in\r\n\r\nthe  other  groups. The same thing happens  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers  which, amongst  other  things,\r\n\r\nconstantly  remind their readers of their  glorious\r\n\r\npast -four thousand years of history and so on, and\r\n\r\nof the importance of not giving in to the influence\r\n\r\nof  western decadent culture. This brings  about  a\r\n\r\npolarisation of views between the two groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting thing for us to do here is to\r\n\r\nwatch  how  different newspapers play up  different\r\n\r\nthings.  Take,  for  instance,  the  story  of  the\r\n\r\nshooting  of  monkeys in the Botanic  Gardens.  The\r\n\r\nEnglish newspapers splashed the story on the  front\r\n\r\npage,  with follow-up stories of demonstration,  by\r\n\r\nsome students, presumably from the English schools,\r\n\r\nagainst  the  shooting of these  monkeys.  But  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers laughed their heads  off.  They\r\n\r\nthought the whole thing was very funny, that it was\r\n\r\nridiculous.  They laughed at the stupidity  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  press for playing up such a  story.  Their\r\n\r\nimmediate reaction was: Chih pao fan mei  yiu  shih\r\n\r\nching  tsuo.  To  express it in English  is  a  bit\r\n\r\ndifficult,  but it means something like this:  they\r\n\r\nare too well fed, so much so that they have nothing\r\n\r\nto  help them digest their food; they therefore had\r\n\r\nto  play  up  this story as a pastime. The  Chinese\r\n\r\npress asked, \"Why waste time and valuable space  on\r\n\r\nthis story of monkeys? Why do they not think of the\r\n\r\nthousands of human beings being shot in Vietnam  by\r\n\r\nweapons far more deadly than those used against the\r\n\r\nmonkeys in Singapore?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the way the different language\r\n\r\nnewspapers report the debates in this House. A  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago  the  English newspapers played  up  only\r\n\r\nthose  speeches  of Members who spoke  in  English.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Chinese papers only picked up  those\r\n\r\nspeeches  delivered  in  Chinese.  Presumably  some\r\n\r\nMembers must have cyclostyled their speeches and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistributed  them  to the Chinese  newspapers,  for\r\n\r\nthey printed them in full, every word of it without\r\n\r\nany editing. This is the way things go. But I think\r\n\r\nwe  will be deceiving ourselves if we say that this\r\n\r\nproblem can be solved very quickly. We have so  far\r\n\r\nonly diagnosed the symptoms, but I think we are far\r\n\r\nfrom finding a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presenting cultural shows in the different\r\n\r\nlanguage    media,    with    interpretation    and\r\n\r\nexplanation, might be a help, but I doubt very much\r\n\r\nthey  will, because cultural dances and  shows  are\r\n\r\nonly staged very occasionally. We need to look into\r\n\r\nother  fields, like the newspapers, to see  whether\r\n\r\nthey  should also play a role in bridging the  gap,\r\n\r\nso to speak, between the different cultural groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar spoke about the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre. The National Theatre  Trust  has\r\n\r\ndone  a  very  commendable job in the promotion  of\r\n\r\ncultural activities. This is even more evident when\r\n\r\nwe  consider the fact that since the time the Trust\r\n\r\nwas  formed,  not a single cent has been  voted  in\r\n\r\nParliament  to subsidise it. Nevertheless,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen   able   to  raise  from  scratch  a   Chinese\r\n\r\norchestra,  a  choir and a symphony orchestra,  and\r\n\r\ntogether  they  have staged many fine performances.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 they conducted 14 indoor concerts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have one minute left, Mr Jek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that\r\n\r\nmany  Members will be withdrawing their amendments,\r\n\r\nI  wonder if we can lift Standing Orders to  enable\r\n\r\nme  to  give  them a more detailed  reply  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us see what the response is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I interrupt\r\n\r\nbriefly?

So in spite\r\n\r\nof  the  fact that the National Theatre Trust  have\r\n\r\nnot  received a single cent from this House in  the\r\n\r\nway  of direct subsidy, they have been able to form\r\n\r\nvery good cultural groups in the Theatre. This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made possible by the hard work and dedication\r\n\r\nof  the  Trust members and the artistes  concerned,\r\n\r\nand also by the generous donations from the public.\r\n\r\nBut  I think this state of affairs cannot last very\r\n\r\nlong.  The members of the Trust are tired of  going\r\n\r\nout  now  and  then to ask for donations  from  the\r\n\r\npublic for the National Theatre. In fact, the  time\r\n\r\nhas  come  for  us to ask this House for  money  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the cultural activities of the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Trust.  We  must realise  that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect to promote the fine arts for nothing. If  we\r\n\r\nthink  that these cultural shows are good  and  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  our  gracious living,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay  for them. We  want  to  pay  our\r\n\r\nartistes  as  much as we can, and as much  as  they\r\n\r\ndeserve.  But  as  I have said,  due  to  financial\r\n\r\nlimitations, we are not able to do so.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible   to  pay  each  member  of  the   Chinese\r\n\r\norchestra  more than $40 per month, but members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore National Symphony Orchestra are paid\r\n\r\nhigher  rates of honorarium because the  rates  are\r\n\r\nlaid down by the Musicians' Union of Singapore,  of\r\n\r\nwhich many of them are members. The honoraria  paid\r\n\r\nto  members of the Chinese orchestra are lower than\r\n\r\nthe  rates  laid  down by the Musicians'  Union  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and also lower than the fees paid by the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department. Therefore,  I  am  giving\r\n\r\nvery   serious   consideration  to  the   financial\r\n\r\nposition of the National Theatre Trust as  a  whole\r\n\r\nwith a view to ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Point of order, Sir, I cannot hear\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Some Backbenchers are having a\r\n\r\nprivate conversation among themselves, and I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  interfering with the  Minister's  speech.\r\n\r\nWill you carry on, Mr Jek?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> As to the healthy cultural\r\n\r\nactivities referred to by the Member for Sembawang,\r\n\r\nalthough  I  do not fully agree with  what  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  we will look into it. Of course, we need  to\r\n\r\nhave some entertaining programmes on television  as\r\n\r\nwell as over the radio. We cannot only have what he\r\n\r\ncalls   educational   programmes.   If   he   wants\r\n\r\neducational  programmes, or if he is interested  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  education,  then  he  should  switch  to\r\n\r\nE.T.V. But there are also good programmes on  T.V.,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  documentaries, music, and other  cultural\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  If  we  were to  accept  the  Member's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  we should wipe out  all  the  pop\r\n\r\nsongs  and the more popular programmes on T.V.,  we\r\n\r\nwould  end  up with nothing at all. I am afraid  we\r\n\r\ncannot do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other point about holding a cultural\r\n\r\nfestival  in  Singapore,  I  think  this  is  worth\r\n\r\nlooking into, and I am definitely going to give  it\r\n\r\nvery  serious  thought.  But  if  I  am  right   in\r\n\r\ninterpreting  what  he  has  said  just  now  about\r\n\r\ncultural  activities,  that  they  refer  to   free\r\n\r\ncultural  shows  in the open air,  like  the  Aneka\r\n\r\nRagam we had in the old days, then I would say that\r\n\r\nthose  days  are gone, because since then  we  have\r\n\r\nbecome  more  sophisticated. Instead of  performing\r\n\r\ntheir  shows in the open air, the artistes are  now\r\n\r\ninvited  to  perform in our T.V. studios,  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir  shows  can  be enjoyed not  only  by  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand people, as in the case of open air  shows,\r\n\r\nbut  by  hundreds of thousands of T.V. viewers.

It is admitted that the\r\n\r\nPesta  Pop  programme is produced in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and therefore we should have more  Malay\r\n\r\nfolk  dances in the programme. But it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to confine this programme  to  Malay\r\n\r\nfolk  dances  only. It is meant to  cater  for  the\r\n\r\ntastes  of  everyone, although more  Malay  viewers\r\n\r\nenjoy  this  programme.

As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, we do not know whether or not it is\r\n\r\nreally a Red Indian dance.

However, on the  question  of\r\n\r\nbooks  imported from abroad, they are censored.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this does not necessarily mean that  every\r\n\r\nbook must go through censorship. Perhaps some hooks\r\n\r\nmay have escaped the net or there may be some books\r\n\r\nsent  by  post.  We cannot carry out censorship  on\r\n\r\nbooks  sent  by parcel post too strictly.  In  our\r\n\r\nsystem  of  censorship, other than in the  case  of\r\n\r\nundesirable publications, we have tried to adopt  a\r\n\r\nliberal policy so that the people of Singapore  can\r\n\r\nread various kinds of books, particularly those  in\r\n\r\ngood  taste.  Of course, we will pay  attention  to\r\n\r\ncensorship. We have set certain standards in regard\r\n\r\nto  books,  particularly those  relating  to  chain\r\n\r\npicture comic books which depict violence and  sex.\r\n\r\nWe  have laid down certain criteria by which we  do\r\n\r\nnot allow such books to be imported into Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, Singapore is a centre of communications in\r\n\r\nthis region and, as such, many people can send such\r\n\r\nbooks  into or through Singapore by various  means.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there are loopholes which we cannot plug\r\n\r\nfor   the  time  being.  So  far,  these  are   the\r\n\r\nprinciples I have enumerated, but I should say that\r\n\r\nin   general  we  should  hold  liberal  views   on\r\n\r\ncensorship so as to enable an exchange of minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  believe the Minister is quite  sincere  in\r\n\r\ndealing   with  this  matter.

The   general\r\n\r\nstandard of Tamil programmes has been deteriorating\r\n\r\nfrom  year  to year. We have some Tamil  television\r\n\r\nprogrammes which are not in good taste. It  can  be\r\n\r\nsaid,  of course, that this is a matter of opinion.\r\n\r\nHowever, the general opinion is that the programmes\r\n\r\nare  not in good taste at all. Some announcers  who\r\n\r\nread  the  news  bulletins over the  radio  and  on\r\n\r\ntelevision  pronounce their words wrongly,  thereby\r\n\r\nconveying the wrong meaning. Their pronunciation of\r\n\r\nthe Tamil words is very poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If  you\r\n\r\npronounce  panam  with  the proper  intonation,  it\r\n\r\nmeans money. If you pronounce panam in another way,\r\n\r\nit  means coconut. If you pronounce vanam in  Tamil\r\n\r\nwith  the proper intonation, it means the  sky.  If\r\n\r\nyou  pronounce vanam differently, it means a  fire-cracker.  A  little  bit  of  difference   in   the\r\n\r\npronunciation makes a lot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference  in the meaning. And when you  take  two\r\n\r\nwords  together  and pronounce them together,  they\r\n\r\nconvey   one   meaning.  If  you   pronounce   them\r\n\r\nseparately, they mean a different thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Member mentioned\r\n\r\nair hostesses who announced in Tamil which he could\r\n\r\nnot understand, can he give us some examples?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I did not say that I could not\r\n\r\nunderstand  them.  The sound is defective,  whether\r\n\r\nthe announcements were made in the Tamil or English\r\n\r\nlanguage. Later when I raised this question in  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  was  told that the defect in  the  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  Department's  announcements  lay  in  the\r\n\r\nsound  system.  Moreover, the announcers  read  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  with an English accent.  I  was  told\r\n\r\nthat  this occurred not only in the Tamil  language\r\n\r\nannouncements but also in the Chinese, English  and\r\n\r\nMalay  announcements. There was this defect in  the\r\n\r\nairport  because there was something wrong  in  the\r\n\r\nsound system. I was told about this by some Members\r\n\r\nand also by other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Broadcasting. Some of the\r\n\r\nannouncers may have the necessary qualifications in\r\n\r\nthe English language but their spoken Tamil is very\r\n\r\npoor.  In  view of the examples I have  given  just\r\n\r\nnow,  the  announcers should be  tested  in  spoken\r\n\r\nTamil before they are appointed. I do realise  that\r\n\r\nit  is  very hard to get properly qualified persons\r\n\r\nto fill these posts as those qualified in the Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage  are very few. However, will the  Ministry\r\n\r\ntake  steps  to improve the standard of  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage spoken over Radio and Television Singapore\r\n\r\nby   employing  competent  people  as   announcers?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  the Ministry can  employ  part-time\r\n\r\nannouncers who are capable of doing the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter I wish to raise. There is\r\n\r\nonly   one   Tamil  film  screened  on   Television\r\n\r\nSingapore a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek.  It is shown very late in the evening and  it\r\n\r\nfinishes almost towards midnight. The children  who\r\n\r\nwatch this programme have to go to school the  next\r\n\r\nmorning.  So  they either see this  film  and  miss\r\n\r\nschool  the next morning, or deprive themselves  of\r\n\r\nseeing  this film if they wish to go to school  the\r\n\r\nnext  morning. I wish to point out that at one time\r\n\r\nthese  films  were  screened  quite  early  in  the\r\n\r\nevening.  Can  the  department  screen  this   film\r\n\r\nearlier, as was done before?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nregarding  the announcements in the Tamil language,\r\n\r\nmy  colleague has already explained the  situation.\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Communications is not here now. He\r\n\r\nmust,   however,  understand  the   difficulty   of\r\n\r\npronouncing Tamil words correctly. If he has learnt\r\n\r\nthe   language,   he  will  know  the   difficulty,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  pronunciation.  Even   those   who\r\n\r\nannounce in the English medium swallow their words.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the female announcers also swallow  their\r\n\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has also raised the question of the\r\n\r\nlate  Tamil film show. I think the films are  shown\r\n\r\non  Friday, and, as a result, complaints have  been\r\n\r\nmade  because the Tamil people want to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ntemple  on that day. If the film is shown  earlier,\r\n\r\nthe  people  will not go to the temple. The  temple\r\n\r\npeople  have  therefore complained  that  the  film\r\n\r\nshould be shown later in the evening. That may  be\r\n\r\nthe reason why the Minister has decided to show the\r\n\r\nfilm  later, because the people can then go to  the\r\n\r\ntemple early in the evening and come back later and\r\n\r\nsee  the  film. I think that is the reason why  the\r\n\r\nTamil film is shown late and my colleague here will\r\n\r\nprobably understand that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to another matter. What the Member for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir has said about the Tamil programmes is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  They  are not up to standard.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  local people with talent who are able to give\r\n\r\nartistic  performances to suit the taste  of  every\r\n\r\ncommunity.  If we can give these talented  artistes\r\n\r\nintensive training, the quality of the programmes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover the radio and on television  will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the announcers in the Tamil language are\r\n\r\nnot  fluent because of the poor standard  of  local\r\n\r\nTamil  education.  Therefore, I suggest  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  proper  training  in  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage before they are appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Tamil television programmes,\r\n\r\nwe have seen that the scope is limited. Most of the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are repeated over and over again.  This\r\n\r\napplies   also   to  the  Tamil  films   shown   on\r\n\r\ntelevision.  I  suggest that they can  be  improved\r\n\r\ngreatly  so  that  the Tamil community  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nviewing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the T.V. cameramen are using a\r\n\r\nlot of blank films to shoot scenes in the course of\r\n\r\ntheir work. It does not matter if the films serve a\r\n\r\nuseful  purpose, but it is noticed that  the  films\r\n\r\nare  not fully telecast in the T.V. programmes.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  this, I feel there is a wastage of  films\r\n\r\nwhich    involves    Government   in    unnecessary\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  I  would,  therefore,  suggest   that\r\n\r\nunnecessary  shooting  of  scenes  should  not   be\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I came across an article on the front\r\n\r\npage  of  the  Eastern Sun regarding complaints  by\r\n\r\nT.V. cameramen about their working conditions.  It\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that  the cameramen  were  certainly\r\n\r\ngoing to stage a walk-out. Can the Minister explain\r\n\r\nhow  such a situation has arisen and what steps the\r\n\r\nGovernment is taking on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that, of late there has been a\r\n\r\nlot  of  talk  about  price increases  of  consumer\r\n\r\nproducts made by shopkeepers, hawkers, fishmongers,\r\n\r\netc.  I  wonder whether the Minister will  consider\r\n\r\nadvertising   the  official  prices  of   essential\r\n\r\nproducts  daily  in every medium of  communication,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  on  T.V.,  over  the  radio  and  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, etc. For I feel that it would  be  more\r\n\r\nconvenient  for  the  general public  to  know  the\r\n\r\nofficial prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards\r\n\r\nthe  problem of Tamil pronunciation, I am afraid  I\r\n\r\ncannot participate in that kind of debate because I\r\n\r\nam no authority on the matter. But the complaint is\r\n\r\ntaken  note of and we will get our Tamil announcers\r\n\r\nto  improve  in  their  pronunciation.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  not  only  with Tamil but  also  with  the\r\n\r\nChinese   language  and  other  dialects  such   as\r\n\r\nMandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and so on, because  we\r\n\r\nare so far away from the original country where our\r\n\r\nancestors  came from. They brought with them  their\r\n\r\nlanguages.  But  after so many  years  of  use  and\r\n\r\nmisuse,  I  am afraid there must be some distortion\r\n\r\nin  the languages. This is unavoidable. But we will\r\n\r\nlook into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Tamil films in T.V. programmes which\r\n\r\nwe  telecast every Thursday and Friday at about  10\r\n\r\no'clock at night, they are mainly meant for  adults\r\n\r\nand  not for tiny tots. If they are telecast  at  a\r\n\r\nlate  hour,  I presume they are feature  films  for\r\n\r\nadults.  It should not affect the children  because\r\n\r\nthere are other more suitable programmes which they\r\n\r\ncan watch in the earlier part of the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked for clarification\r\n\r\non  why there was a report in the newspapers  about\r\n\r\nT.V. cameramen  who  had  complained  about  their\r\n\r\nconditions of employment. The main reason  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are made to work harder. Recently very strict\r\n\r\nrulings  were  applied  to  the  use  of  freelance\r\n\r\ncameramen.  As  a result, the pressure  is  on  the\r\n\r\ncameramen  who  are  permanently  engaged  by   the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting  Department. Furthermore,  there  were\r\n\r\ntwo or three cameramen whose contracts had not been\r\n\r\nrenewed  due to certain reasons. This made  matters\r\n\r\nworse.  And  so  there was this  complaint  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  I  would say that it is  human  nature\r\n\r\nthat if you make them work too hard, they complain.\r\n\r\nThat is quite true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of blank films, I do not understand\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Anson meant. I  presume  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  cameramen are sent out to shoot  scenes,\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to take a lot of them. But then it is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe editors to select the most appropriate films to\r\n\r\nbe  used on T.V. Most probably they may select only\r\n\r\n40 per cent or even less of the total film shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, it is not true that there are\r\n\r\nother  feature films shown on T.V. for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  Tamil children. Only one film is  shown  a\r\n\r\nweek  for  all  the Tamil-speaking people,  whether\r\n\r\nthey are adults or children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about pronunciation of Tamil\r\n\r\nwords which could convey the wrong meaning. I  have\r\n\r\njust  given  examples  of this,  and  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould take steps to remedy this.

One  relates  to  the\r\n\r\nprogramme \"What Others Say\". Basically, I think the\r\n\r\nconcept behind \"What Others Say\" is sound.  What  I\r\n\r\nam  complaining about is that we have to listen  to\r\n\r\nnews  that has already appeared in the English  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese press a few days after they have  been\r\n\r\ncurrent,  with  the result that this  news  becomes\r\n\r\nstale.   Perhaps  some  added  interest  could   be\r\n\r\ninjected   into  the  programme.  The  views   from\r\n\r\nnewspapers in Manila, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Indonesia\r\n\r\nand maybe even further afield could be reflected in\r\n\r\nthe programme. In this way, we could have a broader\r\n\r\nperspective really of what others say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to talk about is what\r\n\r\nsort of training might be given to our producers in\r\n\r\norder  to improve the quality of local productions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  there  could be some schemes  whereby  our\r\n\r\npeople could be sent abroad. Or we could even bring\r\n\r\nin experts in order to devise and implement schemes\r\n\r\nof training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards\r\n\r\n\"What Others Say\", I understand that there has been\r\n\r\nan  improvement in the programme. If you watch this\r\n\r\nprogramme,  you  will see that it has  been  vastly\r\n\r\nchanged; one of the changes is the presentation  of\r\n\r\nthis  programme. There are now two readers  instead\r\n\r\nof  one - a male and a female -in order to make  it\r\n\r\nmore  interesting.  The graphics  are  also  better\r\n\r\npresented.  It  is  not correct  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  is confined to quoting local newspapers.\r\n\r\nFrequently,  quotations are included  from  English\r\n\r\npublications  like  The Times,  the  Guardian,  the\r\n\r\nEconomist; American publications like the U.S. News\r\n\r\nand  World  Report  and  The  Times  of  New  York;\r\n\r\nAustralian  publications such as the Bulletin;  the\r\n\r\nHong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review and the\r\n\r\nEnglish translation of the French paper, Le  Monde.\r\n\r\nWe  have also quoted from the Bangkok Post and  the\r\n\r\nManila Times on matters of interest for our viewers\r\n\r\nor   listeners.  But  the  problem  is  that  these\r\n\r\nnewspapers do not always carry articles  which  are\r\n\r\nof  relevance  to us. If there is anything  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  which is of interest  to  us,  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the technique of the producers and the\r\n\r\nannouncers, I agree with the Member for Katong that\r\n\r\nthere is room for improvement. This matter will  be\r\n\r\nlooked  into.  We  also have  regular  courses  for\r\n\r\nproducers  and  announcers to attend,  and  regular\r\n\r\ntraining  sessions  in  all  aspects  of  programme\r\n\r\nproduction in radio and T.V, with the assistance of\r\n\r\nforeign experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the\r\n\r\nMinister  and I just differ on what should  be  the\r\n\r\nfrequency with which we should resort to quotations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom newspapers further afield.

The first\r\n\r\nfour  are  Division I posts and the  last  two  are\r\n\r\nDivision II posts. However, the Production Planning\r\n\r\nManager  and the Works Manager are posts which  are\r\n\r\nregraded from the Deputy Government Printer and the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent posts respectively. In terms of  net\r\n\r\nincrease,  there  are only four  new  appointments.\r\n\r\nThese,  together with the regraded posts  mentioned\r\n\r\nabove, are meant to serve as a nucleus of executive\r\n\r\nstaff  to  undertake  new functions  in  the  cost-conscious  set-up. It will be noted  that  the  new\r\n\r\nsenior  appointments  are not  the  result  of  any\r\n\r\nincrease  in the work-load but a need to  undertake\r\n\r\njobs competitively and economically viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why there is no increase in the junior\r\n\r\nappointments,  the  reason is  that  there  are  at\r\n\r\npresent insufficient job commitments to warrant  an\r\n\r\nincrease in their number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It is important\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  know more about  our  neighbours,\r\n\r\nlearn  more  about  their ways of life,  understand\r\n\r\ntheir customs and even their love stories. However,\r\n\r\nmost countries in this region, for that matter  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Asia, do not have an economy  which  can\r\n\r\nsupport a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsophisticated film industry. We need a lot of films\r\n\r\nto  fill the long telecasting hours we have on T.V.\r\n\r\nWe   have   altogether  106\ufffd  hours  per  week   of\r\n\r\ntelecasting time to fill. When we look at  the  map\r\n\r\nof  this  region or the whole of Asia, and ask  the\r\n\r\nquestion, which are the countries which can provide\r\n\r\nus  with  a regular supply of films in the language\r\n\r\nunderstood by the majority of the people  here,  we\r\n\r\nfind  that the answer is in the negative. Japan  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  has a film industry but we cannot use  films\r\n\r\nwhich  are in Japanese dialogue. Dubbing them  into\r\n\r\none  of  our languages is out of the question.  The\r\n\r\nequipment, the time and the technicians required to\r\n\r\ndo the work would make the cost too prohibitive for\r\n\r\nus.  Besides,  there are political implications  to\r\n\r\nconsider. Hong Kong produces a lot of Cantonese and\r\n\r\nMandarin films, but they are mainly feature  films,\r\n\r\nlove  stories, sword fighting and so on.  They  are\r\n\r\nproduced by a few big film companies which are very\r\n\r\nmuch  profit-minded  and they  would  not  normally\r\n\r\nallow  their films to be used by the T.V. stations\r\n\r\nunless the earning power of the films is exhausted.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, there is an understanding among them that\r\n\r\nonly  films  of more than ten years  old  would  be\r\n\r\nreleased  to  T.V. stations. So this  is  far  from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. Besides, we cannot get films of other\r\n\r\ntypes   from  Hong  Kong,  such  as  documentaries,\r\n\r\nvariety  shows  and  so on.  The  same  applies  to\r\n\r\ncountries like Thailand, the Philippines,  Vietnam,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and others, because these  countries  do\r\n\r\nnot have a film industry. So whether we like it  or\r\n\r\nnot, we have to depend on western countries such as\r\n\r\nthe  United States, Britain, Germany and  Australia\r\n\r\nwhich have better developed resources to supply the\r\n\r\nwhole   range  of  T.V. programming  on  a   world\r\n\r\nsyndicated  basis. Films from these  countries  are\r\n\r\nnormally   in  English.  Therefore,  the   language\r\n\r\nproblem  is  not so great when we use these  films.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  reason  why a  great  percentage  of\r\n\r\ntelecasting  time is devoted to western  films.  In\r\n\r\nfact, about 52 per cent of the telecasting time is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven to English films and programmes like that. It\r\n\r\nis  not that we want to, but because we just cannot\r\n\r\nget  enough  films in the other languages.  But  to\r\n\r\nhelp our audience understand some of the films, sub-titles  are used. Even with the English films  that\r\n\r\nwe  are getting, our choice is very narrow. We  can\r\n\r\nonly pick and choose from a list of films which the\r\n\r\nfilm  distributors  have  decided  to  release  for\r\n\r\ncirculation  in this region. In normal practice,  a\r\n\r\ndistributor  only brings in a film for  circulation\r\n\r\nin  this  region  when  he  is  sure  that  several\r\n\r\nstations in this region want to rent that film.  In\r\n\r\nother words, we have to follow the crowd, and it is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to impose our independent taste  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter of film selection. For example, recently  we\r\n\r\nwanted to acquire some films from Britain on opera,\r\n\r\nballet dancing, choir singing, music and so on.  We\r\n\r\nthought  this  would help our people to  appreciate\r\n\r\nsome  good aspects of western culture, but we  were\r\n\r\nforewarned  that if the Singapore  station  is  the\r\n\r\nonly station in this region that wants this kind of\r\n\r\nfilm,  it  would have to bear the cost of the  film\r\n\r\nprint  and  the  cost  of  freight,  including  the\r\n\r\ninsurance  charges, to bring the film all  the  way\r\n\r\nhere  from Britain and to send it back also.  This,\r\n\r\nplus  the  rental of the films, makes the  cost  of\r\n\r\nacquiring such films prohibitively high. If we have\r\n\r\nto  do the same to every film that we show and  pay\r\n\r\nthe  high cost, I think the money provided  for  in\r\n\r\nthis  subhead  would not last  for  more  than  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  let  alone for the whole of the  financial\r\n\r\nyear. So that is the position we are faced with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nquite  agree  with the Minister when he  says  that\r\n\r\ndubbing  the  Japanese film in one of our  official\r\n\r\nlanguages  is impossible.

The main responsibility of this\r\n\r\nDivision is to promote and develop sports. Recently\r\n\r\nthis  Division  has  done  a  great  deal  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection. We can see that sports activities in the\r\n\r\nrepublic  have been very active and are  developing\r\n\r\nat  a  fast pace. The Sports Division has also done\r\n\r\nits  share in the promotion of regional sports  and\r\n\r\nathletics. For instance, we have already sent quite\r\n\r\na  number  of  sports delegations to take  part  in\r\n\r\nvarious  regional sports meets, such  as  the  SEAP\r\n\r\nGames  and the Asian Games. At this moment  another\r\n\r\nregional  sports  meet  is  taking  place  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  namely,  the First  Commonwealth  Table\r\n\r\nTennis  Tournament. All these can help  to  promote\r\n\r\nthe  development of sports in our country, and will\r\n\r\nmake  our  people  healthier and more  rugged  than\r\n\r\nbefore. Besides making our people more healthy  and\r\n\r\nrugged,  these  sports and athletic activities  can\r\n\r\nalso   play  a  role  in  raising  our   level   of\r\n\r\nsportsmanship. We should develop the skills of  our\r\n\r\nsportsmen  in  the various fields of  athletics  in\r\n\r\norder to raise our standards so as to enable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  to  win honour for our country in international\r\n\r\ncompetitions. In this respect, I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister some questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Sports Division any plans to train\r\n\r\nour  national sports representatives?  I  ask  this\r\n\r\nbecause  our  standards  in  basketball,  football,\r\n\r\nsoccer,  and badminton have gone down.  Very  often\r\n\r\nour  teams have brought back a big duck's egg  from\r\n\r\ninternational  competitions. So we  should  do  our\r\n\r\nbest  to  remedy  this situation, so  that  in  the\r\n\r\nshortest  possible time we may bring our  standards\r\n\r\nup   to   the   level  required  for  international\r\n\r\ncompetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are now building the National Sports\r\n\r\nStadium,  better  known  as  the  National   Sports\r\n\r\nComplex.  I would like to know what is the progress\r\n\r\nup  to  date,  and when will construction  work  be\r\n\r\ncompleted. And when completed, what kind of  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  will be provided by this complex.  Will\r\n\r\nwe  have  the honour of hosting any regional  competitions or international tournaments in sports or\r\n\r\nathletics?  Moreover, are there any  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor sports bodies to make a comparative study so as\r\n\r\nto improve our own standards and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nbring  about  a richer recreational  life  for  our\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must  thank  the\r\n\r\nMember for Sembawang for raising his questions  and\r\n\r\nfor  saying  so  many  words of  encouragement.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years our Ministry, particularly the Sports\r\n\r\nDivision,  has actually done a great deal  for  our\r\n\r\nsports and athletic activities. The Member wants to\r\n\r\nknow  what plans the Sports Division has  to  train\r\n\r\nour  sports  representatives. I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthat   we   all  know  that  sports  and   athletic\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore are mainly carried  out  by\r\n\r\nthe  individual  amateur sports  bodies,  and  they\r\n\r\nselect   their  own  representatives.  We,   as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment  department, are  only  responsible  for\r\n\r\nadministrative matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards training, it is undertaken by the\r\n\r\nvarious  amateur  sports  bodies.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang   may   recall  that  we  have   recently\r\n\r\nestablished  the  National Sports Promotion  Board,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a statutory body. It is charged with  the\r\n\r\npromotion  and development of sports  and  athletic\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  at  the  same  time  to   provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for the various amateur sports  bodies.\r\n\r\nNow that the Board is functioning, I am sure it has\r\n\r\na lot of plans to promote and to develop sports and\r\n\r\nathletic  activities  in  Singapore.  The  National\r\n\r\nSports Promotion Board has, among its members,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Social Affairs as Chairman. Since  he\r\n\r\nis  in  the  chair, I am sure the Board  will  have\r\n\r\nenough  plans and facilities to promote sports  and\r\n\r\nathletic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the National Sports Complex will be\r\n\r\nready, I can say that the building progress is  now\r\n\r\nhalf-way  through. It is expected to  complete  the\r\n\r\nSports Stadium by the middle of 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether regional or\r\n\r\ninternational tournaments or competitions  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  in our Sports Stadium, I think this can  best\r\n\r\nbe answered by the National Sports Promotion Board,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is up to the Board to decide what  kind\r\n\r\nof  regional  or international sports  or  athletic\r\n\r\ntournaments  or competitions will  be  held.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  question will have to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the Board before any  answer  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view\r\n\r\nof  the  detailed answer given by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears to me that the Central Complaints\r\n\r\nBureau  has  outlived its usefulness.  I  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause there seems to be an obvious preference  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the general public  to  bring  their\r\n\r\ncomplaints to Members of Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  air them through the press. Many people seem to\r\n\r\nbe   running   their  own  independent   complaints\r\n\r\nbureaux.  Even  Radio  and  T.V.  Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nChinese programme called Tah Chung Ter Hua. So with\r\n\r\nall this competing demand for attention, I think it\r\n\r\nis  a  waste  of money to continue to maintain  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Complaints Bureau. We might as well  close\r\n\r\nit  down  and divert the staff to, say, the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate, a move which I am sure will please my\r\n\r\nunion colleagues here very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, I think it is still necessary to have\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Complaints Bureau. It operates  as  a\r\n\r\ncentral  agency for members of the public  to  make\r\n\r\ncomplaints  so  that  any  discourtesy,  delay   of\r\n\r\nservice,  or  petty bureaucracy in  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice  can  be eradicated or kept under  control.\r\n\r\nThese  facilities should be made accessible to  any\r\n\r\nmember  of the public, in addition to any  protests\r\n\r\nor  complaints  made to Members of Parliament.  The\r\n\r\nCentral  Complaints  Bureau is not  competing  with\r\n\r\nMembers, but is just an additional means of helping\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1970 alone the Bureau attended to 794\r\n\r\ncases  as  compared with 654 in 1969. The staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bureau rendered services to 28,103 members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public in 1970, when they wanted to know about\r\n\r\nthe   locations  and  functions  of   the   various\r\n\r\ndepartments  in the vicinity of Empress  Place  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of the investigations and action\r\n\r\ntaken by the Central Complaints Bureau, out of  794\r\n\r\ncomplaints received in 1970, only 19 cases could be\r\n\r\nattributed to rudeness or discourtesy. As a  result\r\n\r\nof  this, the following action was taken: dismissal\r\n\r\nof  officers, one case; disciplinary action  taken,\r\n\r\nfive  cases; retirement due to disciplinary action,\r\n\r\ntwo  cases; resignation before investigation -  the\r\n\r\nofficers were a bit afraid - two cases; warning  by\r\n\r\nthe department, eight cases; insufficient evidence,\r\n\r\n27  cases. There were 65 cases of complaints  which\r\n\r\nwere not substantiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith  due respect to Members, this Bureau is  still\r\n\r\nnecessary and it has not outlived its usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his explanation but, at the same time,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to suggest that perhaps a little time  and\r\n\r\neffort  should  be spent on public relations.

The Bureau looks after\r\n\r\npoor  people who need legal aid. It tries to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir  difficulties so that law and justice can  be\r\n\r\nput at their service. It seeks to provide effective\r\n\r\nservice to the masses and in a way it is a kind  of\r\n\r\nwelfare   institution.  However,  I  have  received\r\n\r\nseveral complaints recently that when people go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Legal  Aid Bureau for assistance, their  cases\r\n\r\nare  usually delayed for three or four  months  and\r\n\r\nsometimes even up to six months. If that  is  true,\r\n\r\nthen  I  feel  that it is very unreasonable.  There\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  any  delay  because  this   would\r\n\r\ninconvenience the people seeking its services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is about the staff in the\r\n\r\nBureau.  Their attitude, when dealing with  members\r\n\r\nof   the   public,   seems  to  be   arrogant   and\r\n\r\nindifferent.  They  seem to  be  half-hearted  when\r\n\r\npeople go to them to seek legal assistance.  It  is\r\n\r\nnatural  that  people only turn up  at  the  Bureau\r\n\r\nbecause they wish to seek legal assistance in order\r\n\r\nto get justice done to them or to get help to solve\r\n\r\ntheir  problems.  If the staff in  the  Bureau  are\r\n\r\narrogant, the members of the public will be  afraid\r\n\r\nof  them,  and they will not dare to turn up  again\r\n\r\nfor assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter about which I have\r\n\r\nreceived complaints from members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the public. The Bureau is rather slow  in\r\n\r\ndealing with the cases. Very often the public  have\r\n\r\nto  wait in the Bureau for two or three hours at  a\r\n\r\nstretch.  The efficiency of the Bureau is  actually\r\n\r\nin question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity to request the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  look into these three complaints  and\r\n\r\nsee whether they are true. If they are true, I hope\r\n\r\nhe  will  take  immediate measures  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  in the Legal Aid Bureau  so  that  it\r\n\r\nwill be able to serve the poor people better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nhas raised three points. First, on the question  of\r\n\r\ndelay,  let  me  inform the House  that  since  its\r\n\r\ninception  in 1955, the Legal Aid Bureau has  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  about  31,000 cases. There  are  about  3,000\r\n\r\nfiles  in circulation at the moment which are being\r\n\r\nattended  to  by five legal officers. Thousands  of\r\n\r\nfiles  which have since been classified  as  closed\r\n\r\nwere  settled  within six months and some  of  them\r\n\r\nbetween  six  months and two years. The  period  of\r\n\r\nsettlement in each case depends on the type of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  and  its  complexity. If  proceedings  are\r\n\r\ninstituted,  it is out of the hands of  the  Bureau\r\n\r\nand there may be delay in the fixing of the date of\r\n\r\nhearing  by the courts. This is one of the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the  delay. So far we have not  received  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about this. There may have been  a  few\r\n\r\ncomplaints  in  delay but this is easily  explained\r\n\r\nand  they  are due to a variety of reasons.  First,\r\n\r\nthe applicant's inability to supply the Bureau with\r\n\r\nthe  necessary information. Second,  delay  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  opposing party in  replying  to  our\r\n\r\nletters in spite of reminders. In cases of accident\r\n\r\nclaims,  we  have  to wait for police  and  medical\r\n\r\nreports.  Lastly, all matters which are contentious\r\n\r\nmust  be brought before the Legal Aid Board  either\r\n\r\nfor  approval or refusal, depending on whether  the\r\n\r\napplicant has reasonable grounds for being a  party\r\n\r\nto  a  civil  proceeding. In  all  such  cases,  an\r\n\r\nopinion  must be returned by the legal  officer  in\r\n\r\ncharge  for  the consideration of the  Board  which\r\n\r\nconvenes once in six weeks or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to please everyone, Sir, but it\r\n\r\ncan  be simply said that the officers of the Bureau\r\n\r\nhave  always  endeavoured  and  will  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nassist applicants as best they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the arrogance of the staff,\r\n\r\nthis  is  another reason why as I  have  said,  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Complaints Bureau is still  essential.  In\r\n\r\ngeneral,    very   few   people   appreciate    the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and handicaps which the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Aid  Bureau have to face. This can  only  be\r\n\r\nappreciated by spending some time in the Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau.  I  hope that one of these days the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang will visit the Bureau  and  see  for\r\n\r\nhimself  the difficulties that are being  faced  by\r\n\r\nthe  officials. I have not received any  complaints\r\n\r\nof my staff being arrogant. On the contrary, I have\r\n\r\nhad  praise  for  their work in the Bureau.  Should\r\n\r\nthere  be  any  such cases, I hope the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang will bring them to my notice and  I  will\r\n\r\nsurely get an investigation instituted and take the\r\n\r\nnecessary  action if it is proved that the  officer\r\n\r\nis arrogant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already explained the procedure in the\r\n\r\nLegal  Aid Bureau.

H. Tan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Social Welfare Department is a welfare\r\n\r\ninstitution which looks after the needs of the poor\r\n\r\nand  unemployed  people. Every year the  Government\r\n\r\nsets aside a few million dollars for the welfare of\r\n\r\npeople  who require and deserve assistance.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,    this   measure   is   noteworthy    and\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are certain matters about the\r\n\r\ndepartment which are not satisfactory. In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nhave received several genuine complaints about  the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  For  example,  the  rates  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance  have  been reduced. In  the  past,  the\r\n\r\namount of public assistance given to the head of  a\r\n\r\nfamily  was  $21  per month. The complaint  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived is that this sum has been reduced  to  $16\r\n\r\nper month. I wonder whether this is true. If it  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  has  the  reduction  been  made  with   good\r\n\r\nreasons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $21 per month is already a meagre sum. It is\r\n\r\nnot  adequate  to  maintain  the  existence  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual particularly at a time when the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving is rising. So a reduction of this sum to $16\r\n\r\nwill  make life even more difficult. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not only refrain from reducing the rate  of\r\n\r\npublic assistance but instead give consideration to\r\n\r\nincreasing    it,   in   view   of   the    present\r\n\r\ncircumstances, in order to enable the recipients of\r\n\r\npublic assistance to pull along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to explain and also to\r\n\r\nlook into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  note  with  great concern  the  almost  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  cut in expenditure on social welfare.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Social Affairs has in recent  months\r\n\r\npointed  proudly at the decline in  the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons on social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare as an indicator of economic development and\r\n\r\nincreasing  employment. As  an  economist,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nnaturally  endorse such a reaction. As a socialist,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I  would want to say that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  give  more  in welfare  aid  per  remaining\r\n\r\nperson   and   perhaps  lay  down  less   stringent\r\n\r\nrequirement for such aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, you will note that\r\n\r\ndisbursements  of  only  $4.9  million  under   the\r\n\r\nheading \"Other charges, annually recurrent\" require\r\n\r\npersonal emoluments of $2.2 million. Sir, the rates\r\n\r\nof  welfare assistance are paltry by any  standard.\r\n\r\nThe  maximum receivable per family is  on  $60  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  a  rate which has remained unchanged  since\r\n\r\n1962,  so  I am informed by the Director of  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare. As an economist, I am aware that too  much\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  can be a serious  deterrent  to\r\n\r\nindividual  motivations to work.  However,  in  our\r\n\r\nsituation, we are far below the disincentive point.\r\n\r\nConsider, Sir, the rent for Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats is at least $20 per month for  a  one-room flat and public utilities probably cost $10 to\r\n\r\n$15 per month. Even if a distressed family receives\r\n\r\nthe  maximum amount of $60, there is not very  much\r\n\r\nleft to keep body and soul together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest cut under the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment's   Head   is  in  respect   of   public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance  from $5.2  million  to  $3.4\r\n\r\nmillion. Next is the T.B, treatment allowances from\r\n\r\n$450,000  to  $250,000.  The  item  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nassistance  to displaced and distressed persons  is\r\n\r\ngiven  only a token vote. I cannot believe that  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  more displaced and distressed persons.  I\r\n\r\nmay  be  able to understand and perhaps support  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure cut on social welfare if our economy is\r\n\r\ndoing  badly.  But with the present boom,  this  is\r\n\r\nunwarranted   and  goes  very  much   against   our\r\n\r\nsocialist principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike other classes, the poor and the\r\n\r\nilliterate  are  not  just inarticulate,  they  are\r\n\r\nvoiceless. The employers have their representatives\r\n\r\nand the middle-class has the Member for Katong. But\r\n\r\nhow many will speak up for the poor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen some beautiful penthouses recently,\r\n\r\nnot  private  ones too. Our statutory boards  spend\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars on such things  as\r\n\r\nholiday bungalows and recreational clubs for senior\r\n\r\nofficers.  I have nothing against luxury,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe poorest classes are well taken care of. If this\r\n\r\nHouse  will vote an increase for social welfare  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  at  least  two-thirds  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease  in  national income, I  promise  to  stop\r\n\r\ntalking about penthouses here or elsewhere. I might\r\n\r\neven consent to open one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a great deal that needs to be done\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  social  welfare.  There  could  be\r\n\r\nimprovements in the homes for orphans, for example.\r\n\r\nLet them have some pieces of chicken along with the\r\n\r\ncurry  instead of the curry alone. Our old people's\r\n\r\nhomes  could  do with more attention  too.  In  our\r\n\r\nsociety  which  is fast modernising,  the  extended\r\n\r\nfamily system is breaking down rapidly. Fewer older\r\n\r\npeople  are living with their children. The mother-in-law  no  longer commands the household  in  many\r\n\r\nhomes.  Probably our flats are too small  to  house\r\n\r\nmore  than two generations under one roof.  Let  us\r\n\r\ntherefore have more and better homes for the  aged.\r\n\r\nSir, I hold no brief for the idle and the lazy. But\r\n\r\npeople cannot compete if they are handicapped,  and\r\n\r\nwhen such is the case, our society should have  the\r\n\r\ncompassion  to  care and to provide  adequately  if\r\n\r\nonly because of our common humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first\r\n\r\nanswer the query of the Member for Sembawang on the\r\n\r\ndecrease in the rate of public assistance from  $21\r\n\r\nto  $16  per  month? The present  rates  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  are: $21 for the head of a family;  $10\r\n\r\nfor  the wife; $8 for dependants above 16 years  of\r\n\r\nage, and $5 for dependants below 16 years of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage. The usual payment for the head of a family  is\r\n\r\n$21  if  the  person receives no other  sources  of\r\n\r\nincome.  However,  if  he has partial  income  from\r\n\r\nother sources, the allowance may be reduced. It  is\r\n\r\nnot possible to comment on individual cases without\r\n\r\nknowing  the  full circumstances  of  the  case.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat, we have not reduced any welfare rate at all\r\n\r\nand, in fact, the policy has not changed so far. In\r\n\r\ncase   the  Member  for  Sembawang  has   got   any\r\n\r\nindividual case, he can take it up with my Ministry\r\n\r\nand we will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Whampoa, he is correct in\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  cut  in  expenditure  on  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  will amount to almost $2 million  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  financial  year.  To  be  more  exact,  the\r\n\r\ncurrent provision of $9,080,200 will be reduced  to\r\n\r\n$7,178,250,    representing    a    decrease     of\r\n\r\napproximately $1.8 million or 21 per cent. I should\r\n\r\npoint  out, however, that this substantial drop  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for the Social Welfare  Department  is\r\n\r\ndue  mainly  to  more efficient management  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  welfare services aided by  the  improving\r\n\r\nsocial  situation,  and not due to  any  deliberate\r\n\r\npolicy  to cut down expenditure on social  welfare,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  it  is the policy of the  department  to\r\n\r\nassist  all  families who are  in  need  of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare assistance in one form or another. I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to  assure the Member for Whampoa  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no  curtailment  in  the  existing\r\n\r\nservices  provided by the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nduring  the  next financial year. On the  contrary,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  an  expansion  of  some  of  these\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that the bulk of the reduction\r\n\r\nin  the expenditure estimates of the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment fall under the following items:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Public Assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision reduced from $5.2 million to $3.4\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  improving\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation and fewer applications  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance, and not to any change in policy\r\n\r\nor in the rates of payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) T.B. Treatment Allowance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision reduced from $450,000 to $250,000. This\r\n\r\nis  mainly due to improving standards of living and\r\n\r\nbetter medical control and treatment of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Teachers in voluntary institutions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $252,910 for the salaries of 32\r\n\r\nteachers in voluntary institutions has been entered\r\n\r\nunder the expenditure estimates of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and therefore there will be no reduction\r\n\r\nin expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three items alone account for a reduction\r\n\r\nof  $2.3  million in expenditure estimates for  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department. Members will  therefore\r\n\r\nagree  that, although there is an overall reduction\r\n\r\nof  $1.8  million in the provision for  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department, the department  will  in  fact\r\n\r\nhave  approximately half a million dollars more  to\r\n\r\nspend  on  its  other services, apart  from  public\r\n\r\nassistance and T.B., treatment allowances.  We  agree\r\n\r\nthat  the disbursements of only $4.9 million  under\r\n\r\n\"Other   charges,   annually   recurrent\"   require\r\n\r\npersonal  emoluments  of  $2.2  million.  I   would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  it  is  not  a  good  criterion  for\r\n\r\nassessing  existing  social  welfare  services   by\r\n\r\nrelating  personal  emoluments to  \"Other  charges,\r\n\r\nannually recurrent\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the provision of the social welfare services,\r\n\r\nassistance given to needy families in the  form  of\r\n\r\npersonal services is as important as the giving  of\r\n\r\ncash allowances. There are many types of supporting\r\n\r\nservices  which  the Social Welfare Department  can\r\n\r\ngive to enable individuals and families to function\r\n\r\nmore  effectively,  and unless adequate  funds  are\r\n\r\nprovided   to  enable  the  department  to   employ\r\n\r\nprofessional personnel, the work of the  department\r\n\r\nmay tend to become merely palliative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa is correct in saying that\r\n\r\nthe   existing  rates  of  public  assistance  have\r\n\r\nremained unchanged since 1962. But he will no doubt\r\n\r\nagree  with  me that the years subsequent  to  1962\r\n\r\nhave been rather difficult years for the Government\r\n\r\nand that it is only now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  our  economy  has entered  a  more  promising\r\n\r\nphase,  although we are by no means totally out  of\r\n\r\nthe wood yet. It is true that the existing rates of\r\n\r\npublic assistance are on the low side, but I should\r\n\r\nmention  that, in addition to the public assistance\r\n\r\nallowance, a disability allowance of $10 per  month\r\n\r\nis  payable  to  the  head of a  household  who  is\r\n\r\ncertified as permanently disabled and incapable  of\r\n\r\nengaging in gainful employment. Bus fares are  also\r\n\r\ngiven to recipients who have to attend hospital for\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment. Supplementary payments  in  the\r\n\r\nform of educational grants, meal subsidies, old-age\r\n\r\nallowances,   funeral  grants  and  other   special\r\n\r\nallowances  may also be made from other  charitable\r\n\r\nfunds  to needy families, e.g., the Silver  Jubilee\r\n\r\nFund,  the Lee Foundation, etc. The sum of $250,000\r\n\r\nprovided  for the T.B., treatment allowances  under\r\n\r\nsubhead   2064  will  be  adequate  to   meet   all\r\n\r\napplications  for  assistance under  the  Treatment\r\n\r\nAllowances  Scheme. There is no point in  providing\r\n\r\nfunds  that will not be required during the  coming\r\n\r\nyear, and it is anticipated that the number of T.B.\r\n\r\ncases will continue to decline in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the subhead on assistance to displaced\r\n\r\nand  distressed persons, I should explain that this\r\n\r\nvote  is utilised to provide emergency cash  relief\r\n\r\nto victims of civil calamities and other categories\r\n\r\nof  persons  who  may  be placed  in  an  emergency\r\n\r\nsituation.  It  is  not possible  to  estimate  the\r\n\r\namount  of funds required for such purposes.  Hence\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of  a token vote of  $10.  Whenever\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is incurred under this  item,  payment\r\n\r\nwill,  in  the first instance, be made out  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  vote, and should  it  be  found\r\n\r\ninsufficient, an application will be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance for supplementary provision.  I\r\n\r\ntend to agree with the view expressed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Whampoa  that the poor and the illiterate  are\r\n\r\ninarticulate,  and  I  am  glad  to  know  that  he\r\n\r\nchampions  their cause. My Ministry is not  unaware\r\n\r\nof this fact. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing  everything possible to help this segment  of\r\n\r\nour  population. There is no doubt as to what needs\r\n\r\nto  be  done in respect of social welfare. In fact,\r\n\r\nduring  the last few years the department has  been\r\n\r\nactively engaged not only in consolidating some  of\r\n\r\nits  services  but also in expanding  some  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting services, as well as introducing new ones.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be tedious for me to enumerate the  whole\r\n\r\nlist of improvements that have been made during the\r\n\r\npast  few  years. Suffice it for me to give  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples  of improvements that will take  place  in\r\n\r\nthe coming financial year to illustrate my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Woodlands Home for the Aged is currently\r\n\r\nbeing extended with the construction of a  few\r\n\r\ndormitories  and  dining  halls.   This   will\r\n\r\nincrease  the bed capacity in this  home  from 500 to 704.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Junior Approved School and Remand Home,\r\n\r\nwhen   completed  in  mid-1971,  will  provide\r\n\r\naccommodation and training facilities for  112\r\n\r\nyoung offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Jurong Town Creche, when completed in mid-1971, will cater for 120 children of working\r\n\r\nparents. The Fostering Scheme for Infants  and\r\n\r\nChildren  will  be expanded to  take  in  more\r\n\r\nbabies  and children who are in need of foster\r\n\r\ncare.   The  provision  for  this   has   been\r\n\r\nincreased from $107,000 to $114,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Rent subsidy for Malay families affected by\r\n\r\nurban   redevelopment  will  be  paid  to   an\r\n\r\nincreased  number of families.  The  provision\r\n\r\nfor  this  has been increased from $35,000  to $80,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We are not only two years late but more  than\r\n\r\ntwo   years  behind  time!

Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  only department where  the  personal\r\n\r\nemoluments have been decreased by $7,090,  although\r\n\r\nfour new posts have been created. The Memorandum on\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1971-72 states that this is  because\r\n\r\nvariable  and special allowances have decreased  by\r\n\r\n$147,290.  What  are  these  variable  and  special\r\n\r\nallowances and why have they been withdrawn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of many resignations from the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade.  Does  the  Minister not  think  that  the\r\n\r\nremoval of existing allowances enjoyed by the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  personnel could lead to more resignations,\r\n\r\nand  does  he  not find it difficult  to  fill  the\r\n\r\nvacancies caused? It is also known that there is  a\r\n\r\nlack  of response to filling them. Can the Minister\r\n\r\nconfirm  or  deny  that  this  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory working conditions and perhaps  also\r\n\r\nbecause of the unrealistic salaries offered?  Since\r\n\r\na  commission  has  been set up to  look  into  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of our Police Force, will the  Government\r\n\r\nnot  set  up  a  commission also to look  into  the\r\n\r\nsalary structure and working conditions of our Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade personnel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nreference to the question put up by the Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu,  I  remember that at the  last  budget\r\n\r\nsession   he  raised  the  question  of  the   late\r\n\r\npublication of the Fire Brigade Annual Reports, and\r\n\r\nI   said  that  I  would  look  into  it.  For  the\r\n\r\ninformation of the House, the 1968 and 1969  Annual\r\n\r\nReports  were  published in January 1970  and  July\r\n\r\n1970  respectively.  I am also  pleased  to  inform\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House that the 1970 Annual  Report\r\n\r\nhas  been  completed  in draft  form  and  will  be\r\n\r\npublished   shortly.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  has  been  some  reorganisation   and\r\n\r\nexpansion and the provision of more senior staff to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs  of industry and fire  prevention.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  have some vacancies  in  the  various\r\n\r\ncategories of officers and firemen, this is not due\r\n\r\nto  the  poor  conditions of work  or  salary,  but\r\n\r\nbecause   the   private   sector   offers    better\r\n\r\nemoluments.  We  find  very  few  people  who   are\r\n\r\ninterested in joining the Singapore Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the variable allowances given to the\r\n\r\nmembers of the Fire Brigade some years ago,  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that the provision for 1971-72 is much less,\r\n\r\nfor  the simple reason that many staff members  opt\r\n\r\nto  accept  the  new  consolidated  salary  scales.\r\n\r\nVariable allowance, of course, is not available  to\r\n\r\npersonnel  who  accept the new consolidated  salary\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the special allowance, this is in lieu of\r\n\r\nthe  ration  allowance. Those who joined  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade up to the rank of Section Leader before 9th\r\n\r\nMay,  1961, are eligible for the special allowance.\r\n\r\nThe  collective agreement that was effective on 9th\r\n\r\nMay,  1961,  was extended until 1969  when  it  was\r\n\r\nrenegotiated.  In  1969 it became  effective  as  a\r\n\r\nspecial allowance on the 1st January, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that the Member raised concerns\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of reviewing the emoluments of the\r\n\r\nstaff of the Fire Brigade Department. This is being\r\n\r\ndone,  and  it  is hoped that the  review  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment,  I would like to clarify a small  point.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as I am concerned, I cannot recall  having\r\n\r\nreceived  the  Annual Reports of the  Fire  Brigade\r\n\r\nDepartment  for the two years 1968 and 1969.
