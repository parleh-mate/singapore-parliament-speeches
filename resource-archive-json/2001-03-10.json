Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GPC for Home Affairs will focus primarily on\r\n\r\nthe Home Team and its relationship with the community in this\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Supply.  We believe that the Home  Team  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work hard at integrating the community  in  its\r\n\r\nefforts to fight crime in Singapore.  Because of the increase\r\n\r\nof  public  awareness  in  crime  prevention,  we  have  seen\r\n\r\npositive  results in combating crime in Singapore.  We  would\r\n\r\nlike to see more done in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Team released its major crime report\r\n\r\nrecently,  indicating a drop of over 17%  in  major  offences\r\n\r\ncases.   This  is heartening news indeed and  the  Home  Team\r\n\r\ndeserves  recognition  for a job  well  done  in  year  2000.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are  a couple of disturbing  statistics  and\r\n\r\ntrends  and I would like to ask the Minister to clarify  some\r\n\r\nof  these  for  us.   First,  for  sexual  offences,  namely,\r\n\r\noutraging modesty and rape, the decrease has been marginal  - 1.6%  for  rape  and  3.3% for outraging modesty.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, these offences are still committed with regularity.  I\r\n\r\nam particularly concerned that the two rape/murder cases, one\r\n\r\nin  Woodlands and the other in Bukit Gombak, remain  unsolved\r\n\r\nto  this  day.  Even more disturbing perhaps is that  we  now\r\n\r\nhave  sexual  offenders who are using the Internet  and  chat\r\n\r\nlines  to establish contact with their victims.  Even  though\r\n\r\nthe  figures may still be low, eight rapes and two  cases  of\r\n\r\noutraging modesty, they are on the increase, and may increase\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  if  no  action is taken.  How  will  the  Home  Team\r\n\r\nrespond  to  this worrying problem?  May I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team  embark  on  a publicity campaign,  especially  in\r\n\r\nsecondary schools and the like, to warn young people  of  the\r\n\r\npotential  dangers  of  becoming too friendly  with  Internet\r\n\r\ncontacts.  Simple measures such as getting them to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  their chaperone comes along perhaps should be  told  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, while I note that house-breaking has registered\r\n\r\na  30%-plus  drop in the year 2000, the number  of  break-ins\r\n\r\ninto  private properties has actually increased  somewhat   - 134  cases  in  year 2000 as compared with 97  in  1999.   In\r\n\r\npercentage terms, the increase is in the region of about 38%.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister  let  us  know  how  the  Home  Team  is\r\n\r\nresponding  to this worrying trend?  Has the Home  Team,  for\r\n\r\nexample, taken any steps, similar to the ones that have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  in  HDB  estates where police officers  have  actually\r\n\r\nvisited  the  residential  units to  provide  residents  with\r\n\r\ninformation  and  advice  about  crime  prevention?   Perhaps\r\n\r\nsimilar  steps should be taken by the police with respect  to\r\n\r\nprivate homes and estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I note that foreigners account for roughly 10% of\r\n\r\nthose  arrested  for crimes in Singapore.  While  this  might\r\n\r\nseem  as a small percentage, it nonetheless comes to a figure\r\n\r\nof  nearly  1,500 foreigners  -  the majority  of  them  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders or on social visit passes.  I should like  to\r\n\r\nknow  whether  we  have sufficiently tight  controls  at  our\r\n\r\nborder  checkpoints to prevent such criminals  from  entering\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Do we have good relations with the police  forces\r\n\r\nof  other ASEAN countries, South Asian countries and China to\r\n\r\nimprove the screening of foreigners coming to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Home Team has made Singapore a\r\n\r\nmuch  safer home for almost everyone.  I hope that this  year\r\n\r\nit will be an even safer one for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nlast year, the crime rate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  reduced by 14.7% as compared to 1999, and this  is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  Many people are saying that our Home  Team  has\r\n\r\nbeen doing a very good job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining law and order in our society is just as\r\n\r\nimportant  as  our  national defence,  and  we  need  a  very\r\n\r\neffective  force to take care of this matter.  Our  declining\r\n\r\ncrime rate did not come by chance.  It is  the result of  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of our Home Team.  Last Saturday, I attended  the\r\n\r\nannual  meeting  of the review committee on  the  Home  Team,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  the Police, Immigration  and  CNB  officers.\r\n\r\nEvery  unit  presented  its  workplans  and  these  are  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and farsighted plans.   That is why I say  that\r\n\r\nthe decline in our crime rate did not come by chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, generally, the crime rate has reduced,\r\n\r\nrecently we read from the media that there were many cases of\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquencies, especially young girls involving  in\r\n\r\nfighting  and robbery, and there were also a lot of cases  of\r\n\r\noutraging  of  modesty and rape.  This gives the  people  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there seems to be an increase in the  number\r\n\r\nof juvenile delinquency cases.  It is particularly noteworthy\r\n\r\nthat  an army officer and a teacher were involved in a series\r\n\r\nof  outraging of modesty cases.  There was also  one  15-year\r\n\r\nold  girl  who  made friend with someone on the Internet  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  had  sexual  intercourse  with  a   number   of\r\n\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the statistics released by the police\r\n\r\nthat  there were only two outraging of modesty cases  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  Internet acquaintances, there were eight cases of rape.\r\n\r\nThis  was  significantly more than last year's  figure.   But\r\n\r\nthese  were  only reported cases.  We do not  know  how  many\r\n\r\ncases went unnoticed, because no police report was lodged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that our young people and students like to\r\n\r\ngo  on  ICQ  and chat room on the Internet.   And because  of\r\n\r\ntheir curiosity, they become easy prey for the criminals.   I\r\n\r\nthink the parents and the teachers should take special notice\r\n\r\nof this.  Although such cases are not many, it seems to be on\r\n\r\nan upward trend.  I think\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe police should pay more attention to this problem and take\r\n\r\nsome effective measures to counter them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, earlier, I spoke about\r\n\r\nthe  need  for the Home Team to establish a strong bond  with\r\n\r\nthe  community.  There are several innovative  programmes  in\r\n\r\nplace to encourage this sort of bonding.  In particular,  the\r\n\r\ntwo-year  old Community Safety and Security Programme  (CSSP)\r\n\r\nhas taken root in many grassroots organisations.  Even school\r\n\r\nchildren  and  stallholders in markets are  now  involved  in\r\n\r\nCSSP.   At  last count, over 500 RCs are involved in  such  a\r\n\r\nprogramme.  This, again, is a major achievement for the  Home\r\n\r\nTeam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there are grassroots organisations formed, the\r\n\r\nbonds  between  the  Home Team and the  community  have  been\r\n\r\nstrengthened through the CSSP.  However, in the case  of  new\r\n\r\ntowns, there is frequently a perception among residents  that\r\n\r\nthe Home Team has not been visible enough, and that they fear\r\n\r\nthat  there is insufficient protection, especially  when  the\r\n\r\npolicy  is  now  not  to build any more Neighbourhood  Police\r\n\r\nPosts  (NPPs),  but  to concentrate on  the  larger  type  of\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police  Centres  (NPCs)  and  mobile  policing\r\n\r\nrather  than  static NPP type of policing.   Nonetheless,  it\r\n\r\nappears that the traditional concept of the policemen on  the\r\n\r\nbeat still strikes a chord of security in many residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Home\r\n\r\nTeam  could look into how police presence can be improved  in\r\n\r\nnew  estates, where residents have a natural tendency to feel\r\n\r\ninsecure  in  their  new  environment.   Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) reinstate foot patrols or bicycle patrols in new\r\n\r\nareas  where there are many new residents and where  the  RCs\r\n\r\nhave not yet been formed;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) purchase more mobile NPPs and station them on a\r\n\r\nregular basis around the new neighbourhoods; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) start house visits early to new residents; in\r\n\r\nfact,  as  soon as they move in and, in any case,  not  later\r\n\r\nthan 6-8 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such visits and patrols increase police presence\r\n\r\nsignificantly and add to the sense of security and well-being\r\n\r\namong the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Community Safety\r\n\r\nand  Security  Programme (CSSP) was started in 1998,  and  it\r\n\r\nbrings  together the grassroots organisations, the  CDCs  and\r\n\r\nresidents with the help of the Home Team to address  specific\r\n\r\nareas  of concern pertaining to security.  I think there  are\r\n\r\nsound   principles   that   underlie   this   approach.    It\r\n\r\nfundamentally   emphasises  that  safety  and   security   is\r\n\r\neveryone's responsibility, and it nurtures the spirit of self-help  and  mutual support within the community.   So  on  all\r\n\r\nthose counts, it is very consistent with Singapore 21 and the\r\n\r\nidea of active citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I have for the Minister is, given that\r\n\r\nthe  programme has been in place for over two years now,  how\r\n\r\nwell  received is it on the ground, particularly amongst  the\r\n\r\nRCs.   Also, last year, there was the suggestion that it  was\r\n\r\ngoing to be extended to schools, and I would like to know how\r\n\r\nthe schools have responded to this initiative, especially  as\r\n\r\nthere  were  some  concerns that schools  might  be  somewhat\r\n\r\nreluctant    because  they  may  be  stigmatised  as   having\r\n\r\nparticular problems and that is why they are participating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also interested to know how the Ministry\r\n\r\nassesses  the  effectiveness of the CSSP.  Is  it  purely  by\r\n\r\ninput  measures,  such as the numbers participating,  or  are\r\n\r\nthere  other  ways  that we can measure  the  efficacy?   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the latest crime statistics show that  the  elderly\r\n\r\nhave  been  particular  targets for cheating  offences.   Has\r\n\r\nthere  been  a  response through the CSSP to this  particular\r\n\r\nform of problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the related issue is police presence which the GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,  Prof. Chin, has also spoken on.  Even as residents\r\n\r\ncome  forward to do their bit, they do look to the police  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to maintain vigilance and protection on the  ground.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard, police presence and visibility is  crucial.\r\n\r\nThe feedback is that residents see less of the men in blue on\r\n\r\nthe ground.  They attribute this to closure of NPPs and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso perhaps to a greater emphasis on police patrols by cars,\r\n\r\nrather  than  by foot or bicycle.  Sir, I do not  think  that\r\n\r\nthis  is confined to just the newer estates.  In general,   I\r\n\r\nhave  received  this  feedback from  various  quarters.   The\r\n\r\nvisibility of the police has an important deterrence value to\r\n\r\nwould-be criminals but perhaps, more importantly, it  has  an\r\n\r\nimportant   assurance  value  for  residents,  assurance   of\r\n\r\nsecurity and general safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures are\r\n\r\nin  place  to ensure that the police continue to  maintain  a\r\n\r\ncertain  level  of visibility on the ground, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthose  areas  of high human traffic where visibility  through\r\n\r\nfoot patrols or bicycle patrols will be much more effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now, our GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,   Prof.  Chin,  talked  about  a   scheme   whereby\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police Posts (NPPs) are closed down  with  the\r\n\r\nopening   of   Neighbourhood  Police  Centres   (NPCs).    My\r\n\r\nconstituency is one of those affected by this scheme,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to reflect some of the feedback I have got from my\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s when we first started this concept of\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police  Post, the NPP has  become  a  familiar\r\n\r\nfeature  in  our neighbourhood,  and it has given the  people\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that the Police is very  friendly  and  pro-residents.  Very good relationship has been built up  between\r\n\r\nthe Police and the residents,  and it has given the residents\r\n\r\na sense of security living there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with this new concept of Neighbourhood Police\r\n\r\nCentre  being implemented, many of these NPPs will be  closed\r\n\r\ndown  and many people are feeling a sense of loss, as  though\r\n\r\nwith the closure of these NPPs, they would lose this sense of\r\n\r\nsecurity.   They do not understand why the Police  must  make\r\n\r\nthese  changes.  Some people are concerned that by so  doing,\r\n\r\nit  would  affect the law and order in the area and would  go\r\n\r\nback to the situation before these Neighbourhood Police Posts\r\n\r\nwere  set up.  The good relationship previously built  up  by\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicemen  in  the  NPPs  and the  residents  would  then  be\r\n\r\ndampened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would answer these queries.\r\n\r\n<br>10.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  thank the Members for their comments on the good work done\r\n\r\nby  the  Home Team, and in particular the Police  which  they\r\n\r\ntalked  about  -  their presence and their relationship  with\r\n\r\nthe  community,  that  there is now  a  very  wide  level  of\r\n\r\nacceptance of the Police friendliness and the way  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  helping  the  public, and serving  their  security  and\r\n\r\nsafety needs on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Chin has mentioned, crime rate has indeed\r\n\r\ndropped very significantly last year.  Last year was in  fact\r\n\r\na  very  good year for the Police in that the crime situation\r\n\r\nwas  under  control,  although we still have  something  like\r\n\r\n30,000 cases of seizable offences reported last year.  But as\r\n\r\na  percentage,  this is a significant drop of something  like\r\n\r\n15%  from that of 1999.  On a per hundred thousand basis, the\r\n\r\ndrop  is  even  more significant, from 924 to 764  cases  per\r\n\r\n100,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, eight of the nine index crimes fell,\r\n\r\ncompared to 1999.  Index crimes are those offences which  are\r\n\r\nused  for  international comparison purposes on the situation\r\n\r\nof  crimes  in other parts of the world.  These are  selected\r\n\r\nfor  their  reliability and higher reporting rates.   In  our\r\n\r\ncontext,  the nine offences in the index crimes  are  murder,\r\n\r\nrape,  outraging  of  modesty, robbery, housebreaking,  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle thefts, snatch thefts, cheating-related offences  and\r\n\r\nrioting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property offences such as housebreaking, robbery, motor\r\n\r\nvehicle   thefts   and   snatch   thefts   also   fell   very\r\n\r\nsignificantly, between 14% and 36%.  The offences of  murder,\r\n\r\ncheating-related offences, outraging of modesty and rape also\r\n\r\ndeclined.   But  the  offence of rioting  recorded  a  slight\r\n\r\nincrease of 4%, after having dropped by close to 33% in 1999,\r\n\r\ncompared to 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang was concerned about youth crime and\r\n\r\nthe  situation of young people not knowing about the  dangers\r\n\r\nof  Internet chats, and so on, the same concern as  expressed\r\n\r\nby  Prof. Chin   -  that young girls are caught unawares when\r\n\r\nthey  engage themselves in IRC chats and eventually get taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of.  There has been a slight increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  such cases reported, but the number is still very  small.\r\n\r\nBut  the main part really is in not just Police having public\r\n\r\neducation  campaign  on  the young  people  but  the  parents\r\n\r\nthemselves  must play a very important part in ensuring  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children,  when they get involved in  Internet  chats,\r\n\r\nknow  what they are doing and educate them of the dangers  of\r\n\r\nmeeting strangers in strange places and unaccompanied.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  Parents Advisory Group on the Internet led by  private\r\n\r\ncitizens and the Police will work closely with them, together\r\n\r\nwith the Education Ministry, on educating our young people on\r\n\r\nthe dangers of such Internet chats, which may eventually lead\r\n\r\nthem to trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the whole, talking about crimes committed by\r\n\r\nyouths,  such as shoplifting, theft, rioting, causing serious\r\n\r\nhurt, these have decreased very significantly.  The number of\r\n\r\nyouths  arrested for shoplifting, which is a major  component\r\n\r\nof the number of crimes committed by the youth, has decreased\r\n\r\nby  16%,  from 1,300 cases to 1,100 cases in the  year  2000.\r\n\r\nThe  number of youths arrested for theft, which also includes\r\n\r\nshoplifting,  has  also  fallen from 2,400  youths  to  1,900\r\n\r\nyouths, and that is a decrease of about 23%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have seen a significant decrease in the number of\r\n\r\nyouths  arrested  for  shoplifting or  theft  which  includes\r\n\r\nshoplifting.   While that is still quite a  large  number,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  with enough of publicity effort on this  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Police to educate the young people, particularly\r\n\r\nworking  very  closely with the schools to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nstudents  know  the rights and wrongs when  they  go  to  the\r\n\r\nshops, and not just be too quick with their fingers and pinch\r\n\r\nthings  that do not belong to them and not paying  for  them,\r\n\r\nthe crimes involving youths and young people have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually not increased.  But I think the perception  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  problem  among the young people  that  there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  youth crime probably is due  to  the  publicity\r\n\r\ngiven  by the media whenever a case happens, and when  it  is\r\n\r\nreported, people get excited about it.  When these cases  are\r\n\r\nhighlighted,  then, of course people will be concerned.   But\r\n\r\nfrom  the number of young people arrested for crimes, we have\r\n\r\nnot seen an increase but we have seen a significant decrease.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we pay very close attention to making sure that\r\n\r\nyoung  people do not go wayward and we try to do as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  educate  them about the dangers  of  committing\r\n\r\ncrimes.   In my Ministry, we have formed an Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Youth Crimes, chaired by Prof.  Ho  Peng  Kee,\r\n\r\nworking together with the Education Ministry, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports, and  the  other  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations.   The whole idea is to engage  the  community,\r\n\r\nplus  all  those  Government agencies that  are  involved  in\r\n\r\neducating  young people or making sure that they do  not  get\r\n\r\ninto trouble, like MCDS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This multi-agency approach actually has worked quite\r\n\r\nwell in that they have come up with many new ideas to cope or\r\n\r\ndeal  with  this  problem of young people committing  crimes.\r\n\r\nThey have also worked with this Parents Advisory Group on the\r\n\r\nInternet.  So we should leave it to such initiatives and  not\r\n\r\nget the Police thoroughly involved in every activity or every\r\n\r\ncrime  that  may impact the public.  Really, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nyoung people, the parents themselves should play an important\r\n\r\npart  in educating their own children and not leaving  it  to\r\n\r\nothers alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a concern expressed by Members that the\r\n\r\nPolice  seem  to  withdraw themselves from the  community  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up Police Centres and closing down police posts,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Goh  Choon Kang said.  Actually, this idea  of  a  Police\r\n\r\nCentre  increases the presence of Police on the  ground.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  reduce the presence of Police on the ground.   The\r\n\r\nNPPs  in the past, we still have them  -   and by the  middle\r\n\r\nof this year, we would have concluded the phasing over of the\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Police Centres taking over a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge  part  of the NPC system  -  we still have  these  NPPs\r\n\r\nuntil  July, and thereafter we will have the NPCs  being  the\r\n\r\nkey  nodes of the Police presence on the ground, supplemented\r\n\r\nby  some  other  NPPs that are still in operation.   But  the\r\n\r\ndifference between the NPP and NPC is that in the  past,  the\r\n\r\nNPPs  were very static operations.  NPP just involved  a  few\r\n\r\nofficers sitting in the post and from time to time, they went\r\n\r\non  house  visits, they went on their feet  or  patrolled  on\r\n\r\ntheir  bicycles.  And even when they were requested to attend\r\n\r\nto a crime scene, they just went there and watched and waited\r\n\r\nfor  their  divisional officers to come.  So we thought  that\r\n\r\nwas  not  a  very  good use of Police resources.   For  every\r\n\r\ntrained  Police Officer should really be right there  on  the\r\n\r\nground  the  moment something happens and do something  about\r\n\r\nit, and not just waiting for an investigator or somebody else\r\n\r\nto come from the Division to start the investigation work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this NPC system has allowed us to pool more of our\r\n\r\nPolice officers together in 32 NPCs, so that with the number,\r\n\r\nthey  can then do their job more thoroughly when they respond\r\n\r\nto  a  particular event or incident.  Let me  assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat with the phasing over to the Neighbourhood Police Centre\r\n\r\nsystem,  there  is  no reduction in Police  presence  on  the\r\n\r\nground.   In fact, the level of Police presence has increased\r\n\r\nwith  the NPC.  And the Police will make their presence  felt\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of  foot  patrols,  bicycle  patrols,  vehicle\r\n\r\npatrols, as there are now more vehicles on the road than when\r\n\r\nwe  had the NPP system.  These vehicle patrols also allow our\r\n\r\nPolice  officers  to  reach a wider  area,  instead  of  just\r\n\r\nwalking  on  foot and reaching a small part  of  the  estate.\r\n\r\nWith  the  communication equipment available  in  the  Police\r\n\r\nvehicles, the patrol vehicles are also deployed to respond to\r\n\r\n`999'  calls  whenever  there is an  incident  reported.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  Police  Task Force  operations  and  the  dog\r\n\r\npatrols also complement this regular Police force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the NPC system, we have four officers from each\r\n\r\nNPC  conducting patrols\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompared  to practically no one doing foot patrols under  the\r\n\r\nNPP  system.  By July this year, we will have more  than  124\r\n\r\nofficers  from  the NPC performing such foot patrols  island-wide.  So the public should see an increase in the number  of\r\n\r\nofficers on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the temporary police post that we\r\n\r\nhave  deployed, or actually we call them mobile police  post.\r\n\r\nWe have deployed these temporary or mobile police posts since\r\n\r\n1997.   They  are basically vehicles and they make  stops  at\r\n\r\nselected  locations at different times of the day.  They  are\r\n\r\ndeployed to meet some very transient or very seasonal demands\r\n\r\nfor  Police  presence, such as when there  is  a  crime-prone\r\n\r\narea, we will set up a temporary or mobile police post in the\r\n\r\nparticular  area.   We have now three such  temporary  police\r\n\r\nposts,  and  by  the end of this year, we will  have  another\r\n\r\nthree  more.   So  we will increase the number  of  temporary\r\n\r\npolice posts by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin mentioned that the residents of new housing\r\n\r\nestates are concerned about the sense of safety and security.\r\n\r\nLet me assure him that the Police is very mindful of this and\r\n\r\nthat  is why we will try to build the Police Centres  in  the\r\n\r\nnew  towns  such as Sembawang and Chua Chu Kang  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.   By  the year 2003, Police Centres  will  also  be\r\n\r\nbuilt in Sengkang, which is another new housing estate.  Even\r\n\r\nbefore  the Police Centres are set up, the Police  will  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  their presence is felt through the deployment  of\r\n\r\nthese  temporary police posts.  I have also asked our  Police\r\n\r\nOfficers to try to work together with HDB to find out who are\r\n\r\nthe  new  residents who move into the new estates  and  visit\r\n\r\nthem  as  soon  as possible, to assure them that  the  Police\r\n\r\nknows that they have moved in and that they are around and if\r\n\r\nthey  need help, there is a particular number which they  can\r\n\r\ncall  to seek assistance.  So that is well in hand.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure  Prof.  Chin and his constituents that the  Police  is\r\n\r\nwell  aware of their concerns and they will do what they  can\r\n\r\nwithin the resources to cope with their demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the sense of public safety in Singapore is\r\n\r\nquite high.  At least in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast   survey  that  the  Police  conducted   -   the  Police\r\n\r\ncommissioned  a private survey firm to conduct  a  survey  in\r\n\r\nlate 1999  -  almost 96% of the respondents, including  those\r\n\r\nfrom  the new housing estates, feel that the general security\r\n\r\nof Singapore is good or, if not, better.\r\n\r\n<br>10.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang is worried about the closure of the\r\n\r\npolice posts when we set up police centres.  We have to  look\r\n\r\nat  the overall deployment of the force, including the siting\r\n\r\nof  the  police  centres  and the police  posts.   In  a  few\r\n\r\ninstances, I have noticed that the police post is just  about\r\n\r\n200  metres away from the new police centre.  In fact,  there\r\n\r\nis  one instance where the police post is just 20 metres away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  police centre.  It does not make sense to  have  a\r\n\r\npolice centre and the police post almost within one minute of\r\n\r\nwalking  distance.  So these posts would have to  be  closed.\r\n\r\nFor  example, the one in Braddell Heights will be closed when\r\n\r\nwe set up a new police centre there.  But the residents there\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  too worried because the police  presence  will\r\n\r\nstill be felt on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of residents in areas where we have the\r\n\r\npolice  centres  seems to suggest that they  now  feel  quite\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with the new police centre system.  And  indeed,\r\n\r\nin  those  areas where we have the police centres, crime  has\r\n\r\nfallen  and  more  residents are  also  getting  involved  in\r\n\r\nensuring  the safety and security of their own neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTwo surveys conducted in 1999 and 2000 showed that almost 90%\r\n\r\nof  the  residents and grassroots leaders who live  in  these\r\n\r\nareas  where  we  have  the  police  centres  supported   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the police centres.  They also  appreciated\r\n\r\nthe  fact that police centres deliver more services and  have\r\n\r\nmore  police presence on the ground than before when we  have\r\n\r\nthe  police post system.  This means that this system is  now\r\n\r\ngaining  acceptance and it is only in the old areas where  we\r\n\r\ndo  not have police centres yet, and people are very used  to\r\n\r\nthe  police posts where they can just go and chat up with the\r\n\r\nfriendly  policeman, that they feel a bit uncomfortable  when\r\n\r\nthey see a bigger station\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  more officers and they do not know who to keep in touch\r\n\r\nwith, and so on.  Let me assure the Member that when we  have\r\n\r\na  police  centre,  we will also delegate  officers  to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the grassroots leaders so that the  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  will know who to contact when they have any  request\r\n\r\nto make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were also asked about the Community Safety and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Programme and how much more involved are  residents\r\n\r\nnow  in  the  safety and security of their own neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs  Prof. Chin has cited the numbers, there are now more than\r\n\r\n500 such Community Safety and Security Programmes.  This is a\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  directly  involve the residents  concerned  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the problems of their own areas  because  each\r\n\r\nneighbourhood faces different problems.  And it is better for\r\n\r\nthe  residents themselves to find out how to deal with  those\r\n\r\nproblems by working closely with the authorities, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  the police or whether it is some other Government agency.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  police  will, together with  the  other  Home  Team\r\n\r\npartners, give them whatever resources they need to do  their\r\n\r\njob.  But the primary initiative must come from the residents\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran's area in West Coast, for example, has a few\r\n\r\nCommunity  Safety and Security Programmes.  But they  can  be\r\n\r\nmuch  more  active than what they are now.  With Mr Iswaran's\r\n\r\nsupport and involvement in encouraging them to be more active\r\n\r\nin  looking  out for issues and problems that  concern  them,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  more  effective in increasing  the  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  among  the  residents.  It  is  important  for  the\r\n\r\nadvisors on the ground also to play their role, and not  just\r\n\r\nleave it to the RCs and the community organisations, to  take\r\n\r\ntheir  own initiative.  If they take an interest, I  am  sure\r\n\r\ntheir residents will take an interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of schools, a year-plus ago, I have asked\r\n\r\nthe Education Ministry to see whether we should not introduce\r\n\r\na  scheme like that to the schools so that, at least,  within\r\n\r\nthe  school community, they can help to improve the sense  of\r\n\r\nsafety and security among the students and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers.  And the Home Team took this to the schools, to the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry,  spoke  to  the  principals   and   many\r\n\r\nprincipals  were very supportive.   Now, we have  42  schools\r\n\r\ndirectly   involved  in  the  school  safety   and   security\r\n\r\nprogramme,  and  they  have come up  with  many  initiatives.\r\n\r\nQuite  a  number of them have been publicised, including  the\r\n\r\nsafe  drive zone within the school's neighbourhood to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  when the children come to school, or when they go home,\r\n\r\nand  when  there are too many vehicles in the school compound\r\n\r\nand  in  the vicinity of the school, how they can ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety of the children who leave or come to the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But numbers alone are not enough, of course. We need to\r\n\r\nhave quality programmes.  With these new initiatives and when\r\n\r\nthey  come  from  the  residents, they feel  that  they  have\r\n\r\nidentified  the  problems and found the solution,  they  feel\r\n\r\nquite proud when they have achieved something.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote an example here. In March last year,\r\n\r\nBlks  55  and  56 of Telok Blangah Drive in West  Coast  GRC,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  also  Mr Iswaran's GRC, were hit by  a  series  of\r\n\r\ndeliberate fires that caused substantial damage to the common\r\n\r\nareas.   More seriously, the fires were potential threats  to\r\n\r\nthe  elderly residents living there.  So the West  Coast  GRC\r\n\r\nleaders  and the town council, together with the Bukit  Merah\r\n\r\nWest  Neighbourhood Police Centre, implemented this Community\r\n\r\nSafety and Security Programme to deal with this threat.  They\r\n\r\nfound  that there were many discarded mattresses, newspapers,\r\n\r\nfurniture which had given the arsonists a lot of materials to\r\n\r\nburn.   So  they  realised  that  these  materials  had  been\r\n\r\ndiscarded by the residents at the staircase landings and lift\r\n\r\nlobbies,  partly because the elderly residents  cannot  carry\r\n\r\nthese  materials,  like mattresses and  newspapers,  down  to\r\n\r\ndiscard  them  in the proper places.  So once  the  principal\r\n\r\nsource of the problem was identified, all the residents  came\r\n\r\nto help and they quickly cleared the staircase landings and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlift lobbies of all these flammable rubbish.  Since then,  no\r\n\r\nfire  has occurred in these two blocks, Blks 55 and  56,  and\r\n\r\nthe  elderly people there now feel much safer.  So this is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  example and yet very effective way of  how  residents\r\n\r\ncan  be involved in their own safety and security without too\r\n\r\nmuch of the police presence on the ground, or too much of the\r\n\r\ncivil defence involvement in this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin expressed concern about foreigners committing\r\n\r\ncrimes.   Let  me assure him that the great majority  of  the\r\n\r\nforeigners,  who  come and work here legitimately  with  work\r\n\r\npermits,  come here to earn a living.  They do  not  come  to\r\n\r\ncommit   crimes.   It  is  only  those  who  try  to  smuggle\r\n\r\nthemselves in illegally and they eventually cannot find food,\r\n\r\nlodging and employment that they may resort to crime.  I will\r\n\r\ntalk  about the illegal immigrant situation afterwards.   But\r\n\r\neven   then,  taking  into  account  that  group  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, immigration offenders plus the legal workers, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreigners who were arrested for crimes  actually\r\n\r\nwent down from 1,700 to 1,450, a drop of almost 16%, and they\r\n\r\naccounted  for  about  9%  of the  total  seizable  offences,\r\n\r\nexcluding immigration offences.  And this has been about  the\r\n\r\nsame over the last five years.  So there has been no increase\r\n\r\nin  the number of foreigners arrested for crimes committed in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how we can tighten border control, like improving\r\n\r\nsecurity screening, for example, we have a very porous border\r\n\r\nand  people  can come in easily by hiding themselves  in  car\r\n\r\nboots  and  we have tens of thousands of vehicles  coming  in\r\n\r\nevery day, it is not an easy task.  But we will acquire X-ray\r\n\r\nmachines  by the end of the year at our Woodlands  Checkpoint\r\n\r\nto   help  us  combat  this  problem.   But  even  with   the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of the X-ray machines, we cannot  screen  every\r\n\r\nvehicle.   Because to do so, we will definitely have  a  very\r\n\r\nlong traffic jam stretching all the way to Johor Baru.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have dealt with all the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the other areas\r\n\r\nthat the GPC has mentioned as a subject that should be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought up is the use of technology by the Home Team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is an instrument for both good and evil. In\r\n\r\ntoday's world of supercomputers and broadband communications,\r\n\r\nboth  law  enforcement agencies and criminals are  locked  in\r\n\r\nbattle  using the latest and most sophisticated  equipment  - one,  of  course,  to prevent detection,  and  the  other  to\r\n\r\nimprove detection.  Technology these days allows fingerprints\r\n\r\nto  be  lifted  off  fabrics, DNA profiles to  be  determined\r\n\r\nthrough saliva or a sliver of hair, faces to be reconstructed\r\n\r\nwith sophisticated software and computers.  At the same time,\r\n\r\ntechnology  allows  criminals  to  hide  their  tracks  using\r\n\r\nencryption, and to coordinate their activities to  use  clone\r\n\r\nphones, to jam communications or radar equipment or to create\r\n\r\ncounterfeit currency or false documents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister how technology has\r\n\r\nbeen  utilised  to  assist  the Home  Team,  particularly  in\r\n\r\ncriminal investigations.  For example, the Minister mentioned\r\n\r\non  a  previous  occasion the possibility of starting  a  DNA\r\n\r\ndatabase for those with criminal records.  Could he update us\r\n\r\non  how  far  this project has gone?  And how  this  type  of\r\n\r\ndatabase would render perhaps other types of criminal records\r\n\r\nunnecessary?  Could he also let us know how the Home Team has\r\n\r\nbeen  reorganised to fight the techno-crooks?   How  has  the\r\n\r\nHome Team leveraged on technology to make them more efficient\r\n\r\nand more effective in the investigation of crime?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Prof. Chin asked how technology can\r\n\r\nbe   used   for  crime  investigation  and  crime  detection.\r\n\r\nCertainly,  as criminals become more sophisticated  in  their\r\n\r\nmethods, the Singapore Police Force must also do likewise  by\r\n\r\nmaking use of technology.   And indeed, the Police will  have\r\n\r\nto stay ahead of the criminals in order to do its job well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recent initiative which the Police has undertaken to\r\n\r\nimprove a crime investigation method, which is the old method\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  photo-fit,  manual  photo-fit,  is  to  come  up  with  a\r\n\r\ncomputerised photo-fit system. In the past, Police took  many\r\n\r\nhours  to  ask  the victim or the witness to reconstruct  the\r\n\r\npossible  facial  features of a suspect  and,  painstakingly,\r\n\r\nPolice  has to search out for the many pieces before  it  can\r\n\r\ncome   to   a  composite  photo-fit.   But  now,   with   the\r\n\r\ncomputerised system, it has reduced the amount of time  taken\r\n\r\nto arrive at this photo-fit in a much faster time.\r\n\r\n<br>10.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police is also updating and upgrading the automated\r\n\r\nfingerprint  identification system, and this new system  will\r\n\r\nhave  features  that add greater value to  the  investigation\r\n\r\nprocess.  For example, again, like the computerised photo-fit\r\n\r\nsystem,   it  will  take  a  much  shorter  time   to   match\r\n\r\nfingerprints  than  the previous method of  checking  on  the\r\n\r\nfingerprints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned some time ago that the police will set up a\r\n\r\nDNA database to complement the use of fingerprints and photo-fits  as  forensic  investigation tools  against  crime.   By\r\n\r\nhaving  a  DNA system, it does not obviate the need  for  the\r\n\r\nother traditional systems because we may not have DNA samples\r\n\r\navailable all the time for analysis.  So we may still  depend\r\n\r\non  other  crime  investigation techniques  like  fingerprint\r\n\r\nsearch  and photo-fit.  The police is working to set up  this\r\n\r\nDNA  database  by the latter half of this year.   DNA,  as  a\r\n\r\nblueprint  of  living  things, is  a  very  powerful  aid  to\r\n\r\ncriminal  investigation, provided of course we get a  sample.\r\n\r\nWith  the  setting  up of this database,  DNA  profiles  will\r\n\r\nanalyse from evidence lifted from the scenes of crime and  be\r\n\r\nmatched  against  those  stored in  the  DNA  database.   DNA\r\n\r\nevidence  is  helpful  not  only towards  solving  major  and\r\n\r\nserious crimes, but also routine crimes as well.  DNA samples\r\n\r\nwill be taken from persons arrested for registrable offences,\r\n\r\nsuspects in relation to registrable offences who were  placed\r\n\r\nunder  arrest, and also people, eg, the police  officers  who\r\n\r\nhave access to the crime scene, so that they do not rule  out\r\n\r\nany  particular  group  of  people,  and  they  can  have   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive set of DNA prints for matching.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police is now working with the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers, the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, and\r\n\r\nother   relevant  agencies  to  sort  out  the   operational,\r\n\r\ntechnical, as well as the legal issues involved in setting up\r\n\r\nthis DNA database.  The database will be ready this year  and\r\n\r\nwill greatly enhance the police's investigative capabilities,\r\n\r\nespecially  in solving criminal cases that have few  physical\r\n\r\nleads and few eye-witnesses to rely on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology will not only be used for crime investigation\r\n\r\nand  crime detection but also for many other aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team's  work.  In our departments like  Civil  Defence,\r\n\r\nCentral   Narcotics   Bureau,  the   Prisons   or   Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration  and Registration, there are quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthese  examples  where technology has been deployed  to  good\r\n\r\nuse.   One  is the new Light Fire Attack Vehicle or  what  we\r\n\r\ncall   the  \"Red  Rhino\",  the  small  compact  fire-fighting\r\n\r\nvehicle.  It is the result of the use of technology where  we\r\n\r\nnow do not store the water in the water tank to be carried to\r\n\r\nthe scene of fire, but rather to make use of fire hydrants at\r\n\r\nthe  scene itself, and then have the pumps and motors to  get\r\n\r\nthe water from the hydrant to the fire scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Coast Guard also, for example, has made use\r\n\r\nof  surveillance and radar equipment, electro-optic  cameras,\r\n\r\nand thermal imaging equipment to detect intruders at sea, and\r\n\r\nimaging  x-ray equipment to be purchased by SIR.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nfor  the Prisons, the electronic tag is one example,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  now  looking  at the new version of the  electronic  tag\r\n\r\nwhich may not be so large as the one that is being used now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Members may want to note that we are\r\n\r\nfalling behind schedule on this amendment.  Prof Chin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, according to the\r\n\r\nstatistics, there is still a substantial problem in Singapore\r\n\r\nin illegal immigration.  The Home Team has arrested more than\r\n\r\n16,000  immigration  offenders and overstayers  in  the  year\r\n\r\n2000.  I understand that the Home Team has stepped up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenforcement  action against such offenders.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite clear that these numbers will grow, unless we can  also\r\n\r\ntake  firm  action against those who bring them in,  ie,  the\r\n\r\ntraffickers  or smugglers; those who provide them  with  food\r\n\r\nand  shelter, ie, the harbourers; and those who provide  them\r\n\r\nwith an incentive to come, ie, the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to ask the Minister whether the situation\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  harbourers  and  the  traffickers  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   I  am particularly interested to know whether  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  harbourers  has  gone  up,  despite  the  immense\r\n\r\npublicity that was given to the issue when this House debated\r\n\r\nthe  problem last year and the year before.  Sir, we have  to\r\n\r\nlive  on a different planet to avoid knowing about the  harsh\r\n\r\npenalties  not just for immigration offenders, but  also  for\r\n\r\nthose who help them.  Yet, the perception is that the problem\r\n\r\nhas become worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the media has reported on deacons,\r\n\r\nacademics  and old ladies who are arrested and convicted  for\r\n\r\nharbouring.  Very often, the defence is that they were either\r\n\r\nduped by forged documents, or that they relied on the housing\r\n\r\nagent.   Sir,  these  reports tugged at the  heartstrings  of\r\n\r\nreaders  who see only the personal trauma of the deacon,  the\r\n\r\nold  lady and the academic.  Perhaps, what is needed is a new\r\n\r\nprocedure  on  vetting the bona fides of  foreigners  seeking\r\n\r\naccommodation.  Can a one-stop agency, either at MOM or  SIR,\r\n\r\nor  preferably both, be set up where, for a fee,  say,  about\r\n\r\n$50,  a  validation of a prospective foreign  tenant  can  be\r\n\r\ndetermined?   If a certificate is produced by the authorities\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  person  is a bona fide visitor  or  worker  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then  it  can be presumed  that  the  person  has\r\n\r\nentered and stayed in Singapore legally.  In this way, for  a\r\n\r\nfee,  the worries of would-be landlords can be assuaged,  and\r\n\r\nthe  prosecuting authorities also would have  a  much  better\r\n\r\nidea of whom to prosecute and whom not to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope that we can look into the legislation\r\n\r\nto see whether there is a case for making housing agents, who\r\n\r\nare charged with the duty of verifying the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatus of potential tenants, primarily liable for the offence\r\n\r\nof  harbouring,  rather  than charging  them  as  aiders  and\r\n\r\nabettors.   Sir,  may  I  suggest  that  the  legislation  be\r\n\r\namended, for example, to shift the burden of proof on to  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  to exculpate himself or herself, by simply  showing\r\n\r\nthat  he  or  she has asked a housing agent to check  on  the\r\n\r\nstatus.   If he satisfies this on a balance of probabilities,\r\n\r\nthen  the  housing  agent, and not the  landlord,  should  be\r\n\r\ncharged with the primary offence.  In this way, justice would\r\n\r\nbe  done,  and  the  primary  wrongdoer  would  be  convicted\r\n\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I commend the Home Team for their efforts\r\n\r\nin  controlling the immigration offender problem, but I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the Minister would take further steps, as suggested,  to\r\n\r\nbuttress the law even further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nmentioned,  last year 16,000 illegal immigrants were  caught.\r\n\r\nAlthough the figure cannot be deemed to be very alarming,  it\r\n\r\nremains  to  be  a very worrying problem for a small  country\r\n\r\nlike  ours.   With  some  of  our neighbours  having  serious\r\n\r\neconomic  and political problems, the situation can only  get\r\n\r\nworse.  Apart from security problems, illegal immigrants have\r\n\r\nalso  become  a  peace and safety problem for  our  citizens.\r\n\r\nWhether this fear is real or perceived, somehow it has always\r\n\r\nbeen in the back of our mind that they pose a threat to us in\r\n\r\nterms  of  our personal safety, as well as to our properties.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also  clear that apart from the problem  of  tracking\r\n\r\nthem, if they happen to engage in criminal activities, it  is\r\n\r\nalso  known that the crimes they commit are more violent  and\r\n\r\nserious in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard a lively exchange between my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr Shanmugam, and the Minister of  State  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject   of  mandatory  jailing  of  harbourers  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.   While  I agree that stringent  laws  to  punish\r\n\r\noffenders  who  knowingly  and persistently  harbour  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  are necessary, I would like to know  whether  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team has put in their best efforts to ensure that every\r\n\r\nmeans  is  being explored to prevent these illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nfrom entering Singapore.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfully  appreciate that Singapore, being an island-state,  has\r\n\r\nmany possible entry points to be guarded, and it would be  an\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult task to ensure that these  entry  points\r\n\r\nare made impermeable.  And I must commend the Home Team for a\r\n\r\njob well done so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have to make sure that this problem is\r\n\r\nbrought under control and not let it escalate.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  the  Minister to inform us what new  initiatives\r\n\r\nhave  been  introduced, apart from increasing  the  stringent\r\n\r\nchecks on the checkpoint at the Causeway, constant patrolling\r\n\r\nof  our shores, and the tough laws against illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nas well as those who harbour them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, our\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the foreign workers has been fairly  stringent\r\n\r\nall  the  while.   Therefore, employers  who  employ  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers have to apply for work permits from MOM and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  when  the  permits expire, they have to  take  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary action to repatriate the foreign workers.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  foreign  workers  who  are  overstaying  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  there are some Singaporeans  who  unwittingly\r\n\r\nrent their premises to these overstaying foreign workers  and\r\n\r\nare arrested and sent to prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I have a resident in my constituency who\r\n\r\nencountered this problem.  He advertised to rent out  one  of\r\n\r\nhis  rooms, and a foreign worker came with a photocopy of his\r\n\r\npassport and asked to rent this room.  My resident took  this\r\n\r\ncopy of the passport and checked with the relevant authority.\r\n\r\nHe was informed that the passport was in order.  But not long\r\n\r\nafter,  the police came and arrested him for harbouring  this\r\n\r\nforeign  worker who had overstayed in Singapore, and  he  was\r\n\r\ncharged  in  court.  .  He came to see me.  I  requested  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  further  investigate the  matter.   Finally,  the\r\n\r\npolice  found out that this foreign worker who had overstayed\r\n\r\nhad  actually  used a photocopy of his friend's passport  and\r\n\r\nput  his  photograph on it.  As a result, he  committed  this\r\n\r\ncrime.   I  was  very  glad that the  police,  after  further\r\n\r\ninvestigation, had withdrawn the charge against my  resident.\r\n\r\nI would like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  know  whether the Immigration Department has looked  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and see how their system of checking  could  be\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when we joined National Service, we\r\n\r\nwould surrender our identity card to MINDEF, and MINDEF would\r\n\r\nissue a military IC to us, the NSmen.  Perhaps we should  use\r\n\r\nthe  same  system  for the foreign workers.  The  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  could consider using this system.  Any  foreigner\r\n\r\nwho wishes to work in Singapore must present his passport  to\r\n\r\nSIR.   The  SIR  would then issue a special permit  with  his\r\n\r\nparticulars and photograph on it for him to carry it  as  his\r\n\r\npersonal identity card throughout his stay in Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nwork  permit holder would have to present this special permit\r\n\r\nto  the  landlord when he applies to rent a room.   When  his\r\n\r\nwork  permit expires, and when his stay in Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\nextended,  this  foreign worker would have to surrender  this\r\n\r\nspecial  permit  to SIR to recover his passport  so  that  he\r\n\r\ncould proceed to go home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could also use new technology to examine whether\r\n\r\nthese  foreign workers have overstayed in Singapore,  and  to\r\n\r\ntrack them down for serious charges to be taken against them.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that with such a control system we would be able  to\r\n\r\nreduce the unnecessary social problems to our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Chen said that the illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrant situation is not alarming but it remains  a  matter\r\n\r\nof concern.  Certainly it is a deep matter of concern for the\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs Ministry.  I am sure it is also a great  matter\r\n\r\nof concern for many Singaporeans, particularly if they have a\r\n\r\nneighbour  who has rented out such properties  to  a  foreign\r\n\r\nworker  and they are not sure whether the foreign worker  has\r\n\r\nproper  work  papers to work in Singapore or if  he  is  just\r\n\r\nsimply an illegal immigrant, and they are always very worried\r\n\r\nthat  something would happen in their neighbourhood.  So this\r\n\r\nproblem  of the immigration offender situation is still  with\r\n\r\nus although I would say that it is in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  under control.  The numbers are still quite large.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  immigration offenders arrested was  about  16,500\r\n\r\nlast year.  This is only marginally less than the 17,000 that\r\n\r\nwe  arrested in 1999.  So, there is still a big problem  with\r\n\r\nus  and,  in particular, if you look at the number of illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  who  are  arrested - they  are  not  overstayers,\r\n\r\noverstayers  are  the  ones who come in with  proper  papers,\r\n\r\npassport  and  so on, but they just overstayed -  the  number\r\n\r\nactually has not changed very much compared to 1999.  It  has\r\n\r\nincreased very slightly from 11,500 to 11,650.  Here, we  are\r\n\r\nonly  talking about those who were arrested.  There could  be\r\n\r\nothers who were not arrested.\r\n\r\n<br>11.00 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On overstayers, we have seen a decline by about 10%,\r\n\r\nfrom 5,400 in 1999 to about 4,850.  Mr Chen asked whether the\r\n\r\nHome  Team  has done enough to stop these illegal  immigrants\r\n\r\nfrom  coming in.  I think we have done quite a lot.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to do more.  But Singapore is a very porous place in\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  so  many checkpoints and  we  also  have  a\r\n\r\ncoastline that is not easy to keep watch on, particularly the\r\n\r\nstretch of water between Johor and Singapore, is barely three\r\n\r\nminutes away by speedboat.  Despite that, we will do our best\r\n\r\nin making sure that the problem does not get worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as Singapore's economy continues to grow and so\r\n\r\nlong  as  there are employers and landlords willing  to  give\r\n\r\njobs  to  or harbour these illegal immigrants, we  will  have\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants coming to Singapore, especially when it is\r\n\r\nso  lucrative  for the traffickers to bring  them  in.   When\r\n\r\nthese  people come in, they do not know what they are in  for\r\n\r\nuntil they are arrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we done with regard to enforcement? We have\r\n\r\ngot  daily  police operations to conduct spot checks  on  the\r\n\r\nground  against the suspected immigration offenders in public\r\n\r\nplaces   or   wherever  these  foreign  workers  or   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  are likely to congregate.  We check them  because\r\n\r\nlegitimate and illegal foreign workers do mix around.  These\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndaily  checks by the police resulted in the arrest of  15,000\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders last year.  And altogether,  the  Home\r\n\r\nTeam  mounted 228 immigration offender operations  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of  last  year. Last year,  the  Home  Team  also\r\n\r\ncrippled two syndicates that smuggled illegal immigrants into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These illegal immigrant syndicates  provided  the\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants with forged documents to find  jobs.   17\r\n\r\nsyndicate members and 215 immigration offenders were arrested\r\n\r\nin these two operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sea, the Police Coast Guard has kept up its\r\n\r\nenforcement,  both in the southern, as well as  the  northern\r\n\r\npart  of  Singapore.   We  have got  high-speed  interception\r\n\r\nboats,  together with the latest surveillance equipment.   We\r\n\r\ndeploy  the  latest radar surveillance systems  and  electro-optic  cameras  at  strategic  locations  to  detect  illegal\r\n\r\nlandings  at night.  Last year, we detected 71 such  landings\r\n\r\nand sea interceptions, compared to 52 in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Woodlands Checkpoint, there are more checks now\r\n\r\non suspected vehicles which bring in illegal immigrants. That\r\n\r\nresulted  in  the arrest of 87 illegal immigrant traffickers.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  many of the leaders of traffickers are  not  the\r\n\r\nones who bring these illegal immigrants in.  These syndicates\r\n\r\noperate in the northern part of Singapore, Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no action is complete if we, say, just target\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants.  We have to also target those  who  give\r\n\r\njobs  to  the  immigration offenders, as well  as  those  who\r\n\r\nharbour  them.   Last  year,  590 people  were  arrested  for\r\n\r\nharbouring immigration offenders, compared to 306.  So  there\r\n\r\nis  an increase.  That is in answer to Prof. Chin's question.\r\n\r\n572   were  arrested  for  employing  immigration  offenders,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  388 in 1999.  This increase in arrests  can  be\r\n\r\nattributed  to  the information provided by  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  the  neighbours and others who know or  who  suspect\r\n\r\nthat  the  employer  or the landlord has  given  jobs  to  or\r\n\r\nharboured  the  immigration offender.  Here, I  cannot  over-emphasise the critical role that the public plays in  helping\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  the Home Team to deal with this  problem  of\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many avenues already available for homeowners\r\n\r\nand  employers  to  check  the immigration  status  of  their\r\n\r\nprospective tenants.  Prof. Chin suggested a one-stop centre.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  law  requires due diligence  requirements  to  be\r\n\r\nexercised  by  checking the passport, the original  documents\r\n\r\nand  also  checking with the employer, last year, I announced\r\n\r\nthat the Manpower Ministry and the Singapore Immigration  and\r\n\r\nRegistration   Department  would  also  provide   information\r\n\r\nthrough the Internet for employers or landlords to check  the\r\n\r\nstatus of these foreign talents.  Since April last year, both\r\n\r\nMOM  and  SIR  have  received about  5,300  and  3,200  phone\r\n\r\nenquiries  respectively.  And since  April  last  year  also,\r\n\r\n2,500  of  them have gone to SIR personally to check  on  the\r\n\r\nimmigration status of the tenants and 4,500 have gone to  MOM\r\n\r\nto verify the authenticity of the work permit cards and other\r\n\r\nemployment  passes of the tenants.  People are  now  becoming\r\n\r\nmore  aware,  and that is good.  If they do not  want  to  go\r\n\r\npersonally and they cannot make a phone call, they  can  also\r\n\r\ndirectly  access  the Internet.  Since the launch  in  August\r\n\r\nlast  year,  15,000 users have already accessed the  Internet\r\n\r\nsystem.  SIR has also directly, or through the Inland Revenue\r\n\r\nAuthority, distributed pamphlets to all homeowners to  advise\r\n\r\nthem  on what to check when they let out their properties  to\r\n\r\nforeign tenants.  We have done as much as we could, but I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that there could be other ways of solving this  problem\r\n\r\nor  helping  us  to  reduce this problem and  I  welcome  any\r\n\r\nsuggestions that Members may have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin suggested that we shift the burden to the\r\n\r\nhousing  agent  whenever a landlord employs a housing  agent.\r\n\r\nWe  are going to amend the Immigration Act to also enable the\r\n\r\nprosecution  to prosecute the housing agent  if  he  plays  a\r\n\r\nmajor  role in helping to secure that tenant, and that tenant\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be an immigration offender.  But that  does  not\r\n\r\nobviate  the  need  for the landlord to  check  the  document\r\n\r\nhimself  because when the case goes to court, it is sometimes\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  for one side to believe the other  when  one\r\n\r\nside's story is just as plausible that \"He never asked me  to\r\n\r\ncheck, etc.\"  We would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire  both  parties to be responsible.  We  are  also  now\r\n\r\nlooking into amending the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has a few suggestions. One of his\r\n\r\nsuggestions  is  that  we  retain  the  passports  of   these\r\n\r\nforeigners  who  come  to Singapore  to  work.   Firstly,  no\r\n\r\nGovernment  authority can retain the passport of a  foreigner\r\n\r\nunless it is through a court order, because that passport  is\r\n\r\nthe property of a foreign government.  Even if the law allows\r\n\r\nus  to  retain  the  passport of a  foreigner,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee  that the person would not overstay.  He can  still\r\n\r\nrun away.  He can still disappear.  And what it would mean is\r\n\r\nthat  we  are landed up with passports which we do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhere to find the persons.  The best thing is to ensure  that\r\n\r\nwe have a different method of making sure that the foreigners\r\n\r\nwho  come  to  Singapore go home.  For a foreign worker,  the\r\n\r\nemployer  has to provide a bond to the Manpower Ministry.  He\r\n\r\ncan  only  take  the  bond back when the  foreign  worker  is\r\n\r\nrepatriated.  So, he has got to prove.  The moment  the  work\r\n\r\npermit  is  cancelled, the foreign worker would  be  given  a\r\n\r\nspecial pass of seven days, and then the employer has got  to\r\n\r\nbring  him to the airport and send him home.  At the airport,\r\n\r\nimmigration  would check and take back the  embarkation  card\r\n\r\nand  special pass from the foreign worker.  Then that  clears\r\n\r\nthe  record  that that person has left.  Those who  have  not\r\n\r\nleft  would then be the number of overstayers who  were  once\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at 4,800 overstayers arrested by the\r\n\r\npolice, we found that more than three quarters of them  (77%)\r\n\r\nwere those who came in with a social visit pass.  That means,\r\n\r\nthey  came in as visitors and were given 2-4 weeks, and  they\r\n\r\noverstayed.   The  number of foreign workers who  overstayed,\r\n\r\nincluding  some who were given special passes, is  only  23%.\r\n\r\nSo  the  problem does not lie with the foreign workers.   The\r\n\r\nproblem lies with the social visitors.  We have more  than  7\r\n\r\nmillion  social visitors in Singapore.  How do we decide  who\r\n\r\nto  go  after?  If he comes in, which is really for pleasure,\r\n\r\netc, how do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  ensure  that  he  provides a bond or that  he  keeps  his\r\n\r\npassport  with us?  I do not think Mr Ang's suggestion  is  a\r\n\r\nvery practical idea.  We have to find other ways.  If Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nhas  better  suggestions to help us  solve  this  problem  on\r\n\r\noverstayers, I will be very happy to hear it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform Members that I\r\n\r\nwill end discussion on this amendment at 11.35 am.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, we are\r\n\r\nplanning for a population of 5.5 million people.  We  have  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of 4 million today, out of which only  3  million\r\n\r\nare  Singapore  citizens.   I suppose  we  could  take  about\r\n\r\nanother   half  a  million  to  one  million  more  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizenship is a much sought after commodity.\r\n\r\nWe  only  need  to  talk to people from China  and  India  to\r\n\r\nrealise  this.   Given the limited numbers available,  it  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable that we should be selective in  whom  we  give\r\n\r\ncitizenship to.  I would like to ask the Minister if  he  can\r\n\r\ntell  us what are the key criteria for Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe process has never been very transparent.  At my meet-the-people  sessions, I have frequently come across cases that  I\r\n\r\nthought  worthy and deserving, but were rejected  time  after\r\n\r\ntime.   Many  of  these  cases  involved  relationships  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   spouses  and  children   born   overseas   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans living in Singapore who have often been rejected\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship without reasons being given.  Some of  these\r\n\r\ninvolved  Singaporeans who have done their  national  service\r\n\r\nand  they become bitter over these rejections for their loved\r\n\r\nones.   In  some cases, we lose them all, as they  decide  to\r\n\r\nmove overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to be more sympathetic in\r\n\r\ncases  involving  relatives and loved ones  of  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSingapore can only be our home if our loved ones are with us.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it is as good as telling them all to emigrate.  We\r\n\r\nhave given PR and Singapore citizenships to families who have\r\n\r\nnot  contributed to Singapore yet.  We took them in on  their\r\n\r\npotential.  We should review our policies involving Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens with roots\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere  and  have already contributed to the country's progress\r\n\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin is not speaking.

Just looking at the  data  over  the\r\n\r\nlast   three  years,  it  shows  that  about  90%   of   such\r\n\r\napplications have been approved, whether it is a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nwoman  or a Singaporean man married to a foreign woman  or  a\r\n\r\nforeign  man.   Only  in  certain  instance  when  there  are\r\n\r\nirregularities  in  the marriage or where they  cannot  prove\r\n\r\nthat  they were married that SIR takes a closer look  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether indeed the child belongs to that Singaporean or  not.\r\n\r\nThere  was one case referred to by Mr Lew and, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nI  am not at liberty to disclose all the details here, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  particular resident did not fully  disclose  his\r\n\r\nrelationship with his so-called wife, who bore him  a  child.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in that case, SIR could not grant  citizenship\r\n\r\nto  that child.  But, in general, SIR always looks favourably\r\n\r\nin  such  cases and grants them citizenship, unless there  is\r\n\r\nsome doubt as to the legitimacy of the marriage.\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But SIR will take it one step further, and they have\r\n\r\ndone  so  in  a  number  of cases by asking  the  Singaporean\r\n\r\napplicant whether he or she is prepared to undergo a DNA test\r\n\r\nto  prove his or her relationship with the child or not.  And\r\n\r\nif  the  person agrees to do so, and if the test  shows  that\r\n\r\nindeed he or she is the natural parent, then SIR will be very\r\n\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, in February 2001, the CNB\r\n\r\nhad  successfully mounted an operation which resulted in  the\r\n\r\narrest  of  eight drug traffickers and 113 drug  abusers  and\r\n\r\nseized  heroin,  cannabis and Ecstasy  tablets.   Altogether,\r\n\r\nthey have carried out three such operations.  I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure  this  is the major factor leading to the drop  in  drug\r\n\r\nabuse cases reported last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although drug abuse cases cannot be a zero sum game, no\r\n\r\ndecrease in such cases can be considered sufficient.  As long\r\n\r\nas there are crimes involving drug trafficking, there will be\r\n\r\na  drug  problem.   In  many  nightspots,  drug  abuse  still\r\n\r\nprevails.  These places are mainly patronised by mostly young\r\n\r\npeople  and, if not checked, can create a very serious social\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing development is the increase in cases\r\n\r\ninvolving catamine or Ice.  As this is a very potent type  of\r\n\r\ndrug,  I would like the Minister to inform us the reason  why\r\n\r\nthis  particular type of drug offenders is on  the  increase,\r\n\r\nand  also give us an update on the profile situation of  drug\r\n\r\naddicts in Singapore.  Is the situation under control?   And,\r\n\r\nin  the  case of drug rehabilitation, can we achieve a better\r\n\r\nrecovery rate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was also news that many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere  arrested  overseas  for drug trafficking.   The  reason\r\n\r\ngiven  was  that foreign syndicates recruit Singaporeans  for\r\n\r\ndrug  trafficking  because Singapore is  deemed  to  be  very\r\n\r\nstringent  in  the  law  against drug  trafficking,  and  its\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  subject  to less stringent  search  when  they\r\n\r\ntravel  abroad.  Is the CNB monitoring the situation, or  has\r\n\r\nany follow-up action been taken to trace their connections in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Has any syndicate, engaging in recruiting  these\r\n\r\ntraffickers, ever been apprehended?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the drug situation has indeed\r\n\r\nimproved  quite  significantly over the last few  years,  but\r\n\r\nthat  does  not mean that we have no more drug  problem.   It\r\n\r\njust  means  that  it  is well under control,  and  CNB  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work very hard to crack the syndicates that bring\r\n\r\nin  the  various types of drugs.  The majority of  the  drugs\r\n\r\nbrought  in  are actually heroin, although we  now  see  some\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  trafficking of  Ice  and  Yaba.   But  the\r\n\r\npercentage  of  Ice traffickers is actually not  very  large.\r\n\r\nLast year, only 9% of traffickers arrested trafficked in Ice.\r\n\r\nBut  the  increase of Ice traffickers arrested last  year  is\r\n\r\n74%.  Ice is primarily brought in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Filipinos who come to Singapore.  So far,  it  seems\r\n\r\nthat   this  drug  is  very  much  confined  to  the  foreign\r\n\r\ncommunity,   just   like  Yaba  for  Thais,   although   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  also  involved in  it.   Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nmainly involved in heroin, cannabis and Ecstasy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as rehabilitation goes, CNB, together with the\r\n\r\nother  agencies in the Home Team working with the  community,\r\n\r\nthe  voluntary  organisations and the half-way  houses,  have\r\n\r\nseen a significant improvement in the rehabilitation rate  of\r\n\r\nour  drug  addicts.  For example, the relapse rate  has  gone\r\n\r\ndown,  from  80% or thereabouts many years ago to just  about\r\n\r\n44%  last year.  But, definitely, more can be done by working\r\n\r\nvery closely with the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen is concerned about drug trafficking in the\r\n\r\nnightspots,  nightclubs  and so  on.   The  National  Council\r\n\r\nAgainst  Drug  Abuse (NCADA) is fully aware of that  problem.\r\n\r\nBut  let  me  say  a  word  of caution  here;  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  problem.  NCADA has launched an anti-drug  abuse\r\n\r\ninitiative  this  year in collaboration with the  nightclubs,\r\n\r\ndiscos,  KTV lounges, bars and pubs to promote this anti-drug\r\n\r\nabuse  message among these nightspot goers.  Ever  since  CNB\r\n\r\ntook  a  very  strict approach with the nightclub  operators,\r\n\r\nthey have been very cooperative in reporting any sign of drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking among their clients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singaporeans trafficking overseas, yes,\r\n\r\nindeed,  there  was  an  increase of  Singaporeans  who  were\r\n\r\narrested  overseas for drug related offences.   Between  1998\r\n\r\nand  1999,  there was a significant increase from 65  to  132\r\n\r\nlast  year.   Last year, 98 were arrested overseas  for  drug\r\n\r\nrelated   offences,  of  whom  53  were  arrested  for   drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking.    Because   of  the   lucrativeness   of   drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking   -   very  good  for  making  money    -    many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do get tempted to be involved as  couriers  for\r\n\r\ntrafficking  drugs for other people.  But we will  work  very\r\n\r\nclosely   with  the  drug  enforcement  agencies   of   other\r\n\r\ncountries,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  Australia,  America, Thailand and so  on,  to  help  in\r\n\r\nminimising this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I ask the remaining Members who want\r\n\r\nto  speak  to  confine  themselves to asking  their  specific\r\n\r\nquestions,  so  that  we can try to cover  as  many  cuts  as\r\n\r\npossible?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in an effort to help\r\n\r\nindividuals who have been on the wrong side of the law and to\r\n\r\nturn  over  a  new  leaf and, as a society,  to  become  more\r\n\r\nforgiving, transparent, yet fair, I think we should fine-tune\r\n\r\nour  criminal  registration  process.   Currently,  a  person\r\n\r\ncarries  a criminal record if he is convicted of any  of  the\r\n\r\nscheduled  offences listed in the Registration  of  Criminals\r\n\r\nAct.   He may have been punished for his crime, gone to jail,\r\n\r\nserved his sentence and even rehabilitated.  But certain jobs\r\n\r\nare still closed to him, because of his criminal record.  For\r\n\r\nexample, if he applies for a vocational driving licence to be\r\n\r\na  taxi or bus driver, the licensing authority will conduct a\r\n\r\nscreening  with the Police Criminal Registration Office,  and\r\n\r\nhis  application will not be approved if the applicant has  a\r\n\r\ncriminal  record,  even records of minor  offences  committed\r\n\r\nmany,  many  years  ago.  He may apply to be  employed  as  a\r\n\r\nsecurity guard, and that will be turned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the rationale for this stance taken by\r\n\r\nthe   licensing  authorities.   Clearly,  a  person  who  has\r\n\r\ncommitted  robbery should not be allowed  to  be  a  security\r\n\r\nguard,  bus or taxi driver.  However, for certain more  minor\r\n\r\noffences  and  especially if he has not committed  any  other\r\n\r\noffences  for, say, a period of 10 years, he should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of doubt that he has indeed turned  over  a  new\r\n\r\nleaf  and  committed to embark afresh  on  a  new  life.   To\r\n\r\ndeprive him of this opportunity would be to condemn the petty\r\n\r\ncriminal for life, forcing him to go back to a life of crime,\r\n\r\nas  he  would  not  be able to secure a  good  job  to  start\r\n\r\nbuilding a good life.  In a sense, he would be paying for his\r\n\r\ncrimes forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other hand, for certain serious criminal\r\n\r\noffences, such as sexual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffences, molest and rape, robbery, drug-related offences,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  public  has  the right  to  know  the  person's\r\n\r\nbackground.   Presently,  we  have  to  rely  on  newspapers,\r\n\r\nreports  or  gossip  to find out whether the  person  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with, or intending to deal with, has been  convicted\r\n\r\nof an offence in the past.  The screening process of checking\r\n\r\na  person's criminal records is not open to the public,  even\r\n\r\non  a need-to-know basis.  It is only available to Government\r\n\r\nauthorities.  Why should that be so, especially in  this  age\r\n\r\nof transparency and full disclosure?  There may be situations\r\n\r\nwhere a person has the need to find out another's background.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering whether to do business with someone or\r\n\r\nto  rent  a  room to someone, or even when you  are  thinking\r\n\r\nwhether  to  let someone take your daughter out for  a  date,\r\n\r\nsurely  you  would want to be able to find out  whether  that\r\n\r\nperson was a trickster or molester.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing private or confidential about a\r\n\r\nperson's  criminal record or background.  For his crime,  the\r\n\r\naccused is charged in open court, and evidence is produced in\r\n\r\nopen  court.  It is not something that he should be  able  to\r\n\r\nhide.  I would like to suggest that these criminal records be\r\n\r\navailable, not just to the police, but to any person who  has\r\n\r\na  need  to  know through a process similar to the bankruptcy\r\n\r\nsearches  that one can do with the Supreme Court registry  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  whether a person has been declared a  bankrupt  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Government has\r\n\r\nannounced that it will encourage recruitment of persons  with\r\n\r\ncriminal convictions in the service.  With this first step, I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government can go further than just making such  a\r\n\r\ndirective.   It should introduce legislation to  expunge  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  records of persons after a certain number of  years\r\n\r\nhave elapsed for some kind of offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon to come across people who did foolish\r\n\r\nthings when they were young, such as shoplifting, joining  in\r\n\r\na  fight after a staring incident, illegal betting, littering\r\n\r\nor even being caught for selling illegal pirated VCDs.  These\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminor offences, done at a moment's folly or weakness.   If  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  repented by not repeating the same  offence,   I\r\n\r\nthink  his criminal record should be expunged after a  number\r\n\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a constituent who has been trying very hard to\r\n\r\nexpunge  her  shoplifting record, because she  believes  that\r\n\r\nthis will help her heal psychologically.  She was accused  of\r\n\r\nstealing  from  a supermarket a compact powder  costing  less\r\n\r\nthan  $15  sometime in the mid-1980s when she was just  fresh\r\n\r\nout  of  school.    She had pleaded guilty  under  tremendous\r\n\r\npressure   from  her  accusers  who  were  security   guards.\r\n\r\nAlthough she later pushed this incident into the recesses  of\r\n\r\nher  mind and went abroad to study, this unfortunate incident\r\n\r\ncame  back  to  haunt her and she abandoned her  studies  and\r\n\r\nreturned to Singapore.  She was emotionally scarred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has tried many avenues, including making an appeal\r\n\r\nto the Ministry of Home Affairs, to expunge her record but to\r\n\r\nno  avail  because, currently, there is no law  to  authorise\r\n\r\nthis.   Legally  speaking,  her  case  had  closed  upon  her\r\n\r\nconviction, as the time to appeal had long lapsed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it appears that the records kept at the CRO\r\n\r\nare  made  available  to all and sundry, and  all  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.   I  wonder if this is correct.   I  have,  from\r\n\r\nexperience,  applied for my constituents who  failed  to  get\r\n\r\npasses just to enter the airport and the seaport, even though\r\n\r\nthey have got employment with transport companies.  They need\r\n\r\nthe  passes  to  get into such places.  As a result  of  some\r\n\r\nminor  offences  in their records, several people  have  also\r\n\r\nfailed to get taxi driver's licences and there seems to be an\r\n\r\ninternal   checking  process  in  Government.    Hence,   the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  such  a record for no matter  how  small  an\r\n\r\noffence  cannot be overstated  -   it will bar a person  from\r\n\r\ngainful  employment for the rest of his life.   I  wonder  if\r\n\r\nthis is the right approach, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, Mr Ong and Mr Chng are concerned that\r\n\r\ndisclosure of criminal records would make it difficult for ex-prisoners to get jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, criminal records are kept by the police to\r\n\r\nfacilitate police investigations.  They are also referred  to\r\n\r\nby the courts when sentencing repeat offenders.  They are not\r\n\r\nfor  public  information.  Therefore, as  a  general  policy,\r\n\r\npolice has not released them to prospective employers.   This\r\n\r\napproach   assists   ex-prisoners  in  their   rehabilitation\r\n\r\nefforts,  and this answers also Mr Ong Kian Min's  point.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  keep the present practice  where  criminal\r\n\r\nrecords are made available to Government departments, not  to\r\n\r\nall  employers.  The current practice is for employers to ask\r\n\r\nfor  a declaration from job applicants whether they have  got\r\n\r\ncourt convictions.  I think that is the right approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, I think there will be curiosity seekers. He\r\n\r\ngave  an  example of a father who wants to screen prospective\r\n\r\nsuitors.   But  I think once you go that way, the  boundaries\r\n\r\nwill  expand  and other people will also make  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nenquiry.   So  for  the purposes of helping  ex-prisoners  to\r\n\r\nrehabilitate, we should keep our present practice.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police provides screening information to employers only\r\n\r\nfor  jobs  that  have public safety or security implications.\r\n\r\nLet  me  assure Members that this is not to put obstacles  in\r\n\r\nthe   integration  of  ex-prisoners  but  to  protect  public\r\n\r\ninterest  and safety.  Mr Chng cites some of these  jobs,  so\r\n\r\nhas  Mr Ong   -  jobs relating to the taxi trade, jobs  where\r\n\r\npeople  have  access  to the airports and  ports,  which  are\r\n\r\nsensitive places where theft can take place and this can  mar\r\n\r\nSingapore's reputation.  So these people who are  working  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas  will  be  screened, not just  directly  in  the\r\n\r\nairport  and  port, but also employees working  in  companies\r\n\r\nwith  access to these places.  Because the principle  is  the\r\n\r\nsame  - they have access to these places where further  crime\r\n\r\ncan be committed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure Mr Ong and Mr Chng that people who are\r\n\r\nbarred from doing these jobs are not barred forever.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  guidelines  where after a certain period  of  time,  the\r\n\r\ndebarment is lifted.  Let me also assure Mr Chng and  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nthat  my  Ministry is constantly reviewing the categories  of\r\n\r\npeople and the periods of debarment so that if need be,  over\r\n\r\ntime,  we can make it easier for people to get back into  the\r\n\r\nworkforce in these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point Mr Ong and Mr Chng made was whether or\r\n\r\nnot records could be expunged after a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  fact, currently the Commissioner of Police  already\r\n\r\nhas  the  discretion to expunge criminal  records  for  minor\r\n\r\noffences.   This  is under section 7 of the  Registration  of\r\n\r\nCriminals Act.  Indeed, he has expunged some of these records\r\n\r\nin the past.  But the point is whether more can be done.  Let\r\n\r\nme  also inform Mr Chng and Mr Ong that we are reviewing  the\r\n\r\nAct  to see how the discretion given to the Commissioner  can\r\n\r\nbe  widened.   And  when  we  do this,  we  will  take  their\r\n\r\nsuggestions into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nbelieve   strongly  in  ensuring  and  maintaining  religious\r\n\r\nharmony  and  that religion is not misused to  fulfil  vested\r\n\r\ninterests.  I would like to ask whether the Government has  a\r\n\r\nscreening  mechanism for preventing non-religious  groups  or\r\n\r\npolitical   groups  to  register  as  a  religious   society.\r\n\r\nRecently,  we have seen cases where companies and restaurants\r\n\r\nuse  religious  names,  causing  discomfort  among  religious\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that the Government consider making\r\n\r\nit  mandatory for all religious groups to be registered to be\r\n\r\ncleared  with the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony?\r\n\r\nThis  will help to ensure that all societies registered under\r\n\r\nthe name of religion are truly religious in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Let me assure Mr Yeo that the\r\n\r\nSocieties Act ensures that we do not allow any group to carry\r\n\r\nout   undesirable  or  objectionable  activities   that   are\r\n\r\ndetrimental to society's interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basically two levels of checks. First,\r\n\r\npre-registration; and second, post-registration.   While  any\r\n\r\ngroup of 10 or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore   persons  can  apply  to  register  a  society,  before\r\n\r\nregistering the group the Registrar will check to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  proposed society's objects and activities would  not  be\r\n\r\ncontrary  to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore\r\n\r\nor  national  interest.  He also consults relevant  agencies,\r\n\r\nsuch as MCDS, if it is a religious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-registration, the society's activities would still\r\n\r\nbe subject to our laws.  If the society is found to have been\r\n\r\nused  for unlawful purposes or purposes prejudicial to public\r\n\r\npeace, welfare and good order in Singapore, the Minister  may\r\n\r\norder the dissolution of the society under the Societies Act.\r\n\r\nHence,  we  do  not generally have a problem with  registered\r\n\r\nsocieties in these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo, however, is concerned that some companies and\r\n\r\nrestaurants  registered with religious names may have  caused\r\n\r\ndiscomfort  among religious groups.  Before  registering  the\r\n\r\nname  of  a  company,  business or  society,  the  respective\r\n\r\nRegistrar will consult the relevant authority, such as Police\r\n\r\nand  MCDS.  For example, if the name contains Islamic  words,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar will consult MUIS.  If a complaint  concerning\r\n\r\nthe registered name is received, the Registrar will evaluate,\r\n\r\nin  consultation with the relevant authorities,  and  if  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  is  a  valid  one, the  Registrar  would  ask  the\r\n\r\norganisation to change its name.  In fact, just recently  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  carried  a report on the  Singapore  Buddhist\r\n\r\nFederation's concerns that some organisations are using names\r\n\r\nassociated  with  Buddhism.  It was also  reported  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Buddhist  Federation  planned  to  write  to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Societies on the matter.  While  indeed  if  a\r\n\r\nsociety  is using a name that is objectionable or misleading,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Societies will, after consulting  with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities, if necessary, direct  the  society  to\r\n\r\nchange its name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last suggestion of Mr Yeo was to refer all such\r\n\r\napplications  to  the  Presidential  Council  for   Religious\r\n\r\nHarmony.   I think the Act designates different purposes  for\r\n\r\nthis Council and as I have assured Mr Yeo already, there  are\r\n\r\nenough mechanisms and checks in place.  So I do not think  we\r\n\r\nshould load the Council with more work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have run out of time on this\r\n\r\namendment.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the option of\r\n\r\nprosecuting  borrowers was considered but not taken  up  when\r\n\r\nthe Moneylenders Act was reviewed in 1993 and again recently.\r\n\r\nWe  felt  that it would be counter-productive because illegal\r\n\r\nmoneylending  would  not be eliminated but  would  merely  be\r\n\r\ndriven   underground.    Currently,  Police   already   faces\r\n\r\ndifficulties from borrowers who are reluctant to cooperate in\r\n\r\nthe  investigations  and  in  any subsequent  prosecution  of\r\n\r\nlenders.  If borrowing is made an offence, no borrowers  will\r\n\r\ncome  forward to give evidence against lenders.  Police  will\r\n\r\nin fact not have an accurate picture of the ground situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Yeo highlights a type of borrower - a person\r\n\r\nwho  has  borrowed and changed his address, but then did  not\r\n\r\nreport  the  change  of address, so that  the  buyer  of  the\r\n\r\npremises  gets  harassed  by the  loan  sharks.   In  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation,  first  and  foremost,  the  borrower  would  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  the offence of not changing his address under  the\r\n\r\nNational  Registration  Act and  is  liable  to  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $5,000  or imprisonment for a term  not  exceeding\r\n\r\nfive  years.   The question really is to find him.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  one  situation where we may need  suggestions  from\r\n\r\nMembers.  Indeed maybe some press publicity will be good,  so\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  can  find  him, then you  can  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and stop him from borrowing further and using  his\r\n\r\nformer address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng wants to raise the time limit for\r\n\r\nSeventh Month dinners from 10.30 pm to 10.45 pm, so that more\r\n\r\nmoney  can be raised for charities.  Currently, the  time  is\r\n\r\n<br>10.30 pm, which is also the time in place for all other\r\n\r\nevents on the ground, such as wayangs and other events.  This\r\n\r\nis a matter of balance.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  people who want a longer time, particularly the  Seventh\r\n\r\nMonth  organisers and participants.  There are also residents\r\n\r\nwho  live nearby who will say 10.30 pm is a good time.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a matter of maintaining this balance.  This  time\r\n\r\nlimit  has  been there for a long time, and we have  enforced\r\n\r\nit,  although with some flexibility.  I think it should  stay\r\n\r\nat 10.30 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question that less money is raised for\r\n\r\ncharities, I would suggest that Seventh Month organisers, and\r\n\r\nmany of them already have done this, use other means to raise\r\n\r\nfunds,  both  in  the Seventh Month setting and  out  of  the\r\n\r\nSeventh  Month  setting.  Indeed, one good  way  for  Seventh\r\n\r\nMonth  organisers to ensure that more funds are raised is  to\r\n\r\nstart  the event early.  Over time, this is happening on  the\r\n\r\nground.  So let us keep it at 10.30 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Chng Hee Kok.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QH 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of immigration offenders apprehended\r\n\r\nlast  year was 16,500.  The number of apprehensions has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  down  since  1998 of 23,000.  The  number  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants has shown a similar trend, from 1998 of 14,700  to\r\n\r\n11,650  last  year.  So also for overstayers, declining  from\r\n\r\n8,300 in 1998 to 4,800 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems like great news. Perhaps we are beginning to\r\n\r\nhave  the problem licked.  However, with the ongoing economic\r\n\r\nand  political problems of our neighbours, and the continuing\r\n\r\neconomic growth of Singapore, it is hard to imagine  that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  continue  to attract an increasing  number  of  such\r\n\r\noffenders  who are prepared to sacrifice their  lives  to  be\r\n\r\nhere.  The question which comes to mind naturally is:  Are we\r\n\r\nbecoming less effective in enforcement action and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffenders  are becoming cleverer, as the statistics  suggest?\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, if the number is going down, does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  are doing a better job at controlling this problem?\r\n\r\nOr  is  it because we are not able to really apprehend  these\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I shall like the Minister to elaborate why he\r\n\r\nthinks the control measures are sufficiently effective at the\r\n\r\nsource,  meaning  the  points  of  entry  and  not,  as   the\r\n\r\nstatistics  suggest, which is that we are less  effective  in\r\n\r\napprehending  such offenders.  The question to be  raised  is\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of effort we had done in 1998 versus last  year,\r\n\r\nie,  did  we have more raids in 1998 than, let us  say,  last\r\n\r\nyear?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Police conducts raids from\r\n\r\ntime  to time and I have mentioned earlier on, they conducted\r\n\r\nabout 280 or 290 operations last year, specifically to target\r\n\r\nat  these areas.  But in their normal patrols, they also look\r\n\r\nat  the places where foreigners tend to congregate and,  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time, check on those to see whether they  are  here\r\n\r\nlawfully  or  not.  So the Police has done as  much  as  they\r\n\r\ncould.  But the Police cannot spend all its resources just to\r\n\r\nlook  for  illegal immigrants and overstayers because,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned,  a lot of people come through  the  Causeway\r\n\r\nevery day, and even if we check everyone who travels with his\r\n\r\npapers,  we  also  have  others  who  hide  in  vehicles  and\r\n\r\nspecially-constructed compartments in trucks and  containers,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   Unless we stop all vehicles  and  check  every\r\n\r\nvehicle,  it  is simply not possible to screen  out  all  who\r\n\r\nattempt to come in one way or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Member here that we will do everything\r\n\r\npossible but within the constraints of our resources to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this problem.

The criteria for  NMPs  are\r\n\r\nsettled  by the Constitution, and interpreted by the  Special\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee of the House that sits to decide who should\r\n\r\nbe  NMPs.   I believe, Sir, there is one important  criterion\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  set out in the Constitution that  should  be.\r\n\r\nThis important criterion is that NMPs should be non-partisan,\r\n\r\nthat is, not a member of any political party, whether of  the\r\n\r\nPAP  or  of an opposition party.  In contrast, this criterion\r\n\r\nis especially set out for the Elected President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is that, I believe, this criterion\r\n\r\nis  actually a very important one.  This is the best  way  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  NMPs  do indeed represent a wide  diversity  of\r\n\r\nviews  as the scheme intends.  It is also a safeguard against\r\n\r\nthe  NMP  scheme  becoming  a  backdoor  to  Parliament,   as\r\n\r\nexpressed by some concerned MPs when the scheme was first set\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point, Sir, is that I would urge Parliament,\r\n\r\nand  especially the committee, to require that all candidates\r\n\r\nfor  NMPship  declare whether they are members  of  political\r\n\r\nparties.   They should weigh very heavily against anyone  who\r\n\r\nis.   More  when a candidate has been a member of a political\r\n\r\nparty  but  has since resigned, they should favour those  who\r\n\r\nhave resigned some time ago, rather than those who resign  on\r\n\r\nthe  eve  of  nomination.  There should, in  a  sense,  be  a\r\n\r\ncooling-off period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose  who  belong  to a political party,  Sir,  should  seek\r\n\r\nelected  office.   NMPs should not be a training  ground  for\r\n\r\nMPs.   They  should  be non-partisan and  seek  to  represent\r\n\r\nindependent views from diverse sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the question of whether an NMP\r\n\r\nshould  be  non-partisan or not, and whether this  should  be\r\n\r\nclearly  stated in the Act, was fully debated in  this  House\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Bill  was  first read  in  1989.    The  Bill  was\r\n\r\nsubsequently submitted to a Select Committee.  We deliberated\r\n\r\nthe  matter quite extensively and, finally, we came  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  House for the Third Reading, and the matter was  debated\r\n\r\nagain in March 1990.  And as the Prime Minister said, we want\r\n\r\nthe Nominated MPs to be non-partisan and that we would prefer\r\n\r\nthat   to   be  written  in  the  Constitution.   But   after\r\n\r\ndeliberation  in  the Select Committee, the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nfelt  that it was not necessary to have it written into  law,\r\n\r\nbut we should evolve this through practice and convention  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the candidate or the person being nominated to\r\n\r\nbe an NMP should not belong to a political party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from the nomination form whether a person\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  any political party or not, because  I  remember\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  particular column that requires  him  to  state\r\n\r\nwhether he is a member of a political party.  There had been,\r\n\r\nin  the past, some candidates or nominees who were members of\r\n\r\na  political  party and they had, by practice, resigned  from\r\n\r\nthe political party before they became an NMP.  But to be  so\r\n\r\npurist to say that we should not have anyone who has belonged\r\n\r\nto  a political party to be even considered for an NMP unless\r\n\r\nhe  has resigned from the party for a certain period of time,\r\n\r\nI think we are just minimising the pool of people that we may\r\n\r\nhave  available  who may represent a certain segment  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  from being present in this House to speak  up  on\r\n\r\ntheir  behalf, or to state their views about certain  issues.\r\n\r\nSo  while we want to evolve this, we should at the same  time\r\n\r\nguard  against  limiting ourselves not finding  the  suitable\r\n\r\ncandidate just because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  person happens to be a member of a political  party  for\r\n\r\nsome time and has only recently resigned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, can you withdraw your amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Lew.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head F of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code FA 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most backbenchers, like myself, are working people.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to juggle between work in the office, parliamentary\r\n\r\nwork,  grassroots  work  and family.   We  need  support  for\r\n\r\nresearch  and  other  secretarial  duties  so  that  we   can\r\n\r\ndischarge  our  political responsibilities  and  duties  more\r\n\r\nfully.   I  am sure you like us to be more active in debating\r\n\r\nBills in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, allowances for legislative and\r\n\r\nsecretarial  assistants were introduced to help  backbenchers\r\n\r\nto  employ  help.   We started with $500  for  a  legislative\r\n\r\nassistant and $250 for a secretarial assistant.  Since  then,\r\n\r\nthe amounts have gone up to $550 and $275 respectively, which\r\n\r\nis  10%  increase in 10 years.  This works out  to  about  1%\r\n\r\nincrease per year.  This amount includes the employer's share\r\n\r\nof  CPF  which  means that the net amount they take  home  is\r\n\r\nsubstantially lower after deduction of CPF.  It is  difficult\r\n\r\nto  employ anybody with relevant experience with these  small\r\n\r\nsums nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many Parliaments overseas, I know that MPs get\r\n\r\nallowances for the full-time employment of two to three aides\r\n\r\nand  assistants.  I am not asking for that right now.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink we can afford a little more so that we can employ  some\r\n\r\npart-time  assistants with more experience  and  quality.  It\r\n\r\nwould certainly uplift the quality of our work which seems to\r\n\r\nbe  increasing  all the time.  The volume  of  our  work  has\r\n\r\nincreased with the formation of town\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncouncils,  the GRCs, the Community Development Councils,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  We are now even doing charity work as well, that is,\r\n\r\nfund-raising for charity.  I do not know what would be  next.\r\n\r\nBut  I  know  that it will not get any lighter.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will review this sympathetically.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we recognise that the last\r\n\r\nrevision  of  the  legislative  and  secretarial  assistants'\r\n\r\nallowance  was  way back in 1993.  And when we first  started\r\n\r\nthis  scheme  in 1989, or thereabout, it was  only  $250  for\r\n\r\nsecretarial  assistants and $500 for legislative  assistants.\r\n\r\nEven  in those days, the $750 would not enable the Member  to\r\n\r\nemploy somebody who is fully qualified to do the job for  him\r\n\r\nin  researching  materials for his speeches,  etc.   So  that\r\n\r\nallowance  is actually a small sum of money to  help  him  to\r\n\r\ndefray  part  of  the wages that he pays his legislative  and\r\n\r\nsecretarial  assistants.  It is not  meant  to  be  the  full\r\n\r\nsalary for a staff assistant for him.  Of course, after eight\r\n\r\nyears,  I  should say that we will look into that  again  and\r\n\r\nfind an opportunity to increase the sum of money.  But I hope\r\n\r\nthat  Members do not expect that we will revise  the  sum  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an  extent that will enable them to pay  for  the  full\r\n\r\nsalary of the assistants.

I  note  that  of the amount  allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,   $1,200  million  is  in  the  form  of  operating\r\n\r\nsubventions to the restructured institutions of the  National\r\n\r\nHealth  Group  and  the Singapore Health  Services.   Between\r\n\r\nthem,   they  are  responsible  for  all  the  public  sector\r\n\r\nhospitals,  national  centres  and  polyclinics.   They   are\r\n\r\nautonomous  bodies  responsible for their own  bottom  lines.\r\n\r\nWhat  may not be evident to the public is that they are  very\r\n\r\nsubstantially   subsidised  by  the  Government,   especially\r\n\r\npatients from a lower income category.  It would be useful if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister can elaborate on the main components  of  these\r\n\r\nsubventions  to  the  two restructured institutions  and,  if\r\n\r\npossible, highlight the extent of the subsidies to the  lower\r\n\r\nincome groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, can I move to the next item?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will propose the question first.\r\n\r\n[Question accordingly proposed.]  Mr Chen, please continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> The increase in health expenditure is\r\n\r\nas  inevitable  as  the sun rises.  The major  part  of  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  on manpower.  Doctors and nurses  and  other\r\n\r\noperational  staff  have to be paid at  market  level  wages.\r\n\r\nThey have to compete with other demands for the scarce labour\r\n\r\nresources.   With  our  extremely  tight  labour  market   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we are not talking about single digit  increases.\r\n\r\nThe  days  of regular small increases are over.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider not only salary increases but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbonuses  as  well.  We can try reducing labour usage  through\r\n\r\nhigher productivity and mechanisation.  In healthcare,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  limit  to  mechanisation,  as  healthcare  is  a  very\r\n\r\npersonalised affair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increases in manpower expenditure will continue to drive\r\n\r\nhealth  costs higher over the years.  Increases in  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges will not be able to cope with these increasing  costs\r\n\r\nwhich  would lead to more subsidies.  I would be grateful  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  can  give  us an idea  how  the  increases  in\r\n\r\nmanpower expenditure have impacted the budget, especially  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  increases in subsidies, to  meet  the  rising\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> In the ensuing years,\r\n\r\nSir, we can expect increased demands on our healthcare system\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of  higher needs of a fast ageing  population,\r\n\r\nhigher expectations of an increasing affluent population  and\r\n\r\nhigher usage of new medical advances.  The cost of healthcare\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  cause  for concern as we face the  challenge  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  affordable quality healthcare that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave grown accustomed to.  Sir, planning and spending now  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  issue will save us millions of dollars  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has increased the FY2001 budget\r\n\r\nallocation  for  the  Ministry of Health  by  31%.   This  is\r\n\r\nheartening  and I would like to urge the Minister for  Health\r\n\r\nto  spend not only on immediate healthcare needs but also  on\r\n\r\nthe  foundations that will take care of our future healthcare\r\n\r\nconcerns.   In  this respect, I have several observations  to\r\n\r\nmake as follows:\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Healthcare Expenditure, which formed about\r\n\r\n3.1%  of GDP in 1999, amounted to $4.4 billion or $1,370  per\r\n\r\ncapita.  The public healthcare expenditure is 1.1% of GDP and\r\n\r\nthe  private healthcare expenditure is 2% of GDP or twice the\r\n\r\namount spent by the Government.  This contrasts significantly\r\n\r\nwith that in England where the private share is only 1/6,  in\r\n\r\nAustralia where the private share is only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf,  and  in  Hong  Kong and Malaysia where  the  ratio  is\r\n\r\nroughly one to one. Sir, the healthcare burden on the  people\r\n\r\nis high in Singapore and we should try to lessen this burden.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  may  like to consider having  more  healthcare\r\n\r\nbenefits for children.  Such a reduction of healthcare burden\r\n\r\non the people may induce more couples to have more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we cannot arrest the rising medical demands and\r\n\r\nthe  increasing costs of healthcare, our challenge is to find\r\n\r\nall  avenues  available  to lessen  the  need  for  expensive\r\n\r\nmedical  care.  It would appear that the basic tenets  for  a\r\n\r\ngood  and  affordable healthcare system seem to rest  upon  a\r\n\r\nsystem that enables us to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. maintain our population as healthily and for as\r\n\r\nlong as possible;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. ensure the elderly population remains as\r\n\r\nindependently as possible;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. ensure the appropriate use of our medical care\r\n\r\nwithout wastage; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. emphasise on self-help and that people are\r\n\r\nresponsible for their own health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must go beyond rendering remedy only when\r\n\r\nsickness strikes.  We need preventive care.  It is crucial to\r\n\r\npromote preventive care with more resources provided for  it.\r\n\r\nThe Community Health Screening programme, embarked by MOH for\r\n\r\ncitizens  above 50 years of age, is on the right track.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge  now is to facilitate those diagnosed with  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  chronic  diseases  to  go for long-term  follow  up  and\r\n\r\ntreatment.   Failure here would make the  whole  programme  a\r\n\r\nwaste of time, effort and money.  Perhaps, we should consider\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  either through MOH or CDC, to defray  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncosts for those who really cannot afford long-term treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had previously asked in this House that more help be\r\n\r\ngiven to voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) so that  they\r\n\r\nhave  less fund-raising burdens.  Fund-raising can be a  very\r\n\r\ntedious  task  indeed.   It  gets  harder  each  year,   with\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof fund-raising events.  It detracts the VWOs from their good\r\n\r\nwork  in  caring  for  their charges.  I sincerely  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health will accede to my request to  give  them\r\n\r\nmore help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo has\r\n\r\nalready touched on our public expenditure on healthcare being\r\n\r\n1.1% of GDP and that the private expenditure was 2%, giving a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 3.2% in 1999.  This is indeed lower than what other\r\n\r\ncountries  had  spent  during  the  same  stage  of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment as we are.  Yet the Minister has pointed  out  in\r\n\r\nthe  House, during the debate on the constitutional amendment\r\n\r\non NII, that if we measure the outcome of healthcare delivery\r\n\r\nsystem,  in  fact, our healthcare delivery system ranks  very\r\n\r\nhigh  against  the  various  international  benchmarks.    It\r\n\r\nstrikes  me  that  Singaporeans must  be  very  efficient  to\r\n\r\nachieve  such  a  high  standard when we spend  comparatively\r\n\r\nquite a little amount in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is: what are we doing right that others\r\n\r\nmight  not be doing?  One possibility is that ours is a city-state   with   limited  geographic  areas,   and   thus   the\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  costs of the public health  delivery  system\r\n\r\nmust  be  low  compared to other countries with  large  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  Another possibility is that perhaps our environmental\r\n\r\nhealth  is  very good, thereby minimising the expenditure  on\r\n\r\nactual   health   delivery.   But,   maybe,   another   third\r\n\r\npossibility  could  be  that  we  might  be  underpaying  our\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers, such as nurses and doctors in the  public\r\n\r\nhealth  delivery system, thereby leading to  low  morale  and\r\n\r\nhigh  attrition.  There were reports indeed in the newspapers\r\n\r\nseveral  months back that some of our doctors are  regretting\r\n\r\ntheir career choice, for having chosen to become doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that in the FY2001 Budget, the operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure allocated for the Ministry of Health is going  to\r\n\r\n$1.46  billion,  a whopping 34.5% increase  over  last  year.\r\n\r\nThis is, in fact, the highest increase in percentage terms of\r\n\r\nall  Government  ministries, and I hope  that  part  of  this\r\n\r\nincrease would go towards\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsalary adjustment in the public health sector so that doctors\r\n\r\nand  nurses could look forward to some recognition  of  their\r\n\r\ncontribution.   The  question I would like  to  pose  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister is a simple one.  How did we spend so little and yet\r\n\r\nachieve so much?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I want to bring a\r\n\r\npractical  approach to this issue.  We have given the  people\r\n\r\nthe  assurance that healthcare is affordable to all.  We have\r\n\r\nMedisave, MediShield and other insurance coverage to pay  for\r\n\r\nhealth   bills.    Yet  we  get  the  common   refrain   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans cannot afford to fall ill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked at some of the hospital bills and I am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that, as a Government, we have actually  done  our\r\n\r\nbest  for  those patients in C and B2, where the  subsidy  is\r\n\r\nsubstantial.  Let me give you an example.  A two-day stay  at\r\n\r\nNUH  for the investigation of a chest pain in a 6-bedded ward\r\n\r\ncosts  $1,272.   However,  after the  Government  subsidy  of\r\n\r\n$1,026,  this patient paid only $244, which was paid  by  her\r\n\r\nhusband's  Medisave.  So in the end she did not have  to  pay\r\n\r\nany  cash top-up.  Similarly, when she was admitted for a day\r\n\r\nsurgery  to do a coronary angiogram, she only paid  $5  cash.\r\n\r\nHer husband's Medisave deduction was $519 although the actual\r\n\r\ncost to Government was $1,890, a subsidy of $1,365.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, there is a substantial subsidy for C class patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we hear Singaporeans complaining of having to pay\r\n\r\nhuge hospital bills, including outpatient hospital bills.  It\r\n\r\ncould  be  that  such  patients do not have  enough  Medisave\r\n\r\nsavings,  or  they  do  not know the system  well  enough  to\r\n\r\nmaximise its full benefits.  And this is where I will try  to\r\n\r\ngive  some  advice  to  some of these patients,  and  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain  this  later.  The above patient is my taxi  driver's\r\n\r\nwife  and  he knows the healthcare delivery system well  and,\r\n\r\nthus,   avoided   the  many  pitfalls  that  many   unknowing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans get into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two categories of patients seeking\r\n\r\nhospital  treatment.   One,  the acute,  ie,  the  very  sick\r\n\r\npatients,  and  the less acute, or the cold  cases.   In  the\r\n\r\nacute cases, the patient goes to the A&E Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis  frame  of  mind is one of anxiety and fear.   He  cannot\r\n\r\nthink  straight  and  he is eager to get  hospitalised.   His\r\n\r\nrelatives are equally worried and stressed, and this is where\r\n\r\nhis  choice of ward, which should be C or B2, is upgraded  to\r\n\r\nB1  or even A class.  Children of the patient are prepared to\r\n\r\nuse  their  Medisave to help out and so, at that moment,  all\r\n\r\ncaution is thrown to the wind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission to B1 or A, without any subsidy, would be very\r\n\r\nexpensive.  Thus, instead of having to pay only $244 for a 2-day  stay,  like my taxi-driver friend's wife,  this  patient\r\n\r\nwould  have  to pay $1,272 for a similar 2-day stay.   In  an\r\n\r\nacute case, it is quite understandable for someone to make  a\r\n\r\nwrong choice of hospital wards, because the circumstances are\r\n\r\none  of  urgency.  Nevertheless, it could be avoided if  they\r\n\r\nare  aware  of  the implications.  However, in a  cold  case,\r\n\r\ngoing to get admitted to A or B1, when you cannot afford,  is\r\n\r\nwrong and, in fact, stupid.  Ill advice by relatives, who are\r\n\r\nnot  paying  the bills, is quite common.  Some  children  put\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  in  A  or B1 because  they  think  they  have\r\n\r\nMedisave,  and  they  want to give the  best  care  to  their\r\n\r\nparents.   This is very laudable.  Some do not want  to  lose\r\n\r\nface  if  they  stay  in  C or B2, or  relatives  might  pass\r\n\r\ncomments.  The ones I dislike most are those giving the  most\r\n\r\nexpensive advice and they are not paying the bills.  Choosing\r\n\r\nthe wrong wards can be very costly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having opted for the expensive wards is not the end\r\n\r\nof the story.  Many are not aware that this is not a one-time\r\n\r\ncost.   A  subsequent  follow-up at the  specialist  clinics,\r\n\r\nafter  they get discharged, is also not subsidised, and  they\r\n\r\ncannot  use  Medisave and this is where  those  on  long-term\r\n\r\nfollow-up, like those with hypertension, diabetes  and  heart\r\n\r\ncases will continue to pay high specialist consultation  fees\r\n\r\nand  high cost of surgical and medical procedures done at the\r\n\r\noutpatient  level.   This policy of no downgrading  once  you\r\n\r\nhave  opted for the expensive wards, like A or B1, is closely\r\n\r\nadhered to by most hospitals.  This is where I appeal to  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndowngrading  those  who are retrenched, lost  a  job  through\r\n\r\nstroke or accident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know that this has been given, but of course more\r\n\r\ncan be done.  For example, many workers who opted for A or B1\r\n\r\nclass  while working, because of insurance coverage by  their\r\n\r\ncompanies, lose this privilege when they retire.  This is one\r\n\r\ngroup  of  workers  who should be allowed to  downgrade  upon\r\n\r\nretirement.   My  advice  is:  Singaporeans  must  ask  about\r\n\r\ncosts.  Know the healthcare system well.  And, as doctors, it\r\n\r\nis our responsibility to explain to patients the cost options\r\n\r\nof  a  direct  referral to hospital specialists, or  indirect\r\n\r\nreferral  through  the outpatient clinics  to  hospitals.   A\r\n\r\ndirect referral by a general practitioner to any restructured\r\n\r\nhospital  is  a  very  expensive way.  An  indirect  referral\r\n\r\nthrough the polyclinic is the least expensive route.  At  the\r\n\r\nhospital end, counter staff at A&E must pay special attention\r\n\r\nto  explain  to  patients the difference in  pricing  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  hospital  wards  before  admission.   At  Government\r\n\r\nlevel,  Singaporeans must be assured that C class  wards  are\r\n\r\ngiven equally good medical care but without frills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one area which I would like to talk about - that is over-prescribing of drugs. Many a time, a patient\r\n\r\nwill  bring a plastic bag full of medicine from the hospital.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not  cheap drugs, most having to purchase  at  the\r\n\r\nhospital  pharmacy, and the supply is usually a  month  to  3\r\n\r\nmonths.  It costs hundreds of dollars at times, especially if\r\n\r\nthe  patient is multi-diseased, ie, they receive  drugs  from\r\n\r\nthe  cardiologist,  from the diabetic  specialist,  from  the\r\n\r\nkidney  specialist.  The poor patient is  usually  so  groggy\r\n\r\nafter  the drugs he has to take and, sometimes, when I ask  a\r\n\r\npatient whether he informed the various specialists about the\r\n\r\ndifferent  kinds  of  drugs he has to  take,  invariably  the\r\n\r\nanswer  by the respective specialists is, \"You just  take  my\r\n\r\ndrugs.\"   If  there is a drug interaction, that can  be  very\r\n\r\nserious.   Usually  such  patients,  unfortunately,  are  not\r\n\r\neducated, and they have no ways and means to argue  with  the\r\n\r\ndoctor or to seek better advice from the doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most specialists or some specialists guard their turf\r\n\r\ntoo closely and, at times,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sure, inter-relationships between physicians break down,\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of the patient.  My suggestion is  that  the\r\n\r\nclinical pharmacists should alert the physicians if they come\r\n\r\nacross  such  cases,  so  that a more  rational  approach  to\r\n\r\nmanagement can be achieved.  Moreover, it is not wise to give\r\n\r\nthem  one to two or three months' supply.  I think we  should\r\n\r\nstart  off by just giving them two weeks of medicine to  find\r\n\r\nout whether they do agree to the medicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation, however, is sometimes complicated with\r\n\r\nthe  patient  seeing  doctors from two  different  hospitals.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, with the two clusters, from two different hospitals\r\n\r\nin  two  different clusters, this is where we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nquickly rationalise how we are going to manage such patients.\r\n\r\nMy  suggestion  is  that there must be a transparent  medical\r\n\r\nrecord  system to help overcome such problems so that medical\r\n\r\nrecords  of those in one hospital can be passed on to another\r\n\r\ndoctor  of  a  different hospital in a different cluster  for\r\n\r\nbetter patient care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, is that doctors are now practising\r\n\r\ndefensive medicine because of the fear of being sued ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Tan, you have used up your\r\n\r\ntime.  Mr Shanmugam is not here.  Mrs Lim.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as my colleague,\r\n\r\nDr  Neo  has  mentioned, the Singapore population  has  grown\r\n\r\nincreasingly affluent and their medical needs have  risen  in\r\n\r\ntandem.   Given our small size, and unlike elsewhere, medical\r\n\r\nattention  is  always within easy reach and there  may  be  a\r\n\r\ntendency to over-consume.  Yet, there is an expectation  that\r\n\r\nmedical  services must remain affordable.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nraise  some  common  concerns and  perceptions  and  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  clarify  the philosophy behind  each  of  these\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the role of restructured hospitals. Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  feel that restructured hospital  services  must\r\n\r\nremain affordable as they are, after all, owned by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  they always have been.  Many  are  not  clear\r\n\r\nabout  the positioning of the restructured hospitals,  vis-a-vis  private hospitals.  In fact, some, especially the  older\r\n\r\npersons, continue to view the difference as that between  the\r\n\r\npolyclinic and the general practitioners or specialists.  The\r\n\r\nconfusion  could  have  stemmed  from  the  co-existence   of\r\n\r\nsubsidised services at restructured hospitals.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister whether there is any merit to  creating\r\n\r\nseparate   identities  to  help  differentiate  the  services\r\n\r\nalthough   operationally,  there  is  the  same   degree   of\r\n\r\nintegration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, the financial model of a restructured\r\n\r\nhospital can be a challenging one, in that there is the  risk\r\n\r\nof  presenting  a  moral  dilemma for doctors.   Restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals   presumably   require  all  employees,   including\r\n\r\ndoctors,  to  be  conscious of the bottom line.   Unless  the\r\n\r\nsubvention for subsidised patients were accounted  for  in  a\r\n\r\nway  as  to  make  the difference between the  revenues  from\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and  private patients less  marked,  there  would\r\n\r\nalways  be  financial pressure to achieve  a  higher  mix  of\r\n\r\nprivate  patients.   Could the Minister  please  clarify  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy behind the role of restructured hospitals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the choice of wards and services. Sir, like\r\n\r\nDr  Tan,  I  have encountered numerous cases where  residents\r\n\r\nchecked  their parents into a higher class ward only to  have\r\n\r\nto  appeal  to the hospitals to have them downgraded  as  the\r\n\r\ncosts  turned out to be beyond their ability to  bear.   Most\r\n\r\nrequests  for  downgrading, as I understand, would  typically\r\n\r\nfail.  On the flip side, there are also cases where admission\r\n\r\nto  a higher class is sought in order to jump the queue, with\r\n\r\na subsequent request made to be downgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This downgrading phenomenon raises several issues.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  many Singaporeans are guided by emotions when  they\r\n\r\nare  confronted with an urgent decision on ward class, as  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  has elaborated on, for a loved one.  Not to opt for  the\r\n\r\nbest  class  for  an  elderly parent when there  are  several\r\n\r\nchildren with Medisave funds appears to be a less-than-filial\r\n\r\nact.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as many do not use hospital services on a\r\n\r\nregular  basis,  as  to  what a ward  class  entails  can  be\r\n\r\nsomewhat mysterious.  Many have equated a lower ward class to\r\n\r\npoor or inferior care.  It would be good if the Minister  can\r\n\r\nclarify  what the suite of services are for each  ward  class\r\n\r\nand  what  the  differences are,  as  well  as  what  minimum\r\n\r\nstandards   would   be   maintained  regardless   of   class.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  like  Dr Tan, I would like  to  ask  that  some\r\n\r\ncounselling  be given to guide family members in  making  the\r\n\r\nmost appropriate and rational financial decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the degree of subsidy. Currently, the needy\r\n\r\nare  being helped via the Medifund administration. The  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups  have  of  late raised  concerns  about  their\r\n\r\nability  to afford healthcare service. This chorus is  likely\r\n\r\nto  intensify  with  the ageing of the  population.  In  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there  is\r\n\r\nmerit  to determining by way of, say, a means or income test,\r\n\r\nthe degree of subsidy at restructured hospitals.  Admittedly,\r\n\r\nthis  would be difficult to administer but it would hopefully\r\n\r\nextend subsidised care equitably.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, in Singapore, we have\r\n\r\nestablished a good healthcare financing system based  on  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  of  individual responsibility, coupled  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  subsidies to keep basic  healthcare  affordable\r\n\r\nfor  all  people.   Through  the  years,  we  have  developed\r\n\r\nMedisave, MediShield and Medifund that will ensure that every\r\n\r\nSingaporean will have access to basic medical care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these systems still need to be fine-tuned and\r\n\r\nreviewed from time to time.  I would like to inquire  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health  will be reviewing  its  policy  on\r\n\r\nMediShield.  I have seen cases where people find it difficult\r\n\r\nto claim for MediShield due to the stringent criteria set for\r\n\r\nthe claim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also review the deductibles. The present\r\n\r\npolicy  states  that MediShield will start  paying  when  the\r\n\r\ntotal claimable medical expenses exceed the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deductibles. Deductibles are currently set at $500 and\r\n\r\n$1,000 for patients in C and B wards respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic restructuring and the recent development\r\n\r\nin medical science, it is timely for the Ministry to consider\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  policy to make MediShield more responsive  to\r\n\r\nthe needs of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\npatients  who  wish to  go to the specialist clinics  at  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  hospitals  must  be referred  by  polyclinics  to\r\n\r\nqualify  as  subsidised patients.  But referrals  by  private\r\n\r\ndoctors do not qualify the patients for subsidy.  So, if they\r\n\r\nhave  to  be admitted to the hospital, they would be sent  to\r\n\r\n\"B1\" or \"A\" class  wards where the medical costs are higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must have some reasons for doing\r\n\r\nthis. But, what are these reasons?  Does it mean that private\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  not  as good as Government doctors  in  judging\r\n\r\nwhether the patients need to consult specialist doctors?   If\r\n\r\nthe  principle for patient subsidy is based on the  patient's\r\n\r\nfinancial needs, then how do you determine that all those who\r\n\r\ngo to polyclinics need the subsidy financially?  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nat  the  polyclinic, the waiting time is normally very  long.\r\n\r\nDo  the  patients  need to suffer the inconvenience  just  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for Government's subsidy?  Can MOH consider allowing\r\n\r\npatients referred by private doctors to qualify for admission\r\n\r\nto the subsidised wards as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the Medical Endowment Fund set\r\n\r\nup  by the Government would help older Singaporeans to defray\r\n\r\nthe  cost of medical treatment after the Government hospitals\r\n\r\nwere  restructured.  Yet, when we talk to the retirees,  many\r\n\r\nof  them  are  fearful  of their ability  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\ntreatment  and  this has been reflected by previous  speakers\r\n\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Tan pointed out, this could be an irrational fear.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that many of these retirees are unaware of the\r\n\r\nexisting  Medifund or whether they are eligible  for  such  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  In this year's Budget, FY2001, another $100 million\r\n\r\nis added to the Medical Endowment Fund, bringing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  total to $800 million.  This is a laudable move  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and demonstrates this Government's care  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   Yet,  Sir, at 4% interest, the  Fund  yielded  $28\r\n\r\nmillion  last  year and would yield another $32 million  this\r\n\r\nyear,  a  mere $4 million increase this year over last  year.\r\n\r\nTo  meet  the needs of the elderly in Singapore,  $4  million\r\n\r\nincrease per year seems a pretty meagre sum to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several questions for the Minister. Firstly, for\r\n\r\nthe   years  since  the  Medical  Endowment  Fund  has   been\r\n\r\nestablished, what has been the utilisation rate of  Medifund?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  whether MOH has a programme to publicise  Medifund\r\n\r\nand help people understand how they could qualify for such  a\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, casemix was\r\n\r\nborn  out of a desire to increase hospital efficiency through\r\n\r\nappropriate  funding and also as a tool for cost  containment\r\n\r\nwhich was the Government's major concern in the context of  a\r\n\r\nrapidly aging society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix is here to stay. However, we must be aware of\r\n\r\nthe  weaknesses and be cautious of extending it  to  Medisave\r\n\r\nbased  claims.   I have spoken to many in the profession  and\r\n\r\nthese are some of the expressed concerns on casemix.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in increasing the efficiency of hospitals, we\r\n\r\nmust  be  mindful  that, given our standard  and  quality  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  our GDP spending must be one of the  lowest,  if\r\n\r\nnot  the  lowest  in  the  world, for  comparable  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices. Even though casemix is overall subvention  neutral,\r\n\r\nit  will  increase  the  impetus  for  doctors  to  discharge\r\n\r\npatients  earlier as hospitals will be penalised if  patients\r\n\r\nstay  longer than the so-called \"appropriate length of stay\".\r\n\r\nI  remember that in all my years of service in a restructured\r\n\r\nhospital, we often had to do an extra discharge round on  top\r\n\r\nof  the routine ward to discharge even more patients so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can create more bed space.  If we push the limits further\r\n\r\nby  putting pressure to further limit the hospital stay,  the\r\n\r\nlosers are the patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix puts pressure on hospitals to reduce high\r\n\r\noutliers, that is, those patients\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have  exceeded  the  perceived  cut-off  point  for   an\r\n\r\nappropriate length of stay.  The reality of medicine is  that\r\n\r\nyou   are  dealing  with  human  beings  who  are  not   only\r\n\r\nbiologically different, but also socially different.  In  the\r\n\r\nNational  Heart  Centre, the percentage of  cases  with  high\r\n\r\noutliers  was  as  high  as  20% and  the  second  and  third\r\n\r\ncommonest DRG had 12% and 13% of outliers respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix has also created new concerns by itself. It has\r\n\r\ncreated a new clinical coding profession and this itself  has\r\n\r\nproduced   new  problems  by  increasing  cost   through   an\r\n\r\nadditional layer of administration and by a shortfall of well-trained  and  experienced coders.  A shortfall of  experience\r\n\r\nand  trained  coders  can affect data  collection  and  hence\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the casemix data.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A central tenet used in our casemix model is flawed.\r\n\r\nThe  definition  of principal diagnosis (PD) currently  being\r\n\r\nused is that of the Australian definition where the principal\r\n\r\ndiagnosis is a diagnosis of condition established after study\r\n\r\nto  be  chiefly  responsible for the patient's  admission  to\r\n\r\nhospital.  Feedback received from hospitals suggest that  the\r\n\r\npresent  definition of PD may not be fair and equitable.  The\r\n\r\nCasemix  Project Office (CPO) has rejected the definition  of\r\n\r\nPD  as a diagnosis that requires the most resources, although\r\n\r\nthey  stated that it was logical as actual costing  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to determine each individual condition  to  compare\r\n\r\nthem  with.   They  considered it too costly  and  too  time-consuming.  This would involve getting real cost data and not\r\n\r\njust  historical data.  It will be time-consuming to get true\r\n\r\ncost  data  and  this will require more years  than  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod we are taking to implement this.  The Australian  took\r\n\r\nyears  to  implement the system but yet we want to do  it  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  short time.  Are we ready or are we using historical\r\n\r\ndata   rather   than  true  cost  data  because   there   are\r\n\r\nimplementation  timelines to meet?  How then  can  equity  of\r\n\r\nsubventions be addressed with a flawed definition?   The  CPO\r\n\r\ntries  to  justify this by saying that the level of resources\r\n\r\nfor patients is not kept to each individual patient, that is,\r\n\r\nno specific cap\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  the  individual level.  No patient should be denied  care\r\n\r\nbecause they cost more than the average patient.  What really\r\n\r\nmatters  is  that  hospitals are  adequately  subvented.   In\r\n\r\ntheory,  this sounds statistically acceptable.   In  reality,\r\n\r\nthere will be pressure on everyone to reduce outliers as this\r\n\r\nis  the  purpose  of casemix, which brings  me  to  the  next\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are saying that the level of resources is not\r\n\r\ncapped to each individual patient, how then can one justify a\r\n\r\nMedisave based system, since Medisave is personal to each and\r\n\r\nevery patient?  The CPO has visited private hospitals and has\r\n\r\nmade  no  bones that they would implement a balanced  billing\r\n\r\nMedisave based casemix system.  There are real concerns about\r\n\r\na  balanced billing system in the private sector.   How  does\r\n\r\nbalanced  billing cater for new treatments as there  will  be\r\n\r\nsignificant time lag for administrative changes? Would  there\r\n\r\nbe  sufficient  flexibility in the proposed system  to  allow\r\n\r\nrapid  adaptation  to increasing costs due to  new  effective\r\n\r\ntreatments  which  are  necessary to maintain  a  world-class\r\n\r\nmedical  support  system?  How do we solve  the  problems  of\r\n\r\noutliers  in  a balanced billing system for patients  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector when the percentage of outliers  is  even  as\r\n\r\nhigh  as 20% in the restructured hospitals?  Casemix may work\r\n\r\nto some extent in the public sector because it is possible to\r\n\r\naverage  out the cost of large numbers of patients.  Outliers\r\n\r\nare,  therefore,  compensated on a statistical  basis.   This\r\n\r\ndoes not work out in the private sector where each individual\r\n\r\nspecialist  has a few patients of a particular  DRG  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber is not anywhere large enough for statistical averaging\r\n\r\nto be meaningful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casemix does not recognise the difference between public\r\n\r\nand  private  medical treatment.  The quality of personalised\r\n\r\ncare  with  time taken, conducted exclusively by consultants,\r\n\r\nis  also  not  acknowledged.  In the  private  sector,  where\r\n\r\nhospitals' and doctors' bills are separate, how would casemix\r\n\r\nbe able to apportion the fees in a fair and equitable manner?\r\n\r\nMany issues remain unresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would end by sharing with the Minister the sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by a prominent doctor after a recent meeting  with\r\n\r\nthe  CPO team. He said, \"The dialogue was a farce.  The  team\r\n\r\ntook  the  view  that casemix in private is a  fact  of  life\r\n\r\nalready  and they are only looking to see how to tweak  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit based on feedback.  This is a mockery of the  S21\r\n\r\nprocess  and openness of Government.  In this case,  even  if\r\n\r\nvery  fundamental  flaws cannot be solved,  casemix  will  be\r\n\r\nrammed  through regardless of consequences.\"  Unlike  him,  I\r\n\r\nhave  better  faith in the Government and the Ministry.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  has always been extremely thorough and has  a  good\r\n\r\ngrasp of issues.  I am not looking for answers today as these\r\n\r\nare  complex issues, but rather to place these real  concerns\r\n\r\nacross.   Casemix  is here to stay but let us  resolve  these\r\n\r\nissues  so  that we can have a good system and not  a  flawed\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We should be getting hungry now and it is\r\n\r\na good time to take the lunch break.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This gives  me\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to reassure Members that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nindeed  committed  to  providing good  and  affordable  basic\r\n\r\nmedical  services  to all Singaporeans.  This  commitment  is\r\n\r\nclearly set out in the 1993 White Paper on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffordable Health Care and we intend to meet this commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I must say that I am very happy with my\r\n\r\nMinistry's budget this year.  It has been increased  by  30%.\r\n\r\nMr Bernard Chen has asked how we intend to use the additional\r\n\r\nfunds.   We  will put the additional money to good  use.   We\r\n\r\nwill  increase  the  budget of our two  healthcare  clusters.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will increase the budget of the primary care\r\n\r\nsector  by  28%,  the acute medical sector  by  14%  and  the\r\n\r\npsychiatric  medical  sector by 26%.  The  additional  budget\r\n\r\nwill  be used to offset increases in manpower cost.  I  think\r\n\r\nseveral  Members raised the importance of paying our  medical\r\n\r\nstaff  appropriately according to market  rates.   The  money\r\n\r\nwill  also be used to strengthen quality assurance programmes\r\n\r\nand to also implement new initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also increase the budget for health\r\n\r\npromotion  activities by a very significant 68%.   The  funds\r\n\r\nwill  be  used  to  strengthen preventive healthcare,  health\r\n\r\npromotion  and  public  education, to prevent  the  onset  of\r\n\r\nchronic  diseases.  This is what Dr Lily Neo  said,  \"setting\r\n\r\nthe foundation to keep future healthcare cost down.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we will also set aside $75 million for\r\n\r\nspecific  national  programmes, such as the  health  services\r\n\r\ndevelopment   programme,  setting  up  the  various   disease\r\n\r\nregistries  and  so  on.   Funds  will  also  be  set   aside\r\n\r\nspecifically   to   train  our  medical  undergraduates   and\r\n\r\nspecialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to healthcare expenditure. Dr Lily Neo\r\n\r\nand  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen have commented about our low level  of\r\n\r\nnational healthcare expenditure (NHE), which is about  3%-odd\r\n\r\nof  our GDP compared to other major developed countries which\r\n\r\ncan  range  from about 7% in UK to 14% in the US.    Dr  Wang\r\n\r\nasked specifically how we can spend so little and yet achieve\r\n\r\nso  much.  I must first say that we cannot claim full  credit\r\n\r\nfor  this  performance.   There are several  factors  in  our\r\n\r\nfavour,  some of which have been pointed out by Dr Wang.   We\r\n\r\nare  an  urbanised  society, compared to many  big  countries\r\n\r\nwhich have a rural sector, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  cost quite a lot more to service.  We have, right  from\r\n\r\nthe  onset, laid a very good foundation in very stringent and\r\n\r\ngood environmental health, and that has, of course, given  us\r\n\r\na  good  starting point, and public healthcare  is  therefore\r\n\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, another key factor is that we have a\r\n\r\nrelatively  young  population,  compared  to  many  of  these\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries.  Our aged population, those aged 65  and\r\n\r\nabove,  constitutes  about  7%.  In  many  of  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  it is closer to 10-12%.  We have a  much  younger\r\n\r\npopulation.  So we can expect that when our population  ages,\r\n\r\nthe     national    health    expenditure    will    increase\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is our strong economic growth in the last\r\n\r\n20  years, which averaged about 8% per annum, compared to our\r\n\r\npopulation growth of less than 2% per annum.  In this way, we\r\n\r\ncould  enjoy significant improvements in our healthcare every\r\n\r\nyear  without the percentage share of GDP going  up  by  very\r\n\r\nmuch.   But  as we move forward, as our economy  matures  and\r\n\r\ngrowth  slows down, we can therefore expect  the  NHE,  as  a\r\n\r\npercentage of GDP, to correspondingly increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important reason is our prudent policies in\r\n\r\nthe provision and financing of healthcare.  This has played a\r\n\r\nsignificant role in containing healthcare cost increases.  If\r\n\r\nwe  lose  this discipline, we can expect healthcare  cost  to\r\n\r\nsoar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, I can say that our national healthcare\r\n\r\ncost  is  low and indeed we should be happy that our national\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost  is low, because this correspondingly  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  average Singaporean household needs  to  pay  only\r\n\r\nabout  3%  of their household expenditure, or about  $93  per\r\n\r\nmonth, on healthcare services.  Based on an average household\r\n\r\nsize of 4.2, each household member therefore spends about $22\r\n\r\nper  month  on healthcare.  To put this in perspective,  this\r\n\r\namount  is  less  than the average amount  that  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean  spends  on  recreation and  entertainment.   So,\r\n\r\nbecause  our national healthcare cost is low, the  burden  on\r\n\r\nindividual household is also low.  Of course, this is looking\r\n\r\nat the macro\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlevel.  When we look at the individual level, we have to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  our  medical financing framework caters  for  the\r\n\r\nfamily  who  has to pay a high bill because of  a  particular\r\n\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members agree that we should not look at how\r\n\r\nmuch  we  spend to evaluate our healthcare system.   When  we\r\n\r\nevaluate  whether  a national healthcare  system  serves  its\r\n\r\ncitizens well, we should not look at the inputs but we should\r\n\r\nlook at what we achieve.   I think there are many parameters,\r\n\r\nwhich I will not go through in detail. I would just say  that\r\n\r\nthese   parameters   are  adopted   by   the   World   Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation.  They did an assessment of all the countries in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   Among 191 countries, they came to a  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  our  healthcare system is ranked 6th  in  overall  cost\r\n\r\neffectiveness.   That means they looked at  our  output,  the\r\n\r\nclinical  outcomes of service, our waiting  times,  sense  of\r\n\r\nequity,  sense of accessibility.  They looked  at  all  these\r\n\r\nfactors and looked at our inputs, and they ranked us 6th.  So\r\n\r\nI think we have done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key macro parameter which Dr Lily Neo and Dr\r\n\r\nWang  pointed  out  is  the  public  share  of  the  national\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure.  They observed that the public  share\r\n\r\nis  about  a  third, compared to other countries  which  will\r\n\r\nrange from probably half for the average to maybe 70-80%  for\r\n\r\ncountries  which  adopt  a national  health  system  kind  of\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look at the healthcare systems around the\r\n\r\nworld,  we probably can put them in a spectrum.  On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  we  have  a  very equitable, open  to  all,  everybody\r\n\r\nenjoying the same type of service, epitomised by the National\r\n\r\nHealth  Service of the UK.  On the other end of the spectrum,\r\n\r\nyou  probably look at the voluntary health insurance  system,\r\n\r\nas practised in the US, and somewhere in between, most of the\r\n\r\nother  systems will fall in.  Most of the developed  European\r\n\r\ncountries  will be closer to the British end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nBecause of that approach, the share of the public sector will\r\n\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the public sector share is one third.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  of  the  way we  organise  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nfinancing.   We  ask  every Singaporean  to  pay  into  their\r\n\r\nMedisave and then they pay the bills from their Medisave.  If\r\n\r\nyou  can  imagine that instead of contributing  6%  into  the\r\n\r\nMedisave account we ask them to pay 3% of their salaries into\r\n\r\na  national insurance system,  as a medical payroll tax,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is then used to fund the system, you will see the share\r\n\r\nof  the  public sector going up.  So I do not think we should\r\n\r\nread  too  much into this sharing of the national  healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure between the public sector and the private sector.\r\n\r\nIt  is how you organise the medical financing framework.   It\r\n\r\nis more important to look at the output.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding what I said about our low national\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure, I do not think we are complacent.  We\r\n\r\nknow that the pressure on healthcare cost is relentless,  and\r\n\r\nmany  Members  have  spoken  about  this.   The  increase  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost is a world-wide phenomenon.  Singapore cannot\r\n\r\nbe  insulated  from  the trends and developments  around  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Medical technology continues to advance and we expect\r\n\r\nnew  developments in diagnostics, biomedical devices and drug\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  In the US, for example, drug prices have  risen\r\n\r\nby  as  much as 15% a year.  Also, as our standard of  living\r\n\r\nimproves, Singaporeans will have higher expectations.  Demand\r\n\r\nfor  healthcare services will correspondingly  increase.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  we are undergoing a major structural  change  in\r\n\r\nour  demography.   So  we  are under tremendous  pressure  on\r\n\r\nhealthcare  cost.  The challenge for us is  how  do  we  keep\r\n\r\nabreast of this challenge so that to the average Singaporean,\r\n\r\nhealthcare continues to remain affordable.  Mr Bernard Chen's\r\n\r\ncomments  on health cost is spot-on, 60% of our  cost  is  in\r\n\r\nmanpower,  15%  of  our  cost is  in  medical  supplies,  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  which  is  imported and therefore  out  of  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  So the cost pressure is there.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so far, we have done reasonably well. We have been\r\n\r\nable to contain the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease in healthcare cost to within the range of 6%  to  8%\r\n\r\nper year.  Looking forward, we cannot keep still.  We have to\r\n\r\nadjust  and  refine our financing framework so  that  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enjoy sensible improvements in  our  healthcare\r\n\r\nservice,   while   still  keeping  it   affordable   to   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the whole framework of financing - we\r\n\r\ncall   this  the  3M  framework  (Medisave,  MediShield   and\r\n\r\nMedifund) - and how the 3M framework has allowed Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto be able to pay for their medical bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Medisave. I agree with Members that there is a\r\n\r\ngeneral  perception  that  the  use  of  Medisave  is  rather\r\n\r\nrestrictive.   There are many suggestions to extend  Medisave\r\n\r\nto  outpatient  treatments.  While  the  original  intent  of\r\n\r\nMedisave  is  to  help Singaporeans cope with hospitalisation\r\n\r\nexpenses,  we all agree that the trend is towards  ambulatory\r\n\r\ncare.   Medisave is already allowed for day surgery and  over\r\n\r\ntime,  we  will extend Medisave to more outpatient treatments\r\n\r\nwhere  appropriate.  However, I must say that we must proceed\r\n\r\ncautiously  because an overly liberal use of  Medisave  would\r\n\r\nnecessitate higher monthly contribution rates.  So we need to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will be making adjustments to the Medisave\r\n\r\nwithdrawal limits so that most Class B2 and C patients  would\r\n\r\nbe  able to pay their hospitalisation bills through Medisave.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also  increase the Medisave withdrawal  limits  for\r\n\r\ncertain  expensive outpatient treatment, such as chemotherapy\r\n\r\nand renal dialysis, to help alleviate the financial burden on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Details of these adjustments will be announced\r\n\r\nsoon.  But I would just want to dampen expectations.  We know\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  make  the  change, but we  will  have  to  move\r\n\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MediShield. My Ministry is also looking at\r\n\r\nrelying  more  on  medical insurance  to  complement  medical\r\n\r\nsavings  to  improve  the efficiency of  the  entire  patient\r\n\r\nfinance  structure.  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has  pointed  out  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  low  payouts  of  MediShield.   My  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ncurrently reviewing MediShield with a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview  towards  enhancing  its  features,  in  particular  the\r\n\r\nclaimable  amounts.  We are also looking at the  deductibles.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure that MediShield is able to provide adequate\r\n\r\nprotection  to the elderly and other Singaporeans  who  incur\r\n\r\nhigh  medical bill sizes.  Again, we need to strike a balance\r\n\r\nbetween  enhancing the features of MediShield whilst  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  keeping  MediShield premiums  affordable  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third \"M\" in our 3M structure is Medifund. Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen  asked  about the utilisation of Medifund  interest\r\n\r\nincome.   The average utilisation is about 77%, and  this  is\r\n\r\ndespite  the approval rate for Medifund which is consistently\r\n\r\nbeing  above 97%.  97% of applications that come  to  us  are\r\n\r\nroutinely  approved, and even then we only  use  77%  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds  available.   So  I want to assure  Members  here  that\r\n\r\nMedifund is more than adequate to meet the needs of the  low-income  Singaporeans.  In fact, it is a very effective safety\r\n\r\nnet.   As  we  all  know, Dr Richard Hu  announced  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  inject  a further  $100  million  into  the\r\n\r\ncapital  sum  of  Medifund, bringing it to a  total  of  $800\r\n\r\nmillion.   I  agree  that  we should  publicise  the  use  of\r\n\r\nMedifund  more deliberately so that people who face financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties will seek recourse to Medifund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that we have medical social\r\n\r\nworkers  in  all  our hospitals.  Whenever they  come  across\r\n\r\ncases  of patients facing financial problems, they will  take\r\n\r\nup  the  cases  and  apply  for Medifund  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npatients.   I  do  not think we will find  very  many  people\r\n\r\nfalling through the Medifund safety net.  As I have said many\r\n\r\ntimes  here in this House, if any Member comes across genuine\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases that require Medifund assistance, feel  free\r\n\r\nto  write to either my Parliamentary Secretary or myself, and\r\n\r\nwe  will  take up the cases.  But from my experience  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  years, the Ministry has shown that the Medifund  safety\r\n\r\nnet is a very effective safety net.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the 3M framework has served us well. I\r\n\r\nthink what we need are refinements and adjustments.  What  is\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntarget?  Our target is that all Singaporeans who make regular\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  their  Medisave and  who  are  covered  by\r\n\r\nMediShield would not need to pay out of pocket, if they  stay\r\n\r\nin  a B2 or C ward.  If their Medisave accounts run out, they\r\n\r\ncan  apply to Medifund to help pay for their bills.  So  that\r\n\r\nis our target, and by and large we have achieved that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must caution that Singaporeans who choose to go\r\n\r\nfor  higher  ward  classes  or who  wish  to  go  to  private\r\n\r\nhospitals  would  have to pay out of  their  pocket.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore    important   that   Singaporeans   who    require\r\n\r\nhospitalisation choose their ward class prudently.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhy  financial counselling is a mandatory requirement in  all\r\n\r\nhospitals, both in the public and private hospitals.  This is\r\n\r\na  requirement  before they are allowed to use  Medisave  for\r\n\r\ntheir patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua when she spoke about the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  financial  counselling  which  would   enable\r\n\r\npatients   to   have  a  better  estimate  of  the   expected\r\n\r\nhospitalisation charges so that they can choose the  type  of\r\n\r\nward  class according to their means.  I think Dr  Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock also made several very timely and wise remarks about the\r\n\r\nrole  that doctors play in helping to keep health cost  down.\r\n\r\nI think it is worth reiteration, and these remarks would have\r\n\r\nto be more widely transmitted to the professional community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture try and respond to some of the\r\n\r\nother points raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.  We have some rules\r\n\r\nin the way the subsidies are given.  If a patient opts for  a\r\n\r\nB1  or  A class ward, he or she can ask for a downgrade,  and\r\n\r\nmost  times this would be acceded.  The only exception is  if\r\n\r\nyou  go  to  a  private hospital and then later you  want  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  to  a  public  hospital, we will  insist  that  you\r\n\r\ntransfer to a B1, that means, a non-subsidised ward.  But  if\r\n\r\nyou  are within the public hospital system, if you ask for  a\r\n\r\ndowngrade, this would be considered with one condition  -  we\r\n\r\nwill ask that you go for means testing.  So if you enter the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealth system and at the point of entry you choose B2  or  C,\r\n\r\nno  questions are asked, we would let you have the subsidies.\r\n\r\nBut  if you opt to be non-subsidised and later on you ask  to\r\n\r\nbe subsidised, then we insist that you go for a means test so\r\n\r\nthat  we know that the subsidy is correctly targeted  at  the\r\n\r\nlow  income  families.  So that is the  only  rule.   If  you\r\n\r\ncannot afford to pay the fees, you can ask the medical social\r\n\r\nworkers  in the hospitals and they will undertake  to  review\r\n\r\nyour  case.  And the hospitals have some means to  waive  the\r\n\r\nfees, if the case is genuine, or to seek Medifund assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan also asked that we prescribe shorter duration for\r\n\r\ndrugs  rather than giving out one to two months'  supply.   I\r\n\r\nthink we would have to depend on the doctors to exercise  the\r\n\r\njudgement.  In some cases, it is more sensible to give one to\r\n\r\ntwo  months' supply so as to make it more convenient, and the\r\n\r\npatients do not have to come back so often.  At other  times,\r\n\r\nit  may be sensible, as he suggests, to just give one or  two\r\n\r\nweeks' supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this whole issue of Government subsidies, again,\r\n\r\nlet  me  stress  that  the Government basically  assures  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that they will have access to affordable  basic\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   The  same package of basic medical  service  is\r\n\r\navailable  to all classes of wards.  The key differences  are\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  unsubsidised wards, you enjoy the ambience  of\r\n\r\nfewer  patients  to  a  room  and  you  can  name  your   own\r\n\r\nconsultants.  But other than that, between a B2 and a A ward,\r\n\r\nthe Government will extend the same basic level of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also remarked about the high level of\r\n\r\nsubventions to the hospitals.  As you well know, the  highest\r\n\r\nshare  of  medical  expenses  occurs  in  our  hospitals  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  this results in a higher proportion of subvention.\r\n\r\nGovernment  subvention  to the restructured  polyclinics  and\r\n\r\nhospitals  has therefore increased significantly every  year.\r\n\r\nIn FY1999, it was $580 million.  In FY2000, it was revised to\r\n\r\n$700 million and this year, we will increase it to just about\r\n\r\n$1 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government is prepared to increase the\r\n\r\nsubventions, we must make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure  that we target the subventions appropriately.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  both  Mr  Low  Thia Khiang and Mrs Lim  Hwee  Hua  that\r\n\r\nsubsidies should be directed at those who are most deserving.\r\n\r\nThe  most  direct way to channel the subsidies to the  lower-income  group,  which may eventually be necessary,  would  be\r\n\r\nthrough some form of means testing.  However, as pointed  out\r\n\r\nin  the  1993  White  Paper on Affordable  Healthcare,  means\r\n\r\ntesting  is  an administratively clumsy procedure  which  the\r\n\r\npublic will take some time to get used to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current rules allow you to enjoy subsidies if you go\r\n\r\nthrough  the polyclinic system and then you go to the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals.   We  keep  these rules.  But  if  you  enter  the\r\n\r\nhospital  through the private GP, at the point of entry  into\r\n\r\nthe hospital, whether or not you are in the A&E ward, you can\r\n\r\nchoose the ward that you want to go to, whether it is  B2  or\r\n\r\nC.   If you choose B2 or C, then obviously you will enjoy the\r\n\r\n65%  subsidy  and  80% subsidy accordingly.   The  choice  is\r\n\r\navailable  at the point when you are admitted.   If  you  are\r\n\r\nreferred to the Specialists' Outpatient Clinic by the private\r\n\r\nsector GP, then as a starting point, we will treat you  as  a\r\n\r\nprivate  patient.   If you are referred to  the  Specialists'\r\n\r\nOutpatient Clinic by the polyclinic, we will treat you  as  a\r\n\r\nsubsidised patient.  But if you cannot afford to pay the fees\r\n\r\nin  the  Specialists' Outpatient Clinic, you can  ask  to  be\r\n\r\nreclassified and we will require you to be means tested.   So\r\n\r\nit is a win-win situation for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody who wants to enjoy subsidised healthcare can go\r\n\r\nto  a polyclinic and then go to the SOC, and no questions are\r\n\r\nasked,  we would not require you to be means tested, and  you\r\n\r\ncan  enjoy  subsidised  fees.  But if you  enter  the  public\r\n\r\nhealthcare  system through the private GP and you think  that\r\n\r\nyou deserve subsidised healthcare because you are from a low-income  family, then you ask to be means tested.  And if  you\r\n\r\ndo  qualify, then you will enjoy the subsidy.  So that  is  a\r\n\r\nfair system.  It may not be completely effective, because  as\r\n\r\nMr  Low Thia Khiang suggested, you will allow rich people  to\r\n\r\nenjoy subsidies by going through the polyclinic system.  So I\r\n\r\nhope Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKhiang will continue to plug the line and when the population\r\n\r\nis  ready to accept means testing, we will use means  testing\r\n\r\nin a wider way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim raised some concerns about casemix. I do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to go through the details because this is  a  very\r\n\r\nspecific issue.  All I want to say is that we would take  his\r\n\r\ncomments  and review them.  I want to assure the  House  that\r\n\r\ncasemix is intended to be a more effective and efficient  way\r\n\r\nto  allocate resources.  It is not intended to cause  doctors\r\n\r\nto  discharge  patients earlier.  The  casemix  provides  for\r\n\r\noutlier  cases, as Dr Michael Lim raised, that  means  people\r\n\r\nwho  need to stay longer than what is provided for in casemix\r\n\r\nsubvention.  We allow the outliers to continue to stay in the\r\n\r\nhospitals  if the doctors deem it necessary and we will  then\r\n\r\nsubsidise  those  outlier patients on a per  day  basis.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is  no change in the way we continue to subvent  these\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that casemix will not result in\r\n\r\ndoctors  coming  under pressure to discharge  their  patients\r\n\r\nprematurely.  Casemix is still in its initial phase.  We need\r\n\r\nto  build up confidence and I am sure people would have  more\r\n\r\nconfidence in the system as we implement it.  As we  get  the\r\n\r\ncosting data sorted out, people will feel that the costing is\r\n\r\nmore  reflective  of the real cost, and the  system  is  more\r\n\r\nequitable.  So we are not rushing the system.  We are  making\r\n\r\nsure  that the system is well implemented, the cost  data  is\r\n\r\nwell  researched.  So far, of course, we have seen  that  our\r\n\r\nlocal cost data, when we compare it with the Australian  cost\r\n\r\ndata,  is very close.  So there is no reason to believe  that\r\n\r\nwe are costing our system wrongly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have an ongoing process where we review the\r\n\r\ncosting methodology with the hospitals.  We will look at  the\r\n\r\nsubvention rates every year to take into account the changing\r\n\r\npattern  of resource utilisation.  So I just want  to  assure\r\n\r\nMembers here that, before casemix is fully enforced, we  have\r\n\r\nthe safeguards in place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand we will make sure that it will be implemented properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua raised some very fundamental questions\r\n\r\nabout  the role and philosophy of our restructured hospitals.\r\n\r\nLet  me just say that we cannot just deal with the increasing\r\n\r\nhealthcare   costs  by  simply  increasing   the   Government\r\n\r\nsubventions  every year.  If we have to, I am  confident  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance would provide the additional budget,  as\r\n\r\nhe  has  done this year with his 30% increase.  But,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, for all of us in the healthcare sector, we have to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  more  efficient, more productive  and  more\r\n\r\nresponsive to the patient's needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key strategy in containing healthcare costs and yet\r\n\r\nproviding  quality healthcare has been the  restructuring  of\r\n\r\nthe  private  healthcare  delivery system.   Since  the  late\r\n\r\n1980s, we have been restructuring our public hospitals one at\r\n\r\na  time,  starting with the Singapore General  Hospital.   By\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year,  we  have  successfully  completed   the\r\n\r\nrestructuring exercise, with the restructuring  of  Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital, Woodbridge Hospital and the polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that some Singaporeans are concerned that\r\n\r\nrestructuring  of  public  sector hospitals  and  polyclinics\r\n\r\ncould  lead  to  higher  charges  because  they  are  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  out  to make a profit.  I would like  to  reaffirm\r\n\r\nthat making profits has never been the main objective of  our\r\n\r\nrestructuring  exercise.  We restructure so that  we  can  be\r\n\r\nmore efficient, more productive and more responsive.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  we  bring the costs down and offer a better service  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make our position on this explicit.\r\n\r\nSingHealth and NHG would therefore be repositioned as not-for-profit  entities.   As  not-for-profit entities,  their  main\r\n\r\nobjective is not to maximise profits, neither are they  under\r\n\r\npressure   to  pay  dividends  to  their  shareholders.    To\r\n\r\nunderscore  this  \"not-for-profit status\", the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  agreed to exempt the two clusters  from  paying\r\n\r\ncorporate tax.  Instead, the tax savings and any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurpluses  generated  as a result of their  efficiency  gains\r\n\r\nwill  be  ploughed  back for medical research,  training  and\r\n\r\npatient care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the concept of not-for-profit is relatively new in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is well established in the US. In the US,  some\r\n\r\nof  the  very  well-known medical centres, such as  the  Mayo\r\n\r\nClinic Foundation in Minnesota and Johns Hopkins Medicine  in\r\n\r\nMaryland  are  operated as not-for-profit organisations.   By\r\n\r\nmodelling  themselves  as not-for-profit  organisations,  our\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals will have a different  organisational\r\n\r\nculture   from   the  private  hospitals.   Our  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  will  continue to preserve their sense  of  public\r\n\r\nservice.   Let me clarify that not-for-profit does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  our  restructured hospitals do not have to worry  about\r\n\r\ncosts.   The not-for-profit organisation must still  exercise\r\n\r\nfinancial  prudence, cost their services accurately,  control\r\n\r\ntheir costs and improve productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the difference, you may ask? For the private\r\n\r\npatients in Class A wards, they will continue to pay for  the\r\n\r\nfull  costs  for the healthcare services they  receive.   The\r\n\r\ndifference is that the profit is not taxed and the profit  is\r\n\r\nnot   meant  for  disbursement  to  the  shareholders.    For\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patients,  they will continue  to  enjoy  a  high\r\n\r\nquality  of  medical care that is heavily subsidised  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  difference is that the hospitals  will  be\r\n\r\nmore efficient and more service-oriented than if it is run as\r\n\r\na Government department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the staff, they will continue to be part of a\r\n\r\ndynamic medical institution with high standards and a  strong\r\n\r\nreputation.   The  difference is that any surplus  they  make\r\n\r\nwill  be  channelled back for medical research, training  and\r\n\r\npatient  care,  ultimately, for the benefit of  the  patients\r\n\r\nthey   serve.    This   would  therefore  differentiate   our\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals from the other private hospitals  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  continue  to  enjoy  a  good   affordable\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I would say that the 3M structure has\r\n\r\ngiven Singaporeans a good affordable healthcare.  We need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make  improvements  primarily  to  extend   the\r\n\r\nMedisave  withdrawal limits so that Singaporeans do not  have\r\n\r\nto  pay out-of-pocket expenses.  We need to extend MediShield\r\n\r\nand medical insurance so that the risk is better pooled among\r\n\r\nthe population.  And we need to implement casemix sensibly so\r\n\r\nthat we can achieve better allocation of our resources.   And\r\n\r\nby   repositioning   our  two  clusters   as   not-for-profit\r\n\r\norganisations, we want to reaffirm the importance  of  public\r\n\r\nservice  in  the organisational structure of our restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.  Sir, like the demographic\r\n\r\nchanges  to Singapore, some of us here are elderly, including\r\n\r\nmyself.   Others  are going to be elderly and  some,  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse, will become one.  So there is no escape from this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Minister in fact is going to\r\n\r\nreposition  the hospitals to be not-for-profit organisations.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed enlightening.  And I hope that the hospitals\r\n\r\nwill  be more patient-centred and be able to render more help\r\n\r\nand more support for the growing elderly population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, healthcare cost for the elderly is and will be an\r\n\r\nincreasing  burden  to families.  All families  with  elderly\r\n\r\nmembers  are likely to be affected, most of all,  those  with\r\n\r\nelderly    who   are   chronically   ill.    Sir,   prolonged\r\n\r\nhospitalisation of these elderly is costly.  And as you know,\r\n\r\nthey  are  likely to remain in hospital for a long  time  and\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  difficulties  to  discharge  them.   It   is\r\n\r\nobviously not a cost effective solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, admission to private nursing home is also not\r\n\r\naffordable, particularly to the lower middle income  families\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not have the funding to be able  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nMany  do  not  qualify to get into the nursing homes  run  by\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations.  Care in community hospitals\r\n\r\nis equally costly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are indeed a few issues for healthcare of the\r\n\r\nelderly that we need to urgently review.  First, the referral\r\n\r\nsystem by general medical practitioners.  For\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical care of the frail and the elderly, we need to relook\r\n\r\nat  the issue because many frail elderly are unable to get to\r\n\r\nthe  polyclinic.   As  they  are quite  familiar  with  their\r\n\r\ngeneral  practitioner, therefore, their first line of defence\r\n\r\nis  to  go  to see their private medical practitioners.   And\r\n\r\nreferrals  of these to specialist care and others  land  them\r\n\r\nwith  having  to be in B1 class ward or A class  ward.   This\r\n\r\ncosts quite a lot for many of them, particularly, those  with\r\n\r\nchronic ill health conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the adequacy of step-down healthcare\r\n\r\nprovisions.  I would like to find out what active  plans  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be implemented to help the chronically ill  elderly\r\n\r\nas  quickly as possible.  The third area is the more flexible\r\n\r\nusage  of Medisave funds, particularly for those with chronic\r\n\r\nillness because it is going to be a long-term healthcare cost\r\n\r\nfor them.  There is a need to review this as that would in  a\r\n\r\nway reduce the burden for healthcare cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there is a need to revise the current\r\n\r\nincome criterion of $2,000 and below for subsidy because many\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  within this sandwiched group.   Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  quite  difficult  for these  families  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost if any of its members are chronically ill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Although the Minister\r\n\r\nhas given the assurance that everyone in Singapore can afford\r\n\r\nthe  medical charges, I feel that I still need to reflect  to\r\n\r\nhim  the worries of the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That medical fees are expensive is a fact. That is\r\n\r\nbecause of the high treatment costs.  Nowadays, many  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly patients prefer to see the specialists, such  as  the\r\n\r\ncardiologist,  the neurologist, the dental  specialist,  etc,\r\n\r\ninstead  of the general practitioners.  Of course,  the  fees\r\n\r\ncharged by the specialists  are higher than those charged  by\r\n\r\nthe general practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are other reasons why people are worried\r\n\r\nabout the high medical expenses.  First, because they are not\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the 3M healthcare framework that incorporates\r\n\r\nthe  characteristics of  personal saving,  medical  insurance\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  assistance,  as  mentioned  by  the  Minister   - Medisave,  MediShield and Medifund.  The majority  of  people\r\n\r\nknow  only  Medisave.  In fact, until today, many people  are\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of the existence of Medifund.  They thought  that\r\n\r\nonce  they are hospitalised and if they cannot pay  the  high\r\n\r\nmedical bills, that will be the end of the road for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many people are still not fully aware of the\r\n\r\ndifferences  between  the  subsidised  wards  and  the   non-subsidised wards.  They only know that the higher  wards  are\r\n\r\nmore  expensive.  It is only when they receive the bills that\r\n\r\nthey have a shock of their life, \"Wow, so expensive!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are real cases where people could not\r\n\r\nafford  the medical bills.  But there has not been a case  of\r\n\r\nanyone  being  driven to the wall.  In my constituency,  from\r\n\r\n1997  to  2000, there was a total of 54 people who could  not\r\n\r\nafford  the  medical  bills, and  received  assistance.   The\r\n\r\namount owing totalled about $200,000.  Medifund paid for  the\r\n\r\n$200,000 medical bills.  There was one patient whose  medical\r\n\r\nbill  was  more than $10,000 per year.  Over four years,  his\r\n\r\nhospital  bills from Tan Tock Seng Hospital totalled $52,000.\r\n\r\nHe  had no money to pay any of these bills.  All these  bills\r\n\r\nwere settled by Medifund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say, \"You can die, but you cannot be sick.\". As\r\n\r\na  Member  of  the  GPC for Health, I would  say  this  is  a\r\n\r\nridiculous  statement.  I would not say that our   healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem  is  perfect.  In fact, I think the greatest challenge\r\n\r\nfor  the Ministry of Health is how to eliminate the worry  of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly  people  on this problem of  escalating  medical\r\n\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should have some system in place to enlighten\r\n\r\nthe  elderly people of all the types of assistance available.\r\n\r\nWe  should  let these people know more about our Government's\r\n\r\n3M  healthcare framework.  For those who do not have Medisave\r\n\r\nor  have  no  income, particularly the older Singaporeans,  I\r\n\r\nthink we should give them more care and more concessions.  In\r\n\r\nfact, most of the older\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have no Medisave and not much income.  We should\r\n\r\ngive  them more practical assistance.  For those who have  no\r\n\r\nincome,  I  think  we should give them better  discounts  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  should  consider raising  the  age  ceiling  for\r\n\r\nMediShield coverage in line with our aging population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the downgrading of the wards, we should be\r\n\r\nmore  flexible.  Some people who opted for the  higher  class\r\n\r\nwards  may not know that at the end of their stay,  the  bill\r\n\r\nwould  be  an  astronomical figure.  Therefore, I  think,  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  more  counselling to the  patients  upon  their\r\n\r\nadmission, so that they know what to expect and how much they\r\n\r\nwould have to pay for their hospitalisation charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should also check to see whether there is\r\n\r\nany  way we could help them to settle this problem.   At  the\r\n\r\npoint of admission, the patient could  afford to stay in  the\r\n\r\nward  class of his choice, but something has happened in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  resulting  in  his  inability  to  pay  the  bills\r\n\r\nsubsequently.  For example, if he suddenly becomes unemployed\r\n\r\nor   his   income   is   substantially   reduced.   In   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  hospital  should  be  more  flexible  in\r\n\r\ndealing with his application for downgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case where a patient was a former nurse.\r\n\r\nAbout  10  years  ago, she had some heart problem.   At  that\r\n\r\ntime, she had an income and because of special treatment as a\r\n\r\nhospital staff, she was admitted to class A ward.  Some years\r\n\r\nlater, she stopped work and hence had  no income.  She  asked\r\n\r\nthe  hospital for downgrading to a lower ward, but it was not\r\n\r\napproved.   So  every time when she went back for  treatment,\r\n\r\nshe had to pay class A charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister said perhaps we could have a means\r\n\r\ntest   to   see  whether  this  patient  could  qualify   for\r\n\r\ndowngrading.  I think we should make known to the public  the\r\n\r\ndetails of this means test.  Perhaps the Minister could  give\r\n\r\nus more details as to how the Government is going to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the elderly people in Singapore, whether there  is\r\n\r\nsome master\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplan to help these elderly to pay for their medical expenses.\r\n\r\nI  think this will help to alleviate their worries about  the\r\n\r\nescalating medical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, there is little doubt that one of the\r\n\r\nbiggest  challenges  for the Ministry of  Health  now  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that healthcare for the elderly will be efficient  and\r\n\r\naffordable  in  the years ahead.  We should be  proactive  in\r\n\r\nplanning  and  we  must  start  laying  the  foundations  for\r\n\r\neldercare with urgency to ensure success in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a favourable outcome in this aspect will make the\r\n\r\ninevitable escalation of healthcare costs a lesser burden for\r\n\r\nthe  people  and the Government.  It will also  make  life  a\r\n\r\nhappier  and  healthier one for our elderly  population.   We\r\n\r\nmust  be especially painstaking at putting in place a  scheme\r\n\r\nto  cope  with the very old, those aged 75 and above.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be an almost three-fold increase of this group that  is\r\n\r\nmost  likely to depend heavily on our healthcare  and  social\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-stop diagnosis and care-plan centre is essential.\r\n\r\nAt this centre, a standardised and holistic assessment can be\r\n\r\ndone  according to the patient's needs.  Having  the  correct\r\n\r\ndiagnosis  and the choicest management for each illness  will\r\n\r\nnot  only result in a better outcome but also save us  money.\r\n\r\nReferral  to the correct doctor and discipline for  treatment\r\n\r\nare  essential for a reduction in hospital admissions.  There\r\n\r\nmust be help to promote independence by supporting people  to\r\n\r\nachieve  their  best  potential and strengthen  families  and\r\n\r\ncommunities    by    supporting    family    and    community\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   To do this, we have to start  training  for\r\n\r\nmore   medical   personnel.   They   include   geriatricians,\r\n\r\nphysiotherapists, community nurses and home-care  nurses  and\r\n\r\ncare-givers.  New courses need to be conducted to  teach  the\r\n\r\nvarious  types  of care, especially community healthcare.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  MOH  should not hesitate in organising a team  to  look\r\n\r\ninto establishing such a centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for MOH on the care of the elderly will be\r\n\r\nin assisting them to live\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  independently and for as long as possible  in  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes, with appropriate support.  Sir, the aim is to maximise\r\n\r\nindependent  living and social functioning, and  to  minimise\r\n\r\navoidable  hospital  admissions and  premature  or  avoidable\r\n\r\ndependence  on  long-term  care  in  institutional  settings.\r\n\r\nThere should be appropriate support services to help maintain\r\n\r\nthe  frail  elderly in the community for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nHome-care  with  domiciliary  services,  and  day-care   with\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  facilities as well  as  occupational  therapy\r\n\r\nservices with the equipment and adaptations at homes,  should\r\n\r\nbe  made  readily available.  It is also necessary to  garner\r\n\r\nample community help and community volunteers to deliver  the\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive care should remain the hallmark of eldercare.\r\n\r\nMOH   should  facilitate  further  in  this  area  with  more\r\n\r\ncampaigns  through  the doctors and healthcare  workers,  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots, VWOs and the media, to encourage Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ngo  for  early health-checks and treatment.  MOH must provide\r\n\r\nearly  treatment for the sick elderly.  An important  message\r\n\r\nfor  this target group will be \"disabilities in old  age  are\r\n\r\noften due to disease, and early treatment of the disease  can\r\n\r\nprevent disabilities\".  Upon this basis, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nMOH  to ensure that those with chronic diseases can get their\r\n\r\nregular long-term medications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a preventive care scheme is not provided for\r\n\r\nthose  elderly  who are well, illnesses causing  disabilities\r\n\r\nwill occur more frequently.  This will, in turn, lead to more\r\n\r\nhospitalisations  and higher costs.  If  the  community-based\r\n\r\nservices  are inadequate, more re-admissions to hospitals  or\r\n\r\ninstitutional-care centres will again lead to  higher  costs.\r\n\r\nI hope, therefore, that the Ministry of Health will look into\r\n\r\nthese issues soonest possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nfirst of all thank the Minister for Health, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,\r\n\r\nfor  accepting my proposal of providing health checks for the\r\n\r\nelderly  people.  The comprehensive health check for all  the\r\n\r\nelderly above the age of 55 has gained good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  from the people and they really appreciate  it.   In\r\n\r\nthe long-term, this kind of health-check will help to prepare\r\n\r\nthem for preventive health care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good plan. Unfortunately, there are some snags\r\n\r\nin  the implementation of this health-check exercise. Some of\r\n\r\nthe elderly people who have registered, failed to turn up for\r\n\r\nthe  health-check at the appointed time.  I  have  done  some\r\n\r\nhouse-to-house visits to find out the reason why they  failed\r\n\r\nto  turn up for the health-check.  Some of them told me  that\r\n\r\nthey were afraid that the health check would reveal something\r\n\r\nwrong with their health and they would have to take drugs for\r\n\r\na  long  time,  and  taking drugs for a  long  time  is  very\r\n\r\nexpensive.  So they simply bury their heads in the  sand  and\r\n\r\npretend  that there is nothing wrong with them. This  is  the\r\n\r\nway they try to run away from reality. We must find some ways\r\n\r\nto relieve them of this psychological burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Health seriously\r\n\r\nconsider that some  discount of, say, 30% to 50%, be given to\r\n\r\nthe  senior citizens, particularly the retirees,   when  they\r\n\r\npurchase  their  medicine  from the  Government  polyclinics.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the health checks should be extended to those  aged\r\n\r\n50  and above, instead of the minimum age of 55.  This  would\r\n\r\nenable  people  who  are  above 50 years  old  to  start  the\r\n\r\npractice of preventive medical care earlier, and ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey would live a longer and healthier life after retirement.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will consider these two points.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>2.08 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  the Government has done well  in  providing\r\n\r\nhealthcare  for  the  elderly.  Recently,  we  announced  the\r\n\r\nsubsidized  health  screening for  the  elderly  costing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  $6.6 million and also a provision of $11  million\r\n\r\nbasic MediShield plan for the elderly.  All these schemes are\r\n\r\nintended to ensure that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour elderly are well taken care of in the event they have  to\r\n\r\nbe hospitalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am concerned over the recent increase in\r\n\r\ncharges  for  specialist treatment in  hospitals.   Will  the\r\n\r\nincrease in charges make it more difficult for the elderly to\r\n\r\nseek  treatment?  Even if their children are willing to  pay,\r\n\r\nit  would cause undue financial burden to them, especially if\r\n\r\nthey come from lower-income families.  This is especially  so\r\n\r\nwhen  the elderly are more prone to illness due to their  old\r\n\r\nage.   As a result, they may require more extensive and long-term treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polyclinics have done well by providing affordable\r\n\r\noutpatient   treatment  and  by  giving  the   elderly   sick\r\n\r\nconcessionary rates.  However, in hospitalisation cases,  the\r\n\r\nMediShield plan should be able to take care of the main  bulk\r\n\r\nof  the  cost,  while, in certain extremely difficult  cases,\r\n\r\nMedifund will chip in to help.  My main concern is how we can\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  in  the  event the  elderly  patients  need\r\n\r\nspecialist  consultation at the hospital after referral  from\r\n\r\nthe  polyclinic, they will not stop seeking treatment due  to\r\n\r\nthe  high  cost  of such treatment. If they do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nburden  their children, they will cite reasons such  as  high\r\n\r\ncost or others, and ask for traditional and cheaper types  of\r\n\r\ntreatment.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nimposing  a  cap on the amount that could be  charged.   When\r\n\r\nthey  seek specialist treatment, the amount should be a token\r\n\r\nsum  as  a  gesture of goodwill in recognition of their  past\r\n\r\ncontributions to the society during their younger  days.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  they will know that their charges are capped  and\r\n\r\nthey  would not have to worry whether they have the financial\r\n\r\nresources to pay for continual treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We welcome the\r\n\r\nMinister's  announcement  that  the  restructured  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals  will not be profit-orientated and that  they  will\r\n\r\nserve  the  people, irrespective of their affordability.   We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  we  are  facing  the  problem  of  an  aging\r\n\r\npopulation.  With an aging population, the number of  elderly\r\n\r\nadmitted  into nursing homes will also increase.  At present,\r\n\r\nmost of the nursing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhomes are run by VWOs, with subsidies from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government provided a piece of land for\r\n\r\nbuilding a nursing home with a lease of 30 years only.   This\r\n\r\nwas  open  for  the private sector to tender and  the  tender\r\n\r\nprice  was  close to $7 million.  With 30 years' lease,  plus\r\n\r\nconstruction costs, investment in infrastructure,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  how  much the nursing home will charge the patients  in\r\n\r\norder to recoup its capital and make some profit.  Given  the\r\n\r\nhigh  costs of setting up nursing homes and the need for  the\r\n\r\noperators  to  make some profits on top of  the  recovery  of\r\n\r\ntheir  cost, it is inevitable that the burden on the patients\r\n\r\nwill  increase  if  they  are admitted  into  nursing  homes.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  reports,  the  Government  will,  in   stages,\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  allot 13 to 17 pieces of land for tender.   The\r\n\r\nplots  of  land will be conveniently located in  HDB  housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the change in policy mean that there will be a\r\n\r\nchange  in the Government's attitude towards the care of  the\r\n\r\nelderly?   The  report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee  on\r\n\r\nthe  Aeging Population states that every Singaporean must  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  his  health when  he  gets  old,  including\r\n\r\nfinancial  planning  for  his old age  needs.   I  have  some\r\n\r\nquestions.   What would be the Government's attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthe  elderly who need medical care but who do not have  their\r\n\r\nown  resources  to  pay for such care?   Secondly,  will  MOH\r\n\r\ncontinue to allocate land to encourage VWOs to build  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  and,  at  the same time, provide them with  subsidies?\r\n\r\nThirdly,  what  is MOH's long-term plan for the establishment\r\n\r\nof  nursing  homes?  What will be the ratio  between  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  run by VWOs and those run commercially by the  private\r\n\r\nsector?\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it has been a\r\n\r\nlittle  over  a year since the Ministry of Health  introduced\r\n\r\nrevised  funding principles for nursing homes, in  which  the\r\n\r\nhomes  are  required to utilise at least  80%  of  their  bed\r\n\r\ncapacity for category 3 and 4 patients who need a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher  level of nursing care and the new category  1  and  2\r\n\r\nresidents, that is, those needing a lesser level of care  and\r\n\r\nassistance  would not qualify for MOH's subsidy.   While  the\r\n\r\nprinciple   behind  this  move  to  ensure  the   appropriate\r\n\r\nutilisation  of nursing home resources is certainly  correct,\r\n\r\nthere  is cause for concern for the care delivery system  for\r\n\r\nthese  frail  senior  citizens is  currently  not  yet  well-developed to provide adequate support and assistance to these\r\n\r\nelderly  persons  and their families.  In  other  words,  are\r\n\r\nthere currently any other affordable residential institutions\r\n\r\nthat are able to accept the new category 1 and 2 patients, or\r\n\r\nis it the intention that they should be looked after at home?\r\n\r\nIf  they  should  be looked after at home, are  there  enough\r\n\r\nagencies,   I   would  expect  essentially  VWOs,   currently\r\n\r\nproviding  home  healthcare  services,  available  to  assist\r\n\r\nfamilies  to cope with this responsibility?  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister if he would give us an update of the situation  with\r\n\r\nregard to whether there have been cases during the past  year\r\n\r\nof  category  1  and  2  patients who have  had  difficulties\r\n\r\nfinding placement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to home healthcare services, are there other\r\n\r\npresent services we thought would be sufficient, if not, what\r\n\r\ninitiatives  have  been  put  in  place  to  encourage   more\r\n\r\nproviders to come forward?  I believe a new funding framework\r\n\r\nhas been or just about to be put in place which seeks to fund\r\n\r\nstep-down  care  through  approved  community  hospitals  and\r\n\r\nnursing homes.  Are these institutions able, at this point in\r\n\r\ntime,  to  rise  to the challenge of undertaking  to  provide\r\n\r\nthese  new  services?  Will this move unwittingly  result  in\r\n\r\nretarding the speed of growth of step-down care services?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister moves with his usual relentless efficiency.\r\n\r\nOne  is just concerned whether the VWO sector is able to keep\r\n\r\nup  with him.  The Inter-Ministerial Committee on the  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation has recommended, in its report, that MOH and  MCDS\r\n\r\nreview  the present division and responsibilities for  health\r\n\r\nand social care services to ensure that planning and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of these services, will facilitate  the  service\r\n\r\nproviders  who  want  to  look at  providing  community-based\r\n\r\nservices  and  in  the future development  of  more  holistic\r\n\r\nmodels  of  eldercare.  May I ask the Minister if  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen any progress in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me again assure Members here\r\n\r\nthat the healthcare for the elderly is a very key item in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's agenda.  I would just like to say that whatever  I\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now about the whole financing structure  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry applies equally well, if not more so, to the elderly,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  elderly  consumes  a  large  portion   of   the\r\n\r\nhealthcare services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have also been making special provisions\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly but I must stress that the elderly must play\r\n\r\ntheir  part  and  come  forward and  make  full  use  of  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare facilities and services that have been set up  for\r\n\r\nthem.   What  can the elderly do?  First of all, they  should\r\n\r\ntry  and  maintain  a  healthy lifestyle,  eat  sensibly  and\r\n\r\nexercise  regularly.  Second, they should take  part  in  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Health Screening Programme that we started in  July\r\n\r\nlast year.  The cost is minimal. The elderly pays only $5 for\r\n\r\nthe   screening,  which  costs  us  about   $20.    In   many\r\n\r\nconstituencies, in fact, the elderly is only required to  pay\r\n\r\n$3 or $2 and, even in some constituencies, just $1.  But only\r\n\r\n18%  of the eligible residents turned up to be screened.   Mr\r\n\r\nAng  Mong  Seng said that one reason for this low turnout  is\r\n\r\nthe  fear  of detecting medical problems which are costly  to\r\n\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the Members here and our elderly citizens\r\n\r\nthat  most  of  the  problems that the elderly  face  can  be\r\n\r\nmanaged at the polyclinic level.  And at the polyclinics, the\r\n\r\nelderly  enjoys a subsidy of 75%.  So it is very  affordable.\r\n\r\nFor  those who cannot co-pay the 25% portion, they can  apply\r\n\r\nto  the polyclinic for their fees to be waived.  I agree with\r\n\r\nall Members here who made the point that prevention is better\r\n\r\nthan cure that if the elderly were to manage their conditions\r\n\r\nproperly, this would prevent severe complications and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisabilities  down  the  road,  which  would  be  even   more\r\n\r\nexpensive  to  treat and lower the quality  of  life  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polyclinics run the Comprehensive Chronic Care\r\n\r\nProgramme (CCCP) to improve the management of diabetes,  high\r\n\r\nblood  pressure and high blood cholesterol.  The  polyclinics\r\n\r\nwill  remind those who are on this programme when the follow-up dates are due.  Dr Lily Neo asked for a one-stop diagnosis\r\n\r\nand  care planning centre.  In fact, our polyclinics  already\r\n\r\nserve this function.  As I said earlier, most of the kind  of\r\n\r\nproblems that the elderly face can be managed quite  well  at\r\n\r\nthe polyclinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also experimented by co-opting private sector\r\n\r\nGPs  in a pilot scheme to make healthcare more accessible  to\r\n\r\nthe elderly.  This is working well in the four areas that  we\r\n\r\nhave  started  the pilot scheme, and we will extend  this  to\r\n\r\nother  areas.   The elderly can look forward to seeing  their\r\n\r\nregular private GPs and continue to enjoy the same subsidy as\r\n\r\nthey do in the polyclinics, if they meet the means test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also assure Members that referrals of these\r\n\r\nelderly  by  the  participating GPs to specialist  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinics  will  also be at the subsidised rate.   In  time  to\r\n\r\ncome, the elderly will continue to enjoy subsidised rates  at\r\n\r\nthe specialist outpatient clinics, regardless of whether they\r\n\r\ngo  through  the polyclinic or their private sector  GPs,  as\r\n\r\nlong as they meet the means test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is acute care. We all know that\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  bills can be expensive and, therefore,  last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  offered  to pay the MediShield  premiums  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  for  two  years.  Making sure that  our  elderly  is\r\n\r\ncovered  by  MediShield will ensure that they will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to pay for their hospitalisation bills.  As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, the safety net provided by Medifund is also working.\r\n\r\nThe  elderly  takes up between 25% - 30% of our  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals'  Medifund disbursement.  I think  the  elderly  is\r\n\r\nwell  looked after in the primary care sector, as well as  in\r\n\r\nthe acute care sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the step-down care sector. Today,\r\n\r\nthe VWOs provide about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60% of the market share in the nursing homes.  The Government\r\n\r\nfunds  90%  of  the  development  cost  and  last  year,   we\r\n\r\nintroduced a new 3-tier subsidy level for the nursing  homes.\r\n\r\nWe  recognise that there is a shortage of nursing home places\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  we have taken steps to build  more  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes.   My Ministry is currently working with VWOs to  build\r\n\r\nanother  seven nursing homes. They will be ready in the  next\r\n\r\none   to  two  years.   The  Government  funds  90%  of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these seven nursing homes, which is about  $75\r\n\r\nmillion.  At the same time, we have put up plots of land  for\r\n\r\nprivate nursing home development.  Our long-term intention is\r\n\r\nto  allow  the  private sector to take up 40% of  the  market\r\n\r\nshare  by  the year 2010. Today it is 70:30, and by the  year\r\n\r\n2010, we hope to achieve 60:40 the share between VWOs and the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  We believe that this 60:40 share will better\r\n\r\nserve   the   different  socio-economic   segments   of   our\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Jennifer Lee and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about\r\n\r\nthe  other  provisions for nursing care and  step-down  care.\r\n\r\nLet  me just say that for the other forms of step-down  care,\r\n\r\nessentially  home medical and home nursing, we  have  several\r\n\r\nVWOs  providing  this  service. Today,  there  are  six  VWOs\r\n\r\nproviding  home  nursing to more than 4,000  patients.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  worked  with  the various VWOs  to  integrate  the\r\n\r\nservices  provided by the VWOs.  In July,  we  announced  the\r\n\r\nframework  for  integrated health services for  the  elderly.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a long-term plan to guide the developments  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  VWOs  in providing step-down care.  I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nabout my relentless efficiency, but I would like to assure Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee that since we are at the initial stages  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the plan, we will review this each  year.  So\r\n\r\nfar,  the  feedback  has  been very good  and  the  VWOs  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that  they  can step up their  provision  of  home\r\n\r\nmedical and home nursing services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the whole idea is to divide Singapore into\r\n\r\nthree  regions,  each  supported by the geriatric  and  other\r\n\r\ndepartments of each regional general hospital. Then, the VWOs\r\n\r\nwill run the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals and the nursing homes and the other forms\r\n\r\nof  step-down care - home medical and home nursing  services.\r\n\r\nThe  Government will provide the funds, the training and  the\r\n\r\nother  resources  for them to do so. We are  working  towards\r\n\r\nthis. We will proceed at a pace that the VWOs can deliver the\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that in the next 10 years, with this\r\n\r\nframework,  we  will be able to build up  all  the  necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities  to look after the elderly.  The other element  of\r\n\r\nthis is, of course, the financing framework.  Having built up\r\n\r\nall  the facilities and services, we must also make sure that\r\n\r\nthe elderly can afford to pay for it.  Again, in addition  to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said  earlier  about the  financing  framework  that\r\n\r\napplies  to the elderly, there are four things which we  have\r\n\r\ndone  to  make  sure that the elderly can  afford  all  these\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, we established the Eldercare Fund last year. This\r\n\r\nis  an  endowment  fund built up by the  Government's  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  The Government will inject another  $250  million\r\n\r\ninto the Eldercare Fund, bringing it up to $750 million.   We\r\n\r\nare  progressively building up the Eldercare  Fund  and  this\r\n\r\nwill  provide  subventions  to  the  various  step-down  care\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we implemented means testing and the 3-tier\r\n\r\nfunding for the nursing home residents since July last  year.\r\n\r\nI  am  happy to say that this 3-tier subsidy scheme has given\r\n\r\nmore  support to the nursing homes.  The funding  of  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  receiving  Government funding under  this  new  3-tier\r\n\r\nsystem  has  increased  by over 20%, as  more  residents  now\r\n\r\nqualify  for funding and at higher funding rates than before.\r\n\r\nThe Government's recurrent subsidy to step-down facilities is\r\n\r\n$31 million last year and we estimate that this will increase\r\n\r\nto  $100  million by the year 2010 and that  is  why  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding up our Eldercare Fund quite aggressively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third area, I am pleased to announce that we will\r\n\r\nextend Medifund to the residential step-down facilities  with\r\n\r\neffect from this year.  This measure will supplement the fund-raising  efforts of VWOs.  For this fiscal year, we will  set\r\n\r\naside $1.7 million from the Medifund\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  income  for this scheme.  Let me clarify  that  the\r\n\r\nextension  of  Medifund to VWOs is not meant to displace  the\r\n\r\nrole  of the community in raising funds for the VWOs, but  it\r\n\r\nshould be seen as complementing their efforts.  This is  part\r\n\r\nof our \"Many Helping Hands\" approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final component to make sure that healthcare is\r\n\r\naffordable  to  our  elderly will be to  establish  a  Severe\r\n\r\nDisability  Insurance  Scheme to  help  defray  out-of-pocket\r\n\r\nexpenses  in the event of severe disability. This  payout  is\r\n\r\nnot  only  for  those  in institutional care,  but  also  for\r\n\r\ndisabled  elderly who are cared for at home, using community-based services or home care services.  Our intention is  that\r\n\r\nMedisave  can  be used to pay the premiums of this  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme.   We  are actively working out the key parameters  of\r\n\r\nthis  policy and we hope to be able to introduce this  scheme\r\n\r\nin the fourth quarter of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have assured Members here that my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  put  in place a comprehensive package for looking  after\r\n\r\nour  elderly.   We  have  a  framework  to  set  up  all  the\r\n\r\nfacilities.   We can assure you that these facilities will be\r\n\r\nadequate in number and of an adequate standard, and that  the\r\n\r\nservices will be seamlessly integrated.  At the same time, we\r\n\r\nhave  also  put  in  place the financing  framework  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  and  we  can assure you that the services  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  at a price that the elderly can afford and sustain,\r\n\r\nand  also  at a price that we, as a society, can  afford  and\r\n\r\nsustain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I seek a clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister in his answer said\r\n\r\nthat  seven more nursing homes will be built and run by VWOs.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  know where are these homes  going  to  be\r\n\r\nlocated.   Will  they  be  located in  convenient  places  in\r\n\r\nhousing estates?  Or only nursing homes run by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, and the land tendered out at a  high  price,\r\n\r\nare going to be located in convenient places in HDB estates?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> All our nursing homes will be located\r\n\r\nclose   to  our  community,  because  that  is  an  important\r\n\r\nconsideration.  By the year 2010, we expect to have about 70-80  nursing homes.  So we can expect practically one  nursing\r\n\r\nhome  in  every constituency.  That is the kind of facilities\r\n\r\nwe need to have, because of the ageing population.  Today, we\r\n\r\nhave  50  nursing homes.  We are building another seven  more\r\n\r\nover the next two years, and we are going to tender land  for\r\n\r\na  few more private nursing homes.   Our plan calls for 70 to\r\n\r\n80  nursing  homes by the year 2010, which practically  means\r\n\r\none  nursing home in every constituency.  So Members will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  serve their residents quite well with  one  nursing\r\n\r\nhome per constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues   before  me  have  spoken  about  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices  for  the elderly, and the Minister has  assured  us\r\n\r\nabout the funding policy and the facilities.  But the key  to\r\n\r\nany  healthcare  policy  will be the doctors  themselves  and\r\n\r\nwithout  good  doctors, it will be difficult to  deliver  any\r\n\r\nform of quality healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructured hospitals have had a large number of\r\n\r\ntheir medical officers and specialists leaving the hospitals.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  that adjustments have been made to the salaries,\r\n\r\nand   with  these  adjustments  in  salaries  and   also   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly saturated private sector, the pull factors  have\r\n\r\ndiminished.  Also, the administrators that we have now appear\r\n\r\nto  be  much  more equipped to cope with the changing  health\r\n\r\nenvironment,  and it is time to address some  of  these  push\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical officers work extremely long hours and are\r\n\r\nthe work horses of the department, doing the bidding of their\r\n\r\nRegistrars  and the consultants.  If they do  not  intend  to\r\n\r\nspecialise, there is no career path for them, and there is no\r\n\r\nsystematic  training for them.  With such working  conditions\r\n\r\nand  no career development opportunities, there can be no job\r\n\r\nsatisfaction.  We need to look into this area and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat we need is a department that will look after their needs\r\n\r\nand future.  This is not just an administrative department to\r\n\r\ndeploy  them in one hospital or in one department, but beyond\r\n\r\nthat,  to  look  after their career plans, to look  at  their\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes and to help them seek  job  satisfaction\r\n\r\nand  job security.  Perhaps the Ministry may want to consider\r\n\r\nsetting up a medical officers division in each cluster, which\r\n\r\nwill look at the deployment, career planning and training for\r\n\r\nmedical officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to retain specialists. Some of the\r\n\r\nproblems that  specialists  face  include, for example,\r\n\r\nworkload. The  workload in the restructured hospitals  is\r\n\r\nextremely  high.  There is also pressure on the doctors  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to meet certain  \"lead times\"; in other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  time  from when the appointment is made to the time  the\r\n\r\ndoctor sees the patient, and also to reduce the waiting  time\r\n\r\nfor  patients.  When placed under pressure, doctors  work  in\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  conditions.   One  surgeon  in  one  of  the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals told me that it is a norm for his team\r\n\r\nto  see  between 40-60 new patients a morning,  or  at  least\r\n\r\nattempt  to see.  So you can imagine what sort of quality  of\r\n\r\ncare  he can deliver.  When one tries to impose certain  time\r\n\r\nlines  on the doctors, certain things will give.  And as  the\r\n\r\nconsultants are  so  busy  with  delivering  the   clinical\r\n\r\nservices, there is not much time that can be apportioned  to\r\n\r\nthe  training of more junior doctors, and these doctors later\r\n\r\non  in  life will become consultants.  So this is  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of specialists in the hospital is not\r\n\r\neven.   For  example, some hospitals like  NUH  will  have  a\r\n\r\nhigher portion of consultants in a department as compared  to\r\n\r\njunior  doctors, whereas some hospitals like  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital  will  have  comparatively fewer  consultants,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the workload would be comparable.  Hence, across-the-board,  on paper, it may seem that you may have an acceptable\r\n\r\nratio  of doctors to patients for different specialties,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is  a significant asymmetry or disparity from hospital\r\n\r\nto  hospital.  Perhaps the Ministry or the clusters may  want\r\n\r\nto take a more proactive approach in redistributing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe specialists so that the workload is evened out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also inter-departmental differences and these\r\n\r\nare  often  resolved at the medical board level  (differences\r\n\r\nbetween  departments, differences between specialties).   And\r\n\r\nbecause  the medical board is an internal board, many doctors\r\n\r\nor  departments may feel that if their head is not holding  a\r\n\r\nsignificant position there, they may not have a say.  One may\r\n\r\nwant  perhaps  to  consider  either  a  board  of  appeal  or\r\n\r\nseconding  doctors from outside that hospital to sit  on  the\r\n\r\nmedical board to give it a more unbiased perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time for us to relook at some of\r\n\r\nthese issues because, ultimately, retaining good doctors will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  improve the quality of healthcare in our healthcare\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, there has been quite a lot of\r\n\r\npublicity  lately  on  doctors in  the  public  sector.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has initiated various measures to stem the  exodus\r\n\r\nof  experienced  doctors from the public  service.   Doctors'\r\n\r\nsalaries   have   been  raised.   The   Ministry   has   also\r\n\r\nreintroduced  a faculty practice plan which allows  selective\r\n\r\nsenior  consultants  to  do part-time  work  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, and allows a reverse flow of similar doctors from the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some private doctors have indicated that these measures\r\n\r\nare  not  enough  to stop the exodus.  They claim  that  many\r\n\r\ndoctors left not because of pay.  Although I have yet to know\r\n\r\nany  one, including doctors, who openly admit that they leave\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  because of money, it is always  something  else.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  working conditions like  having  long  hours,\r\n\r\nunappreciative bosses and family sacrifices.   To  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent, these grouses may be true, as there will be in almost\r\n\r\nevery  profession.   Within the constraints  of  the  system,\r\n\r\nhowever,  remedial  measures can be taken  to  resolve  them.\r\n\r\nThis  could, however, be the chicken and egg situation.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  to  reduce the long working hours, we  can  recruit\r\n\r\nmore  doctors.  But this is one snag against the  outflow  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  to  the  private sector.   It  boils  down  then  to\r\n\r\nmanaging a balance of resources\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  constraints.

I would like to know the measures the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  taken,  apart from salary adjustments, to make  it  more\r\n\r\nconducive for doctors to stay in the public sector, given all\r\n\r\nthe operational constraints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, doctoring is becoming a\r\n\r\ndifficult profession.  Many have read in the papers  recently\r\n\r\nthat even doctors now are subject to abuse by members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Quite often, not surprisingly, almost  every  other\r\n\r\nmonth, you will read something in the papers that would carry\r\n\r\nnegative and sensational comments during legal suits  against\r\n\r\ndoctors,  and  these reports put doctors in a  very  negative\r\n\r\nlight.   And  during  legal  suits, usually  the  sensational\r\n\r\ncomments   put  up  by  the  prosecution  would   always   be\r\n\r\nhighlighted and the defence side is always so boring, because\r\n\r\nthey just relate the facts and are usually not carried.   And\r\n\r\nthat  gives  a  distorted image of how doctors perform  their\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not forget that doctors are human beings. Yes,\r\n\r\nthey can prolong life, but they are unable to ensure that all\r\n\r\noutcomes  will  be  what  patients  expect.   Even  the  best\r\n\r\nsurgeons  in  the world cannot ensure that all  his  patients\r\n\r\nwill  have good outcomes.  We need to put the work of doctors\r\n\r\nin  the right perspective.  Doctors work long hours and  have\r\n\r\nvery  little  social life.  It is one of the few  professions\r\n\r\nthat they have to work virtually every day, including Sundays\r\n\r\nand  public  holidays.  Doctors do their  best  to  give  the\r\n\r\npatients  the  best of care.  But due to the  constraints  of\r\n\r\ntime, the constraints of the workload, they may not always be\r\n\r\nable to give the best that they want to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I am a visiting consultant to one of the\r\n\r\nhospitals  -  Tan Tock Seng Hospital  - and I can see that in\r\n\r\na  hospital like that, where the workload is extremely heavy,\r\n\r\nthey  have  very few consultants.  And because of  that,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrars  and  the medical officers do not get  any  formal\r\n\r\ntraining programme.  Unless we improve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  services,  we will not be able to lighten the  workload,\r\n\r\nimprove  the  quality  of  care.  One  must  understand  that\r\n\r\ndoctors  have  a  very  difficult time  in  the  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals.    And   the   recent  newspaper   report,   which\r\n\r\nhighlighted the routine of the doctor, does help to give  the\r\n\r\npublic  an insight into what sort of time lines doctors  have\r\n\r\nto  meet.  The perception is always distorted because, to the\r\n\r\ndoctor,  he has 60 patients to look after.  But to a  person,\r\n\r\nhis  relative is the most important person, and why  can  the\r\n\r\ndoctor not give him that due attention and that due time that\r\n\r\nis needed for his relative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Health has allowed a reverse\r\n\r\nbrain  drain, tapping the private sector expertise,  and  has\r\n\r\nactually brought in some specialists from the private  sector\r\n\r\nback  into  the public sector.  This has generally been  well\r\n\r\nreceived  by  the public for beefing up the services  in  the\r\n\r\nrestructured hospitals.  Ultimately, the aim is to tap on the\r\n\r\ntalent  pool so that if we can draw either foreign talent  or\r\n\r\nlocal  private sector talent, we will be able to improve  the\r\n\r\nworkload.  And that will mean that there is increased quality\r\n\r\ntime  for  patients, and we will also be able to improve  the\r\n\r\ntraining of doctors, which means that they can deliver better\r\n\r\ncare  to  the  patients.  Perhaps the Minister  can  tell  us\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are  any  other  plans  to  perhaps  tap  the\r\n\r\nresources  outside  the  public  hospitals  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nworkload on the doctors in the public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on primary healthcare. Because of\r\n\r\nour  involvement in new towns, we began to learn a bit  about\r\n\r\nhow  primary healthcare delivery is done in the new town.   I\r\n\r\nwas  surprised  that when we had a population  of  more  than\r\n\r\n20,000 households, which would be equivalent to roughly  half\r\n\r\nthe  size of Ang Mo Kio town, we only had two clinics  tucked\r\n\r\nin one corner of the estate.  In other words, all we had were\r\n\r\ntwo  clinics  providing  primary healthcare  service  to  the\r\n\r\nentire  estate.   When  I  raised  this  with  the  different\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments, it appeared that  everybody  thought\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  a good thing to locate clinics  only  in   big\r\n\r\nshopping malls.  But I raised the point that when people  are\r\n\r\nsick, they do not want to take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buses. They do not want to drive a car to a shopping mall\r\n\r\nto see a doctor.  They want to be able to walk to the nearest\r\n\r\nclinic which is within walking distance to seek treatment and\r\n\r\nrelief  for their illness.  At the meetings that we had  with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  I was given to understand that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have any planning advice or planning norms  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat sort of number of clinics that we should provide in  the\r\n\r\nnew  housing estates.  Perhaps the Ministry may  want  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  proactive  in  this  area in  coordination  with  other\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as a town grows, there is a growing need for a\r\n\r\npublic  primary healthcare service in the form of polyclinics\r\n\r\nor  other forms of public primary healthcare service,  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided in this growing new town.  Perhaps the Minister  can\r\n\r\nhelp  enlighten me as to what the Ministry's  plans  are  for\r\n\r\nthis new town.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I intend to stop discussion on this\r\n\r\namendment  at 3.00 o'clock.  So I think we have to  press  on\r\n\r\nwith relentless efficiency.  We want to give other Members  a\r\n\r\nchance to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nParliament  recently passed the Health Promotion Board  Bill.\r\n\r\nWith  the formation of a new statutory board, ie, the  Health\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board,  Singaporeans can look forward  to  a  more\r\n\r\nfocused,  integrated  and concentrated  approach  for  better\r\n\r\nhealth  outcomes.  The Board will spearhead health education,\r\n\r\npromotion  and  prevention  programmes  to  overcome   health\r\n\r\nproblems in children, adults and the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the functions of the Board is to provide\r\n\r\nmedical,  dental, health screening and immunisation  services\r\n\r\nto  school children and all other persons.  I believe this is\r\n\r\na  good  move by the MOH because they can monitor the medical\r\n\r\nhistory  of  all  Singaporeans.  I wish to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministry could set up a central registry  of  all\r\n\r\nthe medical records of all Singaporeans from birth until they\r\n\r\nreach  old  age.  This move will allow Singaporeans  to  know\r\n\r\nmore about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  medical history.  They can also provide  this  medical\r\n\r\nhistory  to  their respective doctors who are treating  them.\r\n\r\nThis  may  save  them  time and perhaps  cost  while  getting\r\n\r\ntreatment for their present illnesses.  The doctors can  also\r\n\r\nadvise them to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent  their\r\n\r\nprevious illnesses from recurring again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could comment on these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, on the premise\r\n\r\nthat  our people are our key resource in the country,  it  is\r\n\r\nincumbent   upon   the  Government  to  ensure   that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean, regardless of age, stays as healthy as  possible\r\n\r\nthroughout  his life.  I believe there is no  better  way  to\r\n\r\nensure  this than to inculcate healthy living habits so  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans ultimately embrace a healthy lifestyle and  lead\r\n\r\na balanced life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a recognised fact that from the student bench\r\n\r\nin   our   schools  to  the  workbench  in  our   workplaces,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, young and old, are subjected to an increasingly\r\n\r\ncompetitive and stressful environment.  Adoption of a healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle  can  help  Singaporeans  cope  better   with   the\r\n\r\npressures  of  life,  provided they  know  how.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon for us to stumble upon reports of increasing obesity\r\n\r\namong  students  in our schools, higher incidence  of  breast\r\n\r\ncancer  among our women, and Singaporeans' increased exposure\r\n\r\nto coronary heart disease.  Much of these may be attributable\r\n\r\nto  stress, poor eating habits and lack of physical exercise.\r\n\r\nI  am particularly happy to note the Minister announcing  the\r\n\r\n68%  increase  in health promotional programmes  earlier  but\r\n\r\nwould  nevertheless like to pose the following  measures  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider, so as to increase awareness of the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  a healthy lifestyle while also enhancing  the\r\n\r\nalready  available infrastructure so that Singaporeans  could\r\n\r\nbenefit from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Health Ministry should consider forging a\r\n\r\nstrong  and  compelling healthy lifestyle vision  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthis  objective.  I know Sports for Life was launched several\r\n\r\nyears ago but I think this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis not comprehensive enough for a healthy lifestyle vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Ministry's preventive healthcare and health\r\n\r\neducation programmes should be beefed up and publicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in conjunction with the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, more health clubs or exercise facilities  should\r\n\r\nbe built in HDB and industrial estates to encourage people to\r\n\r\nexercise  more  and  stay  fit.  Facilities  should  be  made\r\n\r\navailable and easily accessible for Singaporeans to  exercise\r\n\r\nat  or  near  their homes or workplaces.  Wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nmake  these  available for free or levy very  small  fees  if\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary to charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, facilities in housing estates should be family-friendly to encourage whole families to indulge in healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyle.   When  entire  families  begin  working  out   in\r\n\r\ncommunity health clubs, they not only do something for  their\r\n\r\nhealth  but  also meet other families doing the  same  thing.\r\n\r\nThis  also  achieves the much desired effect of strengthening\r\n\r\ncommunity bonds within the neighbourhood.  It is like killing\r\n\r\ntwo birds with one stone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Health Ministry should seriously\r\n\r\nconsider implementing the recommended two-pronged approach to\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the healthcare needs of the elderly,  as  put\r\n\r\nforth  by  the Inter-Ministerial Committee on healthcare  for\r\n\r\nelderly: firstly, health promotion and disease prevention  to\r\n\r\nenable   the  elderly  remain  healthy  and  active  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity; secondly, when disease and disability set in,  the\r\n\r\nsystem must be able to provide appropriate and cost-effective\r\n\r\nhealthcare according to each elderly person's needs so as  to\r\n\r\nachieve maximum functional capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further help the elderly, the Government could\r\n\r\nconsider giving them special rebates when they buy healthcare\r\n\r\nproducts,  such  as vitamins and special food supplements  to\r\n\r\nkeep themselves healthy and fit.  Perhaps the Health Ministry\r\n\r\ncould  work with NTUC Healthcare for consideration of special\r\n\r\ndiscounts when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens  purchase health products in  their  stores,\r\n\r\nconsidering the fact that the aged have to fork out  more  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  announced that it would embark  on  a  systematic\r\n\r\nhealth  screening programme in collaboration with  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations   to   detect   diabetes,   hypertension    and\r\n\r\ncholesterol level in people who are aged 55 years and  above.\r\n\r\nI  wholly support such a programme as I think it will benefit\r\n\r\nus  greatly  in  the long term.  At a personal  level,  early\r\n\r\ndetection  and treatment can help stave off the complications\r\n\r\nthat  may  arise from such medical conditions.  On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  from  a  national standpoint, such  measures  help  to\r\n\r\nreduce   the  long-term  cost  of  medical  care  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  have to shoulder.  As an illustration,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of treating stroke patients can be very substantial  as\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  patients require long stay in hospitals  and\r\n\r\nextensive rehabilitation.  However, we know that the risk  of\r\n\r\ngetting stroke can be reduced significantly if blood pressure\r\n\r\nand  the  level  of cholesterol in the body is monitored  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled regularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much as I welcome the Government's initiative in\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I do have one request.  Perhaps the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  consider  extending health screening exercise  beyond\r\n\r\njust   monitoring  diabetes,  hypertension  and   cholesterol\r\n\r\nlevels.   Presently, there are tests that are available  that\r\n\r\nwill  enable one to detect other forms of serious  illnesses.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  there are blood tests that  will  screen  for\r\n\r\ncertain   forms  of  cancer,  and  we  can  identify  certain\r\n\r\nresidents with a predisposition towards such illnesses,  from\r\n\r\nfamily   records  perhaps,  and  refer  them  for  additional\r\n\r\nscreening.  The cost of such screening may be higher than the\r\n\r\nscreening  that  is  presently  offered  under  our  national\r\n\r\nprogramme.  However, I believe early detection and  treatment\r\n\r\ncan  help  the State to spend less on healthcare in the  long\r\n\r\nrun.   The  principle is simple.  It may be better  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore  now on health screening than to have to spend  a  whole\r\n\r\nlot more in treatment later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider extending the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscope  of  our  health screening programme to  include  other\r\n\r\nforms of illnesses as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Obviously, there is not very much\r\n\r\ntime  for  me  to deal with all of the many good suggestions.\r\n\r\nSo  I would seek Members' indulgence that we will follow this\r\n\r\nup  in greater detail after this session.  Let me just in the\r\n\r\nnext  six  minutes  respond to some of the key  points  which\r\n\r\nMembers have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think managing doctors is a very important task. It\r\n\r\nis not just a HR management issue.  The medical profession is\r\n\r\na  demanding profession which requires very committed  people\r\n\r\nworking  under very difficult conditions.  So I take  in  all\r\n\r\nthe suggestions raised by Mr Bernard Chen and Dr Michael Lim.\r\n\r\nObviously,  our  approach towards this  is  not  just  salary\r\n\r\nadjustments.  We know that we have to keep up with  the  pay,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  also  a  whole host of other  things  -  working\r\n\r\nconditions, training, sense of public service, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that we are working at this.\r\n\r\nWe  intend to keep our fair share of talent.  But just to put\r\n\r\nall  these  reports in perspective, there are two  groups  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  that  we  are  dealing with.   One  is  the  medical\r\n\r\nofficers  (MOs) whom we have to train and who have  to  serve\r\n\r\nfive  years  of  bond  with  us.   The  other  group  is  the\r\n\r\nconsultants, who after their training, can either  stay  with\r\n\r\nus  or  go  to  the private sector.  Dealing with  these  two\r\n\r\ngroups,  of  course, requires different considerations.   For\r\n\r\nthe  MOs,  we want to make sure we give them a good grounding\r\n\r\nin training, so that if they leave us and become GPs outside,\r\n\r\nthey would have a good exposure to all the key departments in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals so that they would be good family  physicians.\r\n\r\nBut  while they are with us for the five years, we should not\r\n\r\ntreat  them  as cheap labour.  We should pay them competitive\r\n\r\nrates  and  we should treat them as we should treat  all  our\r\n\r\nemployees.  So this requires a bit of a mindset change in the\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  I can assure you that we are working  towards\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the consultants, whether they stay with us or not,\r\n\r\nreally we have to manage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  just  like  any other employees that  we  manage.   The\r\n\r\nhospitals  have  put in place several measures  to  make  the\r\n\r\nrestructured  hospitals  a more attractive  place  for  these\r\n\r\nconsultants to work in.  This faculty practice scheme is  one\r\n\r\nway  to  remove  this very sharp divide between  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and  the  public sector.  We will  have  to  continue\r\n\r\nworking  at  different measures to make sure that the  public\r\n\r\nsector  has  a fair share of talent and provides the  service\r\n\r\nthat is required or expected by Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to primary healthcare. On this point\r\n\r\nabout  setting up clinics in new towns, our preference is  to\r\n\r\nlet  the  private sector determine the setting up of clinics.\r\n\r\nI  think it is very hard for the Ministry to dictate how many\r\n\r\nclinics  should be set up by the private sector in  each  new\r\n\r\ntown.  So the private sector will obviously respond once they\r\n\r\nknow  that  Sengkang is building up.  If there are  only  two\r\n\r\nclinics  and people there have to be served, you  can  expect\r\n\r\nmore private sector GPs to set up clinics there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as polyclinic is concerned, our policy is to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  polyclinic when the population in  the  new  town\r\n\r\nbuilds  up to a certain level.  Therefore, I am happy to  say\r\n\r\nthat  Sengkang is building up nicely  and we are planning  to\r\n\r\nbuild a polyclinic there, and we will build it in due course.\r\n\r\nOf  course, it will not appear overnight.  It takes three  or\r\n\r\nfour years for us to plan, locate the site and actually build\r\n\r\nthe  polyclinic.  But I can assure you that a  polyclinic  in\r\n\r\nSengkang will be built in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ibrahim asked whether the Ministry will set up a\r\n\r\ncentral registry of medical records.  Today, the records  are\r\n\r\nalready  in  a  few key areas.  When you are in  school,  the\r\n\r\nschool  health system has a record.  When you enter  national\r\n\r\nservice, MINDEF has a record.  When you enter any one of  our\r\n\r\ntwo clusters in the public sector, we have your records.   So\r\n\r\nI  think  we should improve the record-keeping in  these  key\r\n\r\nareas  first.  Whether we combine all of them into a  central\r\n\r\nregistry, we have to proceed a bit more carefully, because we\r\n\r\nhave to be very careful about privacy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  information, particularly of medical information.  I know\r\n\r\nthe  technology allows us, but we would prefer to  proceed  a\r\n\r\nbit  more  carefully,  to make sure  that  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  preserve  the  confidentiality  of  all  this\r\n\r\ninformation before we embark on this central registry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad posed many good suggestions about preventive\r\n\r\nhealthcare and health promotion.  I think we will hoist  them\r\n\r\nin.   I  just want to respond to his suggestion about special\r\n\r\nrebates  for  vitamins and supplements for the elderly.   The\r\n\r\ndoctors  tell me that if the elderly eat sensibly, they  have\r\n\r\nall  the necessary vitamins and supplements they need to live\r\n\r\na  long  and healthy life.  So they tell me that a rebate  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary.   The  only case they  tell  me  is  probably\r\n\r\ncalcium supplements to make sure their bone mass is good  and\r\n\r\nthey  do not have early osteoporosis.  I am told that calcium\r\n\r\nsupplements are not very expensive.  So, again, there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed for special rebates.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann suggested that we undertake screening in\r\n\r\na  more  aggressive  way.  Let me assure  him,  that  is  our\r\n\r\nintention,  provided it makes sense.  We  have  done  so  for\r\n\r\ndiabetes, high blood pressure and blood cholesterol.  But for\r\n\r\na  national screening exercise to be effective, we must  look\r\n\r\nat  the  whole scale plus the payoff.  And for these  chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses,  there is a good payoff, and therefore,  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  evidence  and  research, we are  embarking  on  it.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  our  community health screening  process  is  barely\r\n\r\nstarted.  We need to plug at it, and I am sure in five to  10\r\n\r\nyears'  time, we will start to enjoy the fruits of that  very\r\n\r\nmassive national screening exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific examples of cancer, there are some\r\n\r\ncancers  which  are amenable to national screening  exercises\r\n\r\nand  some which are not.  Colorectal cancer, for example,  is\r\n\r\nnot  amenable to a national screening exercise.

Sir, many Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about rising medical costs and this is  especially\r\n\r\nso  for the elderly folks in our midst who have no income but\r\n\r\nhave  increasing  medical  needs.   In  time  to  come,  this\r\n\r\nincreasing  burden will affect even more people  due  to  our\r\n\r\nfast  ageing population.  I would therefore like to urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health to have good plans, insurance schemes  and\r\n\r\nvarious  safety  nets put in place to ensure  the  affordable\r\n\r\nlong-term healthcare for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we observe the 10 basic\r\n\r\ntenets for such long-term healthcare as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The culture of self-reliance and taking personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The premise that early preventive measures are\r\n\r\npreferable  and  more effective than later  interventions  at\r\n\r\npoints of crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The view that the family unit, with adequate\r\n\r\nsupport,  is  the principal way to provide care in  the  home\r\n\r\nenvironment rather than residential care.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The recognition that residential care is costly and\r\n\r\ncauses loss of independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The need to involve the communities to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe elderly to stay in the communities and at their own homes\r\n\r\nfor as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Funding for long-term healthcare must be fair,\r\n\r\nequitable  to all generations and sustainable over  the  long\r\n\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) A combination of services may be required, including\r\n\r\npersonal  or medical care, equipment, transport and  domestic\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Older people often have a variety of inter-related\r\n\r\nneeds,  including nutrition, nursing, medication and mobility\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The importance of support for family and other\r\n\r\ninformal caregivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The role of the different professions in delivering\r\n\r\ncost effective and life enhancing care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for Health to\r\n\r\nincorporate the above important considerations to ensure  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of the care of long-term medical needs.  Success  in\r\n\r\nthis  area  will  lessen the burden of Singaporeans  and  the\r\n\r\nstate in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you carry on with your next cut, Dr\r\n\r\nNeo?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Yes, Sir. Nurses constitute an integral\r\n\r\nand  important  part  of any healthcare system.   Success  in\r\n\r\ntraining  nurses  and training enough of them  is  vital  for\r\n\r\nsustaining the excellent and efficient healthcare  system  we\r\n\r\nnow enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nurses who are well trained can do a lot and they\r\n\r\ncontribute  not only to better care of patients but  also  to\r\n\r\nlower  costs in healthcare delivery.  It is very much cheaper\r\n\r\nto  maintain  a nurse as compared to, let us say,  a  doctor.\r\n\r\nWell-trained  nurses  can carry out many functions  otherwise\r\n\r\nperformed  by  doctors and this frees the  latter  for  other\r\n\r\nduties.   A  nurse in a community clinic can  be  trained  to\r\n\r\ncheck patients and assess them for appropriate referral, give\r\n\r\npost-operative care, make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomiciliary   visits  and  monitor  patients   with   chronic\r\n\r\nillnesses.   Nurses can be trained to provide  care  in  very\r\n\r\nspecialised  situations too.  They can  be  trained  to  look\r\n\r\nafter   vexing  psychiatric  and  dementia  patients,  taxing\r\n\r\nbedridden  and  incontinent  stroke  patients  as   well   as\r\n\r\ndisheartening terminally ill patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we try to cope with our ageing problem, nurses\r\n\r\nwill be required in even greater numbers.  The challenge  for\r\n\r\nus  is not only in having adequate numbers of nurses but also\r\n\r\nin  training  enough  of them for the  impending  demands  of\r\n\r\neldercare.   As  our  policy will be to assist  older  people\r\n\r\nremain  as  independently for as long as possible, preferably\r\n\r\nin  their  own homes, more courses are needed to  train  more\r\n\r\nnurses for the community care setting to achieve this end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from training the nurses, the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nshould  also have courses that cater for healthcare  workers.\r\n\r\nThese  healthcare  workers can be full-time  paid  personnel,\r\n\r\nfamily  members,  community  volunteers,  and  so  on.   Such\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers can be trained in a matter of a few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn  England, it takes only three weeks of intensive  training\r\n\r\nto  equip them with the necessary skills.  They are certified\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  the course which teaches them  in  assisted\r\n\r\nfeeding,  catheter care, prosthesis use, simple dressing  and\r\n\r\nsimple grooming as in toenail cutting for non-diabetics using\r\n\r\nsterile techniques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still very short of nurses in Singapore. Whilst\r\n\r\nI  feel  that the Ministry of Health must seriously  consider\r\n\r\ntraining  more healthcare workers to help ease this shortage,\r\n\r\nI urge that we have to do much more to increase our supply of\r\n\r\nnurses.   I am glad that the Ministry of Health has  taken  a\r\n\r\nstep  in  the  right  direction with an  upward  revision  of\r\n\r\nnurses' salaries from 1st June this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not only necessary to make the nursing\r\n\r\nprofession noble; it is also necessary to make the job family-friendly  and  lucrative in terms of both career  development\r\n\r\nand monetary unions.  Shall I go on to my last cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Rehabilitation. Sir, everyone who has had\r\n\r\nan  illness or accident needs some time to recover.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  need  rehabilitation.  Older  people  who  need\r\n\r\nrehabilitation usually suffer from a wide range of conditions\r\n\r\nand their needs are often complex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitation involves restoration to the maximum\r\n\r\ndegree  possible, either of function (physical or mental)  or\r\n\r\nrole  (within  the  family,  social  network  or  workforce).\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  usually  requires  a  mixture  of   clinical,\r\n\r\ntherapeutic and social interventions that also address issues\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  a  person's  physical and  social  environment.\r\n\r\nEffective rehabilitation needs to be responsive to the  needs\r\n\r\nand  wishes  of  the user and has to be purposeful  with  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of a number of agencies and disciplines.  It must\r\n\r\nalso be made easily available when required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is strong evidence that comprehensive\r\n\r\nassessments,  followed by implementation of  individual  care\r\n\r\nplans,  can reduce the risk of older people being re-admitted\r\n\r\nto  hospitals or placed in long-stay care.  It also  improves\r\n\r\nsurvival rates and physical and cognitive functioning.  To do\r\n\r\nall these, we need the involvement of relevant therapists, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  we  need  occupational  therapists,  speech  and\r\n\r\nlanguage therapists and physiotherapist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Health if he\r\n\r\nwould  ensure that we have enough of such therapists to  give\r\n\r\npatients the ideal rehabilitation they require and whether he\r\n\r\nwould expand this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Sir, it is very easy to answer Dr Lily\r\n\r\nNeo's questions.

Laser devices are being used  freely.   This  is\r\n\r\nborne  out by the profusion of advertisements promoting  hair\r\n\r\nremoval  by  beauticians using \"FDA approved light  activated\r\n\r\nsystems\".  It is likely that Class 4 Laser Devices are  being\r\n\r\nused  for  this  and  this  would  contravene  the  Radiation\r\n\r\nProtection  Act  which states that non-medical  professionals\r\n\r\nare  licensed to operate only Class 1, 2, 3a and  3b  lasers.\r\n\r\nOther  procedures  performed by beauticians include  silicone\r\n\r\ninjections  to the nose and breast, removal of tattoos  using\r\n\r\nCO2 lasers and blepharoplasties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do they contravene the Medical Registration\r\n\r\nAct,  these beauticians also pose potential hazards when they\r\n\r\n\"operate\"  on  unwary clients.  Sir, many  beauty  treatments\r\n\r\nhave  gone  horribly  wrong because  people  have  been  ill-informed   and   were  taken  in  by  misleading   and   bait\r\n\r\nadvertisements, especially for blemish removal, eye-lids  and\r\n\r\nnose jobs.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of what use are the Acts if such illegal activities\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  flourish unchecked?  Medical professionals  are\r\n\r\nbrought to task for advertising themselves, let alone  making\r\n\r\nmisrepresented advertisements, but beauticians  are  free  to\r\n\r\nadvertise,  lure and treat customers.  Sir, these beauticians\r\n\r\nare  not  authorised to perform invasive  surgery,  and  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  stopped.

These hair dyes contain diamine,\r\n\r\nor  its  derivatives, which is listed  as  a  poison  in  the\r\n\r\nPoisons  Act.   A  high  proportion of  the  pharmacies  they\r\n\r\nsurveyed  did  not  have  control  procedures  in  place,  as\r\n\r\nrequired by the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paraphrase and re-raise the questions that were\r\n\r\nmentioned then, which have not been answered by the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Is the level of diamine in hair dyes so high that\r\n\r\nthey  pose a danger to users?  Other countries in the  world,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  in the developed countries  of  Europe  and\r\n\r\nAmerica,  permit the sale of such hair dyes over the counter,\r\n\r\nwithout  requiring the supervision of pharmacists.  They  are\r\n\r\nalso freely available over the counter in Malaysia, and Johor\r\n\r\nBaru is just a short drive away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If they are really so poisonous, why were the\r\n\r\npharmacists so lax in the control of these sales?  And if the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the pharmacists is so critical, then  why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  untrained and unsupervised hairstylists in hair saloons\r\n\r\ncan   use  these  dyes  without  any  safety  procedures   or\r\n\r\ndocumentation  of  use?  The Ministry promised  to  prosecute\r\n\r\nerrant  pharmacists, but there has been no news of  any  such\r\n\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Why is such a common cosmetic item being sold under\r\n\r\nlock  and  key?  Why are we adding a layer of very  expensive\r\n\r\nprofessionals for the sale of something that everywhere  else\r\n\r\nin  the world is sold over the counter?  Are we unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncreating  a statutory monopoly to help pharmacists make  ends\r\n\r\nmeet?  Why are we inconveniencing consumers, who can only buy\r\n\r\nthese  items at times when the pharmacists are in, ie,  their\r\n\r\noffice hours, and this means strict hours of 10.00 am to 5.00\r\n\r\npm, Sundays and holidays excluded, and with a 2-hour lunch in\r\n\r\nbetween?  Such artificial restriction on supply, in the  face\r\n\r\nof  increasing  demand and the intervention of  professionals\r\n\r\nwho  do not serve any purpose, will only serve to jack up the\r\n\r\nfinal price of the product.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Is there no other way of warning consumers to use\r\n\r\nthe  product carefully without using pharmacists, such as  by\r\n\r\nappropriate  labelling on the packaging  and  a  minimum  age\r\n\r\nrequirement for the purchase of these products?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can address these questions without\r\n\r\nany further delay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, unlike the beauticians, in this\r\n\r\ncase, we agree with Prof. Toh.
