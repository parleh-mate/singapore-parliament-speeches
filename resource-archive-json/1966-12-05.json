These   are   private    kindergartens\r\n\r\nregistered  with  the  Ministry  of  Education,   those\r\n\r\norganised  and supervised by the People's  Association,\r\n\r\nand  creches and play centres organised and  supervised\r\n\r\nby   the   Department  of  Social  Welfare.  Owing   to\r\n\r\nGovernment supervision of one kind or another, it would\r\n\r\nbe  extremely difficult for anti-national  elements  to\r\n\r\npoison  the minds of young children unnoticed. To  date\r\n\r\nthere  has  been no report of such incidents  in  these\r\n\r\nkindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for quite some time now, the demand for\r\n\r\nplaces in kindergartens for pre-school age children has\r\n\r\nbeen very great. This results in the establishment of a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of unregistered kindergartens which  fall\r\n\r\ninto   three  categories:  (1)  those  run  by  private\r\n\r\nindividuals catering for the upper and middle  classes,\r\n\r\nmainly  in  the private residential estates; (2)  those\r\n\r\nrun by religious organisations in Housing Board Estates\r\n\r\nor  near squatter areas in the City area; (3) those run\r\n\r\nby political parties, particularly by the anti-national\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. These kindergartens do not come under\r\n\r\nthe  supervision of the Government and are,  therefore,\r\n\r\nopen  to  exploitation  by the anti-national  elements,\r\n\r\nparticularly so in the case of those run by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  in  the rural areas. Besides the  opportunity\r\n\r\nafforded them to poison the minds of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  young children in their kindergarten classes,  the\r\n\r\nteachers  of these classes and their helpers,  who  are\r\n\r\nmostly  members  of  the Barisan Sosialis,  very  often\r\n\r\nexploit the opportunity of meeting the parents of these\r\n\r\nchildren  and  putting  across  their  insidious  anti-national  propaganda. Furthermore,  these  kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses also provide a source of income to sustain  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the Barisan Sosialis members.  However,\r\n\r\nthe Government does not favour the negative approach in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  this  problem by closing  down  all  the\r\n\r\nkindergartens run by the anti-national elements. To  do\r\n\r\nso would fall into the trap of the Barisan Sosialis who\r\n\r\nare   bound  to  exploit  the  issue  by  accusing  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of being unsympathetic towards the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the children of the poor living particularly in the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a real demand for pre-school education by\r\n\r\nSingapore  parents  in  recent years  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nimprovement in the standard of living and the awareness\r\n\r\nof  the value of an early education for children.  This\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, a social problem which should be better\r\n\r\ndealt  with in a more positive manner. Since 1964,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has,  through  the  People's  Association,\r\n\r\nestablished  kindergarten  classes  in  the   community\r\n\r\ncentres to meet the needs of the rural parents  and  to\r\n\r\ncounter  the influence of kindergarten classes  run  by\r\n\r\nthe  anti-national  elements. By  May  this  year,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association have established 159 kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses  with  a total enrolment of 5,900  pupils.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of classes has since increased to 349  and  the\r\n\r\ntotal  enrolment to 12,500, whereas both the number  of\r\n\r\nclasses run by the anti-national elements and the total\r\n\r\nenrolment  have  drastically dwindled.  Furthermore,  a\r\n\r\ngreat  majority  of the kindergarten age  children  for\r\n\r\nclasses  next year have been registered by the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is desirable that all kindergartens should\r\n\r\nbe  supervised  by the Government and be brought  under\r\n\r\nthe   Republic   educational  system,   the   cost   of\r\n\r\nimplementing  this  by  way of  capital  and  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure is, however, prohibitive.

This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is not possible to deal with the  mosquito\r\n\r\nproblem of Singapore on a piecemeal basis, as are shown\r\n\r\nin the results of a field survey without house-to-house\r\n\r\nchecks  done  on the 24th of November, 1966,  in  Anson\r\n\r\nConstituency itself. The results are no less  than  107\r\n\r\nbreeding  places, mainly due to mosquitoes breeding  in\r\n\r\nwater-bearing  receptacles  found  in  scrap  dumps  of\r\n\r\nsecond-hand   dealers,   water   storage    tanks    in\r\n\r\nunauthorised dwellings, stagnant water in drains caused\r\n\r\nby  refuse  thrown into them by hawkers  and  residents\r\n\r\nover a very long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of second-hand goods dealers in this area are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the dumping of discarded  receptacles\r\n\r\nwhich  in  turn become breeding places for  mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  long-time process and it is  difficult  to\r\n\r\neradicate the mosquito menace within a short time.

He  did  mention  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  was  going  to set up an Anti-Mosquito  Unit.\r\n\r\nSir,  after a lapse of almost 12 months, I am wondering\r\n\r\nwhether this Unit has, in fact, been set up and whether\r\n\r\nwork  has  been carried out to eradicate  the  mosquito\r\n\r\nmenace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  question of an Anti-Mosquito Unit was first raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  of  Health and this  Unit  has  been\r\n\r\nestablished. But because of the shortage of staff,  the\r\n\r\nwork  of this Unit cannot be launched on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAs  I have already said, the Public Health Division  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health is now preparing various schemes\r\n\r\nand  is  in liaison with the various sections. So  when\r\n\r\nall this preparatory work is done, a proper scheme will\r\n\r\nbe launched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question about the Anti-Mosquito Unit is\r\n\r\nthat,  at  the  present moment, this Unit  has  already\r\n\r\ncarried  out  work in various areas in Singapore  on  a\r\n\r\nregional basis. It is not possible to do the work on an\r\n\r\nextensive basis because of the reasons I have given. So\r\n\r\nI  would  like to appeal to Members in this  House,  as\r\n\r\nthey  are very concerned with the mosquito menace, that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest  thing for them to do at the present moment is  to\r\n\r\nstart a cleansing campaign in their own constituencies,\r\n\r\nor    an   anti-mosquito   campaign   in   their    own\r\n\r\nconstituencies. That is more effective at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Another\r\n\r\nsupplementary  question, Mr Speaker. From  the  answer\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Parliamentary Secretary, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask him a further question on this point. If his scheme\r\n\r\ncannot  be implemented within a year, then do not  tell\r\n\r\nme  that  the  people of Singapore have to be  tolerant\r\n\r\nabout  mosquito bites for some more time. I  appeal  to\r\n\r\nhim,  as he has already indicated that this problem  is\r\n\r\nactually dependent on the question of staff. Because of\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of staff, he says he cannot carry out his\r\n\r\nwork  as  scheduled. I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he is prepared to consider employing temporary\r\n\r\nstaff  to eradicate the mosquito menace, because if  it\r\n\r\ngets out of hand, then there will be epidemics all over\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the mosquito menace is getting  more  and\r\n\r\nmore interesting. But it is a question which requires a\r\n\r\nlong  time to solve. I can assure Members that  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment  it is not just the question  of  staff\r\n\r\nthat  is  bothering us. As one can read from the  local\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  the  labour  problem  is  coming  to   the\r\n\r\nforefront because of the Federation of Unions having  a\r\n\r\ndesire  to  negotiate with the Ministry of Health.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is not just one of staff but is also  one  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   relations.  Furthermore,  there   is   the\r\n\r\ntechnical aspect of the problem. Some people simply  do\r\n\r\nnot care much about the situation. They just dump their\r\n\r\nempty  tins  around. So the first step now is  for  the\r\n\r\nMembers  concerned to start their own campaigns  within\r\n\r\ntheir  own constituencies - the campaigns to  clean  up\r\n\r\ntheir  own  constituencies  and  to  get  rid  of   the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  In serious cases, I think,  if  notice  is\r\n\r\ngiven, I believe the Ministry of Health will take steps\r\n\r\nto have some kind of regional control of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  want  to  know is whether  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  going  to  take  steps  to  destroy  the\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.

Fifty-seven  of  the\r\n\r\nfatal accidents were accounted for by heart failure  (9\r\n\r\ncases),  drowning  (9  cases), explosions  (13  cases),\r\n\r\nfalls of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons (14 cases), and collisions (12 cases).

In another 107  cases,\r\n\r\nit was from 6 per cent to 20 per cent. In the remaining\r\n\r\n31 cases, disablement was about 21 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigations into the causes of accidents in\r\n\r\nfactories have revealed that most of them were  due  to\r\n\r\nfaulty  operation of machinery, ignorance  or  lack  of\r\n\r\ntraining  of the workmen, lack of coordination  between\r\n\r\nworkers,  carelessness  or negligence  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nconcerned,   absence  of  safety  devices   or   safety\r\n\r\nappliances,   and   poor  maintenance   of   industrial\r\n\r\nequipment.  Minimum standards of safety and  health  in\r\n\r\nfactories  are  laid  down in the  Factories  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  is enforced by my Ministry. During the last  ten\r\n\r\nmonths,  factory inspectors made 6,246  inspections  of\r\n\r\nfactories.  It has been found that enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  alone  is  not  sufficient for the  prevention  of\r\n\r\naccidents.  It is necessary to educate the workers,  to\r\n\r\narouse  their safety consciousness, and also to improve\r\n\r\nsupervision of work by management. In order to do this,\r\n\r\na  number  of measures have been taken. Safety  posters\r\n\r\nhave  been  printed and distributed  to  factories  for\r\n\r\nprominent  display,  and safety pamphlets  are  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse   of  preparation.  The  managements  of  bigger\r\n\r\nfactories   have  been  persuaded  to  set  up   safety\r\n\r\ncommittees  in  their factories to promote  the  safety\r\n\r\nconsciousness of their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial Safety Branch has been established\r\n\r\nunder the National Safety First Council with the aim of\r\n\r\npreventing accidents in industrial establishments.

Our manufacturers have now overcome\r\n\r\nthis  psychological  barrier.  Industrial  output   and\r\n\r\nemployment    increased    substantially.

Gross domestic\r\n\r\nproduct  in  1965 increased by $206 million  to  $3,017\r\n\r\nmillion, representing a rate of growth of 7.3 per  cent\r\n\r\nover 1964. This compares very favourably with 1964 when\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  growth was only 2 per  cent.  Even  more\r\n\r\ngratifying  is  the  fact  that  in  spite  of   sudden\r\n\r\npolitical developments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  last  six years, Singapore has  been  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve a consistently high rate of growth. The average\r\n\r\nannual  rate  of  increase in  gross  domestic  product\r\n\r\nduring the period 1960 to 1965 is 8.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of great importance to the economy is the rate of\r\n\r\ngross   capital   formation. In  1965  gross   capital\r\n\r\nformation increased by $49.1 million to $463.8 million,\r\n\r\nreflecting an increase of 11.8 per cent over 1964.  It,\r\n\r\ntherefore, accounts for about 15 per cent of the  gross\r\n\r\ndomestic  product. Though creditable, this  performance\r\n\r\nfalls short of the 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent rate of\r\n\r\ncapital accumulation, which is considered necessary for\r\n\r\nself-sustaining growth in developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Reserves</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official external reserves of the Government and\r\n\r\nstatutory   authorities  have  increased   by   $123.3\r\n\r\nmillion  this  year,  compared with  the  position  in 1965.  \r\n\r\nOfficial  reserves now  total  $1,038  million,\r\n\r\ncompared  with $914.7 million in September last  year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made up as follows:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                              1966        1965\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                   Government reserves      554.31       484.7\r\n\r\n                   Statutory authorities    183.69       153.6\r\n\r\n                                            783.00       638.3\r\n\r\n                                           \r\n\r\n                   Add estimate of          300.00       276.4\r\n\r\n                   currency reserves\r\n\r\n                                          --------       -----\r\n\r\n                               Total      1,038.00       914.7\r\n\r\n                                          ========       =====            \r\n\r\n</pre>                  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Our official reserves would probably be more, depending\r\n\r\non  the  amount of currency redeemed in Singapore  next\r\n\r\nyear.

In  the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this year, imports were valued at  $3,017.9\r\n\r\nmillion, which is an increase of 6.3 per cent over  the\r\n\r\nsame  period  in 1965. Similarly, exports  expanded  to\r\n\r\n$2,494.6  million, an increase of 13.3  per  cent  over\r\n\r\nlast year. Total external trade by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  third quarter of this year has therefore shown  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  9.36 per cent. Projected  over  the  full\r\n\r\nyear,  total  trade  may  well exceed  $7,200  million.\r\n\r\nThough this would be still below the peak years of 1962\r\n\r\nand  1963, prospects for improvement are good,  bearing\r\n\r\nin  mind  the  resumption of trade with  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  direct trading  relations  with  the\r\n\r\nSoviet Union and East European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the composition of Singapore's\r\n\r\ngrowing external trade shows even more significant  and\r\n\r\nencouraging   trends.   Domestic   exports,   excluding\r\n\r\npetroleum products in 1965, increased by $48.9  million\r\n\r\nto  $345.8 million. This represents an increase of 16.4\r\n\r\nper  cent  over 1964. It forms 11.5 per cent  of  total\r\n\r\nexports  compared  to 10.7 per cent in  1964.  A  large\r\n\r\nproportion  of  the increase in domestic exports  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  local industries. For instance, exports of  wheat\r\n\r\nflour  in 1965 showed an increase of 125 per cent  over\r\n\r\n1964.  Similarly,  exports of steel  bars  and  plywood\r\n\r\nrecorded  increases of 140 per cent and  197  per  cent\r\n\r\nrespectively over the previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imports of goods purely for re-export is declining in\r\n\r\nimportance. In 1964 re-exports of goods imported formed\r\n\r\n37.9 per cent of total exports. In 1965 it fell to 36.2\r\n\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that with industrialisation, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  either  process  goods  it  imports  before   re-exporting  them, or use them as raw materials  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture  of new products, which are then  exported.\r\n\r\nRetained  imports  will  therefore  increase  with  the\r\n\r\nyears.  In  1965 retained imports increased  by  $190.5\r\n\r\nmillion  to $1,809 million. But what is significant  is\r\n\r\nthe  fact that an increasing amount of imports retained\r\n\r\nis  in  the  form  of either raw materials  or  capital\r\n\r\nequipment required by new industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing volume of external trade has resulted in\r\n\r\nhigher  earnings for Singapore also. In  1965  earnings\r\n\r\nfrom  trade was estimated at $396.2 million,  or  $44.5\r\n\r\nmillion  over earnings in 1964, which stood  at  $351.7\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building and Construction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of buildings commenced in the first six\r\n\r\nmonths  of this year stood at $56.5 million as  against\r\n\r\n$80.7  million  for the same period last year.  Private\r\n\r\ndevelopment  fell  from  $42 million  in  1965  to  $28\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1966  for the same period - a  fall  of  $14\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in property is less attractive than\r\n\r\ninvestment in other fields. I will outline later on the\r\n\r\nsteps  we  are taking to make investments in properties\r\n\r\nin   urban  and  designated  areas  a  more  attractive\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transportation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial growth and expanding trade is shown by the\r\n\r\nincreasing volume of shipping and cargo handled through\r\n\r\nour  port. The number and tonnage of ships entering and\r\n\r\nleaving  the  port of Singapore in 1965  surpassed  all\r\n\r\nprevious  records with an impressive figure  of  21,862\r\n\r\nvessels  of 90 million net registered tons. Performance\r\n\r\nthis year is likely to be even higher as there has been\r\n\r\na rapid increase in shipping movements during the first\r\n\r\nnine months of the year. Cargo passing through the port\r\n\r\nlast year totalled 21.3 million tons, or an increase of\r\n\r\n18.2  per  cent over 1964. Performance this year  shows\r\n\r\nthat  cargo handled will reach 24 million tons in 1966.\r\n\r\nIncrease in cargo handled is due to Singapore's growing\r\n\r\nimportance   as   a  centre  for  petroleum   refining.\r\n\r\nDischarge  of  industrial raw materials  such  as  bulk\r\n\r\nwheat  and  cement  clinker  is  also  rising  rapidly,\r\n\r\ntestimony to Singapore's changing industrial structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Finance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well being of an economy can also be tested by an\r\n\r\nexamination of its financial bedrock, namely,  deposits\r\n\r\nin the banks and advances made by them during the year.\r\n\r\nAs  at  the  end  of September this year,  deposits  of\r\n\r\ncustomers  other than banks totalled $1,337.2  million.\r\n\r\nThis is $115.2 million more than the amount of deposits\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of December 1965 and $172.9 million  more\r\n\r\nthan  deposits held at the end of September last  year.\r\n\r\nIncreases  in  bank  deposits this year  are  therefore\r\n\r\nbetter than increases in previous years, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naveraged $82.3 million annually between 1961 and  1965.\r\n\r\nLoans  and advances of banks show the level of economic\r\n\r\nactivity generated. At the end of September this  year,\r\n\r\nloans  and advances to customers other than banks total\r\n\r\n$995  million, or an increase of $81 million  over  the\r\n\r\namount lent at the end of December 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control of Finance Companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late, the activities of certain finance companies\r\n\r\nhave  given  rise to some concern, and I  feel  that  a\r\n\r\npublic  warning  would be timely. Very simply,  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  receive deposits from the public on  payment\r\n\r\nof  interest and re-lend this money to finance, usually\r\n\r\non  hire-purchase, the sale of goods  like  motor-cars,\r\n\r\nmotor-scooters, radios, refrigerators and so on.  In  a\r\n\r\nsense  they operate like a bank, but unlike  banks  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  finance companies are not  governed  by\r\n\r\nlaw.  Recently,  there  has been  a  spate  of  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  advertising  for deposits  from  the  public\r\n\r\noffering  to  pay  rather high rates  of  interest.  It\r\n\r\nfollows  that in turn these finance companies must  re-lend  at even higher rates of interest in order to make\r\n\r\na profit. To do so, some of them may be tempted to take\r\n\r\nundue  risks in their lending and thereby endanger  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the deposits made by the public. There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  wrong  if a reputable finance company  accepts\r\n\r\ndeposits from the public and in turn re-lends  if  care\r\n\r\nis taken to ensure that the purpose for which the money\r\n\r\nis  re-lent  is  sound and there is reasonable  credit-worthiness to warrant such lending. It is only when the\r\n\r\nfinance   companies   become   reckless   and    accept\r\n\r\nunjustifiable  risks  without  regard  to  proper   and\r\n\r\nadequate securities, that the monies deposited  by  the\r\n\r\npublic are exposed to danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will shortly introduce legislation to\r\n\r\nregulate   and  control  the  operations   of   finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  in order to safeguard the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic who deposit funds with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Expansion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial census of 1965 shows that output by\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased  by  16.6  per cent from  $927.9  million  to\r\n\r\n$1,082.1  million. Employment in these industries  rose\r\n\r\nby  13.8 per cent from 41,488 to 47,217. Value added in\r\n\r\n1965  was  $319.6 million compared with $282.5 million,\r\n\r\nor a rise of 13.1 per cent. Wages also rose accordingly\r\n\r\nfrom $111 million in 1964 to $132 million in 1965. This\r\n\r\nis  an  increase  of  18.9 per cent.  The  increase  in\r\n\r\noutput,  value added, employment and wages is due  both\r\n\r\nto  establishment of new industries, as well as  rising\r\n\r\nproduction of firms already established. Output  of  an\r\n\r\nestablished group of 882 manufacturing firms  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $918.9 million to $1,034.6 million, or  12.6  per\r\n\r\ncent in 1965 over 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation remains the backbone of our\r\n\r\neconomic  development. During the two years in Malaysia\r\n\r\nno  Pioneer Certificates were issued in Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nsince   August  last  year  we  have  issued   58   new\r\n\r\ncertificates;  in addition, some 25 more projects  were\r\n\r\napproved  in  principle. Today, there are  165  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustrial  firms compared with 113  in  1964.  107  of\r\n\r\nthese  are already in production while 33 projects  are\r\n\r\nin various stages of implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September 1966, the total investment of these\r\n\r\npioneer  firms in fixed assets had grown to  more  than\r\n\r\n$300 million from $255 million at the end of 1965.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  value  of output of these firms is  expected  to\r\n\r\nreach  $450 million this year, as against $318  million\r\n\r\nin  1965.  In terms of employment, the total number  of\r\n\r\nworkers  in pioneer firms has grown from 5,000  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of 1964 to 12,000 today. For the industrial sector\r\n\r\nas  a  whole, the production of all industrial firms  -\r\n\r\npioneer and non-pioneer - in the Republic has risen  by\r\n\r\nnearly 20 per cent during the past 12 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of the industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programme is that our exports of  domestic\r\n\r\nproducts  have  been  increasing  steadily.  As   noted\r\n\r\nearlier,  in  1965,  $345.8 million worth  of  domestic\r\n\r\nproducts were exported. This is expected to reach  some\r\n\r\n$450  million this year. Another significant aspect  of\r\n\r\nour programme is that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave succeeded in broadening our industrial base. There\r\n\r\nis   today  a  wide  range  of  industrial  enterprises\r\n\r\nscattered  all over the Republic which are  capable  of\r\n\r\nexpansion.   This   includes  the  expansion   of   oil\r\n\r\nrefineries into a petro-chemical complex, the expansion\r\n\r\nof  general ship-repairing and building facilities  for\r\n\r\nconstruction of specialised vessels, construction of  a\r\n\r\nfisheries  harbour  as part of an integrated  plan  for\r\n\r\ndeveloping a deep-sea fishing and canning industry, the\r\n\r\nproduction of parts and components for motor  vehicles,\r\n\r\nelectronics  and other engineering assembly industries,\r\n\r\nthe development of an integrated feedmill and vegetable\r\n\r\noil  complex  around  the grain  silo  enterprise,  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  caustic soda and chlorine production  to\r\n\r\np.v.c. and  other  chemicals, the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nmodern paper mill for supporting various paper products\r\n\r\nindustries, the expansion of garments manufacturing  to\r\n\r\nintegrated  textile  mills,  and  the  development   of\r\n\r\nintegrated  timber projects to make use of  waste  from\r\n\r\nsaw-milling and plywood factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the infrastructure for expansion,\r\n\r\ncontinuing efforts are being directed to developing new\r\n\r\nindustrial  land  and factory buildings.  Prepared  new\r\n\r\nland  for industry at the Jurong Industrial Estate  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  to  2,843 acres in September  this  year,  as\r\n\r\ncompared with some 2,443 acres at the end of 1965.  The\r\n\r\ncountry's   first  flatted  factory  at  Tanglin   Halt\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Estate was fully occupied immediately  upon\r\n\r\ncompletion. More will be built. Prepared sites  in  the\r\n\r\nKallang Park Marine Industry Zone and the Kranji Timber\r\n\r\nIndustry Estate are also in great demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>NEW FISCAL INCENTIVES</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the economy in 1965 and the current\r\n\r\nyear shows that it is moving forward. By all criteria -\r\n\r\nexternal trade, domestic exports, industrial production\r\n\r\nand  savings - Singapore has an expanding economy.  The\r\n\r\nchallenge  really is whether the Singapore economy  can\r\n\r\ngrow  fast  enough  to  solve its fundamental  problem,\r\n\r\nnamely, generation of employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period 1961-1965, employment opportunities\r\n\r\nincreased by 57,600 jobs, or an average of 11,520  jobs\r\n\r\na  year. This fell short of the 70,000 additional  jobs\r\n\r\nneeded.  This  shortfall of 12,400 jobs, added  to  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people already unemployed at the beginning of\r\n\r\n1961, raised the number of unemployed to 56,300 at  the\r\n\r\nend of 1965. This level of unemployment constitutes  10\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the total economically active population.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of unemployment is therefore high. Unless\r\n\r\nwe  can  during  the  coming  five  years  reduce  this\r\n\r\nspectre,  then all the economic gains will be  lost  in\r\n\r\nthe  turmoil of social and political unrest.  Over  the\r\n\r\nnext five years from 1966 to 1970, Singapore would need\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  wipe  off the backlog  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nunemployed,  but also provide another 95,000  jobs  for\r\n\r\nour  youths,  who would be leaving schools and  seeking\r\n\r\nentry into the labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to this employment problem lies in a\r\n\r\ncrash   programme  for  the  development   of   export-orientated industries. As in the case of all  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  strive  for  industrial  development,  we   have\r\n\r\ninitially only a limited number of industries  directed\r\n\r\nentirely  towards exports. The majority of our existing\r\n\r\nindustries  still  depend to  a  great  extent  on  the\r\n\r\ndomestic market. This is inevitable in the early stages\r\n\r\nof  our industrial development. We must now move  to  a\r\n\r\nnew  phase  of  the industrial programme,  namely,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of export-orientated industries.  In  order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  early full employment and to ensure  long-term  economic stability and growth, we need  specially\r\n\r\nto  encourage  manufacturers with established  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets and which can draw their raw material supply on\r\n\r\na world-wide basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After independence, we began to work in this\r\n\r\ndirection.  I  am  glad  to report  that  we  have  now\r\n\r\ncompleted the necessary administrative arrangements for\r\n\r\nsuch  a crash programme. This programme calls for three\r\n\r\nmajor areas of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development Training</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the development of human resources remains\r\n\r\nour  most  valuable asset. It is only in  recent  years\r\n\r\nthat  we  began to gear our educational system  towards\r\n\r\nproviding  skills needed for an industrial society.  In\r\n\r\norder to achieve rapid technological advancement and to\r\n\r\ndevelop  to  the  full  the potential  quality  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers,  it  will  be necessary  to  organise  a  mass\r\n\r\nprogramme of training within industries for specialised\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has already started,\r\n\r\non  a  limited  scale, the training of technicians  and\r\n\r\nskilled workers in tool and die-making, electro-plating\r\n\r\nand heat treatment. The specialised training programmes\r\n\r\nhelp  to  upgrade  the  skill of  our  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  industries and, what is  more  important,  to\r\n\r\nimpart  new specialised skills and knowledge to  school\r\n\r\nleavers  to prepare them for new and more sophisticated\r\n\r\nindustries.  A  Metal Industry Development  Centre  and\r\n\r\nPrototype  Production and Training Centre for machinery\r\n\r\nbuilding, electronics, precision instruments,  printing\r\n\r\nand  plastic  will  be set up. These  centres  will  be\r\n\r\noperated  in  close  co-operation  with  industry.   In\r\n\r\naddition,   specialised  production  teams,   including\r\n\r\nworkers, will be sent overseas for on-the-job training.\r\n\r\nEach  of  such  schemes  will be directed  towards  the\r\n\r\ncreation of specific factories. By building up a  large\r\n\r\nreservoir  of technicians and skilled workers,  and  by\r\n\r\ngearing training to the industrial promotion programme,\r\n\r\nwe can quickly enter into a more sophisticated stage of\r\n\r\nindustrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>National Productivity Drive</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of action lies in re-doubling our\r\n\r\nefforts  towards  high  quality  and  lower  production\r\n\r\ncosts.  This  is  because the international  market  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  increasingly  competitive.  Young  industries\r\n\r\ntake  time  to  mature and yet meet fierce  competition\r\n\r\nfrom the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the co-operation of the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress, the Singapore Manufacturers' Association  and\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Employers' Federation, we jointly drew up\r\n\r\nin 1965 a Charter for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Progress. It is recognised by  all  parties\r\n\r\nthat  high productivity brings better wages and working\r\n\r\nconditions, lower prices for consumers at home,  and  a\r\n\r\nwider  market abroad and, finally, adequate  investment\r\n\r\nreturns, continuing expansion of production capacities,\r\n\r\nand  full  employment. To translate this  basic  policy\r\n\r\ninto   concrete  action,  practical  steps  have   been\r\n\r\ninitiated. The Singapore Productivity Centre,  under  a\r\n\r\nGoverning  Council with representation of  all  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned,  will come into operation in  January  1967.\r\n\r\nThe Centre will be entrusted with the responsibility of\r\n\r\nlaunching  a  national  movement  directed  to  further\r\n\r\nlabour-management  co-operation,  and  to  improve  the\r\n\r\noperational  efficiency  of  every  enterprise  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Export and Investment Incentives</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third area of action. Clearly, the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of our development training programme and  the\r\n\r\nnational productivity drive depends ultimately  on  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing  expansion  of our  exports  and  the  rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our  industrial  sector.  To  achieve  both\r\n\r\nobjectives in the shortest possible time, we need  many\r\n\r\nmore  entrepreneurs, much more managerial  capabilities\r\n\r\nand  technical  knowledge,  and  especially  much  more\r\n\r\ninternational  marketing \"know-how\". We have  therefore\r\n\r\nto attract the types of export industries which buy raw\r\n\r\nmaterials and sell their products on a world-wide basis\r\n\r\nand  which can make full use of the high quality of our\r\n\r\nlabour  force, our geographic advantages, and efficient\r\n\r\ninfrastructures.  International manufacturers  of  this\r\n\r\ntype  have more or less free choice in selecting  their\r\n\r\nplant  location. Singapore, therefore, has  to  compete\r\n\r\nwith other countries in all parts of the world for such\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that our fiscal incentives must be as\r\n\r\nattractive as, if not more than, those offered by other\r\n\r\ncountries.  To all industries, pioneer or  non-pioneer,\r\n\r\nwhich are prepared to play an active role in our export-orientated   programme   and   to   make   a   positive\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  this  new  phase  of  our  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  the  Government will grant,  with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  1st  January, 1967, the necessary incentives  for\r\n\r\nexport and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestment,  for  expansion as well as for  encouraging\r\n\r\nrapid   technological  advancement.  This   means   the\r\n\r\nincentives will apply to export profits earned in 1967,\r\n\r\nand  will generally be taken into account for the  year\r\n\r\nof assessment 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, for export and investment, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will   grant  approved   enterprises   the\r\n\r\nfollowing incentives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First: Tax on interest earned by non-residents from\r\n\r\ndeposits held in an external account in a bank  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be reduced from 40 per cent  to  10\r\n\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second: Interest paid from Singapore sources and\r\n\r\nreceived  by  persons or enterprises  overseas  is\r\n\r\ngenerally   liable  to  tax  in  Singapore.   Such\r\n\r\npayments  made  on  approved  loans  advanced   to\r\n\r\napproved enterprises in Singapore for the purchase\r\n\r\nof  capital equipment from abroad will be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third: Profit on export of manufactured goods for\r\n\r\nboth existing and new manufacturing industries and\r\n\r\ndeep-sea fisheries, but excluding processing, will\r\n\r\nbe  taxed  at the equivalent of one-tenth  of  the\r\n\r\nnormal company tax rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concessionary rate (4 per cent) applies to all\r\n\r\nlimited   liability  companies  where   the   profits\r\n\r\nderived  from  export are at least  20  per  cent  of\r\n\r\ntheir   total  profits,  and  export  sales  (f.o.b.)\r\n\r\namount   to   not  less  than  $100,000   per   year.\r\n\r\nQualifying firms with pioneer status will be  granted\r\n\r\nthis  concessionary  rate for a period  of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  10  years  from  the date of  expiry  of  their\r\n\r\npioneer   status.   The  concessionary   period   for\r\n\r\nqualifying  non-pioneer firms will be not  less  than  15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern industries cannot afford to stand still. They\r\n\r\nmust  be encouraged to expand their productive capacity\r\n\r\nin  order  to  achieve  high volume  and  low  cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction,  thus enabling them to compete successfully\r\n\r\nin the international market. For existing industries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  expand, the Government will offer the  following\r\n\r\nincentives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of plant expansion through the increase\r\n\r\nof  funds  by  an  approved enterprise,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ngranted  tax  exemption, from the date on  which  the\r\n\r\nnewly  added equipment thereof starts to  operate  or\r\n\r\nto   render  services,  in  respect  of  the   income\r\n\r\nincreased as a result of such expansion, on  a  basis\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  that  applicable to pioneer  industries,\r\n\r\nprovided that at the time of closing of accounts  for\r\n\r\nthe  year the expansion has resulted in a 30 per cent\r\n\r\nor  more increase in its productive capacity over the\r\n\r\nappropriate  existing capacity  applicable  prior  to\r\n\r\nsuch plant expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated by the Government that the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  many  modern sophisticated  industries\r\n\r\nsuch  as  petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics\r\n\r\nand  specialised  branches  of  engineering  industries\r\n\r\nincur  high initial investments in research  and  pilot\r\n\r\nplants  or  in specially designed tools and  equipment,\r\n\r\nwhich  become obsolete in a comparatively short period.\r\n\r\nIn   order  to  seek  continuing  advancement  of   the\r\n\r\ntechnological level of our industries and to  speed  up\r\n\r\nthe  process of development, the Government  will  give\r\n\r\nthe following encouragement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax on royalties, licences and technical assistance\r\n\r\nfees,  and  approved  contributions  to  develop  and\r\n\r\nresearch   costs   payable   overseas   by   approved\r\n\r\nenterprises  may be reduced from 40 per  cent  to  20\r\n\r\nper  cent,  provided that such concession  would  not\r\n\r\nresult  in  transfer  of any  tax  liability  to  the\r\n\r\nresident  countries of the recipients.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may exempt such payments in special  cases\r\n\r\nif  the  national  interest would be thereby  served.\r\n\r\nForeign  recipients  who derive  royalties,  licences\r\n\r\nand  technical  assistance fees  from  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nconvert   such   payments   into   equity   of    the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  firms operating in  Singapore  may  be\r\n\r\nexempted from tax liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Existing Incentives</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these new incentives, we have already\r\n\r\nprovided for powers whereby the Government may  approve\r\n\r\non application special accelerated initial depreciation\r\n\r\nup  to 100 per cent in one year and a three-year write-off  for plant, equipment or machinery utilised in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture  or  processing  of  goods  and  materials.\r\n\r\nBesides,  approved manufacturers are now also  entitled\r\n\r\nto double deduction on expenditure spent on advertising\r\n\r\nor  market development. Investors will, of course, also\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   enjoy  the  benefits  of  pioneer   tax\r\n\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Urban Redevelopment Incentives</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are no doubt aware of our\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  renew and redevelop our city  and  urban\r\n\r\nareas.  Clearance and demolition of the 135-acre Outram\r\n\r\nand   90-acre   Crawford  precincts   are   progressing\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily. Part of these areas will be marked  out\r\n\r\nfor  development  by  the private  sector  and  private\r\n\r\ninvestors may also redevelop other city areas on  their\r\n\r\nown.  Such  development must, however, be  sufficiently\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  to  make full use of  the  land  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  better  traffic  circulation,  pedestrian\r\n\r\nbays,  parking  and  other  facilities.  In  order   to\r\n\r\nstimulate private participation in redevelopment of the\r\n\r\ncity, the Government has decided that with effect  from\r\n\r\nnext  year,  the  rate of property tax  for  properties\r\n\r\nerected  in  areas  designated for urban  redevelopment\r\n\r\nwill  be 12 per cent as against the present rate of  36\r\n\r\nper   cent.   In   addition,  during  the   period   of\r\n\r\nconstruction, there will be a waiver of property tax on\r\n\r\nthe  land for an initial period of six months, plus  an\r\n\r\nadditional month for every storey of the building to be\r\n\r\nerected  on  the  property. For  example,  a  10-storey\r\n\r\nbuilding will receive a waiver of 16 months of property\r\n\r\ntax  on the vacant property while construction is going\r\n\r\non.  Singapore has over the last six years  achieved  a\r\n\r\nunique  position  in the provision of low-cost  housing\r\n\r\nand  it is hoped that the Government's plans for  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  with private participation will achieve  equal\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development Outlook</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private industry to respond fully to the new\r\n\r\nfiscal  incentives, it will be necessary for the entire\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery to have a forward and enlightened\r\n\r\noutlook.  The  administration  must  be  infused   with\r\n\r\nenthusiasm   for   development  and  be   intelligently\r\n\r\nflexible to facilitate it. Experience in many countries\r\n\r\nshows  that  unnecessary  rigidity,  officiousness  and\r\n\r\ndelays  will  nullify  the effects  of  incentives  and\r\n\r\nfrustrate promotional efforts. What we want are results\r\n\r\n- not red tape. We are giving high priority to a review\r\n\r\nand    examination   of   existing    Ordinances    and\r\n\r\nadministrative  rules  for  their  relevance   to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  effort.  We must  ensure  that  those  who\r\n\r\nrespond  receive full co-operation and support  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels and sectors of the Government complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>General Review of Revenue and Expenditure in 1966</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to a review of revenue and expenditure in\r\n\r\n1966.  It  was estimated that the budget for 1966  will\r\n\r\nyield  a  small balance of approximately half a million\r\n\r\ndollars.  The  objective was a balanced budget  without\r\n\r\nhaving  to  run down reserves. I am pleased  to  report\r\n\r\nthat  from  performance  up to  now,  the  position  is\r\n\r\nexpected   to   be  slightly  better  than   originally\r\n\r\nestimated and it is likely that we shall close the year\r\n\r\nwith a balance of about $5.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue receipts for the year are likely to come out\r\n\r\nat  $537.3  million. A sum of $401.3 million  has  been\r\n\r\ncollected by the end of September. The balance of  $136\r\n\r\nmillion is expected to be collected in the last quarter\r\n\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure up to the end of September came to $354.5\r\n\r\nmillion, including a sum of $23.3 million paid  to  the\r\n\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and a sum of $1 million  to\r\n\r\nthe    World   Bank,   being   Singapore's   membership\r\n\r\nsubscription to these two world bodies. Expenditure for\r\n\r\nthe last three months of the year is estimated at about\r\n\r\n$177.1   million  inclusive  of  a  transfer   to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund of $30 million. Total expenditure  for\r\n\r\nthe year should then come out at $531.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a total revenue of $537.3 million and a total\r\n\r\nexpenditure of $531.6 million, the surplus will  amount\r\n\r\nto  $5.7  million;  in other words,  about  $5  million\r\n\r\nbetter than anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue 1966</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue for 1966 is as estimated, with short-falls from some heads compensated by increases in\r\n\r\nothers.  Revenue  from customs duties  on  liquor  will\r\n\r\nprobably be $0.8 million less than anticipated, due  to\r\n\r\na fall in consumption of imported malt liquors. Revenue\r\n\r\nfrom  imported petroleum products will be $25.5 million\r\n\r\nless  than estimated, but this will be more than offset\r\n\r\nby  an  increase  in  revenue from petroleum  products,\r\n\r\nlocally  refined,  amounting to $33.2 million.

Receipts from tobacco  duty\r\n\r\nare  likely to yield $2.7 million more, due to  greater\r\n\r\nuse   of   dutiable  raw  tobacco  in  local  cigarette\r\n\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor Vehicle Ad Valorem Registration Fees and Road\r\n\r\nTax are expected to exceed the estimate by $1.6 million\r\n\r\nand  $0.6  million respectively.

Provision for this Head was found to  be\r\n\r\ninadequate, i.e. \"Public Works Recurrent\". This was  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  the  large number of Government  buildings\r\n\r\nwhich  had to be renovated during the year. During  the\r\n\r\nperiod  under Malaysia, practically no maintenance  was\r\n\r\ncarried   out  on  the  buildings  which  were  Federal\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. This resulted in a larger than normal\r\n\r\nnumber  of  buildings requiring urgent maintenance  and\r\n\r\nrepairs. The other Heads of Expenditure are expected to\r\n\r\nkeep within the provisions voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of supplementary estimates of $8.4\r\n\r\nmillion, total estimated expenditure for the year would\r\n\r\nnow  be  $545 million. However, in view of  savings  in\r\n\r\ncertain departments, actual expenditure for the year is\r\n\r\nexpected  to be in the region of $531.6 million,  which\r\n\r\nis  $5  million  less than the sum  of  $536.6  million\r\n\r\nprovided in the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of Development Expenditure in 1966</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for development expenditure for 1966, the public\r\n\r\nsector development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprises  projects undertaken directly  by  Government\r\n\r\nministries and departments as well as schemes which are\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the various statutory authorities.  The\r\n\r\ntentative public sector allocation for 1966 was  $430.5\r\n\r\nmillion, made up of $149.6 million proposed expenditure\r\n\r\nby  Government ministries and departments,  and  $280.9\r\n\r\nmillion  to  be  spent  by  the statutory  authorities.\r\n\r\nAllocation  for Government ministries was  subsequently\r\n\r\nincreased by a supplementary estimate of $27.2 million,\r\n\r\nto  make  a  total of $176.8 million. Based  on  actual\r\n\r\nperformance  up  to date this year, it is  likely  that\r\n\r\npublic sector expenditure for the full year will  reach\r\n\r\n$284  million.  Compared  with  actual  expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$250.6 million in 1965, this represents an increase  of\r\n\r\n13.3 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure by Government ministries will amount to\r\n\r\n$113  million as compared with $67.2 million  spent  in\r\n\r\n1965, reflecting an increase of 68.2 per cent. However,\r\n\r\nnearly  $20  million  of  1966 expenditure  arose  from\r\n\r\npayments for the SEACOM project as well as purchase  of\r\n\r\nthe  assets  of Cable & Wireless Ltd. Land  reclamation\r\n\r\nand   urban   re-development  have  also  shown   rapid\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure by the statutory authorities is estimated\r\n\r\nto  amount to $171 million, which is about 6.6 per cent\r\n\r\nless than the $183.1 million spent in 1965. The fall in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  here is due mainly to a reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the Economic Development Board,  largely\r\n\r\nbecause  the major portion of the costly infrastructure\r\n\r\ndevelopment  has  been completed.  Expenditure  by  the\r\n\r\nother authorities was about 10 per cent higher in  1966\r\n\r\ncompared to 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sectoral development is likely to be: economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment   $191  million;  social  development   $79\r\n\r\nmillion; public administration and defence $14 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ordinary Estimates 1967</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial outlook for 1967 continues to be fair.\r\n\r\nTotal  revenue is estimated at $590.5 million and total\r\n\r\nexpenditure at $590.2 million, including a transfer  of\r\n\r\n$30 million to the Development Fund. This gives a small\r\n\r\nsurplus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  $0.3  million. The estimated expenditure of  $590.2\r\n\r\nmillion  for  1967  is higher than the  sum  of  $531.6\r\n\r\nmillion  expected  to  be  spent  this  year  by  $58.6\r\n\r\nmillion.  Fortunately, this increase is  matched  by  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding rise in estimated revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue of $590.5 million is $53.2\r\n\r\nmillion  higher  than  the revenue  of  $537.3  million\r\n\r\nexpected  to be collected for 1966. Thus, in  spite  of\r\n\r\nthe rather steep rise in expenditure, it is possible to\r\n\r\nhave a balanced budget for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest increase in estimated expenditure is, as\r\n\r\nalways,  in  respect of the Ministry of Education.  For\r\n\r\n1967,  expenditure for Education is estimated at $143.7\r\n\r\nmillion,  which is $14.5 million more than the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$129.2  million provided for this year. The main reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  increase  is because of  the  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. This is required to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nlarge number of students taken into the primary schools\r\n\r\nduring  the past few years and who would now move  into\r\n\r\nsecondary level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next highest rise is in respect of servicing the\r\n\r\nPublic Debt. This is a statutory expenditure and  shows\r\n\r\nan  increase  of $11.2 million. With more  loans  being\r\n\r\nfloated with the years to finance development, the rise\r\n\r\nin this expenditure is expected to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal expansion of our Police and Defence Forces\r\n\r\nresults  in  a  rise  of estimated expenditure  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Interior and Defence by $4.9  million.\r\n\r\nThe  establishment of missions abroad in  keeping  with\r\n\r\nour  new independent status is expected to result in  a\r\n\r\nrise of $1.4 million in the expenditure of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Foreign  Affairs. In addition, a  provision  of  $5\r\n\r\nmillion has been included under the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nhead  of  expenditure  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring\r\n\r\nproperty  abroad  for our foreign  missions,  and  $1.0\r\n\r\nmillion   under   the  Contributions   and   Charitable\r\n\r\nAllowances  head  of expenditure for  contributions  to\r\n\r\ninternational organisations. For reasons which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, the estimates for the Telecoms Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  1967 show an increase of $6 million, This increase\r\n\r\nwas covered by supplementary estimates in 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates for the Postal Department show a rise\r\n\r\nof $2.2 million. Of this, $1.5 million is on account of\r\n\r\na  change  in  book-keeping  procedure  to  conform  to\r\n\r\nFinancial Regulations in respect of the mail conveyance\r\n\r\nvote. Hitherto, receipts were credited to revenue  only\r\n\r\nafter  deduction of expenditure. This has been  changed\r\n\r\nto paying in gross receipts and meeting the expenditure\r\n\r\ninvolved  from an expenditure vote. The net  result  is\r\n\r\nthe  same  as  both  revenue and  expenditure  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased  by  the  same amount. The  balance  of  $0.7\r\n\r\nmillion  of  estimated increase in the  expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthis Department is due mainly to the separation of  the\r\n\r\nPostal Department from the Malaysian Postal Department.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of the separation, the Postal  Department\r\n\r\nwill  have to set up new sections to deal with  certain\r\n\r\nfunctions previously discharged by the headquarters  at\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of expenditure \"Public Works Recurrent\"\r\n\r\nshows  an increase of $1.4 million. This is mainly  due\r\n\r\nto  the increase in the number of roads which leads  to\r\n\r\nan  increase in expenditure on their maintenance and on\r\n\r\npublic street lighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases I have mentioned make up a total of\r\n\r\n$47.6 million. The balance of $6 million is made up  of\r\n\r\nsmall  increases of the other heads of  expenditure  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  normal expansion, such  as  about  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollar increase for the Hospital Division  and\r\n\r\n$400,000 for Parks and Recreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue 1967</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from most of the major taxes are expected to\r\n\r\nincrease next year in the normal manner, resulting in a\r\n\r\ntotal collection of $590.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income Tax is expected to yield $114.0 million.\r\n\r\nExcise  and Entertainment Duties are expected to  yield\r\n\r\n$73.6 million.

During the course of the year a review has been made of miscellaneous licence fees and fees for services\r\n\r\nwhich have remained unchanged for periods varying  from\r\n\r\n10  to  30  years,  and this is expected  to  yield  an\r\n\r\nadditional $2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable & Wireless Ltd, was acquired by Government in\r\n\r\n1966   and  the  revenue  from  the  telecommunications\r\n\r\n(External)  Service, and this new item  of  revenue  is\r\n\r\nexpected to yield $8.9 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's share of Currency Profits will amount to\r\n\r\n$12 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Basis for Road Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licence fees on motor vehicles have hitherto been\r\n\r\ncollected  on  the horsepower rating of  the  vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis is an obsolete method of taxing motor vehicles for\r\n\r\nuse  on  roads.  It is now proposed to change  this  to\r\n\r\nfollow  international  practice  by  prescribing   fees\r\n\r\naccording to the cubic centimeter cylinder capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle.  The new Road Tax will be  10  cents  per\r\n\r\ncubic  centimeter. The revised fee is expected to yield\r\n\r\nan  increase of $5.5 million. Care, however, has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  minimise the incidence of  the  tax  on  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport sector. This is done by reducing  the\r\n\r\nseating fee of $5 per passenger per month to $3.50  for\r\n\r\nlicensed  taxis  and $4.20 for buses.

For this reason, expenditure  on\r\n\r\nurban re-development in 1967 will be $15 million, which\r\n\r\nis more than twice the amount spent this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has two other\r\n\r\nlarge  projects in hand for 1967.

As the Sweep was only launched\r\n\r\nin  October this year, it may not be possible to derive\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds  from  the Sweep  to  meet  necessary\r\n\r\npayments  in  1967. For this reason, it is proposed  to\r\n\r\nvote  $3 million in the Estimates for the project  next\r\n\r\nyear  and  to  recover it from the Sweep in  subsequent\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department will have a development\r\n\r\nbudget of $34.8 million in 1967, which is about a third\r\n\r\nhigher than the department's actual expenditure of  $26\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1966. For roads and bridges a sum  of  $9.0\r\n\r\nmillion   will  be  spent,  for  drainage   and   flood\r\n\r\nalleviation $3.1 million, and for sewerage  works  $9.3\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although substantial investments have gone into the\r\n\r\nopening  up  of new roads, the widening and improvement\r\n\r\nof  existing  roads  into dual  carriageways,  and  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of one-way traffic systems, the problem of\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion,  especially  in  the  city,  still\r\n\r\nremains. This is evident from the frequent traffic jams\r\n\r\nalong main roads leading into the city.

This, together  with\r\n\r\nthe loan of $85 million to the statutory authorities, a\r\n\r\nloan  of  $3  million  to  the Government  Co-operative\r\n\r\nHousing  Society,  and a transfer  of  $10  million  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  Contingency Fund, give  a  total  of  $249.3\r\n\r\nmillion to be provided for on Government account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Resources for the Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the 1967 Estimates total $249.3 million, the\r\n\r\nanticipated expenditure is estimated at $211.4 million,\r\n\r\nor  about 85 per cent of the total provision.  We  will\r\n\r\nnow examine the position of the Development Fund, which\r\n\r\nis   the  source  of  finance  for  the  Estimates,  to\r\n\r\ndetermine   how   it   will   meet   this   anticipated\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of the Development Fund at 31st December,\r\n\r\n1965, was $179.7 million, while the inflow to the  Fund\r\n\r\nthis  year  (1966)  is expected to be  $171.3  million,\r\n\r\ngiving a total of $351 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure from the Fund this year is now\r\n\r\nestimated  at  $212.9  million, which  means  that  the\r\n\r\nbalance in the Development Fund at 31st December, 1966,\r\n\r\nwill be $138.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflow into the Fund in 1967 is 57.0% expected to\r\n\r\nbe  $180.0 million. As the anticipated expenditure from\r\n\r\nthe Fund for 1967 is $211.4 million, the balance in the\r\n\r\nFund  at the end of 1967 will be around $106.7 million.\r\n\r\nThe  Government proposes to obtain loans from the World\r\n\r\nBank  and other financial institutions, as well as from\r\n\r\nfriendly   countries,   to  finance   its   development\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Hitherto, World Bank loans  have  gone  to\r\n\r\ntraditional  projects such as power  generation,  water\r\n\r\nsupplies  and  port  development. The  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to encourage the statutory authorities to seek\r\n\r\nloans for such \"bankable\" projects, as well as for  new\r\n\r\nschemes such as electricity and water transmission  and\r\n\r\ninternal   telephones.  Such  loans  will  enable   the\r\n\r\nstatutory authorities to reduce their dependence on the\r\n\r\nGovernment for financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Government sector loan applications will\r\n\r\nshortly  be  submitted to the World Bank for education,\r\n\r\nroads  and  sewerage development. As Singapore  has  an\r\n\r\nexcellent   record   of   well-planned   and   executed\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes, there will be a strong case for\r\n\r\nadditional  loan  financing from the  World  Bank.  The\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  has  financed  similar  schemes  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries. On the whole, the balance in the Development\r\n\r\nFund will be quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, though we are making progress, it\r\n\r\nis  not fast enough to be self-sustaining nor is it  of\r\n\r\nthe   magnitude  required  to  solve  our  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.  We  must never forget that Singapore  has  no\r\n\r\nagricultural  base. We do not have what the  economists\r\n\r\ncall  primary  income. Our earnings are  from  services\r\n\r\nrendered, processing and refining of raw materials  and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   -the   last  growing   in   importance.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  we want to live well  and  improve  our\r\n\r\nstandard of living, it is imperative that we should  be\r\n\r\nmore  efficient than others. This calls for the closest\r\n\r\nco-operation between Government, the entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nlabour  and  each must give of its best to bring  about\r\n\r\never-increasing efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given all the incentives necessary\r\n\r\nto attract investment and to provide both the necessary\r\n\r\ninfrastructure as well as a stable political climate to\r\n\r\nmake  investment  possible.  It  is  now  left  to  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  show that they  have  inherited  the\r\n\r\nverve,  resilience, drive and skill of our  forefathers\r\n\r\nand  take  advantage of the facilities  and  incentives\r\n\r\navailable.  The  Productivity Centre will  help  labour\r\n\r\nachieve greater productivity and thereby contribute  to\r\n\r\nour  efforts to industrialise and compete successfully.\r\n\r\nResponsible trade union leaders know that it is through\r\n\r\ngreater  productivity  that wages  can  rise,  for  any\r\n\r\nincrease  in  wages without corresponding  increase  in\r\n\r\noutput will very quickly blunt our industrial drive and\r\n\r\nadd to our army of unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated before, the Government, apart from\r\n\r\nproviding the basic facilities already enumerated, will\r\n\r\nhold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  fair  balance between management and  labour.  While\r\n\r\nseeing to it that there must not be any exploitation of\r\n\r\nlabour,  we must also ensure that entrepreneurs  get  a\r\n\r\nfair return for their investment. Without profits there\r\n\r\nwill  be no investment and therefore no employment.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  our society rightly expects  work  for\r\n\r\nwages paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that\r\n\r\nwithout  primary income we have no buffer to fall  back\r\n\r\non.  If there is a deterioration in the services we are\r\n\r\nrendering or, worse still, a breakdown in the provision\r\n\r\nof  such  services, inevitably this  would  lead  to  a\r\n\r\ncollapse  of  our  economy.  It  is  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  see that no section of  the  population\r\n\r\nendangers  the  standard of efficiency, either  through\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding   of   the   situation   or    through\r\n\r\nirresponsible   behaviour,  such  as  malingering   and\r\n\r\nrestrictive practices, which we see creeping  into  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  Prompt and effective action will be  taken  to\r\n\r\nstop the rot wherever it is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic that the first full year after a\r\n\r\nseparation  we did not seek was better than  the  first\r\n\r\nfull year of a merger and Malaysia we sought and worked\r\n\r\nfor  so long and arduously. For the first full year  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was the first full year of confrontation  and\r\n\r\nsaw our annual growth rate of 8.5 per cent go down to 2\r\n\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has not been so with the first full year of\r\n\r\nIndependence  after  we  were suddenly  separated  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Although the percentage increase of our Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product is not as yet available, the  figures\r\n\r\nshow  an increase of between 9 per cent and 12 per cent\r\n\r\nin  trade and revenue - cause for quiet confidence. But\r\n\r\nthis  confidence  must  not lead  us  to  smugness  and\r\n\r\ncomplacency.  It  must  not lead  our  people,  whether\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, or trade unionists, into believing  that\r\n\r\nthe  world owes us a living and that things will always\r\n\r\nbe  all  right. They will be all right only if  we  are\r\n\r\nconstantly alert, efficient and striving. For  ours  is\r\n\r\nnot  any  ordinary  economy like  that  of  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries in this region. Our future is at once fraught\r\n\r\nwith  peril and yet bright with promise, depending upon\r\n\r\nhow things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork out in Asia as a whole. If big power conflicts are\r\n\r\ncontained   and   the   smaller   countries   turn   to\r\n\r\nconstructive pursuits, then we shall thrive and prosper\r\n\r\nin  peace.  If not, we must inevitably be embroiled  in\r\n\r\ngrievous  strife, with big powers exploiting the  petty\r\n\r\nfeuds,  jealousies and rivalries. But these are matters\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  dispensation. What we can see  clearly  is\r\n\r\ninto  the  70's  for,  barring the unexpected,  we  can\r\n\r\nassume a relatively quiet and secure situation in  this\r\n\r\ncorner  of  South-East Asia. But  we  have  lived  long\r\n\r\nenough  to learn that the unexpected does often  happen\r\n\r\nand  we are learning to make contingency provisions for\r\n\r\nsuch accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been my good fortune as Finance Minister for\r\n\r\ntwo  successive years not to have had to raise  revenue\r\n\r\nby  increases in the rates of taxation. This year,  the\r\n\r\nonly  change is in the method of computing  the  motor-vehicle  tax, which will bring in a small  increase  of\r\n\r\n$5\u00bd  million in revenue, a step we are taking  more  to\r\n\r\nestablish  sound principles of taxation than  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  the $5\u00bd million. But Singapore cannot assume that\r\n\r\nthe  expanding  cost of education,  health  and  social\r\n\r\nservices,  plus  added burdens of our separate  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure, can always look after themselves.  On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  my officials have had to do their unpopular\r\n\r\nduty of using the pruning knife whenever they feel that\r\n\r\nan  item of expenditure was extravagant in relation  to\r\n\r\nour  own  economic  capacity. On the  other  hand,  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and workers must give of their  best  to\r\n\r\nkeep  this  economy humming and thriving, so  that  the\r\n\r\nincreased  economic  activity  will  always   give   an\r\n\r\nincreasing revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided there is a clear appreciation of the\r\n\r\nelementary  facts  of  life in our  lean  society,  and\r\n\r\nprovided  that  each and every sector plays  its  part,\r\n\r\nthere is no reason at all why we should not be able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  our goal of a better life for all. Our  people\r\n\r\nhave  got what it takes to make Singapore prosper. What\r\n\r\nis  required now is an awareness of the problems before\r\n\r\nus  and a concerted response made to meet the challenge\r\n\r\nof our separate destiny.

The Explanatory Statement to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  sets  out  in detail  the  reasons  for  the\r\n\r\namendments, and for this reason and also because it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  to  refer this Bill to a Select Committee  if\r\n\r\nits  Second  Reading is approved, I do not  propose  to\r\n\r\ndeal  in  detail with the amendments proposed. I  shall\r\n\r\nonly  confine  myself to a few of the amendments  which\r\n\r\naffect the principle of the legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Women's Charter, 1961, was to\r\n\r\nbring  all  marriages  (other  than  Muslim  marriages)\r\n\r\nsolemnised  in  Singapore  within  the  ambit  of   the\r\n\r\nCharter,  so that all such marriages in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe  solemnised  and registered under the Charter.  This\r\n\r\nclearly has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nnot  been achieved, for there are still a large  number\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  customary marriages  which  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nsolemnised  outside the Ordinance.  It  is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nproposed  to amend the Ordinance to make it clear  that\r\n\r\nChinese  customary  marriages  will  come  within   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Ordinance and that  they  must  be\r\n\r\nsolemnised and registered under the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Let  me  at once say that  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government to prevent such  customary\r\n\r\nmarriages from taking place, as it is not the intention\r\n\r\nof   the  Government  to  prevent  Christian  or  Hindu\r\n\r\nmarriages from being solemnised in Singapore. All  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  required will be that a person, before  going\r\n\r\nthrough  a  Chinese customary marriage,  should  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  relating  to\r\n\r\nfreedom to marry, age and consent. All persons will  be\r\n\r\nrequired to obtain a certificate for marriage under the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Ordinance, but once he has  obtained\r\n\r\nthis,  he  is  free to have his marriage solemnised  or\r\n\r\nperformed or carried out in any way he likes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major amendment in the Bill relates to the\r\n\r\nrights of married women as regards their property.  The\r\n\r\nBill seeks to make it clear that married women may deal\r\n\r\nwith their property in the same way as men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill next seeks to bring the law relating to\r\n\r\ndivorce  in  line  with  recent  legislation  in  other\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries. When the Women's  Charter  was\r\n\r\nenacted,  the provisions of the Divorce Ordinance  were\r\n\r\nincorporated  in it without any substantial  amendment.\r\n\r\nThe law relating to divorce has, however, moved forward\r\n\r\nand the tendency in many countries is to recognise what\r\n\r\nis  known as the \"breakdown\" principle - that is,  that\r\n\r\nif a marriage is broken down and the Court is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  the  parties can no longer live with each  other,\r\n\r\nthen it is right that the marriage should be put an end\r\n\r\nto.  This  principle, Mr Speaker, Sir, which has  been\r\n\r\naccepted  in  Australia and New  Zealand  and  in  many\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries, is adopted in the  amending  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill also seeks to provide more opportunities  for\r\n\r\nreconciliation before a divorce is decreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the children of void or\r\n\r\nvoidable marriages should be regarded as legitimate, as\r\n\r\nit   is  not  their  fault  that  their  parents   have\r\n\r\ncontracted the void marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that the Bill will be welcomed as a\r\n\r\nfurther  step  in  the improvement of the  position  of\r\n\r\nwomen and children in our family law. The rationale  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill is that the happiness of the family should  be\r\n\r\nfostered by the law, but when all efforts fail,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter for the parties to part rather than to be forced\r\n\r\nto live together in unhappiness and strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Women's Charter was formulated in  1961  and\r\n\r\npassed   in  that  year.  By  its  enactment,  we   can\r\n\r\nunderstand that the purpose is to enhance the  position\r\n\r\nof  women in Singapore, to enable them to secure  their\r\n\r\nrightful place in society - equal to men - and to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  same  rights  and privileges  as  men.  Since  its\r\n\r\nintroduction  and during the period of its enforcement,\r\n\r\nwe  have found that certain provisions in the Ordinance\r\n\r\ncannot  give effect to the purpose that we  intend.  As\r\n\r\nthese  provisions do not achieve the  purpose,  it  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, proper and correct that the Minister  should\r\n\r\nintroduce amending legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is something in this amending Bill which I\r\n\r\nregret  very  much. The Minister has  omitted  a  point\r\n\r\nwhich is more important than what he has said. This  is\r\n\r\nin  relation  to the representation which the  previous\r\n\r\nMinister  received  from  the Women's  Section  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  The  representation  stated  that  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter, in addition to enabling women to secure  their\r\n\r\nequal  and  rightful  place in Singapore,  should  also\r\n\r\neradicate  the practice of polygamy - the  practice  of\r\n\r\nhaving  three  wives and four concubines  -  which  has\r\n\r\ncaused  disharmony  in the family and  disturbance  and\r\n\r\ndisquiet  in  our society. According to  the  law  then\r\n\r\nprevailing, certainly if any one wanted to marry he had\r\n\r\nto  register  under  the Women's  Charter  to  get  his\r\n\r\nmarriage legalised before it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the  law. Then would  the  practice  of\r\n\r\nmonogamy be effected. But we have found that there is a\r\n\r\nbig  loophole.  This is in regard to the definition  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"mistress\". A man can have  many  mistresses\r\n\r\noutside  his family. If he does not register,  then  in\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of the law he cannot be punished,  and  this\r\n\r\ninvariably constitutes a system of polygamy.  From  the\r\n\r\ntime  when the Women's Charter was enforced up to  now,\r\n\r\nwe  have  found  that the number of divorces  has  been\r\n\r\nquite high. This has been due mainly to such a practice\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said,  that is to say, though  women  have\r\n\r\nnominal  protection  under the law,  the  law  has,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  not  provided  actual  protection  for   them,\r\n\r\nbecause   their  husbands  could  cohabit   with   many\r\n\r\nmistresses outside their homes. As a result,  it  leads\r\n\r\nto  disharmony  in the family which in  turn  leads  to\r\n\r\ndivorces. All this is because of the definition of  the\r\n\r\nword \"mistress\" which is not clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out something about clause 28\r\n\r\nin  the amending Bill before us today. This appears  on\r\n\r\npage  8, line 35, in which connection the Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  divorce just now. When a  couple  have  been\r\n\r\nmarried  for  some time and find that they cannot  live\r\n\r\ntogether,   they  separate.  During  their  period   of\r\n\r\nseparation,  they  may hope to resume their  harmonious\r\n\r\nrelationship and live together again. But this amending\r\n\r\nBill  provides that if after seven years of  separation\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  hope  to  be  united  again,  then  their\r\n\r\nseparation   can  be  confirmed.  Arising   from   this\r\n\r\nprovision, the pretext, \"I am not satisfied and  cannot\r\n\r\nlive  happily with my wife,\" can be used as  an  excuse\r\n\r\nfor  divorce to marry someone else. During this  period\r\n\r\nof  separation the law does not provide the couple with\r\n\r\nany  means to reconciliate or to be reunited. So I feel\r\n\r\nthat   this   provision  in  the  Bill  is  not   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  that  if a husband, whose  marriage  was\r\n\r\nregistered  under the law, finds that  he  cannot  live\r\n\r\ntogether with his wife again after a period of 7 years,\r\n\r\nhe  could  ask for a divorce. Why should  a  period  of\r\n\r\nseven years be provided? That is not quite correct.  We\r\n\r\nshould have a proper and more effective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  in the law to prohibit or restrict  the  man\r\n\r\nfrom  getting more mistresses outside the home.

In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  want to implement the law to protect  women\r\n\r\nand enhance their position in society, and generally to\r\n\r\nimprove  society  as  a  whole. This  amending  law  is\r\n\r\nproviding  men with more opportunities to  evade  their\r\n\r\nrightful  duties to their wives, which will worsen  the\r\n\r\nwomen's  position.

I do  not\r\n\r\nagree with this provision in clause 28, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will reconsider it when the Bill is in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  in  the  hope that women  can  enjoy  their\r\n\r\nrightful  place  in the new society now that  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  advanced from self-government to independence.

Hon. Members of the House may ask why it  has\r\n\r\nbeen found necessary to re-enact the provisions of this\r\n\r\nAct. This is due to the following main reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Statutory deposits in respect of insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  operating in Singapore are kept  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Accountant General and can no longer  be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to  cover  liabilities  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ninsurers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) By virtue of the fact that Singapore is no longer\r\n\r\na  part  of  the Federation of Malaysia,  Singapore\r\n\r\nsecurities are now automatically excluded from  the\r\n\r\nschedule of approved assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is desirable that some amendments which have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to  the Malaysian Act since  separation\r\n\r\nshould   also  be  incorporated  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly the Bill is a comprehensive piece of\r\n\r\nlegislation  designed  to  control  and  supervise  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of all types of insurance business. The  basic\r\n\r\nobjective  of the Bill is to prevent the repetition  of\r\n\r\nunscrupulous practices like those of mushroom insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  to  encourage  the  growth  of  healthy\r\n\r\ninsurance business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the contents of the Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nto elaborate on the more salient clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill classifies insurance business\r\n\r\ninto  two  main categories, namely, life insurance  and\r\n\r\ngeneral insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 lay down the minimum conditions of\r\n\r\noperations of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsurance    companies   in   Singapore.   These    are\r\n\r\nregistration   with  the  Insurance  Commissioner   and\r\n\r\nlodging  a statutory deposit of $300,000 for each  type\r\n\r\nof  insurance  business  conducted.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner must be satisfied that an insurer applying\r\n\r\nfor  registration must have a surplus  of  assets  over\r\n\r\nliabilities of not less than $1 million if he  proposes\r\n\r\nto  carry  on  one  type of insurance  business,  or  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  assets over liabilities of  at  least  $l\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  if  he  proposes to carry  on  both  types  of\r\n\r\ninsurance business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill specify the type of\r\n\r\nassets  that  may  be  accepted as statutory  deposits.\r\n\r\nThese  are  cash,  approved securities  listed  in  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule  to this Bill, bank  covenants,  or  a\r\n\r\ncombination  of  any of these items. As  the  statutory\r\n\r\ndeposit  can  be regarded as a final safeguard  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of policy holders, it logically follows  that\r\n\r\nthe  securities  deposited have to be of  the  soundest\r\n\r\ntype,  and it is for this reason that the Minister  has\r\n\r\nbeen given discretionary powers to refuse acceptance of\r\n\r\nsecurities  which  are considered not satisfactory  for\r\n\r\nthe   purposes  of  a  statutory  deposit.  With   this\r\n\r\nobjective  in mind, I shall be introducing an amendment\r\n\r\nto  clause  8 during the Committee Stage of  the  House\r\n\r\nwhich  will enable the Minister to limit the amount  of\r\n\r\nstatutory deposit lodged in the form of bank covenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill requires insurers to establish\r\n\r\nand  maintain  an  insurance  fund  for  each  type  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  business  conducted  for  the  purposes   of\r\n\r\nmeeting liabilities of Singapore policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Yes, Mr Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Clause 11 stipulates that a minimum\r\n\r\nof  55  per cent of the assets of the fund must consist\r\n\r\nof  approved securities which are listed in the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule to this Bill. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassets  in  the Second Schedule are local in character,\r\n\r\nthis  provision makes it necessary for insurers to keep\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, local assets to match at  least  55  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the liabilities they have contracted.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  found that, with regard to some general insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies,  outstanding premiums and  agents'  balances\r\n\r\ncomprise a disproportionately large percentage  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  assets of their insurance funds. This is clearly\r\n\r\nundesirable as the solvency of the fund is dependent on\r\n\r\nthe  extent to which such premiums and balances can  be\r\n\r\ncollected.  Clause 11 (2) of the Bill therefore  limits\r\n\r\nsuch  balances and premiums to l2\u00bd per cent of  written\r\n\r\npremiums.  To allow insurers to achieve this percentage\r\n\r\nsmoothly   and  with  minimum  difficulty, a   2-year\r\n\r\ntransitional  period is allowed during  which  insurers\r\n\r\nare   required  gradually  to  reduce  the  amount   of\r\n\r\noutstanding premiums and agents' balances held as  part\r\n\r\nof  their insurance funds until the target of  12\u00bd  per\r\n\r\ncent is achieved. Again I wish to state here, Sir, that\r\n\r\nduring  the  Committee Stage of the House,  I  will  be\r\n\r\nproposing an amendment to this clause which will  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to increase the minimum percentage of  55\r\n\r\nper  cent and to specify the minimum or maximum  amount\r\n\r\nof  this 55 per cent that may be invested in any one or\r\n\r\nmore of the items listed in the Second Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 and 23 relate specifically to life\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies. Clause 15 provides  that  premium\r\n\r\nrates  charged  by  life insurance  companies  must  be\r\n\r\napproved by qualified actuaries, whilst clause 23 makes\r\n\r\nit necessary for regular actuarial investigations to be\r\n\r\nmade into the financial condition of the life insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of clause 22, all insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies are required to lodge annual returns with the\r\n\r\nCommissioner. The Commissioner can request insurers  to\r\n\r\nfurnish  him with information related to their business\r\n\r\nif the information is required for the proper discharge\r\n\r\nof his functions under the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 lays down the conditions under which the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  may institute an investigation  into  the\r\n\r\nwhole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  part  of  the business of an insurer.

It is designed to  control  and\r\n\r\nregulate the insurance industry in Singapore.  My  only\r\n\r\ncriticism  of this Bill is that it is not comprehensive\r\n\r\nenough,  especially in regard to motor  insurance.  The\r\n\r\nlaw  with regard to motor insurance at present requires\r\n\r\ncompulsory third-party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsurance.  But  third-party insurance,  unfortunately,\r\n\r\ndoes  not include passenger liability. I would  request\r\n\r\nthe   Government   to   consider  including   passenger\r\n\r\nliability  possibly in an amendment to the Third  Party\r\n\r\nRisks   and   Compensation  Ordinance  as   third-party\r\n\r\nliability. Under the existing law, Mr Speaker, Sir, an\r\n\r\ninsurance company can still avoid liability with regard\r\n\r\nto third-party risks in certain circumstances. This may\r\n\r\nbe  just  in  respect of the insured, but it definitely\r\n\r\nworks an injustice towards the injured third party.  To\r\n\r\novercome this, possibly Government can consider setting\r\n\r\nup  an  insurance  compensation  fund.  This  could  be\r\n\r\ncontributed  to by the insurance companies  undertaking\r\n\r\nmotor insurance business. The alternative is to require\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies to insure drivers with  regard  to\r\n\r\nthird-party risks rather than insuring cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House an example. Many of our\r\n\r\nGovernment  Front-benchers are accomplished golfers.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand the Minister concerned with this Bill is one\r\n\r\nof  them. A golfer should insure himself against third-party liability, in case he hits the ball into somebody\r\n\r\ninstead  of  into  the  hole. The present  position  of\r\n\r\ninsuring cars instead of insuring drivers is as  absurd\r\n\r\nas  insuring the golfers' clubs rather than the golfers\r\n\r\nthemselves against third-party liability. Yet we  think\r\n\r\nnothing of that. May I recommend the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill to spend a few thoughts on  this  point,\r\n\r\npossibly between golf shots?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also clause 8 of the Bill enables an insurer to get\r\n\r\nout of the deposit by getting a bank covenant. No doubt\r\n\r\nthe primary object of requiring the $300,000 deposit is\r\n\r\nthat   there  should  be  enough  money  to   pay   any\r\n\r\ncompensation when compensation is payable.  But  surely\r\n\r\nthere should be a secondary object, that this amount of\r\n\r\nmoney  should  be  invested in  securities,  especially\r\n\r\nsecurities of local industries. So this requirement  of\r\n\r\na $300,000 deposit would kill two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\nIt  would  also  oblige insurance companies  to  invest\r\n\r\ntheir money locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\ngood Bill on the whole, and with the exception of these\r\n\r\nminor criticisms, I support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am most grateful\r\n\r\nto  the  hon.

As reorganisation gathers\r\n\r\nmomentum,    the   Singapore   Government's   financial\r\n\r\ncommitment  towards the University will increase.  Even\r\n\r\nnow  the cost of maintaining a Nanyang student is about\r\n\r\n$2,000  a year. Malaysian students who pay $720 a  year\r\n\r\nin  fee  without  any  assistance  from  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  are being subsidised by the Government  and\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore at the rate of about  $1,300  per\r\n\r\nstudent per year. At the same time, contributions  from\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector  in support of Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nhave dwindled to negligible sums. In point of fact, the\r\n\r\ntotal  amount of private donations collected since  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  Nanyang University  is  considerably\r\n\r\nless  than  what  the public has been led  to  believe.\r\n\r\nAccording   to   figures  published  in   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Tenth  Anniversary  Souvenir,  the   amount\r\n\r\ncollected from 1963 to 1965 was only $12,070,000.  This\r\n\r\nwas  the sum collected in dribs and drabs over a period\r\n\r\nof 13 years as compared with the $6.7 million which the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government has spent on the University during\r\n\r\nthe  last  two and a half years. It is also significant\r\n\r\nthat of the $12 million raised from the private sector,\r\n\r\nSingapore,  exclusive of Government  grants,  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  80  per  cent of this $12 million,  while  others,\r\n\r\nincluding  all  the  constituent  States  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\naccounted  for  only 20 per cent. In the circumstances,\r\n\r\nit  is  only  right and proper that Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nshould  have  the  final say on how Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nshould  be  run.  However, if, as reported  in  today's\r\n\r\nEastern  Sun, certain Malaysian parents of the expelled\r\n\r\nstudents believe that Singapore citizens who are paying\r\n\r\nfor  practically  the  whole cost  of  running  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  have a dominant say in its  affairs,  then\r\n\r\nthey can always set up their own university or persuade\r\n\r\ntheir own Government to set up a Chinese University  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and the Singapore Government will  undertake\r\n\r\nto  refund every cent that the Malaysians have  donated\r\n\r\ntowards the establishment of Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 7 of the\r\n\r\nBill  before the House provides for a 21-member Council\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  the Vice-Chancellor, 2 members  elected\r\n\r\nfrom the Senate, 2 members from the Guild of Graduates,\r\n\r\n3  members  elected by members of the  University  from\r\n\r\namongst  themselves, 7 members appointed by the Council\r\n\r\nfrom  persons  prominent  in the  field  of  education,\r\n\r\nculture,  industry or commerce, and 6 members appointed\r\n\r\nby  the  Government of whom 3 may be  persons  resident\r\n\r\noutside Singapore. In making possible participation  of\r\n\r\npersons  resident  outside Singapore in  the  governing\r\n\r\nbody of Nanyang, the present University Council and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are mindful of the support Malaysians  have\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the University in the past and  the  sincere\r\n\r\ndesire to preserve the sentimental link between Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and the Malaysian people who, we hope,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  support  the  University  financially  or\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide for continuity in policy making,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  also seeks to extend the term of office  of\r\n\r\nCouncil members from two to four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments proposed in this Bill are of a\r\n\r\nminor  character. Provision is made for the appointment\r\n\r\nof   a  Deputy  Vice-Chancellor  to  assist  the  Vice-Chancellor in carrying out his onerous duties. Such  an\r\n\r\nappointment  has  been found to be  essential  in  most\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  the  world. At  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\ndesignations  of some existing posts in the  University\r\n\r\nas  laid  down  in the Ordinance are to be  changed  to\r\n\r\nconform   to   designations  currently  used   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As such, the office of the President as provided for in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  is  to  be changed  to  that  of  Vice-Chancellor, which has been the designation  used  since\r\n\r\n1960.  Similarly,  the designations  of  Secretary  and\r\n\r\nTreasurer  are  to be changed to Registrar  and  Bursar\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the existing Ordinance has two separate\r\n\r\nsections  to  provide similar powers to the  University\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Section 29 provides for rules to be  made  by\r\n\r\nthe Council and section 32 provides for statutes to  be\r\n\r\nmade.  In order to avoid duplication without curtailing\r\n\r\nthe  powers of the Council, this Bill seeks to  enlarge\r\n\r\nthe  powers of the Council to make rules and remove its\r\n\r\npower  to  make  statutes.  This  is  accomplished   by\r\n\r\nconferring  on the Council the power to make additional\r\n\r\nrules  governing the powers and duties of the  officers\r\n\r\nof  the University; the composition, powers, duties and\r\n\r\nprocedure of the Senate and the Guild of Graduates, and\r\n\r\nthe  discipline and welfare of students. With this  new\r\n\r\nprovision  all  the matters at present  dealt  with  by\r\n\r\nstatutes  will  be  adequately covered  by  rules,  and\r\n\r\nsection  32 providing for the Council to make  statutes\r\n\r\nmay therefore be repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements in the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  there is reason to believe  that  continued\r\n\r\nsupport for the University will be forthcoming not only\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore but also from Malaysia.  Of  the  1,678\r\n\r\nstudents  at present in Nanyang University, 840  or  50\r\n\r\nper cent are from Malaysia. As I have said earlier, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has been  subsidising  each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one  of these students at the rate of  $1,300  a\r\n\r\nyear,  and  the  cost will increase  as  reorganisation\r\n\r\nproceeds  apace. Clearly the Government and the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore should not be expected to bear this burden\r\n\r\nindefinitely without assistance. On our part, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill   continue  to  welcome  students  from   Malaysia\r\n\r\nprovided they are here to seek knowledge, to acquire an\r\n\r\neducation and to make use of our facilities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nwhich are lacking in their own country.

However,  we\r\n\r\nare  hopeful that the unhappy events of the  past  will\r\n\r\nnot  recur  and  that  a  new breed  of  students  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will  join  their brethren  in  Singapore  at\r\n\r\nNanyang  solely  for the pursuit of knowledge  so  that\r\n\r\nunder  the  guidance  of  the new  policy  makers,  the\r\n\r\nadministrators  and the teachers, the  University  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  into  a true centre of learning  not  only  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but in the whole of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on the question of amending the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Ordinance,  I, as  a  graduate  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  am particularly concerned with  this  Bill\r\n\r\nand I feel that it is necessary to speak my mind on it.\r\n\r\nIn  the  first place, I wish to say in all  earnestness\r\n\r\nthat  I  support the amendments to the existing Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Ordinance, which is an Ordinance drafted and\r\n\r\npassed  into law by the Lim Yew Hock regime before  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came  to  power.  This  Ordinance  came   into\r\n\r\noperation on 27th May, 1959. Several years have elapsed\r\n\r\nand  Nanyang University has developed. During this time\r\n\r\nwe have discovered that the Ordinance has not been able\r\n\r\nto  withstand  the  test  of time.  There  are  certain\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory features in it. For example,  section  9\r\n\r\nprovides  for a Register of members being kept  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary.  But in the subsection there is a  provision\r\n\r\nregarding  the withdrawal of membership and the  letter\r\n\r\nof  withdrawal  is  to be addressed  to  the  Registrar\r\n\r\ninstead of the Secretary of the University Council. All\r\n\r\nthis  is  very  confusing,  and  in  implementing   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, we find many defects in it. So this  is  not\r\n\r\nideal legislation. The existing Ordinance is unable  to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace with the progress of Nanyang University and,\r\n\r\neven from the legislative point of view, it is far from\r\n\r\nclosely knit. This was drafted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  ten years ago, and even at that time it was found\r\n\r\nto  be defective. And at the present moment, it is even\r\n\r\nmore   defective.  I  shall,  therefore,  support   the\r\n\r\namendments to the existing Ordinance. They must be made\r\n\r\nto   meet   the  progressive  requirements  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.   Otherwise,   the   Ordinance   will    be\r\n\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, talking about the Constitution of the\r\n\r\nUniversity,  this  is a statutory corporation.  So  its\r\n\r\nmembership has statutory force, and this is  the  basis\r\n\r\non  which  we  must  work. At  the  time  when  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity was first established, the sponsors, perhaps\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their desire to have more  donations  from\r\n\r\npeople in all walks of life, welcomed all persons to be\r\n\r\nmembers  of the University. But after several years  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment, in so far as the members of the University\r\n\r\nare  concerned, they must have a new attitude and a new\r\n\r\noutlook. It is not just a matter of accepting donations\r\n\r\nfrom  the people. It is also a matter of administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol and certain adjustments should be made to  meet\r\n\r\nNanyang University's developing requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the existing Ordinance of Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nwe  can see that there are several grades of membership\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang University. If a person donates $1,000,  he\r\n\r\ncan become a patron for life. If he pays up to $10,000,\r\n\r\nhe  can become a life member. All these provisions  are\r\n\r\nvery   defective,   because  there  are   no   detailed\r\n\r\nprovisions of a comprehensive nature to keep pace  with\r\n\r\nthe development of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant given by the Government of Singapore to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University amounts to millions of dollars.  As\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  has  already  indicated,  the  question\r\n\r\ndefinitely  arises  as to whether  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  permanent patron of Nanyang  University.  So\r\n\r\neven in law itself, there is a problem. According to, I\r\n\r\nthink, Rule 13 of the Second Schedule to the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhen  a  patron is required to vote, he  can  have  one\r\n\r\nvote.  In the general meeting, the Government  is  also\r\n\r\nentitled  to  one  vote in its capacity  as  a  member.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can try to solve this problem through\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegislative  procedure or by adding certain  provisions\r\n\r\nto the existing Ordinance. But this is not mentioned in\r\n\r\nthe present amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that under the existing Ordinance of\r\n\r\nNanyang University, so long as a person donates $1,000,\r\n\r\nhe  can become a member, but there is no restriction on\r\n\r\nthe  membership,  be he a resident,  a  criminal  or  a\r\n\r\nwinner  of  a  four-digit lottery! This is a  situation\r\n\r\nwhich demands our attention, because if some people who\r\n\r\nare  believers in Communism are rich enough  to  become\r\n\r\nmembers  of Nanyang University, then they can  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They can have 2,000 persons paying  $1,000\r\n\r\neach,  and  they can then control the University  under\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Ordinance. This is a big loophole  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  exploited.  We must therefore  take  steps  to\r\n\r\nattend to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, members of the Nanyang University are\r\n\r\nnot  confined to Singapore alone. Some are in Hongkong,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Thailand  and Malaysia.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Republic Independence Constitution, there  is\r\n\r\na   provision   concerning  membership   in   statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations. Any person or group of persons  who  want\r\n\r\nto  become  members  of  any  statutory  body,  or  any\r\n\r\ncorporation  of  a statutory nature,  must  have  their\r\n\r\nnames approved by the President and gazetted. So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether some Malaysians, who are members  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University under the existing  Ordinance,  are\r\n\r\nstill considered members. I would like clarification on\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one question regarding the election of three\r\n\r\nmembers  to  the  University  Council  at  the  general\r\n\r\nmeeting.  We  all  know  that the  members  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  are many in number. So any general  meeting\r\n\r\nwill  be  something  like a mass  rally.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  are spread out over various places and  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to hold a general meeting. Experience in  the\r\n\r\npast few years has shown that a general meeting of Nanyang  University is convened on the basis  of  a  State\r\n\r\nrepresentatives' general meeting. So  if  you  consider\r\n\r\nthis in the light of the provisions of the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependence Ordinance, you will realise that  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  members  who are representatives will  lose  their\r\n\r\nmembership,  unless  the  President  of  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngazetted  their  names as members of a statutory  body.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, how can we convene a general\r\n\r\nmeeting? Does it mean that members in different  places\r\n\r\ncan  elect  representatives from among  themselves  and\r\n\r\nthen attend the general meeting of representatives?  Or\r\n\r\nshall  we  do  something else? So this is a legislative\r\n\r\ndetail which must be attended to, otherwise there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a lot of trouble and difficulties. I wish that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education can clarify the true position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, Nanyang University, ever since its\r\n\r\ninception,  has  had  a  lot  of  problems   over   the\r\n\r\nappointment of -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

By  cultural  activities,  I  refer  to  the\r\n\r\ncinemas,  the  night-clubs, the dance  troupes,  books,\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and magazines, chain-picture  story  books,\r\n\r\nand  the  programmes broadcast over the radio and  T.V.\r\n\r\nThe problems I want to deliberate on today concern some\r\n\r\nunhealthy  tendencies  in the above-mentioned  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, culture and art constitute an\r\n\r\nintegral part of the spiritual life of the human being,\r\n\r\nwhose  four  necessities  of material  life  are  food,\r\n\r\nclothing,  shelter and travel. Cultural life  exerts  a\r\n\r\ngreat  influence on mankind as a whole. A good  culture\r\n\r\nwill  not  only substantiate their spiritual  life  but\r\n\r\nwill  also  help foster a good and wholesome character.\r\n\r\nIt will also spark off their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwisdom and thinking, quite apart from stimulating their\r\n\r\nwill  and  spirit to move upwards and towards  goodness\r\n\r\nand  nobility.

This is the kind of bad culture  which  we\r\n\r\nmust discard by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad culture I have mentioned refers to films,\r\n\r\nbooks,   newspapers   and   magazines   which   contain\r\n\r\nlicentious, indecent, corrupting, fantastic and immoral\r\n\r\nmaterial. In the national language this kind of culture\r\n\r\nis  described as Kebudayaan Chabul. This expression has\r\n\r\na   profound   significance  which   connotes   incest,\r\n\r\npromiscuity, immorality, the infringement of the proper\r\n\r\ncode  of  conduct,  sensual,  adulterous  and  criminal\r\n\r\nbehaviour.  In  Singapore at the present  moment,  what\r\n\r\naspects of this bad culture have we? Let me give you  a\r\n\r\nfew  examples.  Our  cinemas  are  still  flooded  with\r\n\r\npictures depicting fantasy, monstrosity, shameless sex,\r\n\r\nmurders,  brigandism, hooliganism, and James  Bond-ism.\r\n\r\nRare indeed are there occasions when one is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreated  to film shows with good themes of an educative\r\n\r\nand meaningful nature. What educative effect will films\r\n\r\nof this undesirable nature have on our people? What bad\r\n\r\ninfluence  will they exert on our youthful  generation?\r\n\r\nIn the world of night clubs, Rock-n-Roll and A-Go-Go is\r\n\r\nthe  rule, and in the dance troupes, excessive exposure\r\n\r\nof  a  sexy  nature is the centre of interest  used  to\r\n\r\nattract  an  audience. What undesirable influence  will\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of culture have on our younger  generation?\r\n\r\nApart  from  this, they learn nothing but  the  art  of\r\n\r\njumping-jack and flirting and petting in their  crudest\r\n\r\nforms. The streets of Singapore are flooded with chain-picture  story  books (Chinese comics) about  monsters,\r\n\r\ngoblins,   and  fantasies,  in  spite  of  the   action\r\n\r\nGovernment  took  last  month  to  ban  the  sale   and\r\n\r\ncirculation  of  such  publications  by  44  publishing\r\n\r\nhouses  in Hongkong. Extensive damage is being done  to\r\n\r\nour  school children, causing them to procrastinate  in\r\n\r\ntheir  studies  and to dream of becoming flying  heroes\r\n\r\nlike Batman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fields of radio and T.V. broadcasting, apart\r\n\r\nfrom   programmes  on  political  talks,  forums,   and\r\n\r\ntraditional dramas which are commendable, our radio and\r\n\r\nT.V, stations have hardly been able to offer  anything\r\n\r\nnew and meaningful. The films shown on T.V., except for\r\n\r\na  small number of good educational ones which are very\r\n\r\nfew  and  far between, are mostly of a farcical nature.\r\n\r\nIf  we  allow this kind of situation to develop in  its\r\n\r\nown course, it will inevitably lead to the emergence of\r\n\r\nsome   serious   social  problem.  It  is,   therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary  to review the position with the utmost  care\r\n\r\nand attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good and healthy culture which I have been\r\n\r\ntalking  about refers to those movies, radio  and  T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   books  and  publications,   etc.,   whose\r\n\r\ncontents  are  such  as to extol  virtues  and  condemn\r\n\r\nvices,   to   cultivate  an  excellent  character,   to\r\n\r\nenlighten  and  educate people to  be  noble  in  their\r\n\r\nthought, to nurture and to bring about a keen sense  of\r\n\r\nmorality  among  the people, and to encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nstrive for goodness and progress.

Many  criminal\r\n\r\nacts  that  are  taking  place  in  society,  such   as\r\n\r\nfighting, robbery, theft, raping, etc., are mostly done\r\n\r\nby young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get down to the cause of all this, yellow films\r\n\r\nand  publications are mostly to blame.  Last  month,  a\r\n\r\nrobbery took place in the Department of Social Welfare.\r\n\r\nThe  robbers  first handed a letter to the  victim.  On\r\n\r\nopening  the  letter,  it was found  to  contain  these\r\n\r\nwords,  \"This  is  a hold-up.\" Is not such  a  dramatic\r\n\r\nrobbery  learnt  from  and modelled  on  the  style  of\r\n\r\nWestern  films  depicting robbery? The harm  caused  by\r\n\r\nthese  unhealthy  films  is,  therefore,  not  a  small\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, it has been the\r\n\r\nconsistent  policy of our Government in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nculture  to  uphold and promote the excellent  cultural\r\n\r\ntraditions of the various races and to curb all  yellow\r\n\r\nculture. Hence, after our Party was voted into power to\r\n\r\nform the Government of self-governing Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   immediately   launched  an   anti-yellow   culture\r\n\r\ncampaign.  Measures  were  taken  to  ban  pornographic\r\n\r\npublications, close down massage parlours, and impose a\r\n\r\nmore  stringent film censorship. On the other hand,  we\r\n\r\nhave  actively promoted a campaign for healthy culture,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the holding of Aneka Ragam Rakyat in  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies which will help promote the  interchange\r\n\r\nand flow of the cultures and arts of the various races,\r\n\r\nplaywriting  contests,  the building  of  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre,  the holding of the South-East Asian  Cultural\r\n\r\nFestival  and other activities. As a result,  there  is\r\n\r\nmanifest in our country a lively, flourishing,  healthy\r\n\r\nculture.  Meanwhile, with the active  encouragement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture, various artist bodies of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity  have also been very active in  recent  years\r\n\r\nand  our  painters have also held many  exhibitions  of\r\n\r\nworks  with  realistic  themes. Therefore,  except  for\r\n\r\nthose   obnoxious  phenomena  I  have  mentioned,   the\r\n\r\ncultural activities in our Republic are, by and  large,\r\n\r\ndeveloping towards the better side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how strict and stringent the Government\r\n\r\nmay  have  been  in its measures, the  sex-mongers  are\r\n\r\nstill  able  to  have their way in  carrying  on  their\r\n\r\nnefarious activities. This is particularly so when  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned  become lax,  thus  facilitating\r\n\r\nsuch  yellow  culture to invade our country,  spreading\r\n\r\nits evil effects, and continuing to poison the minds of\r\n\r\nour  younger generation. For instance, only last  month\r\n\r\n44  chain-picture  story book publishers  in  Hong-Kong\r\n\r\nwere   banned   from  selling  their  publications   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but such publications had already  been  in\r\n\r\ncirculation  here  for more than one year  before  they\r\n\r\nwere  found out and banned. I think it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  why such phantom comics had been allowed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  one  year  before  they  were   banned.\r\n\r\nObviously   this  is  ascribable  to  the  laxity   and\r\n\r\nnegligence on the part of the censoring authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to point out another\r\n\r\naspect of the matter which is rather serious. There are\r\n\r\nhuge  cinema posters displayed at prominent  places  on\r\n\r\nthe  roadside  and  advertisements put  up  by  dancing\r\n\r\ntroupes in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  all  depict  sex  and love-making  and  excessive\r\n\r\nexposure. Similarly, advertisements by the cinemas  and\r\n\r\ndance  troupes appearing in the newspapers also contain\r\n\r\npictures  of excessive sensual exposure. It is  obvious\r\n\r\nthat  posters  and  advertisements  of  such  obscenity\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  allowed to be publicly displayed,  for\r\n\r\nthey  will give rise to a chain of dangerous reactions,\r\n\r\ndaydreaming, culminating in fatal traffic accidents and\r\n\r\nother mishaps. But what puzzles me is that, in spite of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that my colleague, comrade Chan Choy  Siong,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Delta, raised this question  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  last  year and made criticisms of these  obscene\r\n\r\nadvertisements, so far no measures have been  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe department concerned to curb such advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, by enumerating those\r\n\r\nphenomena  of unhealthy culture, I do not mean  to  say\r\n\r\nthat yellow and unhealthy culture is out of all control\r\n\r\nin  our  country.  No.  In  fact,  it  is  still  under\r\n\r\neffective  control. But while we are in the  course  of\r\n\r\nnation-building and bringing up a fine generation after\r\n\r\nus, while the country is engaged in the setting up of a\r\n\r\ndisciplined  society, and while our Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nagain and again stressed the need actively to bring  up\r\n\r\na  new  generation with learning, scientific knowledge,\r\n\r\nstrength  and courage, we should prevent such poisonous\r\n\r\nculture  from continuing its inroads into our  country,\r\n\r\nbringing  in  its train harmful effects on our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.  Therefore, we should take early  steps  to\r\n\r\nprevent and wipe out the spread of such yellow culture,\r\n\r\nbecause  it is against our aim and endeavour to nurture\r\n\r\nand  bring up a fine new generation. If we tolerate its\r\n\r\nexistence, it may even wipe out all our efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly a fine and healthy\r\n\r\nculture  will  bring up and imbue a  people  with  fine\r\n\r\nthinking and character. On the contrary, a bad  culture\r\n\r\nwill  make  a people decadent in thought and lethargic.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  cultural construction is very important  to\r\n\r\nthe  cultivation of character in the people and to  the\r\n\r\ngreat task of nation-building. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe renaissance of Europe in about  the  14th\r\n\r\ncentury  is  a good example. In a multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nsuch as ours, we must, first and foremost, develop  and\r\n\r\ngive   expression  to  the  inherent  fine  traditional\r\n\r\ncultures of the various races. Of course, I do not mean\r\n\r\nto  do  away with all Western culture or to impose  the\r\n\r\nculture  of one race upon the other races, as  this  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  impracticable. In fact, being  situated  at\r\n\r\nthe  hub of South-East Asia and the cross-roads of Asia\r\n\r\nand  Europe, Singapore cannot entirely escape from  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of foreign culture. Even so, in order to look\r\n\r\nafter the interest of our people, we still have to curb\r\n\r\nany   foreign  culture  which  has  excessive  poisons.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  as  an  emergent  independent  Republic,  we\r\n\r\nshould  create  and  enrich our own  fine  culture.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  our  cultural mission should aim at  the  dual\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  enriching the healthy and  recreational\r\n\r\nlife of our people and helping in the promotion of  the\r\n\r\ntask  of  nation-building. How to achieve  these  ideal\r\n\r\naims?  I  feel  it  lies in the  joint  effort  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment and the art circles. If pioneers and workers\r\n\r\nin  our  art circles will exert themselves,  they  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  be able to promote and enrich the  cultural\r\n\r\nlife of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally, on the question of\r\n\r\ncultural  construction, I would like to offer  my  ten-point suggestions for the Minister's reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A complete set of cultural policy be formulated\r\n\r\nto  serve as guidance to all future cultural activities\r\n\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Cultural Consultative Committee be formed,\r\n\r\ncomprising   representatives  from  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCulture,  educational,  arts, cultural,  religious  and\r\n\r\njournalistic circles and the N.T.U.C. to put forward to\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   now   and  then  views   on   cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As we will be having many sittings in the course\r\n\r\nof  the  later part of the month, perhaps Inche Rahamat\r\n\r\ncan  address the House and the Minister can  find  some\r\n\r\nother opportunity to reply to both Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  wish  to speak on  how  our  national\r\n\r\nculture  has deteriorated with the mixture  of  Western\r\n\r\nculture  and  dances, for instance,  the  Shindig,  the\r\n\r\nShake  and the A-Go-Go. But I can conveniently describe\r\n\r\nthem  as  mad  dances. Such dances  have  affected  our\r\n\r\nyounger generation. They have become daydreamers.  They\r\n\r\nhave  completely  neglected their  obligations  towards\r\n\r\nsociety. They have become immoral as a result of  these\r\n\r\nmad  dances. They keep their hair long and  wear  tight\r\n\r\ntrousers  - this also applies to the girls -  with  the\r\n\r\nresult  that we cannot make out who are the  girls  and\r\n\r\nwho  are  the boys! Some of them are still  at  school.\r\n\r\nWith  the  spread  of  such dances  we  fear  that  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and  conduct of our youths will  damage  our\r\n\r\nlocal  customs  which are respected by  other  nations.\r\n\r\nThese   youths   will  neglect  their  responsibilities\r\n\r\ntowards  the  nation and society. Is the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture prepared to condone such a state of affairs, or\r\n\r\nis  it  the  intention  to make  such  mad  dances  our\r\n\r\nnational  item?  I  cannot forget  that  in  1959,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  banned the Rock-n-Roll and the juke  boxes,\r\n\r\nwhich  at  that  time were the craze of both  boys  and\r\n\r\ngirls,  to  such  an extent that they  neglected  their\r\n\r\neducation  and damage was done to their character.  But\r\n\r\nthese  mad  dances are worse than Rock-n-Roll.  Is  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture aware that Television Singapura is\r\n\r\nencouraging  such  dances  through  the  Istana   Pesta\r\n\r\nprogramme? The indications of this programme  are  that\r\n\r\nour  children  are under the influence of  such  yellow\r\n\r\nculture. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister for Culture of Singapore will  take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  ban such dances so that our local traditions\r\n\r\nwill be respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, you have to compress what you\r\n\r\nhave to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to reply in 5 minutes to the matters  raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Members,  who  took 25 minutes.  But  I  shall\r\n\r\nendeavour to do my best. If I have longer time I  shall\r\n\r\ngive a more detailed reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Mr Speaker, the two Members have spoken\r\n\r\ngenerally on the so-called yellow culture prevalent  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Member  for Sembawang  spent  some  20\r\n\r\nminutes  on  this matter. But to sum up his  speech  he\r\n\r\nappeals to the Government to take action to prevent the\r\n\r\nflood  of  yellow culture in Singapore,  to  take  more\r\n\r\nrestrictive  measures against pornographic publications\r\n\r\nand  films,  and to take positive steps  to  promote  a\r\n\r\nhealthy cultural growth. In principle, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  since  1959  been  implementing   this\r\n\r\npolicy.  As a matter of fact, the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nhimself  has  admitted, by the examples given  by  him,\r\n\r\nthat  the situation is not so bad. He says that  yellow\r\n\r\nculture  is  not so rampant as to be beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nSo,  strictly speaking, the so-called unhealthy culture\r\n\r\nis  still under effective control. That is what he says\r\n\r\non his own admission. This is a fact, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before giving a point-by-point reply to\r\n\r\nthe two Members, I shall let the House know briefly our\r\n\r\nnational  policy on culture. It is dependent  upon  the\r\n\r\npolitical  system and the economic environment  of  the\r\n\r\nnation.  It  is  determined  by  the  economy  and  the\r\n\r\npolitics  of the country. In Communist countries  where\r\n\r\nthe  national power is unlimited, even, as  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Geylang Serai has said, if your hair is too long or\r\n\r\nyour  shoes are not where they should be, or the hairdo\r\n\r\nof the women is considered improper, the nation has the\r\n\r\npower to interfere with your personal life and describe\r\n\r\nyou as elements of yellow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nculture and even brand you as anti-nationals. In short,\r\n\r\nin a Communist dictatorship, the State has the power to\r\n\r\ninterfere  with  the  way of life  of  each  and  every\r\n\r\nindividual  in  the country. But in the environment  in\r\n\r\nwhich we live, which is a democratic country practising\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy,  we  do  not   advocate   the\r\n\r\nunlimited   power  of  the  State.  We   have   certain\r\n\r\nlimitations  to  the  power of the  State.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nlooking  after the necessities of the people,  such  as\r\n\r\neducation,  health, food and shelter, and security,  we\r\n\r\nallow  and  respect  certain individual  freedom  of  a\r\n\r\npersonal  nature.  Also, to judge others'  standard  of\r\n\r\nculture  by your own standard, and to impose  your  own\r\n\r\nstandard  upon  others,  is  against  the  spirit   and\r\n\r\nprinciple of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point. An African ballet troupe\r\n\r\ncame  to Singapore some time ago. Some members  of  the\r\n\r\ntroupe  were  half-naked. If the Member  for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nwere to see the show, he would not be able to sleep the\r\n\r\nwhole night! But, generally speaking, from the artistic\r\n\r\nand  aesthetic  point of view, such half-nakedness  was\r\n\r\nnot  provocative. It had an artistic effect.  Even  the\r\n\r\nfolk  dance  of  Egypt, the belly  dance,  which  is  a\r\n\r\ntraditional dance, may be considered by some foreigners\r\n\r\nto  be  yellow culture. But in a democracy we must  not\r\n\r\nadopt the views of a few Members and impose them on the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore in general and restrict  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir cultural activities. We will not force people  to\r\n\r\ncut  their hair short, because, by so doing we will  be\r\n\r\nacting against democratic principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the promotion of a healthy culture, I\r\n\r\nshall  take  this  opportunity to say that  ever  since\r\n\r\n1959, when we initiated the Aneka Ragam Rakyat, we have\r\n\r\nalso taken steps to establish a council which plans  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  a purely local-orientated cultural festival  to\r\n\r\ndisplay  the work of our artists in Singapore. We  want\r\n\r\nour  artists and other experts to study and  to  create\r\n\r\nnew  art forms in Singapore and we shall launch  a  new\r\n\r\nart  festival next year. In the field of drama we shall\r\n\r\nencourage  our  playwrights to write  works  reflecting\r\n\r\nlocal life for our radio and television.

The Government,\r\n\r\ntaking  cognizance of the acute shortage of  land,  has\r\n\r\ndecided  that  the  policy  regarding  such  settlement\r\n\r\nshould   be  reviewed  in  the  light  of  our  rapidly\r\n\r\nincreasing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Ayer Gemuroh for instance, some 82 acres of land\r\n\r\nwere  set  aside  for  a Malay settlement.  This  land,\r\n\r\nhowever, was not completely vacant as at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime of gazetting in March 1959 there were already  190\r\n\r\nMalay,  16 Chinese and 5 Indian families living on  it.\r\n\r\nIn  the  same year, 8 new families moved into the  area\r\n\r\nand  were  allocated  one lot each.  Hence,  though  in\r\n\r\ntheory it would appear that there were many lots  which\r\n\r\nstill  remain to be allocated, in actual fact not  much\r\n\r\nland  is available for allocation at the site. Further,\r\n\r\nsome  parts  of this land are low lying and subject  to\r\n\r\nfloods, and to make these parts suitable for habitation\r\n\r\nwill  require considerable expenditure of public  funds\r\n\r\ntowards  earthworks and the construction of a  sea-wall\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the provision of roads, drainage,  water,\r\n\r\nelectricity   and  other  facilities.   The   cost   of\r\n\r\nearthworks alone has been estimated at $40,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the heavy expenditure required to settle a\r\n\r\nfew   more   families  in  this  area,  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsiders that alternative means may have to  be  found\r\n\r\nto  solve the housing problem of the applicants, as  it\r\n\r\nis  evident that the advantages to be gained  from  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure of funds at Ayer Gemuroh will be very  much\r\n\r\nless  than  if  the same sum of money  is  spent  on  a\r\n\r\nplanned housing estate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
