Member knows, construction\r\n\r\nwork on Hindu Temples of this size generally takes\r\n\r\na considerable  time  to  complete,  and  I   am\r\n\r\ninfornied  that  work on these  temples  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing on at the normal rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Building Contractors commenced the work\r\n\r\nof  the  building of Perumal and Sivan Temples  at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of April 1961, and completed  their\r\n\r\nwork on both Temples in May 1962.

I said that a  study  was\r\n\r\nmade  in  July 1963, some months before the  trade\r\n\r\nsuspension actually took place, to assess the  pos\r\n\r\nsible effects of an economic blockade of Singapore\r\n\r\nby  Indonesia. Our calculations showed  that  some\r\n\r\n8,200  workers will eventually he laid off in  the\r\n\r\nevent  that  the Indonesian blockade is completely\r\n\r\neffective.  There  may  be  a  reduction  of   the\r\n\r\nnational income by some $208 million or 8.7  per\r\n\r\ncent of the gross national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just over six months have passed and both\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House and  the  general  public\r\n\r\noutside  may  be  interested to know  what  damage\r\n\r\neconomic  confrontation did actually inflict  upon\r\n\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into details, it may be useful if I\r\n\r\nwere   to   remind  the  Assembly  of  the   gross\r\n\r\nexaggeration  indulged in by some Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in assessing the losses that  we  would\r\n\r\nsuffer by way of income and employment. One Member\r\n\r\nof the House placed an increase in unemployment as\r\n\r\nhigh  as 20,000. Barisan Sosialis Members  in  particular predicted with great relish a collapse  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  which  they had gleefully  expected.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, entirely in keeping with their\r\n\r\npro-Indonesia anti-Malaysia political line. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I stress that the estimates which emerged\r\n\r\nfrom  our researches last July were based  on  the\r\n\r\nassumption of a total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclosure   of  firms  engaged  in  processing   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials imported from Indonesia as well  as  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  laying-off of ships formerly  plying  on\r\n\r\nIndonesian routes? In other words, they  were  the\r\n\r\nmaximum possible effects, in the event, the  worst\r\n\r\ndid  not happen. Ships that were temporarily laid-off  soon  resumed work on new shipping routes  to\r\n\r\nBurma,  to  Thailand,  to ports  of  Malaysia,  in\r\n\r\ncluding those in Sabah and Sarawak, Hongkong,  and\r\n\r\nother  places. The closing down of all  processing\r\n\r\nfactories also did not take place. For some months\r\n\r\nstocks  of raw materials were adequate to maintain\r\n\r\nproduction   and   employment,  and   after   that\r\n\r\nalternative supply lines were opened to  enable  a\r\n\r\nnumber of these firms to continue in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year the Department of Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  was established and it put into operation\r\n\r\ntwo schemes. The first was to pay laid-off workers\r\n\r\na  monthly  allowance equivalent to two-thirds  of\r\n\r\ntheir income from employment. The total number  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  received benefits under this  scheme\r\n\r\nwas 4,202 at its maximum. The figure as on\r\n\r\n30th  May was 2,545, a decline of sonic-thing like 1,700.  This substantial reduction was principally\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  large  number of  workers  who  have\r\n\r\nregained  employment either  in  new  or  existing\r\n\r\nindustries   under  the  Direction  of  Employment\r\n\r\nScheme  of the Government or who returned to  work\r\n\r\nwhen their former employers resumed production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of money paid up to 30th May\r\n\r\nthis  year  was  $1,438,830.10.  This  amount  was\r\n\r\nshared equally between employers and Government. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second aspect of the Economic Defence\r\n\r\nScheme,  Government tried to find work  for  these\r\n\r\nlaid-off  employees.  To do this,  certain  powers\r\n\r\nwere given to the Director of Economic Defence  to\r\n\r\nrequire specified employers to recruit from  these\r\n\r\nlaid-off workers on the register. In February this\r\n\r\nyear,  the Direction of Employment Scheme was  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation, and the present  position  is  as\r\n\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 4,202 workers who have\r\n\r\npreviously mentioned had received these monthly\r\n\r\nallowances, another 619 were registered for re-employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes. These persons did not qualify  for  the\r\n\r\nallowances   either  because  they  were   casual\r\n\r\nworkers  not attached to any particular  employer\r\n\r\nor they were not engaged in industries which were\r\n\r\ntotally   affected  by  economic   confrontation.\r\n\r\nExamples  of  these  are the water-front  workers\r\n\r\nengaged  in  the Roads traffic of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nHarbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in all the Government was faced with the task\r\n\r\nof  finding  jobs  for 4,821 registered  persons,\r\n\r\nvictims  of Indonesian confrontation one  way  or\r\n\r\nthe  other. It  will  be  noted  that  this   is\r\n\r\nsubstantially  less than the estimate  of  8,200.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this I have already discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the 30th May this year, a total of 2,740\r\n\r\nvacancies  were  notified  to  the  Director   of\r\n\r\nEconomic  Defence.  All  pioneer  industries  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  recruit  their  workers  under  the\r\n\r\nscheme,   as  well  as  all  firms  engaging   50\r\n\r\nemployees  or more each. These are the industries\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Advisory Committee established  under\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Defence (Direction of  Employment)\r\n\r\nOrdinance recommended as suitable for redirection\r\n\r\npurposes.   Public  Authorities  and   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  were  also required  to  notify  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of vacancies in Division IV and  \r\n\r\ndaily-rated   occupations.  Of  the  total   of  \r\n\r\n2,740 vacancies  notified  to the  Department,  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries form the largest group, offering 1,036\r\n\r\njobs.  Government and Statutory  Bodies  reported\r\n\r\n932  jobs.  Private firms offered 708 places  and\r\n\r\nthe Armed Services 114.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of the notified vacancies could not be\r\n\r\nfilled  up  from  the register  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence   Department  because   the   skill   and\r\n\r\nexperience    required   were   not    available.\r\n\r\nExemptions were, therefore, granted in respect of\r\n\r\nthese vacancies and the Department and firms were\r\n\r\nauthorised  to recruit from outside  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe total number of exemptions granted as on 30th\r\n\r\nMay  was  1,045.  This leaves a  total  of  1,745\r\n\r\nvacancies  into  which laid-off  workers  may  be\r\n\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this number, 878 workers have either been\r\n\r\nemployed or are in the process of being employed,\r\n\r\nand  this leaves 867 vacancies still unfilled and\r\n\r\navailable for posting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total figure of 4,821 now on the Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  register  for  employment.  2,177   have\r\n\r\nalready been reemployed or are in the process  of\r\n\r\nbeing   re-employed.   Together   with   unfilled\r\n\r\nvacancies of 867, we get a total of 3,054 jobs as\r\n\r\nagainst 4,821 workers on the register. Therefore,\r\n\r\nas  on  30th  May the position was a  surplus  of\r\n\r\nworkers over jobs in the number of 1,767.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of vacancies notified to the Economic\r\n\r\nDefence Department conies in at the rate of about\r\n\r\n700  a  month of which 450 to 500 may be suitable\r\n\r\nfor employment of persons on the register. At the\r\n\r\nrate  progress is being made, it will not be very\r\n\r\nlong  before all those who could be employed will\r\n\r\nbe absorbed and redirected under the scheme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some observations to make on the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the plan to re-direct  laid-off\r\n\r\nworkers.  This operation has proved  to  be  more\r\n\r\ncomplex than we had expected it to be. It is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to offer the worker any job  anywhere\r\n\r\neven  if he or she is capable of performing  such\r\n\r\nwork,  and  even if the prospective  employer  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to  accept  the  worker.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nimportant question of travelling distance, it  is\r\n\r\nno  good offering a worker living in Sembawang  a\r\n\r\njob  in Jurong if a large slice of his daily  pay\r\n\r\nwill  be absorbed by travelling to and from work.\r\n\r\nSo  even  if  there  are suitable  vacancies  and\r\n\r\nsuitable workers, it is sometimes not possible to\r\n\r\nmatch them together and if the worker refuses for\r\n\r\ngood  reason to take on work offered, it  is  not\r\n\r\nreasonable  to disqualify him from the  financial\r\n\r\nbenefits of the Economic Defence Scheme. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, certain employers are particular\r\n\r\nabout the type of worker they want to engage  in.\r\n\r\nOur  textiles  mills  and the  Garment  factories\r\n\r\ninsist  on engaging young girls and women.  Their\r\n\r\npreference is for those aged between 18 and 21.  We  have  persuaded  them  to  accept  women\r\n\r\nworkers  up  to  the age of 25.  These  employers\r\n\r\nargue  that  the  type  of work  requires  manual\r\n\r\ndexterity     and     a     capacity     to     learn   new   techniques which  are often absent\r\n\r\namong older women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the laid-off workers there are\r\n\r\nunfortunately a large number of them. 850 in  all,\r\n\r\nwho  are  more than 50 years old. It is extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult to place them in new employment as  most\r\n\r\nemployers  want to have younger workers whom  they\r\n\r\ncan  train  and retain in employment  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.  The  problem  of the  older  workers  is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  one and the (Government  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nfind ways and means of resolving it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty in finding places for\r\n\r\nlaid-off  workers  is  a reluctance of  some  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers to come forward for employment. There  are\r\n\r\n486 workers  or  the  register  who  have   been\r\n\r\napproached four times or more and yet have  failed\r\n\r\nto  turn  up  for  interview in  job  registration\r\n\r\nprocess. It is regrettable that these workers have \r\n\r\nmade  no  effort  to cooperate with  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  Scheme in getting alternative employment.\r\n\r\nIf  they  persist in this attitude, there  is  no\r\n\r\nalternative  but to strike them off  the  register\r\n\r\nonce they have received their full payment for the\r\n\r\nsix  months. Because of these workers, it is becom\r\n\r\ning   increasingly  difficult  to  fill  vacancies\r\n\r\nnotified  by  employers.  The  response  rate   of\r\n\r\nworkers  turning  up  for interviews  has  dropped\r\n\r\nrecently  to as low as 12 per cent of all  persons\r\n\r\ncalled  up. Members will agree that it is unreason\r\n\r\nable  to  keep vacancies over a protracted  period\r\n\r\nand  other workers deprived of employment for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  these unco-operative workers  on  the\r\n\r\nDefence Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final observation I want to make relates to\r\n\r\na number of employers who are giving, wittingly or\r\n\r\notherwise, a misleading impression of the work  of\r\n\r\nthe Department. When they receive applications for\r\n\r\nwork, they  reply  to  the applicants  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  offer them work without the permission  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Defence Department. In  fact,  these\r\n\r\nemployers  have  no vacancies  to  offer  hut  the\r\n\r\nregrettable   impression  is  created   that   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  obstructing  the  filling  up   of\r\n\r\nvacancies. As I said before, exemptions  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Ordinance are  freely  granted\r\n\r\nwhen the type of employment is such that there  is\r\n\r\nno suitable candidate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the register and, in fact, more  than  a\r\n\r\nthousand exemptions had so far been granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the damage inflicted on Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy by Indonesian confrontation has been  much\r\n\r\nless  than I had ever dared to hope. In my  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech last year I said that we should be able  to\r\n\r\nmake  good  the  effects of confrontation  in  two\r\n\r\nyears.  As it turned out, this was too pessimistic\r\n\r\na  forecast.  Singapore's economy remains  strong,\r\n\r\nthe  building  boom  goes  on,  and  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   proceeds   with   undiminished\r\n\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to thank all those who\r\n\r\nhave  helped  to make these measures  of  Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  as effective and successful as they  have\r\n\r\nbeen.  The  leaders of The National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress,   the   Chambers   of   Commerce,    the\r\n\r\nManufacturers   Association  and   the   Employers\r\n\r\nFederation  have  rendered invaluable  service  in\r\n\r\nadvising  the Government on important issues.  The\r\n\r\nlarge  body  of workers and employers involved  in\r\n\r\nthis  exercise have displayed an exemplary  public\r\n\r\nspirit  in carrying out the operations. Last,  but\r\n\r\nby no means least, our thanks are due to the small\r\n\r\nbut   dedicated  stall  of  the  Economic  Defence\r\n\r\nDepartment who have carried out new and unfamiliar\r\n\r\ntasks with skill and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Are  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considering  whether  these  so-called\r\n\r\ncasual workers are not worthy of consideration for\r\n\r\nfinancial aid from the Government?

Just ask the Minister the\r\n\r\nquestion so that he can answer it. But the Member\r\n\r\nshould no paraphrase his question with a lengthy\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): `The first\r\n\r\nquestion I wish to ask, of the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nis whether the casual workers on the water-front\r\n\r\nare being considered for any financial aid to be\r\n\r\ngiven by the Government, because their plight is\r\n\r\nvery miserable; and whether the Government is not\r\n\r\nto be held responsible to look after their\r\n\r\ninterests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  said just now that some workers  are\r\n\r\nnot willing to accept jobs offered by the Economic\r\n\r\nDefence  Department. I want to know what  kind  of\r\n\r\nwages they would be able to get out of these  jobs\r\n\r\noffered. Why should they finally reject the  offer\r\n\r\nof these jobs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance has said that some factories have resumed\r\n\r\nproduction after having laid off for some time, or\r\n\r\nsome have changed their form of production. I want\r\n\r\nto know how many of such factories have turned to\r\n\r\nother forms of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The first question with regard\r\n\r\nto  the water-front workers, Mr Speaker. Sir.  On\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading of the Bill, I explained  the\r\n\r\nposition quite clearly. Those who are eligible for\r\n\r\nthis  form  of assistance are those  who  have  an\r\n\r\nemployer, who draw regular income, and who are  on\r\n\r\nthe  pay-roll  of the employer. The employer  pays\r\n\r\nhalf  and  the  Government pays half.  Water-front\r\n\r\nworkers  are casual workers - lighter  men,  lorry\r\n\r\npeople  and  so on. They do not have  any  regular\r\n\r\nemployers  and, therefore, it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\ninclude  them in the scheme. It is not technically\r\n\r\npossible.  Further, because they do not  work  for\r\n\r\nany particular employer, they have no loss of jobs\r\n\r\nbecause  the handling of Indonesian goods is  only\r\n\r\none  portion  of  the total cargo handled  at  the\r\n\r\nwater  front.  There  may well  be  a  decline  of\r\n\r\nincome,  as  indeed  has happened  in  many  other\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  retail business  and  so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  But  there has not been a  total  loss  of\r\n\r\nincome as has taken place in the case of employees\r\n\r\nof  factories  which closed down  because  no  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials were coming from Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is why workers refused\r\n\r\nemployment when it was offered to them. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether there was a slip in translation.  But\r\n\r\nI  said nothing about workers refusing employment.\r\n\r\nWhat I said was this. I had better read the text:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There were some 486 workers who were asked to\r\n\r\nturn  up  at  the Ministry of Labour  and  various\r\n\r\nother recruiting centres to be offered jobs.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>They were asked no less than four times. And they\r\n\r\nnever  turned up at all to consider the jobs  that\r\n\r\nwere  available  to them. Obviously  this  is  not\r\n\r\nquite playing the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is about employers who have\r\n\r\nchanged their line of business. I have no detailed\r\n\r\ninformation  on  this. I do  not  know  whether  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  was  formerly milling low-grade  Indo\r\n\r\nnesian  rubber could, say, turn over to  producing\r\n\r\nhigh-grade  nylon  goods.  I  think  it  is   very\r\n\r\nunlikely.  Obviously if they go into a  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent  line, and if they employ more  than  50\r\n\r\nworkers, they would come within the ambit  of  the Economic Defence Ordinance. But if the Member  has\r\n\r\nany information on this, I should be very glad  to\r\n\r\nreceive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  we  have received complaints  from\r\n\r\nsome  workers who were adversely affected  by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian    economic    confrontation.

The Member should ask his\r\n\r\nquestion straightaway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSonic  workers have been offered jobs far away  from\r\n\r\ntheir place of residence. An example is this: a  man\r\n\r\nliving  in  Jurong has to work in  Sembawang.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this,  he has to incur  heavy  transport\r\n\r\nexpenses.  So  I  want to ask the  Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  any plans to pay them some transport  al\r\n\r\nlowances. This is the first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this: some workers have been\r\n\r\nforced  to  accept  employment  which  they  do  not\r\n\r\nconsider suitable because of distance, low wages  or\r\n\r\nsome  other  reason.  I wish  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether his attention has been drawn to this matter.\r\n\r\nCan he give us a detailed report on this matter? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the   subject  of  transport  allowances   of\r\n\r\nemployees  of private business is not a  ministerial\r\n\r\nresponsibility. It is not the business of Government\r\n\r\nto provide free transport allowances to employees of\r\n\r\nprivate  firms.  But  if the Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\nenough  funds and they want to do public charity.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  employers will be too  delighted  to\r\n\r\nreceive the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about forcing the workers to\r\n\r\ntake  unsuitable jobs. A worker is not compelled  to\r\n\r\naccept  an unsuitable job. If the wages in  the  new\r\n\r\nemployment are less than the amount he is  receiving\r\n\r\nunder economic defence, he has every right to reject\r\n\r\nit  and  to  continue to receive financial  benefit.\r\n\r\nEven  if  it is more than his contribution  but  the\r\n\r\ncost of transport is such as to make it less, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  ask  him  to accept this offer.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Economic Defence has been most  liberal\r\n\r\nand considerate in listening to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers' reasons of why they cannot accept  this  or\r\n\r\nthat  job. But, of course, there is a limit. When  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  job is offered and the transport  cost  is\r\n\r\nnot  high  and the worker still refuses to take  it,\r\n\r\nthen he is laid off from the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Finance has said that  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  837  persons who refuse to go  to  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment. I wish to ask him why they refuse to  go\r\n\r\nto  the  Labour Department for consideration  of  employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: what other remedies is the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considering to offer  such  persons  who\r\n\r\nrefuse to go to the Labour Department? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon.

I  do\r\n\r\nnot  propose  to take this Bill through  to  three\r\n\r\nReadings.  The  purpose  of  the  Certificate   of\r\n\r\nUrgency is in order that the Bill can be committed\r\n\r\nto a Select Committee after the Second Reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, on the 24th of July, in the\r\n\r\nprevious Assembly, we introduced the Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill which\r\n\r\nsought, amongst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  things,  to peg the value  of  land  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired for public purposes to that prevailing on\r\n\r\nthe  1st of January, 1961. Unfortunately,  it  was\r\n\r\nblocked  and it lapsed with the Assembly's dissolution. Consequent on the establishment of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nit is necessary to reconsider the entire question,\r\n\r\nhaving  regard  to  the constitutional  provisions\r\n\r\napplicable throughout Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the 16th of December last year\r\n\r\non   the  Development  Estimates  for  1964,  when\r\n\r\ndebating the question of increased land values and\r\n\r\nthe  cost of land acquisition, I stated two  broad\r\n\r\nprinciples  which  would guide the  Government  in\r\n\r\namending  legislation on the acquisition of  land,\r\n\r\nnamely,  first,  that no private landowner  should\r\n\r\nbenefit from development which had taken place  at\r\n\r\npublic expense: and, secondly, that the price paid\r\n\r\non  the acquisition for public purposes should not\r\n\r\nbe higher than what the land would have been worth\r\n\r\nhad  the  Government not contemplated  development\r\n\r\ngenerally  in the area. I said then that  I  would\r\n\r\nintroduce  legislation which would help to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  increases in land values, because of  public\r\n\r\ndevelopment, should not benefit the landowner, but\r\n\r\nshould benefit the community at large. Land  is  a\r\n\r\nfixed  commodity,  and with mounting  pressure  on\r\n\r\nland  as  a  result  of population  expansion  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment, land values tend inevitably to  rise.\r\n\r\nBut for public purposes of acquisition, we attempt\r\n\r\nin   this  Bill  to  exclude  the  landowner  from\r\n\r\nwindfall gains in increases of land values  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,   first,  of  either  public   expenditure\r\n\r\nalready  incurred  in  the  area,  or  speculative\r\n\r\nincreases  in the price of land in an  area  which\r\n\r\nhas been earmarked for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this No. 2 Amendment Bill includes\r\n\r\nprovisions which embody these two principles.  The\r\n\r\nopportunity  has  also been taken  to  make  other\r\n\r\nchanges in procedural matters and in the manner of\r\n\r\nassessing  compensation by the Collector  of  land\r\n\r\nacquired  for  public purposes. The Bill  proposes\r\n\r\nsubstantial  alterations in  the  law  and  it  is\r\n\r\nintended  now  to refer the Bill to a  Select  Com\r\n\r\nmittee  where  it  can  be considered  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail and where public representations on it  can\r\n\r\nbe received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement of the Bill sets out\r\n\r\nthe contents of the Bill Section 5 of the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance which provided for the\r\n\r\nacquisition of land for public purposes has been\r\n\r\nredrafted to define specifically and enlarge the\r\n\r\nmeaning of \"public purposes\". This redraft, which\r\n\r\nis more specific, follows the Federal Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Act and is considered desirable in\r\n\r\nview of the increasing tempo of public development\r\n\r\nand the need to acquire land for a variety of\r\n\r\npublic purposes, including residential development\r\n\r\nby the Housing and Development Board, industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment by the Economic Development Board, as\r\n\r\nwell as urban renewal of the City as envisaged in\r\n\r\nthe next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance has also provided for a more\r\n\r\nexpeditious procedure of taking possession of\r\n\r\nlands in cases of urgency. For example, in the\r\n\r\ncase of areas devastated by fire, the provisions\r\n\r\nwill enable immediate possession of such lands to\r\n\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major alteration is made in respect of appeals.\r\n\r\nUnder the existing Ordinance, any person\r\n\r\ndissatisfied with an award of the Collector may\r\n\r\nask the Collector to refer the matter to Court.\r\n\r\nAll the consequential administrative-work devolves\r\n\r\non the Land Office and then a single Judge of the\r\n\r\nHigh Court sitting with two assessors decides on\r\n\r\nthe compensation payable in cases where the award\r\n\r\nis not less than $5,000. The amending Bill now\r\n\r\nprovides for an Appeals Board to be presided over\r\n\r\nby a Commissioner of Appeals. The Commissioner\r\n\r\nwill be assisted in certain cases by two assessors\r\n\r\ndrawn from a panel. This Board will deal with ap\r\n\r\npeals on acquisition awards. Appeals to the High\r\n\r\nCourt against the decision of the Board will only\r\n\r\nbe on points of law. These new appeal provisions\r\n\r\nfollow the precedents which have been set in the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom and in Australia of placing\r\n\r\nquestions of this nature involving specialist\r\n\r\nevaluations before administrative tribunals rather\r\n\r\nthan the courts of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the law in regard to the\r\n\r\nassessment   of   compensation  have   also   been\r\n\r\nredrafted. The Bill provides that when  the  value\r\n\r\nof land has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased by reason of development of the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood by provision of roads, drains,\r\n\r\nelectricity, water, gas, sewerage, social,\r\n\r\neducational or recreational facilities by any\r\n\r\npublic or statutory authorities within live years\r\n\r\npreceding the date of the acquisition, such\r\n\r\nincrease shall not be taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we put in provisionally the figure\r\n\r\nof five years prior to date of acquisition, but I\r\n\r\nwould like to state here that it may well be that,\r\n\r\nafter hearing representations from interested\r\n\r\nparties and representations from the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and other development organs of\r\n\r\nthe Government, the preceding number of years may\r\n\r\nhe increased to anywhere between live and 10\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also specifically provided that\r\n\r\ndecreases in value due to encumbrances such as\r\n\r\noccupation by squatters and so on, shall be taken\r\n\r\ninto account in fixing the award. Again, the Bill\r\n\r\nmakes it clear that restrictions imposed under the\r\n\r\nPlanning Ordinance which affects the market value\r\n\r\nof the land shall be taken into account. Another\r\n\r\nmajor change is that a ceiling to market value has\r\n\r\nbeen placed to ensure that the award will not\r\n\r\nexceed the most recent value declared and accepted\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of assessing tax or duty payable\r\n\r\nwhere such declaration has been made within two\r\n\r\nyears of acquisition, or in other cases a\r\n\r\nconsideration of purchase price on its last sale\r\n\r\nor transfer if within two years of the\r\n\r\nacquisition. I think all practising solicitors are\r\n\r\naware that for quite a long time now, valuation\r\n\r\nfor revenue purposes has always been different\r\n\r\nfrom valuation for compensation on acquisition,\r\n\r\nwith the result that there is a disparity between\r\n\r\nwhat the State gets and what the State has to pay.\r\n\r\nThis provision will ensure that when estate duty\r\n\r\nis paid or other assessments are made for revenue\r\n\r\npurposes, a price more approximate to that of the\r\n\r\nmarket value of the land will be entered in the\r\n\r\nestimates. The peril will be that if it were not\r\n\r\nso done, then it is open to the Crown to acquire\r\n\r\nsuch land within two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears of such declaration at the price at which it\r\n\r\nhas been declared for revenue purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change proposed is that interest payable\r\n\r\non the difference between the Collector's award\r\n\r\nand the award ultimately to be decided upon by the\r\n\r\nBoard shall be at the rate of six per cent and not\r\n\r\nas at present - eight per cent. This follows the\r\n\r\nrate payable under the Federation Land Acquisition\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of minor amendments\r\n\r\nconsidered desirable from the administrative point\r\n\r\nof view. They have also been included as well as\r\n\r\ntransitional provisions with regard to\r\n\r\ndeclarations of acquisition of land and references\r\n\r\nto Court made before the coming into operation of\r\n\r\nthis Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of\r\n\r\nMr Speaker as Chairman and six other Members to\r\n\r\nbe nominated by the Committee of Selection. -[The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FORESHORES (AMENDMENT)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI beg to introduce a Bill intituled \"An Ordinance\r\n\r\nto amend the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246 of\r\n\r\nthe Revised Edition).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Second Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

With\r\n\r\nthe rapidly expanding population, the growing pace\r\n\r\nof  public  development, the increasing  tempo  of\r\n\r\nhousing  and  other  public development,  land  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  scarce  and  expensive  commodity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is imperative, therefore,  that  all\r\n\r\navailable land is put to the most advantageous use\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the people of Singapore. Swamp\r\n\r\nand waste land, therefore, has to be reclaimed. So\r\n\r\ntoo  suitable  stretches of  foreshore  along  the\r\n\r\ncoast of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is estimated that 25 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal area of the island of Singapore consists  of\r\n\r\nwaste or swamp land. I have left in the Library of\r\n\r\nthis  House a map of Singapore Island marking  the\r\n\r\nareas  where reclamation is planned. Most of  them\r\n\r\nlie in the northern and western parts of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  mangrove  swamps  could  be  reclaimed  for\r\n\r\neither agricultural or industrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area of 168 acres being reclaimed at\r\n\r\nSungei Poyan for agricultural purposes. Eventually\r\n\r\nsome  900 acres at the Sungei Poyan/Sungei  Berih\r\n\r\narea  will  be  reclaimed by  building  a  dam  at\r\n\r\nTanjong Sekopek over the estuary of the confluence\r\n\r\nwith  a  control gate to prevent intrusion of  sea\r\n\r\nwater   and   to  allow  the  land  reclaimed   to\r\n\r\ndesalinate over a period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same method will be used in Phase II of this\r\n\r\nscheme to reclaim another 300 acres further  south\r\n\r\nof the First Phase in Sungei Bayan/Sungei Pasir on\r\n\r\nthe   northern   side   of  Tanjong   Pasir   Laba\r\n\r\npromontory.  The  total cost  of  this  scheme  is\r\n\r\nestimated at around $1.75 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Third Phase, a further 450 acres will be\r\n\r\nreclaimed in the Sungei Perak area, south  of  the\r\n\r\nSecond Phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  further towards the centre of the island  in\r\n\r\nthe  Kallang  Basin,  an  area  of  387  acres  of\r\n\r\nmangrove swamps and land which go below high  tide\r\n\r\nlevel  is  being reclaimed. A first 32 acres  have\r\n\r\nalready  been established with surplus earth  from\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho  Swee. In Phase I, altogether  some  200\r\n\r\nacres  will  be reclaimed with surplus earth  from\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh and Bukit Ho Swee. There is the problem\r\n\r\nof  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  this  area\r\n\r\ncovering about 89 out of the 200 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Phase, a further 187 acres will be\r\n\r\nreclaimed  with surplus earth from Paya Lebar  and\r\n\r\nUlu Bedok. This project in Kallang Basin will Cost\r\n\r\n$15 million over a period of five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the east coast, a pilot scheme for\r\n\r\nforeshore reclamation has been established, and 48\r\n\r\nacres  of  land reclaimed at Bedok at  a  cost  of\r\n\r\nabout three-quarters of a million dollars. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen successful, and the plan now is to reclaim  a\r\n\r\ntotal area of 1,200 acres from Bedok to Rhu Cross,\r\n\r\nnear  the  end  of the Tanjong Rhu  promontory,  a\r\n\r\ndistance of over six miles extending on an average\r\n\r\nof  one-third of a mile out to sea along the shore\r\n\r\nline.  Earth  from  Siglap Plain  and  the  former\r\n\r\nKatong  Catchment  area will  be  used.  The  land\r\n\r\nreclaimed   will  be  used  for  public   purposes\r\n\r\nincluding an express highway from Bedok to Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu,  public  parks, housing, schools,  and  other\r\n\r\npublic amenities. But it is proposed to set  aside\r\n\r\na  portion  of  this  land reclaimed  for  private\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  In this way, a total cost  of  about\r\n\r\n$48 million, $33 million of which is estimated  to\r\n\r\nbe  required for reclamation work and $15  million\r\n\r\nfor a sea wall, will be in part recovered by sales\r\n\r\nto    private   developers   for   high    quality\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Tanjong Pagar harbour area,\r\n\r\nreclamation is proceeding on a plan to  create  48\r\n\r\nacres of land in the East Lagoon area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation has also increased the area of Pulau\r\n\r\nSemulong, which is now a shipbuilding yard in  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Industrial complex, and the area has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  from  56 acres to 77 acres.  Plans  are\r\n\r\nalso  being  finalised  for reclamation  of  large\r\n\r\nportions of the shore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline  in  the  Jurong harbour area  and  also  of\r\n\r\nSungei Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to achieve this aim of reclaiming\r\n\r\nmore swamp and waste land and the foreshore to\r\n\r\nprovide more land so badly needed in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe Government should not be hampered or hindered\r\n\r\nby elaborate and lengthy procedures with regard\r\n\r\nto reclamations, nor should it be faced with\r\n\r\nclaims for alleged injurious affection and compensation from private landowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreshores (Amendment) Bill has been drafted\r\n\r\nto revise the existing Foreshores Ordinance with\r\n\r\na view to eliminating the elaborate and Iengthy\r\n\r\nprocedure in connection with foreshore\r\n\r\nreclamation and in the assessment of claims for\r\n\r\ncompensation in respect of such foreshore\r\n\r\nreclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provision in this Bill is clause 4\r\n\r\nwhich seeks to repeal section 7 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nrelating to compensation for interference with\r\n\r\npublic or private rights in certain cases, and to\r\n\r\nsubstitute therefor a new section providing that\r\n\r\nthere shall be no compensation as of right in\r\n\r\nrespect of any land or any interest therein\r\n\r\nalleged to have been injuriously affected whether\r\n\r\non account of loss of sea frontage or for any\r\n\r\nother reason by the execution of such reclamation\r\n\r\nworks. However, where the execution of such\r\n\r\nreclamation works has directly caused damage to\r\n\r\nproperty, the Owner may appeal to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor relief, and the Minister is empowered to\r\n\r\norder the payment of compensation or the\r\n\r\nexecution of repairs as are necessary. The\r\n\r\ndecision of the Minister is final.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this new provision, clause 5 of the\r\n\r\nBill repeals sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the\r\n\r\nForeshores Ordinance which lay down lengthy and\r\n\r\nelaborate procedures for notice of foreshore re\r\n\r\nclamation to be given, procedure for determining\r\n\r\nany claims to compensation and the hearing of\r\n\r\nsuch claims. They will now no longer be\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment is clause 3 which provides\r\n\r\nthat the area of land for which the Minister is\r\n\r\nempowered to authorise reclamation would be\r\n\r\nincreased from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none acre outside port limits to ten acres and\r\n\r\nwithin port limits shall be extended from 5,000\r\n\r\nsquare feet to five acres. The existing\r\n\r\nlimitation is unrealistic under the pressure of\r\n\r\nour present land needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses in the Bill need only brief\r\n\r\nmention. Clause 2 provides for permission for the\r\n\r\nerection of any building within 50 feet of any\r\n\r\nforeshore to be approved by the Director of\r\n\r\nPublic Works. At present, the Ordinance limits\r\n\r\nsuch approval to within 50 feet of the bank of\r\n\r\nany port, river or channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is a procedural amendment to provide\r\n\r\nfor only one insertion in the Gazette of the\r\n\r\nsubstance of proposed foreshore leases together\r\n\r\nwith a description of the property to be leased.\r\n\r\nThis makes for expeditiousness by obviating the\r\n\r\nnecessity of having to publish in every issue of\r\n\r\nthe Gazette for a period of three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is urgency in proceeding with land\r\n\r\nreclamation in Singapore. Work which has been\r\n\r\nslowed down will be speeded up with the passage\r\n\r\nof this Bill. Because of expanding population,\r\n\r\nincreasing industrial progress, higher standards\r\n\r\nof Public housing, educational, social and health\r\n\r\nbuildings, and the need for more open spaces, we\r\n\r\nhave to stretch our available land to its\r\n\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have today, Mr Speaker, Sir, introduced two\r\n\r\nother Bills - the Land Acquisition (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill and the Planning (Amendment) Bill - together\r\n\r\nwith this one, and they are based, albeit in an\r\n\r\nimperfect way, on certain allied principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, which\r\n\r\nhas been referred to Select Committee, seeks to\r\n\r\nprevent the Government from having to pay\r\n\r\nenhanced compensation rates when acquiring land\r\n\r\nfor public purposes when the reason for the\r\n\r\nenhanced value has been because of development in\r\n\r\nthe area at public expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Planning (Amendment) Hill provides that\r\n\r\nwhere there is to be an increase in density which\r\n\r\nwill be allowed for building, a premium shall be\r\n\r\npaid. This premium will in part defray the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextra burden on public expenditure as a result of\r\n\r\na higher density of population being allowed\r\n\r\nrequiring in consequence a higher expenditure on\r\n\r\nroads and the solution of traffic problems, the\r\n\r\nlaying on of municipal and other services and\r\n\r\nother public expenditure to cater for more densely\r\n\r\ninhabited areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Foreshores (Amendment) Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nprevent landowners from pursuing outmoded concepts\r\n\r\nof property rights which are no longer valid in\r\n\r\nthe context of public development on public\r\n\r\nexpenditure in present-day Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no foolproof way in\r\n\r\nwhich landowners can be deprived of benefit as a\r\n\r\nresult of public expenditure, for public\r\n\r\nexpenditure unavoidably and inevitably increases\r\n\r\nthe value of land. Sometimes, as in the case of\r\n\r\nthis Foreshores (Amendment) Bill, it is\r\n\r\nconceivable that the value of land may be\r\n\r\ndiminished as a result of loss, for instance, of\r\n\r\nsea frontage. It could, under what we consider to\r\n\r\nbe an archaic concept of property, be claimed that\r\n\r\nif one were accustomed to look across the main\r\n\r\nroad to the sea one would have suffered an\r\n\r\ninjurious affection if looking across the main\r\n\r\nroad some six months later one views not the sea\r\n\r\nbut a park, the sea having receded by a further\r\n\r\nthird of a mile. But even in this case, it is more\r\n\r\nthan probable that any decrease in value as a\r\n\r\nresult of the loss of sea frontage will be offset\r\n\r\nby increased value that will result from the\r\n\r\nbuilding of an express highway from Bedok to Rhu\r\n\r\nCross, providing residents in the area with\r\n\r\nquicker access to the central business district of\r\n\r\nthe city, and also an increase in land value\r\n\r\ngenerally in the area must result in the laying\r\n\r\nout of parks and other public buildings and\r\n\r\namenities on the reclaimed land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of these various amendments is to\r\n\r\nensure,  albeit imperfectly, that the increase  in\r\n\r\nvalue   of  land,  because  of  the  increase   in\r\n\r\npopulation and in development, should not lead  to\r\n\r\nunjust or windfall gains by private landowners and\r\n\r\nspeculators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [The Prime Minister].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AMENDMENT OF STANDING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ORDERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker. I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the amendments\r\n\r\nset  out  in  Appendix  I to  the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders Committee as contained  in  Paper\r\n\r\nL.A.  I  of  1964 be and are hereby  made  to  the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendments which have been\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for  consideration in this  House  have\r\n\r\nbeen  arrived at from the light of our  experience\r\n\r\nduring  the past five years in the last  Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our hope that the changes proposed in  the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders will facilitate the proceedings in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, and will also assist Mr  Speaker, who is in the Chair, in the conduct of proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any charge anywhere that democratic\r\n\r\nrights are being curtailed, I would like to refute\r\n\r\nit  by  stating quite categorically that democracy\r\n\r\nis  best preserved by not reducing the proceedings\r\n\r\nin  this  House  to those of a comic  opera  or  a\r\n\r\ncircus. Unfortunately on certain occasions in  the\r\n\r\npast,  this  House  had  to  endure  very  lengthy\r\n\r\nrepetitious speeches which Mr Speaker was  unable\r\n\r\nto  terminate. In spite of Standing Order  No.  54\r\n\r\nrelating  to repetition of speeches, the  Chairman\r\n\r\nhad  always in the past found it difficult indeed,\r\n\r\nespecially  when speeches were made in a  language\r\n\r\nforeign   to   the  Chairman,  to  terminate   the\r\n\r\nrepetition.  The result, of course, was  that  50\r\n\r\nMembers in this House had to tolerate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the principal changes proposed in this\r\n\r\nReport are that in future, the debate on the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara's Speech  and  on  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's Budget Speech will be limited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespectively to five days. In the case of the\r\n\r\nBudget Speech, there is a one-day debate on the\r\n\r\nSpeech itself and three days are allocated for\r\n\r\ndebate on the Main Estimates and one day on the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates. This gives a total of five\r\n\r\ndays' speaking time on the Government's Budget for\r\n\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's Speech, it has been found from past\r\n\r\nexperience - in fact, at the last sitting of the\r\n\r\nAssembly - that it took only four days. However, it\r\n\r\nis our intention to increase this period by one\r\n\r\nfurther day to allow Back-benchers to make their\r\n\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the time and manner of speaking as\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in  Standing Order No. 43.  Speeches  to\r\n\r\nquestions  by the Chair will now be limited  to  not\r\n\r\nmore  than one hour. However, a Member who  moves  a\r\n\r\nmotion  can extend his speech by 15 minutes  if  the\r\n\r\nHouse  so  allows and he is also permitted to  close\r\n\r\nthe debate by a speech lasting for not more than one\r\n\r\nhour.  In  Committee, a Member will be permitted  to\r\n\r\nspeak  for  15 minutes. This is so, because  in  Committee, as Members in the House are aware, a  Member\r\n\r\ncan  stand up again and again to raise questions  or\r\n\r\nto  make  further points on questions that  are  dis\r\n\r\ncussed. Therefore, it would be tedious indeed if  in\r\n\r\nCommittee  a Member were allowed to speak  for  more\r\n\r\nthan 15 minutes at a stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, may I also draw the attention of\r\n\r\nMembers  to the practice which is being carried  out\r\n\r\nin  other Parliaments? There is a footnote to  Stand\r\n\r\ning  Order No. 43, which explains that in Nigeria  a\r\n\r\nMember  is permitted to speak for not more  than  30\r\n\r\nminutes  on  any subject, but that  a  mover  of  an\r\n\r\noriginal  motion  is  entitled  to  45  minutes.  In\r\n\r\nAustralia  the times vary considerably. A Member  is\r\n\r\npermitted to speak for only 25 minutes if the debate\r\n\r\nis on the Address of Thanks by the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nIn moving the Second Reading of a Bill, the Minister\r\n\r\nis permitted a 45-minute period and any other Member\r\n\r\nwho  wishes  to speak on the question  is  permitted\r\n\r\nonly 30 minutes. In other debates,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nthat is to say, on motions moved by any other\r\n\r\nMember  of the House, the mover has only 30  minutes\r\n\r\nand other Members have only 20 minutes. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nin  Committee of Supply a Member is entitled to only\r\n\r\ntwo  periods of 10 minutes each. That,  of  course,\r\n\r\nmeans that the Member can, speak altogether for only\r\n\r\n20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I hope, Mr Speaker, will be a happy\r\n\r\ncompromise which will enable as many Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse - 51 Members - to be allocated the time to make\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches.  Previously  we  have  had  Members\r\n\r\nstanding  up in this Chamber regorgitating  speeches\r\n\r\nwritten  for  them by somebody else  and  the  whole\r\n\r\nperiod lasting seven hours. Very often sittings  had\r\n\r\nto  be  extended  to past midnight  and  there  were\r\n\r\noccasions  when  many Members  of  this  House  were\r\n\r\nabsent  while a Member was spouting out  his  speech\r\n\r\nfrom  his  script  and Mr Speaker had  considerable\r\n\r\ntrouble  even  to  find a quorum.  Well,  it  is  to\r\n\r\neliminate  this abuse of freedom of speech  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  that  we have come to this  arrangement  in\r\n\r\nthis  Standing Order No. 43. I would also  add  that\r\n\r\nany  Member in this Chamber who has anything of real\r\n\r\nvalue  to say should be able to find one hour  quite\r\n\r\nadequate  to  put his point across, it is  to  avoid\r\n\r\ntedious  repetitions and diversions that  this  time\r\n\r\nlimit has been imposed. In fact, those who have ever\r\n\r\nbeen students before are aware that they can stand a\r\n\r\nteacher's  lecture for at the most  only  one  hour.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  do not consider ourselves to be still  in\r\n\r\nclass, I feel that the majority of us would consider\r\n\r\nthat one hour is sufficiently adequate to listen  to\r\n\r\na  Member's speech and if he has anything worthy  of\r\n\r\nnote,  he could put it in within the period  of  one\r\n\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Standing Order No. 18 relating to questions\r\n\r\nto  be  answered  in  the House,  a  Member  is  now\r\n\r\nrationed  to three questions per day. Question  time\r\n\r\nwill  be  limited  altogether to  one  hour,  so  no\r\n\r\nquestions will be taken after half-past 3 p.m. Again\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  this,  may  I draw  the  attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers to the footnote under Standing Order No.  18\r\n\r\nwhich  explains the practice in other Parliaments -\r\n\r\nin the House of Commons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in the Dewan Raayat in Kuala Lumpur? The number\r\n\r\nof questions is limited to two and three to each Mem\r\n\r\nber  respectively; and furthermore Question Time  is\r\n\r\nalso  limited to one hour. However, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  questions  which have been introduced  on  the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper  for  answer and which  have  not  been\r\n\r\ndisposed  of  will not be answered at  all.  On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  if a Member so wishes he can  inform  the\r\n\r\nClerk  of the Assembly or Mr Speaker that he wishes\r\n\r\nthese  questions which have not been taken  by  3.30\r\n\r\np.m. to be taken the following day. This, of course,\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that supplementary questions  to  the\r\n\r\nmain  question will be prohibited. Members can still\r\n\r\nask supplementary questions to the main question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these are the principal amendments\r\n\r\nwhich   the  Standing  Orders  Committee  have   put\r\n\r\nforward. I may end up by stating to the House  that,\r\n\r\nas  far as the Government is concerned, we find that\r\n\r\nwe  should devote more time to the administration of\r\n\r\nour  duties  and that the welfare of  the  State  is\r\n\r\nbetter guarded if the Government were to devote more\r\n\r\nof  its time to administration. I have no doubt that\r\n\r\nwe  will  come  to  this  House  now  and  then  for\r\n\r\nlegislation or for clarification of certain policies\r\n\r\nwhich  have been carried out, but it certainly would\r\n\r\nnot  be  to the welfare of the State if we  were  to\r\n\r\nspend  most  of  our  time squatting  in  this  cold\r\n\r\nChamber  when we could do more concrete and positive\r\n\r\nwork carrying out administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nunder the pretext of facilitating the Speaker's work\r\n\r\nand  streamlining the proceedings of this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe present Standing Orders which have been modelled\r\n\r\non  the  legislatures  of  other  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Commonwealth have been revised and will  be\r\n\r\npassed  at  today's  sitting.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I  have  no  better\r\n\r\nevidence  than the last few sentences in the  speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Deputy  Prime Minister where  he  admitted,\r\n\r\nopenly  and  nakedly, that the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  waste time debating in this Assembly,  but\r\n\r\nwishes  to  concentrate all its energy and  time  in\r\n\r\ndealing with administration. In other words,  if  it\r\n\r\nis  possible,  the Government wishes to  concentrate\r\n\r\n365  days  a  year in executive work  and  does  not\r\n\r\nbother  to  waste  even one day in  the  Legislature\r\n\r\nexcept  when  it  has to conic  back  here  to  pass\r\n\r\ncertain laws like the Land Acquisition Ordinance and\r\n\r\nthe Foreshores Ordinance on a Certificate of Urgency ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We  are bound by a bigger  framework,  by\r\n\r\nanother bigger constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sittings of this Assembly are now very rare\r\n\r\noccurrences. As a matter of fact, the cushions  here ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Moth-eaten!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b>--- very soon will have cobwebs.\r\n\r\nPeople have forgotten the existence of this Assembly.\r\n\r\nNow with the revised Standing Orders passed, whatever\r\n\r\nlittle remnants of democracy and free speech left will\r\n\r\nhe corroded even more and more. In the days of the\r\n\r\ncolonial regime, the Standing Orders of the\r\n\r\nLegislatures were admittedly more free and democratic ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> So you prefer the colonial days?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Of course, it is admitted that the\r\n\r\ncolonial  masters  controlled  the  speeches  of  their\r\n\r\nnominated Assemblymen, not through restrictive Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  but through nominating stooges. But now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Government has not yet gone over to either  a\r\n\r\nguided democracy or to a totalitarian regime like  some\r\n\r\nother  countries, it is not yet possible  for  them  to\r\n\r\nnominate  stooges  who  read out speeches  dictated  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Therefore, Sir, we have today  this  gross\r\n\r\ndeparture  from  the  parliamentary  system,  the  most\r\n\r\nrestrictive  Standing Orders yet to  be  found  in  the\r\n\r\nBritish   Commonwealth.  These  Standing   Orders,   if\r\n\r\nadopted,  will  make democracy a farce. The  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  abolish  the  Assembly  altogether  at  present\r\n\r\nbecause of the Federal Constitution, or either fill  it\r\n\r\nwith nominated Members. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat the Government is scared of. Is it because of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation deteriorating clay by day?  We  can\r\n\r\nestimate  more  than 100,000 people unemployed  cursing\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  The Government  are  very  scared  of\r\n\r\ncriticism  for fear that the lid on the cauldron  which\r\n\r\nthey are sitting on will blow off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to these amendments. They fall under\r\n\r\nseveral categories although the objective is the  same.\r\n\r\nHaving   no   power  to  abolish  this  Assembly,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment have to consider what is the next best thing\r\n\r\nto  do.  They will be adopting revised Standing Orders.\r\n\r\nDays   of  notices  of  sittings  will  be  drastically\r\n\r\nreduced.  Times  for debate on the Government's  policy\r\n\r\nspeech and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannual  Budget are curtailed.

Mr Speaker, Sir, very soon we will have  to\r\n\r\napply  for  coupons  to speak from the  Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse. Every Member cannot speak for more than one hour\r\n\r\nin the House or 15 minutes in Committee stage. The majority in the Assembly, which means the Government Party,\r\n\r\nhowever, can do many things as it wishes. By the use of\r\n\r\nits   majority  vote,  there  will  be  two  types   of\r\n\r\nprocedures,  one  for  the majority  aid  one  for  the\r\n\r\nminority.  It  is in similar vein. Sir, where  a  Party\r\n\r\npractices Right-wing policies in Singapore hut seeks to\r\n\r\ndemand Left-wing social reforms and winds of change  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  or  like  protecting  expatriates   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and opposing expatriates in the  Federation;\r\n\r\nor  like suppressing and trampling the workers'  rights\r\n\r\nin Singapore and asking for more pay for the workers in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation;  by  suppressing  all   remnants   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  Singapore and asking for more  democracy\r\n\r\nand  more freedom of speech in the Federation. It is  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  vein,  Sir,  that we will  have,  through  the\r\n\r\nmajority vote, two types of democracy in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  usual double-faced policy and the  supreme\r\n\r\nfact  for  us is that Singapore is only a State  within\r\n\r\nthe Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope time is not up yet because\r\n\r\nthe new Standing Orders have not et conic into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

In one of the explanatory statements,\r\n\r\nit  is stated that to punish a Member by suspension  or\r\n\r\notherwise  can  be  moved as a  matter  of  course  and\r\n\r\nwithout  notice. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is  D-Day  not\r\n\r\nforward, but backward for this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Party in power propose to amend the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders of this House for their own reasons. We\r\n\r\nhave made a careful study of the amendments and we can\r\n\r\nunderstand the reasons advanced by them. They are meant\r\n\r\nto destroy parliamentary democracy here, and these\r\n\r\nreasons are to cover up their intentions. Their main\r\n\r\npurpose is to curb the opportunity for Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers of making speeches and to prevent us from\r\n\r\npreparing our speeches. On the other hand, they try to\r\n\r\ngive more time and opportunity to Ministers and\r\n\r\nBackbenchers to make speeches in order to attack\r\n\r\nOpposition Members. Those are the main reasons for\r\n\r\nmaking these amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Standing Order 43 (8)\r\n\r\n(a)  and (b) - it stipulates that any Member making a\r\n\r\nspeech is limited to one hour, and in Committee the\r\n\r\ntime allowed is 15 minutes for each Member. This\r\n\r\nundoubtedly threatens our opportunity to make speeches\r\n\r\nand curbs the content of our speeches. Of course, the\r\n\r\nParty in power will say that the same provision is\r\n\r\napplicable to Government Benchers so that there will\r\n\r\nnot be any injustice to the Opposition. But we would\r\n\r\npoint out that this kind of stipulation is contrary to\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, because Parliament is the\r\n\r\nhighest institution where the wishes of the people can\r\n\r\nhe expressed. It is a place where State affairs and\r\n\r\nimportant public matters can be discussed. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe Standing Orders of this House should not be amended\r\n\r\nwithout any good reasons. Members should be given ample\r\n\r\ntime to represent the people in their speeches.\r\n\r\nOpposition Members should be given the opportunity to\r\n\r\ncheck the Government. But now the Government intend to\r\n\r\nlimit our opportunity for making speeches. This is\r\n\r\ncontrary to parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see that under certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances the Ministers can make speeches without\r\n\r\nany restriction. For instance, under Standing Order 83,\r\n\r\nparagraph (2), the Minister for Finance is not bound by\r\n\r\nthe provisions of Standing Order 43. And also the mover\r\n\r\nof the motion to debate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and the Member making a\r\n\r\nreply are given ample time to make their speeches. From\r\n\r\nthese amendments we can see that the Party in power are\r\n\r\nlimiting  the  time of the Opposition.  Under  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  13 the time of notice of debate of one week  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced to two days. This means that  three  days\r\n\r\nafter  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has  delivered  his\r\n\r\nspeech,  the  Party in power can convene a  sitting  to\r\n\r\ndebate  the speech. Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy speech\r\n\r\nis a very important statement of the Government for the\r\n\r\nwhole  year.  We  would like to ask whether  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  can gather the necessary material  in  such  a\r\n\r\nshort  period of two days for a debate in  this  House.\r\n\r\nThe  Opposition  thus cannot have  sufficient  time  to\r\n\r\nstudy  deeply  the policy statement and therefore  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to make effective criticisms  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another undemocratic amendment. It relates to\r\n\r\nthe   reduction  of  time  for  debate  on  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  Formerly the time allocated was five  days,\r\n\r\nbut  flow the time is limited to three days' debate  on\r\n\r\nthe   Main  Estimates  and  one  day's  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the various items of revenue for the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments come from the people. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  people have a right to know and to discuss the use\r\n\r\nof  these  monies.  Therefore, the time  limit  on  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the Estimates will mean that Opposition  Mem\r\n\r\nbers will be prevented from making full use of the time\r\n\r\nto  criticise  the  Government and  to  study  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is making use of public funds.  The  people\r\n\r\nwill then suffer. Thus the reduction of time amounts to\r\n\r\na  reduction of the right of the Opposition Members  to\r\n\r\nmake their speeches here. Today we represent the people\r\n\r\nin this House, and if we cannot have sufficient time to\r\n\r\nmake speeches as their representatives, then it is  not\r\n\r\nonly  a loss to us Opposition Members, but also a  loss\r\n\r\nof  the  democratic rights of the people. As Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers,  we  have the responsibility to safeguard  the\r\n\r\nrights  of the people and to prevent these rights  from\r\n\r\nbeing abused by the Party in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since I received the revised Standing Orders of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  after  deep  thought and  study  of  these\r\n\r\namendments  to the Standing Orders.  I  find  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  improper and unreasonable. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  intended  to curb the  freedom  and  opportunity to raise effective criticism against the\r\n\r\ngovernment,  thus  turning these  Standing  Orders\r\n\r\ninto  something beneficial for the Government.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  they limit the Opposition  from\r\n\r\neffectively  criticising  all  the  measures   and\r\n\r\npolicies  put  forward  by  the  Government.   The\r\n\r\nquestions  discussed in this  House  involve  very\r\n\r\ngrave State matters and other important issues and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  Opposition should be  given  ample\r\n\r\nopportunity to study and criticise these policies.\r\n\r\nThe  amendments  to the Standing Orders,  however,\r\n\r\nare  contrary to the spirit of democracy. This  is\r\n\r\nanother sign that the Government arc becoming more\r\n\r\nand  more dictatorial. They are motivated by their\r\n\r\nown selfishness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the revised Standing Orders, the time for\r\n\r\ngiving notice has been reduced, while the time  of\r\n\r\nnotice  required  from  the  Opposition  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased.  This  shows that  the  Government  are\r\n\r\nmaking use of these provisions in order to prevent\r\n\r\nthe Opposition from having ample time to study all\r\n\r\nissues. This is a grave blow to the people. It  is\r\n\r\nalso   an   insult  and  a  smear  to   democratic\r\n\r\nprinciples. The revised Standing Orders are  unreasonable and disadvantageous to the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with these amendments in great\r\n\r\ndetail,  in Standing Order 13, firstly,  the  time\r\n\r\nfor  debate  on the policy speech. Previously  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  gave seven days to the  Opposition  to\r\n\r\nstudy  the  policy speech. But now the  number  of\r\n\r\ndays  has  been reduced to two. The policy  speech\r\n\r\nembodies  all  the  important  measures   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   other   complicated   problems.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should have ample time to study  the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech. To make matters worse, we are  not\r\n\r\nable  to  get all the necessary data to study  it.\r\n\r\nThe  Government have been unco-operative  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  We are given a very short time  to  make\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary preparation for the debate on the policy\r\n\r\nspeech. We are not able to devote sufficient  time\r\n\r\non  important  questions embodied  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on new\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 43, paragraph (8). In  the  old\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders, there was no limitation  on  the\r\n\r\ntime  to  speak to any question. But  in  the  new\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders, provision is made to  limit  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  Opposition  Members  to  speak  to   any\r\n\r\nquestion. A Member is entitled to speak  for  only\r\n\r\none hour. He can have another 15 minutes if the majority  of  Members  give their  assent.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother  example  of the Government's  dictatorial\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Parliament is bigger than our State\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly. Yet there is no  limitation\r\n\r\non  the time given to the Members there. To  limit\r\n\r\nthe  time of the Members will not only mean a loss\r\n\r\nto  them,  but also a great loss to the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nBecause   of  the  limitation  of  time.  Members,\r\n\r\nespecially  the Opposition Members,  will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to voice the views of the people. They  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to point out the faulty measures  of\r\n\r\nthe Government. The Opposition Parties cannot play\r\n\r\nan   effective  role  as  representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Standing Orders are\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous to the Opposition Parties in  that\r\n\r\nthey   will  not  allow  the  Opposition   Parties\r\n\r\nsufficient time to criticise the wrong policies or\r\n\r\nmeasures  of  the Government. They  criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because they want it to adopt  correct\r\n\r\npolicies  and  to  pursue the  correct  line.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  the Government curb the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nfrom exercising their duties? Why should they stop\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Parties from pointing  out  their\r\n\r\nfaults and shortcomings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old Standing Order 63, paragraph (2), any\r\n\r\nMember who wishes to introduce a Bill should  give\r\n\r\ntwo  clear  days' notice. But in the new  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder,  a  private Member should give  four  clear\r\n\r\ndays'  notice. That means he has to give two  more\r\n\r\nclear  days'  notice.  This only  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is trying to lengthen the time of notice of\r\n\r\na  motion.  The  Government want  to  deprive  the\r\n\r\nOpposition of the opportunity to raise questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Standing Order No. 83, paragraph (2), the\r\n\r\nMinister  will not be bound by Standing Order  No.\r\n\r\n43  (8).  The  Standing Orders should  be  applied\r\n\r\nequally to the Opposition Parties as well  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. There should not be two standards.  In\r\n\r\nthe  new  Standing Orders, the Minister is enabled\r\n\r\nto extend the time of his speech. This dictatorial\r\n\r\npractice  and  attitude can only mean  that  there\r\n\r\nwould not be any democratic spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old Standing Order 86 (2), 5 days was\r\n\r\nallotted for the debate on the Main Estimates. But\r\n\r\nnow  the number of days has been reduced to three.\r\n\r\nThe  Main Estimates are very important. They  need\r\n\r\nour  careful study. Thus the time provided by  the\r\n\r\nnew Standing Order is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the amended Standing Order 87 (2), there is\r\n\r\nonly   one  day  for  debate  on  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.   Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates involve the economic livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   and  all  other  constructive   measures.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  one  day allotted to  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates will not be sufficient. If it is devoted\r\n\r\nto  jesting and talking nonsense, of course, it is\r\n\r\nsufficient.  But  if we are really  to  study  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates,  then  one  day   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to talk on the details of the\r\n\r\namendments. But from the amendment of this major\r\n\r\nStanding Order, viewed generally, we can only come\r\n\r\nto the conclusion that the Government want to\r\n\r\ncontrol the Legislature. Freedom of speech has\r\n\r\nalready been limited. But by this amendment the\r\n\r\nGovernment can have a hand in further curbing\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy and freedom of speech. The\r\n\r\nreal intention of this amendment is to preserve\r\n\r\nthe Government's monopolistic rights, to allow\r\n\r\nthemselves all the conveniences but to deny to\r\n\r\nothers their rights in this House. This is a great\r\n\r\ndeparture from parliamentary democracy. It is an\r\n\r\ninsult to the principle of democracy. These\r\n\r\ndictatorial and monopolistic tactics and intrigues\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. should be strongly condemned. Any\r\n\r\nline taken, any policy and actions of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwhich are contrary to the interest and welfare of\r\n\r\nthe people and which curb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  freedom and their democratic rights, should\r\n\r\nbe strongly condemned by all the people concerned.\r\n\r\nThey are a detriment to democracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the speeches of the three  Members\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Opposition side took in  all  about  20\r\n\r\nminutes.  This indicates that what the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  tried  to do, that is, to amend the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  to give Members one hour to speak is  more\r\n\r\nthan  ample  and  justified. Of  course,  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly we are all representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nWe are here to discuss the interests affecting the\r\n\r\nState.  But  it is not for them to make  publicity\r\n\r\nfor their Jakarta Press. I do not see any logic in\r\n\r\ntheir argument. In amending the Standing Order  to\r\n\r\nlimit the time of speaking to one hour, it affects\r\n\r\nboth  sides of the House. It does not affect  only\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Members.

They  each  spent  ten\r\n\r\nminutes  trying to prove to us that unless Members\r\n\r\nare allowed to speak for more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan one hour each, there is no democracy. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim pleaded that unless Members are allowed to\r\n\r\nspeak for more than one hour, there is no democracy,\r\n\r\nand yet he was satisfied making his point within the\r\n\r\nspace of ten minutes. The Member for Bukit Merah spoke\r\n\r\nin a similar vein. The exception was the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar. He decided to exercise his democratic\r\n\r\nrights by speaking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the gist of their arguments is this. If you\r\n\r\nspeak for one hour or less, then there is less\r\n\r\ndemocracy. If you speak for two hours, then there is\r\n\r\nmore democracy. If you can speak for three hours, then\r\n\r\nthere is still more democracy. That is their measure of\r\n\r\ndemocracy on this earth. The longer you can speak, the\r\n\r\nmore democracy there is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to try to convince them that, in fact, by\r\n\r\nallowing a Member unlimited time to speak in this\r\n\r\nAssembly, they are curtailing the democratic rights of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly. Their former leader, Dr Lee Siew Choh,\r\n\r\nas we all know, was in the habit of making speeches for\r\n\r\nseven or eight hours starting in the evening right\r\n\r\nthrough to the small hours of the next day. What\r\n\r\nhappened was that for the whole day - a day and a night -\r\n\r\nonly Dr Lee Siew Choh could speak in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe other 50 Members did not have a chance to speak.\r\n\r\nAnd that they say is democracy! I say, Sir, that our\r\n\r\nStanding Orders by limiting the length of individual\r\n\r\nspeeches to one hour or less provide more democracy,\r\n\r\nbecause where previously only one man could speak\r\n\r\nthroughout the day, under the new Standing Orders,\r\n\r\nfive, six, seven, eight or more Members in this\r\n\r\nAssembly can speak. So I say that there is more freedom\r\n\r\nof speech, because you give the right of speech to a\r\n\r\nlarger number of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am told that the word\r\n\r\n\"hypocritical\" is out of order. So I say that it is\r\n\r\ninsincere for people like Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis to shed crocodile tears over democracy here.\r\n\r\nThey do not believe in democracy. There is a man whom\r\n\r\nthey are supporting -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir supreme leader - and if the Standing Orders\r\n\r\nof Indonesia are implemented in this Assembly, there\r\n\r\nwill be only one supreme speaker!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in this Assembly, freedom of speech is not\r\n\r\nmeasured by how long you can speak. The three Members\r\n\r\nopposite have shown that if you want to make a point\r\n\r\neffectively, you can make it within half an hour or\r\n\r\nwithin ten to fifteen minutes. In fact, it is my\r\n\r\ncontention, Sir, that perhaps by limiting speeches to\r\n\r\ntolerable proportions, we are doing the Opposition a\r\n\r\nfavour, because some of them within the course of 15\r\n\r\nminutes speak a lot of rubbish. If they are given three\r\n\r\nhours, they will speak more rubbish and to that extent\r\n\r\nthey will do more damage to their own cause. Dr Lee\r\n\r\nSiew Choh, the man who spoke for eight to ten hours, is\r\n\r\nnow out of this Assembly. The only former Member of the\r\n\r\nBarisan who has survived is the man who talks least\r\n\r\n- the Member for Jalan Kayu. It proves our point that\r\n\r\nit is better to speak sense for 15 minutes or half an\r\n\r\nhour than to speak rubbish for eight or nine hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, none of the speakers in the Opposition have\r\n\r\nindicated in what way, apart from cutting down the\r\n\r\nlength of time, these Standing Orders limit freedom of\r\n\r\nspeech. Does the fact that you are speaking for only\r\n\r\none hour limit free speech? In what way is this\r\n\r\nundemocratic? I think the Member for Hong Lim said,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is the beginning of a one-Party State.\" This\r\n\r\nis odd, coming from a one-man Party. And yet, under\r\n\r\nthese Standing Orders, if the Member for Hong Lim is\r\n\r\nstill in this Assembly, he can speak. It does not\r\n\r\nconstitute a one-Party State. He is allowed to speak\r\n\r\nand make his point. He has not indicated in what way\r\n\r\nthese Standing Orders make for totalitarian rule. Many\r\n\r\nof these Standing Orders have precedents in Nigeria and\r\n\r\nAustralia. Is it suggested that these are undemocratic\r\n\r\nStates, or is it suggested that the only democratic\r\n\r\nState which appeals to the political loyalty of the\r\n\r\ngentlemen opposite is a one-Party State like Soviet\r\n\r\nRussia or Indonesia? Are those countries their models\r\n\r\nof democracy, where you have a one-Party State and only\r\n\r\none man can speak? Or is it in an Assembly like this or\r\n\r\nin Australia or in Nigeria or in the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya, where you are allowed to speak? The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  of these Standing Orders - as the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has pointed out -  is  to  prevent\r\n\r\nabuse  of the privileges accorded in this Chamber,\r\n\r\nby  Members  using the Assembly to  prevent  other\r\n\r\nMembers from speaking. That was what happened. The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members, though they constituted\r\n\r\na small group, deliberately came into this Chamber\r\n\r\nand   made  long  repetitious  speeches.  You  may\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir - at least I remember - that  when\r\n\r\nDr Lee Siew Choh and other Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis got up to speak, there used to be a relay\r\n\r\nof  runners who came into this Chamber with a  wad\r\n\r\nof  notes to keep them fed with ideas. So much  so\r\n\r\nthat  it  became  tedious,  and  Members  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber had to seek refuge in the C.P.A. Room when\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  Siew Choh was speaking. It was the  same\r\n\r\ncase  when the other Barisan Sosialis Members were\r\n\r\nspeaking  -  some  Members went to  sleep  in  the\r\n\r\nC.P.A. Room. Far from ensuring that there was real\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  what  happened was  that  by  allowing\r\n\r\nMembers  to make tedious speeches, other  Members,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Barisan Sosialis supporters,  were\r\n\r\nforced to leave the Chamber in order to escape the\r\n\r\nverbal  diarrhoea of Dr Lee Siew Choh who  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger the Chairman of the Gentlemen opposite.  So\r\n\r\nit  is  to  prevent  this kind  of  abuse  of  the\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  this Chamber that  these  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders are being introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention to prevent the Opposition\r\n\r\nfrom  speaking.  These  Standing  Orders  do   not\r\n\r\nprevent the Opposition Members from speaking. They\r\n\r\nonly    preventthe    Opposition    from    making\r\n\r\nunnecessarily lengthy speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I just illustrate that\r\n\r\nthe  best  way to make effective criticism  -  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   we   know  want  to  make   effective\r\n\r\ncriticism - is by saying what you have to  say  in\r\n\r\nas  few words as possible? This reminds me of  the\r\n\r\nfishmonger  who  put up a sign  outside  his  shop\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Fresh Fish Sold Here\". A gentleman  came\r\n\r\nalong and asked him, \"Why do you say that? You are\r\n\r\nobviously selling fresh fish; so why not  cut  out\r\n\r\nthe  word `fresh'?\" So the sign became \"Fish  Sold\r\n\r\nHere\". On the second day, another chap came  along\r\n\r\nand  told the fishmonger, \"Obviously you  are  not\r\n\r\ngiving your fish away. You know, you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare selling your fish. Cut out the `Sold' and just\r\n\r\nput  `Fish Here'.\" On the third day, another  chap\r\n\r\ncame  along  and asked, \"Why do you put  the  word\r\n\r\n`here'?  Obviously you can see that  the  fish  is\r\n\r\nhere.  So cut out the word `here'.\" On the  fourth\r\n\r\nday,  another chap came along and said, \"You know,\r\n\r\nyour  fish smells so much after the fifth day that\r\n\r\nI  can  smell it down the street. So cut  out  the\r\n\r\nword `Fish'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my humble suggestion to the Members of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis opposite that there are times\r\n\r\nwhen it is not necessary for them to say anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that making speeches is a very important aspect in the\r\n\r\nlife  of  an Assemblyman who is the representative\r\n\r\nof  the people. If we do not speak a word in  this\r\n\r\nChamber,   then,  of  course,  we   will   receive\r\n\r\ncriticism  from the people. But one must  consider\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of speeches one is going to  make.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have certain principles to govern the making\r\n\r\nof  speeches in this Chamber. We cannot just  come\r\n\r\nhere and talk nonsense and waste time. There is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  proverb which says, \"To govern  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  to  speak a lot.\" In other words,  statesmen\r\n\r\nand  politicians  should  not  resort  to  flowery\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  lengthy  speeches  to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They must resort to action. They must  be\r\n\r\njudged by their deeds and not by their words.  But\r\n\r\nthe Members of the Opposition are complaining that\r\n\r\nthey  are not being given sufficient time to speak\r\n\r\ntheir  minds and express their views as adequately\r\n\r\nas  possible.  I  think they are  not  correct  in\r\n\r\nmaking  such  a complaint because one  cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  longer he speaks the better he  is.  It\r\n\r\ndoes not mean that Members of this House must come\r\n\r\nhere  to  compete with one another to see who  can\r\n\r\nspeak  longer or better. My opinion  is  that  the\r\n\r\nbest policy i to speak concisely. In other words,\r\n\r\nif  you can speak in fewer words and express  your\r\n\r\nideas   that  are  constructive,  then  you  speak\r\n\r\ncorrectly and well. A speech is not judged by  the\r\n\r\nnumber of words therein but by its content. If you\r\n\r\nwant to defend the democratic system, then, in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, you must not resort to speaking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor one, two, three or more hours. That is not the\r\n\r\nway  to defend democratic rights. It does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  when  you speak for one hour less  you  will\r\n\r\nhave  less democratic rights. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nthere is nothing in this world, especially in such\r\n\r\na  small  island  as  Singapore,  that  cannot  be\r\n\r\nexpressed concisely and precisely and finished off\r\n\r\nin  one  hour.  You can, in fact,  deal  with  any\r\n\r\nmatter  within  the  limit of  one  hour  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  No one can claim that they have  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  knowledge of every matter  relating\r\n\r\nto  every Ministry. It is impossible for one to be\r\n\r\na  know-all. So the Opposition should resort to  a\r\n\r\ndivision  of  labour. This means that they  should\r\n\r\nallocate topics to be dealt with in their speeches\r\n\r\namong  themselves,  so that one  speaker  will  be\r\n\r\nallocated  a certain section and a certain  topic.\r\n\r\nSo what matters is not whether you speak longer or\r\n\r\nshorter. The crux of the matter is whether you can\r\n\r\ngo  straight  to  the  point of  the  topic  under\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not resort to the endless gossiping of\r\n\r\nan  old  lady. If you do so, then you will be  the\r\n\r\nmost unwelcomed Member in this House, and you will\r\n\r\nbe  considered a long-winded gossip. One must  not\r\n\r\nabuse   democratic  privileges.   By   trying   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  these  privileges and  preventing  them\r\n\r\nfrom  being  abused, we are actually  helping  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system run smoothly. If you say that to\r\n\r\ncut  down  the  time  of speeches  is  to  curtail\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights, then it is not correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has said just now that the former Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis took about seven and a half hours to make his speech in\r\n\r\nthis House. But I want to ask, \"Was he airing  the\r\n\r\nviews  of the people in those days?\" We know  that\r\n\r\nthe people elected him on a P.A.P. ticket. We also\r\n\r\nknow  that  he  went  against the  P.A.P. without\r\n\r\nconsulting  the  voters  in  his  electorate.  The\r\n\r\npeople  elected  him because he was  in  agreement\r\n\r\nwith the principles of the P.A.P. That was why  he\r\n\r\nwas  elected on a P.A.P. ticket. But when he  went\r\n\r\nagainst  the  P.A.P., he did not go  back  to  his\r\n\r\nelectorate.  Could  he  claim  to  represent   his\r\n\r\nelectorate? He spoke in this House for eight hours\r\n\r\nor more, but we cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that he was really representing them. He  was\r\n\r\nactually representing himself. We can even  go  to\r\n\r\nthe extent of saying that he was not even speaking\r\n\r\non  behalf of his own Party, because he  has  been\r\n\r\nthrown out by his own Party. So we can say that to\r\n\r\nspeak  at  length will bring you to the  brink  of\r\n\r\ndisaster.  Of  course, we know that Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh  was  discarded by the people  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  and he has now been thrown out  by  his\r\n\r\nown Party in the second instance. This perhaps was\r\n\r\nbecause  of his unnecessary and lengthy  speeches.\r\n\r\nWe  want to urge the Members opposite to take note\r\n\r\nof  the fate of Dr Lee and to learn a lesson from\r\n\r\nthat.  You must not try to get the words of others\r\n\r\nand  nuix them together with those of your own and\r\n\r\nclaim  that  you  are speaking on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one other point. The\r\n\r\nMember   for   Paya  Lebar  has  said   that   the\r\n\r\nrestriction on the time of speeches would  mean  a\r\n\r\nloss  to the Assembly. I do not agree with him  on\r\n\r\nthis  point.  In  my view, if the  Opposition  can\r\n\r\noffer constructive criticisms, of course, we  will\r\n\r\nwelcome  them. The more they can offer  them,  the\r\n\r\nbetter  it  will be for us. But if  they  want  to\r\n\r\nresort  to  ill-founded rumours in this  House  in\r\n\r\norder to defame the Party in power, then the  less\r\n\r\nthey  talk the better. In fact, if we can restrict\r\n\r\nthem  from going along those lines, it will ensure\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of parliamentary democracy in this\r\n\r\ncountry. We must not allow the Members opposite to\r\n\r\nwaste  the time of this House which also  means  a\r\n\r\nwaste of public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one saying, \"Your own essay is better\r\n\r\nthan  that of others.\" If you write a long  essay,\r\n\r\nyou  expect others to read it with care, otherwise\r\n\r\nthere  is no point in writing it at all. Similarly\r\n\r\nif  you  want  to speak, you must have  listeners,\r\n\r\notherwise   you  might  as  well  remain   silent.\r\n\r\nDemocracy  means that the minority must  go  along\r\n\r\nwith  the majority. It is not the other way round.\r\n\r\nIf a Member wants to show off his talent in making\r\n\r\nspeeches  at the expense of the time of other  Members,  then  it  is  not  correct  and  democratic\r\n\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the establishment of Malaysia, the\r\n\r\npolitical  centre  of our nation  has  shifted  to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur, namely the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament, so that the major problems now\r\n\r\nare  dealt  with and debated upon in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nHouse  of Representatives in Kuala Lumpur. In  the\r\n\r\nState  Legislative Assembly, we are given autonomy\r\n\r\nin labour and education. We have been able to make\r\n\r\nspectacular  progress  in housing.  But  the  main\r\n\r\nconcern of the Barisan Sosialis appears to be  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of internal security. This question  has\r\n\r\nbeen  shifted  to  the  Central  Parliament.  This\r\n\r\nAssembly  is  no longer the forum for the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to  deal with the question  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  In  view  of the  shifting  of  certain\r\n\r\nmatters  to  the Central Parliament, our  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  must be amended according to the  existing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  To  restrict the  time  of  making\r\n\r\nspeeches   is   not  to  unduly   give   ourselves\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has mentioned that in Nigeria a\r\n\r\nMember  is only allowed to speak for a maximum  of\r\n\r\n30   minutes  on  any  subject.  Nigeria   is   an\r\n\r\nindependent country, and this is what  happens  in\r\n\r\nits Parliament. In Australia, where the population\r\n\r\nis   greater  and  the  Legislature  has  a   long\r\n\r\nhistorical  experience and standing,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  limitation on the debate  on  the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement made by the Governor-General.  A  Member\r\n\r\nis  only  allowed to speak for 25 minutes  on  the\r\n\r\nAddress  of  Thanks for the policy  statement.  On\r\n\r\nother matters such as the Second Reading of Bills,\r\n\r\neven  the  mover  himself and the  Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are  restricted to a limit  of  45  minutes, and any other Member is allowed 30 minutes\r\n\r\nto  speak. As regards the debate on other  matters\r\n\r\nin  the  Australian Parliament, a mover is allowed\r\n\r\n30  minutes  and  any  other  Member  20  minutes.\r\n\r\nAustralia  is  a democratic country  with  a  long\r\n\r\nhistory,  and  yet  nobody  has  ever  said  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the limitation on the time  of  making\r\n\r\nspeeches,  Australia  is no  longer  a  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said a few moments\r\n\r\nago  that  our  amendments are  moulded  with  the\r\n\r\nintention   of   paving   the   way   towards    a\r\n\r\ndictatorship.  But we know that in his  own  Party\r\n\r\nthere  is even greater dictatorship. Their  former\r\n\r\nChairman made a complaint that he presented a long\r\n\r\nstatement  but  this  was  suppressed   by   other\r\n\r\nCommittee  members  and  not  published  in  their\r\n\r\norgan. We must thank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  lucky stars that they have not been  able  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  power, otherwise the same thing or  even\r\n\r\nworse might happen in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arguments further point out that in the\r\n\r\nCentral Government there is no limitation on time.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, of course, Members of Parliament in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur are allowed to speak throughout  the\r\n\r\nwhole  year  for  365  days, if  they  so  choose,\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is no provision  in  the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders to curb the hours of speech-making. But  in\r\n\r\npractice, I believe the Member for Jurong and  the\r\n\r\nMember  fo,r  Bukit Merah understand that  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of debating the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong's\r\n\r\nspeech only last month, two days were allotted for\r\n\r\nthe   debate,  but  there  are  200   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  and  so many of them did  not  have  a\r\n\r\nchance  to speak even for one minute. So one  must\r\n\r\nnot  make  a sweeping statement in any event.  Our\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment ensures, at  least,  that  any\r\n\r\nMember  will  be given one hour to  speak  on  any\r\n\r\ntopic.  Singapore  is  a place  where  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech  is allowed. There is no topic in Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  cannot  be dealt with adequately  within  an\r\n\r\nhour. But if you want to repeat yourself over  and\r\n\r\nover again - you may be given one hour one day or\r\n\r\neven  ten  days - you will still not finish  your\r\n\r\nspeech.  From our past experience, we  found  that\r\n\r\nwhatever the Opposition Members said was  more  or\r\n\r\nless  stereotyped. Members repeated themselves  or\r\n\r\nrepeated words that had been spoken by others. But\r\n\r\nthey  all boiled down to the same thing. They were\r\n\r\njust  like  official stereotyped documents.  There\r\n\r\nwere no differences between them. You listened  to\r\n\r\ntheir first sentence and you knew what was to come\r\n\r\nnext.  Now,  are we to be entertained or  burdened\r\n\r\nwith  such  speeches?  In fact,  if  you  want  to\r\n\r\nexpress  views  as they have done, a  few  minutes\r\n\r\nwill  be  enough. They do not require one hour  to\r\n\r\nrepeat   themselves.   We   welcome   constructive\r\n\r\ncriticism - that goes without saying but  if  they\r\n\r\nwant  to speak on behalf of the Indonesians  about\r\n\r\ntheir innocence, then restriction of time will  be\r\n\r\ngood  for the democratic system. In fact, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  great help to the maintenance of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the amendments to the Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\nthe Government Members have given many reasons  to\r\n\r\ndefend  their proposed amendments to the  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders,  especially  on the curbing  of  the  time\r\n\r\nallotted  to  Members. We know that  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nsits   very  rarely.  The  last  sitting  was   in\r\n\r\nDecember.  There are many Government policies  and\r\n\r\nmeasures   which  merit  the  criticism   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties,  but we  are  not  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to do so. If the Standing Orders limit\r\n\r\nthe speaking time of Opposition Members, then they\r\n\r\nwill  find  difficulty in having ample opportunity\r\n\r\nand  time to deal with all the various aspects  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies and measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Culture have said just now that the speeches of the Opposition Members last only ten to fifteen\r\n\r\nminutes; therefore, one bout- is enough. But  they\r\n\r\nmust  not make such a comparison. It does not mean\r\n\r\nthat in future Members will speak for only ten  to\r\n\r\nfifteen  minutes on any topic. In  future  Members\r\n\r\nwill  be restricted and limited by Standing Orders\r\n\r\nin their speeches. For example, on the question of\r\n\r\nthe  policy speech, it is impossible for us to air\r\n\r\nour   views  within  one  hour.  Therefore,   such\r\n\r\nlimitation is harmful. The fact that Members  have\r\n\r\nspoken  for ten to fifteen minutes does show  that\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members have not abused their  freedom\r\n\r\nof   speech.  We  do  not  speak  longer  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessary. We are not, as they describe, trying to\r\n\r\nmake  long-winded  speeches.  Can  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters and Members prove with facts that in the\r\n\r\npast  the Opposition Members spoke for many  hours\r\n\r\nin  order to delay and protract matters? Sometimes\r\n\r\nwe  spoke  at  great  length,  but  sometimes  our\r\n\r\nspeeches lasted for only ten to fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Ministers have been looking down\r\n\r\non  us.  They  have been saying that our  speeches\r\n\r\nhave  been written by others. They say that it  is\r\n\r\nin  insult to the spirit of democracy. But is that\r\n\r\nthe  actual fact? Let us look at the report of the\r\n\r\ndebate which took place in December. It shows that\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers' speeches were written by some\r\n\r\nothers or by the boss of the C.I.D. Their speeches\r\n\r\nmerely praised the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame for insulting parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nshould not lie with the Opposition but with\r\n\r\nGovernment Meat-hers. For example, last year there\r\n\r\nwas a time when there was no sitting at all\r\n\r\nbecause the Government was afraid that the\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties might attack them or criticise\r\n\r\ntheir wrong policies. This is a real insult to\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. When one of their Ministers died they dared not hold a by-election\r\n\r\nin Sembawang. That was a real irony of democracy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government arrested Opposition Members\r\n\r\nwithout giving reasons, that was a real affront to\r\n\r\nthe democratic principle and spirit. What we want\r\n\r\nis to have an open debate. But past experience has\r\n\r\nshown that there has been no opportunity for an\r\n\r\nopen debate in Singapore. Whenever we applied for\r\n\r\na permit to hold a mass rally or any other\r\n\r\nmeeting, our application was invariably turned\r\n\r\ndown. The Government controls the radio. We were\r\n\r\ndeprived of the opportunity to speak over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of speech outside this House has become a\r\n\r\nrelic in the museum, and they want to turn freedom\r\n\r\nof speech in this Assembly into another relic in\r\n\r\nthe museum. That is why they are introducing these\r\n\r\namendments to the Standing Orders. In spite of the\r\n\r\nfact that we, Opposition Members, look very young,\r\n\r\nthe Government want to limit the opportunity for\r\n\r\ndebate. That shows that the Government are afraid\r\n\r\nof us. They say we speak at great length. If\r\n\r\nOpposition Parties have been speaking longer than\r\n\r\nis necessary hut their speeches really expose the\r\n\r\nfaults and, shortcomings of the Government, then\r\n\r\ntheir speeches should be welcomed. Now, if the\r\n\r\ncontents of the speeches are good, of course, they\r\n\r\nare willing to listen to what we speak, and the\r\n\r\npeople on our side are willing to listen to what\r\n\r\nthey speak.

Whether or not the\r\n\r\nspeeches are long depend on the judgment of the\r\n\r\npeople outside this House. If the speeches are\r\n\r\ngood, they welcome them. Of course, the Party in\r\n\r\npower would like us to talk in such a way that\r\n\r\nthey themselves would be glad. They want us to\r\n\r\nshut up. As observers of the Government, we, of\r\n\r\ncourse, want to criticise them for any wrong deeds\r\n\r\nor mistakes, and if there is anything good done by\r\n\r\nthem, we would express our thanks. So that is why\r\n\r\nwe make speeches in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I was saying that we have been given very\r\n\r\nlittle opportunity for open argument and open debate.\r\n\r\nBut the P.A.P., on the other hand, for instance, the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, could go to Radio Singapore and have\r\n\r\n12 talks over the air, thus wasting public funds. The\r\n\r\nPress was full of it. The funny talks of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave been broadcast over Radio Singapore almost all\r\n\r\nthe time in four languages, resulting in Radio Singa\r\n\r\npore becoming the P.A.P.'s possession. People like the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture have been wont to talk about\r\n\r\nthings such as Radio Jakarta, Communist, pro-Communist. \r\n\r\nSuch speeches need not last one hour. They\r\n\r\ncould be condensed into a few minutes. Still we\r\n\r\nwelcome an open argument and we would like the Party\r\n\r\nin power to afford us, the Opposition Members, also\r\n\r\nthe same facilities as they are enjoying themselves\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On debating the amendments to the Standing Orders,\r\n\r\nthey have nothing to talk about, no good things to\r\n\r\nmention, so they mention Dr Lee Siew Choh and other\r\n\r\nirrelevant matters in the course of the debate.

Just now the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour has said that we do not have democracy in\r\n\r\nour Party and that we suppressed Dr Lee Siew\r\n\r\nChoh's statement. But it is his ignorance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof facts which makes him utter such things. I would\r\n\r\nadvise him to have a look at our Party organ so\r\n\r\nthat he could be clear about the facts - [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please allow the Member to\r\n\r\nproceed.

Of course, it is very easy for the\r\n\r\nParty in power to advance reasons whether rightly or\r\n\r\nwrongly. They could even cite South Vietnam as a good\r\n\r\nexample where there is no freedom of speech and there\r\n\r\nis no democracy. They can even advance South Vietnam\r\n\r\nas a good example to show that since there is no\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, we here also should follow\r\n\r\nsuit. I would like to ask the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwhether it has made a careful study of other examples ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Such as?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They should compare how\r\n\r\nthe Government in power and how the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\nare like in those examples quoted by them. If without\r\n\r\ncomparison they merely advance these examples as their\r\n\r\nreasons, then these reasons are not sound because they\r\n\r\ndo not hold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these amendments, the Party in power, on the\r\n\r\none hand, try to curb the time of the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers in making speeches. Just now my colleagues\r\n\r\nhave also mentioned this. Even outside this House we\r\n\r\nhave been limited in our opportunity to criticise\r\n\r\ncertain measures of the Government. They try to reduce\r\n\r\nthe number of days of notice to be given so as to cut\r\n\r\ndown our time to study important documents issued by\r\n\r\nthe Government. We have to study the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's Speech within two days instead of seven days;\r\n\r\nand this is difficult because the Speech is an\r\n\r\nimportant and comprehensive document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the State. But, on the other hand, they try to\r\n\r\nlengthen the notice required of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nask  any  questions. So we can see that  they  are\r\n\r\nresorting  to  unfair play. I hope,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministers and the Backbenches in  power\r\n\r\nwill  actually  allow  an  open  debate  and  open\r\n\r\nargument  in  this country. But  by  moving  these\r\n\r\namendments  they prove themselves to be  deceiving\r\n\r\nthe youth of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nWe have been entertained  by  the speeches  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  and \r\n\r\nthe one-man Party Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  People's Party, the Member for  Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nTheir  common point boils down to this. Time limit\r\n\r\nmeans  no  democracy. The Minister for Labour  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Culture  have  given  adequate\r\n\r\nexplanations to deal with their point.  I  do  not\r\n\r\ndesire to repeat their arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I wish to bring up\r\n\r\nin rebuttal of the speeches made by the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers. That is with regard to the by-election in\r\n\r\nSembawang.  In  the  speech of the  last  speaker,\r\n\r\nthere  was a reference to it. He said this was  an\r\n\r\nexample  of an undemocratic act of the P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nby-election  in  Sembawang was a victory  for  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  camp.  It was not a  victory  for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  and their friends. In the last  elections\r\n\r\nthey   were  unable  to  retrieve  the   seat   in\r\n\r\nSembawang.  I  support  the  amendments   to   the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders because, insofar as the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people and the Assembly are concerned, the\r\n\r\namendments are good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate on the motion to\r\n\r\namend  the Standing Orders, I was paying attention\r\n\r\nto  the time that Opposition Members took to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  points.  I found that the Member  for  Hong\r\n\r\nLirn  took eight minutes, to be exact, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Merah 10 minutes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Member  for  Paya Lebar  15 minutes, and the\r\n\r\nlong-winded speech  was that  of the Member for \r\n\r\nThomson who took about  20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that if the principle of\r\n\r\ndemocracy were on the brink of collapse  when  the\r\n\r\nOpposition would lose their democratic rights, the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  would utilise  more  time  in\r\n\r\nattacking  the  Government. But  much  beyond  our\r\n\r\nexpectations,  while the old Standing  orders  are\r\n\r\nstill in force without any new amendments being in\r\n\r\nforce,  the  Opposition took a shorter  time  than\r\n\r\nexpected  in this debate. If they had  wanted  to,\r\n\r\nthey  could  have  taken up  more  time  and  even\r\n\r\nprolonged the debate to tomorrow morning, but  the\r\n\r\nlongest  speech of the Opposition today took  only\r\n\r\n20  minutes. I was very surprised and, in fact, it\r\n\r\nis  regrettable that the Barisan Sosialis have  so\r\n\r\nlittle  to say on this grave matter as they  claim\r\n\r\nit to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson has said that\r\n\r\nthere  is no freedom of speech. I do not  want  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to the pioneer of long-windedness,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  former Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,  who\r\n\r\ntook  about 7\ufffd hours to make a speech  here  to\r\n\r\nbreak the record. Talking about freedom of speech,\r\n\r\nDr Lee Siew Choh said that whenever he wanted  to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  his own Party he was restricted.  If  a\r\n\r\nsocialist  is courageous enough to face realities,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  the  Barisan  Sosialis  restrict  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of speech of its own Chairman?  They  say\r\n\r\nthat  we do not give them enough freedom of speech\r\n\r\nwhen  they  themselves did  not  give  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech   to  their  own  Chairman.  Whatever   the\r\n\r\nChairman   had  to  say,  there  was  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ncurtailment to his speech. How can they claim that\r\n\r\nthey  are  champions  of  freedom  of  speech  and\r\n\r\nchampions of democracy when they themselves do not\r\n\r\nallow democratic rights to exist? The people could\r\n\r\nsee   for   themselves  that   in   the   National\r\n\r\nReferendum, both inside and outside this House, we\r\n\r\nwere  confronted by the Barisan Sosialis. To  what\r\n\r\never   queries  they  raised,  there  were  always\r\n\r\nadequate  replies and suitable answers given,  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  why we were able to win in the National\r\n\r\nReferendum.   We   are   not   as   arrogant    as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  claim  us to be. In fact, it was because  we\r\n\r\nwere  humble enough to expect criticism  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis that we went back to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated that every time a\r\n\r\nMember opposite speaks, I have noted the time, and\r\n\r\nthe  total time they have taken to speak does  not\r\n\r\namount  to  one hour. This is precisely  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  they have all the time in the world to speak\r\n\r\ntheir  minds  freely. They say this is  a  country\r\n\r\nwithout  freedom of speech. We say that it  is  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  that freedom of speech does not  exist,\r\n\r\nand Indonesia is the country that they look up to.\r\n\r\nIf  they  think that by resorting to anti-national\r\n\r\nactivities  they can have more freedom of  speech,\r\n\r\nthen let me tell them that this is but a fantasy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has likened the speeches of the Opposition Members to old grandmother's tales which are long-winded and unnecessary. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  has  good reasons  for  drawing  this\r\n\r\nanalogy.  In fact, whatever they have  said  could\r\n\r\nhave been said in less words than necessary. I can\r\n\r\nwell  take  a  whole day to express the  points  I\r\n\r\nhave.  I  can talk about my morning ablutions,  my\r\n\r\nbusiness that I have to do every day, and go on to\r\n\r\nother  trivial matters, thus wasting a lot of  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  this House. The champion who  broke  the\r\n\r\nrecord took 7\ufffd hours in this House. They  could\r\n\r\nsee for themselves that whatever they have said at\r\n\r\nlength  were actually speeches written  by  people\r\n\r\noutside  this  House. In fact, one could  see  for\r\n\r\noneself that speeches were handed to Dr Lee  from\r\n\r\ntime to time by other members of his Party. He had\r\n\r\nnothing better to talk than to go back to what had\r\n\r\nbeen  said. He resorted to the tactic of \"fatigue\"\r\n\r\nin  order  to deceive the people to give them  the\r\n\r\nimpression that he was speaking on their behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to take up too much\r\n\r\ntime.  The point really is that Singapore  is  now\r\n\r\nfaced   with   a  grave  problem.  The   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment has to reconstruct Singapore.  We  want\r\n\r\nto  turn  Singapore into a prosperous  and  strong\r\n\r\ncountry.  If  we  can  do well  in  Singapore,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  same prosperity will be extended  to\r\n\r\nMalaya.

So\r\n\r\nbasically  they do not even know the procedure  of\r\n\r\nthis  House. When Question Time comes along,  they\r\n\r\ntalk   rubbish.  At  the  last  sitting  of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  I think the Member for Jalan  Kayu  was\r\n\r\ngetting impatient when his Party Chairman  took  7\ufffd  hours  of this House. As a result, they  lost\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections in spite  of  the  lengthy\r\n\r\nspeeches  they made here. The idea is not  in  the\r\n\r\nquantity hut the quality of the speeches.  Quality\r\n\r\nis  more  important than quantity.  Lenin  himself\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  is the quality of the  Party  that\r\n\r\nmatters and not the quantity.

Whether the system is to succeed or fail\r\n\r\ndepends  on how you take it. The type of democracy\r\n\r\nthat   the  Barisan  Sosialis  advocate   can   be\r\n\r\nunderstood  in  this example.

We\r\n\r\nwelcome  the Member for Thomson who said that  any\r\n\r\ngood  thing  done  by  the  Government  should  be\r\n\r\nsupported  by the people.

I want to make  a\r\n\r\nbrief  reply to them. Ever since 1961, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have been holding many mass rallies  and\r\n\r\nthey have given out statements. We have given them\r\n\r\nall  the  facilities to do so, apart  from  making\r\n\r\nlong  speeches in this House. Yet they say success\r\n\r\nor  failure does not depend on whether  they  make\r\n\r\nlong  speeches in the House, but on  whether  they\r\n\r\nmake   well-intentioned  criticism  or  evil   and\r\n\r\ndestructive criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  listening  to  the\r\n\r\nspeeches of the Members opposite touching  on  the\r\n\r\namendments to the Standing Orders. They have  been\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  amendments are dictatorial  and\r\n\r\nundemocratic. We have been listening to  the  same\r\n\r\nspeeches ever since 1961. All this belongs to  the\r\n\r\nsame  trite speeches. Yet they have been repeating\r\n\r\nthem. It is a waste of the time of this House.  In\r\n\r\nmy view, the amendments to the Standing Orders are\r\n\r\nmade  in  order  to  guide the Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nalong a better road so as to enable them to make a\r\n\r\nbetter   contribution  to   the   maintenance   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy, and  not  to  abuse  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights and freedom of speech  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. They should make good use of their time  by\r\n\r\nstudying  the various subjects and topics  and  to\r\n\r\noffer constructive views and suggestions, and  not\r\n\r\nto copy speeches written by others and recite them\r\n\r\nin   this  House.  Another  spirit  of  these  new\r\n\r\nStanding Orders is to allow every Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse time to speak here and not to allow only one\r\n\r\nMember  to speak, thus depriving other Members  of\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the new Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I did not originally intend to speak on these amendments to the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders because several of my  colleagues\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  their  views  on  this  matter.

But has Singapore become\r\n\r\nthe New York of Malaysia? One of the functions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislature,  especially under  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  of government, is to enable the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties to criticise and to supervise the work  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  If  you deprive  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  of  the  time to speak in  the  House  by\r\n\r\nlimiting it to one hour, it is impossible for them\r\n\r\nto  express all their views. This is especially so\r\n\r\nif  the issue discussed in this House involves the\r\n\r\nproblems  and livelihood of the people. We  should\r\n\r\nbe  given all the facilities and time to supervise\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  the Government. They  should  adopt\r\n\r\ncertain  of  our suggestions and criticisms  which\r\n\r\nare  conducive to the welfare of the people.  This\r\n\r\nwould   provide  them  with  the  opportunity   to\r\n\r\nconsider  our  views  on certain  issues.  In  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the policy speech, there was no limit on\r\n\r\nthe  time. But now they want to limit our time  in\r\n\r\ndebating  the  policy speech  because  the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech  embodies  all  the  Government  plans  and\r\n\r\npolicies in the coming year and all the things the\r\n\r\nGovernment  want to do. They concern the  problems\r\n\r\nof  the people. If the Opposition Parties are  not\r\n\r\ngiven  ample time to study and discuss the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech,  this will mean that the people will  have\r\n\r\nvery  few  chances  to  air their  views  on  such\r\n\r\nimportant  matters.  For  example,  from  my   own\r\n\r\nexperience,  whatever the Government want  to  do,\r\n\r\nthey  consult  among  themselves.  The  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties, on the other hand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare not given such an opportunity to consult among\r\n\r\nthemselves. We are not in a position to know  many\r\n\r\nof  the things which the Government intend to  do.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  when we are given all the facilities\r\n\r\nand  the time to speak that we can fulfil our role\r\n\r\nas  Opposition  Members. You cannot  allocate  the\r\n\r\ntime  in  proportion to the number of  Members  on\r\n\r\neach  side.  If  that is done, we,  being  in  the\r\n\r\nminority Party, will be deprived of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to notices, whenever we want to ask\r\n\r\nquestions we must give longer notice. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, whatever the Government want to do, they can\r\n\r\ndo  so by giving shorter notice, because all these\r\n\r\nare provided for in the amended Standing Orders. I\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten  which particular  Standing  Order\r\n\r\nprovides for that. Previously we were given  ample\r\n\r\ntinie  to  study all the documents and Bills.  But\r\n\r\nnow  that is not the case. Whenever we want to ask\r\n\r\nquestions, we have to give four days' notice. But,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, when the Government  want  to\r\n\r\nraise  any important measures in this House,  they\r\n\r\nneed  give  only short notice. They thus  give  us\r\n\r\nvery  little time to study the issue. We  are  not\r\n\r\ngiven  the facilities and the time to look up  the\r\n\r\nnecessary material and data. Whatever we speak  in\r\n\r\nthis House is not meant for you but for the people\r\n\r\noutside  this  House. Our duty is to  the  people.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also the duty of this House. I hope  the\r\n\r\nParty in power will not criticise the fact that we\r\n\r\nhave been too lengthy in our speeches. They should\r\n\r\nnot  themselves drag irrelevant matters into  this\r\n\r\nHouse. The Party in power can consult our Party on\r\n\r\nany  matters to be discussed in this House. We can\r\n\r\nhave  certain  arrangements  before  matters   are\r\n\r\nbrought  into  this House. If they can  have  this\r\n\r\nmutual  consultation in a parliamentary democracy,\r\n\r\nthen  there would not be any waste of time of this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Speaking  generally, I  would  advise  the\r\n\r\nParty in power not to use dictatorial measures  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. This House should be responsible  for\r\n\r\nall the issues affecting the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now a Government Member has said that his\r\n\r\nParty  was  victorious in Sembawang.

I do not think I should allow Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition to get away with any allegation that we\r\n\r\nare stopping them from speaking in this House. On\r\n\r\nthe contrary, this afternoon, we had three Bills\r\n\r\nput up for debate in this Chamber but none of the\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition spoke a word about them -\r\n\r\nand they were very important enactments\r\n\r\nindeed. Furthermore, none of the Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers can complain that they had no time to\r\n\r\nscrutinise them. Copies of the Bills had been\r\n\r\ncirculated to them for some time now in order to\r\n\r\nenable them to study them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if it is any consolation to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, or, for that matter, any Member of the\r\n\r\nOpposition, may I remind them that Abraham\r\n\r\nLincoln's Gettysburg Address covered less than 500\r\n\r\nwords, and it took less than ten minutes to\r\n\r\ndeliver? Today it has become an immortal speech\r\n\r\nwhich has been cited again and again, simply be\r\n\r\ncause of the simplicity and the message contained\r\n\r\nin those 500 words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis made two\r\n\r\nseven-hour speeches in this Assembly, and although\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnewspapers may very well have carried what he had\r\n\r\nsaid  in  this Assembly, his speeches  have  gone\r\n\r\ninto  oblivion. Nobody remembers the  message  he\r\n\r\nwas trying to drive home. Let that be a moral  to\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of the Opposition,  that  the  main\r\n\r\npurpose  of  a  speech is to drive home  a  point\r\n\r\nwhich  can very well be done within the space  of\r\n\r\none  hour  - that is, if there is any content  at\r\n\r\nall in the speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me deal a little with the charges made\r\n\r\nby  the  Members for Bukit Merah, Paya Lebar  and\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  on the procedure for debate  on  the\r\n\r\nNegara's Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that previously seven days' notice\r\n\r\nwas  required, after the Negara had delivered the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy speech,  to  hold  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting of the Assembly so that a debate  can  be\r\n\r\nheld  in  this  Chamber.  The  revision  in   the\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  provides for  two  clear  days'\r\n\r\nnotice.  May I ask the Opposition does it  really\r\n\r\ntake  them  seven days to study  a  speech  which\r\n\r\ntakes  only  one hour or less to deliver?  A  man\r\n\r\nmust  be very dull indeed if he requires as  many\r\n\r\nas  seven  days to study a one-hour  speech.  For\r\n\r\nthat  matter,  in  the  Dewan  Ra'ayat  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,   the  King  delivered  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy speech and on the very next day Parliament\r\n\r\nsat to debate it. The Member for Bukit Merah, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong and the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nwere  there.  They understood what the  procedure\r\n\r\nwas  and  they  did  not  have  the  audacity  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  the ruling which they had to  observe.\r\n\r\nDown here, they say that we are undemocratic  and\r\n\r\ndictatorial.  Yet we gave them every  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  raise  this point this afternoon. Can  we  be\r\n\r\nreally  dictatorial and undemocratic if we  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  accuse us of being dictatorial  and  un\r\n\r\ndemocratic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that matter, may I also remind the House\r\n\r\nthat  the arrangements for the debate on the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates were arrived at last December.  It  was\r\n\r\nagreed  after  a  resolution  was  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance that the debate on the  Main\r\n\r\nEstimates  be limited to three days.  The  reason\r\n\r\ngiven was that a large part of the Estimates  had\r\n\r\nbeen moved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  to  the  control of the Central Government.\r\n\r\nThere   were   many  departments  whose   budgets\r\n\r\npreviously   were  the  responsibility   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government, but  since  Malaysia  Day,\r\n\r\nmany  of  these departments, like Civil Aviation,\r\n\r\nPost  Office, Police and so on have  become Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\ndepartments; because they are no longer our  responsibility,\r\n\r\nthe budgets  for  these  departments   are   no  longer \r\n\r\nincluded in the Estimates. Therefore, whereas previously \r\n\r\nit  was necessary  to have five days to debate  the  Main\r\n\r\nEstimates,  it  is  now no  longer  necessary  to\r\n\r\nrequire that same length of time for a very  much\r\n\r\nreduced   Budget.   We  have  found   from   past\r\n\r\nexperience - as was the case last December -\r\n\r\nthat   three  days  was  quite  adequate.  Nobody\r\n\r\ngrumbled  about  it. None of the Barisan  Members\r\n\r\ncomplained.  But today they made a lot  of  noise\r\n\r\nsimply  because they had to make  some  noise.  I\r\n\r\nhave totted up for their benefit that all in  all\r\n\r\nthere will be five days to discuss the Budget\r\n\r\n-   one  day's  debate  devoted  to  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  Budget Statement, three days  on  the\r\n\r\nMain  Estimates  and one day on  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.  And  for  the  benefit  of  the   new\r\n\r\nAssembly Members of the Barisan Sosialis, let  me\r\n\r\ninform  them that in the past five years  it  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  the  practice  of  the  Speaker  to\r\n\r\nallocate   only  one  day  for  debate   on   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates. Therefore, it  is  absurd\r\n\r\nindeed  for anyone of them to complain  that  one\r\n\r\nday is inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end with this note. It is true that\r\n\r\nthere has been no sitting of the Assembly for the\r\n\r\nlast  six months, hut may I remind the House that\r\n\r\nthe  last sittings we had in December lasted  one\r\n\r\nmonth?  It  took us one month to get through  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Negara's Speech and the Budget.  We\r\n\r\ncompleted all Government business; no Bills  were\r\n\r\nleft  in abeyance. We shall call sittings of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  from  time to time when the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  business to transact or when it  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the State that the Government  should\r\n\r\ndeliver  a  policy  statement  for  debate.   But\r\n\r\nbelieve me, we are not going to call a sitting of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  at  the pleasure  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis just to hear the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntripe  they  dish out and which we have  had  to\r\n\r\nendure in the past. However, they need not  fear\r\n\r\nthat  democratic  rights will be  abolished.  We\r\n\r\nhave  neither the intention to abolish elections\r\n\r\nnor  the intention to abolish the Assembly.  All\r\n\r\nthat   is   impossible.  The   Singapore   State\r\n\r\nConstitution   is   part   of   the    Malaysian\r\n\r\nConstitution. If there are any changes at all in\r\n\r\nthe  way  Malaysia  is  going  to  be  run,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the way the States are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nrun,  the  power lies not in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government but in the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the amendments\r\n\r\nset  out  in  Appendix I to the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders Committee as contained in  Paper\r\n\r\nL.A.  1  of 1964 be and are hereby made  to  the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn to\r\n\r\na date to be fixed.\" - [Dr Toh Chin Chye]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">thirteen minutes past Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
