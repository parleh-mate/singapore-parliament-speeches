Eighty-three resigned in 1974 and  15  in\r\n\r\nthe first two months of 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any further resignations in the\r\n\r\noffing. In the last two years most resignations of\r\n\r\ndoctors  took place at the beginning of the  year,\r\n\r\nthat is, after they have received their 13th month\r\n\r\npayment in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 98 doctors who resigned, 69 were without\r\n\r\nhigher   qualifications,   26   possessed   higher\r\n\r\nqualifications and two were consultants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 83 doctors who resigned in 1974, 57 or\r\n\r\n73%  were young doctors with less than four years'\r\n\r\nservice. Eight were experienced doctors with  more\r\n\r\nthan ten years' service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in 1974 and the first two months of 1975,\r\n\r\n129    doctors    including   17    with    higher\r\n\r\nqualifications  joined  the  service.  There  was,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a net gain of 31 doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors of consultant rank in service in 1974 were\r\n\r\n80,  compared to 65 in 1973, and 48 in 1970. There\r\n\r\nwere 91 Senior Registrars in 1974, compared to  40\r\n\r\nin  1970.  There  were  60 medical  officers  with\r\n\r\nhigher qualifications in 1974, compared to  36  in\r\n\r\n1970. The quality of the medical services has  not\r\n\r\nsuffered.   In   fact,  there   have   been   more\r\n\r\nconsultants,    and    doctors     with     higher\r\n\r\nqualifications   in  service   and   with   better\r\n\r\nfacilities and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now about 100 vacancies in the\r\n\r\nestablishment for doctors. However,  at  any  time\r\n\r\nabout  40 National Service doctors are working  in\r\n\r\nthe hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is to recruit more young doctors to\r\n\r\nlessen  the workload on the existing staff because\r\n\r\nof  the vacancies, as well as to man our expanding\r\n\r\nmedical  services. There is also  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nretaining  them  in the service and  reducing  the\r\n\r\nturnover  of  doctors. A number of positive  steps\r\n\r\nhave been taken to meet the problem. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> 1. Accelerated Promotion Opportunities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions have now been made on merit. They are\r\n\r\nno  longer  limited to the number of higher  posts\r\n\r\navailable    in   the   establishment.   Promotion\r\n\r\nexercises have been held twice a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. More Training Awards And Fellowships.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a Medical Traineeship Scheme young doctors\r\n\r\nwho want to become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecialists can apply and be selected  as  trainee\r\n\r\ndesignates. They are given guidance and facilities\r\n\r\nto  acquire higher qualifications from our  School\r\n\r\nof  Postgraduate Studies. At present there are  62\r\n\r\ntrainee  designates under the Scheme. A  selection\r\n\r\nexercise is now being conducted for another  batch\r\n\r\nof  more than 50 candidates. Awards and fellowship\r\n\r\nfor  courses  of  study as well as  for  practical\r\n\r\ntraining  abroad  have been  given  liberally.  At\r\n\r\npresent  there are 14 Government doctors  studying\r\n\r\nabroad  for specialist qualifications. Another  18\r\n\r\nhave been selected to go abroad on scholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3. Revision of Specialist Allowance.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist allowance payable to doctors with\r\n\r\nhigher  qualifications  has  been  improved  since\r\n\r\n1969. The allowance ranges from $100 to $1,000 per\r\n\r\nmonth according to the grade of the officer.  This\r\n\r\nspecialist  allowance  is  not  payable  to  other\r\n\r\nprofessional officers in the Civil Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors without higher qualifications also have\r\n\r\nhad  increases  in remuneration  by  revisions  of\r\n\r\nsalary,  National Wages Council  Awards  and  13th\r\n\r\nmonth  payments.  For example, a  medical  officer\r\n\r\nafter  the second year of service will now receive\r\n\r\nan  all-in salary of $1,588.50 per month, compared\r\n\r\nto $1,200 in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is very much aware of the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  young  Government  doctors  have  in\r\n\r\nfinding  suitable accommodation. My  Ministry  has\r\n\r\ntherefore planned to build three 28-storey  blocks\r\n\r\ncomprising  a  total  of 264  five-room  apartment\r\n\r\nunits  as  quarters for Government doctors.  These\r\n\r\nthree  blocks  will be part of the development  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore General Hospital at Outram Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, my Ministry is negotiating an offer by\r\n\r\nthe Port of Singapore Authority to let out or sell\r\n\r\nto   our   doctors  apartments  being   built   at\r\n\r\nSpottiswoode Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferential condition for housing is a better way\r\n\r\nof attracting and retaining doctors in the service\r\n\r\nthan an outright increase in salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the doctors tendered their\r\n\r\nresignations,  did the Personnel  officer  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health try to persuade them  to  stay\r\n\r\nand  so  retain these doctors? Or did the  officer\r\n\r\njust  say, \"If you want to resign, you can resign.\r\n\r\nThere are others, who want to join the service.\" I\r\n\r\nwould like to know if there were such instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, we do not take such an\r\n\r\nattitude.  The point is that we try  our  best  to\r\n\r\nretain our doctors. Once the doctors have made  up\r\n\r\ntheir  mind to resign, they will of course  resign\r\n\r\nbecause  they  must have made other  arrangements.\r\n\r\nBut  we  do  try to find out what are the  reasons\r\n\r\nbehind  their  resignations and see  if  there  is\r\n\r\nanything  possible we can do to prevent them  from\r\n\r\nresigning. We have tried. But, as I have  said  in\r\n\r\nmy  reply, one of the reasons which induce  young\r\n\r\ndoctors  to resign is their difficulty in  finding\r\n\r\nsuitable  accommodation because of higher rentals.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason why my Ministry has planned  to\r\n\r\nbuild   three   28-storey  blocks   of   five-room\r\n\r\napartments as quarters for Government doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah should not be under the\r\n\r\nimpression  that the Ministry's attitude  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  should resign if they want to. The point  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  they insist on resigning, there is  very\r\n\r\nlittle we can do about it. But everything has been\r\n\r\ndone to encourage them to remain in service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF SINGAPORE FOR THE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1975 TO 31ST MARCH, 1976</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of Supply [2nd Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>2.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Communications has the very\r\n\r\nonerous  task of reorganising our public transport\r\n\r\nsystem. The Ministry also has to solve the growing\r\n\r\ncongestion  on our roads as well as to  streamline\r\n\r\nour  traffic  system in line with  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  developments for the  benefit  of  our\r\n\r\npeople. This is a very important task and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation of the public transport system\r\n\r\nwill be successful.\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to raise three questions. First,\r\n\r\nit  is  about  the reorganisation  of  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system,  which  has  already  been   in\r\n\r\noperation for two or three years. There  has  been\r\n\r\nsome  progress made but, according to the  public,\r\n\r\nprogress  has  been very slow. The  reorganisation\r\n\r\nincludes the introduction of bus lanes, pedestrian\r\n\r\nwalks and the restriction of traffic flow into the\r\n\r\nCBD.  The purpose of these measures is, of course,\r\n\r\nto  improve travel by public transport. Since  the\r\n\r\nreorganisatiop. I would like to know whether there\r\n\r\nhas been any marked or radical improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what I hear, improvement has been\r\n\r\nvery slight because at peak hours traffic is still\r\n\r\nvery  congested. Moreover, we can see buses  break\r\n\r\ndown along the road. The buses also emit obnoxious\r\n\r\nsmoke and the condition inside the bus leaves much\r\n\r\nroom  for improvement. In regard to bus lanes  and\r\n\r\nthe   siting   of   bus  stops  there   are   many\r\n\r\nshortcomings which need to be remedied. And  where\r\n\r\nthe  road  is too narrow, say, Robinson  Road,  at\r\n\r\nabout  5.00  p.m, everyday the buses  are  parked\r\n\r\nalong  the bus lane by the tens. In the  end,  the\r\n\r\nbus lane is turned into a bus terminal where buses\r\n\r\nare  parked.  So you find that all the  buses  are\r\n\r\nsqueezed together in a queue, one after the other,\r\n\r\nthus  causing congestion of all the other vehicles\r\n\r\non the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Sembawang giving way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, I am rising on a point of order, and not on a\r\n\r\npoint of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. I am not giving way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I must congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  this year, for  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  improvement  in  our  mass   transport\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Certain\r\n\r\nbus  services  are  very  irregular,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  serving in the rural areas. As an  example,\r\n\r\nservice  190  from  Shenton  Way  to  Bukit  Merah\r\n\r\nparticularly  seems to be completely  absent  from 6.30  p.m, to 7.30 p.m. What I understand is  that\r\n\r\nbus drivers and conductors running this service go\r\n\r\nout  for  their meal breaks during this  hour  and\r\n\r\nthus keep the poor commuters waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I understand that some bus drivers\r\n\r\nuse  to  speed  along  the road  and  reach  their\r\n\r\nterminus  much' earlier than the scheduled  times,\r\n\r\nand  no  one questions them for arriving early.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the SBS is seriously  checking  on\r\n\r\nthe scheduled stops at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bus stops along the route to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nservice is being run frequently and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance of buses seems to be rather poor.\r\n\r\nEven  if  the engine is m a working condition,  is\r\n\r\nthe  bus  checked  to  ensure that  other  service\r\n\r\nfacilities are functioning effectively? There have\r\n\r\nbeen instances when windows as well as ventilators\r\n\r\ncannot  be closed during a shower. In these  cases\r\n\r\nit  rains  not  only outside but also  inside  the\r\n\r\nbuses. On this matter, may I ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nis  the  Registry of Vehicles doing about checking\r\n\r\nthe condition of the buses, and how frequently  is\r\n\r\na bus checked for serviceability? Is a certificate\r\n\r\nof fitness issued by the ROV for each bus? In this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I must say that the Scheme B  buses  are\r\n\r\nfar  better in cleanliness, comfort, courtesy  and\r\n\r\nservice to the commuters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also observe that at the SBS maintenance\r\n\r\ncentres,  the  spare parts are left all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace.  This encourages theft as spare  parts  are\r\n\r\nvaluable  to  some people. Can something  be  done\r\n\r\nabout  this mess? They must understand  that  they\r\n\r\npay  a very high price for these parts and without\r\n\r\nany  proper  enclosures or security measures  they\r\n\r\nare bound to be stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudeness on the part of conductors and drivers\r\n\r\nhas  been  reduced remarkably. A good job  done  I\r\n\r\nmust  say.  However,  bus drivers  still  have  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  standard of driving.  Speeding  is\r\n\r\nstill a common offence among the drivers. There is\r\n\r\na lot of publicity when new buses are commissioned\r\n\r\non the roads every month. But hardly any publicity\r\n\r\nis  given to the number of buses that are laid off\r\n\r\nthrough  breakdowns and the many  major  accidents\r\n\r\ncaused  by  some  of the reckless SBS  drivers.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister will notice this when he drives\r\n\r\nto  his office to see whether this is true. If the\r\n\r\nsame  number or more buses are taken off the  road\r\n\r\nfor these reasons, then additions of new buses  to\r\n\r\nthe  services are completely nullified. I feel  we\r\n\r\nhave  to import ready-made buses from overseas  by\r\n\r\nthe hundreds, and we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  grant  a loan to SBS for this on a  long  term\r\n\r\nbasis  to enable them to recover the cost of these\r\n\r\nbuses. In this way probably our transport problems\r\n\r\nwill be solved. Many people are willing to give up\r\n\r\ntheir  cars  only  if  the  bus  service  is  more\r\n\r\nefficient and if there are sufficient bus shelters\r\n\r\nto protect them from the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The display board on the bus showing the service\r\n\r\nnumber  and  the route needs some improvement.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect too the Scheme B service  buses  are\r\n\r\nfar  ahead of the SBS. It is pointless to  display\r\n\r\nonly  the  service  number  and  its  destination,\r\n\r\nbecause  commuters would also  like  to  know  the\r\n\r\nvarious  roads  along the service  route.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthis is not asking too much. A small display board\r\n\r\nshowing  the main roads along the route can  go  a\r\n\r\nlong way to help the travelling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being done about keeping the termini of\r\n\r\nthe  buses  clean and safe? Many of the  terminals\r\n\r\nare  covered with traces of dirty black oil spills\r\n\r\nwhich   arc  quite  often  a  source  of   danger.\r\n\r\nparticularly on rainy days. The terminals  at  Yio\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  Road  for service 73 and Upper  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad for service 165 are some examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new buses are supposed to have a new type of\r\n\r\nseat    made    of   fibre-glass.    I    presume.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this type does not last very  long.\r\n\r\nMost  of  these  seats in the buses  are  in  poor\r\n\r\ncondition. If one is not careful, one is going  to\r\n\r\nreceive  nasty  cuts  from  a  damaged  seat.  Can\r\n\r\nsomething be done to replace these seats with more\r\n\r\ndurable  material? The SBS should  not  only  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  question of quantity but  also  on  the\r\n\r\nquality of buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some terminals there is no indication which\r\n\r\nparticular  bus  is going to move out  first.  The\r\n\r\nconductors, drivers and time-keepers are  no  help\r\n\r\neither.  Surely the parking of buses at  terminals\r\n\r\ncould  be arranged in such a way that the  bus  at\r\n\r\none  end  will always leave first. This  will  not\r\n\r\nkeep  the  commuters guessing. There arc occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  commuters  board  a stationary  bus  at  the\r\n\r\nterminal but they are not told that that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbus  is either spoilt or will not be the first  to\r\n\r\nleave.  Though  so  many drivers,  conductors  and\r\n\r\ntimekeepers  are present, they just  look  at  the\r\n\r\ncommuters.  This  goes on very frequently  at  the\r\n\r\nterminal   point   near  the   Singapore   General\r\n\r\nHospital. Can something be done about it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask if the Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider extending the bus service, which now\r\n\r\nends  at Shenton Way, to serve Keppel Road  ending\r\n\r\nafter the Telok Blangah housing estate. This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the many port workers who have to take  this\r\n\r\nroute.  Furthermore a bus service should  also  be\r\n\r\nproposed from Cantonment Road to Keppel Road/Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah Road for port workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at peak hours from 4.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. the buses coming from the terminal at\r\n\r\nShenton  Way are always full. But along  the  way,\r\n\r\nfrom  Robinson  Road  to the  junction  of  Market\r\n\r\nStreet  all  the  bus stops are crowded,  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  have to wait for hours. There  must  be  a\r\n\r\ncertain  system  of  re-routing  the  buses,  say,\r\n\r\ncertain buses should be routed from the terminals,\r\n\r\ncertain  buses  from Market Street, certain  buses\r\n\r\nfrom the esplanade, and so on. But I am not saying\r\n\r\nanything  more. The Hon. Minister must  understand\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  In  the  days  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company, when their superintendents  knew\r\n\r\nthat  the  commuters were waiting in crowds,  they\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"All right, get one bus down from somewhere\r\n\r\nand  bring it here.\" Or on inspection, they  would\r\n\r\nsay.  \"Bring this service here and tell  everybody\r\n\r\nthat this bus is going to Katong,\" or \"This bus is\r\n\r\ngoing  to Serangoon.\" Why cannot the SBS use  that\r\n\r\nsystem? \"I am giving more buses\" - what is the use\r\n\r\nof  giving  more buses? The buses at the terminals\r\n\r\nare  already  full and commuters along  the  route\r\n\r\nhave to wait for hours. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will notice this if he passes along\r\n\r\nthese  roads up to High Street at 5 o'clock. There\r\n\r\nare more new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuses but they are still insufficient because they\r\n\r\nare  always full during peak hours. Therefore, SBS\r\n\r\nhas  to  arrange a way so that the passengers  can\r\n\r\nget  the  bus  at the proper time  to  reach  home\r\n\r\nearly. But now they leave office at 5 o'clock  and\r\n\r\nreach home at 7 o'clock. They work eight hours but\r\n\r\nthey  are out for 12 hours. Something must be done\r\n\r\nand the very minor matters must be considered,  or\r\n\r\nthey will become a bad problem. I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  go round these routes at 5 o'clock one day and\r\n\r\nsee what is happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b>Sir, it has always been recognised that there is a\r\n\r\nshortage  of land for development in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that there is even a special committee  to\r\n\r\nensure  that any available vacant land is properly\r\n\r\nutilised, that is, with maximum economic  benefit.\r\n\r\nThe Central Business District scheme has taken  up\r\n\r\nvaluable  land  which can be  utilised  for  other\r\n\r\nessential  projects  like recreational  parks  and\r\n\r\npublic housing. Notwithstanding the costs involved\r\n\r\nin  the construction of the numerous fringe  area-car parks, the valuable land so acquired is in use\r\n\r\nonly  for part of the day. During the night  these\r\n\r\ncar parks will be left vacant. Millions of dollars\r\n\r\nwill  be spent in the construction of these fringe\r\n\r\narea  car parks, the overhead signboards  and  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  checkpoints. The  only  consolation  in\r\n\r\nthis  scheme  is  that job opportunities  will  be\r\n\r\ncreated.  Perhaps  the Ministry of  Communications\r\n\r\nhopes to recover all or part of the cost from  the\r\n\r\nfees  collected  arising out of  this  scheme  for\r\n\r\nmotorists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regretted that the CBD scheme is to be\r\n\r\nintroduced  at  a  time when the public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem   has   not   yet  shown  any   significant\r\n\r\nimprovement. Commuters have still to wait for long\r\n\r\nhours for the buses. I concede that there is  some\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the  conduct  of  bus  crews.  My\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the men who are responsible for\r\n\r\r\nraising  the morale of the bus workers and putting\r\n\r\nsome semblance of efficient management in the SBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion the CBD scheme when\r\n\r\nimplemented  will  have  more  disadvantages  than\r\n\r\nadvantages.   For   example,   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\ncommunications  was  mainly  instrumental  in  the\r\n\r\nsuccessful  elimination of pirate taxis  from  our\r\n\r\nroads.  With the CBD scheme, there is  nothing  to\r\n\r\nprevent an enterprising person to purchase a  car,\r\n\r\nwhich is now at rock-bottom prices, round up  four\r\n\r\nor  five  persons at great personal  risk  to  the\r\n\r\npassengers  and  enter  the  CBD,  thus  making  a\r\n\r\nprofit; all with the blessings of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications. What is to prevent employers  from\r\n\r\nreimbursing  their executive and managerial  staff\r\n\r\nfor  the  area licence fees imposed? Professionals\r\n\r\nsimilarly will have no problem in paying the  fees\r\n\r\nas  they can pass this burden on to their clients.\r\n\r\nSalesmen and bill collectors will make the  claims\r\n\r\nto  their respective units for reimbursement. With\r\n\r\nincreased costs, the employers will certainly  add\r\n\r\nthis on to the cost of goods and services. In  the\r\n\r\nend,   the  poor  consumers  suffer  through  such\r\n\r\nfurther inflation; also -with the blessings of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is no restriction on the number of\r\n\r\nvehicles  that is allowed to enter  the  CBD,  and\r\n\r\ncoupled with the aforementioned loopholes, how can\r\n\r\nwe   hope  to  relieve  traffic  congestion?   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  is it worthwhile to spend  so  much\r\n\r\nmoney  on the CBD scheme only to derive so  little\r\n\r\nbenefit   from   it?  Surely   there   are   other\r\n\r\nalternative measures, like prohibiting  cars  with\r\n\r\ncertain  licence  numbers from entering  the  CBD\r\n\r\narea  at  specified times of the day. For example,\r\n\r\ncars  with licence numbers ending with 1 and  2\r\n\r\nmay be prohibited from entering the CBD on Mondays\r\n\r\nbetween  certain hours, and so on. In this  way,\r\n\r\nevery- motorist has to refrain entry into the  CBD\r\n\r\nfor  a  few  hours a week, and there  will  be  a'\r\n\r\ndefinite reduction in vehicular traffic within the\r\n\r\nCBD. I do not think that, the alternative measures\r\n\r\nproposed will in any way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolve  extensive enforcement or the  engagement\r\n\r\nof  an  army  of  inspectors to  check  on  erring\r\n\r\nmotorists.  Stiff  penalties  together  with   the\r\n\r\npoints   demerit  system  will  be  a   sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-litter campaign succeeded not because\r\n\r\nthere  was  an army of health inspectors  swarming\r\n\r\nall   over   the  place  hut  because  of   strict\r\n\r\nenforcement and stiff penalties. The present  plan\r\n\r\ntends  to favour those who can afford or who  have\r\n\r\nthe  means to recover the cost of the licence fees\r\n\r\nand increased car park charges.' I do not think it\r\n\r\nwill  relieve traffic congestion within  the  CBD.\r\n\r\nAssuming  that the proposed plan will succeed,  it\r\n\r\nwill  inevitably  transfer traffic  congestion  to\r\n\r\nother parts of the city during peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson in his\r\n\r\neloquent speech virtually tore SBS into pieces.

But  the  Government team of officials  which\r\n\r\nmoved   into  SBS  on, the  invitation   of   the\r\n\r\nmanagement only about seven months ago has managed\r\n\r\nto  do  quite  a little bit.

Perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould  stop right now so that other Members  will\r\n\r\nhave a chance to raise other\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the criticisms or queries\r\n\r\nraised `by the `Members \"for Sembawang and Anson\r\n\r\non the Singapore Bus Service are items which can\r\n\r\nreally be fully answered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  we come to amendment (2)* which will  be moved  by  the Member for Boon Teck and amendment (6)+ on the Registry of Vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\nThe amendments read as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(2) That the sum -to be allocated for, Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1901.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+(6)That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1107.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Sembawang raised two other\r\n\r\npoints  which  I think I can answer now. He mentioned  about the progress of the Mass  Transit Study.  Here again, it comes under amendment  (9)* (* The amendment reads as follows:(9) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA\r\n\r\n8101.) and  if he wilt be patient enough to wait, we  can give him the answer then. But he did mention about the  Road  Transport  Action Committee's  policies which  are not well received and inquired  whether this came within the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  of Singapore.  I  would like to bring to  his  notice that  this White Paper was a three-year  plan  for\r\n\r\nthe  period 1970-73. So it has nothing to do  with\r\n\r\nthe   Road  Transport  Action  Committee  of  five\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries,  which  was  appointed  in\r\n\r\nOctober  1973  after  the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  have  already  been  more  or   less\r\n\r\naccomplished, nor has it anything to do with the\r\n\r\nfollow-up  of  the recommendations  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  These are new policies subsequent  to  the\r\n\r\npublication of the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ with the Member that the\r\n\r\npolicies are not well received. If at all they are\r\n\r\nnot  popular  measures,  that  I  agree.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has to be responsible. It has  got  to\r\n\r\nmake  unpopular decisions and hard  decisions  in,\r\n\r\norder to resolve difficult problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, reply more fully to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Toa Payoh's reservations over the success  of\r\n\r\nthe schemes which we intend to implement to reduce\r\n\r\ntraffic   congestion  in  the   Central   Business\r\n\r\nDistrict.  So far,  about $7 million  has  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  to implement the two traffic management\r\n\r\nschemes,  namely, the park-and-ride and the  area\r\n\r\nlicensing schemes. This amount is for the con-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruction of 12 fringe area car parks, parking\r\n\r\nkiosks at these car parks, provision of new bus\r\n\r\nshelters, provision of daily area licence sale\r\n\r\nbooths and the erection of overhead gantry signs\r\n\r\nwhich are now all, over Singapore, as well as new\r\n\r\nroad direction signs. Contrary to what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Toa Payoh says, we expect a significant\r\n\r\nimprovement in traffic conditions `within the CBD\r\n\r\nfollowing the introduction of these two traffic\r\n\r\nmanagement measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various alternative methods of reducing the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  vehicles entering the CBD  during  the\r\n\r\npeak  periods have been examined before the  park-and-ride  and  the  area  licensing  schemes  were\r\n\r\nselected  as  being  the most  appropriate  and  \r\n\r\neffective  measures for Singapore. The Member  has\r\n\r\nindicated  one  method and there  are  also  other\r\n\r\nmethods  which  ,have  been  suggested,   like   - allowing vehicles with registration numbers ending\r\n\r\nin  odd  numbers  entering the  CBD  on  Mondays,\r\n\r\nWednesdays and Fridays, and those ending  in  even\r\n\r\nnumbers on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Toa Payoh did put in a\r\n\r\npaper  and  it  was studied by the Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAction  Committee. Unfortunately we have  to  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that  though his idea sounds very  simple  to\r\n\r\noperate,    there   are   three   major    serious\r\n\r\ndifficulties  when  it  comes  to  implementation.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it will place an automatic restriction of\r\n\r\nalmost  one  half of the car motoring public  and,\r\n\r\nwith   at   least   140,000  cars  registered   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, this means that 70,000 car owners  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to use those `cars: This is much  too\r\n\r\nhigh  a  level of restriction on the movement  of\r\n\r\nprivate  cars  for the time being. Secondly,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not provide such affected motorists with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenuine need or in an emergency to drive into  the\r\n\r\ncity  because they are not supposed to be  on  the\r\n\r\nroad.  So they just cannot move. Thirdly,  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme  will  affect  all  motorists  whereas  the\r\n\r\nproposed  area licensing scheme is only  aimed  at\r\n\r\nrestricting   car   drivers  from   entering   the\r\n\r\nrestricted  zone and not elsewhere. The restricted\r\n\r\nzone  is  effective only for this two-hour period,\r\n\r\nfrom  7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, in the morning,  thus\r\n\r\nhaving  a  very  minimum effect  on  business  and\r\n\r\ncommerce.  There is no restriction of  entry  into\r\n\r\nthe  restricted zone outside these two peak  hours\r\n\r\nin the morning. The area licensing scheme provides\r\n\r\noptions to motorists who wish to continue to drive\r\n\r\ninto  the restricted zone. It is not just for  the\r\n\r\nprivileged few. They can come in at no extra  cost\r\n\r\nprovided the car has at least four passengers.  In\r\n\r\nother words, we want to encourage them to form car\r\n\r\npools. Another alternative for motorists would  be\r\n\r\nto  participate in the park and ride  scheme,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who choose this scheme would do  so  at  an\r\n\r\neven  much cheaper cost than what they would  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  for  seasonal parking in the  city  area,\r\n\r\nbecause the cost of such seasonal parking could be\r\n\r\nanything from $50 to $70 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious and conscientious effort must therefore\r\n\r\nbe  made by all car owners for a more rational use\r\n\r\nof  our roads in the city. Motorists can choose to\r\n\r\npay for the privilege to drive into the restricted\r\n\r\narea  provided  they pay a price, or  help  reduce\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion through formation of car pools,\r\n\r\nor participate in the park and ride scheme, or opt\r\n\r\nfor  staggered hours outside the 7.30 a.m, to'9.30\r\n\r\na.m, time slot. Only those- and this is  a  small\r\n\r\nfraction  -  who  choose and who  must  enter  the\r\n\r\nrestricted zone during these two hours  will  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  price  which we would call  a  \"social\r\n\r\ncost\".  This  can be viewed as a  charge  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  required  to pay for part of  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstructing the 12 fringe area car parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, just a point of clarification.

It is only applicable during\r\n\r\nthe  peak  period,  and this will  meet  the  very\r\n\r\nobjective  that  we are aiming  at,  that  is,  to\r\n\r\nreduce the number of motor cars entering the  CBD.\r\n\r\nSo  my  present  plan  is a  modification  of  the\r\n\r\nearlier one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I wish to assure him that  this\r\n\r\nmatter  has been considered and that these  fringe\r\n\r\narea  car  parks which can hold as many as  10,000\r\n\r\ncars  will be economically used. They will be  let\r\n\r\nout  for  the parking of buses, lorries  and  even\r\n\r\ncars, if necessary, at a fee to be charged.

As\r\n\r\nregards   the   full   implementation    of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the White Paper which was meant\r\n\r\nto  be completed by the middle of 1973, I can only\r\n\r\nsay  that it was not a 100% implementation of  all\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations.  We  tried  as  far  as   we\r\n\r\npossibly  could, but many of the details have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  exactly implemented.

For some, it is probably moving\r\n\r\na  bit too fast for them. Perhaps it is better  to\r\n\r\nhasten slowly.

These were valid criticisms, but the rut\r\n\r\nthat  set  in had quite a lot to do with the  poor\r\n\r\norganisation and mismanagement as well. It  became\r\n\r\nevident  that to bring order out of chaos, drastic\r\n\r\nmeasures had to be taken to relieve commuters from\r\n\r\nthe  deplorable  inadequacies  and  inconveniences\r\n\r\nwhich they had to face. The Government stepped  in\r\n\r\nand  with  the  advent of the Government  team  of\r\n\r\nofficers there have been significant improvements.\r\n\r\nClose   cooperation  between   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications, the union and the  new  management\r\n\r\nhas  cleared up a messy situation with the  active\r\n\r\nparticipation of the workers. The contribution  of\r\n\r\nthe union with the support of the bus workers must\r\n\r\nnot  go  unheeded.  From a  ragged  lot,  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers have found a new dignity as co-partners in\r\n\r\nimproving  the public bus transport system.  Terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions of employment have  also  improved\r\n\r\nand the new management has taken cognisance of the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, all in all, the improvements have been\r\n\r\ngenerally  satisfactory, I  would  call  upon  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  to also take cognisance  of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the mechanics, timekeepers, bus drivers  and\r\n\r\nconductors   are  the  people  who  are   directly\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  keeping the fleet of  buses  running\r\n\r\nwell  on time and earning revenue for the company.\r\n\r\nThey are, in other words, collectively responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the smooth and efficient operation of the bus\r\n\r\nservices,     and     they     shoulder      great\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.    The    management     should,\r\n\r\ntherefore, consider them on an equal footing  with\r\n\r\nother employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a few other areas which require\r\n\r\nconsideration. During peak hours, bus workers have\r\n\r\nto  work under great stress and strain. When buses\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull, it sometimes happens that buses will  have\r\n\r\nto   overshoot  bus  stops  to  prevent  commuters\r\n\r\ngathered  in large numbers from pushing their  way\r\n\r\nin.  The commuters ,have also ,to develop a  sense\r\n\r\nof  discipline  by  queuing up at  bus  stops  and\r\n\r\nrefraining  to  enter buses which  are  full  when\r\n\r\nrequested  to  do  so  by the conductor.  In  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is unfair and unjust for  anyone\r\n\r\nto pin the blame on bus conductors and drivers who\r\n\r\narc  responsible for the safety and comfort of the\r\n\r\npassengers.  There  are also  instances  when  any\r\n\r\ncommuters are uncivil to bus conductors. These are\r\n\r\nprobably  the normal hazards of the job, hut  they\r\n\r\ncan be made tolerable if greater understanding  is\r\n\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of bus terminals, the situation is far\r\n\r\nfrom  satisfactory.  In  other  cities  large  bus\r\n\r\nterminals  with adequate facilities  exist.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Toa  Payoh bus terminal, there  are  no\r\n\r\nproper bus terminals in Singapore where buses  can\r\n\r\nbe  parked  in clearly demarcated bays or  various\r\n\r\nroutes.   This   would   facilitate   the   proper\r\n\r\nidentification  of buses and orderly  boarding  by\r\n\r\ncommuters. I suggest that the provision of  proper\r\n\r\nbus    terminals    should   be    given    urgent\r\n\r\nconsideration, and that consideration should  also\r\n\r\nbe given in development projects for the provision\r\n\r\nof   bus   terminals  with  reasonably  sufficient\r\n\r\nfacilities for canteens and sanitary needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the SBS which was, formed in\r\n\r\nNovember  1973  is  easily  the  biggest   private\r\n\r\ncompany   with  a  work  force  of   about   9,000\r\n\r\nemployees.

We all know that  SBS\r\n\r\nis  formed  out of ten small Chinese bus companies\r\n\r\nwhich  were,  managed on a family  basis.  So  the\r\n\r\ncompany has to face a lot of problems. During  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of the last seven months in which  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen involved in the reorganisation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite a bit has, been done for the welfare of  the\r\n\r\nbus workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of standard procedures and\r\n\r\nsystems   has  to  a  great  extent  reduced   the\r\n\r\nunhappiness  of the bus workers. The company  has\r\n\r\nalso  provided  better  working  environment   and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities for the bus workers.  The\r\n\r\nfollowing  are some of the measures taken  by  the\r\n\r\ncompany to improve the working conditions  of  the\r\n\r\nbus workers as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Common procedures for recruitment and\r\n\r\nselection of personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Standard office hours for the various bus\r\n\r\ndepots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Standardised daily wage deductions for bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  conductors were also implemented  in\r\n\r\nall  the depots, thereby making it much easier for\r\n\r\nreconciliation  of  wages. The  company  has  also\r\n\r\ntried  its best to encourage thrift among the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers  by  contributing $5 to each POSB  savings\r\n\r\naccount opened by the bus workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The recommendation `of the NWC on wage\r\n\r\nincreases  was also implemented for  all  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this has boosted up the morale of the bus\r\n\r\n`workers  to  a great extent and the  bus  workers\r\n\r\nhave responded very well except a few. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the salary scale mentioned by the Member for Boon\r\n\r\nTeck,  I  would like to inform the House that  the\r\n\r\nbus   company   right  now   is   drawing   up   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  salary scale for all SBS  employees\r\n\r\nso  as  to  keep  them informed  of  their  career\r\n\r\nprospects in the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the point of the bus terminus, it is\r\n\r\nquite true that we are still short of satisfactory\r\n\r\nbus  terminus  owing to various  reasons,  one  of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  shortage of land.

We are, in fact, subsidising the\r\n\r\nmanagement of SBS. Considering that the Government\r\n\r\nmust  have spent vast sums of money over the years\r\n\r\nto `train these people, I think\" a more reasonable\r\n\r\ndeal would be that Government gets a share in  the\r\n\r\nprofits -subject to a figure not less than 150% of\r\n\r\nthe amount expended.

I think  it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nunique and unprecedented move to second more  than\r\n\r\n100  officers from Government and our Armed Forces\r\n\r\nto help a private limited company like SBS. It has\r\n\r\nbeen   done  by  Government  purely  because   for\r\n\r\nhistorical  reasons an essential  public  service,\r\n\r\nlike the bus service, is in the hands of a private\r\n\r\ncompany. If it were riot for this, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe Government would lift a finger.

Before  the\r\n\r\nNeptune  Ruby  incident there were no  reports  of\r\n\r\ninterference with NOL ships although, prior to the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of  the  Board  of  inquiry   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Labour,  in  February\r\n\r\n1973 to look into the dispute between the Maritime\r\n\r\nEmployers and the Singapore Seamen's Organisation,\r\n\r\nthere  were  a  number of reports of  interference\r\n\r\nwith ships, both Singapore and foreign registered,\r\n\r\nin  which  Singapore seamen were employed  by  the\r\n\r\nAustralian Waterside Workers' Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Neptune Ruby was brought into commission\r\n\r\nin  August  1972, she  was  manned  by  Singapore\r\n\r\nofficers and crew. However, as the vessel  was  on\r\n\r\nlong-term  charter to a Japanese shipping  company\r\n\r\nwhose    routes   were   Japan,   Australia    and\r\n\r\nsubsequently Japan Caribbean ports, NOL  made  the\r\n\r\ndecision  to  employ Filipino crew on the  Neptune\r\n\r\nRuby with the change of Articles for the seamen in\r\n\r\nAugust  1973.  The decision was taken  while  they\r\n\r\nwere   on   vessels  which  do   not   call   back\r\n\r\nperiodically  at Singapore which are  not  popular\r\n\r\nwith  our  seafarers, and have in the  past  given\r\n\r\nrise  to  problems of crew morale, and discipline.\r\n\r\nWhen the Neptune Ruby arrived in Melbourne on 20th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1975, one Filipino electrician on board,\r\n\r\nwho  was  to be replaced on disciplinary  grounds,\r\n\r\ndid approach the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustralian   Waterside  Workers  Federation   for\r\n\r\nassistance.

The Singapore International Airport  is\r\n\r\nthe  place  that  gives the  passenger  his  first\r\n\r\nimpression  on  arrival  and  last  impression  on\r\n\r\ndeparture.  On arrival a passenger is  immediately\r\n\r\naccorded all the facilities and services. But when\r\n\r\nhe  leaves,  the good impression that  he  had  on\r\n\r\narrival  would be rudely disturbed when he finally\r\n\r\nboards the plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans and tourists alike leave\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  all  times  of  the  day  via   the\r\n\r\nSingapore International Airport. During  the  peak\r\n\r\nhours  the  check-in counters are very  congested,\r\n\r\nand  the  passengers  have to  squeeze  their  way\r\n\r\nthrough  the crowds of well-wishers. The  check-in\r\n\r\nsometimes  takes as long as 30 to 45 minutes,  and\r\n\r\nduring  this time the passengers have to  wait  in\r\n\r\ndiscomfort.  Not  only  is  this  area   extremely\r\n\r\ninadequate  to  cater for the  growing  number  of\r\n\r\npassengers but the atmosphere is also humid  which\r\n\r\nthe passengers have to endure before clearance. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, this check-in area is not air-conditioned.\r\n\r\nBut  it is ironical to note that the electric fans\r\n\r\non  the  pillars should be directed at  the  staff\r\n\r\nbehind the counters, instead of at the passengers.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  the passengers are paying  a  service\r\n\r\ncharge  of $10 which is the highest rate  in  this\r\n\r\npart of the world. Furthermore, they are also made\r\n\r\nto feel the discomfort of the weather should there\r\n\r\nbe a shower at this area, which is not partitioned\r\n\r\noff.  To  improve the situation, it  is  suggested\r\n\r\nthat immediate action should be taken to partition\r\n\r\noff  the  frontage and air-condition the area.  By\r\n\r\ndoing so, it will reduce the noise pollution  from\r\n\r\nthe traffic outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the main concourse passengers are\r\n\r\nagain faced with the over-crowded area because  of\r\n\r\nthe  congestion.

Some of  the  areas  in  the\r\n\r\nterminal  were  constructed  to  cater  for  small\r\n\r\ndomestic  flights  years ago. But  with  the  fast\r\n\r\ngrowing air traffic and with affluent Singaporeans\r\n\r\ngoing  abroad, the Singapore International Airport\r\n\r\nshould  expand and provide all necessary  services\r\n\r\nand  facilities to cater for the growing needs  of\r\n\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We  have come  to  a  stage  where\r\n\r\npersons   cannot  even  send  off  their   friends\r\n\r\nproperly.  Our  airport must be  one  of  the  few\r\n\r\ninternational  airports in  the  world  without  a\r\n\r\nwaving  gallery. As a result, the waiting hail  is\r\n\r\nso   congested.   At  times,  the   situation   is\r\n\r\nunbearable for those who wait in the hall. I would\r\n\r\nlike to invite the Minister to see for himself the\r\n\r\nsituation  at  the airport when the  pilgrims  are\r\n\r\nbeing  sent  off to Mecca, or at any  other  time.\r\n\r\nWhat   an  impression  we  are  creating  to   the\r\n\r\ndeparting tourists, who have to squeeze their  way\r\n\r\nthrough a mass of humanity in order to get to  the\r\n\r\ndeparture  gate. It was only a year ago  that  the\r\n\r\nwaving gallery was opened, and yet so soon it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  closed. Why has there been bad  planning  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of the Airport authorities?  The  seats\r\n\r\nprovided  are shockingly few. Would  it  cost  too\r\n\r\nmuch, or would it be too much to provide some more\r\n\r\nseats?

But  it\r\n\r\nseems  that only $20,000 was spent. This year  the\r\n\r\nallocation  is ten times the amount  allocated  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year.  It  seems  to  me  that  the\r\n\r\nresurfacing of the existing runway was not carried\r\n\r\nout  last  year, it is no wonder that  the  Pilots\r\n\r\nAssociation remarked that Singapore Airport is one\r\n\r\nof  the worst as far as runway is concerned. It is\r\n\r\nbumpy  and  uneven. This is very  bad.  Surely  an\r\n\r\ninternational  airport in this  particular  region\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to have a bumpy and uneven  surface\r\n\r\nfor  its runway. Now, may I ask if this allocation\r\n\r\nof  $2,580,000 is going to be utilized  this  year\r\n\r\nfor  resurfacing the runway?

Out of this, a sum of\r\n\r\n$1,960,000  is  being revoted for this  year.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  for  a  new Passenger Terminal  was  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1974 and $2,990,000 is being  revoted\r\n\r\nfor  this year~ that means only $10,000 was spent.\r\n\r\nThe  provision for the new Boeing 747  Hangar  was\r\n\r\n$7,000,000 last year and the amount to be  revoted\r\n\r\nthis  year  is $6,400,000. I do not know  why  the\r\n\r\nrevotes  are  reducing when costs  are  going  up.\r\n\r\nAirport  Fire  Service, fire substation  $400,000,\r\n\r\nrevote $400,000. Not a single cent was spent. Now,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  really going on at the airport?  Are  we\r\n\r\ntaking  votes and getting revotes or is  any  work\r\n\r\nreally  being carried out at the airport?  Surely,\r\n\r\nwhen estimates are given a certain sum of money is\r\n\r\nrequired, and the money must be utilized. I  think\r\n\r\nsomething is definitely wrong somewhere.  So  many\r\n\r\nrevotes are being made. Obviously the money is not\r\n\r\nbeing  used  and,  therefore, work  is  not  being\r\n\r\ncarried out at the airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a reply to a certain Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nin  the  previous year the Minister stated that  a\r\n\r\nsecond terminal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be required for the Airport at Paya  Lebar.\r\n\r\nNow,  with  this decrease in tourist  traffic,  is\r\n\r\nthis terminal building still under review? Or  are\r\n\r\nwe  going  ahead  with  the  construction  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding,  irrespective of  the  decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of tourist traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Economic Survey of Singapore for 1974\r\n\r\nit   is  stated  that  the  tourist  traffic   has\r\n\r\nincreased a great deal as compared to the previous\r\n\r\nyear.  What  I  want  to know  is  this:  is  this\r\n\r\nincrease brought about by traffic through the Port\r\n\r\nor  Airport  or  the Causeway?  Or  is  there  any\r\n\r\ndecrease in traffic in any particular terminal? If\r\n\r\nso, why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Airlines has indicated that it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to purchase a number of jumbo jets to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  tourist traffic. May I  know  if  these\r\n\r\njumbo jets have already been purchased, or is  the\r\n\r\npurchase  still in SIA's mind? If so,  may  1  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  it is a wise move to purchase them  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when tourist traffic is declining throughout\r\n\r\nthe  whole  world,  because of increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nfreight,  fuel  charges,  and  increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and operations of standard  aircraft.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  what  guarantee is  there  that  our\r\n\r\ntourist traffic will increase in future because of\r\n\r\nworld inflationary trends?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I too want to speak about the voting and\r\n\r\nrevoting  of Development Estimates in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  Paya  Lebar Airport. Though it has been  well\r\n\r\ncovered  by the Member for Anson, I would like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that I also looked through the Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  last financial year which  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson did not look  up.  Last  year's\r\n\r\nestimates were revoted from the year before  last.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  next  year we would not  have  to  revote\r\n\r\nagain,  and instead the lack of improvements  that\r\n\r\nwere  complained of by the Members for  Anson  and\r\n\r\nKampung Kapur would have been carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nregrettably true that after many of the  estimates\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar Airport had been voted, revotes had\r\n\r\nto be asked for. The reason is that it has taken a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong  time  to get all these development proposals\r\n\r\nstarted.  They  are development proposals  really,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  plans have got to be drawn and checked.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, of course, costs have gone  up  and\r\n\r\nthen  we have to seek approval of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance before we can proceed with tenders and  so\r\n\r\non.  And  this has been going on over a period  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> But the revotes are being reduced. The Minister\r\n\r\nsays that costs have increased. Why is it that the\r\n\r\nrevotes are reducing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Well, it is not as simple as building a house\r\n\r\nwhich could probably be done in a few months,  and\r\n\r\neverything  is  over.  Most of  these  development\r\n\r\nprojects  are of a continuing nature  and  stretch\r\n\r\nover  a  number  of years. So if the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance feels that a particular project would take\r\n\r\nfive  years  to  complete and that  for  the  next\r\n\r\nfinancial year it is possible to spend,  say  only\r\n\r\none-fifth  of that amount, that is all  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  allocate for that item. I do not think it  a\r\n\r\nmystery  for  certain figures to shrink  in  size,\r\n\r\nbecause  physically neither the Ministry  nor  the\r\n\r\ncontractors will be able to make full use  of  the\r\n\r\nfunds  that  have  been  allocated.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nposition,   and  I  think  it  also  answers   the\r\n\r\ncriticism   of  the  Member  for  Telok   Blangah.\r\n\r\nInvariably,   the  provision  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  is  not  fully spent  and  the  unspent\r\n\r\namount  need to be revoted, because if we  do  not\r\n\r\nask for a revote, then we would not get it at all.\r\n\r\nWe  are lucky if we even have a $10 token vote  to\r\n\r\nkeep  it  alive. So I do not think the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson need be too excited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for low spending, and perhaps sometimes of\r\n\r\nover-estimation, are as follows.  There  has  been\r\n\r\ndelay  in  the clearance and resettlement  of  the\r\n\r\naffected  squatters  on  those  sites  which   are\r\n\r\nrequired  for development projects. I  think  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  affected  areas, like  Punggol   and\r\n\r\nTampines, will understand the situation. We do not\r\n\r\njust  evict the squatters. It is not just evicting\r\n\r\none  squatter  but hundreds of them and  sometimes\r\n\r\nthousands, and we begin to move and hasten slowly.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  hindrance  from  squatters,  the\r\n\r\nnecessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsite  preparation work and piling work  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone as anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the projects are being partly financed by\r\n\r\nthe  Asian Development Bank in Manila. And we have\r\n\r\nto go through lengthy administrative clearances to\r\n\r\nget  their  approval  before a particular  project\r\n\r\ncould get off the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, technical and staffing difficulties are\r\n\r\nencountered  in  the preparation of  specification\r\n\r\nand  contract documents. For example, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the long range surveillance radar project  and\r\n\r\nthe  ticketing wing extension, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampung Kapur, and conversion  of  the\r\n\r\nformer   postal  sorting  office  all  these   are\r\n\r\ninvolved in development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, technical problems arise affecting the\r\n\r\ncommissioning  of  equipment  and  radar   already\r\n\r\npurchased  and  installed.  We  are  still  having\r\n\r\ndifficulties,   teething   troubles,   that   need\r\n\r\nadjustments, and this takes time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, delay in the finalisation of detailed\r\n\r\ndesign  drawings  on  tendered  documents  by  the\r\n\r\nappointed   consultants, the   Northrop   Airport\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Corporation,  for  the   Boeing   747\r\n\r\nhangar, the new air freight terminal building, the\r\n\r\nfire   station  and  the  new  passenger  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding and the new parking apron. All these  are\r\n\r\npart   and  parcel  of  the  multi-million  dollar\r\n\r\nprojects which take not just months but years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all I can say is that every effort has been\r\n\r\nmade to get the development projects done. As  can\r\n\r\nbe   seen,  once  the  Development  Planning  Sub-Committee  approves  the plans certain  procedures\r\n\r\nhave to be complied with, and this takes time. But\r\n\r\nevery effort is being made to get them through  as\r\n\r\nquickly  as  possible. These development  projects\r\n\r\namount to $21.6 million in this case. I think that\r\n\r\nis  about  all I can answer really to the question\r\n\r\nof  why there is so much money but nothing appears\r\n\r\nto  be moving. Lots of things are moving. That  it\r\n\r\nmoves rather slowly, I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's explanation, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (5).

It is responsible for  the  timely\r\n\r\ntransmission  and  delivery  of  mail.   Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  and to be fair, I would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nPostal Services have improved over the years.  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  of course, there  are  still  some\r\n\r\nshortcomings  which  need to  be  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nattention   of   the  Minister.  The  shortcomings\r\n\r\ninclude the delay or late delivery of letters.  In\r\n\r\nmy  personal experience sometime ago I had to wait\r\n\r\nfor  three  days  for a Government  letter  to  be\r\n\r\ndelivered  to me. Apparently there had  been  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable delay. Delivery of local mail  should\r\n\r\nbe effected overnight. So I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  look into this matter and ensure that delays\r\n\r\nshould  be minimised, if not entirely avoided.  If\r\n\r\nit  is  because  of  traffic congestion  or  staff\r\n\r\nproblems, I think something can be done  to  solve\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that certain postmen have not\r\n\r\nconducted  themselves very well. I  have  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints from my constituents that some  postmen\r\n\r\nsimply throw the letters about, instead of putting\r\n\r\nthem into the letter boxes or handing them through\r\n\r\nthe  doorway. Very often these letters are  thrown\r\n\r\non  the five-foot way or the corridor, This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  way of delivering letters  because  the\r\n\r\nletters  would  then become soiled or  mislaid.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will look into the matter  and\r\n\r\ntake remedial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going to complain about\r\n\r\nthe  postmen  because they have a  difficult  job.\r\n\r\nAmong the Division IV employees, the postman's job\r\n\r\nis  the most difficult one. Everyone must remember\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am going to talk about postwomen. It\r\n\r\nwas proudly publicised recently that postwomen are\r\n\r\nnow   being   employed  by  the  Postal   Services\r\n\r\nDepartment   as   part   of   the   reorganisation\r\n\r\nprogramme. It has been observed that some of these\r\n\r\npostwomen   look   more  like  school   girls   in\r\n\r\nkindergarten  uniforms. Recruiting  them  make  us\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  they  can take  the  place  of  the\r\n\r\npostmen.  But the postman has to carry a  35-pound\r\n\r\nbag.  How can we ask the postwoman to carry a  bag\r\n\r\nof the same weight? For a policewoman, we normally\r\n\r\nsee her standing on duty. But not the postwoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had been working in the Postal Department,\r\n\r\nand  my shoulder level has dropped by half an inch\r\n\r\non  one side because of carrying the post bag.  My\r\n\r\ntailor  also told me that one of my shoulders  has\r\n\r\ndropped a little. So if we ask the postwoman to do\r\n\r\nthe  same  job, it would be unfair. There  are  so\r\n\r\nmany  jobs in the Postal Department which  can  be\r\n\r\nallotted  to them. Do not give equal  job  to  the\r\n\r\npostwomen,  but give them equal pay, even  if  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Services  Department has to  employ  post-women to meet the shortage of postmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister enlighten the House whether\r\n\r\nany specific requirements are spelt out in respect\r\n\r\nof  height, build and weight when a recruitment is\r\n\r\ncarried  out? Is the Minister aware that a  number\r\n\r\nof  these  postwomen are not able to ride bicycles\r\n\r\nmade  available to them because they  cannot  even\r\n\r\nreach the bicycle pedal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also observed that these girls often hold\r\n\r\nthe  peak cap in one hand when delivering mail  in\r\n\r\nthe  street.  This could be because they  want  to\r\n\r\nshield  their faces from recognition,  or  because\r\n\r\nthey  are embarrassed having to put on the awkward\r\n\r\nlooking peak cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us whether the present\r\n\r\npostwomen are as efficient and able as the postmen\r\n\r\nin the sorting and delivering of mail? Is the work\r\n\r\nof  the  postwomen as demanding  as  that  of  the\r\n\r\npostmen? Are we not a party to the hazard faced by\r\n\r\nthese girls on the dangerous roads?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I must congratulate the Member for Anson for\r\n\r\nbeing  so  chivalrous  at his  age,  watching  and\r\n\r\nobserving the behaviour of our post-women.  He  is\r\n\r\ncertainly a young man at heart!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the high turnover in the postman's\r\n\r\ngrade and to provide more employment opportunities\r\n\r\nfor our women in the Republic, the Postal Services\r\n\r\nDepartment  made  the move to  recruit  postwomen.\r\n\r\nThey  have  been recruited through the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange.  In  view of the nature of their  duties\r\n\r\nthe  Special Committee in the Ministry  of  Labour\r\n\r\nhas  been  requested  to  supply  candidates  with\r\n\r\nrobust physique for appointment to this grade.  At\r\n\r\npresent there are 18 postwomen in service,  and  I\r\n\r\nmay  as  well  indicate where they are;  otherwise\r\n\r\nevery  one  will  think  that  our  postwomen  are\r\n\r\ncarrying  mails.  Eight are  on  bicycle  delivery\r\n\r\nbeats.  As it has been indicated that some of  the\r\n\r\nbicycles are probably too high for them, we  hope\r\n\r\nat the next financial year to get bicycles fit for\r\n\r\nwomen; probably half the size if the postwomen are\r\n\r\nof  small stature. In the mail collection section,\r\n\r\nthere  is one on van driving duty; parcel delivery\r\n\r\nduty,  one;  indoor duty at the Mails and  Parcels\r\n\r\nCentre.  Nelson  Road,  one;  and  seven  on  foot\r\n\r\ndelivery beats. The complaint is that they have to\r\n\r\ncarry  too heavy mail bags. The Postmaster-General\r\n\r\nhas  indicated that these bags will be reduced  in\r\n\r\nsize to suit their physique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the peak caps, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\ncomplains  that they are holding them  instead  of\r\n\r\nwearing  them. These are interim arrangements  and\r\n\r\naction  is being taken by the Department to supply\r\n\r\nour postwomen with suitable peak caps, similar  to\r\n\r\nthose used by the Republic's policewomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that all our post-women who have\r\n\r\nbeen  recruited are generally satisfied with their\r\n\r\njob  and working conditions.

He\r\n\r\nexpressed concern for the delay in the delivery of\r\n\r\nmails.  Delays  in delivery can happen  under  the\r\n\r\nfollowing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, incomplete, poor or illegible addressing\r\n\r\nof  mail.  Incorrect addressing of  mail  includes\r\n\r\nwriting   the   wrong  postal   district   number.\r\n\r\nSometimes, due to seasonal peak periods, it  takes\r\n\r\na  bit  longer to deliver mail than for  a  normal\r\n\r\nday. Of course, it is possible that our own postal\r\n\r\nworkers  could  have put the mail into  the  wrong\r\n\r\nsorting  box,  and hence incorrectly delivered  by\r\n\r\nthe  delivery postmen. Under normal circumstances,\r\n\r\nmails  can  take up from two to three days  to  be\r\n\r\ndelivered to the correct address, if posted  on  a\r\n\r\nFriday,  Saturday  or  on  the  eve  of  a  public\r\n\r\nholiday.  Normally  it  is  possible  to  have  an\r\n\r\novernight delivery, if posted in Singapore. I have\r\n\r\nalready explained how it is possible for mails  to\r\n\r\nbe delivered late for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, perhaps I might say that the\r\n\r\nPostal Services Department has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  workforce of only 400 postmen, and they have to\r\n\r\ndeliver  no  less than 173 million items  of  mail\r\n\r\neach  year,  or  an average of more  than  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  items  each  day.  Errors  may  therefore\r\n\r\noccur,  as  in the postal service of any  country.\r\n\r\nThis does not, of course, mean that inefficient or\r\n\r\nirresponsible  mail delivery is  condoned  by  our\r\n\r\nPostal  Services  Department.  So  if  there   are\r\n\r\ncomplaints   I  would  appreciate   it   if   such\r\n\r\ncomplaints are lodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there have been no complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  Sembawang constituency for a long time.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang, however, did mention  about\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy on the part of postmen in the delivery\r\n\r\nof  mail. He said that they threw the mail on  the\r\n\r\nfloor.  Here again, unless a complaint is  lodged,\r\n\r\nwe  can do little about it because all postmen and\r\n\r\npostwomen  are  being told how to  behave  and  to\r\n\r\nextend courtesy, and what the correct procedure is\r\n\r\nand  methods of delivery of mail. If  we  get  any\r\n\r\nreport  of  improper conduct on the  part  of  our\r\n\r\npostmen or postwomen, it would initially take  the\r\n\r\nform  of caution if found guilty, and such conduct\r\n\r\nwill  be  noted  down.  If the  postman  concerned\r\n\r\nshould  persistently repeat these  irregularities,\r\n\r\nhe will be considered for more severe disciplinary\r\n\r\naction   under  the  Public  Service  Disciplinary\r\n\r\nProceedings (Delegation of Functions) Rules, 1970,\r\n\r\nor  the  Public  Service Disciplinary  Regulations\r\n\r\n1970, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy, Chin Harn Tong, N. Govindasamy and Ivan Baptist).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two points to raise. First, I would\r\n\r\nlike to refer to the question of smoky buses. Last\r\n\r\nyear  the  Minister posed the problem - either  we\r\n\r\nhave  smoky buses to carry passengers or  we  look\r\n\r\nafter  the smoky exhausts and have fewer buses  on\r\n\r\nthe  road.  The  inevitable  answer  to  that,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  was  that  we had to  have  smoky  buses.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  am  sure that by this time,  after  a\r\n\r\npassage  of one year and with so many improvements\r\n\r\nin  the bus service, this problem would have  been\r\n\r\nsolved  to  some extent. It is important  that  we\r\n\r\ntake  a more and more serious view of the presence\r\n\r\nof  smoky  buses on the road. Tolerance  of  lower\r\n\r\nstandards   of  control  of  emission  of   smoke,\r\n\r\nespecially where SBS is concerned, means retarding\r\n\r\nthe  progress of our anti-pollution campaign.  How\r\n\r\ncan we take measures against one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector  for  air pollution and do not take  proper\r\n\r\nmeasures against another sector?\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give one illustration of smoke on the road, one\r\n\r\nneed  only  to  take the instance  of  our  school\r\n\r\nchildren jogging by the side of the road  as  part\r\n\r\nof    their   extra-curricular   activities.   Not\r\n\r\ninfrequently   I   have  noticed   passing   heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles, mostly buses, emitting smoke right  into\r\n\r\nthe  midst of these children doing their exercise.\r\n\r\nHow healthy is it for such children to breathe  in\r\n\r\nheavily  polluted atmosphere on the road?  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  action has indeed been taken in  respect  of\r\n\r\nsmoky buses. If fines have been imposed on the SBS\r\n\r\nfor  smoky  buses,  further  penalties  should  be\r\n\r\nimposed. They are making money. So I think we  can\r\n\r\nbe strict in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter, I would like to\r\n\r\ndraw the attention of the Registrar of Vehicles to\r\n\r\nthe  inadequate enforcement of traffic regulations\r\n\r\nin   respect   of   heavy   commercial   vehicles,\r\n\r\nespecially Malaysian registered vehicles. In  many\r\n\r\nplaces in Singapore, especially along Dunearn Road\r\n\r\nand  Bukit  Timah  Road,  large  lorries  carrying\r\n\r\ntimber and vegetables at all times of the day,  do\r\n\r\nnot pay any heed to traffic regulations. They know\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  get away with it  because  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  impose measures against  them.  The\r\n\r\nmore  they  realise this, the more  flagrantly  do\r\n\r\nthey  flout  the  law. I do  not  think  that  any\r\n\r\nvigorous action taken against these vehicles  will\r\n\r\nnecessarily sour up relations with Malaysia, for I\r\n\r\nam sure they are not allowed to behave in this way\r\n\r\non  their own roads in Malaysia. May I, therefore,\r\n\r\nurge the competent authority to take proper action\r\n\r\nagainst  these  vehicles to discourage  them  from\r\n\r\nthis insolent act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a certain\r\n\r\nproblem  relating  to the taxi  drivers.  The  ROV\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  are  very discourteous  in  their\r\n\r\nattitude  towards taxi drivers,  and  have  always\r\n\r\nmade things difficult for them. They are very rude\r\n\r\nand always carry out spot-checks on taxis. They do\r\n\r\nnot want to listen to the complaints of the taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrivers.  And  while checking the taxis,  if  they\r\n\r\ncannot  find any fault with the engine, they  will\r\n\r\nsay  that the taxi is emitting obnoxious smoke and\r\n\r\nthen  order the taxi driver to drive his  taxi  to\r\n\r\nthe  ROV  compound for a further check there.  And\r\n\r\nonly  if they cannot find anything wrong with  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  will they allow the taxi driver to go  home.\r\n\r\nThus, the taxi drivers have wasted their time  and\r\n\r\nas  a result lost their earnings. Is it reasonable\r\n\r\nto treat the taxi drivers in this way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past I have also complained about spot-checking of taxis by the Traffic Police. Taxis\r\n\r\nhave  to be inspected and checked every six months\r\n\r\nif  they are to ply on the road. This is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  every  taxi  on  the  road  is  in  a  sound\r\n\r\ncondition. If the Traffic Police continues to spot\r\n\r\ncheck  taxis  all the time, this is tantamount  to\r\n\r\ncreating  difficulties for the  taxi  drivers.  We\r\n\r\nshould not allow this to go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is that the\r\n\r\nROV  Traffic Police have been unreasonable towards\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers. One taxi driver complained to me one\r\n\r\nday  that  he received a summons from the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice stating that he had committed three traffic\r\n\r\noffences. One of the charges was that the taxi was\r\n\r\nparked in a taxi stand. If a taxi is not parked at\r\n\r\na  taxi  stand, where else can it be  parked?  The\r\n\r\nsecond  charge  was  that  the  taxi  driver   had\r\n\r\nswitched  off his taxi meter. He told  me  that  a\r\n\r\npassenger  wanted to go to a shop to buy something\r\n\r\nand  the  taxi meter then showed the  fare  to  be\r\n\r\n$1.80 and as he was supposed to be waiting he  was\r\n\r\nnot  supposed to switch off the meter.  The  third\r\n\r\ncharge  was  that the taxi driver was not  sitting\r\n\r\ninside the taxi while waiting. He was at that time\r\n\r\nstanding  by the taxi. There was no need  for  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  to worry about the  taxi  \"flying\r\n\r\noff\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the taxi driver received such a summons with\r\n\r\nall  these  unreasonable charges,  he  was  really\r\n\r\nflabbergasted.  He  went at once  to  the  ROV  to\r\n\r\nexplain the situation and the officer accepted his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplanation to withdraw the summons but he  wanted\r\n\r\nthe taxi driver to go to court to have the summons\r\n\r\nsquashed. This means that half a day's earning  is\r\n\r\nlost  for the poor taxi driver. These unreasonable\r\n\r\ncharges  and  summonses  are  quite  numerous.   I\r\n\r\nattribute  this to the fact that some of  the  ROV\r\n\r\nTraffic  Policemen are either  not  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nregulations  or they are just deliberately  trying\r\n\r\nto  he difficult with the taxi drivers. That being\r\n\r\nthe  case I would like to ask the Minister to look\r\n\r\ninto  the matter very seriously and to get rid  of\r\n\r\nall the black sheep in the ROV Traffic Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have told me that\r\n\r\nthere  are far too few taxis in Singapore. I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  quite  possible  because  from  personal\r\n\r\nexperience  I have to wait for a taxi for  a  very\r\n\r\nlong time. On several occasions I have to wait for\r\n\r\nas  long as 15 to 30 minutes before I could get  a\r\n\r\ntaxi. I have also come across empty taxis refusing\r\n\r\nto  pick up fares even if they were to raise their\r\n\r\nhand to request the drivers to stop. There are yet\r\n\r\nother  taxi  drivers who stop in response  to  the\r\n\r\nhand  signal  but they say that they cannot  drive\r\n\r\nthe  passengers to certain places. So  again  they\r\n\r\nrefuse to pick up the fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not allow this\r\n\r\nsituation  to  continue. The  authority  concerned\r\n\r\nshould exercise greater control over taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  it  is  my considered  opinion  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  real shortage of taxis in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  one does not have to wait for  so  long\r\n\r\nbefore one can get a taxi. For the convenience  of\r\n\r\nthe  general  public.  I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nconsider issuing more taxi licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, lorries carrying sand, earth or\r\n\r\ngranite  chips  quite often spill  their  contents\r\n\r\nonto  the  road. This is not only a very dangerous\r\n\r\npractice  but  it also dirties the road  as  well.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these granite chips may even  shatter\r\n\r\nthe  windscreen of a passing car and thereby cause\r\n\r\nunnecessary  accident.  It  is  high   time   that\r\n\r\nlegislation  was  introduced to provide  that  all\r\n\r\nlorries carrying earth, sand or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranite chips should be covered with tarpaulin, as\r\n\r\nis  the  practice of all lorries carrying rubbish.\r\n\r\nIt is not a very difficult piece of legislation to\r\n\r\nintroduce.  Neither is it going to  cost  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal to these transport operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the introduction of the bus lane, how\r\n\r\nmany  persons  have  been prosecuted  so  far  for\r\n\r\ncausing  obstruction during the peak  period?  Far\r\n\r\ntoo many drivers have violated this regulation  by\r\n\r\ndriving  in  bus  lanes and cause  obstruction  to\r\n\r\nbuses during the stipulated times. How far is this\r\n\r\nbeing controlled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the park and ride scheme is being monitored\r\n\r\nby  the  whole world. It is no doubt a  very  good\r\n\r\nscheme.  It is well thought and well planned.  How\r\n\r\nsuccessful  it will be is left to be seen.  It  is\r\n\r\nour  hone  that it will be a success. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Communications  must  be  congratulated  for\r\n\r\nintroducing  this  scheme  with  the   object   of\r\n\r\nreducing traffic congestion in the city during the\r\n\r\npeak   hours.  But  personally  I   have   a   few\r\n\r\nforebodings  about  the  park  and  ride   scheme.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  motorists entering the CBD between  7.30\r\n\r\na.m, and 9.30 a.m, have to pay a $3 entrance  fee\r\n\r\nper  vehicle.  Secondly,  businessmen  can  easily\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay  this amount  and  enter  the  CBD\r\n\r\nwithout  any trouble at all because all they  need\r\n\r\ndo  is  to show their receipt and claim the  money\r\n\r\nthat  they  have paid. So this partly defeats  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  Thirdly,  motorists  can  enter  the  CBD\r\n\r\nbefore  7.30 am, or after 9.30 am., and this  will\r\n\r\ncreate  congestion to the same degree  as  we  are\r\n\r\nexperiencing  now.  Although  we  can  charge  the\r\n\r\nmotorists $3 per vehicle when they enter the  city\r\n\r\narea,  what happens when they leave the city?  The\r\n\r\ncongestion  and the traffic jam will still  remain\r\n\r\nthe same. The problem is not solved. Should we not\r\n\r\nextend  this scheme? The scheme is no  doubt  very\r\n\r\ngood  in  concept but it has got  to  be  properly\r\n\r\nchecked.  Singaporeans are a  very  adaptable  and\r\n\r\nflexible  people. That is why we are a  successful\r\n\r\nnation. If 7.30 a.m, is the time for the scheme to\r\n\r\nbe  effective, then all one has to do is to go  to\r\n\r\nthe city either before 7.30 a.m, or after 9.30 am.\r\n\r\nHow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  cars will, in fact, be reduced in this  way?\r\n\r\nFurther,  aggravation  and  frustration  will   be\r\n\r\ncaused in the evening when people leave the  city.\r\n\r\nSo the congestion will still be there. If there is\r\n\r\nany  change,  it  will  be too  negligible  to  be\r\n\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many people in Singapore own cars as a status\r\n\r\nsymbol, and too many of them enter the city for no\r\n\r\nparticular  purpose.  Even  if  they  do  have   a\r\n\r\nparticular  purpose, it is of not much importance.\r\n\r\nWe  should  try and discourage people from  owning\r\n\r\ncars  and  we should discourage them from entering\r\n\r\nthe city unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I feel that the increased road tax\r\n\r\nis  not  a  proper deterrent to car ownership.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  far better to increase the tax  on  new\r\n\r\ncars so as to make it prohibitive to own a car. In\r\n\r\nthis way the increase in the number of cars can be\r\n\r\ncontrolled  to a greater extent, and those  people\r\n\r\nwho  buy cars as a status symbol would have second\r\n\r\nthoughts about doing so. Further, households  with\r\n\r\nmore than one car should pay a special tax on  the\r\n\r\nadditional   cars  that  they   own.   This   will\r\n\r\ndiscourage two-car or three-car families. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  trend in modern cities is to reduce vehicular\r\n\r\ntraffic  as much as possible and to give the  city\r\n\r\nback  to the pedestrian. Let us give our city back\r\n\r\nto the pedestrian to whom it rightly belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is now going to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the area licence fee for the  park  and\r\n\r\nride  scheme. All right, if everyone pays for  the\r\n\r\nlicence, what happens? The same congestion will be\r\n\r\nthere.  They will say, \"I will pay $60.\"  Everyone\r\n\r\nbuys the licence at $60. What happens? So what  is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister going to do to reduce congestion  of\r\n\r\ntraffic in the city areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, after having ruled for 16 years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  achieved  excellent  results   in\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  interest  of  the  people  in\r\n\r\ngeneral. However, it does not mean that there  are\r\n\r\nno shortcomings. In fact, if we are to look around\r\n\r\ncarefully, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be able to notice them clearly. One of  them\r\n\r\nrelates to the question of taxi-driving licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, at present there\r\n\r\nare  about  15,000 licensed taxi drivers  but  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  taxis on the roads is only  5,000.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  a few thousand people holding  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers' licences have little or no opportunity to\r\n\r\ndrive  taxis. Of course, I am not blaming the  ROV\r\n\r\nofficers  in charge for this situation.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  reason for this situation is that many  years\r\n\r\nago  the  Authorities concerned had not been  very\r\n\r\nstrict  in  the  issue of taxi drivers'  licences.\r\n\r\nSince  this  disproportionately excess  number  of\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers is evident, the ROV has got no reason\r\n\r\nnot  to face the issue squarely. Because of  this,\r\n\r\ncertain  problems have arisen. We  have  got  some\r\n\r\npeople who hold licences but are unemployed or are\r\n\r\nunable   to  get  taxis  to  drive  as  a   proper\r\n\r\noccupation, even if they want to. Secondly,  there\r\n\r\nare  people who already have a full-time  job  but\r\n\r\nbecause they also hold taxi drivers' licences they\r\n\r\ndo taxi driving as a part-time job. Thirdly, there\r\n\r\nare people who already have permanent jobs and  do\r\n\r\nnot  drive taxis at present but because they  hold\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers' licences they continue to hold such\r\n\r\nlicences  in case they may want to drive taxis  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  Perhaps, ROV officials are not  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  effects caused by such a situation.  And,  in\r\n\r\nfact, this is a situation which causes concern and\r\n\r\nsympathy. Those with full-time jobs and  who  take\r\n\r\nup  taxi driving as a part-time employment usually\r\n\r\ndo   so  after  their  full  day's  work.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, they are bound to be exhausted  and\r\n\r\ninefficient  in  their driving.  Their  consequent\r\n\r\nlack  of  concentration may pose  another  traffic\r\n\r\nhazard  on  the public thoroughfares. They  are  a\r\n\r\ndanger  to  themselves and  to  other  road  users\r\n\r\nbecause  they  may cause accidents, perhaps  fatal\r\n\r\naccidents  involving  their  passengers  or  other\r\n\r\npersons at any moment anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the Government\r\n\r\nlaunched  a  campaign to keep  Singapore  accident\r\n\r\nfree. The Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Communications has also frequently stressed on\r\n\r\nroad  safety. But surprisingly, nothing  has  been\r\n\r\ndone in respect of such part-time taxi drivers who\r\n\r\nmay  endanger  the lives of their  passengers  and\r\n\r\nother road users. On the other hand, because  some\r\n\r\ntaxis  are  taken  up  by  these  part-time   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers, those genuine taxi drivers who depend  on\r\n\r\ndriving  taxis  for  a  living  find  that   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  is  in  great jeopardy.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nunemployed,  and  cannot get any  taxis  to  drive\r\n\r\nbecause  there are more drivers than  taxis,  this\r\n\r\nsituation  induces  the taxi  owners  to  be  more\r\n\r\nhaughty  and  overbearing towards  them  and  even\r\n\r\nexploit  them, thus causing even greater  hardship\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\npropose  to the ROV that holders of taxi  drivers'\r\n\r\nlicences   who  have  other  forms  of   full-time\r\n\r\nemployment and who drive taxis as a part-time job,\r\n\r\nor those who hold taxi driving licences but do not\r\n\r\ndepend on taxi driving for a living, should not be\r\n\r\nallowed  to renew their licences after  expiry.  I\r\n\r\nalso  propose  that taxi owners who do  not  drive\r\n\r\ntheir   own  taxis  should  have  their   licences\r\n\r\ncancelled. This is to ensure that those  who  hold\r\n\r\ntaxi  licences but do not have taxis to drive have\r\n\r\na  chance to earn a living. If we can do this,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to look after the livelihood of  the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers more extensively and more fairly. Our\r\n\r\npolicy should be to help the majority in need, and\r\n\r\nnot to enrich those who are already well off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may read in the newspapers about complaints by\r\n\r\nsome  passengers. I have also received  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  some passengers that when they hail an empty\r\n\r\ntaxi,  the  taxi driver refuses to  stop.  We,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  agree that severe action should be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  those  taxi drivers who  refuse  to  stop\r\n\r\ntheir  taxis without good reasons. But  there  are\r\n\r\ncases when taxi drivers do not stop their vehicles\r\n\r\nfor some good reason. For example, when there is a\r\n\r\nchange  of  shifts  or when  they  are  called  by\r\n\r\ntelephone to fetch some passenger somewhere,  then\r\n\r\nthey will not be able to stop their vehicles half-way to pick up other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers.  So  when  a complaint  is  made,  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  authorities  do not  consider  all  these\r\n\r\nreasons.   They  invariably  condemn  these   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  for  the alleged offence of  refusing  to\r\n\r\npick  short-trip  passengers.  However,  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver's  argument is, \"Since I did not  stop  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  at  all how could I know that the  passenger\r\n\r\nwas  going  to take a short-journey?\" People  also\r\n\r\naccuse taxi drivers for refusing to pick up fares.\r\n\r\nBut  the drivers say, \"We are earning a living  on\r\n\r\nthe  road,  so  why should we refuse  to  pick  up\r\n\r\npassengers  without good reason?\" In  fact,  their\r\n\r\nargument  is quite reasonable. However, to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  further  misunderstanding  or\r\n\r\ngroundless blame against the taxi drivers and that\r\n\r\nno unnecessary trouble is caused to members of the\r\n\r\npublic,  why  not  let  the  ROV  stipulate   that\r\n\r\nwhenever  a taxi is unable to pick up a  passenger\r\n\r\nalong   the   way,   a  sign  with   the   wording\r\n\r\n\"Temporarily not for hire\" should be conspicuously\r\n\r\ndisplayed on the taxi. I hope that the authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned will consider my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a Parliament sitting last year, I said that\r\n\r\nsuitable arrangements should be made on that  side\r\n\r\nof  the  road  opposite the special bus  lanes  to\r\n\r\nenable public vehicles which are not permitted  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  bus  lanes  to stop  there  to  pick  up\r\n\r\npassengers or to allow passengers to alight during\r\n\r\nbusy  hours.  But the Minister in charge  did  not\r\n\r\ngive me a direct answer. I would like to point out\r\n\r\nagain that this regulation on bus lanes introduced\r\n\r\nby the Ministry of Communications is causing great\r\n\r\ninconvenience   to  taxi  and  bus   drivers   and\r\n\r\npassengers. In order to avoid in-convenience, many\r\n\r\npassengers  have refused to travel  by  taxis  and\r\n\r\nbuses. Therefore, in order to suit the convenience\r\n\r\nof  the passengers, some drivers have to risk  the\r\n\r\noffence of stopping their vehicles on the side  of\r\n\r\nthe road where a yellow line is drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic fines have increased\r\n\r\nfollowing  inflation. Moreover, implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe   Points  Demerit  System  may  deprive  these\r\n\r\nworkers of their rice bowl at any moment. There-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfore,  I  would  appeal to the Minister  again  to\r\n\r\nreconsider the provision of suitable stops for the\r\n\r\nconvenience of passengers and drivers of taxis and\r\n\r\nbuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the question of buses emitting excessive\r\n\r\nsmoke,  steps  have  been  taken  to  reduce  this\r\n\r\nnuisance and hazard. All buses are now required to\r\n\r\nundergo monthly preventive maintenance at the  bus\r\n\r\ndepots  where special attention is paid to rectify\r\n\r\nthose buses with smoky exhausts. Smoke meters  are\r\n\r\nnow    available   in   all   the   bus    depots.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  it  would take  some  time  before\r\n\r\nsmoky buses are totally eradicated from our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems involved can be fully appreciated if\r\n\r\nits  causes  are fully understood. Smoky  exhausts\r\n\r\ncan  be  caused  by  mechanical failure,  such  as\r\n\r\nfaulty  injectors or fuel pumps. These  mechanical\r\n\r\nfaults  can  be  rectified during  the  preventive\r\n\r\nmaintenance or whenever such cases are brought  to\r\n\r\nthe attention of the company. Unfortunately, there\r\n\r\nare  other  factors  causing  the  buses  to  emit\r\n\r\nexcessive  smoke  and they require  some  time  to\r\n\r\nrectify. Excessive smoke can be emitted when buses\r\n\r\nare  running  with  a  full  passenger  load,  and\r\n\r\nespecially  when  going  up  an  incline,  not  to\r\n\r\nmention when the bus is overloaded. Another  cause\r\n\r\nis  attributable to poor driving habits when gears\r\n\r\nare  not changed in accordance with engine  speed,\r\n\r\nor when excessive fuel is injected by heavy-footed\r\n\r\ndrivers, thus resulting in incomplete combustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding heavily loaded buses emitting excessive\r\n\r\nsmoke, this problem can be stringently dealt  with\r\n\r\nwhen  more  buses are available to meet the  heavy\r\n\r\npeak-hour  demand  for public buses.  As  for  bad\r\n\r\ndriving  habits, this will require a slow  process\r\n\r\nof educating the drivers to change their habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the other point raised by the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Anson  earlier  regarding  irregular\r\n\r\nfrequency,  I  would like to inform him  that  the\r\n\r\nfrequency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  bus  services  is  now  slightly  better  than\r\n\r\npreviously,  although  there  is  still  room  for\r\n\r\nfurther  improvement. There are  now  1,500  buses\r\n\r\noperating  daily compared to 1,400 buses operating\r\n\r\nin  April last year. To further improve frequency,\r\n\r\nthe company has taken the following steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, split shift work was introduced on the\r\n\r\n10th  of this month to put more buses on the  road\r\n\r\nduring peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  expected  that about 60  additional  buses\r\n\r\nwould be put on the road under this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a traffic research unit has been formed\r\n\r\nto  monitor  actual times required to  complete  a\r\n\r\nround-trip at various times of the day.  When  the\r\n\r\nresults are known, existing time schedules will be\r\n\r\nchanged, and the new ones strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, enforcement squads of the company have\r\n\r\nalso stepped up their enforcement measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaint of poor frequency especially\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas, I would like to  inform  the\r\n\r\nMember that the company has placed an order for 81\r\n\r\nshort-wheel-based  buses which would  be  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  use  in these areas where the roads  are  too\r\n\r\nnarrow for the jumbos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step which the company is planning to take\r\n\r\nto improve frequency is to post traffic regulators\r\n\r\nat certain strategic points to regulate the timing\r\n\r\nof  bus  services. The enforcement  officers  will\r\n\r\ntake down the timing and will also he empowered to\r\n\r\nwithhold  buses, if necessary, when they see  more\r\n\r\nthan one bus on the same service route arriving at\r\n\r\nthe  same spot at the same time. They are also  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  interruption  of  bus  services   is\r\n\r\nreduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also complained about oil\r\n\r\nspillage at the bus terminals. It is true that the\r\n\r\nbus  terminals  are  not very  clean  due  to  oil\r\n\r\nsmudges caused by the spillage of diesel fuel  and\r\n\r\ncylinder oil as well as minor repairs carried  out\r\n\r\nat the terminals. Action has already been taken to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that the fuel tanks are fixed with  proper\r\n\r\ncaps  which  are  to be chained  to  the  tank  to\r\n\r\nprevent  loss. For the information of the  Member,\r\n\r\nall  new  buses purchased after January 1974  have\r\n\r\nbeen  fitted with irremovable fuel tank  caps.  As\r\n\r\nfor  the oil spillage due to oil leakage from  the\r\n\r\ngear  boxes  and  rear  axle,  this  can  only  be\r\n\r\neradicated  when the maintenance standard  of  the\r\n\r\nbuses  is  raised  to  a  higher  level  with  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the schedule  preventive  scheme\r\n\r\nexpected  to be introduced sometime in  June  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on the poor condition of\r\n\r\nbuses  on the road. Although the general condition\r\n\r\nof  buses has improved quite considerably,  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettably  true that a few buses which  are  not\r\n\r\nvery  clean or are dirty after a heavy shower  are\r\n\r\nstill seen on the road. But it must be appreciated\r\n\r\nthat a bus, dirtied as a result of a heavy shower,\r\n\r\nneeds time to be cleaned, and other than taking it\r\n\r\noff  the  road,  it  has to  keep  to  its  roster\r\n\r\nschedule.  However, the company  has  ordered  two\r\n\r\nautomatic washing machines, and they are now being\r\n\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on broken windows, torn\r\n\r\nseats  and  leaking  roofs.  These  problems   are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  rectified  sometime  this  year,\r\n\r\npresumably  in  three to four months'  time,  when\r\n\r\nmore buses will be repaired under a special scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  buses could be farmed out for repairs  by\r\n\r\nreliable contractors. Perhaps the Member must have\r\n\r\nread in the newspapers that on average about 3.000\r\n\r\nseats are replaced by the company every month.  In\r\n\r\nthis instance, the bus company has also launched a\r\n\r\nspecial  scheme  known  as  \"Friends  of  SBS\"  to\r\n\r\nencourage  public-spirited commuters to  help  the\r\n\r\ncompany  reduce  damage to  bus  seats  caused  by\r\n\r\nvandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's comment that the spare parts\r\n\r\nare  \"all over the place\", I would like to  inform\r\n\r\nthe Member that 1 visit the bus company regularly,\r\n\r\nand  so  far I have not come across the  situation\r\n\r\nthat  he  has described. If he would let  me  know\r\n\r\nexactly where he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  seen it, I would be very grateful and  I  can\r\n\r\nassure him that I will look into that personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other points raised, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications will answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the spare parts, the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State can see this at Upper  Aljunied\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the House has already\r\n\r\nbeen  fully  informed  about  the  criticisms  and\r\n\r\ncomplaints against the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.\r\n\r\nafter  listening  to two Members  who  are  deeply\r\n\r\ninvolved  with  the affairs of SBS.  Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Boon Teck has admitted that he had been\r\n\r\nkeeping  quiet for the last two years  because  of\r\n\r\nthe overwhelming problems that confronted him.  He\r\n\r\nis  a  member  of  the Bus Services Reorganisation\r\n\r\nCommittee  which was formed in October  1973  just\r\n\r\nwhen   the   Singapore  Bus   Service   Ltd, was\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister of State, has just now\r\n\r\ntried  to  answer the criticisms, and he  is  best\r\n\r\nsuited to do so as he is concurrently the Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Executive Committee of the SBS since August\r\n\r\n1974. The complaints that have been listed out  by\r\n\r\nthe  Members for Sembawang and Anson and of  smoky\r\n\r\nexhaust  by  the  Member for Katong  are  not  new\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  They have been voiced in  this  House\r\n\r\nfor quite some years. Great efforts have been made\r\n\r\nto  improve the situation and, of course, some  of\r\n\r\nthem  are  hardy  enough to persist.  But  we  can\r\n\r\nassure  them and the public that every  effort  is\r\n\r\nbeing made, as far as is humanly possible, to  put\r\n\r\nthings  right. So I do not propose to  go  further\r\n\r\ninto the matter as I shall, before winding up  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on this particular subhead on the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Vehicles, have something more to say, not only\r\n\r\non SBS but of public transport in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now attempt to answer the various matters\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members in this House. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson   complained  about  spilling   by   lorries\r\n\r\ncarrying  earth, sand, etc., which  has  been  the\r\n\r\ncause  of a number of accidents. I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  the matter will be looked into, and it would\r\n\r\nappear  that this comes under the purview  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment. We shall look further\r\n\r\ninto  this  matter  and, if  necessary,  introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation to control this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has something to say about\r\n\r\nthe  work  of our enforcement squad. He mentioned,\r\n\r\nin  particular, heavy goods vehicles from Malaysia\r\n\r\nemitting  smoke and infringing traffic regulations\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. I would like to say two  things.  I\r\n\r\nmyself  have instructed the ROV to look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter  some  months ago, and it is  being  looked\r\n\r\ninto.  But  may I just say that there are  certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties because of the shortage of  staff  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  this  particular department.  He  has\r\n\r\nreceived a written answer (Hansard, Vol. 34, No. 6, cols. 461-2) from my colleague,  the Minister for Home Affairs, which was tabled only a\r\n\r\nfew  days  ago, wherein it was indicated that  the\r\n\r\nROV  enforcement  squad,  which  has  an  approved\r\n\r\nestablishment  of 67, has only 42  personnel.  The\r\n\r\nROV  enforcement squad is actually an offshoot  of\r\n\r\nthe   Traffic  Police  in  the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  So  we  have,  therefore,  only  60%  of\r\n\r\nauthorised   strength.   Despite   this   strained\r\n\r\nstaffing  position, the ROV enforcement squad  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to maintain a reasonably high level  of\r\n\r\nperformance, not just on smoky exhausts but  other\r\n\r\nduties as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period January 1974 to February 1975,\r\n\r\nthe  squad  as a whole submitted no less  than  an\r\n\r\naverage  of 1,600 reports monthly. Over  the  last\r\n\r\ntwo months, January and February of this year, the\r\n\r\nenforcement  squad  made 4,200 and  3,400  reports\r\n\r\nrespectively, which averages about 100 reports per\r\n\r\nman.  In  these circumstances, I hope it  will  be\r\n\r\nappreciated  that  they are stretching  themselves\r\n\r\nfar and wide, and there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  always a limit to what a human being can do  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  him that we will continue to  enforce\r\n\r\nthe  regulations as far as it is humanly  possible\r\n\r\nbefore  getting  a complaint from the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang who says that our enforcement squad is a\r\n\r\nbit  too  strict on taxi drivers. So we can  never\r\n\r\nplease  everybody. If we attempt to  please  A,  B\r\n\r\ncomplains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Please the right people!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Sembawang has this to say about\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers: that in view of the fact that taxis\r\n\r\nhave   got  to  undergo  a  six-month  inspection,\r\n\r\ntherefore  it  would be unnecessary  to  check  on\r\n\r\nsmoky  exhausts. I think the Member is quite aware\r\n\r\nthat  taxis are very heavily used and if they  are\r\n\r\nnot  well  maintained  even  after  the  six-month\r\n\r\ninspection, then probably within a week or a month\r\n\r\nthey are very likely to have smoky exhausts again.\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid that, despite the regular  six-month\r\n\r\ninspection of taxis, if it is reported  that  taxi\r\n\r\nXYZ   is  found  to  be  emitting  visible   smoke\r\n\r\nunreasonably, then  it will  have  to  report  in\r\n\r\nagain,  not immediately but after a bit  of  time.\r\n\r\nAnd  this is where, after getting the summons, the\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver goes to the repair shop, gets it well\r\n\r\ndone  up  and turns up at the ROV. And, of course,\r\n\r\nit  passes the test. So it cannot be said that  it\r\n\r\nis  unreasonable to pull them up. But we are happy\r\r\n\r\nthat the taxi driver, after getting the summons to\r\n\r\nappear  for  an  inspection as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of  a  smoky exhaust, has  put  matters\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the complaint of the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson. He says he has experienced difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngetting  taxis. I can confirm that this  has  been\r\n\r\nthe  position for some time. It is true. I do  not\r\n\r\ndeny  that.  But there may be certain reasons  for\r\n\r\nthe shortage. I think we can do no better than  to\r\n\r\nlook  at this morning's newspaper. The Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  had occasion to censure certain  members\r\n\r\nof  Comfort for failing to let out their taxis  to\r\n\r\nrelief drivers. All taxis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  be  used for two shifts. But  some  Comfort\r\n\r\nmembers  prefer to sit on their back side and  not\r\n\r\nlet   their   taxis   out,  except   for   certain\r\n\r\nundesirable  practices. So there is an  artificial\r\n\r\nshortage  of taxis created by taxi owners  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  have their taxis operating  on  two\r\n\r\nshifts or even three shifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to that, I would say this. We have agreed\r\n\r\nthat the NTUC Comfort should have all new licences\r\n\r\nfor  taxis. But at the moment they are to get only\r\n\r\nan additional 200 taxis on the road. In my view  I\r\n\r\nthink  there should be more taxis. For some reason\r\n\r\nor  other, NTUC prefers not to have too many taxis\r\n\r\noperating because in 1971, after the bus  services\r\n\r\nreorganisation, taxi business was not so  good  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  taxi drivers suffered a drop  in  their\r\n\r\nincome.  So  NTUC  does not want  that  to  happen\r\n\r\nagain.  I would persuade the NTUC to expand  their\r\n\r\nfleet   as   quickly  as  possible,  because   all\r\n\r\navailable  new  licences will  be  given  to  NTUC\r\n\r\nComfort. I think the remedy is in the hands of the\r\n\r\nNTUC Comfort. Of course there are times when there\r\n\r\nis  a  change of shift, from Shift I to Shift  II,\r\n\r\nsometime  between 3.30 p.m, and 5.00  p.m.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  likely that the Member for Thomson hailed  a\r\n\r\ntaxi when it was changing shift, and so the driver\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Sorry, I am on my way home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Point of clarification, Sir. The complaint that\r\n\r\ntaxis fail to stop when hailed does not come  from\r\n\r\nme  alone.  The Members for Paya Lebar and  Jurong\r\n\r\nalso had the same experience. The Minister can ask\r\n\r\nthem. So it is not just something that happened to\r\n\r\nme.  Moreover,  it  is  not  that  such  incidents\r\n\r\nhappened just during shift changing. Sometimes  it\r\n\r\nhappened  at  2.00  p.m, and  sometimes  in   the\r\n\r\nmorning. So those occasions could not occur during\r\n\r\nthe time when the drivers were changing shifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful for the\r\n\r\nclarification. I have agreed that there appears to\r\n\r\nbe  a  shortage of taxis, and I am saying to  NTUC\r\n\r\nComfort, \"Please get on with it.\" I am only trying\r\n\r\nto give certain possible reasons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  if  you hail a taxi, the driver ignores  you,\r\n\r\nand that is because of a change of shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has quite a lot to say\r\n\r\nbecause  he is directly involved in the management\r\n\r\nof  NIUC Comfort. I am pleased to say that he  has\r\n\r\nmade  a  great contribution in the solving of  our\r\n\r\ntransport problem. He has raised the question  why\r\n\r\nthe  Registry of Vehicles continues to allow those\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  in  full-time  employment  as  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers to renew their taxi licences.\r\n\r\nAccording to our records, as at January this  year\r\n\r\nthere were a total of 14,390 licensed taxi drivers\r\n\r\nas  against 5,174 taxis. Based on the ratio  of  2\r\n\r\n1/2  drivers to one taxi, assuming that each  taxi\r\n\r\nwould  be  used  for two shifts - he  himself  has\r\n\r\nadmitted  publicly that not all  taxis  are  being\r\n\r\nused  for  two  shifts - we need only  12,910  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  for  these  5,174  taxis.  There   would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  theoretically a surplus  of  1,480\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers' licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he has a point there when he said that if\r\n\r\na  person who has a full-time employment  holds  a\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver's licence, he is depriving a man  who\r\n\r\nwould like to be a taxi driver by profession.  The\r\n\r\nMember  must  be  aware that since September  last\r\n\r\nyear  the  Registry of Vehicles has  been  holding\r\n\r\nmonthly  meetings, and the people who are  invited\r\n\r\nto   attend   these   monthly   meetings   include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the  Traffic  Police,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Taxi   Transport   Association,    the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Taxi  Drivers'  Association  and   NTUC\r\n\r\nComfort. These meetings have been held to  discuss\r\n\r\nmatters concerning taxi operation, the conduct  of\r\n\r\ndrivers  and  other  related  problems.  I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  ask  the Member if he  could  be  good\r\n\r\nenough  to  raise  these issues at  these  monthly\r\n\r\nmeetings  and  perhaps a happy solution  could  be\r\n\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member next raised the query about not having\r\n\r\ngot  an  answer from me last year on why Scheme  A\r\n\r\nbuses are not given the privilege to use bus lanes\r\n\r\nduring  the  peak hours. I thought the reason  was\r\n\r\ngiven, but may I now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay so in full. Scheme A vehicles consist not only\r\n\r\nof  school buses but also vehicles like mini-buses\r\n\r\nand  lorries,  and  under this  scheme  the  Adult\r\n\r\nWorkers  Contract  Licences  are  issued  to   the\r\n\r\noperators.  Unlike  the SBS and  Scheme  B  buses,\r\n\r\nScheme A buses operate in such a way as to pick up\r\n\r\nand  set  down  passengers at  certain  designated\r\n\r\npoints  and  not  along  public  roads.  Since  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  bus lanes as a new  measure  from\r\n\r\nFebruary  last  year we could not throw  open  the\r\n\r\nreserved  bus lanes for all types of vehicles.  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  SBS buses and Scheme B buses  number\r\n\r\n2,580.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the park and ride scheme comes into operation\r\n\r\nin May, about 88 shuttle buses will also use these\r\n\r\nbus  lanes. I would prefer allowing the  park  and\r\n\r\nride  scheme  and  the  area licensing  scheme  to\r\n\r\noperate  first  before  we review  further  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether Scheme A buses may be permitted to use bus\r\n\r\nlanes. I hope this answer would satisfy the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied - that the matter will be considered\r\n\r\nat the right time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson   who   wishes  to  know   that   with   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the reserved bus lanes  how  many\r\n\r\npeople  have  been called up for contravening  the\r\n\r\nregulations. I have some figures here. Up  to  the\r\n\r\nend of February 1975, that is to say, for the last\r\n\r\n13  months since it came into operation,  no  less\r\n\r\nthan   2,700  persons  were  issued  with  written\r\n\r\nwarnings for unauthorised use of bus lanes  during\r\n\r\nthe  restrictive  hours. We  have  not  taken  any\r\n\r\naction because we felt that we should give it some\r\n\r\ntime  before applying the heavy hand. As everybody\r\n\r\nknows,  since the 1st day of this month the points\r\n\r\ndemerit system has come into operation, and anyone\r\n\r\nwho  enters  the  reserved bus  lanes  during  the\r\n\r\nrestrictive  hours  will be  penalised  with  four\r\n\r\ndemerit   points.  I  think  this  should   be   a\r\n\r\nsufficient  penalty, and if they commit  the  same\r\n\r\noffence  thrice  over they will be  suspended  and\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles might even be expropriated. So  we\r\n\r\nwill allow the points demerit system to operate to\r\n\r\nshow the efficacy of the reserved bus lanes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to the park and ride scheme raised\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Anson. He has misgivings  about\r\n\r\nthis  scheme. 1 have already indicated in my reply\r\n\r\nto  the  hon. Member for Toa Payoh that we believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  implementation of  the  park  and  ride\r\n\r\nscheme  and the area licensing scheme will have  a\r\n\r\nsignificant effect in reducing traffic  congestion\r\n\r\non our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, it may be recalled that at\r\n\r\nthis  time  last year, during the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nestimates  for  the Registry of Vehicles  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  l974-75,  I  had  indicated,  as\r\n\r\nreported in Hansard, of 20th March, 1974 [Vol. 33,\r\n\r\ncol. 466] as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Measures have been and will continue to be taken\r\n\r\nto   provide  an  adequate  public  bus   service,\r\n\r\nsupplemented  where necessary with other  feasible\r\n\r\nforms  of  public or group transport.  However,  a\r\n\r\npublic transport system cannot operate efficiently\r\n\r\nif  it is not protected from the congestion caused\r\n\r\nby  private cars in central areas, on high-density\r\n\r\nroutes  and  in peak-hour traffic. If the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  cannot  be  eased  through   voluntary\r\n\r\nmeans,  such  as  staggered  work-hours  and   the\r\n\r\nformation  of car pools, then physical constraints\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be introduced to obtain a mandatory\r\n\r\nchange. The introduction of reserved bus lanes  is\r\n\r\none step in this direction.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I said, at col. 467:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has already been announced that a study is\r\n\r\nunderway  to  consider  a  park-and-ride   scheme,\r\n\r\nwhereby commuters could park their cars in  fringe\r\n\r\ncar  parks and take a shuttle bus into or  out  of\r\n\r\nthe Central Business District during peak periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, measures to curb the rise in private\r\n\r\ncar ownership are also under study.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the position today?\r\n\r\nFirstly,  as  regards SBS, we have  already  moved\r\n\r\ninto SBS - a Government Team of Officials which at\r\n\r\none  stage  comprised as many as 140 officers  but\r\n\r\nnow reduced to 10() - to reorganise and strengthen\r\n\r\nits  management since the end of July 1974. At the\r\n\r\ntime  of the secondment of the Government Team  of\r\n\r\nOfficials, it was indicated that it might take two\r\n\r\nto   three  years  to  achieve  the  objective  of\r\n\r\nproviding   a  clean  and  efficient  public   bus\r\n\r\nservice.  Although the services of SBS  have  been\r\n\r\nimproved, however, much remains to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Government Team of Officials has been in\r\n\r\nSBS  for seven months, the problems to be overcome\r\n\r\nare   indeed  greater  than  at  first  envisaged.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it has been stated in the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress, [Hansard of 21st February, 1975, col. 6],\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The bus service is improving. More improvement\r\n\r\ncan be made in another three to five years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  intention is clear - our Government,  through\r\n\r\nour  Team  of  Officials in SBS, is determined  to\r\n\r\nraise  the standard and the quality of  SBS  as  a\r\n\r\npublic  bus service befitting a modern  city  like\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our drive to reduce traffic congestion we have,\r\n\r\nsince July last year, started a six-month national\r\n\r\ncampaign   to  encourage  more  people  to   adopt\r\n\r\nstaggered   work  hours  and  to   encourage   the\r\n\r\nformation  of  more  car  pools.  Thanks  to   the\r\n\r\ncooperation  from  all  sides,  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nreasonable success in both respects today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of staggered work hours, over 120.000\r\n\r\nworkers  are  now adopting staggered  work  hours,\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  60,000  workers  employed  in  1,138\r\n\r\nestablishments in the private sector and a similar\r\n\r\nnumber of workers in the public sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for car pools we have established a Car Pool\r\n\r\nManagement  Unit in the Registry  of  Vehicles  at\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road  in January this year  to  match  car\r\n\r\npools  through  the computer. To-date,  more  than\r\n\r\n5.400 registration forms have been distributed and\r\n\r\n316  car  pools  have been formed,  involving  229\r\n\r\nadults  and  768 school children. In addition,  84\r\n\r\nprivately-formed car pools involving  417  persons\r\n\r\nhave  been registered with our Car Pool Management\r\n\r\nUnit.  Soon,  100,000  car  owners  who  will   be\r\n\r\nreceiving their notices for renewal of road tax by\r\n\r\npost   will   be  receiving  car  pools  publicity\r\n\r\nbrochures as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now on the threshold of implementing two\r\n\r\ntraffic management measures to drastically  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  present traffic congestion, namely, the  park\r\n\r\nand ride shuttle bus scheme which is scheduled  to\r\n\r\ncome into operation in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay,  that is l 1/2 months from now, and the  area\r\n\r\nlicensing  scheme which will come  into  effect  a\r\n\r\nmonth later in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can now be disclosed that the World Bank has\r\n\r\nindicated great interest in our traffic management\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  are  already  in  the  midst  of  a\r\n\r\nresearch  study  to assess the  effects  of  these\r\n\r\ntraffic management measures. The interest shown is\r\n\r\nbecause we are probably the only city in the world\r\n\r\nto have so many traffic management measures to try\r\n\r\nto  control traffic congestion and to improve  the\r\n\r\npublic bus transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The World Bank research studies have already\r\n\r\nconducted  interviews with  a  number  of  non-car\r\n\r\nowning households which were completed in November\r\n\r\nlast   year,   and  interviews  with  car   owning\r\n\r\nhouseholds are now in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what has been the effect of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to discourage the rapid growth\r\n\r\nof  car  ownership, ever since the Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAction Committee was established in October  1973?\r\n\r\nThe  figures of the number of new cars  registered\r\n\r\nfor  the three-month period, December to February,\r\n\r\nfor  the  three  years  are most  revealing.  From\r\n\r\nDecember 1972 to February 1973, the number of  new\r\n\r\ncars  registered  was 5.068. The  year  following.\r\n\r\nDecember  1973  to February 1974, the  number  was\r\n\r\n4,277,  a  drop  of  16%. From  December  1974  to\r\n\r\nFebruary  1975, the latest figures, the number  of\r\n\r\nnew  cars registered was 1,978, a drop of 54%.

It\r\n\r\nseems  to be a fantastic amount of money  just  to\r\n\r\nmake  a study of the system, when nothing has been\r\n\r\nimplemented as far as the system is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be much better if we do not make a\r\n\r\nstudy  of  the system - in fact, Phase II  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  Our main aim is to reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\nvehicles on the road at any cost. The Mass Transit\r\n\r\nSystem  will not serve much purpose. Once our  bus\r\n\r\ntransport  system is greatly improved, we  do  not\r\n\r\nrequire a Mass Transit System. Our island  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall  and,  therefore, this system  will  not  be\r\n\r\nfeasible,  perhaps  even worse,  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nprofitable. Therefore, I see no necessity for this\r\n\r\namount  of  money to be spent on the system,  even\r\n\r\nwith  the help of the United Nations. This  amount\r\n\r\nof  money can be used in a more worthwhile  manner\r\n\r\nif it is redirected to a more productive use where\r\n\r\nthe   citizens  can  benefit  directly.

While  I  am  not\r\n\r\ntrying  to say that I do not share his confidence,\r\n\r\nI  think the problems in three years' time will be\r\n\r\ngreater  than the problems today, as  far  as  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for public transport is concerned.  It  is\r\n\r\nlike  the  dog chasing its own tail.  True,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  improvements in the SBS operations.  But\r\n\r\nwill  the  improvements be effective or sufficient\r\n\r\nenough  to  cope with the increased problems  that\r\n\r\nare  going  to  be faced because  of  the  heavier\r\n\r\ndemand  for  public transport? As I said  earlier,\r\n\r\nwith  the  squeeze  now  being  tightened  on  car\r\n\r\nowners,  we  can expect more and more  car  owners\r\n\r\ncommuting  by  public transport. On top  of  that,\r\n\r\nevery year thousands of school-leavers are joining\r\n\r\nthe  ranks of office-workers. They will also  help\r\n\r\nto  increase the demand on public transport.  That\r\n\r\nbeing the position, I am just wondering whether we\r\n\r\ncould  not quicken the pace to get the Mass  Rapid\r\n\r\nTransit  System introduced, if not by this  decade\r\n\r\nthen, at least, in the early 1980s and not in  the\r\n\r\nlate 1980s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to inform this\r\n\r\nHouse  of the latest position regarding the second\r\n\r\nphase of the Feasibility Study on the MRT. I  hope\r\n\r\nto  hear  of  a very good progress report  -  that\r\n\r\neverything is going fine, and that we will be able\r\n\r\nto  meet the target date much earlier. I hope that\r\n\r\nwill  be  the kind of answer he gives. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is always confident. This is one big\r\n\r\nchallenge  ahead  of  him,  and  with  his   usual\r\n\r\nconfidence, perhaps he will make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, earlier\r\n\r\non  the  Member for Sembawang did raise the matter\r\n\r\nof  the  Mass  Transit Study and I have  indicated\r\n\r\nthat this is probably the right time to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Reply to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In passing.

Paper No. 3 of 1974)  was\r\n\r\ntabled  covering  the findings and recommendations\r\n\r\nof  Phase I of the Mass Transit Study. I am  happy\r\n\r\nto report that the initial work on Phase II of the\r\n\r\nStudy,   which  will  incorporate  more   detailed\r\n\r\neconomic   and   financial   evaluation   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommended system, is underway. Like the  earlier\r\n\r\nphase,  Phase II of the Study will be carried  out\r\n\r\nby  a team of consultants, supported by Government\r\n\r\ncounterpart staff appointed by the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe World Bank. It is expected that this phase  of\r\n\r\nthe  Study  will be completed by the end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Mass Transit System of the type and scale\r\n\r\nbeing  contemplated, the full impact of the system\r\n\r\nmust   be   studied  in  order  to  evaluate   the\r\n\r\nfeasibility   of   the   scheme.   Such    initial\r\n\r\nfeasibility studies usually cost about 1%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost.  Assuming a conservative estimate  of\r\n\r\n$1,000  million,  or  the  American  term  of   $1\r\n\r\nbillion,  for  the  system,  the  cost   for   the\r\n\r\nfeasibility  studies would be around $10  million.\r\n\r\nBut  the  total  cost of Phases I and  II  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Mass Transit Study is estimated at  only\r\n\r\n$4  1/2  million, which is less than 1/2%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal cost, of which our Government's contribution\r\n\r\nis  about  $2.1  million, the rest being  provided\r\n\r\nunder  the  United Nations Development  Programme.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson said that  it  would  be  a\r\n\r\nfantastic sum to spend. I would say this  to  him.\r\n\r\nIt  would be penny wise pound foolish not to incur\r\n\r\nthe   expense   of  a  Feasibility  Study   before\r\n\r\nembarking on a $1,000 million project. No  prudent\r\n\r\nGovernment   would  choose  to   avoid   such   an\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   The  Mass  Rapid   Transit   System\r\n\r\nproposed  is  intended to be a long-term  solution\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's  public transport  needs.  Travel\r\n\r\nanalyses  carried out have indicated  that  within\r\n\r\nthe next 15 years public transport demand would be\r\n\r\ndoubled what it is today. This is the result of  a\r\n\r\ncombination of factors of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowing population, rising affluence, increasing\r\n\r\nemployment and social opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the present Government policy of\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  car  ownership and  its  usage,  the\r\n\r\neffect  could only result in Singaporeans  relying\r\n\r\neven  more  on public transport. From observations\r\n\r\nof   bus   operations,  it  is  clear   that   the\r\n\r\nalternative of public transport, based  solely  on\r\n\r\nbuses   operating  on  surface  streets  in  mixed\r\n\r\ntraffic, will deteriorate and cannot be a workable\r\n\r\nsolution  to cater for the much greater  transport\r\n\r\ndemand  in  the future. A mass transit  system  is\r\n\r\ntherefore   ore   recommended   to   support   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment envisaged for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct to say that the mass transit\r\n\r\nsystem will benefit mostly the motorists. The bulk\r\n\r\nof  its users, if built, is expected to come  from\r\n\r\nthe  non-vehicle owning trip-makers  who  have  no\r\n\r\nalternative  but to rely on public transport,  and\r\n\r\nto  that  extent motorists will also use the  mass\r\n\r\ntransit  system. The number of car trips  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced,  and hence free road facilities for  more\r\n\r\nessential  traffic.  During  the  interim  period,\r\n\r\nuntil  we do have a mass transit system, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have to rely on the present system of public\r\n\r\ntransport based on buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Why cannot  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  supply  more bins and  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nrubbish is collected more often?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also quite a number of other bin\r\n\r\ncentres  where  rubbish  has  not  been  collected\r\n\r\nregularly  and  the bins are left unattended.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  will  say that there is  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  and  vehicles.

Can the Minister\r\n\r\ndo  something to make sure that rubbish  is  being\r\n\r\ncollected  regularly? Furthermore, in some  places\r\n\r\nwhen  the  daily  rubbish is being trucked  along,\r\n\r\ndirty  water and rubbish spill all over the  road.\r\n\r\nThis  leaves  an  awful stench  all  the  way  and\r\n\r\npassers-by have to bear with this \"aroma\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the present\r\n\r\nnumber of incinerators are adequate to burn up all\r\n\r\nthe   increased   volume  of  rubbish.

I find a good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people still smoke in buses.

One  is the selection, of  sites  for\r\n\r\nhawker centres and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  stalls. We know  that  the  basic\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government in respect of hawkers  is\r\n\r\nto  build  hawker centres to accommodate  licensed\r\n\r\nroadside hawkers. This i5 not a bad policy at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still something wanting in the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  site and the number of  stalls  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided   in  the  hawker  centres.  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament have no say at all in this matter, even\r\n\r\nif  they  have  such  problems arising  in  theirs\r\n\r\nContituencies.  I  feel  that  since  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  are in a better position to understand\r\n\r\ntheir own constituents, they should be invited  to\r\n\r\nair  their  views in the matter of the  number  of\r\n\r\nhawker stalls and the site for hawker centres.  If\r\n\r\nMPs  arc not allowed any say at all, then at least\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  consulted SO  as  to  avoid  the\r\n\r\nselection  of  a wrong or unsuitable  site  for  a\r\n\r\nhawker   centre.  An  erroneous  decision  usually\r\n\r\nresults  in  a lot of complaints being brought  to\r\n\r\nthe attention of the MPs concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is about\r\n\r\nhawker  inspectors and environmental public health\r\n\r\ninspectors. Some Members have in the past few days\r\n\r\nmade  complaints about discourtesy on the part  of\r\n\r\ncivil servants towards members of the public. Here\r\n\r\nI would like to give a few instances to illustrate\r\n\r\nthe  discourtesy and harassment  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\npublic  health  inspectors and hawker  inspectors.\r\n\r\nThese public servants feel that because they  have\r\n\r\nthe  power  to issue summonses, they  continue  to\r\n\r\nissue  summonses until the shopkeepers and hawkers\r\n\r\nsuccumb. Most shopkeepers and hawkers are very law-abiding citizens. They are conscious of the health\r\n\r\nregulations, but during peak hours of business the\r\n\r\nplace is dirtied by the customers. So during  peak\r\n\r\nhours  they do not have the time to clean  up  the\r\n\r\nplace and thus open themselves to summonses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I received many complaints of this\r\n\r\nnature.   These   hawkers  complained   that   the\r\n\r\ninspectors are fussy and unreasonable or even  try\r\n\r\nto  be  difficult  with the  people  concerned  by\r\n\r\nissuing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummonses  indiscriminately. I think the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me that in places  like  coffee\r\n\r\nshops and markets, it is quite impossible to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  whole  place  spick and span  at  all  times.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  public  health inspectors  and  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors should be sympathetic, considerate  and\r\n\r\nreasonable.  If  at the end of the day's  business\r\n\r\nthe  place is not cleaned, then perhaps the hawker\r\n\r\nand  health inspectors may be justified in issuing\r\n\r\nsummonses. Nothing can then be said against  them.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope  the Minister can instruct the  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors  and health inspectors, who come  under\r\n\r\nhis  control, not to behave like overlords  ruling\r\n\r\nover  the heads of the hawkers and members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  They  should  be  reasonable  in  issuing\r\n\r\nsummonses.  Otherwise,  they  will  only  increase\r\n\r\ntheir occupational hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, the Member for Anson is repeating what he\r\n\r\nsaid  in  previous  Budget  sessions,  i.e, the\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  collection  of  rubbish.  I  have\r\n\r\nreplied  to him in detail during the last  Budget\r\n\r\nsession, and therefore I am not going to take too\r\n\r\nmuch  time of the House by going over the grounds\r\n\r\nagain.  But let me remind the House that  rubbish\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is collected regularly and at least\r\n\r\nonce a day. This is one of the few big cities  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  where rubbish is collected daily.  On\r\n\r\nthe  average the Ministry collects 1,200 tons  of\r\n\r\nrefuse daily and our trucks cover 260 routes each\r\n\r\nand make 400 trips per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of refuse bins, it is not whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  enough or not enough  bins.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion of whether members of the public do  make\r\n\r\ncorrect  use of the facilities at bin centres.  On\r\n\r\noccasions  members  of  the  public  throw  refuse\r\n\r\naround  bin centres instead of putting the  refuse\r\n\r\ninto  the  bins. This, of course, would  give  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson the impression that rubbish  has\r\n\r\nbeen left behind. There are occasions when rubbish\r\n\r\nis  piled  up at bin centres. These occasions  are\r\n\r\nfew  and  when  they  arise,  it  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  the  collecting  truck.  But,  once\r\n\r\ninformation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  received  by the Ministry that a refuse  truck\r\n\r\nhas broken down, another truck will be sent to  do\r\n\r\nthe collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of bad smell coming from\r\n\r\ntrucks carrying refuse and of spillage, I can  say\r\n\r\nthat  situation is gradually improving. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson probably had the unfortunate experience\r\n\r\nof  driving behind a very old truck that sprang  a\r\n\r\nleak.  We are replacing all these old trucks  with\r\n\r\nleak-proof trucks so that, in future, if he should\r\n\r\nbe  driving behind one of these trucks he will not\r\n\r\nbe able to smell any, thing at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is incinerators. We dispose of\r\n\r\nour refuse largely by dumping them in -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Changi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No. In Tampines Road. We tip this refuse largely\r\n\r\nover  dumping  grounds outside the  city.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment they are adequate enough to take 1,200 tons\r\n\r\nof refuse daily. For the information of the House,\r\n\r\nI  would just like to say that we are planning  to\r\n\r\nbuild  an  incinerator of 1,200 tons capacity  per\r\n\r\nday, and it is expected to be operational by 1978.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not able to give the Member for Anson facts\r\n\r\nand figures on people who have been caught smoking\r\n\r\nin  buses.  If he wants such detailed information,\r\n\r\nhe can send in a question for oral answer. What  I\r\n\r\nknow  is that enforcement action is taken  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  sign \"No Smoking\" in buses is  strictly\r\n\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Jurong, he complained\r\n\r\nthat  the inspectors are very hard on the  hawkers\r\n\r\nand  are  issuing  summonses  indiscriminately.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  accept that. There are certain  procedures\r\n\r\nto  be  followed, and our inspectors are  told  to\r\n\r\nadhere  strictly to them before they  issue  their\r\n\r\nsummonses. Usually a summons is issued only  after\r\n\r\na    warning   has   been   given.   Knowing   how\r\n\r\nirresponsible  some hawkers can be, the  situation\r\n\r\nwould certainly deteriorate if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  lax  in enforcing the rule of cleanliness\r\n\r\namong  our  hawkers. As it were, we  have  already\r\n\r\nachieved a certain standard of cleanliness  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  hate to see it deteriorate. Once  it  does,\r\n\r\nthen we will have a tough time restoring it to our\r\n\r\npresent high standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we do train our\r\n\r\nhealth  inspectors to be polite,  but  firm,  with\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  public.  If  Members   receive\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from hawkers that the inspectors  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  have been very rigid  and  rude,  I\r\n\r\nwould ask them to listen to the other side of  the\r\n\r\nstory.  In instances where complaints of  rudeness\r\n\r\nhave  been brought to my attention, I always  make\r\n\r\nit  a point to carry out a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\nYou will find that there are always two sides to a\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I dislike is the implied threat in the\r\n\r\nMember's statement with regard to the behaviour of\r\n\r\nhealth inspectors. If I am not mistaken, he  wants\r\n\r\nthe  health inspector to be more polite, otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  consequences would be disastrous. Let me warn\r\n\r\nthose  who attempt to take the law into their  own\r\n\r\nhands   and  hurt  health  inspectors  or   public\r\n\r\nservants in the course of their duty. They will be\r\n\r\nseverely  dealt with when caught and  we  will  do\r\n\r\neverything  possible to see that they are  caught.\r\n\r\nAfter all the inspectors are doing their duty, and\r\n\r\nit  has been impressed upon them that they must be\r\n\r\npolite but firm. It is only this firmness that can\r\n\r\nbring about the desired results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of consulting Members\r\n\r\nin  the  design of hawker centres, the  Department\r\n\r\ndoes  from time to time seek the views of Members.\r\n\r\nBut  I think Members will agree with me that  when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to detailed planning the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment who are professionals are in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to know the requirements. Of course,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  very fortunate to be able to  find  the\r\n\r\nmost suitable place for a hawker centre and to  be\r\n\r\nable  to provide more than enough stall-space  for\r\n\r\nhawkers in the vicinity,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  the  ideal is not always possible. There  are\r\n\r\nfinancial  limitations and space limitations,  but\r\n\r\nwherever possible we will consult hon. Members.  I\r\n\r\nmust  stress  here again that the  final  decision\r\n\r\nrests  with  my Ministry because in  building  any\r\n\r\nstructure not only one department is concerned but\r\n\r\nmany  others. It is only the professionals at  the\r\n\r\njob  who will be able to give advice which is  not\r\n\r\nonly  suitable  but  also  in  keeping  with   the\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to clarify. What I am saying is\r\n\r\nthat Members of Parliament should be consulted  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the site of the hawker centre  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of stalls. If Members' views are sought,  I\r\n\r\nwould be very grateful. We do not want a situation\r\n\r\nin  which Members of Parliament actually supervise\r\n\r\nthe  construction of the site. That is not what  I\r\n\r\nam asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of hawker inspectors,\r\n\r\nalthough the Minister has said that they have been\r\n\r\ninstructed  to  be  polite in the  performance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  duties,  very often they forget  about  the\r\n\r\nneed  to be polite. So they become very harsh with\r\n\r\nthe hawkers. For example, during the peak hours of\r\n\r\nbusiness in a market, a vegetable hawker may  have\r\n\r\ndropped  one leaf of vegetable on the  ground  and\r\n\r\nthe  hawker inspector comes round and say,  \"There\r\n\r\nyou  are. Pick it up, otherwise I will give you  a\r\n\r\nsummons.\"  Again, some inspectors  may  require  a\r\n\r\nstallholder in a coffee shop to sweep the place at\r\n\r\na time when there are so many customers around, or\r\n\r\nduring   the   peak   hours.   This   action    is\r\n\r\nunreasonable. Sir, you may be aware of the  belief\r\n\r\nthat  if you sweep the floor when there are a  lot\r\n\r\nof  patrons  in  the coffee shop,  you  will  lose\r\n\r\nbusiness. Under the circumstances there should  be\r\n\r\nsome  flexibility and understanding. If the hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors and health inspectors are polite,  they\r\n\r\ncan  expect politeness in return. Courtesy  begets\r\n\r\ncourtesy,  and  there will be no  unhappiness  and\r\n\r\nunfortunate cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The people should be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nadopt   cremation  as  a  funeral  rite,   because\r\n\r\ncremation being economical both in cost and  space\r\n\r\nand cleaner merits active encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether our Minister, who is well\r\n\r\nknown for campaigns, will be prepared to launch  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide campaign to encourage the adoption  of\r\n\r\ncremation  as the standard funeral rite.  In  line\r\n\r\nwith  this  campaign  we should  also  build  more\r\n\r\ncrematoria   and  columbaria,  which   should   be\r\n\r\ndistributed  evenly instead of concentrating  them\r\n\r\nin  a  certain  area.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment should not only build funeral  parlours\r\n\r\nbut  also allow private enterprises to build  more\r\n\r\nfuneral  parlours.

These   are  some   of   the   courses:\r\n\r\nOrientation  Course  for Assistant  Public  Health\r\n\r\nInspectors,   Water  Pollution  Control   Courses,\r\n\r\nRefresher    Courses   in   Public   Health    Law\r\n\r\nEnforcement,  Technicians  Sanitary   Course   for\r\n\r\ntechnical staff of the Sewerage Department, Sewage\r\n\r\nTreatment Works Operators Course for the technical\r\n\r\nstaff  attached to the Sewage Treatment Works  and\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Waterworks,   Intensive   Course   on\r\n\r\nSewerage  and Sanitation for technicians preparing\r\n\r\nfor Departmental examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the Royal Society of Health\r\n\r\ncourses for Public Health Inspectors.

In\r\n\r\n1973, 28 Public Health Inspectors underwent this\r\n\r\ncourse, and 34 in 1974. This year 39 students are\r\n\r\nattending this course.

All\r\n\r\nin all, for 1974 we have a total of more than 200\r\n\r\nstudents undergoing the various courses in the\r\n\r\nMinistry. Students from other statutory boards or\r\n\r\ngovernment departments also enrol in the courses\r\n\r\nappropriate to their duties.

This is an undeniable fact. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe should praise his Ministry for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  work.  When  praise is  due  we  should  give\r\n\r\npraise,  and similarly when criticism is  deserved\r\n\r\nwe should duly criticise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been complaints against\r\n\r\nhawker   inspectors   about  their   conflict   or\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  with  hawkers.  Just   now   the\r\n\r\nMinister said that the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nis  conducting  educational courses,  including  a\r\n\r\ncourse  on human relations. This is very  good.  I\r\n\r\nhope  there  is no training course on Tae-kwon-Do,\r\n\r\nbecause   that   is  not  proper.   These   hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors  can  work  very  well  but  they  lack\r\n\r\nexperience.  They lack tolerance as well  as  good\r\n\r\nand  patient  manners needed to  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nwork.  Sometimes  in  dealing  with  hawkers  they\r\n\r\nbehave  like detectives trying to catch criminals.\r\n\r\nI  have  personally  seen this behaviour  on  many\r\n\r\noccasions.  What  I would like to  raise  here  is\r\n\r\nabout  the  licensed hawkers who sometimes  commit\r\n\r\ncertain  minor  offences.  I  would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the  hawker inspectors are  empowered  to\r\n\r\nconfiscate  their  goods, when they  can  get  the\r\n\r\ncourt to issue summons to the offending hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such incident occurred to a fish hawker in my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Having tendered for  some  fish  at\r\n\r\nabout  7.00 a.m, or 8.00 am, at the Jurong Central\r\n\r\nFish  Market one day, he returned to  put  up  his\r\n\r\nstall.  In doing so he had to put the fish on  the\r\n\r\nfive-foot  way. Unaware to him, a hawker inspector\r\n\r\ncame  up  and said that his fish were  causing  an\r\n\r\nobstruction  to  the  pedestrian  walk.  He   then\r\n\r\nconfiscated  all his fish. Thus, his  capital  was\r\n\r\ngone. This kind of incident is not really serious.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a minor incident and we should give humane\r\n\r\nconsideration to such minor cases, otherwise  they\r\n\r\nmight   damage   the   good  reputation   of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  would  urge the  Minister  to  pay\r\n\r\nparticular attention to such incidents in order to\r\n\r\nprevent them from happening again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, undoubtedly the Government has taken an\r\n\r\nactive  part in improving the welfare of  hawkers.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, in recent years the Government  has\r\n\r\nbuilt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  number  of hawker centres which provide  modern\r\n\r\nhealthy  amenities  for them to  carry  out  their\r\n\r\ntrade.    In    previous   years   a   nation-wide\r\n\r\nregistration  of all hawkers was carried  out  and\r\n\r\ntemporary licences were issued so that they  could\r\n\r\nhave fixed sites to carry on their trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Hawkers Department has improved the\r\n\r\nwelfare   of   licensed  hawkers,  the  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers   how, ever  are  still   facing   great\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Those who engage in  hawking  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans  of  livelihood are mainly  elderly  people.\r\n\r\nSome  of them set up their stalls by the road side\r\n\r\nselling  cigarettes, newspapers  or  magazines  in\r\n\r\norder to earn a little to help maintain the meagre\r\n\r\nlivelihood of their household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hawker who was selling putu mayam,\r\n\r\nwhich is an Indian variety of bee hoon. This  putu\r\n\r\nmayam  is  very  popular among the  poorer  people\r\n\r\nbecause it is very cheap. These putu mayam hawkers\r\n\r\nusually carry baskets of putu mayam on their heads\r\n\r\nwhen  they hawk. Newspaper vendors, however,  sell\r\n\r\nnewspapers  by  going  from  house  to  house   on\r\n\r\nbicycles.  These  hawkers are not registered  with\r\n\r\nthe  Hawkers  Department  and  are  therefore  not\r\n\r\nissued with any licences at all. This makes  their\r\n\r\ntrade illegal. When spotted by a hawker inspector,\r\n\r\nthey  will be issued with a summons. But  if  they\r\n\r\nwere  to stop their trade, they will have no means\r\n\r\nto  earn  a livelihood. Sometimes they are  served\r\n\r\nwith  about  five, six or even 10 summonses  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth. In my constituency a few such hawkers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  served with just such a number of  summonses\r\n\r\nper  month. Some hawker inspectors even confiscate\r\n\r\ntheir   goods.  As  the  Member  for  Bras   Basah\r\n\r\nmentioned just now, they take away the putu  mayam\r\n\r\nor  the  newspapers, thus causing a great loss  to\r\n\r\nthe hawkers concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these hawkers are our citizens. If we do not\r\n\r\ngive them a means to earn a living, they will have\r\n\r\nto go to the Social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department and the Government  will  thus\r\n\r\nhave  the  additional financial burden of  looking\r\n\r\nafter  them.  So  I would like the  Government  to\r\n\r\ngrant them a means of livelihood and so give  them\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to earn a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to irritate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  but I want something  to  be  done\r\n\r\nabout  the  hawkers in my constituency. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  tune  of my plea will be very soft.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to touch on the problems of the hawkers in my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  and  I hope the  Minister  for  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment will give sympathetic consideration to\r\n\r\nmy  plea for those hawkers who are either licensed\r\n\r\nor are temporarily licensed to hawk. These hawkers\r\n\r\nwere  formerly living at Changi Point.  They  were\r\n\r\naffected  by resettlement and, as a result,  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood   has  been  severely  affected.   Sir,\r\n\r\nanother  problem is this. The fishermen at  Lorong\r\n\r\nDangai   in   Changi   were   also   affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement and have been accommodated in Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats. Having been resettled far away  from\r\n\r\nthe sea, they have therefore completely lost their\r\n\r\nonly  means of living, i.e, fishing. These  people\r\n\r\nhave  made  an  appeal  for allocation  of  hawker\r\n\r\nstalls in the Bedok New Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another appeal from the hawkers who are\r\n\r\nlicensed to hawk at Changi Road and Bedok Road  is\r\n\r\nthat  they be given permission to sell their goods\r\n\r\nat  Koh  Sek Lim Road between 7.00 a.m, and  8.00\r\n\r\na.m.,  before proceeding to the place  which  they\r\n\r\nare licensed to sell. Sir, I must stress that this\r\n\r\npractice  has been going on for a long  time.  The\r\n\r\nformer hawker inspector who was in charge of  that\r\n\r\nplace knew the situation of these hawkers. But the\r\n\r\nmoment  a new hawker inspector is posted  to  that\r\n\r\nplace, he does not know about the situation. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  these poor hawkers have been  warned,  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister has said, and then summoned. With the\r\n\r\nresettlement   and   redevelopment    of    Changi\r\n\r\nconstituency  and  all its attendant  problems.  I\r\n\r\nhope  inconvenience to these people can be reduced\r\n\r\nto  the  minimum.  I  would,  therefore,  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  points sympathetically so as to make  these\r\n\r\npeople a little bit happier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues, the\r\n\r\nMembers   for  Jurong,  Bras  Basah   and   Changi\r\n\r\nregarding  the  hawker  inspectors.   I   am   not\r\n\r\ncriticising  them as such because they  are  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  duty.  But  they are doing  their  job  too\r\n\r\nseriously,  and  do not give any  warning  to  the\r\n\r\nhawkers. These hawkers have already been licensed,\r\n\r\nand  so  we  must  consider their  position.  They\r\n\r\nalways  try to clean the place. But when  do  they\r\n\r\nclean  it?  It is only after they have closed  the\r\n\r\nshop,  will they clean the place. And if the place\r\n\r\nis   found  dirty,  then  action  can  be   taken.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  it  is  very bad  to  make  the  people\r\n\r\nsuffer. It is no good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the general policy of the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  resite all hawkers in  the  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres. By now, a considerable number of  hawkers\r\n\r\nhave  been  resited.  The Hawkers  Department  has\r\n\r\nindeed  done  an excellent job. But then,  sad  to\r\n\r\nsay,  there  are still a great number  of  hawkers\r\n\r\nhawking  in the back lanes and shoddy areas.  When\r\n\r\nwill  these  hawkers  be  resited  in  the  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres?  May  I  know  also whether  the  hawkers\r\n\r\naround  the Shenton Way bus terminus and the  back\r\n\r\nlane of Choon Guan Street would be resited in  the\r\n\r\nhawker centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that when an exercise is carried out\r\n\r\nto  resite these hawkers, the hawker centre should\r\n\r\nbe  sited in my constituency because these hawkers\r\n\r\nhave been doing business there and they prefer  to\r\n\r\nbe resited in the same locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how often are hawkers required to be\r\n\r\nmedically  examined? Very often  the  cholera  and\r\n\r\ntyphoid  epidemics are spread by  hawkers.  It  is\r\n\r\nhigh time for all hawkers to be medically examined\r\n\r\nwithout  any charge, so that they can be certified\r\n\r\nfit before they are permitted to sell food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the recent outbreak of typhoid fever has\r\n\r\nprompted  me  to  raise several  questions  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  present measures are adequate to  control\r\n\r\nthe  spread of such diseases \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough the  handling of food by hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have a large number of hawker centres\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  clean and healthy environment  for\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers,  the licensing of these  hawkers  is\r\n\r\nconfined   only   to  those  hawkers   under   the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the Hawkers Department. The  hawkers\r\n\r\nunder   the   management  of   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board need not obtain  licences  from\r\n\r\nthe   Hawkers  Department.  However,  the  tenancy\r\n\r\nagreement  between  the  Housing  Board  and   the\r\n\r\nhawkers  contains  pro, visions  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nregulations of the Hawkers Department. The point I\r\n\r\nwish  to make, Sir, is: why cannot all hawkers  be\r\n\r\nlicensed under one single authority so that  there\r\n\r\nwill be better and more effective control?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, there are some loopholes ii, the\r\n\r\nregulations  on  the control of  hygiene  in  food\r\n\r\npreparation. For hawkers who are already sited  in\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board hawker centres, the problem  is\r\n\r\nnot so great as most of them are living in Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats  where  the surroundings  are  clean.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  they  have modem sanitation.  But  what\r\n\r\nabout  those  hawkers sited in the hawker  centres\r\n\r\nmanaged  by the Hawkers Department? These  hawkers\r\n\r\nprepare  the  food in their own homes,  which  are\r\n\r\nusually  in the rural or squatter areas. I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  there is any control over the preparation\r\n\r\nof  food by these hawkers, and whether inspections\r\n\r\nare  made  of the place where the cooked  food  is\r\n\r\nprepared  so  as  to protect the public  from  the\r\n\r\nhazards of such diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for cleanliness, I notice that quite a number\r\n\r\nof  itinerant hawkers who sell roast pork  (it  is\r\n\r\nsio  bak, as spoken in Hokkien, and not char  siu,\r\n\r\nas  spoken in Cantonese) convey their food  openly\r\n\r\non  vehicles through the streets which  often  are\r\n\r\nvery dusty, especially when a road excavation work\r\n\r\nis  going  on.  I would suggest that  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  impose  regulations  requiring   these\r\n\r\nhawkers to cover their food when they hawk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, presumably the Member for Toa Payoh thinks\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  health  inspectors of  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment are not strict enough in enforcing the\r\n\r\nregulations  governing hawkers. He  has  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we  should pass further regulations  to  see\r\n\r\nthat   the  food  is  covered.  We  already   have\r\n\r\nregulations  requiring food to be covered,  either\r\n\r\nin  transit or on display for sale. Presumably  in\r\n\r\nthis instance, my health inspectors have been very\r\n\r\nkind  and  flexible  in  the  enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will agree with me that the\r\n\r\ninspectors  in my Department do not have  an  easy\r\n\r\njob.  As  a result, I am finding it very difficult\r\n\r\nto   recruit   the  full  complement   of   health\r\n\r\ninspectors.  The staff turnover is great.  So  not\r\n\r\nonly  must  the health inspector be firm,  but  he\r\n\r\nmust also be tactful. That is why, as I have said,\r\n\r\nwe have set up a training department to teach them\r\n\r\nnot only the know-how of the job but also to teach\r\n\r\nthem the right way to deal with the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned a case of\r\n\r\nunfair  confiscation on the  part  of  the  health\r\n\r\ninspectors in his constituency.

And if he is not satisfied  with\r\n\r\nit, he can give me the details and I will find out\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  other  side of  the  picture.

What  is  the\r\n\r\npoint  of having a Hawkers Department if we  allow\r\n\r\nevery Tom, Dick and Harry to just go out and hawk.\r\n\r\nHere, we are spending millions of dollars engaging\r\n\r\ninspectors,  teaching  them  how  to  enforce  the\r\n\r\nregulations,  organising  campaigns   for   better\r\n\r\nhealth standards -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Minister prepared to give way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Member need not seek clarification now\r\n\r\nbecause  by the time I have finished I would  have\r\n\r\nmade it very clear to him what I mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the point of having a Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment and spending so much money on campaigns\r\n\r\non   antipollution,  Keep  Singapore  Clean,  Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Green, better food for  better  health,\r\n\r\nwhen,  on  the other hand, Members say, \"Let  them\r\n\r\nhawk.   These  are  difficult  cases.   They   are\r\n\r\nsuffering.\" Our policy is to see that all  hawkers\r\n\r\nare  sited  in centres where they can  sell  their\r\n\r\nfood  in  really good surroundings with  amenities\r\n\r\nlike potable water; where they can keep themselves\r\n\r\nand  the  food  they sell clean and  can  practise\r\n\r\nhealth  hygiene.  This i5 the reason  why  we  are\r\n\r\nspending so much money. On the one hand,  we  hear\r\n\r\nthe Member for Toa Payoh saying that we should  go\r\n\r\ndown and see that hawkers prepare their food under\r\n\r\nvery  sanitary conditions and, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwe  have an appeal saying, \"Please let them sell\".\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, there are hardship cases, of course.\r\n\r\nDefinitely. A lot of our people have gone  through\r\n\r\na  lot of hardships. Resettlement causes a lot  of\r\n\r\nhardships.  There  is  no doubt  about  that.  But\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been able to survive  because  our\r\n\r\npopulation is able to adapt themselves to changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  and  it  is  our  policy  not   to\r\n\r\nencourage hawking especially for young able-bodied\r\n\r\npeople as there is a shortage of skilled labour in\r\n\r\nthe  more productive sectors of our economy.  They\r\n\r\ncan  be trained and they should be trained. In our\r\n\r\nopinion,  there are 31,000 hawkers  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbona  fide  licensed hawkers, and this  number  is\r\n\r\nsufficient for the needs of Singapore. If  I  were\r\n\r\nto  accede  to  the  request  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang, then the policy of moving hawkers  into\r\n\r\ncentres with healthy and sanitary surroundings, so\r\n\r\nthat there would be no outbreaks of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncholera  and typhoid, will be defeated. The  whole\r\n\r\npolicy will be defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While sympathising with the Member for Changi on\r\n\r\nthe  plight  of  his constituents, here  again,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  accede to his request to allow the hawkers\r\n\r\nin his constituency to sell in two places. If that\r\n\r\nis  allowed, then the whole policy will  go  awry.\r\n\r\nThere is already a shortage of suitable places  to\r\n\r\nrehouse another 16,000 bona fide hawkers and  here\r\n\r\nI  am being asked, \"Will you allow the hawkers  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency to sell at this place for  a  few\r\n\r\nhours  and  then in another place for another  few\r\n\r\nhours?\" Very soon all the MPs will come up  to  me\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"Can you do the same for  my  hawkers?\"\r\n\r\nWhat will the result be? We move them into what we\r\n\r\nthink  are  suitable areas and they can  do  their\r\n\r\ntrade  under  sanitary  conditions.  This  is  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi stated that the former\r\n\r\ninspector   understood   the   difficulties   and,\r\n\r\naccording to him, allowed the hawkers to  sell  in\r\n\r\ntwo places. Whether it is the former inspector  or\r\n\r\nthe  new  inspector, he knows the policy. If  that\r\n\r\nhas  been allowed in the past, then there has been\r\n\r\nsome neglect on the part of that inspector. It  is\r\n\r\nnot the policy to allow that because otherwise  it\r\n\r\nwill defeat the policy that has been decided by my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we have to continue with very firm\r\n\r\naction  against unlicensed hawkers.  If  we  allow\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers to continue hawking  then  the\r\n\r\nwhole purpose of licensing them and resiting  them\r\n\r\ninto hawker centres will be defeated. We find that\r\n\r\nthe  only most effective way to dissuade them from\r\n\r\nillegal hawking is to confiscate their goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am unable to assure the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nor   for   that  matter  the  Members  for   other\r\n\r\nconstituencies, that hawker centres will be  built\r\n\r\nin  places within their own constituencies.  As  I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier,  there is  limited  space  and\r\n\r\nlimited finance. It would be ideal if we can build\r\n\r\na  hawker centre for each and every MP and in  the\r\n\r\nplace of their choice together with sufficient\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspace   to   allot   enough   stalls   for   their\r\n\r\nconstituents. But unfortunately the ideal  is  not\r\n\r\nattainable because of certain limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already spent $4.2 million. For 1975-76,\r\n\r\nwe  are  providing another $4.2 million for hawker\r\n\r\ncentres and markets. We have spent quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney already. We have built 20 markets and hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.   They  are  under  various   stages   of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  But to build hawker  centres  in  a\r\n\r\nplace  which Members consider ideal and which  the\r\n\r\nhawkers consider ideal, is beyond our capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards medical examination for hawkers,\r\n\r\nwe  are doing that. But we cannot do it for  every\r\n\r\nhawker. It is free, I know, but the hawkers  would\r\n\r\nsuffer  because  it will take one week  to  really\r\n\r\nexamine  them as we are doing now when  we  resite\r\n\r\nthem  and  put them in hawker centres. And  during\r\n\r\nthis  time  they  will lose their earnings.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  there are 31,000 hawkers and together  with\r\n\r\ntheir  assistants, there will be about 40,000-odd.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is almost physically impossible to examine\r\n\r\nall  of  them. So we do what we can. If  there  is\r\n\r\ntrace of any outbreak of cholera or typhoid in any\r\n\r\narea,  we  go there and we really examine  all  of\r\n\r\nthem  in  that  area. But medical examination  and\r\n\r\nscreening does not mean that hereafter he will not\r\n\r\nbe  a  danger  to the public. He can  still  be  a\r\n\r\ndanger  to the public if he subsequently comes  in\r\n\r\ncontact with typhoid or cholera germs. And if  his\r\n\r\npersonal  hygiene is not up to standard,  he  will\r\n\r\npass  it  on.  I  think the best means  of  making\r\n\r\nhawkers  realise  that clean personal  habits  are\r\n\r\nessential  would be for members of the  public  to\r\n\r\navoid  hawkers  with dirty habits.  That  is  more\r\n\r\neffective  than  all  the  fines  imposed  by   my\r\n\r\ninspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the suggestion that we should\r\n\r\ninspect and supervise food prepared by hawkers  in\r\n\r\nsquatter areas, here again it is not practical. We\r\n\r\nare already short of doctors and, as I said, I  am\r\n\r\nfinding  it  very  difficult  to  recruit   health\r\n\r\ninspectors. To supervise the preparation  of  food\r\n\r\nby   every  hawker  in  every  squatter  area   is\r\n\r\nimpracticable. Members know that different hawkers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsell their food at different times of the day  and\r\n\r\nthe  food is therefore prepared at different times\r\n\r\ntoo. It is physically impossible to carry out this\r\n\r\nsuggestion. The only way to ensure that  they  are\r\n\r\nclean is to allow only licensed hawkers to sell in\r\n\r\nhawker  centres under sanitary conditions, closely\r\n\r\nand strictly supervised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any Member remains unsatisfied because I\r\n\r\nhave  missed  replying to their  questions,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to answer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, it is very hard to please the Minister. I\r\n\r\nhave  never  mentioned about allowing  every  Tom,\r\n\r\nDick  and  Harry to hawk all over  the  place.  My\r\n\r\nrequest  is that those fishermen, who are old  and\r\n\r\nunable to fish because they have been resettled in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats far away from  the  sea,  be\r\n\r\ngiven licences in Bedok New Town where markets and\r\n\r\nstalls  will  be built. That is my  question,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is my plea. I am not asking the Minister  to\r\n\r\nallow everyone to hawk. At the present moment,  as\r\n\r\nI  said,  the reason why these hawkers are hawking\r\n\r\nat  one  place  at a certain time and  at  another\r\n\r\nplace at a different time is because at that place\r\n\r\nin  Changi there is no market or no proper  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre and therefore this problem has arisen.

May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that spot checks be made in the  interest\r\n\r\nof hygiene?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while on this point, may I just assist the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Changi? The hawker centres  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  constructed  in his constituency  may  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  management of the Housing  Board,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are certain provisions under the  rules  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board that bona fide cases of hardship\r\n\r\nwill be given places. I do not think his case will\r\n\r\ncome under the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, my colleagues, the Backbenchers, and the\r\n\r\npublic  outside  are puzzled.

I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nit  is  the policy of the Government to confiscate\r\n\r\nthe  goods  of licensed hawkers if they  commit  a\r\n\r\ncertain  offence. Is it really necessary  to  take\r\n\r\nsuch  a drastic step as confiscation of his goods?\r\n\r\nThis is my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is not the policy to confiscate the goods. But\r\n\r\nthere  must be other good reasons. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nabout  this particular case and I do not think  we\r\n\r\nshould waste time on particular instances. If  the\r\n\r\nMember  wants it to be clarified, please write  to\r\n\r\nme giving details of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, there may be justification for doing that to\r\n\r\nan  unlicensed hawker. But what I am talking about\r\n\r\nis  that of a licensed hawker. He cannot run away.\r\n\r\nHe  can  be summoned for whatever offence  he  has\r\n\r\ncommitted;   but   why   should   the   Government\r\n\r\nconfiscate his goods? This is my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> As I say, I do not know about the case. It could\r\n\r\nbe  that  the hawker was told, \"Would  you  please\r\n\r\nmove your goods as you are blocking traffic?\"  The\r\n\r\nhawker was probably recalcitrant and said, \"Go  to\r\n\r\nhell  with you. I will remove it at my own  time.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  was taken away. It could  be  like\r\n\r\nthis; I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nputs  up its logo in every market place and hawker\r\n\r\ncentre    under   its   control.

For the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nto  control hawkers all over Singapore  is  a  bit\r\n\r\nunwieldy.  So  it is a question of  administrative\r\n\r\nexpediency. Authorities or statutory bodies  which\r\n\r\nbuild  markets or hawker centres within their  own\r\n\r\nestates look after them, but they all observe  the\r\n\r\nsame Hawker Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if fishermen can become good\r\n\r\nhawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They can try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are not encouraging hawking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it will be better for the fishermen to\r\n\r\nengage in some other occupation. I doubt very much\r\n\r\nwhether a good fisherman can become a good hawker.\r\n\r\nHe  will probably go bankrupt in no time. We would\r\n\r\nprobably  save him a lot of trouble by not  giving\r\n\r\nhim  a  licence. But as we are unable to  resettle\r\n\r\nall  bona  tide hawkers into designated areas,  we\r\n\r\nare not issuing new licences. The problem will  be\r\n\r\na  perennial one. On the one hand, we are not able\r\n\r\nto  accommodate all bona fide hawkers and, on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, we are issuing more licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now I heard the Minister say that he\r\n\r\nwould  not  encourage more people  to  do  hawking\r\n\r\nbecause  there are already enough hawkers  around.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  present regulations the  department\r\n\r\nconcerned  is permitting those over 40 years  old,\r\n\r\nwhose   livelihood  is  difficult  and   who   are\r\n\r\nreceiving public assistance, to be hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, for every rule there is an exception. Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in real cases of hardship we will make  an\r\n\r\nexception.   One   exception  is   that   national\r\n\r\nservicemen   who  are  trained  as  cooks   during\r\n\r\nnational  service  and  have become  exceptionally\r\n\r\ngood  cooks and who have discharged their national\r\n\r\nservice   liability  well  will,  if   there   are\r\n\r\nvacancies  in the markets, be issued  with  hawker\r\n\r\nlicences. This is a reward for good service in the\r\n\r\narmy and an encouragement to people to cook better\r\n\r\nand more tasty food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there are several points I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  to  supplement  the  replies  given  by   my\r\n\r\nMinister.  The  Member  for  Jurong  made  certain\r\n\r\ncomments  concerning hawkers  and  the  siting  of\r\n\r\nhawker centres. At the moment the matter is  dealt\r\n\r\nwith by several departments, the HDB, PSA, and the\r\n\r\nJTC  besides the Ministry of the Environment.  The\r\n\r\npresent  arrangement is this.  In  regard  to  the\r\n\r\ndesigning or planning of hawker centres, if it  is\r\n\r\nto  be  in, say Jurong Town area, then it is dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the Jurong Town Corporation. Because if it\r\n\r\nis  not  handled  by them there  will  be  certain\r\n\r\ninconveniences  and  difficulties  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nchoice of site, supervision, etc. This resulted in\r\n\r\nthe  various  authorities  being  responsible  for\r\n\r\ncontrol of hawkers in their own areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of whether or not a Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament should be consulted in the  setting\r\n\r\nup  of a hawker centre in his constituency, in  so\r\n\r\nfar   as  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment   is\r\n\r\nconcerned  the Member of Parliament concerned  has\r\n\r\ngenerally been consulted in the choice of a  site.\r\n\r\nAs  regards Jurong, two reasons could be given for\r\n\r\nthe  Member's complaint. The first is that the JTC\r\n\r\nhas  only  recently  set up a hawkers  department.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  two of the sites chosen are  extensions\r\n\r\nof  old  market places. Since the sites have  been\r\n\r\nfixed,   there   is  hardly  any  possibility   of\r\n\r\nreversing the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about unlicensed hawkers in\r\n\r\nJurong.  At that time the JTC had not yet  set  up\r\n\r\nits  own  hawkers  department,  and  moreover  the\r\n\r\nfactories  there  were in need of their  services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the JTC could only decide on the  sites\r\n\r\nfor  the hawker centres in Jurong Town, while  the\r\n\r\nexpenses and the management thereof came under our\r\n\r\ncontrol.  But now any new hawker centre in  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown will be managed by the JTC authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang mentioned about\r\n\r\nnewsvendors.  According  to  our  records,  if   a\r\n\r\nnewsvendor  does not have a stall  at  a  definite\r\n\r\nplace, he need not hold a hawker licence. We  have\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  any  action  against such  news-vendors.  A\r\n\r\nnewsvendors  normally delivers the newspaper  from\r\n\r\nhouse to house on a bicycle. But if he sets  up  a\r\n\r\nstall,  he  would be bound by certain regulations,\r\n\r\nand  we will then take measures to deal with  him.\r\n\r\nAs  we have said, it is easy to talk but difficult\r\n\r\nto   practise.  So  it  is  very  well   to   give\r\n\r\nencouraging answers to please people, but it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  practical if in the end  they  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfulfilled. In this regard I hope many Members will\r\n\r\nagree with my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia many countries with Parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocratic systems have failed. It is because  the\r\n\r\ngovernments in these countries could only pay lip-service and could not actually practise what  they\r\n\r\npreached,   which  caused  the  degeneration   and\r\n\r\nsubsequent   dismemberment  of   the   governments\r\n\r\nconcerned.  On  the other hand, in the  course  of\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  of  our policy if  we  desist  from\r\n\r\naction   for  fear  of  adversely  affecting   the\r\n\r\ninterests of a minority, then we shall not be able\r\n\r\nto  accomplish  anything. If  we  want  to  please\r\n\r\neverybody, we would not be able to succeed in  our\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  government. However,  in  a  densely\r\n\r\npopulated  country like ours, if  we  do  not  pay\r\n\r\nattention to the time factor then, to my mind, the\r\n\r\ncountry will in future be in dire difficulties. It\r\n\r\nis  only  when we can make full use  of  the  time\r\n\r\navailable  and  avail ourselves of the  favourable\r\n\r\nconditions  around us that we can  carry  out  our\r\n\r\npolicy  of bringing a better life for our  country\r\n\r\nand our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to add relates to what\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Changi had said about the problems\r\n\r\nof  the  fishermen. The Member for Toa  Payoh  has\r\n\r\nalso  added  the  point about  the  management  of\r\n\r\nhawkers by the HDB. According to my understanding,\r\n\r\nthe   Resettlement  Department  of  the  HDB  will\r\n\r\nusually   bring  the  matter  to  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nauthority  which has jurisdiction over the  matter\r\n\r\nconcerned. In other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwords,  if  the  matter raised comes  under  their\r\n\r\njurisdiction,  such  as when there  are  vacancies\r\n\r\nleft,  the  department  concerned  would  try   to\r\n\r\naccommodate such people like resettled  fishermen.\r\n\r\nOther  matters  will  be taken  up  by  the  other\r\n\r\nrelevant  departments  concerned.  I  myself  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable experience dealing with HDB  hawkers.\r\n\r\nUnder  normal circumstances if a hawker centre  is\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  an HDB estate and ready for allocation,\r\n\r\nthen   the  Estate  Officer  of  the  Area  Office\r\n\r\nconcerned will discuss with the MP concerned about\r\n\r\nresettlement  cases  and  other  matters  relating\r\n\r\nthereto.  So  in the circumstances I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi would be consulted by the  Area\r\n\r\nOffice  concerned when the fishermen  in  question\r\n\r\nwere to be resettled, so that the matter could  be\r\n\r\nsolved amicably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In view of the lengthy reply, although it is not\r\n\r\nvery  satisfactory,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
