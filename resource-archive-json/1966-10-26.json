Members that at 10.30\r\n\r\na.m. on the 18th of October, 1966, I received to hand a\r\n\r\nletter  dated the 8th of October, 1966, signed  by  Mr\r\n\r\nChia  Thye Poh who was elected to this House as  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong. This letter was delivered to my office  on\r\n\r\nthe  8th  of October, 1966. The material part  of  this\r\n\r\nletter reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the Party\" (i.e, the Barisan Sosialis) \"has decided\r\n\r\nthat    all   Barisan   'MPs'   will   resign    their\r\n\r\n'Parliamentary' seats as from today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 Barisan MPs are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

Any\r\n\r\nresignation   to  be  effective  must,  amongst   other\r\n\r\nrequirements,  be  by writing under  the  hand  of  the\r\n\r\nMember concerned and of no one else. I have, therefore,\r\n\r\ncome  to the conclusion that the letter signed  by  Mr\r\n\r\nChia  Thye Poh is ineffective for its expressed purpose\r\n\r\nin so far as the following 7 persons are concerned:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mr Koo Young - Member for Thomson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mr Ong Lian Teng - Member for Bukit Panjang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Mr Poh Ber Liak - Member for Tampines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Mr Tan Cheng Tong - Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Miss Loh Miaw Gong - Member for Havelock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Mr Chan Sun Wing - Member for Nee Soon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Mr Wong Soon Fong - Member for Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh's own position caused me further difficulty in that, although the letter was under his hand and was addressed to me, he did not, in so many words, \"resign his seat\". However, after studying the matter and giving it considerable thought, I have come to the clear conclusion that Mr Chia Thye Poh's\r\n\r\npersonal intention was to resign his seat and  that  he\r\n\r\nhas adequately given effect to that intention by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsigning  that  letter addressed to me in the  terms  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it was written and by causing that letter to  be\r\n\r\ndelivered to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have to inform hon.

I  am  prepared  to  revise  this  rule  by\r\n\r\nincluding widowers who are 65 years and above. However,\r\n\r\nthe Government has examined the question of whether the\r\n\r\nage limit should be lowered to 60 years and has come to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that,  for the  moment,  it  would  be\r\n\r\ninadvisable indeed to permit immigration of aged people\r\n\r\nbelow 65 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the House is aware that as a little\r\n\r\nisland  State,  it  is very necessary  indeed  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  exercise a firm immigration policy.

The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  applications  which  were  rejected  were\r\n\r\nmainly  because the applications referred to those  who\r\n\r\nwere  below 65 years old. Another major reason was that\r\n\r\nthe applicant was living with other children either  in\r\n\r\nChina   or  in  India,  and  therefore  could  not   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also further emphasise that this regulation\r\n\r\nconcerning  admission  of aged parents  into  Singapore\r\n\r\nrefers  expressly to widows or widowers and that  these\r\n\r\npersons should provide full evidence that they have  no\r\n\r\nother  means  of support if they are not  permitted  to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore. I can assure the Member,  as  I  have\r\n\r\ndone  at  the  last sitting, that all applications  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  on compassionate grounds but, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we have also got to be fair not only to ourselves\r\n\r\nbut  to  the State so that we do not see that Singapore\r\n\r\nis encumbered with unnecessary social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): A\r\n\r\nsupplementary question, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned this\r\n\r\nquestion. In my constituency there is a resident who is\r\n\r\na  citizen of Singapore and who has a mother of over 60\r\n\r\nyears  of  age in China. Several years ago  he  made  a\r\n\r\nrequest  for her to come to Singapore but  it  was  not\r\n\r\napproved.  The  reason was that he had  a  relative  in\r\n\r\nChina to support her.

It  is, therefore,  logical  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  join  in international communication  projects,\r\n\r\nand  SEACOM  is such a project. We should, however,  be\r\n\r\nable   to   know   the   extent  of  our   commitments.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our resources are limited  and  we  must\r\n\r\nmake  the best use of them. From the estimates,  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  our original commitment was some $10 million.  We\r\n\r\nare  now, however, asked to increase our commitment  by\r\n\r\nsome  $2 million. The reason given is that the increase\r\n\r\nis  necessary because of the re-routing and increase in\r\n\r\nthe  capacity of the cable. It is, therefore,  relevant\r\n\r\nto  ask  whether  Singapore was consulted  on  the  re-routing and also on the increase in the capacity of the\r\n\r\ncable to be laid. Can the Minister assure us that  this\r\n\r\nwill  not be an open-handed commitment in which we will\r\n\r\nbe  asked  to  increase our contribution from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  to clarify the doubts of the Member for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang, I would like to inform the House that the re-routing  of the SEACOM cable was contingent on  account\r\n\r\nof  Indonesian confrontation. The original plan  called\r\n\r\nfor  a  cable  which would run from  Australia  to  New\r\n\r\nGuinea,  New  Guinea  to Jesselton,  and  Jesselton  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, when confrontation  broke  out  in\r\n\r\n1963, the plan had to be revised, and consequently  the\r\n\r\ncable went up to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Guam, Guam  to\r\n\r\nNew Guinea and New Guinea to Australia. Singapore, as a\r\n\r\npartner  of  SEACOM, has always been consulted  on  any\r\n\r\nchanges in plans in cable routing, and the increase  in\r\n\r\ncapacity is to the advantage of all SEACOM partners. In\r\n\r\nfact,  from  what I gathered just now, the forecast  is\r\n\r\nthat even the capacity of 160 two-way channels will  be\r\n\r\nvery  much limited in the near future, when the project\r\n\r\nitself  opens. That is one of the reasons why ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  are  now  being studied as  to  how  to  improve\r\n\r\ntelecommunications between SEACOM neighbours -  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Australia on the one hand, and Singapore\r\n\r\nand Tokyo, and Singapore and Europe, on the other hand.\r\n\r\nI can assure the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu Kang that all plans have been considered very\r\n\r\ncarefully.  It  is  not  the intention  of  the  SEACOM\r\n\r\npartnership to waste money unnecessarily.

The\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of outpatient attendances  and\r\n\r\noperations shows that the people involved are not well-to-do people and if we increase the number of wards  to\r\n\r\npaying-class   wards,  this  will  not   overcome   the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, may I answer the criticism of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa  Chu  Kang in the first place? I  believe  he\r\n\r\nindicated  that  there  was not enough  information  in\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd.  24  of 1966 on the request for  additional\r\n\r\nfunds to provide improvements to the Orthopaedic Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a little background history of\r\n\r\nthis particular item - Improvements for the Orthopaedic\r\n\r\nUnit in Outram Road Hospital. The original plan was  as\r\n\r\nlate  as  1958  - eight years ago  -  and  it  was  then\r\n\r\nsomething like a $ 1\ufffd million proposal which in  1959  I\r\n\r\nfelt was excessive, and I had it brought down to a  sum\r\n\r\nof  $300,000. There were therefore considerable savings\r\n\r\nfor  the State of more than $1 million. Of this reduced\r\n\r\nsum of $300,000, unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nprovided  only $50,000 for 1966. Later on, an  approved\r\n\r\ntransfer of $75,000 was granted, and the request in the\r\n\r\nCommand Paper is for a sum of $224,400 which is  really\r\n\r\nin keeping with a contract which has been let for a sum\r\n\r\nof $339,967.80. This does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninclude,  however, a vote for \"Furniture and Equipment\"\r\n\r\nwhich  is  estimated at nearly $110,000, but  this  sum\r\n\r\nwill be entered in next year's Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that will meet the Member's request for more\r\n\r\ninformation on the expenditure of this sum of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer his second question that the outpatient\r\n\r\nservice in the hospital is bad, I am sorry to hear that\r\n\r\nhe has had an unhappy experience in the hospital and  I\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate  it if he would put  this  matter  in\r\n\r\nwriting, indicating the day when he was at the hospital\r\n\r\nand  where  he felt he had not been fairly treated,  so\r\n\r\nthat I can investigate further into the matter. Because\r\n\r\nI think it is pretty dangerous sometimes just to listen\r\n\r\nto  one  complaint and \"tar\" the whole service.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion  -  as  the Member himself has admitted  -  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  might have been grossly over-worked  and  were\r\n\r\ntherefore  perhaps a little short of temper during  the\r\n\r\nwee  hours of the morning. However, if I can  get  more\r\n\r\ninformation,  I  will be in a position  to  investigate\r\n\r\ninto  the matter fully and give a firm decision on  it.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think that it is as simple as suggested by\r\n\r\nthe Member, that to meet the situation, all we need  do\r\n\r\nis  to  employ more doctors. It is not that we  do  not\r\n\r\nwish   to  employ  more  doctors.  There  are  on   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  450 doctors, and at the moment  we  have\r\n\r\nclose  to 400 doctors. The vacancies are there.  It  is\r\n\r\navailable  for  any doctor who wishes to  apply  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for appointment, and it is very rarely  that\r\n\r\nwe  turn down any application from a doctor who  wishes\r\n\r\nto join Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards improvements to the conditions of service,\r\n\r\netc.,  this is something which I, as a Minister,  would\r\n\r\nvery  much  like  to  encourage and support.  But  here\r\n\r\nagain, there is my colleague, the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, there is already a Salaries Commission in\r\n\r\nexistence  and I do not think that we should anticipate\r\n\r\nevents  or  to  say  things which would  embarrass  the\r\n\r\nworking of this Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered the comments of the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang  and I will now answer the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not appear to be happy over the fact that the\r\n\r\nfunds asked for are for the renovation of Wards 61  and\r\n\r\n62  into paying-class wards, because he feels that this\r\n\r\nwould not meet the situation of those less able to  pay\r\n\r\nafter being admitted into the hospital. It is important\r\n\r\nto  remind him that the majority of cases admitted into\r\n\r\nthe  Orthopaedic  Unit  are  in  respect  of  accidents\r\n\r\narising  out of employment or motor traffic. In  almost\r\n\r\nevery  instance, it is the employer who will be bearing\r\n\r\nthe expenses for such treatment. Therefore, it will not\r\n\r\nin  any  way increase the burden for the less fortunate\r\n\r\nmembers of our public if they are admitted into  paying\r\n\r\nwards, because it is the employer who will have to meet\r\n\r\nsuch   liability   under  the  workmen's   compensation\r\n\r\ninsurance which every good employer takes up to protect\r\n\r\nhis liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the numerous accidents which we have -\r\n\r\nsomething like 100 motor accidents a day - every car on\r\n\r\nthe  road  is  covered  compulsorily  with  third-party\r\n\r\ninsurance, and therefore personal injuries as a  result\r\n\r\nof   motor   accidents  are  rightful  claims   against\r\n\r\ninsurance companies. I have already indicated  sometime\r\n\r\nago  that  it is our intention to make it so,  so  that\r\n\r\ninsurance companies will meet these dues. In the  past,\r\n\r\nfor  some queer reasons, the Government hospitals  have\r\n\r\nnot  taken  the  trouble  to send  bills  to  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  I  think it is time that  this  serious\r\n\r\nloophole in the revenue of the State should be plugged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can therefore assure the Member for Kampong Kapor\r\n\r\nthat   by  having  more  paying-class  wards   in   our\r\n\r\nOrthopaedic Units we shall not be penalising the poorer\r\n\r\nsections  of the public, because we shall  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecover  most  of the dues from employers or  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  It is anticipated that we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nget  at least $\ufffd million each year by this process  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  shall  be able to  recover  all  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure probably in a matter of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We should  therefore  make  our\r\n\r\npolicy  known to all our people at home and to  project\r\n\r\nour  image  abroad, and the best means of doing  so  is\r\n\r\nthrough the television and radio services. But it  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that this House will approve some $6\ufffd million\r\n\r\nwithout  knowing how the money is going to be spent.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the sum is in addition to the  sum  of\r\n\r\nmore than $3 million that has already been spent on the\r\n\r\nnew Television House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I would like to say about\r\n\r\ntelevision, and that is commercial advertising.  Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  appreciate  that  it  may  be  necessary  to  allow\r\n\r\ncommercial advertising in television to help it pay its\r\n\r\nway, commercial advertising seems to be now getting out\r\n\r\nof  hand,  especially during what are called the  \"peak\r\n\r\nhours\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the amount of advertising time is fast approaching\r\n\r\nthat  of  the ordinary programme time.

Included in  this\r\n\r\nexpansion  scheme  are  additional  and  more  powerful\r\n\r\ntransmitters   for  both  radio  and   television   and\r\n\r\nadditional studio facilities for television. The sum of\r\n\r\nabout  $6\ufffd million is therefore required. Actually  the\r\n\r\ntotal sum involved is $6.5 million and the breakdown is\r\n\r\nas follows -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radio Service - radio transmitters are about $2.5\r\n\r\nmillion,  the frequency modulated transmitter  is  over\r\n\r\n$300,000,  and  there is also some payment  of  customs\r\n\r\nduties  which  amount  to  $160,000.  T.V.  Service  to\r\n\r\nincrease  T.V. cover amounts to about  $870,000;  T.V.\r\n\r\nequipment (non-engineering) is about $570,000. And  the\r\n\r\nStudios - four T.V. studios - works and buildings  cost\r\n\r\nabout $400,000, and equipment about $1.4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second query in which the hon.

Compared\r\n\r\nwith  other countries, Mr Speaker, Sir, the  frequency\r\n\r\nof   advertisements  appearing  on  T.V. here  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, Sir, the cost of\r\n\r\nrunning T.V.

The first point  is  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to disturb the present natural environment of\r\n\r\nMacRitchie Reservoir. The second point is whether, even\r\n\r\nif  it  is  decided that we should do so, it is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion of wrong priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nMacRitchie Reservoir is a natural beautiful park as  it\r\n\r\nis.  I  have  visited it, and it has all the  aesthetic\r\n\r\nfeatures  of a natural environment - tall shady  trees,\r\n\r\nsoft  green  grass,  birds  singing  overhead,  insects\r\n\r\nhumming around. Mr Speaker, Sir, attap shelters cannot\r\n\r\ntake  the  place  of shady trees, and  paved  footpaths\r\n\r\ncannot  take  the  place of soft  green  grass,  and  a\r\n\r\nfloating  fountain and a tea kiosk will not, I  submit,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, improve the aesthetic features of the\r\n\r\npark.  When  concrete and mortar  and  a  motorway  are\r\n\r\nbrought  in,  the  natural  environment  of  MacRitchie\r\n\r\nReservoir will be no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that the P.W.D. will be in charge of the\r\n\r\nproject. The P.W.D. is a solid, hardworking department.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it has so far not proved itself  capable\r\n\r\nof being the author of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naesthetically  beautiful  project.  Take  the   Raffles\r\n\r\nUnderground Car Park and Garden, Sir. It is  functional\r\n\r\nbut it is ugly. It has a fountain and a flower bed, but\r\n\r\nfountains  and flower beds alone do not make  beautiful\r\n\r\ngardens.   It   is  the  arrangement  -   the   overall\r\n\r\narrangement  -  of  these things that  makes  beautiful\r\n\r\ngardens.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if Mount Faber  is  another\r\n\r\nplace  to judge by, I feel very apprehensive about  the\r\n\r\nnatural  beauty of our park at MacRitchie Reservoir.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think we have improved Mount Faber, scenically\r\n\r\nspeaking.  On  the other hand, I have heard  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints that the cosiness of the place, the  romance\r\n\r\nof it, is being spoilt. The harsh public lighting is no\r\n\r\nsubstitute for the soft moonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even granted that we are so insensitive as to\r\n\r\nprefer  a man-made fountain to a natural running stream\r\n\r\nand  decide that this project should be proceeded with,\r\n\r\nregardless, there is still the question of priority  to\r\n\r\nbe  considered. We are a small country. Our  resources,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  said  just  now,  are  limited.  We  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  make  the best use of  them.  We  are  here\r\n\r\nproposing  to spend a quarter of a million  dollars  on\r\n\r\nsomething  that  needs no improvement, whilst,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  in  the rural areas basic  amenities  like\r\n\r\nelectricity and piped water have not been provided for.\r\n\r\nIn  my constituency in Choa Chu Kang, for example, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are areas - and indeed large areas - where there\r\n\r\nis  not  even  piped water, not to say  the  luxury  of\r\n\r\npublic  lighting. And the money to be  spent  on  these\r\n\r\nprojects could be better spent, I submit, on the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a quarter of a million dollars could be channelled\r\n\r\ninto  the rural areas, it would do a tremendous lot  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  basic  standard of living  of  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  It would be little comfort to the rural  folks\r\n\r\nto  be  told  by the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nthat  they  could watch coloured water playing  in  the\r\n\r\nfloating  fountain in MacRitchie Reservoir,  when  they\r\n\r\nhave  not even piped water at home to drink or to  use.\r\n\r\nThat  is the irony of this project, Sir, and I  beg  to\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on this\r\n\r\nnew subhead 024, I would like to know from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Law and National Development whether the purpose of\r\n\r\nthis vote is to make a park for the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith the idea of reducing the dust and filth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier about my suspicions regarding\r\n\r\npayments  made to the Ministry of Health, I  am  rather\r\n\r\nworried  if  the use of the car park, as  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthis  scheme,  is to be paid for, as  is  done  at  the\r\n\r\nAirport at present, because it will be a burden to  the\r\n\r\npeople  who want to make use of the car park. Normally,\r\n\r\npeople  who  visit parks like MacRitchie Reservoir  are\r\n\r\nusually poor. Although we see them going there in cars,\r\n\r\nthese cars are sometimes borrowed from their friends or\r\n\r\nhired.  For example, on a Saturday if someone wants  to\r\n\r\ngo  for a ride or stroll in MacRitchie Reservoir during\r\n\r\nthe  day, he has to pay car park charges at High Street\r\n\r\nand then in the evening he will have to pay again. This\r\n\r\nwill be a burden, Mr Speaker. There are also occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  rich  people go to the parks, but they  will  not\r\n\r\nmake visits to MacRitchie Reservoir as they have better\r\n\r\nplaces  to  go to which are in line with their  status.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  also rich people who go to  MacRitchie\r\n\r\nReservoir.  I  would like to know once again  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned whether the use  of  the  car  park\r\n\r\nproposed in this scheme will be paid for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould like to speak on this item to express some of  my\r\n\r\npersonal  views.  On  the question  of  establishing  a\r\n\r\npaying  car  park,  some Members have  expressed  their\r\n\r\nobjection to paying car parks in certain areas. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat in some places it is necessary to have paying  car\r\n\r\nparks. For example, on a public holiday many people  go\r\n\r\nto  the MacRitchie Reservoir grounds. So if there is  a\r\n\r\ncar park, it will be a great convenience to the holiday\r\n\r\nmakers and visitors. And if the authority should impose\r\n\r\na   fee  of,  say,  40  cents  per  hour  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nreasonable.  Otherwise, without this  imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nfee, there will be some jaga kereta boys operating in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis area. They will demand payment from motorists,  an\r\n\r\nact  which  is illegal. So the payment of 40 cents  per\r\n\r\nhour  or  20  cents per half hour is quite a reasonable\r\n\r\nmeasure.  Government will in turn provide the necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  make use of the money  in  some  other\r\n\r\nfields and the public will benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst it is desirable\r\n\r\nthat  development should, as far as possible, be spread\r\n\r\nthroughout the island so that our population living  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  constituencies are all catered  for,  the\r\n\r\nhard  economic facts are that it is necessary to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   total  quantum  of  funds  available   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects are utilised in the best  possible\r\n\r\nmanner.  Although it is the aim to provide as  large  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  the  population  as  possible  with   basic\r\n\r\namenities,  like light and water, the deterrent  factor\r\n\r\nis  often  the  heavy capital expenditure  involved  in\r\n\r\nbringing  electricity  and  water  supplies  to  remote\r\n\r\nkampongs   off   the  beaten  track.  Choa   Chu   Kang\r\n\r\nConstituency   is   one  such  area.  The   authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  in  deciding whether to extend  supplies  to\r\n\r\nspecific  areas have to have regard for  the  economics\r\n\r\ninvolved.  A  sufficient rate of return on the  capital\r\n\r\ninvested  is necessary so that the scheme is economical\r\n\r\nand  the  Public Utilities Board is able  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  World Bank  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nprescribed rate of returns for loans. Nevertheless,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Choa Chu Kang will be aware, during the\r\n\r\nlast  six years a sum of $700,160 has been expended  to\r\n\r\nprovide  water and electric services for Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nalone.  This figure of over $700,000 is only for  water\r\n\r\nand  lights, and has nothing to do with roads or  other\r\n\r\namenities. On water supplies alone a sum of $65,230 was\r\n\r\nspent.  On electric supplies a sum of $595,930.  Street\r\n\r\nlighting in the Member's constituency cost $39,000.  So\r\n\r\nas  far as Choa Chu Kang Road is concerned - this is  a\r\n\r\nroad  - water and electrical mains have been laid right\r\n\r\nup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the  end  of  the  road, and I can assure  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that Choa Chu Kang is a long road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other long road in that district is Lim Chu Kang\r\n\r\nRoad.  On that road electrical mains have been laid  up\r\n\r\nto  the  19th  milestone, two miles from  the  end.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  in  due course, supplies will be extended  upon\r\n\r\nrequest and, on the basis of determined priorities,  to\r\n\r\nextend these to the end. Despite all endeavours,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  villages  in  outlying  areas  far  from  the\r\n\r\nelectricity   and  water  mains  where   it   will   be\r\n\r\nexorbitantly   expensive  to  provide   the   necessary\r\n\r\namenities.  In  many of these areas, for  example,  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands, Changi, Tampines and Sembawang,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of consumers is relatively so small as to  make\r\n\r\nthe project completely uneconomical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the high cost involved can be seen from\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that to provide one mile of water  mains  in\r\n\r\nLorong  Buang  Kok,  the cost was nearly  $100,000.  To\r\n\r\nprovide  electric supplies to 290 houses  at  Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  Road from the 13\ufffd milestone to the 14\ufffd milestone,\r\n\r\njust  one mile, the cost was $163,740; while to provide\r\n\r\none  mile of street lighting from Bukit Panjang Village\r\n\r\nto  Yew Tee Village, the cost was $23,000. That I hope,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, should dispose of the Member's  arguments\r\n\r\nas to priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang also made the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  things at MacRitchie Reservoir should be left  in\r\n\r\ntheir  natural beauty. He does not want me  to  disturb\r\n\r\nthe  birds.  I  can  assure him  that  the  development\r\n\r\nenvisaged  at MacRitchie does not involve  the  cutting\r\n\r\ndown  of  trees  or  turning  the  reservoir  into   an\r\n\r\nartificial   garden.  The  development  envisages   the\r\n\r\nminimum  clearance of shrubs and undergrowth  only  and\r\n\r\nthe  provision of certain facilities, leaving the trees\r\n\r\nand  the landscape and the birds as far as possible  in\r\n\r\ntheir natural state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this town is expanding fast. There is an\r\n\r\nacute shortage of lungs and open spaces as a result  of\r\n\r\nour  tremendous housing programmes and the idea  behind\r\n\r\nthe MacRitchie scheme is to enable full utilisation  of\r\n\r\none existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen  space by the population. The Member for Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  will  agree that a healthy community is  a  vital\r\n\r\nnecessity.  The  provision of  facilities  like  a  tea\r\n\r\nkiosk, a bandstand and a fountain at minimal cost  will\r\n\r\nattract even more people to this already popular  spot.\r\n\r\nNot  only  will the people in the neighbouring  Thomson\r\n\r\nand  Sembawang  areas  but  also  those  from  outlying\r\n\r\ndistricts,  including Choa Chu Kang and Kampong  Kapor,\r\n\r\nwill  be attracted to spend a pleasant evening  in  the\r\n\r\nenvirons  of this reservoir by the provision  of  these\r\n\r\nminimal  facilities. A tea kiosk is necessary in  order\r\n\r\nto  keep out hawkers from the reservoir parks so as  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  chances  of  water pollution.  A  floating\r\n\r\nfountain  in  the reservoir itself should  enhance  the\r\n\r\nbeauty  of  the area at little expense. In  short,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the project envisages the enhancement  of  the\r\n\r\nnatural  beauty  of  the  place  by  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nadditional  features  and  not  the  creation   of   an\r\n\r\nartificial  garden. I am sure that when the development\r\n\r\nis  completed  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  will  be\r\n\r\npleased with the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor has been harping on the\r\n\r\ncharges  which, he says, we might introduce at the  car\r\n\r\npark.  He  says,  \"Do  not  charge.\"  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang says, \"Charge.\"\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  both Members that before any  fees  are\r\n\r\nimposed  careful consideration will have to  be  given.\r\n\r\nThere must be a period of trial and experiment. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  are no car parking fees  at  MacRitchie\r\n\r\nReservoir,  though, I believe, the place is  packed  in\r\n\r\nthe  evening and at night. We will only introduce  fees\r\n\r\nfor  parking  at MacRitchie should the demand  for  car\r\n\r\nparking  spaces  exceed the amount of space  available,\r\n\r\nand that, in fact, is the whole basis of car parking in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Unless we charge fees for parking,  the  day\r\n\r\nwill  come  in Singapore, and it will come  soon,  when\r\n\r\nthere is complete traffic chaos in the town. But no one\r\n\r\nhas moved an amendment to the other subhead which deals\r\n\r\nwith  the underground car park, so I will not make  any\r\n\r\ncomments except to say to the Member for Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nthat though he does not like the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderground  car  park at Raffles Place,  it  serves  a\r\n\r\nuseful  purpose and in fact a hundred per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ncar  parking  places at the Raffles Car  Park  are  now\r\n\r\nfully used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mount Faber, he is entitled to his own views.\r\n\r\nBut  you get a lovely view from Mount Faber, and if  he\r\n\r\ndoes not like it, I suggest he go elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the explanation given by the  Minister.\r\n\r\nWhile it may be quite true that a tremendous amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  is being spent in the rural areas - and  he  has\r\n\r\ngiven me figures for the amounts spent in Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\nin  respect  of water and lighting - the  fact  remains\r\n\r\nthat  in these rural areas the basic amenities of  life\r\n\r\nare  not satisfied. My thesis is that unless and  until\r\n\r\nsuch  amenities are satisfied, it is against  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples  that  the  urban  areas  should  be   given\r\n\r\namenities that are not the basic requirements of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that it is a matter of opinion whether Mount Faber is a better area after a tremendous amount of money has been spent on it. I do not think it improves it scenically and I am sure a lot of people do not think so. If that is the case, why should we spend money on something that is not\r\n\r\nnecessary  while, at the same time, leaving  the  basic\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  life  not  satisfied?   Take   public\r\n\r\nlighting in Mount Faber, for example. I am sure  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  appreciated there. In fact, I think it does  cause\r\n\r\nconsiderable  annoyance to a lot of people,  especially\r\n\r\nloving  young couples who visit Mount Faber. Funds  for\r\n\r\nsuch public lighting could very well be spent and would\r\n\r\nvery   much   be  appreciated  in,  for   example,   my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  That, Mr Speaker, Sir,  is  my  thesis:\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has got his priorities wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Choa Chu Kang argues that\r\n\r\nuntil  every  house in his district  is  supplied  with\r\n\r\nlight  and  water, my Ministry should not  do  anything\r\n\r\nabout building parks or fountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an argument which I cannot accept. It will\r\n\r\nprobably be 10 to 15 years before every householder  in\r\n\r\nhis  district is supplied with light and water. I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  the reasons why up to date water and electricity\r\n\r\nsupplies  have  not reached every remote  farm  in  his\r\n\r\ndistrict. Does it mean that I can do nothing to improve\r\n\r\nthe  urban  areas  until I have satisfied  every  basic\r\n\r\nrequirement of his constituency? I can assure him  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  spending more money every year  on  the  rural\r\n\r\ndistricts.  And this goes for every rural  district  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Urban areas receive much less; then come the\r\n\r\nsemi-urban or semi-rural districts; then come the rural\r\n\r\ndistricts. If we were spending more money on the  urban\r\n\r\ndistricts than on the rural districts, then I would say\r\n\r\nwe  are  wrong.  But  we are not doing  .that.  We  are\r\n\r\nspending  more money in his district, which  is  rural,\r\n\r\nthan,  say, my district in Tanglin which is semi-urban.\r\n\r\nBut  if  not every householder in his district of  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  has light and water, I can assure  him  that\r\n\r\nthere  are people in my constituency in Tanglin who  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  light  and water too. There are  many  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies which do not have these basic amenities.\r\n\r\nBut  does  it mean that we cannot build a fountain?  We\r\n\r\nhave  built  so  many  flats in Singapore  and  we  are\r\n\r\nbuilding  more. We have spent hundreds of  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  providing  housing. If I were  to  accept  his\r\n\r\nargument,  it  means that until we  house  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  no  fountain  should  be  erected.  But   a\r\n\r\nfountain is a thing of beauty, and all he has to do  is\r\n\r\nto visit the three fountains, the giant fountains which\r\n\r\nhave  been recently erected. I have not heard one  word\r\n\r\nof  criticism. The only words I have heard are words of\r\n\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mount Faber, he grumbles about providing\r\n\r\nlights. When we do not provide the lights, he grumbles.\r\n\r\nWhen  we provide the lights, he grumbles too. I believe\r\n\r\nhe  is  the only bachelor in the House.

I think  the\r\n\r\nMinister is a little unfair when he says that even when\r\n\r\nwe  provide lights, the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  does\r\n\r\nnot like it, and when we do not provide lights, he also\r\n\r\ndoes  not  like it. I think that is not  the  point  of\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of  the  Member. He  simply  said  that  the\r\n\r\n$30,000  which the Government wants to make use  of  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  MacRitchie Reservoir, could be better utilised\r\n\r\nto  develop the rural areas or places mostly  populated\r\n\r\nby poor people who are in need of amenities. I remember\r\n\r\nat  our  last sitting the Member for Delta also  shared\r\n\r\nthe same feeling that whenever a fountain is built,  it\r\n\r\nis  built  in the bourgeois area, say, in a place  like\r\n\r\nTanglin  which is well provided. There is no  necessity\r\n\r\nat all to build another fountain. That is all, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  various speakers  have  spoken  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion before the House. I would also like to express\r\n\r\nmy views and my feelings. I feel that this amount to be\r\n\r\nvoted  for  actually exceeds what the  Government  have\r\n\r\nallocated  for the Urban and Rural Services  Committee,\r\n\r\nand  exceeds  the Committee's approval to be  spent  on\r\n\r\nRedhill, because the total expenditure on Redhill  does\r\n\r\nnot exceed $30,000. Since the expenditure on building a\r\n\r\ncar park, attap shelters, garden seats and other things\r\n\r\nat  MacRitchie  Reservoir  exceeds  the  sum  spent  on\r\n\r\nRedhill  to provide basic facilities for the  residents\r\n\r\nthere,  most of the poor people there may have  adverse\r\n\r\nreactions to this sort of measure. As to the  car  park\r\n\r\nto be provided in MacRitchie Reservoir. I myself do not\r\n\r\nhave a car, so I will not be making full use of the car\r\n\r\npark. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Redhill there are many people who are still  having\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  their livelihood and  they  have  not\r\n\r\nreached a decent standard in their livelihood. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  better to promote and raise the living standard\r\n\r\nof   the   people   in   my  constituency   and   other\r\n\r\nconstituencies  than  spend more  money  on  the  areas\r\n\r\nalready  developed. What we want is something  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe urgent needs and not to add more to what is already\r\n\r\nthere. In other words, what we want is to have coal  in\r\n\r\nwinter  rather  than add more flowers to  a  bloom.  In\r\n\r\nRedhill  and  other places we need further development.\r\n\r\nIf sums are allocated for such development and when the\r\n\r\nliving   standard  of  the  residents  in  the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies can be raised by the vote, then  I  will\r\n\r\nbe  glad  to  see the Minister allocate  more  sums  to\r\n\r\nbeautify parks and the scenery at certain places, or to\r\n\r\nplace certain singing birds in certain areas, including\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas. I have no objection then. But,  first\r\n\r\nof  all,  we must try to raise the living standard  and\r\n\r\nprovide  basic living amenities to these people  before\r\n\r\nwe  vote  for  something to be spent on  areas  already\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  I can say that this kind of action  is  not\r\n\r\n100  per cent socialist. The building of a car park and\r\n\r\nthe  planting of flowers in a public park -  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand whether all this has anything to do with our\r\n\r\nsocialist principles. What we should be concerned  with\r\n\r\nis  how  to  raise the living standard of the  poor  to\r\n\r\nmatch  that of the rich. We should not allow  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  to  be  poorer and the rich to  become  richer.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a strong contrast between the poor  and  the\r\n\r\nrich. If we enhance this difference, then I will not be\r\n\r\nhappy to see it. There are millions of birds perched on\r\n\r\ntrees  singing all day long, but they would not  please\r\n\r\nme.

I propose to give you the history of these\r\n\r\nfountains.   The  question  of  fountains  at   traffic\r\n\r\ncircuses  was first raised by the Prime Minister  in  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  dated  the 7th of November,  1963,  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development. At that moment,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I was happily seated in your Chair. The Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department was then requested to draw up a  list\r\n\r\nof  likely sites where fountains could be put  up.  The\r\n\r\nfollowing  sites were submitted: Orchard  Road  Circus,\r\n\r\nRaffles  Place, King George V Park, Guillemard  Circus,\r\n\r\nthe  roundabout  at Farrer and Holland  Roads,  Tanglin\r\n\r\nCircus, Empress Place and Finlayson Green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all in 1963. Sketch plans and estimates of\r\n\r\ncosts   of   these  fountains  were  approved   by   my\r\n\r\npredecessor,    the   then   Minister   for    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, and submitted to the Development  Planning\r\n\r\nCommittee  for approval on the 2nd of June,  1964.  The\r\n\r\nplans  were  to  build  small fountains  costing  about\r\n\r\n$35,000  each  at these eight sites. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  - and I do not mean Mr Lim Kim San; that  was\r\n\r\nDr  Goh Keng Swee - in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Planning Committee, disapproved of the list\r\n\r\nsubmitted and commented - \"Better to have two or  three\r\n\r\nlavish  fountains than a large number of scraggy ones.\"\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, the Scientific Adviser was requested  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  discussion with the Deputy Director of  Public\r\n\r\nWorks, the Chief Planner and the Chief Architect on the\r\n\r\nfinal plans regarding sites and sizes for some prestige\r\n\r\nfountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting held on 16th October, 1964, at the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office,  fresh plans for  bigger  fountains\r\n\r\nwere considered and it was decided to proceed with  the\r\n\r\nthree fountains at the three sites just mentioned. That\r\n\r\nwas  the  16th  of October, 1964. I was  appointed  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law on the 1st of November, 1964.  I  was\r\n\r\nstill  then Speaker of this House.

This was appropriate\r\n\r\nwhen  all  sweepstakes were organised  for  the  direct\r\n\r\nbenefit  of racing clubs or associations. But  where  a\r\n\r\nsweepstake is organised for the purpose of raising much\r\n\r\nneeded  money for approved public welfare  projects  of\r\n\r\none  kind  or another, the old provisions are  obsolete\r\n\r\nand  it  becomes  necessary  to  provide  discretionary\r\n\r\npowers  to enable sweepstakes to be exempted from  duty\r\n\r\nso  that  the proceeds may be applied directly  to  the\r\n\r\napproved objects of the Sweep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Mr Speaker, Sir, I may say that owing\r\n\r\nto  the  increasing demand for funds to finance welfare\r\n\r\nand  other  charitable organisations in the State,  the\r\n\r\npossibilities of a Public Welfare Lottery were explored\r\n\r\nas  long  ago  as November 1965. The growing  needs  of\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare bodies in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  stressed  by  the  Singapore  Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService  in a letter to the Minister for Social Affairs\r\n\r\ndated  April 6, 1966, which expressed support  for  any\r\n\r\nmove  to set up a Public Welfare Lottery. Subsequently,\r\n\r\nit  was agreed that the Singapore Turf Club may  run  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sweep  in place of one of the  Club's  usual\r\n\r\nunlimited sweeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements are under consideration to ensure that\r\n\r\nall funds will be utilised for public projects, such as\r\n\r\na  national  stadium or for welfare purposes,  and  the\r\n\r\nexemption now provided by way of clause 2 of this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  enable  this to be done. But powers are  provided\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister not only to exercise discretion  but\r\n\r\nalso to impose such conditions as may be deemed fit  to\r\n\r\nensure  that exemptions are applied in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nproper purposes only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of constitutional changes, the opportunity is\r\n\r\nalso  taken in clause 3 (a) to delete the reference  to\r\n\r\n\"the  Colony\"  in  section  3  of  the  Ordinance   and\r\n\r\nsubstitute it by the word \"Singapore\", whilst clause  3\r\n\r\n(b)  provides  for the transfer of the power  to  grant\r\n\r\nextensions of time for the payment of duty - an act  of\r\n\r\nan  administrative  nature -  to  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nStamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 4 of the Bill makes unpaid duty a debt\r\n\r\ndue  to the Government of the Republic of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nconformity  with the other duties collected  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of other revenue laws in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\nastonished  to  know  that  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nintends  to  introduce this Bill on  a  Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency.

This method of a Government-sponsored lottery,\r\n\r\neven though it is for a praiseworthy cause, is a rather\r\n\r\ncontroversial topic. I am not speaking here only as the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of the N.T.U.C.,  but  also  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah Constituency. You may be aware of\r\n\r\nthe  view  of the N.T.U.C. in relation to any  form  of\r\n\r\ngambling,  that it does not, in principle, support  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  the  Government  of  Singapore  sponsoring  a\r\n\r\nlottery.  As  you  may also be aware, I  have  recently\r\n\r\nconducted  a  series  of house-to-house  visits  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency. In the course of such visits, I have been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  understand  by a substantial  number  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents  that  they are not very  happy  over  the\r\n\r\nquestion of Government sponsoring a lottery. What  will\r\n\r\nhappen  is this. On the day of the drawing of this  so-called welfare lottery, you will -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

It is the raising of\r\n\r\nfunds by means of a lottery. We are all aware that only\r\n\r\nthe  poor  people will contribute towards buying  these\r\n\r\nlottery  tickets,  and you will  find  that  20,000  to\r\n\r\n30,000  housewives will buy lottery  tickets  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  curtail their expenditure on marketing and  food.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is this, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. When the husband comes home, he will find\r\n\r\nthat  variety in the food on the table is missing,  and\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  Sweep ticket, instead of assisting  the\r\n\r\npoor,  I  am afraid is going to bring about unhappiness\r\n\r\nin all the families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree that if you take\r\n\r\nmoney from the rich and give it to the poor, that is  a\r\n\r\ncredit. But here, we are taking money from the poor and\r\n\r\ngiving  it  to the poor. I do not see any  credit.  But\r\n\r\nsome  of  you  may  take the cynical  view  that  I  am\r\n\r\ncriticising for the sake of opposing. This is  not  so.\r\n\r\nBecause  it is the man who has interests in  the  Party\r\n\r\nwill  only  criticise. A number of my constituents  who\r\n\r\nare unhappy and who object to the Government sponsoring\r\n\r\na  lottery  may  be misunderstood that  they  are  only\r\n\r\nvoicing their apprehension in order to defend their own\r\n\r\nillegal livelihood. But before any of you come  to  the\r\n\r\nwrong conclusion that such persons are objecting to the\r\n\r\nidea  of  the Government sponsoring a lottery  with  an\r\n\r\nulterior motive, I wish to impress upon you that  these\r\n\r\npersons  are  responsible and respectable citizens  who\r\n\r\nare  engaged  in making an honest living and  are  also\r\n\r\nmembers of civic organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for these reasons that I am of the firm opinion\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill relating to the proposed Social Welfare\r\n\r\nLottery,  or whatever name it may be called, should  be\r\n\r\nexposed  to  a  thorough public debate, but  not  on  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency as if we are facing an immediate\r\n\r\ninvasion  from  our neighbours. And one  way  to  gauge\r\n\r\npublic feeling on this matter of the Government sponsor\r\n\r\ning  a lottery is to let the Bill be dealt with by this\r\n\r\nHouse in the normal manner. By introducing such a  Bill\r\n\r\non  a  Certificate  of Urgency, the Government  is,  in\r\n\r\neffect,   preventing  Members  in   this   House   from\r\n\r\ndischarging  their  obligations  to  their   respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies. It is impossible for them to  ascertain\r\n\r\nthe  feelings of their constituents towards the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Lottery Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir ----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThis is not a Social Welfare Lottery Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  say  this  with  confidence  because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  subscribes to the practice and doctrine  of\r\n\r\nsocialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the essence of democratic socialism\r\n\r\nis  that there should be, as far as possible, an  equal\r\n\r\ndistribution  of wealth, and one way of achieving  such\r\n\r\nan  equal  distribution is by minimising  the  possible\r\n\r\nrange  of  income. In this society where  a  person  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to  enjoy an unearned income, that is,  income\r\n\r\nfrom a lottery which is not given to him because of his\r\n\r\nwork or occupation but because of the windfall from the\r\n\r\nlottery  there  is  a basic contradiction  between  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  sponsoring a lottery to  raise  funds  for\r\n\r\nsocial  objectives  and the concept  of  promoting  any\r\n\r\nmeasure that would enable a person to enjoy an unearned\r\n\r\nincome.  In Singapore as it is, we have quite a  number\r\n\r\nof  lotteries  and games of chance where  a  person  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the means to obtain such an unearned income.  We\r\n\r\nhave,  for  example,  horse racing,  the  illegal  four\r\n\r\ndigits,  the  Chap  Ji Kee. And I know  that  the  only\r\n\r\nargument that the Minister for Finance can put is, \"Oh,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  cannot stamp this out, we  cannot  control\r\n\r\nthis  illegal gambling, so we must make it legal.\" That\r\n\r\nwould be the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> He is putting words in my mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> He will say it is because\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  go to Johore to buy lottery  tickets.

Mr Speaker, Sir, if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wishes to legislate on the proposed  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Lottery, it would appear that its objection  to\r\n\r\nthe   running   of  an  illegal  lottery   by   private\r\n\r\nindividuals  or  syndicates is based  not  so  much  on\r\n\r\nprinciple as on the fact that it is deprived of certain\r\n\r\nrevenues,  in which case it is inconsistent for  it  to\r\n\r\ntreat  those  persons  who  are  convicted  of  running\r\n\r\nillegal  lotteries  and games of chance  as  criminals,\r\n\r\nbecause  their offence is not the crime  of  running  a\r\n\r\nlottery  or  games  of chance but the withholding  from\r\n\r\nGovernment   of  certain  revenues  which   they   have\r\n\r\ncollected  as  profit.  If  the  Government  deems   it\r\n\r\nnecessary to issue a Certificate of Urgency in  respect\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  on the proposed Social Welfare  Lottery,\r\n\r\nthen  it  should make it a matter of urgency to  remove\r\n\r\nthe  offence of running illegal lotteries or  games  of\r\n\r\nchance  from  the  Criminal Ordinance  or  the  Revenue\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the more I think of this, the more I\r\n\r\ncome  to the conclusion that the Government has  issued\r\n\r\nthis  Certificate of Urgency because it  realises  that\r\n\r\nthe proposed Social Welfare Lottery will be a financial\r\n\r\nsuccess. But I will say this - and I will prove  it  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance - that there will be 20,000 to\r\n\r\n30,000  unhappy families on the day of the  drawing.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  given to understand that the million-dollar\r\n\r\nsweepstake lottery organised by the Singapore Turf Club\r\n\r\nhas  met with a response exceeding the expectations  of\r\n\r\nthe organisers. I am quite sure that the Government has\r\n\r\nissued this Certificate of Urgency in order to cash  in\r\n\r\non the bonanza. While it is praiseworthy for it to find\r\n\r\nall means of obtaining more revenue, I think there is a\r\n\r\nlimit to which a responsible government, especially one\r\n\r\nwhich subscribes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  principle of socialism, can afford to  promote\r\n\r\ngambling  in order to bring in more revenue. I  am  not\r\n\r\nobjecting  to  this  proposed  Bill  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nobjecting,  but  a  lottery,  while  giving   rise   to\r\n\r\nexpectations of a sudden windfall, may in the end leave\r\n\r\nthe  poor poorer and the rich richer, because a lottery\r\n\r\nis  a game of chance, and the more tickets you buy  the\r\n\r\ngreater  are  the chances of winning the  jackpot.  The\r\n\r\npoor may strain their meagre resources, like the public\r\n\r\ndaily-rated employees to whom the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  refused to give even one cent. They may be tempted\r\n\r\nto buy and you make them poorer. So the poor may strain\r\n\r\ntheir  meagre  resources  to buy  for  themselves  such\r\n\r\nchances  as  are possible of winning the  jackpot,  but\r\n\r\nthey will not be able to compete with the rich who  are\r\n\r\nin  a position to buy many more chances of winning  the\r\n\r\njackpot  and  who, furthermore, are in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nafford  it. Because of all the considerations  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned,  I strongly oppose the  discussion  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill by this House on a Certificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to express my views on this Bill. Just now I\r\n\r\nhave  listened to the Member for Bras Basah's views  on\r\n\r\nit. He says that a lottery is contrary to the principle\r\n\r\nof  democratic socialism, and that the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will  cause a lot of  unhappiness  to  many\r\n\r\nfamilies.  But  I  am  of the view  that  it  will  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  bring  about  this  unhappiness.  If   the\r\n\r\nMember's  reasoning  could  hold  water,  then  I  will\r\n\r\nenumerate  two facts to counter his arguments.  Do  you\r\n\r\nremember  that  nine years ago when  Singapore  was  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  there was the Social Welfare Lottery? Even  now\r\n\r\nthere is the running of a Social Welfare Lottery.  Many\r\n\r\npeople  even go to Johore Bahru to buy lottery tickets.\r\n\r\nThese  people go over there to buy tickets  because  of\r\n\r\neconomic  reasons. Some buy only two or three  tickets.\r\n\r\nThis   will  not  be  seriously  detrimental  to  their\r\n\r\neconomic situation. If they are lucky enough, they  may\r\n\r\nget  some prizes which may help increase their  income.\r\n\r\nIt may help them economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we know that for several years\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  horse-racing. If the  Member  for  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah argues that horse-racing causes many families  to\r\n\r\nbe  unhappy, then, according to his calculations, there\r\n\r\nwill be many hundreds and thousands of families who are\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy. But, on the other hand, we see Singapore\r\n\r\ndeveloping  all  the time. According to  a  World  Bank\r\n\r\nReport,  the  standard of living of  Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\nthird highest in the whole of Asia. Whether or not  the\r\n\r\nissue  of lottery tickets is contrary to the tenets  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialism, I will say  this  that  in  many\r\n\r\nsocialist  countries  there is  also  the  practice  of\r\n\r\nrunning lotteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard the Minister say just now that the\r\n\r\nproceeds  from this lottery will be devoted  to  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  and charitable organisations. It is  meant  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  public  as a whole. A  dollar  from  each\r\n\r\nperson  will  accumulate into a large sum,  which  will\r\n\r\nhelp  our development and assist in the work of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare.  It is because of this that I am  not  of  the\r\n\r\nview that running a lottery will be detrimental to  the\r\n\r\nnation,  or to the economy or livelihood of the people.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary,  it will contribute  to  the  social\r\n\r\nwelfare work of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to express my views on this Bill.  I  agree\r\n\r\nvery  much with the sentiments expressed by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras Basah. At the same time, I beg to differ from\r\n\r\nwhat  the Member for Sembawang has said, and make  some\r\n\r\ncriticisms of his speech. Our Government is a socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment. We understand what is the final  aim  of  a\r\n\r\nsocialist government; that is, to give to each his  due\r\n\r\nand  to  extract from each his ability. If you get  one\r\n\r\ndollar from each man so that in the end the money comes\r\n\r\nto  fifty  or  five million dollars, then  it  will  be\r\n\r\ncontrary to the policy of our socialist Government.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  to misunderstand our principles. So  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Bras Basah that this Bill should be\r\n\r\ndebated by the public before it can he introduced  into\r\n\r\nthis House,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on\r\n\r\nthe  question of lotteries and sweepstakes, I have some\r\n\r\nviews  of  my  own.  I would also like  to  express  my\r\n\r\ndisagreement  with  certain  statements  of  a  certain\r\n\r\nMember  here.  The  Minister  has  given  reasons   and\r\n\r\nexplanations  which  are not entirely  satisfactory  or\r\n\r\nsufficient.  Recently  we  have  heard  some  Ministers\r\n\r\nsaying  that  wages  should be in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of the person concerned. In other  words,\r\n\r\nit  should  be measured according to a person's  effort\r\n\r\nand  performance, and this seems to be contrary to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  this  Bill. If the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nclarify the situation further, then the public will  be\r\n\r\nled to think that the Ministers are inconsistent, and I\r\n\r\nfeel this is regrettable. So I hope some Ministers  can\r\n\r\ngive  explanations to enlighten us all. In view of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister's inadequate explanation, and also  in\r\n\r\nview  of Members' arguments just now, there has been  a\r\n\r\ncertain  psychological reaction to this  Bill.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the idea of getting some benefit out of a lottery\r\n\r\nis  the normal thinking of any ordinary person.  If  we\r\n\r\ncan   be  more  practical  in  the  analysis  of  human\r\n\r\npsychology,  then we can understand that the  urge  and\r\n\r\ndesire to get a windfall through buying lottery tickets\r\n\r\nis  a  kind  of  economic as well  as  a  psychological\r\n\r\nmanifestation.  A windfall can be got  through  various\r\n\r\nillegal  or  criminal  methods,  such  as  robbery   or\r\n\r\nstealing  or smuggling. Through such methods,  one  can\r\n\r\novernight  get some unjust windfall. That is practical.\r\n\r\nIt  is  more  easily put into practice than  running  a\r\n\r\nlottery.  But if you say that it is fair  and  just  on\r\n\r\nsocialist  grounds that a person can get a windfall  by\r\n\r\nstriking a lottery, then I do not quite understand  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  \"windfall\" because from the standpoint  of\r\n\r\nsocialism,    we   feel   that   there   are    certain\r\n\r\ncontradictions  and discrepancies there.  We  see  that\r\n\r\nnowadays  it  is  difficult to voice  our  thoughts  on\r\n\r\nsocialism, namely, from each according to his  ability,\r\n\r\nand  to  each  according to his need. In the  situation\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore,  most of our people  have  regular\r\n\r\nemployment. The Member for Bras Basah has said that the\r\n\r\nhousewives have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  after their households, and the breadwinners  are\r\n\r\nthe  husbands or some other members of the  family.  If\r\n\r\nthese  breadwinners have no means of sustenance, or  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  depend on their employment but  on  some\r\n\r\nwindfall  to  look  after their families,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nunwise  to  spend  too much money on lotteries  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  adopt measures appropriate to deal  with  these\r\n\r\ncases.  But  if people who are regularly employed  look\r\n\r\nfor  an  opportunity  to  get a windfall  through  some\r\n\r\nunjust or shameful or illegal or criminal methods, then\r\n\r\nI say this is contrary to the normal means of earning a\r\n\r\nliving.  Also  it  cannot be  100  per  cent  sound  or\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  support the running of sweepstakes.  We\r\n\r\nmust  urge  that  our  socialist  policies  should   be\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Singapore cannot be isolated  from  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  We cannot build a wall around  it  so  that\r\n\r\nother  countries cannot get our people's money to spend\r\n\r\non  their lotteries. But, on the other hand, if we  can\r\n\r\nrun  our  own  lottery, of course, it will prevent  our\r\n\r\npeople's   money   from  being   drained   into   other\r\n\r\nterritories.  The Member for Bras Basah has  said  that\r\n\r\nthe  rich  get  the money from the poor by  striking  a\r\n\r\nlottery,  and  then they spend it on  the  poor  again.\r\n\r\nThat, I think, is difficult to understand. Is it really\r\n\r\njustifiable  to get money from the poor  and  spend  it\r\n\r\nback  on the poor? I do not quite see his argument.  We\r\n\r\nare used to hearing very often the name of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nin  his  talks. I do not understand what is his purpose\r\n\r\nin saying this. Is he trying to enhance his prestige by\r\n\r\ncalling on the name of the N.T.U.C.? Whether it  is  of\r\n\r\nany  use  in  doing this in this House I do  not  quite\r\n\r\nknow. It will have to depend on the Speaker to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is intended that some poor people in Singapore\r\n\r\ncan overnight become millionaires -- but the chances of\r\n\r\nthis  happening are very remote, only one  out  of  one\r\n\r\nmillion,  and this is perhaps also not in keeping  with\r\n\r\nsocialist  principles  - we can  perhaps  increase  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  prizes by reducing the amount of the  first\r\n\r\nprize to, say, $100,000. Perhaps this will provide more\r\n\r\nopportunities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor more people to get rich, and therefore it may be  a\r\n\r\nbit fairer. But in the past, from the point of law,  if\r\n\r\npeople ran illegal lotteries and they were caught, they\r\n\r\nwould  have to suffer the consequences. From the  point\r\n\r\nof  law,  in the past, there was no practice to  regard\r\n\r\nthe  winning  of  a lottery as a criminal  act  if  the\r\n\r\npractice  was  allowable under the law.  So  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncredit  or  discredit the issue of lottery tickets.  In\r\n\r\nprinciple, we may support this Bill, hut what  we  hope\r\n\r\nis   that   in  practice  there  should  be   necessary\r\n\r\narrangements  to  ensure that  the  lottery  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   will   not   have  any   undesirable   evil\r\n\r\nconsequences or any disadvantages which will make  many\r\n\r\npeople  change their correct concept of  life  or  lead\r\n\r\nthem  to believe that we are indulging in gambling.  So\r\n\r\nthis  is  what the Government should pay attention  to.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what I hope the Government can do. Finally  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  the Minister concerned to clarify  what  I\r\n\r\nhave asked him to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand\r\n\r\nnot  to  support this Bill because we know that betting\r\n\r\nand  sweepstakes  is a social evil, no  matter  whether\r\n\r\nsuch   betting  is  done  by  an  organised   club   or\r\n\r\nassociation  or an individual, or whether  it  has  the\r\n\r\nblessing  of  Government. For a  democratic  government\r\n\r\ndedicated to socialist principles to have the  idea  of\r\n\r\nrunning  a  sweepstake or lottery for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nraising funds is very much deplorable. We have a stable\r\n\r\ngovernment and an able Minister for Finance  who  knows\r\n\r\nways  and means of how to squeeze money in the  way  of\r\n\r\ntaxes  from  the general public. Yet the idea  to  have\r\n\r\nsome  extra measures of free betting and sweepstake  to\r\n\r\nfind  more money will mean that he is trying  to  sneak\r\n\r\nthrough  the  backdoor and induce  poor  housewives  to\r\n\r\nspend more money, and lately day-dreamers to find extra\r\n\r\nmoney  from  their  already  over-burdened  budget  and\r\n\r\neventually  making  them  poor.  We  believe   in   the\r\n\r\nsocialist principle of making men equal to one  another\r\n\r\neconomically, but not in making the poor poorer and the\r\n\r\nrich  richer. When our neighbouring country was running\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Lottery, the buying and selling  of\r\n\r\nthese lottery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntickets  was  banned in Singapore on the  grounds  that\r\n\r\nthis breeds evil. I wonder how, all of a sudden, the so\r\n\r\ndedicated  socialist government of Singapore found  fit\r\n\r\nto  introduce this free betting and sweepstake to  find\r\n\r\nmoney  for  social  welfare  purposes.  I  hope  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are trying to make hard-working, law-abiding\r\n\r\nand  good  citizens of our people and not more gamblers\r\n\r\nand   bookmakers,  as  I  feel  this   amendment   will\r\n\r\neventually bring about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  has two basic objections to this Bill: (1)  that\r\n\r\nit is being introduced on a Certificate of Urgency; and\r\n\r\n(2)  because he says it is a betting Bill. I can assure\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  the  Government is  well  aware  that\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is no Opposition in  the  House  -  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis having resigned or attempted to resign\r\n\r\nfrom  their  seats  and having been derelict  in  their\r\n\r\nduties - we must be very careful not to introduce Bills\r\n\r\nif  we can on Certificates of Urgency. For instance, if\r\n\r\nwe  were to introduce the Land Acquisition Bill or  any\r\n\r\nBill  on  the Constitution on a Certificate of Urgency,\r\n\r\nthat  would be most reprehensible. But we have not done\r\n\r\nthat. When important Bills come up, because there is no\r\n\r\nOpposition, we send them to Select Committee,  so  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public will have  an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\npresent their views and the Committee an opportunity to\r\n\r\nconsider  them. This is what has happened to  the  Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition Bill which will be read a Third time today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Betting and Sweepstake Duties (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  is  not a Bill to introduce betting in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf we have no horse-racing and no sweepstakes, and this\r\n\r\nis  a Bill to introduce gambling for the first time  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then we will never do it this way.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe  Members who object to this Bill read it carefully,\r\n\r\nthey  will note that it is a Bill to give the  Minister\r\n\r\npowers  to  exempt any sweepstake promoted,  organised,\r\n\r\nadministered  or  operated  by  any  racing   club   or\r\n\r\nassociation from all or any of the provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  It  does  not give him  power  to  start  a\r\n\r\nsweepstake. We have those powers and we have  had  them\r\n\r\nfor many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  year.  All  this Bill does is to give him  power  to\r\n\r\nexempt \"The Singapore Sweepstake\" - if you like to call\r\n\r\nit that - from paying 30 per cent tax that should go to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government. And I  cannot  see  why  we\r\n\r\ncannot  bring  it in on a Certificate of  Urgency.  The\r\n\r\ntickets are, at the moment, being sold in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  first  draw will be held in early December.  Hence\r\n\r\nthe urgency for this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party came to power in 1959,\r\n\r\nit  was  a  puritanical Party. It appears to me,  after\r\n\r\nhearing  some of our Members today, that we  are  still\r\n\r\nsemi-puritanical. There was a day when rock-n-roll  was\r\n\r\nbanned  in Singapore. I myself like rock-n-roll  and  I\r\n\r\nsaw no objections to rock-n-roll. Today, our youngsters\r\n\r\nlike  to  do  the Twist. I do it once in a  while,  but\r\n\r\nperhaps I am getting too old for it. But I think  there\r\n\r\nis  a new thinking now. We have to cater for our youths\r\n\r\nand every year there are 90,000 to 100,000 more voters,\r\n\r\nand we have to cater for their taste. And if our youths\r\n\r\nlike to do the Twist, I say good luck to them. The days\r\n\r\nof  the  pigtailed school-girls are over,  and  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis depend on them, I think they have  not\r\n\r\ngot  a hope.

If\r\n\r\nit  was  my  intention to introduce, allow or encourage\r\n\r\ngambling  through the back-door, I would not have  made\r\n\r\nany  amendment to the Ordinance at all, because I would\r\n\r\nbe  able to get money simply by telling the Turf  Club,\r\n\r\n\"All  right,  you run it, pay the tax and give  us  the\r\n\r\nprofits.\" That would be an easier way of doing it than\r\n\r\nby  coming here and seeking approval for this amendment\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if I can be assured that if we do not allow\r\n\r\nthe  Turf Club to run this sweep and the population  at\r\n\r\nlarge  would not spend their money on gambling, then  I\r\n\r\nwould  agree  that we stop gambling here entirely.  But\r\n\r\nhuman  nature  is  such that even if we  do  not  allow\r\n\r\ngambling,  a  large amount of money will  be  spent  on\r\n\r\ngambling  -  and illegal gambling at that - which  will\r\n\r\nencourage gangsterism, protection rackets and all sorts\r\n\r\nof crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> What are the police doing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I see that our friend is back here!\r\n\r\nThe  police have not only to look out for gambling  but\r\n\r\nthey have also other jobs to do.

I think the Member  for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\ncontradicts  himself when he says that the chances  for\r\n\r\nthe  poor  are  less for the simple  reason  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  buy more lottery tickets  than  the\r\n\r\nrich.

So the\r\n\r\nchances  of a rich man winning a lottery are a  hundred\r\n\r\ntimes more than those of a poor man.

The  Malaya  British  Borneo\r\n\r\nCurrency Agreement, 1960, signed by the Governments  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Malaya and Brunei, established the Board  of\r\n\r\nCommissioners  of Currency, Malaya and British  Borneo,\r\n\r\nas   the  sole  currency  issuing  authority  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective countries. Under the terms of this  Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement,  any  of the Participating  Governments  can\r\n\r\nreplace   the  Board  as  the  sole  currency   issuing\r\n\r\nauthority  by lodging a notice of its intention  to  do\r\n\r\nso,  18  months prior to the date it wishes to commence\r\n\r\nits  currency  issue. Such a notice of replacement  was\r\n\r\nlodged  by the Government of Malaysia on 12th December,\r\n\r\n1964. This notice, therefore, became effective on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12th  June,  1966,  that is, 18  months  after  it  was\r\n\r\nlodged,  and  the  Currency Board is  then  obliged  to\r\n\r\nrelinquish  its right to issue currency  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Brunei. There is, however, provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Agreement  for  the Board  to  continue  to  issue\r\n\r\ncurrency  for a further period of six months after  the\r\n\r\nnotice becomes effective, if it is requested to  do  so\r\n\r\nby  the  Participating Governments. Such a request  was\r\n\r\naccordingly made and the Board was therefore  empowered\r\n\r\nto  issue  currency  in the territories  of  the  three\r\n\r\nGovernments concerned up to 12th December, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participating Governments had also agreed that the\r\n\r\nlife  span of the Board should be extended by a further\r\n\r\nsix  months,  that is, up to 12th June,  1967.  As  the\r\n\r\nCurrency  Agreement does not provide for  such  further\r\n\r\nextension, it is necessary to amend this Agreement. The\r\n\r\npurpose of the Bill is, therefore, to give legal effect\r\n\r\nto  this  amendment so that the Board can  continue  to\r\n\r\nissue currency up to 12th June, 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill .-[Mr Ramaswamy}.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND ACQUISITION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Members will also recall that during the  Second\r\n\r\nReading,  I  expressed the hope that  when  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  calls  for  representations,  persons   with\r\n\r\npositive   contributions   will   come   forward   with\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  I  am, indeed, happy to report  that  the\r\n\r\nresponse  to invitations for representation  was  good.\r\n\r\nEleven  written representations were received  and  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee heard oral evidence from six of  them.\r\n\r\nSome of these contributions were valuable and many  sug\r\n\r\ngestions have been accepted. The Committee's Report was\r\n\r\npublished on 10th September, 1966, as Paper Parl. 9  of\r\n\r\n1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill as now tabled before the\r\n\r\nHouse  incorporates the recommendations of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I do not propose to burden the  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House with unnecessary explanations, but there are\r\n\r\ntwo  fundamental  provisions on which there  have  been\r\n\r\nrepresentations  which were unacceptable  and  which  I\r\n\r\nwish to take this opportunity to reiterate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these is the compensation provision in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. As has already been explained in this  House\r\n\r\npreviously, the principle underlining this provision is\r\n\r\nthat  no  landowner  should  benefit  at  the  public's\r\n\r\nexpense,   from  any  windfall  gains  resulting   from\r\n\r\nenhancement of land values either through Acts  of  God\r\n\r\nor  because of public expenditure in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMembers  are aware of the phenomenal increases in  land\r\n\r\nvalues  which result when heavily encumbered lands  are\r\n\r\ndevastated by fire. This fortuitous increase  in  value\r\n\r\nwill not now go to the landowner. Again, development by\r\n\r\nGovernment and public authorities in areas like Jurong,\r\n\r\nKallang  Basin  and Kranji has resulted  in  phenomenal\r\n\r\nincreases  in  land values in these neighbourhoods.  It\r\n\r\nwas  ironical that under the existing legislation, when\r\n\r\nadditional lands in these areas had to be acquired  for\r\n\r\npublic purposes, Government had to pay compensation  at\r\n\r\nvalues  which Government itself had helped to  enhance.\r\n\r\nThe  element of enhancement attributable in these cases\r\n\r\nto public participation (as opposed to participation by\r\n\r\nthe private sector), is the element which under the new\r\n\r\nBill  will  be  creamed off when land is  acquired  for\r\n\r\npublic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make today involves the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  the  Appeals Board. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of representations were received by the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  in  which the same point was made.  And  the\r\n\r\npoint  was this: all appeals should be heard by a Court\r\n\r\nof Law presided by a Judge of the High Court instead of\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals Board, as proposed. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nmove  to  take appeals away from the Courts  and  place\r\n\r\nthem in the hands of an Appeals Board or tribunal is in\r\n\r\nconformity with prevailing trends else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  in the world of entrusting matters of specialist\r\n\r\nevaluation  to  Administrative Tribunals where  persons\r\n\r\nwith  the  requisite  expertise can  deal  with  issues\r\n\r\ninvolving  subjects  with  which  they  are  themselves\r\n\r\nfamiliar. Furthermore, procedures before such tribunals\r\n\r\nare  less formal, less expensive, more expeditious and,\r\n\r\nperhaps, more satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the Appeals Board envisaged in the\r\n\r\nBill  is  similar to the set-up in the United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nbut   we  have  not  laid  down  statutory  limitations\r\n\r\nprescribing     minimum    legal    or     professional\r\n\r\nqualifications in order not to restrict  the  field  of\r\n\r\nselection.   It   is  envisaged,  however,   that   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, both of  whom\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  status of High Court Judges,  will  be\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  either  legally  qualified  or  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable  experience  in  land  administration  and\r\n\r\nother  matters. The panel of assessors will be  persons\r\n\r\nwith  objective minds who will be able  to  assist  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  in  assessing  fair  compensation   after\r\n\r\nlistening to expert evidence on values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  associate  myself  with  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Minister. Sir, as I see it, this is  a\r\n\r\npiece of legislation which definitely favours the  poor\r\n\r\nman.  This is what we the P.A.P. Government stands  for\r\n\r\n- for   the  poor  man.  Let  me  take  an  example   to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  my argument. A few years  ago  when  hell\r\n\r\nbroke  loose in the Bukit Ho Swee area where  thousands\r\n\r\nof  people were rendered homeless by fire, what did the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  do then? Did  the  Government  just\r\n\r\nmerely  say, \"Well, we will try to rehouse  them.\"  No,\r\n\r\nfar from it, not just trying in that direction. But the\r\n\r\nGovernment  took  immediate steps to provide  immediate\r\n\r\nrelief  to  the homeless. Then the Bukit Ho  Swee  fire\r\n\r\nsite was acquired and plans to put up decent flats with\r\n\r\nthe necessary social amenities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere drawn up and at once implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if there had not been any fire and had not the\r\n\r\nGovernment  acquired this site, today we will  not  see\r\n\r\nthe  beautiful symmetry of a clean and healthy location\r\n\r\nwhere numerous blocks of flats for the poor exist. I am\r\n\r\nsure  this House will agree whole-heartedly with me  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter. The Government, on the one hand, acquires\r\n\r\nland  for community use and those who think they  would\r\n\r\nsuffer  as a result should retune their minds and  look\r\n\r\nat  acquisition  as a means of allowing  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  provide the poor with  decent  homes  and\r\n\r\nbetter  social  amenities.  On  the  other  hand,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with the people's needs uppermost  in  its\r\n\r\nmind,  would  continue to fulfil its obligations,  come\r\n\r\nwhatever the obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that those affected are asking for more\r\n\r\ncompensation  than what is arrived at by  our  valuers.\r\n\r\nThey  should have been happy with what they are to get.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I  would say that the land value  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced to as low a rate as possible in order to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Government to continue to provide such  amenities.\r\n\r\nMay  I,  Sir, stress that we do not wish to favour  the\r\n\r\nland   speculators  who  jump  at  opportunities   when\r\n\r\nGovernment projects or public projects are carried  out\r\n\r\nin adjacent lands, thereby helping to boost up the land\r\n\r\nvalue! We come from the masses and our obligation is to\r\n\r\nthem and them alone. If we allow these speculators free\r\n\r\nrein, then chaos and financial difficulties would over-run  us all and the Government would then have to  dish\r\n\r\nout enormous sums of money to pay for fantastic sums of\r\n\r\ncompensation   to  those  involved.   I   think   those\r\n\r\nlandowners who are rich must be practical. They  should\r\n\r\nbe  the  first  to come forward and assist  in  nation-building  and make some sacrifices, for, as the  saying\r\n\r\ngoes,  Sir, \"It is in the giving that we receive.\"  Let\r\n\r\nme  ask  them a question. What would happen to them  if\r\n\r\nthe   country  goes  down?  Where  would  their  landed\r\n\r\nproperties  be  then? If they would  care  to  look  at\r\n\r\ncertain  countries not far from us, they would  see  my\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our main objective is to help establish a more\r\n\r\nequal and just society, therefore, our declared aim  is\r\n\r\nto  acquire  lands  from time to  time  which  will  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  or  utilised for public purposes,  say,  for\r\n\r\nexample, to build more schools, clinics, more blocks of\r\n\r\nhousing   flats,  more  community  centres,  veterinary\r\n\r\nextension centres and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I would urge those likely to be affected\r\n\r\nto  think well of others so that the declared  aims  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government  can  be  achieved  with   as   little\r\n\r\ninconvenience as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  this Bill. It is, on the whole, good  for  the\r\n\r\nlower strata of society. It is appropriate and in  line\r\n\r\nwith  our  new  status and new name,  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and consonant with the concept of democratic\r\n\r\nsocialism  which is strongly opposed by  the  Alliance,\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and other Parties whose aim is  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate  bourgeois rule. Why I say so, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  that lands which are acquired by Government will be\r\n\r\nfully  developed  for the purpose of  public  projects;\r\n\r\nclinics,  dispensaries, hospitals, schools, cheap  -  I\r\n\r\nemphasise   cheap  - flats,  not  high   rental   flats,\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and other projects  which  would  be\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the lower class society, not parks like  the\r\n\r\nMacRitchie  Reservoir  Park on which  we  have  debated\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government is not confiscating properties owned by\r\n\r\nlandowners,  Mr Speaker, Sir. Before  such  lands  are\r\n\r\nacquired  by  Government, they  will  be  assessed  and\r\n\r\nadequate  compensation will be paid, which is  not  the\r\n\r\ncase  in  Communist  countries.  In  other  words,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  both parties benefit. As has  happened,\r\n\r\nwhen a fire breaks out, it is the responsibility of the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of the day to rehouse the fire  victims  in\r\n\r\nflats  and offer relief. The landowner shakes his  legs\r\n\r\nand  when  the land is free of squatters, he  is  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  develop it for his own selfish  interest.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate  that this Bill, which will be approved  by\r\n\r\nParliament, will satisfy all parties concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nabout  this Land Acquisition Bill, we all may have  the\r\n\r\nimpression that this is one of the important  Bills  to\r\n\r\nbe passed by this Parliament. I would like to deal with\r\n\r\nthis Bill in a wider perspective. Inevitably, a country\r\n\r\nwill have certain laws and rights to the land. This  is\r\n\r\na necessary and an essential feature of the rights of a\r\n\r\ncountry.  And  in the development of a country,  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable that there are certain changes. When certain\r\n\r\ncountries  change from an agricultural  economy  to  an\r\n\r\nindustrialised  economy,  it is  necessary  to  acquire\r\n\r\nland.  This  is  called land reform. And  at  times  it\r\n\r\nhappens that this leads to a struggle for power between\r\n\r\nthe  landowners and the State. In countries  which  are\r\n\r\nfriendly  with  us, the Eastern European countries  and\r\n\r\nEgypt  -  I will just enumerate one example - in  Egypt\r\n\r\nthere  is  also the problem of landownership and  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  certain  harm done by the system  there.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  a policy on acquisition of land to meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirement of the country in its development.  To  our\r\n\r\nminds, the land is part and parcel of a country and  it\r\n\r\nis  the  right of the State to acquire and  manage  its\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our island is a very tiny one and with our limited\r\n\r\nland   area,  we  have  to  build  an  ideal   country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  must put our land to the best  possible\r\n\r\nuse  in  order to meet our largest and highest demands.\r\n\r\nWe  should have proper arrangements and measures in our\r\n\r\nisland State in order to ensure that every inch of land\r\n\r\ncan  be  put  to  the best possible  use  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  national  development  and  to  promote   the\r\n\r\nprosperity of our country, so that we can extract every\r\n\r\nbenefit out of every inch of land and so that every man\r\n\r\ncan  be used to the limit of his ability and everything\r\n\r\ncan be put to the best possible use. We should not have\r\n\r\nthe  practice  such  as  is  obtaining  in  feudalistic\r\n\r\ncountries, to divide or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallot   lands  to  certain  landlords.  But   here   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we should try to realise our own  paradise.\r\n\r\nWe  should not allow anybody to waste too large an area\r\n\r\nof  land. We do not have too many Christmas Islands  to\r\n\r\nbe  sold. Therefore, we must make the best possible use\r\n\r\nof our land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of Parliament and the general public\r\n\r\nregard the passage of this Bill as one of the important\r\n\r\nsteps  taken  in  the  process of  development  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  We  should  concentrate all  our  energy  and\r\n\r\nattention  on  the development of our country,  and  in\r\n\r\nthis   respect,  the  acquisition  of  land   is   very\r\n\r\nimportant.  It  is  a  very essential  feature  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of nation-building. We are short of land,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is a saying that God created the world  and  the\r\n\r\nDutch created land. We should also follow suit to  show\r\n\r\nthat we can also reclaim land from the sea in order  to\r\n\r\nextend  our  land area, which is part  of  our  nation-\r\n\r\nbuilding  process.  This is a step  forward  towards  a\r\n\r\nbetter future and the prosperity and development of our\r\n\r\ncountry.  This is an inevitable part of our endeavours.\r\n\r\nI  do not view this Bill as a piece of legislation  but\r\n\r\nas  a  dynamic  step forward in the right direction  of\r\n\r\nnation-building.  I  believe  that  after  the  law  is\r\n\r\namended,  it will already have its own proper  form  to\r\n\r\nmeet the requirements of the time. Therefore, it is now\r\n\r\ntabled in this House for discussion and passage. It has\r\n\r\nalready  been  considered in Select Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nReport  has been published. Advertisements appeared  in\r\n\r\nthe  Press  on  the  25th and 27th of  June  this  year\r\n\r\ninviting representations on the Bill. This is a show of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, and I am very satisfied with the process  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. It is also comprehensive in its structure and\r\n\r\ntakes  into  consideration every aspect of the  problem\r\n\r\narising  out  of  land acquisition. The acquisition  of\r\n\r\nland  is  not  always for perpetual possession  by  the\r\n\r\nState.  In some cases, land is to be put to use and  is\r\n\r\nrequired for a period of 3 years. Stress is put on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of land for public requirements and needs. Because\r\n\r\nof   this  feature,  the  Bill  has  brought  about   a\r\n\r\nsocialistic change in land acquisition. In a socialist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry, it is fit and proper that every inch  of  land\r\n\r\nshould  be  put to the best possible use to  yield  the\r\n\r\nbest advantage for the benefit of the people and make a\r\n\r\nvery  effective contribution to the development of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  This  is  a  very  essential  feature  of   a\r\n\r\nsocialistic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another characteristic of this Bill is that landowners\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to benefit from an increase  in  land\r\n\r\nvalue  by  receiving  a windfall, so  that  nobody  can\r\n\r\nspeculate in land value. This is also a good feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like this House to refer to page 18 of the\r\n\r\nBill. There is a provision that compensation should not\r\n\r\nalways   be  paid  according  to  market  value  before\r\n\r\nacquisition,  because there are so many  factors  which\r\n\r\ncontribute to an increase of land value - some of which\r\n\r\nare   illegal.  So  after  careful  consideration   and\r\n\r\ndeliberate study, the Bill is now in its best  possible\r\n\r\nform  and  it will not be detrimental to the people.  I\r\n\r\nhave  full confidence in it and I believe that when  it\r\n\r\nis  put into effect and practice, it will be beneficial\r\n\r\nto the people and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I express my support for the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There has not been a word of criticism.
