Last year, the passing rate for CL2, ML2 and TL2 at PSLE was around 97%. At 10, level, the corresponding passing rate was around 87%. Therefore, there is no decline in the interest or ability of our students to study the mother tongue in the vast majority of cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry has taken a number of steps to further improve the teaching of the mother tongue and to promote its use in our schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main improvement is in the new textbooks, audio visual materials and teaching methods which have been and are being developed by CDIS. Project teams have been formed for CL2, ML2 and TL2. For example, the teaching of CL2 in primary schools has been significantly improved by the use of the new CLIPS materials for primary schools. The CLIPS materials are a major departure from earlier materials. Apart from being more interesting, the materials also give greater emphasis to listening, speaking and reading skills in addition to writing skills. Studies by CDIS and the Institute of Education show that, on the whole, pupils taught with the CLIPS approach score about 12% higher than those taught by non-CLIPS methods. The CLIPS series has reached Primary 6 level this year. Similar projects are in progress for secondary CL2 materials and for the ML2 and TL2 courses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second language textbooks are not just grammar books. They also contain many stories taken from the classics which are intended to impart moral and cultural values. As much as 77% of their contents are on moral and cultural topics. To ensure that the language is relevant to daily life, the textbooks also contain topics related to social and economic aspects of life, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the use of the mother tongue, all moral education classes are taught in the mother tongue in the primary schools. At the secondary level, moral education classes are taught either in English or in the mother tongue. Recognizing that there is a shortage of supplementary reading materials in the mother tongue languages, CDIS as well as private publishers are producing a growing list of new titles. Schools have been encouraged to organize their own \"Speak Your School Languages\" campaigns, including the mother tongue. I can therefore assure the Member for Boon Teck that my Ministry is aware of the need and is making every effort to encourage the teaching and the use of the mother tongue in our schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CHINESE LANGUAGE 2 AT 'O' LEVEL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Standard of Pass grade)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Koh Lip Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Koh Lip Lin</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Education (a) what is the standard of a passing grade in Chinese Language 2 (CL2) at 'O' level and whether a student who has passed CL2 at 'O' level be able to read Chinese newspapers and general books and write reasonable Chinese; (b) what steps his Ministry has taken, with the introduction of a new national stream education system, to ensure that the quality of teaching and the standard of CL2 will not decline in future; (c) whether there is a minimum number of hours assigned to the teaching of CL2 in schools; and (d) whether his Ministry will consider replacing the names CL2, Malay Language 2 (ML2) and Tamil Language 2 (TL2) with CL, ML and TL, respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon (for the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I want to thank the Member for Nee Soon for raising specific questions concerning the teaching of CL2. This gives me the opportunity to clear some doubts which have arisen in the media concerning the standard of CL2. But before I answer his questions, I want to take this opportunity to clear up two misconceptions which have arisen since the recent announcement that by 1987, all our schools will be of the national type teaching ELl and mother tongue as second language. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first misconception is the belief by some that the mother tongue, especially Chinese, is now no longer important. This is not so. CL2 is important. The bilingual policy remains unchanged. CL2 will continue to be given due weightage at PSLE and 'O' level for progress into secondary and Pre-U levels. At the NUS, students who are admitted without the pre-requisite of D7 in CL2 will have to pass a Chinese proficiency examination before they are allowed to graduate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second misconception is that the termination of the Chinese medium stream by 1987 means that the future of Chinese language in Singapore is in doubt. This again is not so. The bilingual policy will ensure that Chinese is taught and learnt to the same level as it is today. Over the past decade, the majority of our school leavers have been through the bilingual system. Today, mote people than ever before are bilingual, especially the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> younger generation. Let me quote some statistics from the 1980 census. For those aged 40 and above, only 7% are literate and bilingual in English and Chinese. For those between 30 and 39 years of age, 19% are bilingual. For those between 15 and 29 years of age, 35% are bilingual. Between the 1970 and 1980 census, the total percentage of Singapore Chinese who are bilingual rose from 11.8% to 29.6%, an increase of 2,3-fold. Thus, the number who are bilingual is growing steadily each year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to the specific questions that the Member for Nee Soon has asked. A student who has completed CL2 at Sec 4 would have mastered about 3,000 characters. This should readily enable him to read the daily newspapers and general books, to discuss general topics in Chinese, and to write letters and short essays. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my reply to the Member for Boon Teck, my Ministry has taken a number of measures to ensure that the teaching of CL2 is improved. The standard of CL2 is carefully specified in the CL2 syllabus and in the new textbooks produced by CDIS. The syllabus prescribes a minimum of 3,000 characters and 200 idiomatic expressions that must be learnt by a student by the time he reaches Sec 4. The 'O' level CL2 examination is set and moderated by an independent panel from the Chinese Studies Department of NUS to ensure that the standard is maintained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of periods given to CL2 in primary and secondary levels is also prescribed. In primary schools, it is 8 to 10 periods per week depending on the level, while in secondary schools, it is 6 periods per week. Schools are, however, given some latitude to adjust the number of periods up or down by one period per week depending on the particular need of individual classes in the school. Thus, for example, many schools run extra remedial classes for their weak pupils. Extra Chinese language exposure time is also given to the pupils through subjects such as moral education and art and craft. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon has asked whether the suffix \"2\" could be dropped from CL2, ML2 and TL2.

Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me explain that the Government's policy is to promote the formation of house unions. This is because experience here and elsewhere has shown that house unions can contribute to better labour-management relations. Through house unions, the nexus between the company and workers can be better strengthened and workers will be better able to appreciate that their future and welfare are closely tied to the prosperity and viability of their company. It will also help employers to get to know union leaders better and thus be more willing to work with the union as a team. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, there are 14 house unions in the public sector and 15 in the private sector. Of these, eight were formed in the last three years when the Ministry and the NTUC first started to promote house unions. The concept of house unions is catching on with workers and there is greater awareness by both managements and unions of its positive attributes. In this regard, the progress in the establishment of house unions can be said to be satisfactory. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems encountered in the formation of house unions depend on the individual companies involved. Much depends on how the management and workers identify with each other and hence the level of their mutual trust. There must be a realization on the part of both management and workers that a house union will be in the collective interest. There must be available mature and responsible union leaders on the one hand and on the other hand care and concern for the workers must be shown by management. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to strongly promote the formation of house unions in view of the positive contribution they can make to the enhancement of productivity. I must, however, stress that the actual establishment of house unions must be left to the workers themselves and to some extent the management of the company. They must be convinced that the house union will serve their interest and objective of fostering closer relations within the company and thus contribute to its continued growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A supplementary question, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the Acting Minister. Will the Minister state whether the promotion of these house unions has been brought about for the benefit of the companies and the employers, or is it designed primarily for the benefit of the workers? Secondly, as I understood the Acting Minister, it is not being forced on the workers. Would the Minister say whether, in every case before a house union is promoted, a secret ballot is taken of the workers to find out whether they would rather have a house union instead of an industry or allied trade union? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has raised two questions. The first arises from his not having listened to the answer which I have just given and, that is, for whose benefit the house union is intended to promote. I took care to explain that the rationale of house unions is to precisely promote the benefit of workers as well as to promote the nexus between management and labour, which nexus will also bring about greater productivity, greater profits which in turn will be shared by the workers. And so the answer is clear - it benefits both the company and their management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question relates to the procedure of decision-making. The answer to that obviously must be that the decisions are taken in accordance with the rules and constitution of each union. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I again, Sir, with your permission, ask the Minister to give me a specific answer to a specific question, and that is, whether the willingness of the workers is determined by a secret ballot taken from the workers or not.

I have just said that the Government will strongly promote the formation of house unions. There has been no instance of anyone being forced to have a house union.

It is that kind of intimidation which exists in isolated cases with regard to which the Ministry of Labour will take a strong stand.

This is demonstrated by the presence here of a large number of financial institutions of international standing and reputation, the advent of new financial instruments, the rapid development of the Asian Dollar Market, the extensive nature of the financial transactions that are entered into and the numerous financial services that are now being provided. The liberalization of exchange controls and the development of the capital market have also played their part in making the banking scene in Singapore vastly different from what it was at the time of the passing of the Banking Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, 1981 to 1983, the contribution of the financial sector to our GNP was large, $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. Growth rates registered were 25.0%, 16.7% and 14.3%. These growth rates were exceeded only by Construction. As on June 1983, the industry employed 38,268 persons, mostly in well-paid occupations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, then, hardly surprising that these developments have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the existing Act to deal with the many changes that have occurred since 1971. Some of the concepts in the existing Act have to some extent become outdated, other concepts are in need of refinement to meet rapidly changing financial conditions. Thus the decision was taken to conduct a comprehensive review of the provisions of the existing Act to make it a more efficient and flexible instrument for regulating the industry in the long term interests of both the banks and their depositors and other creditors. It is against this background that the proposals in the Bill now before hon. Members should be viewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act provides for the organization, structuring, control and supervision of banks in general. The control and supervision of banks is, as Members know, the responsibility of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. It is well recognized that the supervision of banks is a difficult and often complex operation. Too lax a supervision can lead to abuse and fraud; too strict will stifle growth and enterprise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no perfect form of supervision, there must be a constant striving to make this form of control as effective as possible, without overdoing it. A wise Mandarin of the ancient Chinese Imperial Civil Service said that governing a country is like frying small fish. It must not be overdone. This dictum applies to bank supervision, for there are limits to what it can achieve. It cannot, of course, ensure that banks will not make loans or investments that turn out to be bad. The responsibility for making loans and investments must rest squarely on the heads of the directors of banks and that is why it is so important that directors should be persons of integrity and competence who exercise great care and skill in controlling their loans and investment business. A mere examination of returns of banks by the Authority can be no substitute for proper internal control by bank managements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these introductory comments, I will now deal with the main provisions in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals in the Bill, in general terms, will:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) improve supervisory powers of MAS over banks; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) ensure that control of domestic banks would not pass into undesirable hands; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) set limits of credit facilities that a bank may grant to its customers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) enable the Authority to have stricter control over the audit of banks; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v) rectify the anomaly in the provision for priority of deposit liabilities by giving deposit liabilities that have been subject to prudential requirements prior claim; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi) replace the existing administrative control over the operation of an Asian Currency Unit by statutory provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major group of amendments that are proposed in this Bill is concerned with the passing of control of domestic banks to other persons. These appear in clause 5 of the Bill which introduces new sections 14A, B, C and D. These amendments would enable the Authority in relation to a bank that is incorporated in Singapore to control - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) a take-over of such a bank by the intended acquisition of not less than 20% of its shares; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) arrangements by which outside persons would be able to determine the policy of such a bank; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the acquisition of substantial holdings, that is, interests in 5% of the voting shares of such a bank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that domestic banks, which form a key sector in the economy, should not pass into undesirable hands. The proposals do not prevent, it will be noted, a take-over by acquisition of shares or the acquisition of substantial holdings in domestic banks but they do seek to ensure that the Authority will be in a position to decide whether the potential new controller or substantive shareholder, as the case may be, is a suitable person to be exercising control or to be having a substantial shareholding in a domestic bank. The proposals will only apply to persons seeking to obtain control of or have substantial holdings in a domestic bank after \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the coming into force of this proposed legislation. They do not affect past changes of control or past acquisitions of substantial shareholdings. The provisions in new sections 14A and 14B that deal with potential changes of control of domestic banks are, it will be noted, widely drafted so as to embrace not only situations where a person is acting alone to obtain control but also where he is acting in concert with associates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment proposed by the new section 14D would enable the Authority to obtain from a bank that is incorporated in Singapore information as to the beneficial ownership of shares in that bank. This proposal is closely linked to the function of the Authority in exercising control over take-overs and substantial shareholders for it will enable the Authority to ascertain the ownership of shares held, for example, in nominee names and thus make it more difficult for persons to place themselves in a position so as to obtain control of a domestic bank through such nominees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of amendments is concerned with the need to ensure that banks in their lending or investment activities conduct their business in a prudential manner and thus avoid over-committing their financial resources. Accordingly, the amendment proposed to section 25 would have the following effect of:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) changing the existing limit in which a bank may grant credit facilities to a single customer or group of connected customers by lowering the aggregate percentage from an amount in excess of 60% of the capital funds of the bank to 30% of those funds; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) limiting substantial loans to an aggregate amount which does not exceed 50% of its total credit facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>A substantial loan means, in general terms, a credit facility granted to a single customer or group of connected customers which in the aggregate exceeds 15% of the bank's capital funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are designed to promote prudential banking and at the same time take into account that the capital bases of all the domestic banks have grown very substantially since the original 60% limit was fixed in 1971. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> total capital funds of domestic banks have increased more than 11 times, from S$325 million to S$3,849 million during the period 1971 to 1982. The lower limit of 30% should therefore not interfere with participation by banks in major loan projects or interfere with their competitiveness in their domestic and international business. The limitation on the granting of substantial loans is to ensure that banks do not concentrate their commitments too much by lending only to a few big customers and thus increasing their risk exposure. In other words, it discourages them from putting too many of their eggs in one basket. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 which introduces a new section 27A has much the same objective in mind. This provision, however, is designed to exercise a measure of control over banks which seek to diversify, for example, into commercial or industrial undertakings to an undesirable extent. Accordingly, it provides that banks shall not enter into agreements to acquire interests of 20% or more in any company, whether incorporated in Singapore or not, without the approval of the Authority. This provision would not apply, however, to a bank's acquisition of such assets in satisfaction of debts due to it so long as, upon making the acquisition, the bank obtains the approval of the Authority to retain these assets as an investment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the prudential limits of section 25 and other sections of the Act dealing, in particular, with the lending and investment activities of banks are not circumvented by the use of subsidiaries or related companies, the Authority may require a bank to aggregate its assets, liabilities or profits, as the case may be, with those of any of such subsidiaries or other related companies. This will enable the Authority to exercise prudential supervision on a group basis. This provision is in line with the practice in Switzerland, and the German bank regulators are contemplating a similar policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the amendments that are proposed to section 42 which provides for banking secrecy. These proposed amendments have been found by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> experience in administering the Act to be necessary to relieve the existing rigidity in section 42(3) which deals with the requirement of maintaining banking secrecy. In the main, they are intended to extend the existing exceptions to banking secrecy to cover civil proceedings arising between a bank and the guarantor of a customer or where the bank has been served with a garnishee order attaching monies in the account of a customer or where the information to be disclosed relates to credit facilities granted by a bank incorporated outside Singapore and the information is required by its head office for supervisory purposes. However, other amendments are intended to tighten up the existing exceptions to banking secrecy. The exception that enables a bank to give information about the credit worthiness of a customer has been restricted to the giving of information which is of a general character and not related to details of a customer's account. Again, the exception in section 42(4)(a) providing for a customer of a bank to give permission for disclosure of his bank affairs may be interpreted as meaning that the customer's oral permission is sufficient. The amendment will now make clear that he has to give his written permission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes new provisions in clause 11 in relation to audits of banks. The new provision will enable the Authority to, in addition to the duties at present imposed on an auditor and largely dictated only by the Companies Act (Cap. 185), call upon the auditor to extend the scope of his audit to give additional information, to carry out other examinations, and to submit a report to the Authority on the results of his work. In addition, the Authority must also be immediately informed if the auditor in the course of his audit discovers serious offences or major losses or serious irregularities that jeopardize the security of creditors or that claims of creditors are not covered by the bank's assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, the conditions that the Authority will lay down for an audit will ensure that the auditor is entirely independent of the bank which he is going to audit. Furthermore, the Authority can insist that a much more rigorous and searching audit is conducted, These amendments, when \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> implemented, should result in external auditors of banks playing a greater role than hitherto in supporting the Authority in the discharge of its supervisory functions over banks. They are clearly designed to give greater protection to depositors and creditors of banks and minimize the likelihood of fraud and other crimes of dishonesty being perpetrated or going undetected. These provisions are based on existing practices of bank regulatory authorities in Germany and Switzerland. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next major amendments to which I would like to draw the attention of Members appear in clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill. These amendments are concerned with the priority of deposit liabilities in the event of a winding up of a bank that is insolvent or is unable to meet its obligations. Clause 13, which amends section 56, provides that the deposit liabilities of a bank shall have priority over all other unsecured liabilities other than those specified in section 292(1) of the Companies Act. The existing section 56 is far too wide-ranging for it could be construed as giving priority over secured debts and over the preferential unsecured debts that are spelt out in section 292(1). The effect of the amendment is, therefore, that in a winding up, though the claims of the depositors of a bank will rank after the claims of, for example, the liquidator for his costs in the winding up, employees of a bank for their wages, and the tax authorities for taxes owed by a bank, their claims will rank above those of the ordinary creditors of a bank. This question of priority of debts, it should be stressed, is only of importance if the assets of a bank are not sufficient to meet the claims of the creditors of a bank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 inserts a new section 56A which provides that amongst the depositors themselves some depositors will have a higher priority ranking in a winding-up than other depositors. Thus first preference will be given to non-bank customers of a bank if the deposit liabilities of the bank are included in the computation of the reserve and liquidity requirements in sections 34 and 35. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second preference will be given to interbank deposit liabilities if they are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> included in the abovementioned reserve and liquidity requirements. The third preference will be given to deposit liabilities with non-bank customers where the deposit liabilities are not included in the reserve and liquidity requirements. This, as I have explained earlier, will ensure that deposits that have been subjected to stricter prudential requirements be given priority of claim accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 56B is designed to facilitate the winding up of a bank caused by the liquidator by notice to require every debtor of a bank to redeem any securities he has deposited with a bank within three months of the date of the notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as Members may know, foreign and domestic financial institutions have been operating the Asian Currency Units for many years. The operators of these Asian Currency Units know that though they are subject to the provisions of the Act but, depending on their status as companies incorporated in Singapore or outside Singapore, they have been, under administrative arrangements with the Authority, exempted from certain provisions of the Act. These exemptions have been an integral part of our efforts in developing our offshore market. The purpose of clause 15 is to put these administrative arrangements on a statutory basis. Subsection (4) of new section 69A now expressly lays down the sections of the Act from which persons operating the Asian Currency Unit will be exempted. Such exemptions from regulatory and other requirements are a general practice in the off-shore banking business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments made by the Bill do not warrant any special mention in addition to what has been stated in reference to them in the Explanatory Statement. While many of the new provisions merely give the force of law to administrative procedures, several are important innovations. It is my intention to keep the situation under observation for about a year during which time we can assess their impact on the banking industry and, if need be, return to the House for another revision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that we can all take satisfaction with the rapid development of the financial sector in Singapore, as supported by the figures given by the First Deputy Prime Minister. That Singapore has developed into a sophisticated financial centre is no mean achievement. But, Sir, we live in an age when there are threats to the international financial system and, therefore, there is need to look at banking regulations to make sure that the spill-over effects onto Singapore are minimized. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I generally support the provisions of this Bill, but I have a number of questions for clarification to pose to the Hon. Minister. If I may take clause 7 first. It is not clear to me whether the provisions here apply only to domestic banks or to Asian Currency Units, or to both. Furthermore, it is not clear to me whether the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) under section 25(1) refer only to individuals, companies and so on, or whether they also refer to countries or sovereign risks. The exceptions which are provided include transactions with the Government. By this, I would take it to mean the Government of Singapore. Is it wise to exempt the Government from the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)? With the present Government in power, I think we can safely allow the banks to loan any money to the Government, but should there be a future Government less wise or less frugal, these provisions might be misused. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the exemption of transactions between banks can pose a sizable loophole in that very substantial loans could be made to other banks, say abroad, which in turn have very unwise loan portfolios. And sub-paragraph (iv) in that exception reads:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(iv) any facilities granted against letters of credit or bills or guarantees or documents in respect of imports into or exports from Singapore;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Again, why should these be exempted from the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b)? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, may I refer to clause 14? The ranking of deposit liabilities suggests to me that domestic depositors would have first claim on the assets of any bank that would be wound up or may be wound up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which clause are you talking about? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am talking about clause 14. The ranking of deposit liabilities in terms of their claims on assets in the event of a wind up of a bank is such that domestic depositors have first claim, which means that the deposit liabilities by the Asian Currency Units would have a last claim because these deposits do not require any reserve requirements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. My question is: what impact would this have on the ACU market in Singapore? Would it destroy confidence on the part of depositors in our ACU banks? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the event of a bankruptcy of any bank which is a branch of a multinational bank, what is the liability of the head office, say, in New York or in London, towards the local branch? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what is the exposure of Singapore banks to sovereign risks. In other words, when we read of the tremendous debts of Brazil, Mexico, Philippines and so on, to what extent are the Asian Currency Units in Singapore committed in terms of these sovereign risks? How concentrated are they? How vulnerable are we? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, we do not have any insurance for depositors at all in Singapore. Is it not time that the MAS went about setting up a system of insurance for depositors, at least up to a certain limit, to protect the small man in the event of a bank failure? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, may I turn to clause 15? It is surprising to me that there was no statutory provision at all for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to establish ACUs. Do I take it that they are all illegal up to this point? The Minister has been there for some years already and this is the first time that he is bringing this issue before this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it is all very well to introduce a lot of regulations, but do we have the manpower to implement these regulations? What is the average age of the senior officers of the MAS, excluding the First Deputy Prime Minister and his Managing Director? I say this purposely, Sir, because it has been brought to my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> attention that when foreign bankers of note and of position visit Singapore, if they are not big enough to attract a lunch or an interview with the First Deputy Prime Minister or the Managing Director, they are shunted off to some senior officer who is in his twenties or early thirties. I am just looking at it from the point of view of the visiting banker who is usually in his fifties or sixties having to deal with very young officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really rise on a point of clarification from the Hon. Minister. I am concerned with clause 5 of the Bill which, as the Minister has pointed out, introduces three new sections to the Banking Act. The Minister has said quite rightly that the sections do not bring in a total prohibition against persons acquiring an effective control or even having a substantial holding. He has said that it is intended to prevent outsiders taking control of the domestic banks. These new sections do not just apply to foreigners or outsiders. It is intended to apply to Singapore citizens as well. And the Minister then went on to amplify that by saying that it is intended to prevent undesirable persons from taking control or having a substantial holding in the bank. The question, Sir, is who are \"undesirable persons\"? I see that the arbiter of this is the Authority. Are we to understand that it is left entirely to the Authority to determine whether an applicant, a person who proposes to enter into an agreement, is desirable or undesirable? Following on the last speaker's remarks, one would assume that somebody who is perhaps associated with an opposition party may not be a desirable person. Is that the criterion by which we are going to consider applications? [Interruption]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what I have heard from Backbenchers there. Would they like to repeat? I would like to answer them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Neither have I heard it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> There is no definition of the categories of persons who should be excluded from taking effective control or having a substantial holding in a bank. I would like the Minister, perhaps if he can, to try and elaborate on this. Against whom \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is this provision intended? Who are these undesirable persons that he has in mind? Because, as I said, it catches everybody - Singapore citizens and outsiders as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am sure the Hon. Minister would agree that even in banking we must bring in the democratic process. As I said, the Authority would appear to be the sole judge. Does he not think that we should provide an appeal from the Authority if the Authority unreasonably refuses to give approval to any intended arrangement? What is the danger in providing an appeal from the Authority, say, to the court, for the court to determine whether the reasons of the Authority are reasonable or not? The new sections 14A, 14B and 14C do not require the Authority to give any reasons. There is no reference to the Authority being required to give reasons. Should the Authority not be required to give reasons where it refuses any proposed arrangement sought to be entered into with a bank by any person in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 8 (the proposed new section 27A) talks about banks acquiring shares in companies. If you look at the proposed subsection (2), it says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Authority may approve the entering into the agreement with or without conditions or may disapprove it without giving any reasons.' \n  <br>\n  <br>Again, may I ask: why should the Authority not be required to give reasons? Should the Authority not be asked to give reasons where it refuses to give its approval to any agreement submitted to it? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have to say, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>3.50 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I will deal first with the few points raised by the Member for Anson. They are not really matters of great substance. As usual, he believes in the British practice of fair play, manifest justice, such-like doctrine. Let us remember that we are not dealing in law courts but with the banking system where billions of dollars are at stake, where the reputation of bankers is known to the market, where the reputation of rising financiers is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> known. Therefore, the question of undesirable hands cannot be defined in simple legal terms, nor can decisions made on the acquisition of shares be subject to appeal. Such practices are known in central banks the world over which exercise very much the same powers and discretion as are being sought in clauses 5 and 8. Let me assure him that this is not directed against the hon. Member or any member of his Party. If for no other reason than that, I doubt whether any member of his Party would have the wherewithal to acquire 20%, for instance, he would need something like $280 million to make a bid, just the initial bid for one of our bigger banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has raised a number of queries. I am not sure whether I got all his quest.'ons right or whether I have recorded them correctly. First of all, he is in error when he thinks that clause 7 does not apply to foreign banks. It does. In the case of foreign banks which have branches here, the capital funds refer to the net headquarters' funds remitted from the headquarters of the bank to the Singapore branch. And all loan limits are related to net headquarters' funds so remitted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure whether I understood his objection to some of these provisions. For instance, he said that there should not be any exemptions from the provisions of section 25(1) (a) and (b) in respect of transactions with the Government, on the grounds that some future government might be less prudent than the present one and therefore should be denied access to bank funds. I have some sympathy with that point of view. I do not think it is possible to legislate against disasters of that kind. Long before the government begins borrowing money from the banks, we will be in dire trouble and matters other than banking will be requiring the attention of the government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should letters of credit be exempted? The answer is that unlike loans and other credit facilities which are really long-term on-going ones, letters of credit and bills of exchange and such like are self-liquidating documents and are therefore exempted from the limits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is roughly right in regard to his interpretation of clause 14. It is not so much domestic deposits in the sense of deposits of residents of Singapore which have prior claim. It is the currency in which deposits are made. If you make a deposit with a bank in the Singapore dollar, then the bank is required to keep certain reserves with the Monetary Authority. And therefore in the event the bank goes bust, either because of mismanagement or misfortune, then your deposit has priority over claims arising from deposits in other currencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know how safe the ACU deposits are and what would be the impact on Singapore of a general financial collapse. It is not for me to make predictions about the state of the international monetary banking system other than to say that if it runs into trouble, then I fear that the impact would not only be on the banking system in Singapore but it would probably lead to a world-wide depression of some severity. And that depression would continue until the governments of the industrial countries and the central bankers have put together a more durable and a better international financial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assessing the position of ACU deposits in Singapore banks, Members should remember - it is not widely known - that the great majority of these offshore deposits are held in offshore banks or in foreign banks, ACU units of foreign banks. The local banks have only very small amounts because most of these deposits are deposits of non-residents. For instance, if they are multi-national corporations, they put their deposits in a bank which is known to them in their own country. So in effect, this offshore banking business is largely conducted by foreign banks dealing with foreign depositors and lending to other countries. We are just hosts offering facilities such as office, staff, telex machines and such like. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct impact of, say, insolvency or sovereign debt should it arise, to Singapore banks is minimal because they have very small amounts of ACU deposits. And such amounts even if they are unwisely lent would not make a large dent into their total assets. So our local banks, domestic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> banks, should in terms of financial liquidity stand up to a sovereign debt crisis quite well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards deposit insurance scheme, there was one such scheme in the United States that was necessary. I think it was introduced as a result of the Great Depression when virtually every day one American bank went bankrupt and people lost money as a result of that. We have not had such an unhappy experience. I think it is better to ensure that bankers who handle your money are men of repute and trustworthy people, That is a better insurance, better safeguard, for your deposits than the deposit insurance scheme. If you have a deposit insurance scheme, somebody must pay. Why pay? Why not make sure that the banks in the first instance do not lend recklessly monies entrusted to them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second last point he made was in regard to the Asian Deposit, whether they are illegal. I am not a lawyer, Mr Speaker, Sir. But what actually happened is that the applications of the Banking Act were not applied to them. Since the AttorneyGeneral is aware of this situation, I assume that the practices of the Monetary Authority in this regard are quite legal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the age of our bank regulators and the complaints that the Member has received from foreign bankers who want to see the supervisor and are received by someone who looks young but actually is not all that young, and they are quite distressed, the hon. Member must remember that bankers want to see the top man. They even want to see the Prime Minister. They want to see me. On some occasions I unwisely agreed to see them. What happened? What matters did they raise? Things concerning the state of the world economy? Something of grave importance? This is trivial. I told them, \"Look, what about letting me manage a few hundred millions of your assets?\" You know, sales pitch. So the Member for Whampoa must not be overawed by the foreign bankers, either by their bearing or their age. They are here to do business. We welcome them. They are here to make money. We hope they make money. We are their host. They are our guests. But \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they must follow our rules and regulations. And if they do that, well, we wish them the best. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the complaints give me cause for concern because I had heard that shortly after the Hon. Minister took over -- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you asking for a point of clarification or are you going to make another speech, because Standing Order 44 only allows you to speak once on any question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> It is just a clarification, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

As a result, it lost many senior officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point on deposit insurance, Sir, I would urge the Hon. Minister to give serious consideration to this. The reason why I drew his attention to the vulnerability of exposure of Singapore banks to sovereign risks was his amendment to section 56 and his talk about the event of a winding up of a bank. Why should this provision be there unless there is some cause for concern? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>4.06 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1983\" to \"1984\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year in page 4, line 12, in page 7, line 3, and in page 8, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> line 1, has also to be altered from \"1983\" to \"1984\".

Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Companies Act came into force on 29th December, 1967. It was amended in 1970, 1973, and 1974. The present Bill represents a major review of our Company Law with the intention that it will keep pace with the many developments that have taken place in areas such as the securities industry and the capital market. It also seeks to rectify various anomalies and inadequacies which have been experienced in the administration of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of its comprehensive and rather complex nature, I wish to say that it is proposed to refer this Bill to a Select Committee to enable the views of all interested parties to be obtained before the Bill is finalized. To enable every Member of this House to have a better understanding of the objects of the Bill, it may be classified into five main groups - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) amendments that would improve the administration of the Act; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) amendments that would ensure that the Act is more responsive to developments in the capital market; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) amendments that would afford greater protection to creditors, investors or shareholders in such areas as rights issues, insider trading in shares and takeover and winding up situations; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) amendments that directly affect directors of companies; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) amendments that would give effect to certain recommendations made by the Jenkins Committee in the United Kingdom on the reform of company law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dealing separately with each of these groups, permit me to refer to one of the amendments that does not fall into any of these groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9, 50 and 51 enable the Registrar to refuse the registration of a company where he is satisfied that the proposed company is likely to be used for an unlawful purpose or for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order or the national interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first group of amendments, they are amendments designed to remove anomalies in the Act and to improve the administration of the legislation and vary from enabling microfilming of documents to enabling the Minister by regulation to prescribe the size, durability and legibility of documents delivered to the Registrar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of amendments relates to the enhancement of Singapore as a financial centre and are of wider importance and significance. Some of the more important amendments here would be referred to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 will enable the Registrar to exempt corporations of an international character from certain prospectus requirements relating to the signing of the prospectus by all the directors. Experience has shown that the existing requirements in this regard are sometimes impracticable in the case of international corporations where none of the directors are resident in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 is designed to extend the ambit of the exemption that is granted by the Minister to a prescribed corporation from complying with the provisions of Division 4 of PART IV of the Act relating to the issue of debentures. At present the section only exempts a prescribed corporation from complying with section 74. However, there are many other provisions in Division 4 that still apply to a prescribed corporation. Corporations concerned in loan syndication find that strict adherence to all the requirements in this section are necessarily burdensome and put obstacles in the way of the development of the bond market in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Fifth Schedule requires in paragraph 3 of PART I that the names, description and addresses of directors must be included in the prospectus. The amendment in clause 69 will permit directors of a prescribed corporation to give only their city or locality. This is considered necessary to safeguard the security of these directors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of amendments is designed to give better protection to investors. In the past, subscribers to rights issues by companies have lost substantial sums of money by taking up their rights and finding that the company's financial affairs or trading prospects are in a poor state. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 2(b) read with clause 17 is to oblige quoted companies making a renounceable rights issue to bring out a full prospectus or an abridged prospectus. Issuing companies may apply to the Registrar to publish an abridged prospectus. If granted permission, they will be exempt from the requirements of the Fifth Schedule but will instead have to comply with the requirements of the new PART V of the Fifth Schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area in which investors can be placed at a disadvantage is where officers or employees of a company indulge in the unlawful practice of dealing in shares at a time when they are in possession of price-sensitive information. To remedy inadequacies in this area, clause 32 proposes to amend the law in two major respects. First, it brings substantial shareholders of com- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> panies into the class of insider traders. Secondly, it contains definitions of \"special confidential information\" and the phrase \"if generally known\" in relation to such information. The purpose of these amendments is to facilitate proof of insider trading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important amendment concerns take-overs. Clause 45 proposes very substantial amendments to the take-over provisions in the Act. Although the Securities Industry Council (SIC) in administering the Code on Take-overs and Mergers is generally regarded as an effective body, it does depend for its effectiveness upon the active cooperation of those engaged in take-overs to play according to the rules and to ensure self-regulation under the supervision of the SIC. However, the Code is a voluntary one, even though it is recognized by statute, and cases have arisen where the powers of sanction under the Code are inadequate to deal with certain devices in take-over situations that have been resorted to by a few members of the financial community engaged in take-over bids. It is felt therefore that statutory intervention is needed to deal with serious cases of default whereby the investing public may suffer loss as a result of the activities of unscrupulous companies or individuals. Accordingly, sections 179, 179A and the Tenth Schedule have been extended to apply to natural persons as well as corporations (whether incorporated or carrying on business in Singapore or not) making a take-over bid but these provisions will not apply to private companies, companies limited by guarantee or by shares and guarantee. Bluffing offers will be prohibited. Every would-be bidder with a firm intention to make a take-over bid will be bound to make a public announcement in the newspapers of that intention and give certain information to the investing public. The amendment also seeks to harmonize the provisions of section 179 and the Tenth Schedule with those in the Code on Take-overs and Mergers to facilitate the administration of take-overs, both under the law and under the Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, further powers are given to the SIC by the law to conduct enquiries into misconduct in a take-over and to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> summon witnesses and produce documents. Since the SIC has from time to time to bring out rulings in take-overs that criticize parties to a take-over or their financial advisers, it is essential that the SIC should not be exposed to actions for defamation of character if it is to do its job properly and fairly. It is accordingly proposed that it should have statutory immunity in this regard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the fourth group of amendments that directly affect companies' directors, I should refer to clause 27 which fills a gap in section 122 by providing that a director shall not resign or vacate his office unless there are at least two directors remaining, one of whom must ordinarily reside in Singapore. Numerous exceptions are, however, provided for the operation of this provision so far as they affect directors who are disqualified under the Act or under the legislation relating to insurance, banking or finance companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 provides for the disqualification of directors of companies that have gone into liquidation from acting as a director of another company within five years after the second company of which they were directors has gone into liquidation. Further, clause 31 provides that where a person has been persistently in default in relation to the requirements of the Act concerning delivery of documents to the Registrar and has been convicted of three or more offences in relation to such defaults or has had an order made against him under section 12 or 362 of the Act, such person can be disqualified from acting as a director within five years of the last conviction without leave of the court. Other amendments in this group relate to the giving of loans to directors or members of their family or to a company connected with directors or members of their family of the lending company where the first mentioned company is incorporated outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the final group of amendments that would give effect to the Jenkins Committee recommendations on company law made in the United Kingdom in 1962, I wish in particular to refer to the amendments in clause 2(a) and clause 7(b) and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> elsewhere in the Bill that would have the effect of preventing companies limited by guarantee having a share capital from being incorporated in future in Singapore. It is quite inappropriate that a company formed with the intention of making pro rata distribution of profits to its members should be registrable as a company by guarantee. A company should either be limited by shares or by guarantee but not both. This hybrid company structure is rarely resorted to these days and there are very few such companies that have been incorporated in Singapore. Such companies that are so incorporated will have a transitional period of two years to convert either to a company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment in this group which I would like to mention appears in clause 13 where a company which is an unlimited company may be converted to a limited company, and a limited company is permitted to be converted to an unlimited company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to refer to clause 73 which increases the fines imposed in many of the provisions of the Act so as to more accurately reflect present day values. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>4.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Companies (Amendment) Bill gives me an opportunity to draw the attention of the Government to a matter which I think is in need of redress. The Bill of course is being moved before this House to redress matters which are equally, if not more, cogent and valid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is concerned with the proper functioning of a company registered and operating in Singapore. Thus the matters to be redressed are the provisions relating to the promoters and the directors of companies with a view to ensuring the protection of shareholders under the Bill. It is not my intention, nor my inclination, to touch on these provisions of the Bill as there are other Members in this House far more competent and qualified to give a critical opinion of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a trade unionist and my concern is with the few provisions in the Bill affecting the interests of workers. Nonetheless, I must place on record my gratitude to the Minister for including among the provisions of the Bill a timely amendment to protect the interests of workers who have as their employer a limited company. It is a small but significant token of recognition by the Government that a company does not operate in a milieu peopled only with promoters, directors, shareholders and registrars. Workers also have their rights and interests very much bounded up with the proper functioning of a company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer particularly to clause 53 of the Bill which seeks to amend section 292 of the Companies Act to the effect that (1) the amount of wages of workers which are recoverable upon the winding up of a company is to be increased from $1,500 to an amount that is equivalent to five months' salary and (2) an \"employee\" is deemed to include a sub-contractor of labourers and \"salary\" is deemed to include notice pay or payment in lieu of notice. These amendments are undoubtedly based on the experience of the Ministry of Labour in the course of administering the Employment Act. Section 46 of the Employment Act makes a cross reference to section 292 of the Companies Act regarding the recoverability of any gratuity or retrenchment benefit payable to workers under a collective agreement upon the liquidation of a company. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of clause 53 is clear to the Members of the House and I do not think anyone in the House would object in principle to this clause. Workers in Singapore would substantially benefit from the implementation of clause 53 of the Bill. For one thing, the sum of $1,500 has been rendered grossly inadequate by wage-levels in Singapore rising very far above that when the Companies Act was enacted in 1967. The sum is rendered more grossly inadequate when it refers to the total amount of salary owing to a sub-contractor who may have any number of workers under him and looking to him for the payment of their wages. If there is any objection to the proposed amendment, it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is that it may not be practical to restrict the recoverable arrears of salary to within four months before the commencement of winding-up. I do not think it is necessary for me to dwell on this point any longer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now ask Members of this House to try to imagine a situation where, despite the eventual adoption of the Bill, including clause 53, the workers of a company which is being wound up may not receive a single cent for whatever arrears of wages owing by the company, as in the recent case of the enforced winding-up of Overseas Union Finance. This situation is highly probable when the company owes its secured creditors more than what it has in assets or it has no assets worth speaking of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if such a company is not being wound up but continues to operate in Singapore, the workers of the company may still not be able to recover whatever money is owing to them by the company. My Union, the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union, had a most unforgettable and unpleasant experience with such a company. Because the company persistently refused to discuss with my Union the payment of a retrenchment benefit to our three retrenched members under a valid collective agreement, we took the matter up in the Industrial Arbitration Court. Our claim was upheld by the Court but the company refused to comply with the award of the IAC. Then we went back to the Industrial Arbitration Court again to obtain an order requiring the company to comply with the award of the Court. Still the company refused to pay and we applied for and obtained a further order of the Court directing the secretary/ director of the company, the only director who was resident in Singapore, to comply with the award of the Court under pain of contempt. Subsequently, the director sought and obtained from the High Court an order of certiorari to quash the order of the Industrial Arbitration Court on the ground that it was wrongly made in that a director of a company is not liable for the debt of the company under the company law except if there is fraud, breach of warranty of authority or any other exceptional circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the basis of what I have said, I hope the Minister would seriously consider my suggestion to further amend clause 53 of the Bill. In paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of section 292 of the Act, the words \"within a period of four months\" appearing in the ninth and tenth lines thereof should be amended to read \"within a period of one year\". My ground for so suggesting, Sir, is that workers may agree to their company deferring the payment of a portion of their salary over a considerable period of time in the hope of helping the company and saving their own jobs. It would be most unfortunate if the arrears of salary have accrued outside the period of four months before the winding-up, as presently stated in the Act. My suggested period of one year would be more equitable and less restrictive. Besides, the overriding limitation of the quantum of five months' salary still applies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I suggest that the term \"salary\" should also be deemed to include any payment by way of gratuity or retrenchment benefit or provident fund contributions, subject to the overriding limitation of a maximum quantum of five months' salary. The balance of gratuity or retrenchment benefit or provident fund contributions that cannot be paid under the priority ranking of arrears of salary will have to make-do with the respective lower priority ranking as set out in section 292 of the Act. My ground for so suggesting is that, more often than not, workers are owed by their employer who is a company, their gratuity or retrenchment benefit or provident fund contributions rather than arrears of salary. My suggested amendment would allow workers in such circumstances to recover at least a portion of their gratuity or retrenchment benefit or provident fund. If my suggestion appears to be tantamount to enabling workers to jump the queue, so to speak, at the expense of possibly the Income Tax Department, please remember that the recovery of such payment or benefit may be a matter of life or death to the workers and their families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I have to admit I am at a loss as to how to suggest a reasonable way of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> redressing the situation where a company has no assets and its directors are not liable for the company's debts, including debts owing to its workers. It is not practical to expect workers to know the financial position of a company before accepting employment by it. Nor do the workers have any reason to suspect that the company may not be able to honour its obligation to pay gratuity or retrenchment benefit under a collective agreement when the company regularly pays wages and allowances without fail. It is only upon termination of service by the company that the workers find their employer to be a two-dimensional legal fiction without any substance. In the absence of any better redress, I would suggest that the Companies Act be amended to require, as a condition for the registration of a company without a minimum amount of capital that is reasonably substantial, the company be required to show proof of its ability to meet its obligations to its employees in the normal course of its operations, such as a banker's guarantee to cover any eventuality. As the trend is definitely towards more and more employers in Singapore being impersonal companies rather than human persons, the Companies Act should make adequate provisions to safeguard the interests of the employees of companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the hon. Member for Toa Payoh for his comments on the Bill, in particular, clause 53. I have noted his points with regard to this clause. May I inform Members of the House that this clause 53, in seeking to amend section 292, actually takes into account proposals which were made by the NTUC about 1 1/2 years ago. I take it that the hon. Member for Toa Payoh is not in disagreement with the amendments, but he seeks to make further improvements and to bring in additional safeguards which he considers necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my notes, he has really proposed three safeguards, or three additional amendments. First, he has proposed to amend section 292, subsection (1), paragraph (b), to extend the period of four months to one year. The second amendment, I take it, is to extend the meaning of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \"salary\" in that section to include any payment by way of gratuity or retrenchment benefit or provident fund contributions, subject to an over-riding limitation of five months' salary. His third amendment, I understand, is to require, as a condition for the registration of a company without a minimum amount of capital that is reasonably substantial, to show proof of its ability to meet its obligations to its employees, such as, as he has suggested, a banker's guarantee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that I have mentioned that it is proposed to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, perhaps it is best that we take cognizance of the three points made by the Member for Toa Payoh and to assure him that each of these three points will be examined very carefully by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Companies (Amendment) Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting of the Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\" - [Prof. S.

It is labour-intensive and heavily dependent on foreign workers. Construction productivity whilst increasing in recent years is still low. Insufficient attention has been paid to blending building designs with modern methods of construction. Training oppor- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tunities and courses have been few and ad hoc. Labour turnover is high and the labour force is relatively unskilled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Government's policy to expand and upgrade our construction capabilities and productivity, so that the industry can meet future demands more efficiently. We have to reorganize, restructure and industrialize the construction industry in order to meet these objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With industrialized building methods, buildings and structures can be put up with fewer workers, at a shorter time, and with better finishes. The corresponding labour productivity gains can be translated into better wages for our local workers. The productivity improvements will also reduce and curb excessive and uneconomical use of labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialization in the building industry entails the widespread use of mechanized and prefabricated methods of construction. It requires not only changes in component fabrication and building erection technologies but also structural changes to the building industry as a whole. The changes can only be brought about by enlisting the concerted effort of all parties involved in the construction industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Construction Industry Development Board Bill therefore seeks to set up a central co-ordinating body to spearhead, promote, develop, and monitor the industrialization programmes for the construction industry. The Board members shall be appointed from both the public and private sectors so that the collective expertise of the industry can be synergized to guide the industry towards industrialization and modernization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will enable the Board to perform several major tasks, in particular:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Technology Development - A major task of the Board is to examine, review and devise standards of building components and pre-cast building systems, with a view to introducing standardization measures which promote and facilitate the greater use of modular components in building design and construction. The Board will also help Government examine and revise Building regulations to adapt them to industrialized building technologies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Manpower Development - The Board will be responsible for training and continuing education of construction workers. It will develop long-term manpower plans to upgrade construction productivity and to provide trained manpower to meet the demands of the industry. It will liaise closely with the professionals and employers in the industry for the advancement of construction skills. The Government's Construction Industry Training Centre, which seeks to train Singaporeans on modern construction skills, will be transferred to the Board once it is set up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will generally help Government formulate and implement policies on construction development. It will be given sufficient power to administer financial and other incentive schemes to encourage the industry to upgrade, modernize and mechanize. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds necessary for the operation of the Board will come from Government. For the Board's training activities, subsidies from the Skills Development Fund will also be sought. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in introducing the Bill, the Minister said - I hope I have heard it right - that the construction industry was in need of upgrading, or being made more efficient, if that was what he was implying. I am surprised to hear that coming from the Minister. After all, he has been the Minister (I do not know for how many years) in charge of, largely, Construction in Singapore. There seems to be something wrong if after all these years we are still very much, shall I say, backward that we need a Board now to upgrade the construction industry in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I want to question is, even if it is admitted that the Construction industry does need upgrading or made more efficient, whatever you may like to call it, why do we need to have another Board? We seem to have a penchant for creating boards and committees. I see by clause 6, subclause (5): \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Board shall pay to the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and other members of the Board such salaries, fees and allowances as the Minister may from time to time determine.' \n  <br>\n  <br>That is just salaries of the members of the Board. What about the salaries of the staff and the administrative costs? Do we really need a Board for the purposes of the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir? After all, we have other Boards at the moment which had been set up, I would have thought, precisely for this purpose. If he will examine section 11 of the Bill, or clause 11 I should rightly call it, he will find under that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'11.-(1) The functions of the Board are - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to promote the development, improvement and expansion of the construction industry;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Well, very laudable. But why do we need a Board for this? Is it not within the competence of the Minister's Ministry to carry out this development, improvement and expansion of the construction industry? We have got a Public Works Department, which I take it is quite efficient, which would be able to give advice to whoever is involved in the construction industry how to improve their services and their skills. And then: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(b) to facilitate and assist in the mechanisation of the construction industry;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Do we really need a Board again for this, Mr Speaker, Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) to advise and make recommendations to the Government on matters affecting or connected with the construction industry;' \n  <br>\n  <br>I can go on asking the same question: Do we need a Board for this? What is the necessity for setting up a Board, paying members' salaries, staff, administrative costs, to do things that perhaps can be done by the Ministry, by the Government and by other Boards which have all been set up to promote standards and efficiency in the construction industry. Have we not got Boards? I thought we have SISIR and other Boards setting proper standards in Singapore. Do we need to have another Board now? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(e) to provide consultancy and advisory services with respect to construction works;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Again, what is wrong with the Ministry providing advisory services? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(f) to keep under review the training requirements of the construction industry and assist in providing training facilities;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Have we not got the VITB? What is the VITB doing? I thought it was to provide training facilities and skills. And then:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(g) to promote the advancement of the skills [again] and expertise of persons engaged in the construction industry;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Well, I repeat: What is the VITB doing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(h) to promote or undertake research into any matter relating to the construction industry;' \n  <br>\n  <br>I should have thought we have enough boards, enough committees, enough bodies, which are promoting or under-taking research in several matters in Singapore. So, as I see it, Mr Speaker, Sir, all these functions of the Board which are proposed in this clause 11 can be carried out without having to set up another expensive setup or organization and incurring expenditure of public monies on doing something which, I say, we have got enough bodies to do, not counting the Minister's own Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if I may turn to clause 12 of the Bill, it says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Board shall have power to do anything for the purpose of discharging its functions under this Act, or which is incidental or conducive to the discharge of those functions . . .' \n  <br>\n  <br>And it says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) provide financial assistance in the form of grants, loans or otherwise to persons engaged in the construction industry . . .' \n  <br>\n  <br>Do we really need a Board so that the Government first channels the money to the Board and then the Board gives the assistance? What is wrong with the Ministry doing this? Why do we have to duplicate all this? Is it not a waste of public monies? As I say, there is a penchant for setting up boards and committees all over the place for everything you can think of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(b) promote and assist in the export of services to carry out construction work overseas;' \n  <br>\n  <br>I thought recently we set up a Trade Development Board to promote trade and services outside Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (c) says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(C) organise courses and award diplomas and certificates of proficiency;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Here we go again. There is the VITB doing this, and now we want another board to do this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (d) says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(d) form or participate in the formation of a company;, \n  <br>\n  <br>Is it the intention that the Construction Industry Development Board should itself now take equities in companies, go into business? Is that the intention? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (e) says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(e) enter into a partnership or an arrangement for the sharing of profits;' \n  <br>\n  <br>There again, is it the intention that this Board should now go into business? Why? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (f) says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(f) charge fees or commissions for services rendered by the Board;' \n  <br>\n  <br>Again, I see it as increasing the cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraphs (g) and (h) say:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) promote or undertake publicity in any form; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) do anything incidental to any of its powers.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask the Minister to take this Bill back and to give it very serious consideration, whether this is absolutely necessary or whether all these things that are proposed for this Board cannot be done by the boards that have already been set up, and by his own Ministry. This will save all the salaries that have to be paid to the members of the Board and other administrative expenses. Perhaps the savings could be channelled to the Ministry of Health to pay for the Class C hospital charges where the need is greatest, The need is not here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. Again, I have complained about this when speaking on Bills setting up boards. When you come to it, you find that the entire power is vested in the Minister. You see, by clause 5, that all the members shall be appointed by the Minister. It says:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) a member to be appointed as Chairman; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a member to be appointed as Deputy Chairman; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) not less than 5 nor more than 12 other members.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then clause 6(1) says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A member of the Board shall hold office for such term as the Minister shall specify . . .'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, by clause 6(2), the Minister can remove any member of the Board. Do we really need a Board? Can the Minister not perhaps get a few people to do what he wants the Board to do if he has the power to appoint and fire them? I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he should spend some time doing all these things rather than setting up another board and paying salaries. \n  <br>5.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the consequences of rapid growth in our economy is the burgeoning construction industry and the enormous demands which have been put on the industry, especially in terms of skilled workers. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of this is that buildings are put up very rapidly and standards of finish are less than desirable and in some cases the work has been shoddy. From this point of view, I think the setting up of the Board is a good thing. It is a timely thing. It is a necessary thing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at the functions of the Board and the vision which is provided in this Bill, I can only congratulate the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> In clause 12 (b), it says the Board may \"promote and assist in the export of services to carry out construction works overseas\". I think this is a farsighted move because we are accumulating a lot of expertise in building, in laying out designs of industrial estates, Housing Board estates, port facilities and so on. This expertise is in great demand internationally. And the Koreans and people from other countries have been quick to capitalize on this kind of export services. By organizing this Board in this manner, I think we may be able to capture part of that market. Of course, unlike the Koreans, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we do not have the skilled labour to export but we can organize other people's workers and provide the managerial expertise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one small matter - small in the light of the functions of the Board - but important from the point of view of a lot of home owners, and that has to do with the renovations which many people have to do, whether in HDB flats or in private dwellings. They have encountered, and I also have encountered, cases of contractors who cheat them in terms of materials used, in terms of time required to be taken to finish the particular contract. In one instance, the contractor got hold of the deposit of 30% or so and then disappeared without doing anything for that person. So I would like to urge the Minister to consider under the purview of this Board to get contractors registered properly and then have an accreditation list so that only those contractors with a good track record would be able to undertake renovations. And that some compensation scheme be devised so that home owners are protected in the event that contractors do not fulfill their part of the contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister once again for this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I wish to thank the hon. Member for Whampoa for understanding the purpose of setting up the Board which, unfortunately, the hon. Member for Anson seems to fail to understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Anson, I have just now said that the building industry in Singapore needs upgrading. In the opinion of the hon. Member for Anson, it would appear that the Singapore Government or the Ministry of National Development is sleeping all the time and did not do the upgrading and then we have to set up the Board to upgrade. That is a statement which goes against the grains of modern development. As we know, we are living in a period where all the technology, not only in the industries but also in the office are constantly improving. The hon. Member for Anson will know that all the modern offices are now going into computerization, to upgrade the office efficiency. And in the industries I think all the countries \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are looking and citing Japan as an example. Why are the Japanese industries able to overtake other industrialized countries? It is because the Japanese industries are constantly being upgraded. If the hon. Member for Anson's theory holds good, then those countries which are already industrially advanced should not do any further upgrading because any other country that does further upgrading would mean that these industrially advanced countries are sleeping and are not upgrading. That is the theory which the Member for Anson is trying to propagate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Singapore building industry is fairly extensive, and I think Singapore has invested billions of dollars in the building industry not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. So the building industry is constantly upgrading its technology and skills. This is essential so that we will be able to continuously increase productivity. So to form the Board to upgrade the building industry does not mean that the Ministry of National Development has done nothing previously. The Singapore Government is upgrading the building industry and it will continue to do so. We are setting up this Board to upgrade the building industry and we will further organize various training programmes, various training schools and various organizations to further upgrade the industry. And I think constant upgrading is essential if our building industry is going to be efficient. In fact, constant upgrading is essential for all the industries. Any industry which does not continue to upgrade its skills will find itself falling behind and I think;he industry will eventually collapse and be wiped out. That explains why it is essential for us to form this Board to upgrade the building Industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the various organizations with various responsibilities of the building industry, it is correct to say that the HDB is building public housing, the PWD is building roads. The HDB is upgrading skills, such as introducing the industrialized method of construction for its public housing. The PWD has introduced various modern machinery, modern techniques for road construction, and so on and so forth. We are constantly upgrading . But \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that is not good enough. These various authorities organize training courses, as I mentioned earlier, usually on a piecemeal and ad hoc basis. The VITB is just one of the organizations. In other words, the various organizations are doing ad hoc training, ad hoc upgrading programmes for the building industry. And this is unsatisfactory. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is contradictory to what the hon. Member for Anson believes - that by forming this Board it is a waste of money. The truth is the other way round. By forming this Board, we will save a lot of money because all training related to the building industry, related to the introduction of new technology, new machinery, will come under a single organization, so that all training can be properly coordinated. A lot of duplication will be avoided and a lot of money will be saved because it is under a single body. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> A point of clarification, Sir. I think the Minister has perhaps misunderstood the import of my remarks. It is not that I was saying you should not do anything to bring the construction industry up-to-date on its construction methods. Why is it necessary to set up a board now? Why can't the Ministry do it? What is wrong with that, instead of saying we need a board to upgrade and upgrading is essential? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have just answered that this Board will be formed to coordinate all the activities of the various organizations. In fact, I am coming to the point of repeating myself. My Ministry cannot do it because, first, the Ministry of National Development is not, for example, in charge of VITB. But once this Board is formed, then this Board will take over the function of training the workers. If this board considers it essential that it should take over the functions of the VITB, it will take over. But the Ministry of National Development alone, cannot take over. The Ministry of National Development is in charge of only part of the building industry, not the total building industry, because part of the training of manpower is under the Ministry of Education and other organizations. So the reason for forming this Board is to coordinate all the activities to come under \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one body. A more important point is that this Board, as I have mentioned earlier, is to bring both the public and the private sectors together. My Ministry alone is not able to do this because my Ministry is looking after part of the public construction programme and we do not bring in the private sector. The intention of this Board is to involve the private sector as well. In fact, a substantial number of the Board members will come from the private sector. So the whole construction industry can be properly coordinated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>5.33 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be changed from \"1983\" to \"1984\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 29 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STATUTORY BOARDS (TAXABLE SERVICES) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.35 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 1982, a surcharge of 20% of the electricity bill was imposed on owners of centrally air-conditioned commercial buildings who fail to achieve an Overall Thermal Transfer Value standard of less than 45 w/sq m. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most owners of buildings have complied with this requirement but there is a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> residual number of recalcitrant owners who despite all appeals have not taken steps to comply with the energy conservation standard.

As I said, I do not really have any quarrel with that. But I want to talk, if I may, Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, on the method of how this is achieved, and that is the delegation of a power which really belongs to Parliament. It is on that that I wish to speak. I have been trying to raise this in this sitting and the last sitting by a Motion on the Adjournment, but I have not been successful. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But is it related to this particular Bill, Mr Jeyaretnam? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is, Mr Speaker.

The Bill also enables the Bank to offer certain additional types of banking services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing objects of POSB are to promote thrift and to deploy the funds so garnered for public development. These objects have been achieved. To provide a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> better service to its customers, the Bank is seeking approval to offer personal fixed deposits, personal current accounts and the sale of travellers' cheques. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain restrictions are placed on the POSB to ensure that it steers clear of risks inherent in commercial banking business. The Bank will lend mainly to the public sector, that is, statutory boards and companies in which the Government has a substantial interest. It will be prohibited from extending loans to any individual in excess of $5,000 without any security, or in excess of $30,000 solely upon the security of any guarantee or guarantees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The POSB will exercise financial prudence in its investment activities. It may hold Government securities, mortgages of property and deposits with licensed banks. It may, with the approval of the Minister, invest in shares and securities where these are considered to be in the economic interest of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such restrictions and prudence are in keeping with the POSB's role as a national savings bank whose deposits are guaranteed by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for a new section 46, which will remove any possible doubt that the POSB enjoys the protection of a banker under the Bills of Exchange Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>5.46 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Chong Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to offer a few comments and observations on the Post Office Savings Bank of Singapore (Amendment) Bill. To-date, there are 2.49 million savings accounts, with depositors' balances exceeding $6 billion. This indeed speaks very well for the Post Office Savings Bank and the services it has been providing for all Singaporeans. This is indeed a creditable record. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that as a result of the Amendment Bill further services will be provided to these 2.49 million accounts. These services are spelt out clearly in the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> new section 5, particularly (a), (b) and (c) which are of special importance to the account holder. The provision of checking account will indeed be a big boon to the small man. The small account holder can now have a checking account which has been traditionally denied to him. Large banks have tended to look upon small account holders as inconveniences and to discourage the small man they have imposed such conditions as minimum balances and charging service fees if minimum limits are absent. I sincerely hope the POSB which has served the small man very well for so long will not be tempted to impose such prohibitive conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now moving towards a cashless society and this move to offer checking accounts is a step in the right direction. All protests about unfair competition, I am afraid, does not hold water as this market segment really does not interest the big banks, Having catered for the needs of the small man, I think it is only fair and proper for POSB to have such additional benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2.49 million accounts have supported the POSB largely because of the tax exempt status on interest earned. This factor has been most instrumental in the growth of the POSB. It is important that this tax exempt status is maintained at all times, otherwise I am afraid it will be a breach of faith by the Government. A categorical statement to the effect from the Minister would be most reassuring to all account holders, including myself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next I would like to refer to the new section 5 (h) of the Bill which states that the Bank shall have powers \"to form or participate in the formation of a company or enter into partnership or an arrangement for the sharing of profits as may be conducive to the functions of the Bank.\" Here, I would like to see some caution exercised so that the funds of the POSB are properly invested and must be fully accountable to the Minister at all times. I do not think we want to see situations where the Bank can take a minority stake in a company and then this new company starts investing its funds in Cayman Islands. The associate companies will not be totally accountable to the Minister. I would suggest that all joint \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ventures, particularly where minority interests are taken, should be approved by the Minister so that they keep in line with the objectives of the POSB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would urge that, while the POSB must compete with existing banks in the provision of new services, great care must be taken especially in the provision of automated services. Where computer security is concerned, there have been lapses in this area and it is important that proper measures are taken to avoid such recurrences. The Public Accounts Committee has commented on this subject in its Third Report presented to this House on 27th August, 1983, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bearing in mind the vulnerable nature of computer operation the Committee recommends that POSB constantly review its security controls to maintain the highest standard of security at all times.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's assurance on computer security would be most welcome. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Amendment Bill. \n  <br>5.51 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Chau Sik Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Chau Sik Ting (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill. As explained by the Minister of State for Finance, the POSB should retain its unique role as a national savings bank by providing a convenient banking service for the personal depositor. The need to encourage thrift and mobilise domestic savings for public development is still as relevant today as it was when the POSB was first established. These objectives must continue to be pursued, POSB has performed creditably so far. But should POSB go commercial, it could lose sight of the needs and interests of its personal depositors and would therefore be diverted from its initial objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are glad to hear that POSB will offer personal current accounts, personal fixed deposits and sale of travellers' cheques. The public will certainly welcome these additional services. Commercial banks and finance companies must therefore continually ensure a high standard of personal services in view of the potential competition from the POSB. The public will benefit from such a competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, POSB remains severely restricted in its lending and investment policy and therefore should retain all its existing privileges, namely:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) exemption from income tax of interest earned on savings deposit; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) a Government guarantee of deposits; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) exemption from the provisions of the Banking Act, particularly the reserve requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should tax exemption on interest of savings deposit be discontinued, POSB would lose its inherent attractiveness to personal depositors. I am, moreover, in favour of payment of interest on POSB current accounts as it is in the interest of the public. The general public will welcome this. As to whether this move would lead to increased lending costs to commercial enterprises, in particular the small ones, since the banks would be deprived of the so-called \"free funds\", keen competition in the market-place may, however, dictate otherwise. After all, some commercial banks, such as DBS, are already paying interest on current accounts through something known as the Autosave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like the Minister of State for Finance to elaborate on clause 7 of the Post Office Savings Bank of Singapore (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the hon. Members for Chong Boon and Thomson for supporting this Bill and for their various suggestions and comments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, first of all, like to deal with the comments by the Member for Chong Boon. At the outset, may I assure the House that the personal depositors with POSB will continue to enjoy tax exemption on the interest which they earn from savings deposits with the POSB. This will continue to be the attraction of POSB. The attractiveness has perhaps been overstated because most of the depositors with POSB are, in fact, small savers who pay little or no tax. This exemption from tax will only extend to the saving deposits and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not to fixed deposit interest. In the case of current accounts raised by the Member for Thomson, the POSB is as yet undecided whether it will pay interest on current accounts. If it does so, the interest will be taxable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Member for Chong Boon is an appeal to POSB not to impose too many conditions in the operation of the current accounts. On this point, I would like to assure Members that the POSB always has the interest of the small saver in mind. POSB is still looking into this matter. In the interest of banking prudence, of course certain conditions may have to be set. For example, if an account holder has only $1 in his savings account, it will be very difficult for him to operate a current account but the assurance I have given is that the POSB will always have the interest of the small depositor in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon referred to the new section 5(h) of the Bill regarding the powers to participate in companies and so forth. May I refer him to another new section 5(A) of the Bill which imposes the restrictions on the Bank. If I may quote section 5A (1):- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the Bank shall not - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) through any company or undertaking do anything which the Bank is not authorised to do or is prohibited from doing.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>And section 5A (2) states as follows, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except as authorised by this Act, the Bank shall not engage in any commercial, industrial or financial undertaking or acquire any direct interest in the stocks or shares of any trading, industrial or financial company.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>So whatever it does, it must conform with the provisions of this Act. As I have said before, there are various rather severe restrictions placed on POSB to confine its role to those of a national savings bank, and not to go into the areas of commercial banking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, all the operations of the Bank, including its subsidiaries, are accountable to the Minister and both my Ministry and POSB will be extremely \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cautious to ensure that the Bank observes prudence in all its lending and investment activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank the Member for Chong Boon for raising the question of security of the automated services. This is a matter which the POSB is continually reviewing, and POSB will engage the assistance of experts, if necessary, to ensure proper security of its computer systems, the automated teller machines and so forth. As Members. are aware, I think there was one incident reported in the papers of theft from an ATM and the POSB has reviewed procedures and will continue to review procedures to prevent a recurrence of such an event. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now come to the points raised by the Member for Thomson. I fully agree with him, and it is the intent of this Bill, that the POSB should remain as the national savings bank with a special role to play in our economy. The Bank has done extremely well in this regard and should continue to do so. As the national savings bank, the POSB is fully justified in retaining its existing concessions, especially tax exemption on savings deposits and Government guarantee of all its deposits. With the existing high level of LDC debt and the concomitant risk of bank failures abroad, the Government guarantee of deposits in POSB offers depositors a safe haven for their hard-earned savings. However, these concessions must be seen in perspective in relation to POSB's role and objectives and the restrictions which have been placed on POSB. For example, in return for exemption from the provisions of the Banking Act, the POSB is required to hold at least 50% of its assets with the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will restrict the POSB severely in its lending and investment policy. The POSB is not free to accept deposits from corporate bodies or to engage in foreign exchange transactions and the financing of foreign trade. It will lend mainly to statutory boards and corporations wholly or mainly owned by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of weight has been placed on the tax exemption on savings deposit in attracting depositors. As I have said, this has been overstated to some extent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The POSB must also be commended for the imaginative and bold steps that it has taken to inculcate the savings habit. For example, it pioneered Giro and the computerization of savings transactions. Its marketing efforts have been targeted solely at the personal depositor. It has established a large number of branches throughout the country, in housing estates, in shopping centres and elsewhere. It keeps branches open on Saturday afternoons and selected branches open till \n  <br>7.00 pm. The POSB has generally been responsive to the needs of its depositors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson raised the question of the payment of interest on current accounts. As I have said, the POSB has not yet decided whether it will pay interest on current accounts. The Banking Act does not prohibit banks from paying interest on current accounts if they wish to do so. In addition, the MAS has not prohibited banks from paying interest on current accounts, and it does not intend to play a regulatory role in this matter. It is actually a restriction placed by the Association of Banks of Singapore on the banks themselves, and it is really up to the banks to decide whether in the interest of competition they should offer this facility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would just like to say a few words to clarify the nature of the protection under clause 7 of this Bill. Clause 7 of the Post Office Savings Bank of Singapore (Amendment) Bill will enable the Bank to enjoy protection accorded to bankers under the Bills of Exchange Act against liabilities in connection with the proposed operation of current accounts. Protection is provided in such instances as:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where a banker in good faith and in the ordinary course of business pays unindorsed or irregularly indorsed cheques; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where a banker in good faith and without negligence collects payments of cheques or certain other instruments for his customers who turned out to be not the true owners of these instruments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can explain this in simpler terms. You have a cheque book and you happen to lose it. Now, somebody uses it to write cheques, forging your signature or whatever. It is not possible for the bank to check \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> every signature, and if in good faith the bank pays this cheque to a third party, the paying bank is not liable under this clause; neither is the receiving bank liable. That is the meaning of this provision and it is normally accorded to all bankers. So the lesson is: Do keep your cheque books under lock and key. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>6.05 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1983\" to \"1984\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause I ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 8 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>6.06 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Factories Act, 1973 - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) firstly, to require medical supervision and examinations prescribed under the Act for workers to be carried out by persons who are trained in occupational medicine and registered with the Chief Inspector of Factories; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) secondly, to provide for more stringent requirements on the safety of workers who have to work at heights or at places where there is risk of drowning or asphyxiation; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) thirdly, to confer powers on the Chief Inspector of Factories to deal with unsafe conditions in factories; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) fourthly, to make improvements in the legislation in the light of experience gained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments are described in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill. I would like, however, to comment on some of the more important amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 62 of the Act, the Minister can make regulations to require medical supervision and examination of workers employed in occupations involving risks to health. Clause 16 of the Bill seeks to amend this provision to empower the Minister to make regulations to require the medical supervision and examination to be carried out by persons registered with the Chief Inspector of Factories and to prescribe the qualifications and conditions for such registration. Members will recall that the reasons for this have been fully explained on previous instances and I need not repeat the explanations again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it, however, Sir, to reiterate that many industrial diseases such as noise-induced deafness, silicosis, asbestosis and lead poisoning, develop gradually over a period of time. Although symptoms and signs may be minimal in the early stages, these diseases can, with progression, lead to physical disability or death. However, if regular medical examinations of workers exposed to such hazards are carried out, the diseases can be detected in their early stages and remedial action taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of confirmed cases of occupational diseases has been on the increase. It rose from 331 cases in 1973 to 760 in 1983. With the establishment of more industries using new chemicals, materials and processes, this number is expected to rise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, a pressing need for the health of workers who are engaged in occupations involving risks to health to be monitored closely. My Ministry will be introducing regulations to require such workers to undergo regular medical examinations and tests in accordance with the regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another major concern of my Ministry is the safety at construction sites. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accidents rate in the construction industry must be brought down. Every effort will have to be taken to improve safety in the sector in order to encourage our own citizens and residents to take up employment in the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is experiencing a construction boom. Unfortunately, there has also been a concomitant rise in the number of industrial accidents in the industry from 927 in 1980 to 1,916 in 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most common causes of accidents at construction sites is the failure by contractors to take adequate safety measures for workers who have to work at heights. In 1983 alone, there were 400 accidents involving workers falling from heights. The accidents resulted in 46 deaths. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present section 33 of the Act requires an occupier of a factory, which includes contractors at construction sites, to provide means such as safety belts and fencing if a worker is required to work at a place from which he is liable to fall at a distance of more than three metres and if the place does not afford a secure foothold and handhold. Most occupiers will provide safety belts to the workers even if their safety can be better ensured by providing footholds and handholds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 33 to make it mandatory for footholds and handholds to be provided. Safety belts or fencing can be provided only where it is demonstrated that it is impracticable to provide footholds and handholds. The clause also extends the requirements of the section to places from which workers are liable to fall or into any substance which can cause drowning or asphyxiation and prohibits any person from directing workers to work at such places unless the requirements of the section have been complied with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to draw attention of the House to clause 10 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Chief Inspector of Factories can issue an order under section 46 of the Act to prohibit the use of any part of the ways, works, machinery or plant in a factory if such use is likely to result in any of the dangers which are classified as dangerous occurrences in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another section, section 47 of the Act, allows the Minister to have powers to prohibit any work or process in a factory and to order an occupier to take steps to remove any danger to workers in a factory. The powers under this section 47 are wider and can be invoked when there is any risk to the safety, health or welfare of workers. The orders are issued upon a report by the Chief Inspector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, because of the limited powers of the Chief Inspector under section 46, even common infringements at construction worksites, such as the one which I mentioned earlier, and infringements relating to dangerous machines have to be referred to the Minister for an order to prohibit any work or process until the danger is removed. The issue of such orders involve considerations which are technical in nature. It will therefore be more expedient to transfer the powers of the Minister under section 47 of the Act to the Chief Inspector of Factories. This will enable the Chief Inspector of Factories to deal with any unsafe conditions in factories more swiftly. The amendment in clause 10 of the Bill is to give effect to this transfer of powers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>6.15 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to make a very small comment. I am in full agreement with the Minister on most of the clauses that he has mentioned except on clause 16. I would just like to caution him to weigh very carefully whether only a special category of doctors should be allowed to do this statutory medical examination. This examination, with proper guidance, is relatively simple and any MBBS doctor should be able to do it. Therefore, we must not allow only one group of doctors to do this examination or else we might create a cartel. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had to refresh my memory of the Budget debate last year in preparation for the Second Reading of this Bill, and so I am familiar with the very exhaustive debate which took place during the Budget debate where the hon. Member spoke and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expressed his criticisms of the factory designated doctor scheme. I am also aware that the then Minister for Labour had also given a very exhaustive reply upon which I could not possibly hope to improve. Suffice it for me to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, only two points. First, the hon. Member need not fear that this scheme will create a cartel because he and other medical practitioners are also free to enrol for the factory designated doctor course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to inform him that like him, other doctors had also initially expressed reservations about this scheme. But it would interest him and others to know that during the first course on occupational medicine which the National Productivity Board conducted, the NPB also conducted a survey amongst the 30 doctors who attended the course. 90% of them found the course useful to their work and 87% even said that they would recommend the course to fellow medical practitioners which, I think, proves that such training is indeed perceived to be useful and necessary even by those who initially had reservations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof S.

Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S.

I am really sorry the Member for Anson lost in a very democratic ballot and I would urge him to continue to try and not to seek special concessions for himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of SBC licence fees, let me at the outset refer to what the then Hon. Minister for Communications and Acting Minister for Culture said in moving the Second Reading of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation Rill in this House on 21st September 1979 and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The reason for converting RTS into a statutory body is to free the Department of Broadcasting from administrative and financial constraints so that the organisation can expand and develop into a lively radio and television station. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Broadcasting Corporation as a statutory body will have the authority and flexibility to recruit artistes, producers, script-writers, choreographers and other personnel, and to determine their emoluments, to improve and expand services, facilities and equipment, and to acquire new technology in accordance with the needs of the broadcasting services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial support from the Government is vital if the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation is to develop into a reputable organisation capable of producing good quality programmes. The Corporation, by its nature, performs a public service and cannot be entirely profit-oriented.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Broadcasting Corporaion is now in its fourth year of existence as a statutory board. With the policy, operational and financial flexibilities of a statutory board, one must assume that the SBC today is a better organization than its former self, Radio and TV Singapore (RTS). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I propose to examine only the financial performance of SBC. I am just confining myself to that. According to the SBC's published Annual Reports, the Board has been notching up significant surpluses since 1981. SBC's first fiscal year covered a period of 14 months from 1st February 1980 to 31st March 1981. For the year ending 31st March 1981, SBC had an operating income of $65.5 million with $50.4 million or 77% originating from advertising, $13.1 million or 20% from licence fees and $2 million or 3% from other income. In 1984, revenue from new licence fees would contribute about 33% of operating expenditure compared with 29% in 1983. With an operating expenditure of only $48.7 million, SBC recorded a surplus of $14.3 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, the operating income shot up to $78 million or an increase of 19% over 1981 while operating expenditure rose to $57.6 million, up 18%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the statistics, one cannot but conclude that the SBC has not only been very lively as the then Hon. Minister said when moving the Bill but extremely profitable. As at 31st March 1982, SBC had an accumulated surplus of $34.5 million. Moreover, one notices a hefty sum of $51.5 million sitting in fixed deposits in banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from these surpluses, with the revised licence fees, SBC is expected to earn another $11.2 million, further aggravating the burden of its existing surpluses. Incidentally, the additional income from the new rates alone would be adequate to finance the forthcoming Channel 12 which has an estimated annual operating cost of $3 million for about 3 1/2 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now look at the experience of other countries. I have taken the liberty of circulating a Table (Cols. 397 - 398) which shows the licence fees that are charged in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. From this Table we can make two significant inferences. First, in all these countries where TV stations are both commercially-sponsored and government-sponsored, the licence fees are either free or optional or distinctly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lower than the rates in Singapore. The only exception seems to be the United Kingdom where the licence fee is about $140 per annum compared with $80 in Singapore. Sir, with the o falling, we may catch up with them very quickly! \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1984/19840117/19840117-HA-0430397.htm\">Table - A COMPARISON OF CTV LICENCE FEE IN SELECTED COUNTRIES (Cols. 397 - 398)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other significant observation is that radio and television in these countries are financed by grants from governments or strictly from commercial advertisements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the figures I have given you, it is clear that SBC has to find better and more innovative ways of financing its operations. To my mind, the options open are broadly as follows:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It has to improve its productivity through manpower training and upgrading, thus reducing expenditure. I have no doubt that SBC will continue to step up its efforts in this direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increase its revenue from commercials. Sir, here I would commend the SBC for its proposal to introduce what has been dubbed as \"prime-time advertising\" within the peak newscast periods. According to a newspaper report, this innovation of introducing commercial breaks into its daily English and Mandarin news bulletins is expected to rake in an additional $15 million per annum for SBC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The third option is of course to increase licence fees. Here, I am afraid that SBC has succumbed to the \"soft option\" of passing the buck to the consumers without exhausting the other potential sources of revenue, particularly TV commercials. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the financial cost and the manpower incurred to administer and collect licence fees, apart from the cost incurred by the law enforcement agencies to police the scheme. At this juncture, I would like to make the point that the SBC is a state monopoly and should avoid the temptation to resort to price increases at the slightest opportunity. Perhaps it should take note of other statutory boards like Telecoms, including the PUB, where savings from technological advances and oil price fluctuations have been passed on immediately to consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Sir, the fourth option is to allow for some form of limited competition. At the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> moment, there is some form of competition from a neighbouring country. In fact, Singaporeans can own a colour television and watch TV programmes without having to switch on to SBC. Consumer feedback suggests that some of these foreign programmes are quite good. Perhaps SBC might want to give such consumers a discount on the existing licence fees! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me refer again to the Table and examine the competitive co-existence of both government-sponsored as well as commercially-sponsored radio and TV stations or channels in those countries. We can form the following inferences again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The general indication is that such a limited competition has compelled both sectors to be efficient in terms of producing better programmes for the consumers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) It is generally accepted that competitive co-existence between government and commercial broadcasting does not necessarily undermine specific or general national and governmental objectives or priorities. The Hong Kong Commercial TV, for example, is a case in point. In both cases, conditions have been laid whereby the station must dedicate a certain amount of air time for public affairs and educational programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting, Sir, that commercialization will solve all our problems. Neither am I suggesting that we allow free market forces to run wild. Rather, I am merely proposing that we study the feasibility of introducing some form of competition to further enhance SBC's efficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Apart from the element of competition, an alternative commercial arrangement could bring in financial advantages. For example, corporate taxes from a commercial station or channel could be used to cross-subsidize SBC's expenditure. Moreover, if SBC were to lease one of its channels or existing channels to the private sector, then the revenue could offset SBC's operating deficit or reduce the extent of Government subsidy. \n  <br>6.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, however, that there is a strong case for a certain amount of Government subsidy for an intangible \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> service like radio and TV broadcasting. The key issues are to ensure the efficient use of public funds and to reduce the direct financial burden of Government and the indirect burden on the wage earner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to just comment that over the last six to eight months, Singaporeans have been subjected to a spate of price increases from the Government sector. It would appear that the Government was the pace-setter for our domestic inflation. In fact, many of my constituents have even suggested that the income tax reliefs granted over the years have now been more than offset by the various price increases. No one, I must concede, quarrels with some of the price hikes associated with specific Government policies, such as car population control. However, increases in SBC's licence fees do not appear to go down too well with the grassroots. One can think of several reasons for this adverse grassroots reaction towards price increases. One possibility could be the speed and proximity within which the various increases were implemented. This \"batching together\" has understandably created a sense of anxiety over perceived falling standards of living. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, may I suggest, Sir, that the Government monitor closely all proposals for price increases, specifically those by Government departments and statutory boards. Taken by itself, certain price hikes or proposals can be justified. However, unless there is some form of coordination, the cumulative burden of a series of price hikes within a short period of time can create a lot of anxieties, especially among the lower income groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, Sir, I would like to add that the interests of our consumers have not been totally neglected. Here, I would like to commend the Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) for coming out openly to protest, for the first time, against a major Government price increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Culture (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to thank the Member for Chong Boon for bringing up this matter because it gives me an opportunity to explain the recent TV and Radio licence fee increases. The broadcasting service that SBC provides is a public service much like other public services. The cost of operating this public service must be borne by the beneficiaries. In the case of SBC, the beneficiaries are the listeners and the viewers and the advertising clients. It is true that SBC has accumulated a surplus and that this surplus has been achieved in spite of major organizational changes, massive inputs of personnel in administration, programme production, technical areas, recruitment of performing talents as well as very substantial investments in engineering facilities and in premises. For example, the personnel employed by SBC now stands at about 2,600 compared to 1,300 when SBC was established and took over the staff and facilities from RTS. New equipment and facilities of more than $30 million has been invested. TV output, since SBC was established, has increased from 104 hours a week to 116 hours a week. But what is even more significant is that local production of TV programmes increased from 26 1/2 hours a week to 42 1/2 hours a week. When SBC was established local production accounted for 27% of all telecast and now local production accounts for 37%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since TV licence fees have not increased since 1978, these increases have obviously been funded from other sources and SBC certainly did not resort to any soft option or to increasing licence fees at the first opportunity, as suggested by the Member for Chong Boon, Firstly, SBC has been successful in increasing advertising revenue which accounted for 65% of SBC's total revenue. This figure is before the increase in revenue as a result of the licence fee increases. Rates for commercials have been increased four times since January 1980. Advertising revenue has increased from about $20 million in the fiscal year 1979/80 to $72 million in the fiscal year 1983/84, the last figure, of course, is an estimated figure. This increase has been possible because of better programmes, improved scheduling and strong sales effort to optimize air time sales for programmes that draw a large viewership, or in the case of radio, listener- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ship. Innovative and aggressive marketing increased SBC's share of the total advertising expenditure in Singapore from 26% in 1979 to 29% in the last fiscal year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major source of funds for SBC has been Government grants, and this was as agreed by the government when SBC was established. All new investments have been funded by Government grants. Government has approved an allocation of $67 million, since SBC was established, to fund various capital projects. In addition, as agreed again when SBC was established, all replacement of old equipment is for the account of SBC. Since SBC was established, it has spent $12 1/2 million to replace old equipment. I must point out that the replacement of much of the equipment cost more than the original cost of the equipment which SBC took over from RTS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sources of revenue have also been explored. SBC set up a Commercial Production Unit to produce commercials which were produced on tape instead of the more expensive method of producing them on film. These taped commercials are, of course, used over SBC. The Corporation also set up a Publications Unit. These two units have contributed $4 to $5 million per year to SBC's revenue. Thus it is not true that SBC has increased its fee at the slightest opportunity. All these measures which SBC has taken will continue to be pursued and SBC will constantly look for new sources of revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then have we increased licence fees, especially in the light of the fact that SBC has surpluses? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we cannot assume that revenues will continue to increase. Costs will increase with improvements in programmes. Costs of manpower and talent and acquired programmes will increase. I have already pointed out that replacement costs of much of the equipment will be much more than the original cost at which they were taken over by SBC. As SBC acquires better and better programmes from abroad, costs are bo(ind to increase. As an example, Sir, the Singapore public likes to have attractive feature films during holidays. SBC used to telecast films that cost $2,000 to $3,000 per film. Lately, we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have tried to purchase or lease more up-to-date films, and this can cost as much as $15,000 to $20,000 each. This money, of course, has to come from somewhere. Members must note that whether one person watches a programme or 10 million watch a programme, the cost of telecasting is the same. But the revenue varies according to viewership. This is limited by the size of the population. In the case of Singapore this small population is further restricted by being segmented into four language groups. So the potential for revenue is not as great as in many other countries. Further, if we want to maintain a balance between popular entertainment programmes and programmes of high educational, informative and cultural content, the scope for advertising revenue must be limited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prudent controls have enabled a reserve fund to be built up by SBC. Given the slow world economic recovery and if the trend in the rate of growth of expenditure outpacing the rate of growth of income continues, SBC's reserves will soon be depleted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the parties involved in broadcasting have had to pay more. Advertisers have paid more. SBC has paid more in purchasing foreign programmes as well as in the production of local programmes. Only the viewer has had his fees at a constant level since 1979 for TV; and since 1938 for Radio. Any further delay in revising the Radio and TV licence fees will simply mean that when the revision is actually done, the increase will be so substantial that it will give rise to a hue and cry. It is preferable all round if the necessary revision in the fees were made in periodic and gradual steps. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TV licence fee must, of course, be seen in proper perspective. The fee of $80 per year for colour TV, for example, means 22 cents per day. And what does the viewer get for his 22 cents a day? He gets a choice of 17 hours of TV, 93 hours of Radio and 200 pages of SBC Text. I think, by any criteria this is very good value for money. Singaporeans are not hesitant about spending money on entertainment. It is estimated that about one-third of the households in Singapore have video tape recorders. It costs $5 to $8 to rent a feature \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> film or serial of only 1 1/2 to 3 hours. And many are spending $40 to $100 a month to hire video cassettes. So I cannot understand this wringing of hands over 22 cents per day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, we have not increased the fee for monochrome TV sets, or black and white TV sets. For those who own black and white TV sets to be considered as the poor who need special treatment speaks very much about how far Singaporeans have come in their expectations of what they ought to have. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has quoted licence fees of other countries. This game of comparison, of course, can be played by more than one without any conclusive results. I can quote that apart from the UK, the fee in Italy is $118, in Denmark it is $250, in Austria it is $203. These are all countries With a larger viewership and thus have a larger advertising revenue potential. So we cannot really prove anything by making these comparisons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the penultimate point that the Member for Chong Boon made, ie, the introduction of commercial station in order to have some competition, I will not deny that competition can increase efficiency and improve productivity and even generate new ideas in radio and TV broadcasting in Singapore. But that is only one side of the coin. The main factor in Singapore is a limited market and very limited supply of talent. Two stations competing for programmes from overseas, including direct telecast of important events, will only increase costs, not quality. For example, two stations competing for the FA Cup Final or the Wimbledon Final will mean that finally at the end of the day we pay more but we are not going to get anything more than one Final for paying more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for the expertise and talent. An increase in cost will not necessarily mean an increase in supply or quality. Hong Kong was mentioned as an example of a place which has more than \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> one TV station competing on a commercial basis. In Hong Kong there was, in fact, a Third TV company which went into receivership, and Hong Kong has a much larger population than Singapore and virtually a monolingual market. Even with foreign capital and expertise, one of the remaining two companies in Hong Kong is barely able to stay afloat. I am sure Members must have read some of these things in the newspapers. What is even more significant is that cut-throat competition in Hong Kong television has led to programmes that are increasingly difficult for us to accept in Singapore. It is because of this that we have to place special emphasis on building up our Chinese drama production unit in SBC. Even in serious programmes,, for example in America, when it comes to News and other informational programmes, because of severe competition, there is a tendency to indulge in sensationalism and to attempt to be hypocritical of every move by the Government in order to attract viewer attention - all to the detriment of the society. If commercial considerations are paramount, there is no doubt about the quality of programmes that we will get. Members have just to look at the kind of films screened in our theatres and the kind of films that have long runs and they will have an idea of the quality of the films that will be featured if commercial considerations are paramount. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of TV as a media is immense. The cumulative effect of sustained weekly programming of popular TV shows that can deliver mass audiences to the advertisers must mean that shows will appeal more and more to baser tastes. This is one of the unfortunate effects of making commercial considerations the paramount consideration. Such a development will completely negate the kind of values which are relevant to our survival and progress. I would therefore not favour at the present juncture a private commercial channel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point made by the Member for Chong Boon is about the series of increases as a result of Government decision. I want to assure the Member that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> no increase by Government or a statutory body is introduced without thorough consideration. In fact, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has to first study each increase for its impact on the cost of living before it is approved. And the Ministry of Trade and Industry continues to monitor such increases and the consequences of these increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Thirteen\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   minutes to Seven o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PUBLICATION OF 1983 'O' LEVEL RESULTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BY SUBJECT GROUPING</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (a) What is the insuperable difficulty that his Ministry may face in giving the 'O' level results for the following grouping of subjects: (i) English, (ii) English and Mathematics, (iii) English, Mathematics and the Second Language; and (b) if there is no insuperable difficulty, will he direct his Ministry to prepare an analysis of the results obtained by students from government and government-aided schools in the subjects as grouped in this question in the 1983 'O' level examinations and make them public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tay Eng Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tay Eng Soon:</b> There is no insuperable difficulty to compute the results requested by the Member for Anson - only that it costs time and money. The data requested by the Member for Anson will cost the taxpayer $1,300 to extract. Unless the information serves a clear purpose, the Ministry does not carry out analyses of the type requested as there is great pressure on computer time for priority work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson can readily estimate the results he requires from the data provided to him on 20 Dec 1983. The passing rates for the subject combinations can be easily estimated by making use of a well-known probability formula. Thus, for example, given that the passing rate for EL1 and Maths C are 43.8% and 73.3% respectively (in 1982), the passing rate for EL1 and Maths C taken together is around 32% (i.e. 43.8% X 73.3%). But in fact there is a positive correlation between passing EL1 and Maths and in this case the combined pass rate is higher at around 38%. The passing rate for EL1, Maths C and CL2 taken together can be similarly estimated. The main point is that EL1 is the weakest subject and hence any subject grouping including EL1 would be pulled down by the EL1 results. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MEALS FOR CLASS 'C' PATIENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Health whether (a) under the new scale of hospital fees Class 'C' patients will only be charged for meals actually taken by them whilst in hospital or will they be charged a flat rate as under the previous scale regardless of whether they take their meals from the hospital or not; and (b) patients will be allowed to have food brought from their homes if they think the cost of meals at the hospitals is prohibitive for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Howe Yoon Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Howe Yoon Chong:</b> Class 'C' patients who are supplied with food by the hospitals are charged a daily meal fee of $5. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients, other than those ordered by the doctor to be on special diets, can have food brought from their homes. Where no food is supplied, there will not be any charge. The option will be on an \"all or none\" basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients on special diets will be charged the normal fee. Those who are specifically not provided with any food at all for medical reasons and those in Intensive Care Units will not be levied the fee for the number of days when no food is supplied. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PURCHASE OF E-2C PLANES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

New aircraft take 3-4 years to deliver, and another 2 years of training to attain operational status. We must continually maintain our air defence capability to ensure Singapore's security in a world of constant turmoil. The F16 is one of the aircraft being considered by our Air Force for the late 1980's and 1990's.
