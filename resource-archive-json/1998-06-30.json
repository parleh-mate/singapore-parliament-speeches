More workers have been  retrenched.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  jobs  lost was in labour intensive  and  low-skill\r\n\r\nareas.  On the other hand, new jobs created tend to be of higher\r\n\r\nvalue added and require higher level of skills.  For example, in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector, the $8.5 billion of  committed  fixed\r\n\r\nasset  investments will generate some 20,000 new jobs  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years.  Most of these new investments such  as  wafer\r\n\r\nfab,   petrochemical  and  telecommunications,  require  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  with  NTC certification.  The demand for  workers  with\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  specialised  skills  includes  more  than  2,000\r\n\r\nengineers,  2,000 diploma holders and 3,000 NTC II  holders  for\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the shift in demand to higher skill jobs, we\r\n\r\nface  a real danger of a mismatch in the skills required by  the\r\n\r\nemployers  and what our workers can do.  Structural unemployment\r\n\r\nwill  be  the outcome if nothing is done.  This problem must  be\r\n\r\ntackled  by retraining and skills upgrading, especially for  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  Hence, the Government has committed $50 million\r\n\r\nin  addition  to  the Skills Development Fund's $50  million  to\r\n\r\nexpand the outreach of the Skills Redevelopment Programme  which\r\n\r\nis  targeted at upgrading workers' skills so that they can  cope\r\n\r\nwith the changes.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced\r\n\r\nanother  $20 million for a Skills Development Centre.  The  $120\r\n\r\nmillion  Skills Redevelopment Programme will be able to  provide\r\n\r\nskills upgrading for up to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n40,000  workers.  If every worker makes a determined  effort  to\r\n\r\nraise  his or her skill level, we will be able to close the  gap\r\n\r\nand rid the consequences of structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  how  long has this retraining programme  been  in\r\n\r\nplace?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme  was first launched  in  December  1996\r\n\r\nunder   the  auspices  of  the  NTUC,  the  Singapore   National\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Federation  (SNEF)  and  the  Government.    Several\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments or statutory boards were involved.   EDB\r\n\r\nand  PSB  were  very much involved in the pilot  phase  of  this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How is it, may I ask, that we still\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  have this gap between the skills  needed  and  the\r\n\r\nskills that our workers can provide?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have quite a large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  older  workers, aged 40 and  above,  who  have  less\r\n\r\neducation because, in their younger days, education was  not  so\r\n\r\nfreely and readily available.  This is the group of workers that\r\n\r\nare most in need of skills upgrading.  Skills upgrading needs  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  more time.  We cannot just wave a  magic  wand  and\r\n\r\novernight  we  have 400,000 or 500,000 workers who are  suddenly\r\n\r\nturned   into   skilled   workers.   So  although   the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme was launched in December 1996,  it  will\r\n\r\ntake  us quite a few years to reach out to all the older workers\r\n\r\nto help them to upgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister,  besides the skills qualification, does the Government\r\n\r\nexpect  any mismatch in terms of the graduates from polytechnics\r\n\r\nand universities?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's group of\r\n\r\ngraduates  may experience a more difficult time getting  a  job,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  have  said  before  that some of the graduates  who  are  too\r\n\r\nfastidious or waiting for the ideal job to come around may  find\r\n\r\nthat  they have to wait quite a while.  So the advice  is  that,\r\n\r\nfor  a  new graduate entering the job market for the first time,\r\n\r\nwhether  he is a polytechnic graduate or a university  graduate,\r\n\r\nhe  should  try to get a job as soon as possible, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the offer is and, even if it is not his ideal job,  it  is\r\n\r\nstill better to have a job and be employed and take the time  to\r\n\r\nlearn  the  ropes than to stay unemployed because  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  is not very good.  There is a sharp slowdown  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.  Many companies are not expanding  their  head\r\n\r\ncount even at the higher end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, there are still some sectors, whether\r\n\r\nit is in the manufacturing or service sector, which are still in\r\n\r\nneed  of more senior and experienced or even graduate employees,\r\n\r\nand  these are the companies that will be recruiting.   In  some\r\n\r\ncases, they may even find that they have difficulty getting  the\r\n\r\nnumber of skilled workers that they need from among our pool  of\r\n\r\ngraduates.

First, there is a big difference in season  parking\r\n\r\ncharges for heavy vehicle parks.  The HDB and URA charge between\r\n\r\n$60  and  $120  per  month.   In  comparison,  the  charges  for\r\n\r\nequivalent private heavy vehicle parks are between $160 and $180\r\n\r\nper  month.      Second,  there is also a big  mismatch  in  the\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand.  There is currently very strong demand  for\r\n\r\nheavy vehicle lots within 3 km of housing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestates.   URA manages some 4,300 of such lots within  3  km  of\r\n\r\nhousing  estates,  but  has  a  waiting  list  of  nearly  2,500\r\n\r\napplicants.   In  contrast, there are some 6,000  heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nlots  outside  the  3 km radius operated by the  private  sector\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  taken  up.  So there is a  need  to  make  some\r\n\r\nadjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st July 1998, the season parking charges\r\n\r\nfor  public heavy vehicle  parks within 3 km of housing  estates\r\n\r\nwill  be  revised to between $65 and $130, an increase  of  only\r\n\r\nbetween  $5  and $10. This is the first revision in nine  years.\r\n\r\nThis  revision is necessary to meet these two mismatches,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave explained earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether the URA can lower the parking\r\n\r\ncharges  for  under-utilised  URA  heavy  vehicle  parking  lots\r\n\r\noutside  the  3  km  radius.   There  is,  in  fact,  no  under-utilisation of URA heavy vehicle lots outside the 3  km  radius.\r\n\r\nOut  of  the  6,000 heavy vehicle lots outside this radius  that\r\n\r\nare  not taken up, only 77 are URA lots.  So URA pricing  is  at\r\n\r\nthe right level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, would the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain  how  does the increase in season parking charges  solve\r\n\r\nthe problem of mismatch?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If we have 4,000 lots and there are\r\n\r\nanother 2,500 on the waiting list, obviously, the price  is  too\r\n\r\nlow  for  the lots within 3 km of the housing estates.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  there are 6,000 lots outside the 3 km radius  which\r\n\r\nare  under-utilised.  So we have to adjust the prices of the URA\r\n\r\nlots  nearer town and we hope the private sector will lower  the\r\n\r\ncharges of the lots outside the 3 km radius.  Then there will be\r\n\r\na better matching of supply and demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the mismatch may not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  due  to  price factors but due to the location of the  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicle  parks, because it would be more convenient for  vehicle\r\n\r\nowners or drivers to park their vehicles near their homes, which\r\n\r\nare normally in the HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Obviously, being nearer the housing\r\n\r\nestates is more convenient and therefore a person should  pay  a\r\n\r\nhigher  price  for  that convenience.   So,  today,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where if a driver is lucky to get a lot  in  the  URA\r\n\r\nheavy  vehicle parks within 3 km of housing estates, he  pays  a\r\n\r\nlower  price.   And those who cannot get a lot  will  just  wait\r\n\r\nforever for a lot.  If a person is unlucky to get a lot, then he\r\n\r\npays  a higher price further away from his housing estate.  This\r\n\r\nis not a sensible way to run heavy vehicle parks.  So we need to\r\n\r\nmake the adjustment - URA to raise its charges a little and  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to lower their charges a little.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister not think that to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem  of heavy vehicle parks  and  also  for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience of the drivers, the answer should be to  build  more\r\n\r\nheavy  vehicle parks near HDB estates, rather than  raising  the\r\n\r\nprice?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We do build heavy vehicle lots but there\r\n\r\nis a premium on land within the housing estates.  And this is  a\r\n\r\nhistorical  situation where drivers of heavy vehicles  have  got\r\n\r\nused  to the convenience of driving their heavy vehicles  within\r\n\r\nthe  housing  estates and sometimes park in the private  housing\r\n\r\nestates next to the HDB estates.  As Members will remember  some\r\n\r\n7-8  years  ago,  we  made it mandatory  for  them  to  park  in\r\n\r\ndesignated lots and not park illegally along public roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an anomaly. If one is a driver of a tour bus, he\r\n\r\nis  not  allowed  to bring his tour bus to his  housing  estate.\r\n\r\nThere are designated parking lots for tour buses.  Similarly, if\r\n\r\na  person  is a driver of an SBS or TIBS bus, he does not  drive\r\n\r\nhis  bus to his housing estate.  But for heavy vehicles, we have\r\n\r\nthis historical practice and therefore we are slowly moving away\r\n\r\nfrom this practice, and requiring the heavy vehicle  drivers  to\r\n\r\npark  their  heavy  vehicles either in the  factory  or  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  estate where their vehicles are operating  and  then\r\n\r\ntake public transport back to their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I understand\r\n\r\nthat many lorry drivers work in shifts and they sometimes finish\r\n\r\nwork  very late.

Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nlook  into  the issue of how to improve the transportation  from\r\n\r\nthe  heavy  vehicle parks to the HDB estates?   I  believe  that\r\n\r\npeople  choose the nearby heavy vehicle parks because  they  can\r\n\r\nride  their bikes to their homes.  If it is more than 5  km,  it\r\n\r\nprobably takes an hour to ride the bike home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Chuang is right. We are beginning to\r\n\r\nsee  more and more lorry drivers installing bikes on their heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles, especially on a prime mover, and this makes a  lot  of\r\n\r\nsense.  If a driver is operating on a late night shift, he parks\r\n\r\nin the industrial estate nearest his home and he cycles home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no way that we can meet the demand for a\r\n\r\nlorry  driver  to have his lorry parked next to  his  home.   It\r\n\r\ncauses a lot of inconvenience.  They start up their vehicles  at\r\n\r\n5  am  and they disturb the estate.  So we have to have properly\r\n\r\ndesignated  heavy vehicle lots, both within our housing  estates\r\n\r\nas  well  as  outside the housing estates, and  let  the  market\r\n\r\npricing  mechanism  settle  the preferences  of  individuals  on\r\n\r\nwherever they want to park.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that it is\r\n\r\nfor  the Ministry's convenience to settle the issue and to solve\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of heavy vehicle parking lots by just raising  the\r\n\r\nseason  parking charges on the pretext that there is a  mismatch\r\n\r\nrather  than solving the problem by building more season parking\r\n\r\nparks  within 3 km of HDB estates?

When he says within 3 km, he  is  talking\r\n\r\nabout  right in the middle of his housing estate.   Most  of  us\r\n\r\nhave  constituencies where heavy vehicle parks  are  within  our\r\n\r\nhousing estates, and it is not possible to find more and more of\r\n\r\nsuch places.

Our costs of operating these  heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nparks  have gone up and we are making a small adjustment up  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  hoping  the  private sector  will  also  make  a  small\r\n\r\nadjustment  down,  and  then the market  can  work  its  way  to\r\n\r\nallocate the supply and demand appropriately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the Minister considered building\r\n\r\nmulti-storey heavy vehicle parks?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> In which case, the charges would double.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Calculation of B2 ward fee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Health whether\r\n\r\nhe  will  explain how the full cost of $142.00 for a day's  ward\r\n\r\nfee   for  B2  wards  in  the  Singapore  General  Hospital   is\r\n\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  $142  quoted  by Mr Jeyaretnam  is  the  daily  cost\r\n\r\nincurred by SGH in 1993 to provide the basic ward facilities and\r\n\r\nservices  for each B2 patient.

What I had hoped to get from the  Minister  was\r\n\r\nnot  in percentage terms but actual breakdown of how is it  that\r\n\r\nit  costs the Government $142 to maintain a single bed in a ward\r\n\r\nconsisting, I am told, of six beds every day.  How does it  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government $142?  May we have actual figures?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, obviously, Mr Jeyaretnam does not\r\n\r\nunderstand operational costs and how they are allocated.  I will\r\n\r\ngive  him  the figures and I hope the figures do not boggle  his\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indirect manpower costs include the salaries of staff\r\n\r\nworking  in  the  support departments which are not  within  the\r\n\r\nward,  because the daily cost is not the cost of just supporting\r\n\r\nthe  six beds in the ward.  There are a lot of other costs  that\r\n\r\nare necessary to support those six patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, indirect salary cost, the support staff including\r\n\r\nstaff  supporting the facilities, plant and engineering, medical\r\n\r\nrecords,  infection  control which is very  important;  we  have\r\n\r\nstaff checking the infection level to make sure that patients go\r\n\r\nin   and   do  not  get  infected  by  other  people;   hospital\r\n\r\nadministration, all these come to $43 per patient  day.   Direct\r\n\r\nsalary  of  nurses and health attendants within the  ward,  this\r\n\r\ncomes  to  $40  per day.  Depreciation and temporary  occupation\r\n\r\nlicence  fee comes to $18 per day.  Food services, $7.   Laundry\r\n\r\nand  linen, this comes to $4.50 a day.  Overhead costs comes  to\r\n\r\n$29  per  day.   Overhead  costs would be  things  like  patient\r\n\r\nbilling, medical records, maintenance, security, maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  common areas, because the hospital does not just constitute\r\n\r\nthat  room  where the patient is in, but a lot of  other  common\r\n\r\nareas.   So  all  these costs amount to $29.  As a  result,  the\r\n\r\ntotal daily cost to look after one patient in the B2 wards comes\r\n\r\nto $142.50.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister talks of\r\n\r\nsupporting  services  and records.

For me to try to give  all  the\r\n\r\ndata here would take days.  SGH has a workforce of almost 5,000,\r\n\r\ndivided into hundreds of categories.  Does he mean that he wants\r\n\r\nme  to give him the precise cost per category, the precise  cost\r\n\r\nof  each employee, how the cost is being allocated to the A, B1,\r\n\r\nB2  and  class  C patients?

Depreciation of what?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it costs about $300 million to\r\n\r\nbuild  a medium size hospital, let alone a hospital the size  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  General Hospital.  If he understands  anything  about\r\n\r\naccounts, he will realise that equipment which you purchase have\r\n\r\nto  be depreciated.  That is what the depreciation costs are all\r\n\r\nabout.   After  you have depreciated all these  facilities,  you\r\n\r\nallocate that cost to A, B1, B2 and Class C patients.  There are\r\n\r\ncertain  formulae which are adopted on cost allocations.   As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  have the manpower costs, which amount to 60%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May we have the rough figures of manpower\r\n\r\nemployed and their wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> If Mr Jeyaretnam would like to file a\r\n\r\nspecific  question, I would be very happy to give them  to  him.\r\n\r\nThis is because the cost data of SGH\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomes  to  a  good sized booklet and I do not think I  would  be\r\n\r\ndoing  Members  here any favour by spending the whole  one  hour\r\n\r\njust reading through the cost accounting records of SGH.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, you could hand it out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister explain the\r\n\r\nprinciple of allocation of costs to the various classes of wards\r\n\r\nin  terms  of indirect manpower cost, depreciation and  overhead\r\n\r\ncosts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> As I have just mentioned to Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam,  there are various formulae which are adopted.   The\r\n\r\nformula  varies from category to category.  For example,  direct\r\n\r\nlabour.  Direct labour is a direct costing, ie, if that ward has\r\n\r\nan  average of, let us say, 20 nurses, then the cost of those 20\r\n\r\nnurses  will  be  fully accounted for by that ward.   There  are\r\n\r\nother  things  which  are indirect.  For  example,  the  Medical\r\n\r\nRecords Office.  How is that cost allocated to A, B1, B2 and  C?\r\n\r\nBecause the Medical Records Office serves every patient,  it  is\r\n\r\nallocated in proportion to the number of patient days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the common areas, the maintenance cost of the common\r\n\r\nareas would be allocated in terms of the actual area occupied by\r\n\r\nthe  B2  ward.  There are certain things which are allocated  in\r\n\r\nterms  of the area occupied by the B2 wards.  Certain costs  are\r\n\r\nallocated  in  terms  of  patient usage and  certain  costs  are\r\n\r\nallocated  based  on  the  intensity  of  care.   So  there  are\r\n\r\ndifferent formulae that apply to each of the cost factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister satisfied that the\r\n\r\nformula  so  far  that  has been adopted is  fair  to  the  cost\r\n\r\nallocation of lower class wards such as C class and B2?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, all these cost allocation formulae\r\n\r\nhave  been  arrived  at after much discussion with  professional\r\n\r\nauditors and cost accountants and we stand guided by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister tell us how many nurses\r\n\r\nand  sisters are allocated to one B2 ward or do they serve other\r\n\r\nB2 wards as well in the vicinity?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the nurses are normally direct\r\n\r\ncosts, ie, the B2 wards will have perhaps 50 patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> B2 wards have only 6 patients per ward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> You are talking of per room. But the\r\n\r\nwhole  ward may have 50 beds or, in that case, maybe 54 beds  or\r\n\r\n48  beds.  I  do  not know what is the full complement  of  ward\r\n\r\nnurses.  As I said, there are 5,000 over staff in SGH, and I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a walking encyclopedia.  It is not my job to know the exact\r\n\r\nfigures anyway, unless Mr Jeyaretnam specifically asks for them.\r\n\r\nTaking a figure out of the air, if that ward has a complement of\r\n\r\n50  nurses, then the cost of those 50 nurses would be divided by\r\n\r\n48  beds or 54 beds, and that becomes a direct cost.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  costs which, as I have said just now, are indirect costs.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Medical Records Office.  There, they have maybe\r\n\r\n20  staff.   Then  the salary cost of those  20  staff  will  be\r\n\r\nallocated  over  all  the hospital beds.  This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nassumption is that each patient, whether he is in B1,  B2  or  C\r\n\r\nclass,  has the same access requirements to the Medical  Records\r\n\r\nOffice. Therefore, they are what we call \"allocated costs\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, would you like to ask your next\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If it pleases you, Sir.

There are means, in  fact,\r\n\r\nfree  means,  by  which an aggrieved person who feels  that  his\r\n\r\nrights  have  been  violated,  or  that  he  has  been  unfairly\r\n\r\ndiscriminated, can seek recourse.

If  left\r\n\r\nunattended  to, it may lead to major disruptions.  For  example,\r\n\r\nnon-Y2K  compliant  cash registers may not accept  credit  cards\r\n\r\nwhich expire in the year 2000 or after.  To avoid such problems,\r\n\r\nNCB  is  working  closely with other Government agencies,  trade\r\n\r\nassociations  and  professional  bodies  to  highlight  the  Y2K\r\n\r\nproblem  and encounrage companies to take the necessary  actions\r\n\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government agencies have been directed to complete the\r\n\r\nconversion of their affected systems by the end of this year  to\r\n\r\nallow a clear one-year lead time for further testing before  the\r\n\r\nturn  of the century. To-date, about 40% of the conversion  work\r\n\r\nhas  been completed.  Most Government agencies will be  able  to\r\n\r\nmeet the end-1998 deadline.\r\n\r\n.    In general, our private sector is aware of the Y2K problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, survey results indicate that there are still many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies, and even specific sectors, which are uncertain of the\r\n\r\nimpact of Y2K on their operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB) conducted an IT Manpower\r\n\r\nand  Skills Inventory Survey in October last year.  A  total  of\r\n\r\n269   companies   responded.   About  122  companies   (45%   of\r\n\r\nrespondents) stated that the Y2K problem was of concern to them.\r\n\r\nOf  these  122  respondents, 54% were already in  the  planning,\r\n\r\nbudgeting and impact analysis stages of tackling the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another survey conducted by the Singapore Federation of\r\n\r\nthe  Computer Industry (SFCI) in February 1998, 64% of  the  347\r\n\r\nrespondent organisations indicated that they are affected by the\r\n\r\nY2K  problem.   Another 25% indicated that they are  unaffected,\r\n\r\nwhile the remaining 11% said that they are not sure.  The survey\r\n\r\nalso  found  that  finance companies, public  organisations  and\r\n\r\nlarger  institutions  are the most affected  while  construction\r\n\r\ncompanies and smaller companies appear to be the most unsure  of\r\n\r\nthe impact of this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help push for early resolution of the problem, NCB has\r\n\r\nrequested  all  Government agencies to closely monitor  the  key\r\n\r\ninfrastructure companies under their supervision.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) has to ensure\r\n\r\nthat all the telecommunications operators, like SingTel, M1, are\r\n\r\nY2K-ready.  Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\r\n\r\nhas  issued guidelines to all financial institutions  to  review\r\n\r\ntheir  computer systems and to complete their Y2K conversion  by\r\n\r\nend of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the launch of the Y2K Conversion Campaign in November\r\n\r\n1996, NCB has been working with the various Government agencies,\r\n\r\ntrade associations and professional bodies to organise seminars,\r\n\r\nconferences  and exhibitions.  These serve to promote  awareness\r\n\r\nof  the Y2K problem, especially among the small and medium-sized\r\n\r\nenterprises  (SMEs).   For  example,  there  are  bi-monthly  IT\r\n\r\nAwareness  Briefings  for SMEs.  Further awareness  of  the  Y2K\r\n\r\nproblem is also built up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  press coverage on television, radio and  in  print,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the Chinese-language media.

There are no provisions in these  two  Acts  for\r\n\r\nanyone  to  exempt  himself from the requirements  for  whatever\r\n\r\nreason.

He\r\n\r\nwill be charged and punished accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service is vital to the security of a small\r\n\r\ncountry  like  Singapore.  Whereas some  States  may  choose  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a standing army, for a small country like  Singapore,\r\n\r\ncompulsory  military  service is the only  way  to  build  up  a\r\n\r\ncredible national defence force.  Our citizens must be ready and\r\n\r\nprepared to defend the country.  There is no other alternative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service works in Singapore because of its\r\n\r\nuniversality.    For   this  reason,  all   male   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  race  or religion, are required  by  law  to  do\r\n\r\nNational  Service  to defend our country.  All Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ntreated  equally  before  the law.   No  Singaporean  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  cite any reason to exempt himself  from  having  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the national defence effort as every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nbenefits from the peace and security which National Service  has\r\n\r\nhelped  to  ensure.   Singapore cannot make exceptions  for  any\r\n\r\ngroup  as  that  would undermine the whole system  of  universal\r\n\r\nnational service.  It would also be unfair to those who do their\r\n\r\npart to defend our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service is an issue that is subject to the laws of\r\n\r\nthe  state.  No group, religious or whatever, should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  advocate  the breaking of our national laws.   Allowing  any\r\n\r\ngroup,  for  whatever  reasons, to be excluded  from  compulsory\r\n\r\nmilitary  service  would  compromise  the  universality  of  the\r\n\r\napplication  of  the law.

The uses\r\n\r\nof  information technology have become pervasive in every aspect\r\n\r\nof  a  society - at work, at home and even when we play. Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  reliance on computers in areas such as government, business\r\n\r\nand  public  services has increased significantly  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nover the past few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased use of computers has given Singaporeans a\r\n\r\nwide  range of communication means and access to services.  With\r\n\r\nthe increased use of computers in work and at home, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  tap into a wide network of  electronically\r\n\r\nstored  information  and  services on  the  Internet.  This  has\r\n\r\nincreased their productivity at work and enhanced their personal\r\n\r\nand  social lives.  For example, increasingly, people have  been\r\n\r\nable to handle transactions with government agencies or private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbusinesses   electronically.   This   includes   paying   bills,\r\n\r\nsubmitting applications, booking tickets for sports and cultural\r\n\r\nevents,  communicating  with  friends  and  shopping.   In   the\r\n\r\nbusiness  arena,  transactions are also  increasingly  done  via\r\n\r\nelectronic means, eg, various banks have already commenced  some\r\n\r\nbanking   transactions  through  the  Internet.   The  pace   of\r\n\r\nexpansion of usage of computers is phenomenal over the past  few\r\n\r\nyears and this pace is likely to speed up in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater use of computers at home and at work, not only\r\n\r\nhave  the number of computer related crime cases risen, but  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of sophistication has likewise increased.  Computer crime\r\n\r\ntoday  spans  a  wide  spectrum and computer  criminals  are  of\r\n\r\nvarious  sorts and have different levels of technical  know-how.\r\n\r\nApart from this, another category of computer criminals are  the\r\n\r\nhackers  who  break into computer systems to create mischief  or\r\n\r\nmake  illegal  gain.  CID has investigated cases where  students\r\n\r\nhacked into local and overseas systems in the United States  and\r\n\r\nEurope.   There  was a case involving a hacker who  hacked  into\r\n\r\nlocal and overseas systems to obtain programmes for his Internet\r\n\r\nRelay  Chat  channels and free Internet access  accounts.   This\r\n\r\nhacker did not even pass his \"O\" level, so it does not mean that\r\n\r\nonly  those with higher education are good at computer  hacking.\r\n\r\nBetween  1993 and 1995, there were only three reported cases  of\r\n\r\ncomputer  crime.  All were related to cloning of mobile  phones.\r\n\r\nIn  1996  alone, the number of reported cases increased  to  14.\r\n\r\nMore  significantly, these cases included two cases of  computer\r\n\r\nhacking  and  four cases of unauthorised access.  In  1997,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of cases rose to 39.  In the first five months  of  this\r\n\r\nyear,  25 cases have already been reported.  There may be  other\r\n\r\ncases that were unreported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the number of computer crimes and the\r\n\r\nserious  implications of these offences necessitate a review  of\r\n\r\nthe  Computer Misuse Act.  Computer crime can be as  serious  as\r\n\r\ntraditional crimes.  For example, CID had investigated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  case  in  1997  where a technician at Motorola  accessed  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  human  resource  system,  adjusted  the  data   base,\r\n\r\nresulting  in him getting extra money or salary for a period  of\r\n\r\nabout  two  years.  He also amended the salary data relating  to\r\n\r\nhis  fiancee  resulting  in  her  getting  more  pay  and  other\r\n\r\nremuneration.   In such crimes involving fraud  and  dishonesty,\r\n\r\nthe  culprits were usually employees of the victim companies who\r\n\r\nwere  entrusted with computer access or were able to access  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  systems  due  to poor security  practices  or  through\r\n\r\nillegal means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing use of computers for various purposes in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would mean that this rising trend in computer  crimes\r\n\r\nwould  continue.  It is therefore necessary and timely to update\r\n\r\nthe  Computer  Misuse  Act (CMA) to deal  with  an  increasingly\r\n\r\ncomplex environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, crimes committed through the electronic medium\r\n\r\nand  through use of computers are difficult to detect  but  they\r\n\r\nare  just  as serious as traditional crimes and we must  equally\r\n\r\nprotect  our  population against such crimes.   To  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   remains  an  attractive  place  for  investors   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses to operate effectively and securely, computer  crimes\r\n\r\nmust  be  treated as seriously as other criminal offences.   The\r\n\r\nproposed Bill therefore addresses three areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enhanced security. Firstly, it strengthens the\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework to ensure that the use of  computers  and\r\n\r\nconduct of E-commerce are made more secure.  It will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  law  is  adequate to cover the various types  of  computer-related offences which have emerged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Stronger deterrence. It aims to enhance the deterrent\r\n\r\neffect  of  the  penalties for computer  crimes.   The  proposed\r\n\r\npenalties  will also be proportionate to the damage caused,  and\r\n\r\ndistinguish between first time and repeat offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Up-to-date enforcement powers. It will give Police up-to-date powers of investigation and evidence gathering to deal\r\n\r\nwith complex computer crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Computer Security for `Protected Computers'</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like other countries, Singapore has become more\r\n\r\nreliant  on computers over the years.  This reliance is apparent\r\n\r\nin various essential public and private services.  For instance,\r\n\r\ncomputer systems are used in the provision of essential  day-to-day  services  such as telecommunications, public utilities  and\r\n\r\ntransportation.  The telephone, mobile telephone and the  paging\r\n\r\nnetworks  which we take for granted in our daily  life  rely  on\r\n\r\ncomputer  systems to operate.  Our land and air traffic  control\r\n\r\nsystems and the road traffic light control systems which  ensure\r\n\r\nsmooth  transportation are examples of systems using  computers.\r\n\r\nEven  our  water treatment system to ensure that  our  water  is\r\n\r\npotable  depends  on a computerised process.   In  the  business\r\n\r\nsector,  banking services are also highly computerised -  cheque\r\n\r\nclearance,  money transfers and fund management are areas  which\r\n\r\ndepend  on  computer systems.  Other areas where  computers  are\r\n\r\nwidely  used are in the military and security-related activities\r\n\r\nand  in  the  provision of emergency services (such as  medical,\r\n\r\npolice and civil defence).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity of these systems must be safeguarded to\r\n\r\nensure  that  essential services do not  become  the  target  of\r\n\r\ncomputer  crimes.  Such crimes, if perpetrated,  could  lead  to\r\n\r\nmajor disruption and financial loss to the economy or even  loss\r\n\r\nof  life.  For  example,  if  a perpetrator  overcomes  security\r\n\r\nmeasures,    accesses    and   alters    programmes    in    the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication computer systems causing the telephone network\r\n\r\nto crash, this would create major social and economic disruption\r\n\r\nto  the country.  Another example, if a perpetrator accesses the\r\n\r\nemergency call handling system of the Police or of the Singapore\r\n\r\nCivil  Defence  Force  and  modifies  the  programme  to  create\r\n\r\nproblems  in receiving and dispatching resources, then  it  will\r\n\r\ncause  delay  in response which may result in loss of  lives  or\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry therefore proposes that the Act be amended to\r\n\r\nprotect these computer systems.  Clause 7 introduces a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  section 6C to enhance the penalties for offences  committed\r\n\r\nagainst   \"protected  computers\".   \"Protected  computers\"   are\r\n\r\ndefined  as  those  systems  used in  connection  with  national\r\n\r\nsecurity,  banking  and  finance, emergency  services  (such  as\r\n\r\npolice  and  ambulance services), and essential public  services\r\n\r\n(such  as  public utilities, telecommunications,  communications\r\n\r\nand transport).  The punishment under this section is comparable\r\n\r\nto  provisions under present legislation dealing with  criminals\r\n\r\ncommitting   offences  against  the  State,   serious   mischief\r\n\r\noffences,  and  serious bodily harm cases.  In this  information\r\n\r\nage,  crimes against `protected computers' could have  the  same\r\n\r\ndetrimental  effect  on national  security,  public  safety  and\r\n\r\nintegrity  of the economic system.  The Amendment Bill therefore\r\n\r\nproposes  that  offences  committed on  \"protected  systems\"  or\r\n\r\n\"protected computers\" be liable to enhanced penalties of  up  to\r\n\r\n$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Differentiating Penalties for First and Repeat Offenders/Graduating Penalties according to Severity</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry also proposes to make a differentiation in\r\n\r\nthe  penalties  imposed  on  first  time  offenders  and  repeat\r\n\r\noffenders. Currently, there are three basic offences in the CMA,\r\n\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An offence of unauthorised access under section 3;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) An offence of unauthorised modification to computer\r\n\r\nmaterial,  such as introducing computer virus, under section  5;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) An offence of unauthorised use or interception of\r\n\r\ncomputer services, such as phone cloning offences, under section 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existing punishment for these three offences is a fine of up\r\n\r\nto $2,000 or imprisonment of up to two years or both.  Where the\r\n\r\noffence causes a loss of above $10,000, the punishment is a fine\r\n\r\nof up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the deterrent effect of the law as well as\r\n\r\nensure  that  repeat  offenders are treated more  severely  than\r\n\r\nfirst  offenders,  clauses 3, 5 and 6 of  the  Bill  propose  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  penalties, and to differentiate the penalties  for\r\n\r\nfirst and repeat offenders.  Clauses 3, 5 and 6 also ensure that\r\n\r\nthe penalties are commensurate with the severity of the offence.\r\n\r\nThis  addresses a shortcoming in the current Act, where offences\r\n\r\nunder  section  3,  that  is, unauthorised  access  to  computer\r\n\r\nmaterial,  section  5,  that  is, unauthorised  modification  to\r\n\r\ncomputer  material and section 6, that is, unauthorised  use  or\r\n\r\ninterception  of computer services attract the  same  degree  of\r\n\r\npenalty,  even though the offences under sections 5  and  6  are\r\n\r\nmore severe than those under section 3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offences committed under section 3(1) can be compared to\r\n\r\ncertain  offences in the physical world, eg, that of trespassing\r\n\r\ninto someone's garden or backyard instead of housebreaking. With\r\n\r\ngreater  use  of the Internet in our society, such offences  are\r\n\r\nlikely to increase, based on the experience of the United States\r\n\r\nand other developed countries.  For example, a person surfing on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  may  gain  access into someone's  web  server  or\r\n\r\npersonal  computer out of curiosity. The penalty for  the  first\r\n\r\noffender is revised upwards from a fine of up to $2,000  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  imprisonment or both, to a fine of up to  $5,000  or  two\r\n\r\nyears  imprisonment or both.  The imprisonment term is  kept  at\r\n\r\ntwo  years as this offence is  less severe compared to the other\r\n\r\noffences in the CMA.  As repeat offenders under section 3(1)  of\r\n\r\nthe CMA should be dealt with more severely, they would also face\r\n\r\na  more severe penalty of a fine of up to $10,000 or three years\r\n\r\nimprisonment or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties under section 5(1) (unauthorised\r\n\r\nmodification)   and   section   6(1)   (unauthorised   use    or\r\n\r\ninterception)  will  also be increased to address  increases  in\r\n\r\nsuch offences.  In 1997, there were about 25 such cases.  In the\r\n\r\nfirst  five  months of this year, there were  already  23  cases\r\n\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of offences under section 6(1) are cloning of\r\n\r\nmobile  phones/pagers  or  when a  person  uses  someone  else's\r\n\r\naccount  and  password to obtain free Internet usage.  Recently,\r\n\r\ntwo  persons were charged in court for using illegally  obtained\r\n\r\nInternet accounts not belonging to them to gain access into  the\r\n\r\nInternet.    The  accused  persons  deceived  the  victim   into\r\n\r\nrevealing  to  them  her  password.  The amendment  proposes  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  penalties considering the  consequences  and  the\r\n\r\nlosses  suffered by the victim.   Clauses 5(1) and 6(1)  propose\r\n\r\nto raise the penalties for first time offenders from the current\r\n\r\nfine of up to $2,000 or up to two years imprisonment or both, to\r\n\r\na  fine  of  up to $10,000 or up to three years imprisonment  or\r\n\r\nboth. Repeat offenders would face a fine of up to $20,000 or  up\r\n\r\nto 5 years imprisonment or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 5 and 6 will also increase the penalties for\r\n\r\noffences  under  sections 3(2), 5(2) and 6(2)  where  damage  is\r\n\r\ncaused,  to  a  fine not exceeding $50,000 or  imprisonment  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  7  years or both.  The penalties for these  offences,\r\n\r\nwhere  damage  is caused, can be compared with the more  serious\r\n\r\nproperty  offences in the Penal Code such as criminal breach  of\r\n\r\ntrust where the penalties could extend to 7 years imprisonment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a case to illustrate the damage that could be\r\n\r\ncaused  by  such  an illegal act.  In 1996, in a case  involving\r\n\r\nsection  5(2), a systems administrator who was unhappy with  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  his company, inserted a Trojan  horse  programme\r\n\r\ninto  the  computer  system.  This programme would  replace  the\r\n\r\noriginal system files with damaged files while backing-up of the\r\n\r\nsystem was done.  He also timed the process to occur when he was\r\n\r\naway  on  holiday.   As a result of this, the  company's  system\r\n\r\ncrashed  and  the entire production line came to  a  standstill.\r\n\r\nAfter  his  dismissal,  he  called  a  production  operator  and\r\n\r\ninstructed  her  to  access the system on the  pretext  that  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  erase  his personal files.  The production  operator\r\n\r\nfollowed  his instruction and a set of system files was deleted.\r\n\r\nThe  system  thus  crashed  for  a  second  time.   The  accused\r\n\r\neventually was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharged  for  two  counts  under  section  5(2),  but  was  only\r\n\r\nsentenced  to a maximum fine of $20,000, although the  company's\r\n\r\ncomputer system and production were badly affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of Damage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, there is also a need to recognise that the\r\n\r\nimpact  of computer crime goes beyond just financial terms.   It\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  widen the definition  of  \"damage\"  to  cover\r\n\r\ndamages  beyond financial loss.  Clause 2 of the Bill  therefore\r\n\r\nproposes  to  widen the definition of \"damage\"  to  include  any\r\n\r\nimpairment  to  a computer or the integrity of data  or  program\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) causes loss aggregating at least $10,000 in value.\r\n\r\n(This  is  the  estimated  cost of restoring  or  repairing  the\r\n\r\ndamaged   computer  system.   Economic  loss  such  as  business\r\n\r\nopportunities forgone due to the downtime of the computer  could\r\n\r\nbe  considered if the prosecution could make out a case that the\r\n\r\nloss  was  attributable  to the damage caused  to  the  computer\r\n\r\nsystem);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) modifies or impairs, or potentially modifies or\r\n\r\nimpairs,  the  medical diagnosis or treatment of persons.   (For\r\n\r\nexample,  this  could  involve hacking  into  a  medical  record\r\n\r\ndatabase  to change or falsify the diagnosis on medical records,\r\n\r\nresulting in the wrong treatment being administered);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) causes or threatens physical injury or death. (This\r\n\r\ncould   include   hacking  or  threatening  to   hack   into   a\r\n\r\npharmaceutical plant to change the composition of the  chemicals\r\n\r\nused in the manufacturing of certain drugs); or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) threatens public health or safety. (This could involve\r\n\r\nhacking into the public utilities systems).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Addressing New Offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Accessing computer with or without authorisation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under section 4 of the current CMA, it is\r\n\r\nan  offence for a person to access a computer without  authority\r\n\r\nin  order  to commit a crime.  However, it is uncertain  whether\r\n\r\nauthorised users of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomputer who abuse their authority to access computers to commit\r\n\r\nan offence are currently liable under the CMA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example is the recent case involving Golden Village\r\n\r\nCinemas.   In  December 1996, the management of  Golden  Village\r\n\r\nCinemas reported a case of fraud involving usage of their  Smart\r\n\r\nCards.   Four  accused  persons  were  eventually  arrested   in\r\n\r\nFebruary  1997  in  connection with  the  case.   Investigations\r\n\r\nrevealed that they had exploited the weakness of Golden  Village\r\n\r\nCinema  computer and Smart Card system for monetary gains.   The\r\n\r\nstaff  who had authority to access the cinema cash card  top  up\r\n\r\ncomputer system used it to top up the cash value of unused cards\r\n\r\nfor  subsequent  sale  and  covered  their  tracks  by  altering\r\n\r\ncomputer records.  Although this offence was perpetrated through\r\n\r\nthe  use of a computer, the offenders were prosecuted under  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  for  criminal  breach  of  trust  which  carried  a\r\n\r\npunishment of fine or up to 7 years imprisonment, instead  of  a\r\n\r\nfine  of up to $50,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years if they\r\n\r\nwere to be prosecuted under the amended provisions of the CMA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clarify this uncertainty, clause 4 of the Bill will\r\n\r\namend  section 4 to make it an offence for anyone  to  access  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  to  commit a crime, regardless of whether  access  has\r\n\r\nbeen  authorised.   The  punishment is retained  at  a  fine  of\r\n\r\n$50,000 or imprisonment not more than 10 years or both, as it is\r\n\r\nalready sufficiently severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Acts of Interference or Obstruction of Lawful Use of a Computer</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is currently no law against acts of\r\n\r\ninterference  or  obstruction of lawful use  of  a  computer  or\r\n\r\nimpairment of the usefulness of a computer.  An example of  such\r\n\r\nan  act  is E-mail bombing where enormous amounts of E-mail  are\r\n\r\nsent  to a victim.  When the victim checks his mailbox for mail,\r\n\r\nhe  may  find  hundreds  of  them each  time.   The  process  of\r\n\r\ndownloading the mail would take a long time.  As the  subscriber\r\n\r\nis  entitled  to  a  certain amount of memory  for  E-mail,  the\r\n\r\nvictim's  mailbox may crash.  Currently, Police could  not  take\r\n\r\nfurther action on such cases as there is no law against such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nact.  Victims have to seek help from other organisations such as\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  Service Providers (ISPs) in order to  seek  civil\r\n\r\nrecourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter such acts, clause 7 will introduce a new section\r\n\r\n6A to make it an offence for the unauthorised obstruction of use\r\n\r\nof  a computer.  The proposed penalty is a fine of up to $10,000\r\n\r\nor  imprisonment of up to 3 years or both for a first  offender,\r\n\r\nand a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 5 years  or\r\n\r\nboth  for  repeat  offenders.  If damage  is  caused,  then  the\r\n\r\noffender would face an enhanced penalty of up to $50,000 fine or\r\n\r\n7 years imprisonment or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Unauthorised Disclosure of Passwords or Access Codes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 will also introduce a new section 6B to make it an\r\n\r\noffence for unauthorised disclosure of passwords or other access\r\n\r\ncodes  by any person if he does so for any wrongful gain or  for\r\n\r\nunlawful purpose or to cause wrongful loss.  It is possible  for\r\n\r\na  system administrator to sell passwords to unauthorised  users\r\n\r\nto  enable  free access and usage.  Passwords and  other  access\r\n\r\ncodes  are also used to enhance computer security and such  acts\r\n\r\nwould  compromise  security.  The proposed  penalties  for  such\r\n\r\noffences are similar to the penalties applicable to interference\r\n\r\nor obstruction of lawful use of computer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Necessary Powers for Enforcement Agencies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also amends the CMA to provide the Police with the\r\n\r\nadditional   powers  of  investigations.   In  the   course   of\r\n\r\ninvestigation,  Police may require persons to provide  necessary\r\n\r\nassistance.  For example, the Police may require persons who are\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  or involved in the operation of computers  under\r\n\r\ninvestigation  to  help to retrieve data from  those  computers.\r\n\r\nUnder  the current Act, it is not an offence if a person,  whose\r\n\r\nassistance the Police requires, refuses to do so.  Clause  9  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill proposes to make it an offence if a person refuses  to\r\n\r\nprovide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassistance   or   obstructs  the  Police  in   the   course   of\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  The penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 or up  to\r\n\r\n3  years  imprisonment or both. There are similar sections  like\r\n\r\nthat  in the Penal Code, eg, section 179 - refusing to answer  a\r\n\r\npublic  servant authorised to question -which carries a  penalty\r\n\r\nof  imprisonment which may extend to 6 months or fine which  may\r\n\r\nextend  to  $1000  or both, or section 186 - obstructing  public\r\n\r\nservant  in  discharge of public functions  -  which  carries  a\r\n\r\npenalty  of  imprisonment which may extend to 3 months  or  fine\r\n\r\nwhich may extend to $500 or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing provision in section 14 will also need to\r\n\r\nbe  widened to allow Police to gain access to encrypted data for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  investigation.  Clause  9  of  the  Bill  also\r\n\r\nproposes  to amend section 14 to widen the provisions  to  allow\r\n\r\nlawful  access to data and encrypted material in the  course  of\r\n\r\ninvestigations  of  offences under the Act,  or  other  offences\r\n\r\ndisclosed in the course of such investigations.  As a safeguard,\r\n\r\nsuch powers of access can only be exercised with the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Prosecutor.   Without the  consent  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor,  the  Police will not be able to  obtain  access  to\r\n\r\nencrypted data or material.  In practice, an arrangement will be\r\n\r\nput  in  place for the Police to secure the consent of the  AG's\r\n\r\nChambers without compromising operational efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this Bill is intended to send a strong\r\n\r\nsignal  that  computer  crimes will be treated  and  dealt  with\r\n\r\nseriously in Singapore.  As Singapore positions itself to be  an\r\n\r\nintelligent  island  and  a global centre  for  E-commerce,  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework must keep pace with the  developments  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  integrity of our computer systems against  would-be\r\n\r\ncyber  criminals and hackers.  With the Bill, banks,  commercial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, foreign investors and businesses can rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore would be a good and safe place where  E-commerce\r\n\r\ncan  flourish.  Singaporeans can also rest assured that the  law\r\n\r\nprovides  adequate coverage for the safe operation of  essential\r\n\r\ncomputer systems in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak in general support of this Bill.  I also support\r\n\r\nthe  enhanced penalties for the offences as outlined in the very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  speech  by  the  Minister.   However,  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain proposed amendments that I think merit reconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computer Misuse Act was enacted to criminalise any\r\n\r\nmisuse of computers.  Its original targets were hackers who seek\r\n\r\nunauthorised access to computers and having gained such  access,\r\n\r\neither damage the computer systems or steal data from them.  The\r\n\r\nbehaviour  this  Act  was  intended to control  is  unauthorised\r\n\r\naccess.   Today,  we  are  considering a  curious  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection 4 that would change the general approach for controlling\r\n\r\nunauthorised  access.   We  are actually  going  to  criminalise\r\n\r\nauthorised access to a computer when the authorised user uses it\r\n\r\nto  commit another specific crime.  In other words, the original\r\n\r\nintent  of the Computer Misuse Act to punish unauthorised access\r\n\r\nis going to be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use an illustration to highlight these proposed\r\n\r\nchanges.   If a man either orally or write out a note  extorting\r\n\r\nmoney from his neighbour, he is, of course, liable to be charged\r\n\r\nfor  extortion.  If he uses an old typewriter to  type  out  the\r\n\r\nsame  note, he can still be charged for extortion.  If  he  uses\r\n\r\nhis  computer  at his place of work to print out  such  a  note,\r\n\r\nbeing  a  high-tech  criminal, he can be charged  not  only  for\r\n\r\nextortion  but  he will in addition be liable  to  a  charge  of\r\n\r\ncomputer misuse under the proposed section 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have difficulty understanding why this should be the\r\n\r\ncase.  Under the original provision, the man would be liable for\r\n\r\nan  additional charge under the Computer Misuse Act only  if  he\r\n\r\nuses  the computer without authority.  That is the mischief that\r\n\r\nthe  Computer Misuse Act was directed at.  What is the  mischief\r\n\r\nthat  this  new  section is intended to overcome?   The  man  is\r\n\r\nalready liable to be charged for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  I  should call the principal offence.  Why is it necessary\r\n\r\nto charge him for another computer related offence?  Does it not\r\n\r\namount  to punishing people for using a computer in addition  to\r\n\r\nwhatever  other  crime  he has committed?   If  so,  how  do  we\r\n\r\ndistinguish  such  a  case  from one that  makes  use  of  other\r\n\r\ninstruments such as a pen or an old typewriter in the commission\r\n\r\nof  a  crime?  In the illustration I have given, can one  really\r\n\r\ndistinguish between using a computer from one of using  the  pen\r\n\r\nor  the  typewriter?  The main question is: is it  necessary  or\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  introduce a provision that criminalises  what  is\r\n\r\notherwise  legitimate  behaviour,  ie,  using  a  computer  with\r\n\r\nauthority?   The deletion of the words \"without authority\"  from\r\n\r\nsection  4  is, in my view, unjustified.  I would strongly  urge\r\n\r\nthat these words be retained.  The amendment is unnecessary, and\r\n\r\nnot defensible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that the proponents for this provision may\r\n\r\nargue  that  many crimes, as the Minister has pointed  out,  are\r\n\r\ncommitted  by  employees using their employers'  computers,  ie,\r\n\r\ncomputer  users committing crimes through proper  use  of  their\r\n\r\ncomputers,  and that this is the mischief that the amendment  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that I remain unconvinced about the need to\r\n\r\ncover this situation for two reasons.  First, the employee  will\r\n\r\nalready  be charged with the principal offence, be it  cheating,\r\n\r\nfalsification of accounts, fraud, criminal breach  of  trust  or\r\n\r\nwhat   have  you.   Second,  it  remains  open  for  the  public\r\n\r\nprosecutor  to argue that if an employee uses a computer  for  a\r\n\r\npurpose  that  is  not within the scope of his employment,  that\r\n\r\nshould  be treated as unauthorised access and, therefore, within\r\n\r\nthe  law as it now stands.  This issue remains to be decided  by\r\n\r\ncase  law, and it is much better to allow such a development  to\r\n\r\ntake  place  rather  than  to amend the  law  as  suggested.   I\r\n\r\nstrongly urge Members and the Minister to reconsider whether  it\r\n\r\nis necessary to amend section 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to section 6A. This is a new section referring to\r\n\r\n\"unauthorised obstructioin of use of computer\".  The language of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  section appears to be unduly  open-ended and wide.  I refer\r\n\r\nin  particular to the proposed section 6A(1)(b) where it states,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person who knowingly and without authority or lawful\r\n\r\nexcuse -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     (b)  impedes or prevents access to, or impairs the usefulness or\r\n\r\n       effectiveness of, any program or data stored in a computer,\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nshall be guilty of an offence .'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase \"impairs the usefulness or effectiveness of any\r\n\r\nprogram  or  data\"  is   really very open-ended  and  imprecise,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  relation  to computer  usage.   Again,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to imagine what the mischief the section is  intended\r\n\r\nto   cover.    Impeding   and  impairing   the   usefulness   or\r\n\r\neffectiveness of a program is really a matter of  degree.   Once\r\n\r\nyou turn on a computer and access a program, you are really in a\r\n\r\nway using the program, taking up the memory of the computer and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, maybe impairing the effectiveness of other  programs.\r\n\r\nIs  it intended that this section be applied, for instance, only\r\n\r\nto  aggressive  businessmen who e-mail bomb potential  customers\r\n\r\nwith  their  advertisements?   Or is  there  some  more  serious\r\n\r\nproblem that this section is intended to cover?  It is not  very\r\n\r\nclear in the section itself as to what the problem is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn to new section 6C which contains a new provision\r\n\r\nprescribing   enhanced   punishment   for   offences   involving\r\n\r\nprotected computers.  Such computers are determined according to\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  of  the  person alleged to  have  committed  the\r\n\r\noffence.   Does he know or ought reasonably to have  known  that\r\n\r\nthe  computer is one that is used for certain specific purposes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  security, defence or international  relations  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?    Aside  from  these  purposes,  the  section   also\r\n\r\nincludes  computers  dealing with other  purposes  such  as  the\r\n\r\nprotection   of  informers,  banking  and  financial   services,\r\n\r\ncommunications and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree with the purpose of the section, it is\r\n\r\ndifficult to see why the nature\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  a protected computer should depend on the state of knowledge\r\n\r\nof  the accused.  For example, it is provided in subsection  (3)\r\n\r\nof  section 6C that the requisite knowledge shall be presumed if\r\n\r\nthere  was  an  electronic  warning  drawing  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nsection. Such a presumption would obviously not operate if,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  a  person  does not understand the  language  of  the\r\n\r\nwarning,  or  the  computer is so fast that the  warning  simply\r\n\r\nflashes  through too quickly for the reader to  appreciate.   To\r\n\r\ntake  an  extreme  example.  A foreigner  gaining  access  to  a\r\n\r\nprotected computer, not understanding English or Chinese, may on\r\n\r\nthis  basis have more scope to avoid enhanced penalties  than  a\r\n\r\nlocal  in  the same situation.  One would have thought  that  in\r\n\r\nsuch  cases,  it  would  be better to stipulate  that  once  the\r\n\r\nwarning  is  given, the accused will be liable to  the  enhanced\r\n\r\npunishment.   His understanding or knowledge of the  warning  or\r\n\r\nlack  of  it  may  be  a  factor to be  taken  into  account  in\r\n\r\nsentencing,  and  it should not be, in other words,  an  element\r\n\r\ndeciding whether a computer is protected or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn finally to section 14 - the proposed amendments to\r\n\r\npolice powers.  This includes specifically the requirement  that\r\n\r\nthe  police  are  to be given assistance in the case  where  the\r\n\r\ninformation  is encrypted.  Once again, while I agree  that  the\r\n\r\npolice  should  be  provided with powers to require  information\r\n\r\nfrom  suspects  in their investigation, I do not  think  that  a\r\n\r\nchange to the existing provision is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the original provision does not provide specifically\r\n\r\nfor the situation of encrypted information.  But the language of\r\n\r\nthe  original  section is wide enough to cover such  situations.\r\n\r\nUnder  the existing section, the police can require the  suspect\r\n\r\nto  \"provide  him  with  such reasonable assistance  as  he  may\r\n\r\nrequire.\"   This  is  wide enough for the police  to  require  a\r\n\r\nsuspect  to give assistance with regard to encrypted information\r\n\r\nand  the  like.  There  has not been any  case  concerning  this\r\n\r\nsubject.   It  seems  to  be  too early  to  suggest  that  this\r\n\r\nencrypted  information element is not within the  existing  law.\r\n\r\nMy submission is that the existing provision is more than enough\r\n\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that enough has been said to persuade the\r\n\r\nMinister  and Members of this House that it may be expedient  to\r\n\r\nreconsider whether some of the amendments are actually necessary\r\n\r\nor  desirable.  I hope that there will be a further  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  review the desirability of enacting some of these provisions\r\n\r\ninto law, bearing in mind that the Computer Misuse Act, as it is\r\n\r\nappropriately  named,  is  to  control  computer   misuse,   ie,\r\n\r\nunauthorised access to computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  the rapid development of computer technology  and\r\n\r\nfast  falling prices of hardware and software have  led  to  the\r\n\r\nextensive  use of computers for all purposes.  From the  largest\r\n\r\ncorporations, Government ministries to schools to households, we\r\n\r\ncan  always  see  the  computer at work.  Increasingly,  we  are\r\n\r\nenjoying the convenience and improvement in productivity through\r\n\r\nthe  use of computer networks.  However, the lightning speed  of\r\n\r\nchanges  in  computer  technology and its  indispensability  are\r\n\r\nimposing strains on all social and legal systems.  As Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nhas just pointed out and given examples, laws may not be enacted\r\n\r\nfast enough or realistic enough to regulate without complication\r\n\r\nthe  activities carried out in the virtual world or, in-between,\r\n\r\nfrom the real to the virtual world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent CIA report says that nowadays the scientists'\r\n\r\nability  to network the computers is faster than the ability  to\r\n\r\nprotect them, and given the kind of money they have spent on the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  the  computer systems, they  still  say  that  the\r\n\r\nnational  security of the United States of America can still  be\r\n\r\nat  risk if there is an electronic warfare whereby the attack is\r\n\r\ntargeted to cripple the vast network of computers that  is  used\r\n\r\nto   control   its   power  plants,  transportation,   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, defence systems, etc, as the Minister has  pointed\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, I support this Computer Misuse\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill, which will impose enhanced penalties  on  all\r\n\r\ncategories  of  offences  related to the  misuse  of  computers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the important part is on protected computers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  new  section 6C.  This section carries a maximum penalty  of\r\n\r\n$100,000 or imprisonment of a term not exceeding 20 years or  to\r\n\r\nboth.   While the 20 years' imprisonment term seems like a  just\r\n\r\npunishment,  the $100,000 maximum fine appears low  for  actions\r\n\r\nthat  can cause millions of dollars in damage to the public  and\r\n\r\nis  definitely mild compared to the $50,000 maximum fine  for  a\r\n\r\nrepeat  offence  in  breeding mosquitoes or  $200,000  fine  for\r\n\r\ndamaging an underground cable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has also introduced a new definition on the word\r\n\r\n\"damage\"  in clause 2.  Clause 2 mentions a loss aggregating  at\r\n\r\nleast $10,000 in value, but it does not explain how the loss  is\r\n\r\nassessed.  The reason why I think the calculation of the  damage\r\n\r\nshould   be   spelt  out  in  the  Bill  is  that  the   section\r\n\r\ndifferentiates between offences where the damage is $10,000  and\r\n\r\nabove,  and those which are below $10,000, with the effect  that\r\n\r\nin  the  former  case, the penalties are greatly  enhanced.   An\r\n\r\naccused  will have no way of knowing whether he will  receive  a\r\n\r\nlower  or higher charge because the law does not state  how  the\r\n\r\ndamage is assessed.  Under the same clause 2(b), paragraphs  (c)\r\n\r\nand  (d)  are  probably too wide because it raises the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  a perceived threat to public health or safety or  death\r\n\r\nor physical injury is subjective or objective.  Can the Minister\r\n\r\ndescribe the circumstances under which the controlling authority\r\n\r\nor the court has the subjective power to decide on the damages?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this Bill touches on everybody's life, like the\r\n\r\nElectronic  Transactions  Bill,  there  should  be  more  public\r\n\r\neducation  on the Bill.  I have conducted some personal  surveys\r\n\r\nwith  companies and individuals, professionals such as  lawyers,\r\n\r\nengineers  and  architects, and to my surprise most  people  are\r\n\r\nquite ignorant of the existence of the 1994 Computer Misuse Act.\r\n\r\nNow with these enhanced penalties and, of course, more pervasive\r\n\r\nuse  of  computer  networks these days, it  is  imperative  that\r\n\r\npublic  awareness  must  be  raised  for  the  new  Bill  to  be\r\n\r\neffective.   Many  computer  owners are  not  computer  literate\r\n\r\nenough to protect their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomputers.   I  once heard that somebody hacked into  a  banking\r\n\r\nnetwork system although no harm was caused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual users also do not know that their usual\r\n\r\nbehaviour, such as revealing passwords, loading illegal software\r\n\r\nto play games or to do their own work, to delete the database or\r\n\r\neven  leaving the computer logged on but unattended during lunch\r\n\r\ntime,  can  lead  to  serious consequences.   Like  all  crimes,\r\n\r\nprevention  is  the best way to avoid it.  It is quite  late  to\r\n\r\nalert the public about this law by putting somebody behind  bars\r\n\r\nfor  20 years after a major havoc has been caused by his hacking\r\n\r\ninto protected computers and causing huge damage.  Hence, I urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the public institutions  to  enhance  their\r\n\r\nefforts to protect their computer networks.  At the same time, a\r\n\r\nmajor effort must be put in to find ways to communicate in plain\r\n\r\nlanguage  to the public about the effects of the law, just  like\r\n\r\nthe  one  we  had on speeding 60 km above the speed limit.   The\r\n\r\npotential  penalties  must be firmly registered  in  everybody's\r\n\r\nmind.   Hence,  I suggest that seminars and public  lectures  be\r\n\r\nconducted  at  community centres, educational  institutions  and\r\n\r\ntrade  associations to prepare our people for law and  order  in\r\n\r\nthe real world as well as in the virtual world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than those points which I have sought clarification,\r\n\r\nSir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was\r\n\r\nstudying  in  America, I took the opportunity to  visit  Harvard\r\n\r\nUniversity  where there is a museum of all the first  computers,\r\n\r\nand  I  saw this computer made in 1943, a huge room-size  thing,\r\n\r\nwhich seems to have hundreds of metres of wires in it.  And I am\r\n\r\ntold  that such a computer actually has less power than  one  of\r\n\r\nour  little desktop things we have today.  The use of  computers\r\n\r\nhas  become  so pervasive that everything we have either  has  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  operating it or a micro-chip which is  as  good  as  a\r\n\r\ncomputer,  such  as in our watches, microwave ovens,  cars,  and\r\n\r\nwashing machines.  As a matter of  fact, under the definition of\r\n\r\nthis Act, microwave ovens and washing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmachines being programmable devices are actually also computers.\r\n\r\nSo  if  you misuse them, you also get charged.  But, Sir,  jokes\r\n\r\naside, I think the subject is serious enough when we talk  about\r\n\r\ncomputers per se.  In other words, it is important that when  we\r\n\r\nuse  computers,  being so pervasive these  days,  we  should  be\r\n\r\ncareful  how people use and misuse them.  I think it would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  actually incomprehensible even for the computer makers  in\r\n\r\nthe early 80s, for example, to expect that computers would be so\r\n\r\nwell  used.   In  fact, in 1980, a CEO of one  of  the  computer\r\n\r\nmakers  dismissed  the  idea  that there  would  actually  be  a\r\n\r\ncomputer in every house.  But look at where we are today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important that we catch up with the time\r\n\r\nand  make  misuse of computers something that people  must  take\r\n\r\nnote  of  and  prevent when we can with the law.  I have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  of  the  view that where computers are used to  commit  an\r\n\r\noffence and other offences, for example, extortion, blackmailing\r\n\r\nor  stealing something from employers or the company and so  on,\r\n\r\nthere  is  actually an ultimate offence that can be  chargeable.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter  of illustration, we do not have a  special  knife\r\n\r\nmisuse  law.   Neither  do  we have  a  typewriter  misuse  law.\r\n\r\nBecause  it  is  actually  the result of  that  misuse  that  we\r\n\r\ncriminalise,  whether it be extortion, murder or  causing  hurt.\r\n\r\nThis  is  where  I support Prof. Chin, ie, where we  create  new\r\n\r\ncriminal  offences, we have got to be particularly careful  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  go  overboard.  In the Computer Misuse  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill,  the  new  section  4 talks about authorised  use  of  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  to  commit  an offence.  If there  is  an  offence  of\r\n\r\nstealing  or misappropriation of funds, I think that  itself  is\r\n\r\nchargeable under existing law.  It is good, of course, if we can\r\n\r\nsay  that  if you use a computer because of the way the computer\r\n\r\nworks, how fast it is, and how difficult it is to detect that we\r\n\r\nenhance the penalties, I am supportive of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to take note, as Prof. Chin has urged Members\r\n\r\nand the Minister to do, that if we criminalise something that is\r\n\r\n\"authorised\", then basically we are talking of a situation where\r\n\r\nyou have a transfer of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfunds,  somebody is authorised to use the computer  to  transfer\r\n\r\nfunds,  for  example, he is using an authorised  instrument,  an\r\n\r\nauthorised tool, to do an unauthorised thing.  If it  is  indeed\r\n\r\nthe  concern  of  the  company that there  should  not  be  such\r\n\r\nunauthorised transfers, then I think the moment a person who has\r\n\r\nuse of a computer does an unauthorised thing, then he already is\r\n\r\nusing  a  computer  in  an  unauthorised  manner  and  therefore\r\n\r\nmisusing  it,  and therefore there is no need to  add  the  word\r\n\r\n\"authorised\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the drafters of this new section probably\r\n\r\ntook  a look at cases elsewhere.  There is indeed a case  in  UK\r\n\r\nwhere policemen, for example, use a police computer.  They  were\r\n\r\nauthorised  to do so.  And they use this computer to  do  things\r\n\r\nthat were not authorised.  I think in that sort of situation, we\r\n\r\nreally  are  talking  about a person who,  having  exceeded  his\r\n\r\nauthority, is really an unauthorised user, and so we should  not\r\n\r\nadd this word \"authorised\" which has a very serious implication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on from that point, Sir, looking again at this new\r\n\r\nsection  4, I think what we are trying to catch in the  Computer\r\n\r\nMisuse  Act  is  really not the old class of  criminals  who  do\r\n\r\nthings  like extortion and blackmailing and so on.   But  really\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  new class of misusers of computers who  have  been\r\n\r\ndescribed  in  the literature contemptuously as computer  nerds,\r\n\r\npeople  who are anti-social, people who are social misfits,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  even teenagers out to do mischief.  And we are  saying,\r\n\r\nlook,  computers run everything in our lives, now including  our\r\n\r\nairplanes and control towers and medical facilities.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  want  people  to  be responsible in the  use  of  computers.\r\n\r\nHence, section 3 of the Computer Misuse Act has now been amended\r\n\r\nto  enhance penalties and to add certain new concerns regarding,\r\n\r\nfor example, damage in a way which was never thought of when the\r\n\r\nfirst  Act  was passed.  I support that, Sir.  But I would  urge\r\n\r\nthat  when we talk about this new class of criminals who  really\r\n\r\nsometimes  may win the sympathy of people who say,  \"What?   But\r\n\r\nthese  are  teenagers.  They know nothing  better.\",  we  should\r\n\r\nreally say, yes, they should actually be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nusing  the computer for study, for work, and so on, but  not  to\r\n\r\nuse  to  do  things  that will damage other people's  lives  and\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we talk about an offence which is a true misuse of\r\n\r\na  computer,  I  am  all  for making sure  repeat  offences  are\r\n\r\npenalised  even  more  and  if damage is  caused,  that  greater\r\n\r\nenhanced penalties will be imposed.  And this is now the  scheme\r\n\r\nof  things as we can see.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 6A  all  have\r\n\r\ngot  a  basic penalty for an offence, higher penalty for  repeat\r\n\r\noffence and enhanced penalty for damage caused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new section 6C, which is my next point, we have,\r\n\r\nyou might say, a higher level of enhanced penalties, and this is\r\n\r\nwhen  a  \"protected computer\" is used to do the crimes that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  committed.   So  for  a protected  computer,  such  as  a\r\n\r\nnational  defence computer or a computer which is  used  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for public safety and so on, it is important that  we\r\n\r\nsend  a  clear message that these computers are useful and  they\r\n\r\naffect  a lot of lives and we should not play around with  them.\r\n\r\nThis  is where I support Mr Chuang's view too that we should  go\r\n\r\nout  with  an education campaign to tell people that  these  are\r\n\r\nthings  that you should not be doing.  In a private conversation\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Chuang, he in fact claims that some lawyers do not even\r\n\r\nknow  the existence of this Act.  I leave my mind open to  that.\r\n\r\nBut  I think it is important that not only do we tell people  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of  the  law but also  that  these  cases  have\r\n\r\nhappened.   It is like nobody has heard of this case  until  the\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned earlier in his speech that  there  was  this\r\n\r\ncase.   And  I think it is important for people to be  reminded.\r\n\r\nWhen  these cases are charged in court, the headlines are there.\r\n\r\nBut I think people need to be reminded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go on to say that the new section 6C makes it an\r\n\r\noffence for anybody who commits an offence under sections 3,  5,\r\n\r\n6  or  6A,  if he does it with a protected computer.  But  I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  this new section 6C does not cover section  4  or\r\n\r\nsection  6B.   So what we end up with is an anomaly.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, a person who has access to a computer to commit a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwrong  thing, like transfer of funds or to switch off a computer\r\n\r\nin  a medical facility so that he causes death, this person  can\r\n\r\nbe charged under section 4.  If he does the same thing through a\r\n\r\ncomputer  which  is  a protected system, he  does  not  get  any\r\n\r\nenhanced  penalty.  But if he accesses a computer and  it  is  a\r\n\r\nprotected  computer, he gets an enhanced penalty  under  section\r\n\r\n6C.  I think it is more serious for a person to approach and use\r\n\r\na  protected  computer  to  either do these  offences  or  under\r\n\r\nsection  6B where he discloses the access code.  Sir, again,  it\r\n\r\nis  important that we not only protect computers by making  sure\r\n\r\naccess  codes are not posted on the Net and trafficked and  sold\r\n\r\nfor a price and so on, we should also seriously look at the fact\r\n\r\nthat  if  this  is an access code to a protected  computer,  the\r\n\r\npenalty must be higher.  And if the objection is that this is an\r\n\r\nenhanced penalty on top of an enhanced penalty, I think that  is\r\n\r\nnot a real objection because there are other offences in the Act\r\n\r\nthat already have penalties upon penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point to another interesting issue\r\n\r\nwhich  Mr Chuang has alluded to, and that is, in the new section\r\n\r\n6A  where  any  person  who knowingly and without  authority  or\r\n\r\nlawful  excuse  interferes with a computer.   The  Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned that this covers a situation of what we call spam or e-mail  which  is sent into a computer to just basically  cram  it\r\n\r\nwith full of mail messages and then this causes a breakdown or a\r\n\r\ncrash in the e-mail system.  Here we need to be careful that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  make  illegal and illegitimate a proper marketing  tool\r\n\r\nwhich businesses use, and that is, to use the computer to send e-mail  to  solicit business.  I think there is  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nliterature  on computer spam and even a lot of postings  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet  which  criticise such commercial  parties  from  using\r\n\r\nspam.  But I would say that it is important that we do not close\r\n\r\noff  this  avenue completely if it is reasonably and justifiably\r\n\r\nused.   Therefore, a person's lawful excuse, he might  say,  is,\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  sell  something.\"   I  think the  Minister  should  consider\r\n\r\nwhether this is something that the law would prosecute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier on that here we are trying to make\r\n\r\ncomputer misuse an offence.  And we are tackling a new class  of\r\n\r\ncriminals who really have no concern for other people,  who  are\r\n\r\nanti-social and social misfits, and they have a lingo  of  their\r\n\r\nown, a language that they use.  When you talk about programs and\r\n\r\ndata,  they  know what it is.  And when you talk  about  e-mail,\r\n\r\nthey too know what it is.  In their lingo, data is not equal  to\r\n\r\ne-mail;  e-mail is e-mail, data is data.  Under the  definitions\r\n\r\nof  the  Computer Misuse Act, data actually is  wide  enough  to\r\n\r\ncover   e-mail.   Data  is  defined  under  the  main   Act   as\r\n\r\n\"representations of information or of concepts  that  are  being\r\n\r\nprepared or have been prepared in a form suitable for use  in  a\r\n\r\ncomputer\".  This is wide enough to cover e-mail, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  clarify that, so that it will no  longer  be  an\r\n\r\nexcuse  for a person to say, \"Oh, well, what I did was  e-mail.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  the Computer Misuse Act only protects programs and data  on\r\n\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking on\r\n\r\nthis Bill.  Indeed this Bill is necessary and we are updating it\r\n\r\nto  provide for a changed situation from the time of  the  first\r\n\r\nComputer  Misuse Act some years ago.  If you just  look  at  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Internet users today compared to,  say,  January  or\r\n\r\nFebruary  1995,  just  the  number of  Internet  users,  without\r\n\r\ncounting  the access they can have through their employers,  has\r\n\r\nincreased  10  times,  easily from 25,000 to  about  270,000  by\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year.  And there is an equally  large  number  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  access to Internet using their own  employers'\r\n\r\ncomputers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see that the situation envisaged in 1993-94\r\n\r\nwhen  we first had the CMA was something that we do not  see  it\r\n\r\ntoday.   There  is  an exponential increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\ncomputers,  the usage of computers and the number  of  users  of\r\n\r\ncomputers.   Therefore, we need to update the Act.  By  updating\r\n\r\nthe Act, we are not trying to put obstacles in people's path  in\r\n\r\ntheir use of computers by making\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem  unauthorised users just because they have been  authorised\r\n\r\nto   do  something  but,  if  they  were  to  use  it  for  some\r\n\r\nunauthorised purposes, they will be acting against the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that anybody who uses the computer\r\n\r\nwith  authority  for a lawful purpose will not be  caught  under\r\n\r\nthis Bill.  So have no fear if you are using it for a proper and\r\n\r\nlawful  purpose, with no intent to commit a crime.  You  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to worry that even by removing the word \"unauthorised\", you\r\n\r\nwill  be caught by this new section 4.  I have explained earlier\r\n\r\non  why we have this new section 4.  The idea of section  4,  as\r\n\r\namended,  is  to  remove the uncertainty that a person,  who  is\r\n\r\noriginally  authorised  to access the  computer,  may  now  find\r\n\r\nhimself  guilty of an offence if he were to use it to  commit  a\r\n\r\ncrime.   It will, if he were to use it to commit a crime.   That\r\n\r\nis  what the purpose of this new section 4 is all about.  So  it\r\n\r\nis very clear that we can catch the person under this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues asked why do we not catch them under\r\n\r\nthe  other  laws  because the primary  act  is  that  of  theft,\r\n\r\nextortion, etc, and we could use the other laws to punish  them.\r\n\r\nYes,  of  course, we can also do that.  But we feel  that  if  a\r\n\r\nperson  has actually abused his authority in using the computer,\r\n\r\nwe  should try to use this legislation and update it  so  as  to\r\n\r\nalso  catch him under it.  But it does not mean that the  person\r\n\r\ncan  be  charged twice for the same offence based  on  the  same\r\n\r\nfacts.   So  if  we  were to charge a person for  extortion,  an\r\n\r\nexample used by Prof. Chin, when he uses his computer instead of\r\n\r\nhis typewriter to print the extortion letter, then of course, we\r\n\r\nwill  not  charge him under the Penal Code.  He will be  charged\r\n\r\nunder this particular Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4(2) actually narrows the offences under which we\r\n\r\ncan  charge a person for committing a crime.  It is quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  it is only for certain categories of offences and not  all\r\n\r\ntypes of offences involving the use of computers. In that sense,\r\n\r\nwe  have more or less narrowed the ground for which a person can\r\n\r\nbe charged using a computer with intent to commit an offence, as\r\n\r\nspecified in section 4.  I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngiven the example of the Golden Village Cinemas case.  There are\r\n\r\nother  similar cases which the police in the past have not  been\r\n\r\nable  to charge a person under the CMA because there was no such\r\n\r\nprovision or the provision itself was not clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say this again. If a person uses his computer\r\n\r\nfor a lawful purpose, he does not have to worry that he will  be\r\n\r\ncharged  under  section  4.   If he is  authorised  to  use  the\r\n\r\ncomputer but uses it with intent to commit a crime, as specified\r\n\r\nin section 4, then he may be charged under this Bill.  But if he\r\n\r\nis  charged under this Bill, based on the same facts, he  cannot\r\n\r\nbe charged under another Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin says that section 6A on impairing the usefulness\r\n\r\nor  effectiveness of data stored in a computer seems to be a bit\r\n\r\nopen-ended  and  imprecise.  He asked, apart from  e-mail,  what\r\n\r\nelse  are we actually thinking about and he was not sure whether\r\n\r\nit  is workable.  I gave e-mail bombing as an example of what is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  impeding access or use.  Under section  6A(1)(b),  it\r\n\r\nsays that if a person \"impedes or prevents access to, or impairs\r\n\r\nthe  usefulness or effectiveness of, any program or data  stored\r\n\r\nin  a  computer  .\".   That is how it is  worded  under  section\r\n\r\n6A(1)(b).  An example of this is a person sending commands to  a\r\n\r\ncomputer server which would cause it to perform functions  which\r\n\r\ncould  slow down the programs or cause it to miscompute  certain\r\n\r\nthings  without actually gaining unauthorised access  or  making\r\n\r\nany  unauthorised modifications.  This can be done by exploiting\r\n\r\nthe  bugs  in  the  system or the weaknesses  in  the  software.\r\n\r\nRepeated  requests  may be sent which will  then  overwhelm  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  and  slow  it  down  and impair  the  usefulness,  for\r\n\r\nexample, by making it to miscompute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of such offences are, in the lingo of the people\r\n\r\nwho  know, Ping of Death and Teardrop.  Maybe I should say  what\r\n\r\nare  Ping  of  Death  and Teardrop attacks.  Ping  commands  are\r\n\r\nlegitimate  commands  sent  to check  whether  a  server  is  in\r\n\r\nexistence  or  responsive before engaging it.  If Ping  commands\r\n\r\nare repeatedly sent to the server and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nserver  ends  up  processing  and  responding  to  the  command,\r\n\r\nresulting in it not being able to perform other tasks, then such\r\n\r\nPing  of Death attacks may actually cause the computer to crash.\r\n\r\nTeardrop attacks are packets of useless data repeatedly sent  to\r\n\r\nthe  computer and the computer has to process the data.  It  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, unable to interpret such data and this again may  cause\r\n\r\nthe computer to hang.  So there are many examples of how one can\r\n\r\nobstruct  a  computer, or the use of a computer, or impedes  the\r\n\r\nuse of a computer, apart from just e-mail bombing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we prove that an offence has taken place, ie, the\r\n\r\nsystem has crashed or hanged due to such an offence?  The  owner\r\n\r\nor  the user will have to show that he indeed could not use  his\r\n\r\ncomputer at all.  If the effect of the offence was to impair the\r\n\r\ncomputer's  effectiveness,  for example,  in  slowing  down  the\r\n\r\nresponse  to  legitimate  activities,  then  there  are  network\r\n\r\nmanagement  tools  which  could  show  that,  technically,   the\r\n\r\ncomputer's  response has indeed been slowed down.  So  this  can\r\n\r\nactually be easily checked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also said that the original section 14 in\r\n\r\naddressing  Police  powers is enough.  We do  not  think  it  is\r\n\r\nenough,  in  particular, the Police power  to  access  encrypted\r\n\r\ndata.   If  a person refuses to cooperate or just play dumb  and\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  tell you how to access because he did not  want  to\r\n\r\nreveal  his  password  to  open up  the  computer,  then  Police\r\n\r\ninvestigation  will be impeded.  Section 14  also  makes  it  an\r\n\r\noffence  if a person obstructs the lawful exercise of  power  or\r\n\r\nfails to comply with the request to provide reasonable technical\r\n\r\nand  other assistance to the Police.  The Police may require any\r\n\r\nperson  in  possession of decryption information  to  grant  him\r\n\r\naccess  to such decryption information necessary to decrypt  the\r\n\r\ndata  required  for purposes of investigation.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nPolice just cannot say, \"Open up and show me.\"  It will have  to\r\n\r\nget the Public Prosecutor's consent before it can actually act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang talks about the definition of \"damage\". We think\r\n\r\nthat this definition, as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe have described it now, is a much more sophisticated manner to\r\n\r\ndefine damage so that enhanced penalties for damage can apply to\r\n\r\nserious  situations which, nevertheless, would not  fall  within\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"protected computers\".  As more aspects of our\r\n\r\nlives are being controlled by computers, we will have to find  a\r\n\r\nway of ensuring that we do not suffer as a result of it.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave to provide for protection.  Hackers  can use a computer  to\r\n\r\nhack  into  the  computer  system of  a  chemical  factory,  for\r\n\r\nexample, to discharge toxic chemicals into the environment or to\r\n\r\nchange  hospital  records or diagnosis,  etc,  as  I  have  just\r\n\r\nexplained.  Therefore, we have to define section 2 and widen  it\r\n\r\nto  include, apart from financial loss, impairment to  computers\r\n\r\nthat  will potentially modify or impair the medical examination,\r\n\r\ndiagnosis, treatment or care of one or more persons;  or  causes\r\n\r\nor  threatens  physical  injury  or  death  to  any  person;  or\r\n\r\nthreatens  public health or public safety.  In  that  sense,  we\r\n\r\nhave widened it.  So it does explain how damage is to be defined\r\n\r\nin the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to this so-called anomaly, mentioned by Dr Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat,  in section 6C on the enhanced penalties which  cover\r\n\r\nsome offences but omit others, such as those in sections 3, 5, 6\r\n\r\nand  6A  but  not that of sections 4, 7 and the new section  6B.\r\n\r\nSection 6C aims primarily at offences which affect the integrity\r\n\r\nof  protected  computers and cause adverse consequences  to  its\r\n\r\noperation.   That  is why the principal sections  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nhacking and other offences which could create adverse impact  on\r\n\r\nprotected computers are covered in sections 3, 5, 6 and 6A.  The\r\n\r\ncoverage  does not extend to sections 4, 6B or 7.  If authorised\r\n\r\nusers  of  protected computers commit offences  of  unauthorised\r\n\r\nmodification  under  sections 5, 6 and 6A, then  they  are  also\r\n\r\nliable  under section 6C.  There is therefore no need to capture\r\n\r\nsection  4  under  section 6C.  Section  4  is  to  address  the\r\n\r\noffences  where authorised users use the computers to  commit  a\r\n\r\ncrime  and not to damage the computer per se.  Under section  4,\r\n\r\nif  an  offender has authorised access and accesses a  protected\r\n\r\ncomputer to commit an offence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  sections  5,  6 or 6A, then he would  have  committed  an\r\n\r\noffence  under  section  6C and enhanced  penalties  would  then\r\n\r\napply.  If, however, the person accesses it to commit a criminal\r\n\r\noffence   without  affecting  the  integrity  of  the  protected\r\n\r\ncomputer,  then the punishment under section 4 will  apply.   If\r\n\r\nthe  offender  commits an offence under section  4  and  he  has\r\n\r\nunauthorised  access to a protected computer in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ncommitting  the  offence,  then he would  still  be  liable  for\r\n\r\nenhanced  penalty  because  he has unauthorised  access  to  the\r\n\r\nprotected computer in committing the offence under section 3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for section 6B, if an offender discloses the password or\r\n\r\nthe  recipient  uses  it  to  enter a  protected  computer,  the\r\n\r\nrecipient  can  be charged under section 3 to which  section  6C\r\n\r\napplies  with enhanced penalty.  The password owner can also  be\r\n\r\ncharged with abetting, under section 7, the unauthorised  access\r\n\r\nby  the recipient, and be punished in the same manner, that  is,\r\n\r\nhe  is  subjected  to  the enhanced penalty.   It  is  thus  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to apply section 6C to section 6B per se but  to  the\r\n\r\ncommission of the subsequent offences which affect the protected\r\n\r\ncomputer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for section 7, that is the section relating to abetment\r\n\r\nand  hence  there  is  no  need to  incorporate  it  inside  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section 6C.  However, if a person abets  another\r\n\r\nperson in committing an offence punished under section 6C,  then\r\n\r\nthe abettor would be liable for the same enhanced penalty as the\r\n\r\nprincipal offender.  So the provision of section 6C,  as  it  is\r\n\r\ncurrently drafted, is adequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to Prof. Chin again on the question of\r\n\r\npeople  getting into the protected computers that they  may  not\r\n\r\nknow  that  it  is  a protected computer and  therefore  may  be\r\n\r\npunished.   I  think  all  these cybernauts  are  rather  clever\r\n\r\npeople.   They  know  what they do and  as  they  enter  into  a\r\n\r\nprotected computer, I am told, there will be adequate electronic\r\n\r\nsignposts   and   other   warnings  put  up   stipulating   that\r\n\r\nunauthorised access to the computer or the program or data is an\r\n\r\noffence  and, therefore, it will attract enhanced  penalty.   So\r\n\r\nwarnings  will  be  given to the would-be  culprits  to  try  to\r\n\r\ntrespass protected\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomputer  systems.   The offender would have sufficient  warning\r\n\r\nthat  he is entering into a protected computer as he would  have\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge  that he has read the warning, for  example,  by\r\n\r\nclicking  on  a  link  or a button with a title,  \"I  accept  or\r\n\r\ncomply\"  and  enter before he could proceed.  The  intent  of  a\r\n\r\nperson who accesses a protected computer without authority would\r\n\r\nthen  be taken into account when considering prosecution.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink there will be enough signposts, warnings and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, if you still want to enter, you say, \"Yes, I want to  come\r\n\r\nin and see\", then you are actually committing an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify this\r\n\r\npoint with the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The section actually says that\r\n\r\nwhether a computer is a protected computer or not depends on the\r\n\r\nstate of knowledge of the person accessing the computer.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,  that is not necessary.  You can have a protected computer\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  of  the  warning that  you  have  indicated.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  person understands the warning or  not  should  be\r\n\r\nmaterial only in relation to how culpable he is in accessing the\r\n\r\ncomputer.   But  it  should  not  be  part  and  parcel  of  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of what a protected computer is.  Under the  present\r\n\r\nprovision,  it  is  part and parcel of the definition,  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  is  wrong.    Because that would depend  on  whether  the\r\n\r\nperson understands the warning or not.  That is the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am glad that Prof. Chin accepts the\r\n\r\npoint  that  there is enough warning in the protected  computer.\r\n\r\nThe  question is whether the person needs to know that it  is  a\r\n\r\nprotected computer or not.  I have left it to the AG's  Chambers\r\n\r\nto  advise me on this and, as I said, no law is static.   As  we\r\n\r\ngain  experience,  we  get  more experience,  more  cases,  more\r\n\r\nexamples,  new technology, then all kinds of changes  will  come\r\n\r\nabout.   Eventually, we will find a way to fine-tune and improve\r\n\r\nthe  laws  that  we have.  That is how we conduct  our  business\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Dr Toh's worry about spaming. As he has\r\n\r\ndescribed, spaming is like when people send you junk mail in the\r\n\r\nmail  box but it is done through the computer.  Sometimes it  is\r\n\r\nreally  difficult for us to refuse junk mail other than throwing\r\n\r\nit  into  the rubbish bin.  But in the case of the computer,  if\r\n\r\npeople send you junk mail, then there is very little you can  do\r\n\r\nabout  it.   As Dr Toh said, we really do not want to discourage\r\n\r\npeople  who  want  to  advertise their  products.   But  if  the\r\n\r\ncomputer owner or user feels that he has got so much junk  mail,\r\n\r\nmaybe  he  can get in touch with the Internet Service  Providers\r\n\r\n(ISPs)  or  the service providers to make sure that they  screen\r\n\r\noff  such junk mail from his mail.  The intention is not  really\r\n\r\nto  discourage people who want to advertise, and there are other\r\n\r\navenues of advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I just wanted to make sure that the\r\n\r\nMinister assures advertisers that if they do use this system, it\r\n\r\ncan  be used without being criminalised by the section.  But  as\r\n\r\nto  users  themselves, if they want to stop spaming,  they  can.\r\n\r\nThere  are  software mechanisms.  They can also  tell  the  ISP.\r\n\r\nThat is not my concern, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If spaming leads to obstruction and\r\n\r\nimpedes  the  person's use of a computer, in other  words,  keep\r\n\r\nloading and loading the person with all kinds of junk and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult his computer crashes, then we may have a problem.  But as\r\n\r\nI  said,  the idea here is not to discourage people who want  to\r\n\r\nadvertise their wares or whatever it is they want to sell.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> That is right. In other words, the act of\r\n\r\nsending the e-mail is not wrong but only when the advertiser  is\r\n\r\nso insistent and persistent that he bombs out the e-mail system.\r\n\r\nThen I support that, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> E-mail is data as defined under the\r\n\r\nComputer  Misuse Act.  So do not think that by just  sending  e-mail, therefore, you are not caught by the Act.  You are, if you\r\n\r\nactually use e-mail and bomb other people's computer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back to Mr Chuang's concern about computer\r\n\r\nusers  or  people  who may be caught by the Act without  knowing\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  actually offended the  laws  of  the  CMA  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggesting that we need to have more publicity,  more\r\n\r\ncampaigns, seminars or whatever it is to tell people  about  the\r\n\r\nnew  provisions.  As I said, all these computer buffs are  quite\r\n\r\nwell read people and, of course, we will try to post as much  of\r\n\r\nthis  as  possible on the Internet and other media, so that  the\r\n\r\npeople will get to know of it.  And through the publicity in the\r\n\r\nmedia,  through  cases brought up in court, I think  people  are\r\n\r\nquite  well aware of the offences committed using the  computer.\r\n\r\nWe  do not have to do a big play of it each time we have a case.\r\n\r\nBut I think those who are knowledgeable - I assume those who use\r\n\r\nthe  computer are knowledgeable - will be able to understand the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  their misdeeds.  And  if  that  is  still  not\r\n\r\nenough,  then perhaps more seminars can be conducted  and  maybe\r\n\r\nCASE  can  also  help  in  spreading this  knowledge  among  the\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROL OF VECTORS AND PESTICIDES BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>2.52 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Bill is a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  legislation that will deal with both  insect  and\r\n\r\nnon-insect vectors.  It will replace the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Chapter 79), which was enacted in 1968.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to consolidate and reform the law relating\r\n\r\nto  the  destruction of vectors and the control of  vector-borne\r\n\r\ndiseases, and has new provisions for:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the registration, licensing and certification of\r\n\r\npersons engaged in vector control work; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the control of the sale and use of pesticides\r\n\r\nand vector repellents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this Bill is timely as we are\r\n\r\nseeing  a  resurgence  of vector-borne  diseases,  not  only  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  in the whole of Southeast Asia and  many  other\r\n\r\nparts   of  the  world.   Vector-borne  diseases  are  dangerous\r\n\r\ndiseases that can result in human suffering and even deaths.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  committed to protecting our population  from  such\r\n\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task, however, of preventing outbreaks of vector-borne\r\n\r\ndiseases is a mammoth one.  Its success will depend very much on\r\n\r\neffort  by  the  community  -  from  home  occupants,  work-site\r\n\r\ncontractors, estate managers and just about everyone  who  owns,\r\n\r\nmanages or occupies a property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of dengue fever, for example, my Ministry has\r\n\r\nover  the years been educating the public on ways in which  they\r\n\r\ncan  prevent the Aedes mosquito from breeding in their premises.\r\n\r\nSurveys have shown that the public has understood what needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  done.   Many  do  in fact make the effort to  regularly  and\r\n\r\ncarefully check their homes and compounds.  However, I  have  to\r\n\r\npoint   out  that  even  if  95%  of  the  homeowners   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood have done their part, dengue outbreaks  can  still\r\n\r\noccur if the remaining 5% take an indifferent attitude and allow\r\n\r\nAedes to breed in their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Members will agree that it is really unfair\r\n\r\nto  the majority who are doing the right thing, but still  stand\r\n\r\nthe  risk of being infected with dengue, just because a  few  of\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbours choose not to do anything or remain  careless.\r\n\r\nThe Bill will provide for greater punitive measures against this\r\n\r\nminority group who, by being indifferent, endanger the lives  of\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more and more chemicals and formulations are being\r\n\r\nintroduced  into  the market as pesticides and insecticides  for\r\n\r\nvector control.  Some of these can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npotentially hazardous to the users, as well as to the public, if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  handled  or  applied  carefully.   With  greater\r\n\r\nemphasis given to vector control, there is a need to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  people using and applying these chemicals know what  to  do\r\n\r\nand  how to prevent harm to themselves and to the public.  Also,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  ensure that pesticides, especially those  used  in\r\n\r\nformulated   household  insecticides,  do  not  contain   active\r\n\r\ningredients  that are dangerous to people.  For  these  reasons,\r\n\r\nthe Bill will have provisions to address the professionalism  of\r\n\r\nthe  pest  control  industry and to the sale of  pesticides  and\r\n\r\nrepellents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are today about 110 pest control companies operating\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  They employ about 2,000 employees, half of  whom\r\n\r\nare  supervisors  and the other half unskilled  or  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.   Of the 1,000 or so supervisors, only about  20%  have\r\n\r\nundergone  classroom  training conducted  by  the  Pest  Control\r\n\r\nAssociation and some of the larger pest control companies.   The\r\n\r\nothers learn the trade as they go along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to formalise the training to ensure that all those\r\n\r\nin  the  trade  are  properly trained.  The Bill  therefore  has\r\n\r\nprovisions requiring supervisors and workers to undergo training\r\n\r\ncourses  conducted  by  my Ministry or  by  accredited  training\r\n\r\ncentres.  Thereafter, they will sit for examinations set  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Only when they have been trained and have passed  the\r\n\r\nexaminations   will  they  be  licensed  as   either   qualified\r\n\r\ntechnicians or pest control workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grace period of nine months will be given to those\r\n\r\nalready  in the trade to attend the appropriate training courses\r\n\r\nand  to  sit  for  the examinations.  In the interim,  they  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work  and  will  hold  a  provisional  licence  or\r\n\r\ncertificate as the case may be.  This window period is necessary\r\n\r\nand  fair  as  the industry cannot come to a standstill  in  the\r\n\r\ninterim period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the training and licensing scheme, my Ministry aims\r\n\r\nto raise the level of competence and professionalism of the pest\r\n\r\ncontrol  industry.   Only when the people in  the  industry  are\r\n\r\nknowledgeable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  highly skilled, can we then depend on them to play a bigger\r\n\r\nand more effective role in vector control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight some of the other major\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the public's safety is protected, the Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to  control the types of pesticides that can be  used  in\r\n\r\nvector control and to specify the approved active ingredient and\r\n\r\ntheir  maximum permissible levels.  Only those that are approved\r\n\r\nfor use will be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the Bill will require all pesticides\r\n\r\nused  for  vector  control  and  all  vector  repellents  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered  before they can be sold in the market.  The  product\r\n\r\nhas to be sold in a container or packaged with an approved label\r\n\r\nand carries the registration mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 empowers my Ministry to order the recall of stock\r\n\r\nand   cease  the  sale  of  registered  pesticides,  if   deemed\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 empowers my Ministry to take samples of\r\n\r\npesticides for analyses and the stock can be seized or sealed if\r\n\r\nthe  analyses  show that the provisions of the  Bill  have  been\r\n\r\ncontravened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contravention of any part of the Bill pertaining to the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of pesticides and repellents will incur a maximum  fine\r\n\r\nof  $20,000  and/or  3  months jail for the  first  offence  and\r\n\r\n$50,000  and/or  6  months jail for the  second  and  subsequent\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, we need to come\r\n\r\ndown hard on those who are irresponsible and cause mosquitoes to\r\n\r\nbreed  in  their  premises.  The penalties for the  breeding  of\r\n\r\nvectors will be increased with this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 16, the occupier or owner of a construction\r\n\r\nsite  or  workplace which breeds vectors will  be  liable  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine of $5,000, and/or 3 months' jail sentence for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  offence.   Second  or subsequent offences  will  incur  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine of $10,000 and/or 6 months' jail sentence.  If  he\r\n\r\nignores our advice and continuously fails to eradicate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  breeding places in his premises, he will be served with  an\r\n\r\nOrder  under clause 18.  The Order, other than requiring him  to\r\n\r\neradicate  the  breeding grounds, may require him  to  engage  a\r\n\r\nregistered  vector control operator or licensed  vector  control\r\n\r\ntechnician  to  carry  out  the  vector  control  work  and,  in\r\n\r\nappropriate  cases,  to  stop work for  such  period  until  the\r\n\r\nbreeding habitats are eradicated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 24(a), failure to comply with the Order may\r\n\r\nrender  him liable to a maximum fine of $20,000 and/or 3 months'\r\n\r\njail  for  the first offence and $50,000 fine and/or  6  months'\r\n\r\njail for the second or subsequent offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 49, in cases where the offence is committed by\r\n\r\na body corporate, a partnership or an unincorporated association\r\n\r\nof  person, the director, manager, partner, secretary  or  other\r\n\r\nsimilar officer of such bodies may be charged for the offence if\r\n\r\nit  was  committed with his consent or connivance or if  he  had\r\n\r\nfailed  to  exercise all diligence to prevent the commission  of\r\n\r\nthe offence.  This will enable us to hold management accountable\r\n\r\nfor  the  unsatisfactory conditions of the  premises  under  its\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill does not differentiate between work-sites\r\n\r\nand domestic premises, my ministry intends to offer the occupier\r\n\r\nor owner of domestic premises where breeding of vectors is found\r\n\r\na   composition   fine  instead  of  charging  them   in   court\r\n\r\nstraightaway.  Under the Bill, offences may be compounded  to  a\r\n\r\nsum  not  exceeding  $5,000. The current  composition  fine  for\r\n\r\nhomeowners  is $100.  We will increase this amount  to  $200  to\r\n\r\nincrease its deterrent value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Part V of the Bill deals with the registration,\r\n\r\nlicensing   and   certification  of  pest   control   companies,\r\n\r\ntechnicians and workers respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, with these provisions, the pest\r\n\r\ncontrol  industry will be regulated.  Clauses  25  and  28  will\r\n\r\nrequire  any  company in the business of vector  control  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered  with  my Ministry as a vector control  operator.   A\r\n\r\nregistered vector control operator\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  engage  only  licensed  vector  control  technicians   and\r\n\r\ncertified vector control workers to do vector control work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 26, 27 and 29 of the Bill, no person is\r\n\r\nallowed  to carry out vector control work unless he is  licensed\r\n\r\nas  a vector control technician or certified as a vector control\r\n\r\nworker.   Only certified workers are allowed to assist and  work\r\n\r\nunder  the  supervision of licensed technicians in carrying  out\r\n\r\nvector control work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 provides for the registration, licence or\r\n\r\ncertificate  to  be cancelled, if the person who is  registered,\r\n\r\nlicensed  or certified contravenes the provisions of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nfails  to comply with conditions imposed or directions given  to\r\n\r\nhim,  or  has obtained the registration, licence and certificate\r\n\r\nby fraud or cheating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 35, the maximum penalty for offences under\r\n\r\nthis  Part  will be $20,000 and/or 3 months' jail for the  first\r\n\r\noffence  and  $50,000 and/or 6 months' jail for  the  second  or\r\n\r\nsubsequent offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill deals with the broad principles and requirements\r\n\r\non the control of vectors and pesticides.  Specific and detailed\r\n\r\nregulatory  requirements  will  be  made  under  regulations  as\r\n\r\nprovided for under clause 60 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill enables my Ministry to deal with the\r\n\r\nresurgence of vector-borne diseases more effectively and  better\r\n\r\nprotect our population from outbreaks of these diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has sought the views and inputs of the private\r\n\r\nsector  during  the preparation of the Bill.   They  have  given\r\n\r\ntheir general support to the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Destruction of the Disease-Bearing Insects Act (Chapter\r\n\r\n79) will be repealed when this Bill is enacted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A local newspaper recently reported that, in Hong Kong, a\r\n\r\ndog died and three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmembers  of  a  family  suffered from illnesses  resulting  from\r\n\r\nignorance  in the use of a tick control pesticide.   This  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  example  to  show  how  dangerous  vector  repellents  and\r\n\r\npesticides are.  Most of the chemicals used in vector repellents\r\n\r\nand  pesticides  are  lethal to insects and  smaller  creatures.\r\n\r\nThey   are  equally  lethal,  with  higher  dosage,  to  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  aged  and  young  people.   Therefore,  it   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  people who handle such  chemicals  require\r\n\r\nadequate  knowledge  of the chemicals, the  way  to  handle  the\r\n\r\nchemicals  and  the possible remedial action if  anybody  should\r\n\r\naccidentally come in contact with the chemicals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Bill, which is a comprehensive one, that\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the possession and subsequent application  of  such\r\n\r\nchemicals.  The Bill ensures that all operators, technicians and\r\n\r\nworkers  dealing with the sale and application of the  chemicals\r\n\r\nto   be  registered.   This  will  reduce  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\nmishandling  of the chemicals by lay persons which could  affect\r\n\r\nthe health of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite a personal encounter with a pest\r\n\r\ncontrol  company  which came to my home  for  the  treatment  of\r\n\r\ntermites.   The workers from the company drilled  holes  on  the\r\n\r\nwooden window frame and squeezed a bluish powder into the holes.\r\n\r\nAfter  their work, those holes were left exposed and the  powder\r\n\r\ncould  be easily accessible by ignorant young children.   In  my\r\n\r\nview,  the  bluish powder is toxic and could cause  problems  to\r\n\r\nyoung children when they come into contact with it.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  pest control practice and could only be  due  to  the\r\n\r\nignorance of the workers or irresponsibility of the person doing\r\n\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By registering them, perhaps such errant pest controllers\r\n\r\ncould  be  eradicated from the market and only  those  with  the\r\n\r\nappropriate knowledge will be allowed to operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that the operators, technicians and\r\n\r\nworkers  could  be  given provisional certificates  or  licences\r\n\r\npending the acquisition of certain prescribed qualifications.  I\r\n\r\nthink this provision is too generous and it may lead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  unqualified operators, technicians or workers continuing  to\r\n\r\npractise  without a qualified licence or certificate.   It  will\r\n\r\nundermine  the  spirit of the Bill.  I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nclarify  the  conditions and how long the  provisional  licences\r\n\r\nwould be issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill states that the certificate would last for three\r\n\r\nyears  and  is renewable.  I personally feel that  this  is  too\r\n\r\nlenient in comparison with the Professional Engineers Act, which\r\n\r\ngrants university trained professional engineers with only a one-year  practising licence.  On what ground are the  pest  control\r\n\r\ntechnicians  and  workers, who would any  time  endanger  public\r\n\r\nhealth,  granted a three-year permit? May I request the Minister\r\n\r\nto justify why a pest control licence is not issued on an annual\r\n\r\nbasis, just like the Profession Engineers Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not spell out precisely in what way the\r\n\r\nlicence  could  be revoked.  We must continuously emphasise  and\r\n\r\nremind  all  pest  control licence holders that  their  licences\r\n\r\ncould  be  revoked if they do not comply with the code  of  good\r\n\r\nconduct  pertaining to their practice.  Could the Minister  also\r\n\r\nclarify this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 35, the penalty for the operators, technicians\r\n\r\nand  workers  is grouped into one category if they should  break\r\n\r\nthe law.  The maximum fine is $20,000 and three months' jail for\r\n\r\na first time offender.  In my view, the penalty for the operator\r\n\r\nshould  be  made more severe compared with that of  the  worker.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister enlighten the House on this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 18(4), it is mentioned specifically about the\r\n\r\nlevelling of the ground to prevent vector breeding.  I think  it\r\n\r\nmay  be difficult for the construction site to comply with  this\r\n\r\nparticular  clause  because of the size  of  the  land  and  the\r\n\r\nmovement  of heavy vehicles.  It will be very costly  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith this requirement.  However, effort must be put in to ensure\r\n\r\nthat it is free from vector breeding.  Could the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  elaborate  on how the Ministry intends  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nconstruction  site,  in  particular, compliance  with  this  sub\r\n\r\nclause?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of vector breeding, I personally feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  very important issue for the officer  to  judge\r\n\r\nwhether  the  owner of the premises had violated the regulation.\r\n\r\nTake  a simple example that a house owner checks and clears  all\r\n\r\nthe possible breeding areas on a weekly basis, like clearing the\r\n\r\ntray  under  a flower pot.  I am sure from the day  the  trapped\r\n\r\nwater  is cleared until the following week before the next check\r\n\r\ntakes  place,  rain water could be collected and a few  mosquito\r\n\r\nlarvae  could  be growing.  Before the larva is  turned  into  a\r\n\r\nmosquito,  within a week it will be cleared and there should  be\r\n\r\nno   mosquito  breeding.   Unfortunately,  nearer  the  date  of\r\n\r\nchecking, the Environment officer will come and find a few  tiny\r\n\r\nlarvae in the tray of a flower pot. The owner of the house  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  summoned  for  breeding mosquitoes.   In  my  view,  a\r\n\r\nsituation  like this is arguable, and I hope the Minister  could\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear  whether a situation which I have  described  is\r\n\r\nconsidered to be breeding mosquitoes and therefore in  violation\r\n\r\nof the provision of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 looks like it is unrelated to the Bill. Could the\r\n\r\nMinister explain why one should not remove any vegetation within\r\n\r\nsix metres of any pond or stream?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that chemicals used as vector repellents and\r\n\r\npesticides   could  endanger  lives  if  they  are   stolen   or\r\n\r\naccidentally  discharged  into the  atmosphere  or  watercourse?\r\n\r\nThis  could  happen as a result of a leak caused by  the  impact\r\n\r\nduring  transportation or fire or flood in the premises  storing\r\n\r\nthe chemicals.  May I ask why the transportation and storage  of\r\n\r\nsuch  potentially hazardous chemicals are not part of the  Bill?\r\n\r\nCould the Minister explain?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak  in  support of the Control of Vectors and  Pesticides\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been instances, too often before, of offenders\r\n\r\nof mosquito breeding sites taking fines too lightly and ignoring\r\n\r\nwarnings.  Recalcitrant offenders were flouting the laws in  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance   of  mosquito  breeding  grounds,   especially   on\r\n\r\nconstruction sites.  This had caused a lot of inconvenience  and\r\n\r\nannoyance to the dwellers around the mosquito breeding  grounds.\r\n\r\nBut,  more  importantly,  of course, this  had  facilitated  the\r\n\r\nspread  of  dengue haemorrhagic fever which had caused  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of fatalities.  Hopefully, this Bill will bring down  the\r\n\r\nrising numbers of dengue haemorrhagic fever from a high of 4,300\r\n\r\ncases last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the following changes that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill brings.  Under this Bill, first offenders  face fines\r\n\r\nof  up  to  $5,000  (five times more than  the  current  $1,000)\r\n\r\nalthough  jail sentences remain the same at not exceeding  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  Repeat offenders face fines of up to $10,000 (increased\r\n\r\nfrom  the  current  maximum of $2,000) and  jail  sentences  not\r\n\r\nexceeding six months.  The judge can choose to fine or jail  the\r\n\r\noffender,  or both.  Although offenders who fail to comply  with\r\n\r\nwritten  orders will face unchanged jail terms,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nstiffer fines of $20,000 (up from the current $1,000).  Sir, the\r\n\r\nstiffer penalties in this Bill should put across the seriousness\r\n\r\nthat  must be adopted in this area where negligent behaviour  on\r\n\r\nthe part of offenders can cost lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having more quality control over workers in this field,\r\n\r\nthrough  certification of vector control operators,  technicians\r\n\r\nand  workers,  is also commendable and is a first  step  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction.   This  will involve education,  training  and\r\n\r\nexamination of certain prescribed tests.  There was a survey  in\r\n\r\n1996 which showed that about half of the 2,000 or so workers  in\r\n\r\nvector control would be field operatives, and almost a third  of\r\n\r\nthese field operatives would have had only primary education and\r\n\r\nwould  also be inclined to be older workers.  Many in this group\r\n\r\nhave  been  in  their job for years and could neither  read  nor\r\n\r\nwrite.   These  workers, therefore, may have problems  in  going\r\n\r\nback  to  learn and to pass tests.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat rather than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndenying  this  group of their livelihood, courses  conducted  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  dialects and oral, rather than written, examinations\r\n\r\nshould be arranged for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that public education is the key to achieve\r\n\r\nsuccessful  vector control.  Sir, I know that the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nput  in  a lot of effort in this respect.  However, more can  be\r\n\r\ndone   at   those  locations  where  the  incidence  of   dengue\r\n\r\nhaemorrhagic fever is especially high.  Door-to-door handing out\r\n\r\nof  pamphlets  with  advice  and instructions  will  be  useful.\r\n\r\nInstead of fines alone, households with breeding sites should be\r\n\r\ngiven help to solve their individual specific problems.  A  list\r\n\r\nof  certified  vector  control  operators  registered  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment should be made available and  given\r\n\r\nto  the public when the certification of operators has been  put\r\n\r\nin place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are inadequacies, however, in this\r\n\r\nBill  and I would like to see some addenda made in dealing  with\r\n\r\nseveral  issues.  I would like to suggest that we look at  these\r\n\r\nthree issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, protection of the vector control operators and\r\n\r\ntechnicians.   There  is  no provision  in  this  Bill  for  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  workers from the harmful  effects  of  chemicals\r\n\r\nfound in insecticides.  There are many pesticidal chemicals that\r\n\r\ncause  acute or chronic toxicity in humans.  Some commonly  used\r\n\r\nchemicals  found  in  pesticides are (1)  organophosphates,  (2)\r\n\r\nhalogenated hydrocarbons, and (3) pyrethroids.  All of these can\r\n\r\nbe rather toxic, if misused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organophosphates poisoning can cause convulsions,\r\n\r\nparalysis,  cardio-respiratory depression and  coma.   Death  is\r\n\r\nusually  due  to cardio-respiratory failure.  A fair  number  of\r\n\r\norganophosphate  compounds  are  capable  of  inducing   delayed\r\n\r\nneurotoxicity,  resulting  in  the  clinical  manifestations  of\r\n\r\nsensory disturbance, ataxia, muscle twitching and weakness,  and\r\n\r\nin   severe  cases,  complete  flaccid  paralysis.   Halogenated\r\n\r\nhydrocarbons  can  cause  neurotoxicity with  manifestations  of\r\n\r\nweakness,  paraesthesia and myotonia as well as  suppression  of\r\n\r\nimmuno-responses.  Pyrethroids are the safest of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  three  chemicals mentioned.  Still, they  can  cause  acute\r\n\r\ntoxicity resulting in tremor, profused salivation and clonic  or\r\n\r\ntonic seizures.  There are also reports of organophosphates  and\r\n\r\nhalogenated   hydrocarbons  having   carcinogenic   effects   in\r\n\r\nexperimental animals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the significant toxicity of the pesticides,\r\n\r\nworkers  in  this area should have regular medical examinations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, exposure to organophosphates is under section 69 of the\r\n\r\nFactories  Act (Chapter 104).  Factory workers exposed  to  this\r\n\r\nsubstance  must  have  compulsory and regular  examinations.   I\r\n\r\nstrongly  feel  that  workers in vector  and  pesticide  control\r\n\r\nshould  get  the  same  protection  as  those  workers  in   the\r\n\r\nfactories.   There should not be double standards of  protection\r\n\r\nwhen both workers are exposed to similar toxic substances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, compulsory use of protective gear. There is no\r\n\r\nmention  in  this Bill on the use of protective  gear  by  field\r\n\r\noperatives.  Appropriate clothing, masks, gloves, goggles and so\r\n\r\non  should be advocated.  Preventive measures are very important\r\n\r\nwhen  dealing with toxic chemical insecticides.  Educate workers\r\n\r\non  the  harmful effects of these substances and on  the  proper\r\n\r\nways  of  handling  them.   Make  the  use  of  protective  gear\r\n\r\ncompulsory for these workers.  Abate the possibility of  trading\r\n\r\nthe  safety  of  workers  for  the monetary  savings  that  some\r\n\r\ncompanies or individuals consider as priorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, setting up of a Review Committee. There should be a\r\n\r\npermanent  Review  Committee that can  continuously  assess  the\r\n\r\npermissible amounts of active ingredients used in the pesticides\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The Committee should access continuing  research\r\n\r\nand  current information to determine the safer chemicals in the\r\n\r\nmarkets.   It  must  make  necessary  adjustments  and  aim   to\r\n\r\nsubstitute more harmful substances with lesser ones.  Even  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, it must be alert and ready to abolish  the  use  of\r\n\r\nseriously  toxic  or  proven carcinogenic  substances  from  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   since   independence,  Singapore  has   made   remarkable\r\n\r\nachievements  in housing, environmental development   and  other\r\n\r\nareas.   We  enjoy  the  reputation of being  a  \"Garden  City\".\r\n\r\nEvery year, we have been attracting millions of tourists to this\r\n\r\nGarden   City,  and  this  must  be  attributed  to   the   good\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  planning of the various Government  agencies  and\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation of the people.  It is something that  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  by all of them through their cooperation.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe   must   step  up  our  efforts  to  preserve  our  beautiful\r\n\r\nenvironment, and to maintain our \"Garden City\" reputation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to the report of the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  last  year, more than  17,000  cases  of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding were detected.  In the first four months of this  year,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  dengue haemorrhagic fever cases  has  risen  to\r\n\r\n1,786.  In this beautiful Garden City of Singapore where a  high\r\n\r\nstandard of hygiene is maintained,  so many of these cases  were\r\n\r\ndetected.   I  think this is certainly something  that  warrants\r\n\r\nour attention and concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to further control vector breeding, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof the Environment is moving this Amendment Bill to deal sternly\r\n\r\nwith people responsible for vector breeding in order to preserve\r\n\r\nour  hygienic environment.  Under the new Bill, anyone found  to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible  for breeding mosquitoes in construction  sites,\r\n\r\npremises,  ships  and even in the cabins of  aeroplanes  may  be\r\n\r\nfaced with a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment  not exceeding\r\n\r\nthree months, or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to preserve and protect the health of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the reputation that we have in the world as  a\r\n\r\nGarden  City, I support this Amendment Bill.  But to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the new Act can be more effectively implemented,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to make three suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the work of vector control should be done\r\n\r\ncomprehensively.  In other words, the possible places and  sites\r\n\r\nof  vector breeding should be embodied in the ambit of the  Act,\r\n\r\nso that the various Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies will be better able to control the breeding places.   I\r\n\r\nfind  that  in the new Amendment Bill, the parks and undeveloped\r\n\r\nvacant  land  have not been included.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  public\r\n\r\nparks are places that the public and tourists frequent.  In most\r\n\r\nof  our parks and gardens we also have ponds.  Wherever there is\r\n\r\nwater,   there  is  an  opportunity  for  mosquitoes  to  breed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  should further control  these possible  breeding\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, vacant lands reserved for future development,\r\n\r\nespecially  vacant lands near the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nestates, should be further controlled and managed.  There should\r\n\r\nbe  regular  spraying  of insecticides to  prevent  breeding  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.   When  I  went  on  house-to-house  visits  of   my\r\n\r\nconstituents,  many residents told me that a lot  of  mosquitoes\r\n\r\ndid  not  come  from the HDB flats themselves, but had  actually\r\n\r\ncome   from  undeveloped  lands,   woods  or  forests    nearby.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in order to have a better control of these potential\r\n\r\nbreeding  places,  I think we should  consider  including  these\r\n\r\nundeveloped vacant lands and public parks in the ambit  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must have a national campaign against mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nEvery  citizen has a responsibility to do this, and it  is  good\r\n\r\nfor  everybody.   In  order to better  educate  our  public  and\r\n\r\npromote their awareness on the possibility of mosquito breeding,\r\n\r\nI  would  suggest  that the Ministry of the Environment  get  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  the CDCs and the Town Councils, schools, residents,\r\n\r\nespecially  the private residents, to start a national  campaign\r\n\r\nagainst  mosquitoes, so that we can eradicate all  the  possible\r\n\r\nand  potential  mosquito breeding places  and  sites.   I  think\r\n\r\npublic education is more effective than fines alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must conduct training classes which are open to\r\n\r\nthe  public.   I  am  glad  to know that  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  has  started training courses for  technicians  and\r\n\r\nworkers in vector control.  But because there are more and  more\r\n\r\ncases  being brought to our notice, I hope that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe Environment can conduct  more courses to train\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and  the technicians so that  they  may  have  the\r\n\r\nprofessional qualifications and skills to handle vector  control\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have been hit by some kind of economic\r\n\r\nrecession and many workers have been retrenched.  We can  create\r\n\r\nmore  job  opportunities if the Ministry of the Environment  can\r\n\r\nconsider  providing training courses for the retrenched workers,\r\n\r\nso  that  in this critical time they can have job opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  like killing two birds with one stone.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  objectives of vector control, I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider my three suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me thank the three Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken  in support of this Bill.  Dr  Low  Seow  Chay\r\n\r\nraised  quite a few points.  His first one was in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisional certificate.  He felt that the nine months  for  the\r\n\r\nprovisional certificate, as provided under the Bill,  is  a  bit\r\n\r\ntoo  generous.  Sir, we need to provide adequate  time  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  group  of  workers  to undergo  training  and  to  pass\r\n\r\nexaminations.   The  nine  months,  I  think,  are  just   about\r\n\r\nadequate.   In  fact, in talking to the industry,  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies have requested for a longer provisional licence period\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  pointed out by some of the speakers, some  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  crop  of  workers are not that well educated.   So  the\r\n\r\nemployers were afraid that even with the nine months,  they  may\r\n\r\nnot find that the time given to them long enough for them to  be\r\n\r\ntrained properly.  So the period of nine months, I think,  is  a\r\n\r\ngood compromise.  The industry's work can continue.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  we are giving the current group of workers adequate  time\r\n\r\nto undergo training and to pass examinations.  Especially as the\r\n\r\nlast speaker has mentioned, with the poor economic situation, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to put any of these workers unnecessarily  out  of\r\n\r\nwork either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned that the issuing of a certificate for\r\n\r\nthree  years  is a bit too lenient, that even for the  engineers\r\n\r\nthey  are only issued a one-year licence.  I think the effective\r\n\r\nperiod  of  the  licence depends very much on the  organisation.\r\n\r\nMany organisations, in fact, are now proceeding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  give  licences  of  a longer duration.   In  fact,  for  the\r\n\r\nengineers,  unless I am wrong, I  think the one-year licence  is\r\n\r\nrenewed without any re-testing.  So it is just an administrative\r\n\r\nprocess  of getting them to renew.  Similarly, for the  workers.\r\n\r\nOnce they are trained properly and have passed the examinations,\r\n\r\nwe  will  give them a three-year certificate to enable  them  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their  work.   But  at  the  same  time,  there  are\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Bill for my Ministry to cancel their  licence\r\n\r\nor  certificate  if  they  are found  to  have  contravened  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill.  So the safeguards are there.  If any of\r\n\r\nthese workers, although they are trained and they know what they\r\n\r\nare  supposed  to do, do not comply with the requirements,  they\r\n\r\nwill then lose their licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why all the three groups, ie, the\r\n\r\noperators,  the  technicians and the  workers,  are  categorised\r\n\r\nunder  the  same  provision,  in terms  of  penalty.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\npenalties,  as provided under this Bill, represent  the  maximum\r\n\r\npenalty.   As  to how much of the penalty they will  receive  it\r\n\r\nwill  actually  depend on the offences they have committed,  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  surrounding the offence and the severity  of  the\r\n\r\noffence.   It  will be very much left to the magistrate  hearing\r\n\r\nthe  case to decide how big a penalty to impose on them.  So  if\r\n\r\nthe operator is found to be the one who is responsible, then  of\r\n\r\ncourse the operator will receive a larger penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the requirements this Bill will\r\n\r\npose  to the construction companies, in terms of compliance with\r\n\r\nkeeping their sites free of potholes, for example, and all areas\r\n\r\nwhich  can allow vectors to breed.  Sir, the Bill is quite clear\r\n\r\nin  this regard.  The owner or operator of a site is required to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  conditions that can lead to the  breeding  of\r\n\r\nvectors  are  totally eradicated.  For a construction  site,  it\r\n\r\nmeans that if there are potholes or ponding in certain parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  site, they have to ensure that that area is levelled up and\r\n\r\nthe  potential  for  vector breeding is eradicated  because  our\r\n\r\nprimary concern must be for the health and safety of the people.\r\n\r\nFilling up the potholes does not cost very much.  But if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  pothole  is not filled up and larvae start to breed  there,\r\n\r\npeople living near the construction site  will then go down with\r\n\r\ndengue  and,  worse,  some may go down with dengue  haemorrhagic\r\n\r\nfever which can, as Members know, lead to death.  So our concern\r\n\r\nmust  be  for the safety of our people and the cost involved  in\r\n\r\nkeeping the site clear of vector breeding potential, I think, is\r\n\r\nvery small in respect of the cost to the population otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked if a house owner is liable if he has potted\r\n\r\nplants  around  and he puts a tray under each potted  plant  and\r\n\r\nwater  collects there and larvae are found on the  trays.   Sir,\r\n\r\nagain,  the  Bill  is quite unambiguous.  Every  home  owner  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  ensuring that the conditions for  breeding  of\r\n\r\nvectors  are  totally  eradicated.  That is  why  we  have  been\r\n\r\nadvising all home owners that if they have potted plants, please\r\n\r\nremove the trays.  If they feel the need to have the tray there,\r\n\r\nthen  instead  of checking it every week, they should  check  it\r\n\r\nevery two days. Otherwise the responsibility is still theirs  if\r\n\r\nmosquitoes are found to be breeding in that little pool of water\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about clause 20 and he says that it seems to\r\n\r\nbe  out of place.  Sir, clause 20 is a very specific requirement\r\n\r\nand  it is meant to address the problem of breeding of Anopheles\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  The Anopheles mosquito is a vector for malaria  and\r\n\r\nthis  species  of mosquito breeds in streams and  seepage  water\r\n\r\nand, more importantly, it requires sunlight.  Therefore, we have\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that where there are streams, running  water  and\r\n\r\nseepage  water,  the undergrowth is not unintentionally  cleared\r\n\r\naway because that will then give greater access to sunlight  and\r\n\r\nincrease the potential for Anopheles mosquitoes to breed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked why the transport and storage of hazardous\r\n\r\nchemicals are not part of the Bill.  Sir, I agree with him  that\r\n\r\nit  is  important to regulate the transportation and storage  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  chemicals.   It is under  a  different  Act.   It  is\r\n\r\ncatered for under the Poisons Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also raised a few suggestions. Her first\r\n\r\nsuggestion is that since the workers in this industry tend to be\r\n\r\nnot very well educated, perhaps, the training courses should  be\r\n\r\nin  dialects and, as far as possible, the examination should not\r\n\r\nbe  in  written  form.   Sir, in fact we do  intend  to  conduct\r\n\r\ntraining  courses,  not just in dialects,  but  also  in  Malay.\r\n\r\nAlso,  most  of the questions would be in the form  of  multiple\r\n\r\nchoice  answers  to make it simpler for the workers  and,  where\r\n\r\nappropriate, pictures will be used instead.  So this  will  make\r\n\r\nit  much easier for us to test the understanding of the workers.\r\n\r\nOur key priority is to make sure that the workers understand the\r\n\r\ndanger of what they are handling, how to protect themselves and,\r\n\r\nmore  importantly,  how to protect the general  public  who  are\r\n\r\nliving in the midst of where they are spraying, for example.  So\r\n\r\nthe examination will be conducted in such a way that we can test\r\n\r\ntheir knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, she asked that, in our effort to eradicate dengue\r\n\r\nfever  and the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, we should go  on  a\r\n\r\ndoor-to-door campaign and that we should help the households  to\r\n\r\nsolve their specific problems.  Sir, I do not think it is really\r\n\r\npossible  for us to do a door-to-door campaign, if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nreach  out  to the whole country.  What we have is a very  broad\r\n\r\nbased  education approach where, throughout the year,  pamphlets\r\n\r\nand brochures are being sent out to households, especially those\r\n\r\nin  areas  which are prone to the breeding of Aedes  mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThen  we provide them with literature and the key advice on what\r\n\r\nto  do.   For  those households which are found to  be  breeding\r\n\r\nmosquitoes, we actually counsel and advise them on the  specific\r\n\r\nsteps to take.  For example, where the gutters are choked up, we\r\n\r\nwill  explain  to them the need to check the gutters  regularly,\r\n\r\nclear  the gutters and even drill holes in the gutters to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  ponding of water in certain  parts  of  the\r\n\r\ngutters which tend to sag over time.  What we have found is that\r\n\r\nmost  households  actually do know what they  should  be  doing.\r\n\r\nWhen they are caught, they will say, \"Yes, I wanted to do it but\r\n\r\nI forgot.\"  So the key thing is to educate them and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntell  them that everyone needs to play a very responsible  role.\r\n\r\nThey  should put their knowledge into action and not assume that\r\n\r\neverything will be well.  Because at the end of the day, if  the\r\n\r\nAedes mosquitoes are breeding, their own family members would be\r\n\r\nthe first to be bitten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she also pointed out that the chemicals present in the\r\n\r\npesticides  and insecticides are dangerous.  We are  introducing\r\n\r\nthis Bill because the chemicals are becoming more potent.  There\r\n\r\nis  a  much  bigger range of chemicals now being  available  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  must ensure that the industry and those  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the industry, from the operators to the technicians\r\n\r\nto  the workers, are knowledgeable and trained.  So we are going\r\n\r\nto  train  them and part of the training will also be  to  train\r\n\r\nthem  in handling the chemicals, to protect themselves and  also\r\n\r\nthe  general public.  We will also require the workers  and  the\r\n\r\ntechnicians through the issue of a code of good practice to  use\r\n\r\nproper  equipment and protective gear.  In this way,  this  will\r\n\r\nprotect  the  workers as well as the general public through  the\r\n\r\nuse  of proper equipment.  All the workers and technicians  will\r\n\r\nbe required to go for annual medical checkups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also proposed that a committee be set up to assess the\r\n\r\nsafety of the products.  Sir, Dr Neo will be happy to know  that\r\n\r\nwe  already have such a committee in operation.  It is known  as\r\n\r\nthe Advisory Committee for Hazardous Substances and Toxic Wastes\r\n\r\nand this Committee is charged with reviewing the import, storage\r\n\r\nand  use  of poison and other hazardous chemicals.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nalready ongoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has asked that public parks and vacant\r\n\r\nland should also be included in the Bill.  Sir, public parks and\r\n\r\nvacant  lands are also covered because this Bill also binds  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  ie, all Government departments have to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Bill.  If there are vacant State  lands,\r\n\r\nfor example, the body that is responsible for looking after that\r\n\r\nState land is also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  ensuring that the  land  is  clear  of  vector\r\n\r\nbreeding  sites  and, if not, we will also take  action  against\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also stressed the importance of education. He said that\r\n\r\nfines  are good but it is also important to educate the  people.\r\n\r\nWe do have a very active education programme going on.  It is  a\r\n\r\nyear round programme.  We have exhibitions at community centres,\r\n\r\nshopping  centres and the various grassroots organisations.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue to do that.  In fact, with the setting up of  the\r\n\r\nCDCs,  we are now in active communication with some of the  CDCs\r\n\r\nto  see  what  we  can  do,  in terms of   working  together  to\r\n\r\npropagate the message in the constituencies under them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that, to make the training programme\r\n\r\nmore  accessible, we should arrange for more centres to  be  set\r\n\r\nup.   Sir,  our intention is to have the private sector  conduct\r\n\r\nthe  training  eventually.   As a start,  we  will  set  up  the\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes and the examinations, and we will encourage\r\n\r\nprivate  companies to come forward and offer training programmes\r\n\r\nwhich   we  will  then  vet  and  endorse.   Our  responsibility\r\n\r\neventually  will  only be to set the examinations,  certify  and\r\n\r\nissue  certificates to the workers who qualify.  That is  indeed\r\n\r\nour approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to clarify one point.

The  Act  establishes the Majlis Ugama  Islam  Singapura\r\n\r\n(MUIS)  to  administer Muslim affairs and the Syariah  Court  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  matters  such as divorce, custody,  maintenance  and\r\n\r\ndivision  of matrimonial property.  Both the Syariah  Court  and\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Courts  have co-existed for many years.   They  have\r\n\r\ncomplemented each\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  in  ensuring that justice is administered to Muslims  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  recourse  to the law  to  resolve  their  family\r\n\r\nmatters.  Muslim women have, for many years, looked to the Civil\r\n\r\nCourts  to  claim  maintenance from their  husbands.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  Muslims have also turned to the Civil Courts to  resolve\r\n\r\ncustody disputes under our Guardianship of Infants Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one important area where Muslim women, especially,\r\n\r\nhave  turned  to  the Civil Courts.  After a divorce  has  taken\r\n\r\nplace,  the Syariah Court may order that one party transfer  the\r\n\r\nownership of the home to the other.  Where that party refuses to\r\n\r\ndo so, the other party has often turned to the High Court for  a\r\n\r\nDeclaration  that  the  matrimonial  home  be  transferred,   as\r\n\r\ndirected  by  the  Syariah  Court.   Once  this  Declaration  is\r\n\r\nobtained,  the  transfer papers can be executed by  the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt's  Registrar even if the party who is ordered to  transfer\r\n\r\nthe home refuses to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has existed for many years. Both the Civil\r\n\r\nCourts  and  Syariah  Court have worked  together  in  order  to\r\n\r\nresolve  family  disputes involving Muslims.  Muslims  benefited\r\n\r\ngreatly  from this as there was a range of options open to  them\r\n\r\nto  pursue  their quest for justice.  They have  had  a  choice.\r\n\r\nThroughout  the entire period the Civil Courts were careful  not\r\n\r\nto  interfere  in  the religious aspects of the  Syariah  Court.\r\n\r\nThus  the  Civil  Courts never interfered with matters  such  as\r\n\r\ndivorce,  betrothal,  nullity or the determining  of  iddah  and\r\n\r\nmutaah.  These remained exclusively within the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation changed in 1995 when, in the case of Salijah\r\n\r\nv  Abdullah  Teo, the Court of Appeal ruled that Muslims  cannot\r\n\r\nseek  a Declaration from the High Court.  Even though the  Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal  ultimately granted a Mandatory  Injunction  to  give\r\n\r\neffect to the Syariah Court's order, there was concern that this\r\n\r\nmeant  that in future, Muslims could no longer turn to the Civil\r\n\r\nCourts as they did before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concern was exacerbated when in November 1996, in\r\n\r\nLathibaby's  case,  the  High  Court  ruled  that  it   had   no\r\n\r\njurisdiction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  hear custody and maintenance cases involving Muslim children\r\n\r\nwhere the parents had either:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) applied to the Syariah Court for divorce; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) had been divorced in that Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cases have unsettled what has been an established\r\n\r\nsystem for the Muslim community in Singapore.  Suddenly, Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore no longer enjoyed the avenues and choices they had\r\n\r\nfor  many  years  for  the resolution of  disputes  over  family\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real and urgent issue therefore had arisen which would\r\n\r\naffect  pending and future cases.  Sir, let me give  Members  an\r\n\r\nidea  of  the size of the problem.  In 1996, for example,  2,445\r\n\r\nMalay couples filed maintenance applications in the Family Court\r\n\r\nalone.  In 1997, there were 2,401 applications, and in the first\r\n\r\nhalf  of this year, 1,407 applications.  The Syariah Court  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to cope with all these cases if it were to  handle\r\n\r\nthem alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had consulted the Ministry of Law, AG's Chambers,\r\n\r\nMUIS, the Syariah Court and Malay MPs.  They agreed with me that\r\n\r\nunless we reinstate and formalise the situation that had existed\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Lathibaby's  case, we would  face,  as  one  of  my\r\n\r\nofficials  put  it,  \"daily queues forming outside  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  that  stretch  right down to Toa  Payoh!\"   We  therefore\r\n\r\nchose to restore the status quo ante.  But more than this,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think  we  cannot, as a principle, deny Muslim couples  their\r\n\r\nrightful access to the Civil Courts if they so choose this forum\r\n\r\nto solve their disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment has been labelled by some people as\r\n\r\n\"reactive\"   rather  than  taking  a  long-term  view   of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  Syariah Court and the aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community.  Sir, I do not apologise for  this  approach.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  man is drowning, taking the long-term view of  teaching\r\n\r\nhim   to  swim  does  nothing  to  save  him  from  his  present\r\n\r\npredicament!  There is a problem that needed resolution and  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility   must  be  to  find  a  quick,   effective   and\r\n\r\npracticable solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that this Bill seeks to enable established\r\n\r\npractices  which have worked satisfactorily to  continue.   What\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  proposes is that, as a base, the Syariah Court  would\r\n\r\nhave   jurisdiction  over  all  matters  presently  within   its\r\n\r\njurisdiction  where  the  parties are Muslims  or  were  married\r\n\r\naccording to Muslim law.  However, parties can agree  to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Courts  for  disputes over maintenance,  custody  of\r\n\r\nchildren  and division of matrimonial property.  Where there  is\r\n\r\nno  agreement, a Muslim party can only go to the Civil Courts if\r\n\r\nhe  first obtains leave from the Syariah Court.  A grant of such\r\n\r\nleave  by the Syariah Court can be challenged.  Ultimately,  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court's Appeal Board will decide on the issue.  To avoid\r\n\r\nduplicity of proceedings, the Bill provides that where one court\r\n\r\nhas  jurisdiction over a matter, the other court will  cease  to\r\n\r\nhave any jurisdiction over that matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give effect to all these, this Bill amends the relevant\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  both  AMLA  as well  as  the  Supreme  Court  of\r\n\r\nJudicature Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have asked why cannot we just streamline and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  jurisdiction of the Syariah Court,  instead  of\r\n\r\nreverting to the concurrent system.  Yes, we should do that  and\r\n\r\nindeed  that  is  a matter which myself and my  colleagues  will\r\n\r\npursue.  But that will take time.  Meanwhile, we should not  let\r\n\r\nmatters  be  in  a limbo because it is not good for  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress at this stage that neither the Civil Courts\r\n\r\nnor  the  Government is forcing concurrent jurisdiction  on  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Government has always held the view that the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity itself will have to decide what it wants and where  it\r\n\r\nwants to go provided it is in the context of the type of society\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  and the role that the community  wishes  to  play\r\n\r\nwithin this society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now refer to other parts of the Bill. Foremost\r\n\r\namong  these  other  matters are the  conferment  of  additional\r\n\r\npowers on the Syariah Court.  These will make the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\na much more efficient and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neffective  body for the administration of justice to Muslims  in\r\n\r\nfamily matters.  These additional provisions are as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Giving effect to Syariah Court Orders -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes that Syariah Court Orders can be\r\n\r\nregistered  with the District Court for purposes of enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe  formidable enforcement machinery of the Civil  Courts  will\r\n\r\nnow be used to enforce judgements made by the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Syariah Court can also now amend, vary or rescind its\r\n\r\norders.   Previously it had no such power and any  amendment  or\r\n\r\nrecission  of  an  order made must be by way of  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nAppeal Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court can also now order costs to be paid by any party.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  it can execute documents, such  as  transfers  of\r\n\r\nproperty, on behalf of a defaulting party who has refused to  do\r\n\r\nso.  This resolves the problem highlighted in the Salijah case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Improvements to Syariah Court Operations -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to improve the efficiency of the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  by  enabling additional Presidents to be  appointed.   It\r\n\r\nalso includes a new provision prescribing that decisions of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court and the Appeal Board are final and that there  can\r\n\r\nbe  no  further appeal or review of these decision by the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Transitional Provision -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a transitional provision. We also have introduced\r\n\r\na saving provision enabling cases which are pending in the Civil\r\n\r\nCourts  to proceed in these courts without the need for  consent\r\n\r\nof the other party or leave from the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to MUIS. Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers of\r\n\r\nMUIS  also  need  to be enhanced to give it more  focus  and  to\r\n\r\nenable  it  to operate its religious functions more effectively.\r\n\r\nSince  1975, the Saudi authorities have preferred to  deal  only\r\n\r\nwith  MUIS on Haj (pilgrimage) matters.  This is largely due  to\r\n\r\nthe powers and good standing of MUIS as the supreme Islamic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nauthority  in  Singapore, and the amendment seeks  to  recognise\r\n\r\nthis  key  function.  MUIS will be empowered to be the authority\r\n\r\nto  regulate  pilgrimage  services. But  it  will  not  directly\r\n\r\noperate or be involved in operating pilgrimage services itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS has also been advising on halal matters as it is an\r\n\r\nissue  of  concern to the Muslim public.  The proposed amendment\r\n\r\nwill give MUIS the sole authority to advise on halal matters, to\r\n\r\nregulate  halal  certification, and to issue halal  certificates\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosecution of offenders under the Sale of Food Act and the\r\n\r\nPenal Code remains unchanged, as of now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will strengthen MUIS' position as the\r\n\r\nauthority on Muslim affairs in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unwise for MUIS as a religious body to be directly\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  commercial activities, and as a  statutory  board,\r\n\r\nMUIS  is  currently constrained from adopting market  practices.\r\n\r\nAMLA  is  therefore to be amended to allow it, with my approval,\r\n\r\nto  form  companies and joint ventures. Those current operations\r\n\r\nof  MUIS  that are more commercial in nature, such  as  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment, property maintenance and wakaf  administration, can\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out by subsidiary companies which can  manage  such\r\n\r\noperations more effectively.  The separate accounting  by  these\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  companies will also enable MUIS  to  streamline  its\r\n\r\noperations, make it more focused and prevent cross-subsidies  of\r\n\r\ninefficient projects by more economically viable ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounts of MUIS will also be streamlined. The\r\n\r\naccounts  of any trust, wakaf, nazar and mosque vested  in  MUIS\r\n\r\nare  separate  accounting entities from  MUIS'  accounts,  which\r\n\r\ncomprise  the  General Endowment Fund, the Mosque Building  Fund\r\n\r\nand  MENDAKI Fund and such other accounts which the Minister may\r\n\r\nspecify  in  the  Gazette.  It is not  necessary  to  have  them\r\n\r\nconsolidated  with MUIS' accounts.  The amendments will  clearly\r\n\r\nseparate these accounting entities from MUIS' accounts and  will\r\n\r\nmake them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubjected to a separate audit.  MUIS will now separately control\r\n\r\nand audit these accounts, and report the results to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other proposed amendments are:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Appointment of an acting President of MUIS in the event\r\n\r\nof a sudden vacancy of the post.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The minimum amount in issue for appeal to the Appeal\r\n\r\nBoard from the Syariah Court will be raised from $25 to $450  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage frivolous appeals.  The Appeal Board will have powers\r\n\r\nto  charge  fees.  The term of office of the Appeal  Board  will\r\n\r\nalso be increased from one to two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The penalties for teaching false doctrine or deviant\r\n\r\nteachings  will be increased from $500 to $2,000 to serve  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the amendments proposed in this Bill will\r\n\r\nstrengthen  MUIS  and the Syariah Court.  We  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  development of both these  institutions  and  make\r\n\r\nchanges where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discussed the amendments carefully with my\r\n\r\nMalay MP colleagues and I have their support.  My colleagues and\r\n\r\nI  understand and empathise with the aspirations of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.  We know too that the Muslim community's reaction  to\r\n\r\nchanges  to AMLA is generally positive although there  are  some\r\n\r\nconcerns  over  certain  amendments particularly  on  concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction.  I have received much feedback from the community.\r\n\r\nTo give these views a chance to be aired, heard and considered I\r\n\r\nshall commit the Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin  Saniff) (In Malay):  Sir, I stand up to support  the\r\n\r\namendment proposed by the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we are going to debate on the issue of amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very significant to AMLA which has been in  existence\r\n\r\nsince 1968.  There are two areas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  importance and should be given due attention.  Firstly, with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  expanding power of MUIS and the  Syariah  court\r\n\r\nespecially;  and  the  other,  the parallel  power  between  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court and the Civil Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support fully the proposal of the Minister that the\r\n\r\namendments should be refined by the Select Committee.  The Malay\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  should study closely the  existing  power  of\r\n\r\nMUIS,  covering  the  performance of haj,  halal  food  and  the\r\n\r\nissuance of certificates, joint ventures and the appointment  of\r\n\r\nPresident of MUIS, etc.  This should be refined, even  though  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  are  many  others who will  pay  more  attention\r\n\r\ntowards  the parallel power of the Syariah Court and  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to touch on this very sensitive issue.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  both these two courts (Syariah Court and Civil  Court)\r\n\r\nhave been utilised by the Malay Muslim community.  Previously it\r\n\r\nwas  not  encoded  in AMLA.  Now it has been  encoded  in  AMLA.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  though it has been encoded, the choice is up  to  the\r\n\r\nrights of the Malay Muslim community themselves.  The Government\r\n\r\nor  the  Civil  Court has no power to force.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  here  that  this chapter, ie, the Civil  Court  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have no power to force. Thirdly, the cases of Salijah\r\n\r\nv.  Abdullah  Teo and Lathibaby could be one of the  reasons  to\r\n\r\nhave this parallel amendment.  Fourthly, the concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps seem to be tidy and smooth with the intention\r\n\r\nto  confer rights to the Singapore society as a whole.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  system  that  is  solid,  as  found   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Civil Court, for instance, having a longer\r\n\r\nhistory,  and  very systematic, that may influence many  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  those who do not understand fully and may  take  the\r\n\r\neasy  way out by going to the Civil Court without due regard  to\r\n\r\nother  avenues.   Indirectly,  this  problem  can  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nembarrass the Syariah Court or the Islamic law. Then people will\r\n\r\nstart\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npointing  fingers  at  the amendment, even  though  without  any\r\n\r\nmalicious intent from anyone to slur anybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too with having the additional President of the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  purpose is to assist in settling the  long  waiting\r\n\r\nlist,  ie, from Syariah Court to Toa Payoh and these people  may\r\n\r\nfall  into  committing  other evil deeds  because  of  the  long\r\n\r\nwaiting  list and this will cause more problems.  There  may  be\r\n\r\nothers  who will think that if that is not enough, why not  have\r\n\r\none  more Syariah Court so that you do not have to refer to  the\r\n\r\nCivil Court.  I believe these matters must be resolved with  due\r\n\r\ncare by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some realities must be understood. Firstly, the parallel\r\n\r\npower  may be taken as a problem.  The power between the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  and the Civil Court can be seen as a problem whereas  the\r\n\r\ntrue  problem  is within ourselves, the Muslim  community.   The\r\n\r\nproblem  of the Malay Muslim community is with regard  to  their\r\n\r\nmoral  principles.  Thus, the Syariah Court  has  a  problem  to\r\n\r\nsettle  their matters as well as the Civil Court.   However,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Malay-Muslim  community fully value and appreciate  Islamic\r\n\r\nlaws and the teachings of their Prophet, maintaining harmony  of\r\n\r\nfamilyhood, there is a possibility that the Civil Court may  not\r\n\r\nbe  used at all, nor even the addition of the President  of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  will be needed.  This is the real  problem.   We\r\n\r\nhave to rectify  ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Koran it is stated: \"This day I have perfected your\r\n\r\nreligion  for  you and completed thy favour unto you,  and  have\r\n\r\nchosen for you as religion Al-Islam.\"  Islam is encompassing and\r\n\r\ncomplete.  We have to equip ourselves with Islam.  The  Almighty\r\n\r\nalso  has stated that there is cure to every sickness, there  is\r\n\r\nanswer  to  every  question and solution to  every  problem.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not  blame anyone.  We ourselves must sort out  our  own\r\n\r\nproblems.   This  is also a challenge for us,  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nsolidify our belief and approach of \"removing wrongdoings  takes\r\n\r\nprecedence  over introducing new benefits\". In line  with  this,\r\n\r\nseveral regulated or systemic steps should be undertaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a conscientious effort must be undertaken so that\r\n\r\nteachings  of  Islam will be fully appreciated by the  community\r\n\r\nand  that they will carry out what is required of them and  will\r\n\r\nnot  do that is not required of them.  The inculcation of  self-evangelism  or  dakwah  and  tabligh  plan  must  be  undertaken\r\n\r\ninvolving all Islamic institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the credibility and character of the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt must be kept and maintained so that only those having  the\r\n\r\nexpertise  will  be chosen, particularly for  the  post  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Syariah Court.  The deep understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  of the Koran is very urgent and cogent so  that  there\r\n\r\nwill be no other misinterpretation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all Islamic scholars, Islamic leaders and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  must  cooperate  to  contribute  their  knowledge\r\n\r\nleading to the Islamic resurgence so that its followers will not\r\n\r\nbe  misunderstood by non-Muslims without regard to situation and\r\n\r\ncondition.  In fact, contributions from these Muslims are  being\r\n\r\nexpected  and hoped for as had been done by the Prophet  himself\r\n\r\ntowards  the  Jews and the Christians in Medina  which  made  it\r\n\r\npossible for the existence of the Medina Charter or Declaration.\r\n\r\nThat was the first early charter of Human Rights which was multi-racial, multi-religious, full of tolerance and harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to think that the\r\n\r\namendment  of  AMLA  in relation to the parallel  power  of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court to the Civil Court is something that is temporal.\r\n\r\nIt is an emergency.  It is not something that will be permanent.\r\n\r\nWhat  is permanent to me is a unique cooperation among  us.   An\r\n\r\nimportant cooperation between two unique institutions, to ensure\r\n\r\npeace,  harmony of its community.  Hopefully, this will  not  go\r\n\r\noverboard  of  its  religion  in  this  unique  country.    This\r\n\r\nuniqueness,   if  channelled  properly  can  give   us   benefit\r\n\r\ntremendously  especially if it is less controversial  or  better\r\n\r\nstill  if  there is no controversy at all.  Then it  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsweet  symbol of tolerance in a multi-racial community which  is\r\n\r\ndynamic and sophisticated.  The propensity of this thing will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecome  an impetus that will bring the Singapore community  that\r\n\r\nis unique to a new millennium with a new burning spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I thank you very much for giving me the chance  to\r\n\r\nspeak in support of the Administration of Muslim Law (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill,  which  has  been proposed by the Minister  for  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Minister  in  charge  of  Muslim  Affairs,  Mr\r\n\r\nAbdullah Tarmugi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the Administration of Muslim Law Act\r\n\r\n(AMLA)  is  long  overdue and timely.  Now,  that  it  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough for years a process of thinking and formulation,  it  is\r\n\r\nnow before us for our common good.  Its passage seems to be very\r\n\r\nrough  because of the many controversies enveloping it.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  without  blessing though.  Hopefully, all of us  will  gain\r\n\r\nenlightenment through this exchange of ideas, be  it  inside  or\r\n\r\noutside the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I support the decision of Minister\r\n\r\nAbdullah  Tarmugi to propose that the Bill be sent to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  It is also my hope that the opportunity and the time\r\n\r\ngiven  will  be  used fully for all parties  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nbackground  of  the  thinking  behind  the  effort  to  do  this\r\n\r\namendment,  particularly with regard to the  parallel  power  of\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court and the Civil Court; it should be seen  not  only\r\n\r\nfrom an ideal principle perspective but also the reality of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.   If  we  were  to pay too  much  importance  to  its\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  not  its practicality,  at  least  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  the present needs and conditions, we will face problems\r\n\r\nin finding solutions  to the problems which we face now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, as a Muslim, I would wish the power that is bestowed\r\n\r\non the Syariah Court to be absolute, but if this were to be done\r\n\r\nnow, the question we have to ask ourselves is: will it assist us\r\n\r\nor  otherwise?   Every Muslim would want to look for  blessings,\r\n\r\nbut  what  must be done wisely is that it must be practical  and\r\n\r\nsuitable to the conditions in the context of the history of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  society which includes being multi-racial and  multi-religious.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage to look for the ideal model to implement a\r\n\r\nMuslim  way of life is indeed far and long.  It must be done  in\r\n\r\nstages.    It  is  better  to  be  slow  but  steady.    Islamic\r\n\r\ngovernments,  countries or Muslim majority communities  are  not\r\n\r\none as to which model accurately fulfills their needs.  This can\r\n\r\nbe seen in the economic, political or even social system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, my experience since 1973,\r\n\r\nabout  25  years  ago,  since attending the International  Youth\r\n\r\nConference  in  Libya, making research and  studies  as  to  how\r\n\r\nIslamic   governments   and  countries  and   minority   Islamic\r\n\r\ncommunities   handled   these  issues.  They   include   Islamic\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in the Middle East, and the Islamic revolution  in\r\n\r\nIran, Islam and secularism in Turkey, Malay/Muslim community  in\r\n\r\nSouth  Africa, Pancasila and Islam in Indonesia and the thinking\r\n\r\nand  process of Islamisation of UMNO and PAS in Malaysia, simply\r\n\r\nshow how varied these examples are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Islamic world is at variance. In fact, they develop\r\n\r\nanimosity between one another in their search for a solution  as\r\n\r\nto  how to imbue Islamic values and system of administration. In\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN region, through the cooperation of Mabims, (unofficial\r\n\r\ncooperation among the Religious Councils of Indonesia, Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  Brunei)  there  are  efforts  towards   finding\r\n\r\nconvergence and to learn different experiences from one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be proud that even though Singapore is generally\r\n\r\na  secular  country, Islam has an important  place  in  society.\r\n\r\nTogether  with other religions, Islam is encouraged to  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant role that is positive and constructive.  The existence\r\n\r\nof  MUIS  as  a  statutory body bears  testimony  to  that.   In\r\n\r\naddition, the Registry of Muslim Marriages and the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nplay an important role with regard to the questions of marriages\r\n\r\nand other ancillary matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handle these matters is being seen by others,\r\n\r\nMuslims and non-Muslims in and outside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is an important process.  It is a test for us to show  how\r\n\r\nIslam  and  the  Islamic  community can live  harmoniously  even\r\n\r\nthough Singapore generally is a secular country.  The system  of\r\n\r\nadministration  and development programmes  that  are  found  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  an example for other minority Muslim  communities\r\n\r\nthroughout the world.  In fact, there are also countries with an\r\n\r\nIslamic  majority which may want to learn our system of  Islamic\r\n\r\nadministration.   Examples  which  I  can  put  forward  is  the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  MUIS,  the  question  of  construction   and\r\n\r\nadministration  of  mosques, the system of halal  certification,\r\n\r\nmarriage  registry and also the Syariah Court. We must pay  high\r\n\r\nregard  to  these good examples.  Our community has  taken  bold\r\n\r\nsteps  in  many areas.  Ideas and programmes for the development\r\n\r\nof  the Islamic community have borne results.  I believe and  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that we will continue to be able to show examples  of\r\n\r\ngood systems and ideas as to how to live in a secular and plural\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the amendment of AMLA, particularly for MUIS and\r\n\r\nthe   Syariah   Court,  the  positions  of  these  two   Islamic\r\n\r\ninstitutions can be strengthened.  For MUIS, although its  scope\r\n\r\nof  work  has  expanded  and  MUIS has  undertaken  more  tasks,\r\n\r\nincluding the management of the performance of haj, issuance  of\r\n\r\nhalal  certificates, wakaf development, family  development  and\r\n\r\nvarious socio-economic projects, AMLA does not reflect that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment, the position of MUIS, as the supreme\r\n\r\nbody of Islam in Singapore, will be `formalised'.  MUIS by right\r\n\r\nshould  expand its role in line with the needs of the times  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of the community.  However, MUIS must be  realistic\r\n\r\nin  fulfilling these hopes to avoid a situation where  (a  Malay\r\n\r\nproverb)  it  fails to get what it wants and at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nloses  what is already at hand.  MUIS must be given the  support\r\n\r\nfor  manpower, particularly professionals who can shoulder  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  MUIS should be given the power which  is  wide-ranging  and  strengthened  with  even  bigger  resources.   The\r\n\r\ncommunity must show\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  support  by giving more contributions  to  zakat  or  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment fund of the mosques.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of the Syariah Court, if we\r\n\r\nwere  to look closely at the real situation, I am confident that\r\n\r\nthe  amendments bring more benefits than weaknesses.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  clarified  by Mr Abdullah Tarmugi earlier.   However,  the\r\n\r\nproblem that has arisen, in fact a cause for controversy, is the\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction conferred on the Civil Court  to  handle\r\n\r\nsome aspects of divorce, including custody, maintenance and  the\r\n\r\ndivision  of  matrimonial  property.   This,  as  stated  by  Mr\r\n\r\nAbdullah Tarmugi, is not a new thing.  In fact, there were  many\r\n\r\nother  such cases that were settled with the help of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment, the power of the Civil Court to carry\r\n\r\nout this task will be `formalised'.  There will no longer be any\r\n\r\ncontroversy as to whether the Civil Court has the power  or  not\r\n\r\nto   handle   the  matter.  The  situation  in  the   past   was\r\n\r\nembarrassing.  Some people were saying as though we had no shame\r\n\r\nto  ask  when  we were not welcome.  But with this amendment  it\r\n\r\nwill be official.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely help. This is another alternative\r\n\r\navenue  to handle the cases.  Nevertheless, the concern of  some\r\n\r\nsections of society is also true as the ground for settling  the\r\n\r\ncases is based on a different basis of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, whilst we accept the concurrent system, we\r\n\r\nshould also monitor these cases so that the issue of conflicting\r\n\r\nlaws could be avoided.  The differences should also be explained\r\n\r\nto  the community so that they will be more responsible in their\r\n\r\ndecision-making in order to resolve their problems. Besides, the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Syariah Court is empowered not to grant  leave\r\n\r\nto  the  cases which it thinks need the attention of the Syariah\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the process to enhance the resources of the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt must continue.  In fact, it should be actively pursued  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  time will come when the Syariah Court can handle  all\r\n\r\nthese cases.  However, until we reach that stage,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  must be realistic by taking this middle path. It may not  be\r\n\r\nideal  but  it  will ensure that we can cope with  the  problems\r\n\r\nahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that the resources in the Civil Court are\r\n\r\nalso  our country's resources too.  We must know how to  utilise\r\n\r\nit  if  it  can  fulfil  the needs of the  Muslim  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Not all cases that can be handled by the Civil  Court\r\n\r\nwill  be in conflict with the Islamic tenets.  For these  cases,\r\n\r\nthe facilities of the Civil Court should be used together by the\r\n\r\nMuslim   community.   These  resources  belong  to  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, these amendments have been initiated with the\r\n\r\nintention to improve the situation.  The aim is noble.  Although\r\n\r\nnot  ideal and perfect, it should be seen as a temporary way out\r\n\r\nor  as  an  emergency  way  out,  while  the  Syariah  Court  is\r\n\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  firstly,  I  would  like to  express  that  we  have  made\r\n\r\nconsiderable progress and many laudable developments  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced to the amendment of AMLA during its First Reading  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  on  20th April 1998.  What is  clear  is  that  the\r\n\r\namendments will provide various ways for MUIS to carry  out  and\r\n\r\nwiden its role more effectively.  Among others, as explained  by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Community  Development  and  the   Minister\r\n\r\nresponsible for Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi earlier, the\r\n\r\namendments  will  allow  MUIS  to form  or  participate  in  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  companies, joint-ventures or  partnerships.  MUIS\r\n\r\nwill  also  be vested with the proper powers to deal with  Halal\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more crucial, I believe, is the fact that the\r\n\r\namendments involve the enhancement of powers and capabilities of\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah  Court. Under the proposed amendments  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  will  continue  to  retain  exclusive  jurisdiction  over\r\n\r\nmatters,  such  as  marriage  issues,  divorce,  dissolution  of\r\n\r\nengagements, dissolution of marriages and divorce orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these exclusive powers, the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nwill  also be bestowed with five additional powers, as described\r\n\r\nin the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the additional powers in the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment are intended to strengthen the authority  of\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah  Court  so  that  it can  exercise  its  role  more\r\n\r\neffectively.  However, I feel that some of the proposed  changes\r\n\r\nmay  have  contributed to some confusion. What  I  mean  is  the\r\n\r\nparallel  or  concurrent jurisdiction which allows  Muslims  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of seeking remedy in ancillary matters, such as  custody\r\n\r\nand  maintenance  claims  and division of  matrimonial  property\r\n\r\neither at the Syariah Court or the Civil Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for the amendment to the Act arises among\r\n\r\nothers,  from  the case of Mdm Salijah Abdul Latif and  Abdullah\r\n\r\nTeo  in  1993   for  the  division of  matrimonial  property  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by Mr Abdullah Tarmugi.  Two years later, the case was\r\n\r\nbrought  to the High Court before Justice Prakash who held  that\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court had no jurisdiction on the matter. Mdm  Salijah\r\n\r\nappealed  but  the  Appeal Court agreed  with  the  decision  of\r\n\r\nJustice Prakash.  Subsequently, the High Court rejected two more\r\n\r\ncases  involving Muslim couples and these decisions  closed  the\r\n\r\navenue   for  Muslim  divorcing  couples  to  seek  remedy   and\r\n\r\nresolution at the Civil Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Syariah Court is created because of\r\n\r\nits  status  in  AMLA.   AMLA confers the jurisdiction  that  it\r\n\r\npossesses and the High Court itself concurred  that it does  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  right to interfere in cases involving Muslim couples.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  opportune for us and all those  involved  to\r\n\r\nconsider  deeply  and  thoroughly  how  the  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nAdministration of Muslim Law Act can enable the Syariah Court to\r\n\r\nresolve   problems  and  issues  of  divorcing  Muslim   couples\r\n\r\neffectively,  especially in the areas of  matrimonial  property,\r\n\r\nmaintenance and custody of children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's context, the issues of matrimonial property,\r\n\r\ncustody and maintenance are not peripheral matters any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore.  They are becoming more the core and crucial issues which,\r\n\r\nmore often than not, are matters for contention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have the Civil Courts, I believe a more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   solution   which  takes   account   of   Islamic\r\n\r\nconsiderations  can  only be obtained by  couples  choosing  the\r\n\r\navenue  of  the  Syariah Court.  This includes the  question  of\r\n\r\ncustody,  division of property, apostasy of  couples,  rules  of\r\n\r\nevidence,  and  other regulations. It is these very  differences\r\n\r\nthat led to the creation of the Syariah Court meant to specially\r\n\r\nhandle Muslim cases relating to the Syariah laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must see this development as an effort\r\n\r\nto  give enhanced recognition and authority to the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nso  that the amendment to the AMLA will fulfil and overcome  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  and limitations that are inherent in  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.  Hence,  the amendment to AMLA in this  connection,  must\r\n\r\ntake into account the long-term implications.  The amendments to\r\n\r\nAMLA should, as much as feasible, provide the Syariah Court with\r\n\r\nsufficient  jurisdiction  to  enable  it  to  act  independently\r\n\r\naccording to the tenets of Islam, in line with the needs of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community.  We must anticipate more complicated problems\r\n\r\nto  emerge in future and as such, should properly equip that the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court with relevant powers of jurisdiction  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community from being trapped  again  in  a  similar\r\n\r\nsituation in the future.  Therefore, it is incumbent  on  us  to\r\n\r\nexplore  new approaches so that in the long term, Muslim couples\r\n\r\nneed  only  go to the Syariah Court to resolve their matrimonial\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that Muslims in Singapore have made\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  in the Civil Court since 1968.  But  it  must  be\r\n\r\nborne  in mind that this is so because they really did not  have\r\n\r\nmuch  choice,  owing to the shortcomings of  the  Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nwhich  was  seen  to  be less effective compared  to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the proposed amendments to the AMLA are laudable\r\n\r\nas it will help in reducing the backlog of long standing divorce\r\n\r\ncases and also other cases that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  remained  unresolved for a long period.  Undoubtedly,  the\r\n\r\nproposed concurrent jurisdiction of allowing Muslims to have the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  resolving their ancillary claims in the Civil  Court\r\n\r\ncan  speed up many of these outstanding cases.  This is possible\r\n\r\nbecause  of the efficient machinery, manpower and the  mechanism\r\n\r\nthat  are readily available in the Civil Court.  Because of  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings in the Syariah Court today, this opportunity can be\r\n\r\nmaximised fully.  In other words, Muslim couples can refer their\r\n\r\ncases   to  the  Civil  Courts  so  that  the  outstanding   and\r\n\r\ncomplicated cases can be resolved quickly. This  could  continue\r\n\r\nuntil  such  time  when  the situation (in  the  Syariah  Court)\r\n\r\nimproves and is more manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach, in my view, although effective, should be\r\n\r\nemployed in the short- term or temporarily only, while  we  work\r\n\r\ntowards  equipping  and beefing up the Syariah  Court  with  the\r\n\r\nproper manpower, management systems, mechanism, expertise and so\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I feel the Government itself could feel proud if in\r\n\r\nthe midst of a plural and secular society, Singapore is able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  credible Syariah Court. Since the amendment  to  AMLA\r\n\r\naffects  the various aspects of life of the Muslim community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I think it would be proper for it to be carried  out\r\n\r\nby  consultation,  taking  into account  the  views  of  various\r\n\r\nquarters  in  the Muslim community in Singapore,  including  the\r\n\r\nMuslim intellectuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I am happy that the amendment to AMLA will\r\n\r\nbe  referred to a Select Committee as revealed by the  Minister,\r\n\r\nMr  Abdullah Tarmugi, earlier so that it can be looked  at  more\r\n\r\nthoroughly,  with  considered views  of  the  community.   These\r\n\r\nefforts  and endeavours will lead to the creation and upliftment\r\n\r\nof  the  status of the Syariah Court  in the long term,  and  if\r\n\r\nfound  feasible,  a  status change from a tribunal  to  a  full-fledged  court  which  is  capable of handling  all  matrimonial\r\n\r\nissues involving Muslim couples without having to resort to  the\r\n\r\nCivil Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment to AMLA\r\n\r\npresented by Minister Abdullah Tarmugi.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this is the Malay language month.  I will begin my  speech\r\n\r\nwith  a  Malay pantun.  Roughly, it means that since Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nhas  given  the  chance, many will be speaking and we anticipate\r\n\r\nthat it will attract a lot of criticisms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the Amendment Bill. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is long overdue.   Thus, I congratulate Mr  Abdullah\r\n\r\nTarmugi for having the courage to bring this Bill to Parliament.\r\n\r\nAnd  when  the Act is amended, it will bring much  good  to  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community and no power is forcing it upon us to accept it\r\n\r\nif  the  amendment is bad.  Of course, I think our Minister  has\r\n\r\ndiscussed  with all his Parliamentary colleagues to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsmooth  passage of the Bill so that the Bill can be accepted  by\r\n\r\nall  levels of society.  Unfortunately, the final word from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  that  he  wants to bring this  Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   Of  course, I feel that the  Minister  wishes  more\r\n\r\npeople from the Muslim community to voice their problems through\r\n\r\nconsultation.   I  think, prior to that,  the  Muslim  Religious\r\n\r\nCouncil  must  play  its  role  by calling  upon  all  religious\r\n\r\nscholars and Muslim bodies to come to an agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, many matters have been touched on by our\r\n\r\ncolleagues  earlier and many are of the view that a  controversy\r\n\r\nwill  arise  regarding the issue of the Syariah  Court  and  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Courts.   The  Minister  said  that,  without  having  it\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  the law, the Muslim community has already  sought\r\n\r\nredress in  the Family Court.  For example, in 1996, there  were\r\n\r\n2,445  families; in 1997, 2,401 families.  And in the six months\r\n\r\nof  this  year,  there were 1,407 families.   That  is,  without\r\n\r\nhaving  it  enshrined  in the law, there were  already  so  many\r\n\r\ncases.   So  I think that is a problem with the Muslim community\r\n\r\nand it should not be enshrined by allowing the Muslims to go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Courts.  Indirectly, the image of the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected.  To me, we should leave the section  in  its\r\n\r\nstatus quo.  That is my view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because, without having it enshrined in the law,\r\n\r\nthere are already so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany Muslims going to the Civil Courts.  And if you are going to\r\n\r\nhave it as a law, it is as if we are saying that Muslims can  go\r\n\r\nto  the Civil Courts and ignore the Syariah Court.  That is  the\r\n\r\nview  of  some  people.   We should look at  this  problem  more\r\n\r\nthoroughly although the parallel jurisdiction is provided to the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court and the Civil Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may arise a situation in which the two courts,\r\n\r\nhaving  parallel  jurisdiction, may  pass  different  decisions.\r\n\r\nAnd,  at the end of the day, we will have an orange sour on  one\r\n\r\nhalf, ie, sour on the side of one court and sweet on the side of\r\n\r\nthe  other  court.   The  ones who will lose  will  be  our  own\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I commend the proposal by the Minister to bring\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill to a Select Committee because he feels that\r\n\r\nthis  is an opportunity and chance for the Muslim bodies, Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  scholars, experts, especially those who are  experts\r\n\r\nin  legal  matters, to come together to look into this  Bill  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  amendments proposed will have the  agreement  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Administration of Muslim Law  Act  (AMLA)  is\r\n\r\nindeed very comprehensive and wide-ranging.  It covers two major\r\n\r\ninstitutions  governing  Muslim life in Singapore,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nIslamic  courts,  better  known as the Syariah  Court,  and  the\r\n\r\nMuslim Religious Council of Singapore, better know by its  Malay\r\n\r\nacronym, MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment constitutes the first major amendment to AMLA\r\n\r\nsince  its inception more than 30 years ago.   AMLA was approved\r\n\r\nin  this House on 17th August 1966 after it was sent to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  In 1975, changes were made to allow Muslims to  make\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Mosque Building Fund via the CPF check  off\r\n\r\nsystem.   Two  review committees were formed: one  in  1985  and\r\n\r\nanother in 1992.  These committees recognised the need to  close\r\n\r\nsome  gaps in the existing legislation and to provide new powers\r\n\r\nto key Islamic institutions to keep up with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  changing Muslim population in Singapore.  However, in closing\r\n\r\nthese gaps, careful deliberation was also needed given the  very\r\n\r\nsensitive nature of any attempt to change matters pertaining  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Muslim institutional framework.  I  must  therefore\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister  in charge  of  Muslim  Affairs,  Mr\r\n\r\nAbdullah  Tarmugi, for finally closing the loop  after  13  long\r\n\r\nyears.   We, as a community, had to  close the gaps.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changes to MUIS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the changes the amendment makes to MUIS\r\n\r\nare  indeed welcome.  The move to empower MUIS to regulate halal\r\n\r\ncertification and pilgrimage or haj reflects the need to  better\r\n\r\nmanage  changing expectations within the community.   Many  food\r\n\r\noutlets  in Singapore have recognised the growing Muslim  market\r\n\r\nand  have  turned halal in order to attract this market.   MUIS'\r\n\r\nnew  role  in  the  regulation  of  halal  certification  should\r\n\r\nreassure   the  Muslim  community  that  outlets   with    halal\r\n\r\ncertification are halal throughout their operations.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nwith  this  amendment, MUIS will have the power to regulate  and\r\n\r\npenalise  travel  agents  offering  haj  packages.   With  these\r\n\r\nchanges,  Muslim pilgrims will be better protected and they  can\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  the  rituals without  worrying  about  flights,\r\n\r\nhotel,  meal  service, ground transportation and  other  related\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment would also allow MUIS to form companies to\r\n\r\ndevelop  fully its assets, especially its vast land bank,  which\r\n\r\nit   holds  under  wakaf   or  trust.   The  role  of  wakaf  is\r\n\r\nessentially charitable.  Properties remain in perpetuity but the\r\n\r\nprofits  are  channelled to help charitable  institutions.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  has assured us that MUIS will not be directly involved\r\n\r\nin the running of these companies.  However, the amendment gives\r\n\r\nMUIS  an  avenue  of  ensuring that  its  assets  are  optimally\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  This will ultimately benefit the community at large.\r\n\r\nThese  changes,  as  I  said earlier, are a  reflection  of  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  expectations of the community and  of  the  community's\r\n\r\nexpectations that MUIS plays a greater and effective role in the\r\n\r\naffairs  of the community.  Hence I support totally the  changes\r\n\r\nto MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changes to Syariah Court</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment also has a major impact on the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt,  which is empowered to deal with Muslim personal  matters\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Over the years, many Muslims have resorted to the\r\n\r\nCivil  Court  to seek enforcement of judgments.   We  frequently\r\n\r\nhear  about  the problems Muslim women and their  children  face\r\n\r\nwhen  husbands  refuse to sign the transfer  documents  for  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial home.  Often, these women do not have the  financial\r\n\r\nresources  to  set up a household on their own.   The  amendment\r\n\r\nwould  allow  the Syariah Court President to sign  the  transfer\r\n\r\ndocuments  if the husband fails to do so after being instructed.\r\n\r\nThis  is a significant move towards reducing the financial  pain\r\n\r\nand  anguish  which  has too often been associated  with  Muslim\r\n\r\ndivorces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key change made by this amendment is the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of  section 53.  With this  change,  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  now  can  make  use of the infrastructure  of  the  civil\r\n\r\njustice  system  to  punish errant couples.   Section  53  gives\r\n\r\npowers to the court to jail anyone refusing to comply with court\r\n\r\norders.  However, making use of these powers requires an  entire\r\n\r\nsupport  system.   For  example, the setting  up  of  bonds  and\r\n\r\nservices  of  a bailiff are needed in order to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\njailed person's rights are observed.  The Syariah Court does not\r\n\r\nhave  these facilities.  With this amendment, the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\ncan tap into the existing resources of our justice system.  This\r\n\r\napproach should be seen as an opportunity for the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nto develop further its own strength and human resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the most significant change this\r\n\r\namendment would bring is the adoption of the so-called  parallel\r\n\r\njurisdiction  approach.  A couple, as mentioned by the  Minister\r\n\r\nearlier, can now choose to proceed to either the Civil Court  or\r\n\r\nremain  in  the Syariah Court after a divorce has been  granted.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, ancillary matters such as custody, maintenance and\r\n\r\nthe  disposal of the matrimonial home can now be dealt  with  in\r\n\r\neither the Civil Court or the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever, to proceed to the Civil Court, both parties, ie, the ex-husband  and  ex-wife, would have to agree to  do  so.   If  the\r\n\r\ncouple does not agree to do so, the party wishing to proceed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Court  can apply for leave from  the  Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nPresident  to  grant  them permission to proceed  to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.   For  the House's information, and as mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier,  Muslim couples have in the  past  chosen  to\r\n\r\nproceed to the civil courts.  However, this avenue was closed as\r\n\r\na  result  of  the case of Madam Salijah Latif.  This  amendment\r\n\r\nrestores  this avenue.  The question is whether re-opening  this\r\n\r\navenue  is  the  right  thing  to do.   The  so-called  parallel\r\n\r\njurisdiction  approach this amendment adopts  has  raised  fears\r\n\r\nthat it will dilute Islamic law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the practical impact this amendment will\r\n\r\nhave  in greater detail.  Would a Muslim couple be given similar\r\n\r\njustice  if they proceed to the Civil Court instead of remaining\r\n\r\nin  the Syariah Court in the case of an amicable divorce?  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  a  lawyer.  But I believe both the Syariah and Civil Courts\r\n\r\nwould  take into account the interests of the wife, husband  and\r\n\r\nchildren  in  making decisions pertaining to ancillary  matters.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, Muslim couples would not be short changed if they\r\n\r\nproceed  to  the Civil Court.  Hence, with this amendment,  such\r\n\r\ncouples  would have more legal avenues and would likely be  able\r\n\r\nto  resolve  ancillary matters in a shorter time.  A divorce  is\r\n\r\nnever  easy.  The sooner the couple and the children can get  on\r\n\r\nwith  their  lives, the better it will be for all  parties.   So\r\n\r\nunder what circumstances would different legal outcomes arise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are instances where the outcome under\r\n\r\nIslamic  law  is  different from the outcome  under  civil  law.\r\n\r\nConsider  the  following example.  The husband  renounces  Islam\r\n\r\nafter the divorce.  If the couple has a young child, it is  very\r\n\r\nlikely  that the Syariah Court would grant custody to the Muslim\r\n\r\nwife.  But what happens if the non-Muslim husband makes a better\r\n\r\nparent?  What happens if the Muslim party is a drug addict?   In\r\n\r\nsuch  a case, the Civil Court would most likely give custody  to\r\n\r\nthe responsible parent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOf  course, when the Syariah  Court grants custody to the Muslim\r\n\r\nparent,  I  believe it takes the view that the  raising  of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  according to Islam is to be done  by  the  family  and\r\n\r\ncommunity and not only by the parent.  The Minister has given us\r\n\r\nthe  assurance  that  the  religion  of  the  children  will  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  by the Civil Court.  Perhaps the public  is  looking\r\n\r\nfor further guarantees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Islam, conduct is an important criterion in determining\r\n\r\ncustody.  A bad wife, as an example, is unlikely to gain custody\r\n\r\nof the child.  In the civil system, conduct is quite immaterial.\r\n\r\nAn  adulterous  wife may be given custody of the child.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthis  is  another instance where you may get a different  ruling\r\n\r\nfrom the Civil and Syariah Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these differences, great pains will need to be\r\n\r\ntaken to address the concerns recently raised about the dilution\r\n\r\nof  Islamic law under the amendment.  In particular, we need  to\r\n\r\nexamine carefully whether the amendment provides for an adequate\r\n\r\ngate-keeping  mechanism  to  prevent  such  differing  outcomes.\r\n\r\nRequiring  a  couple that disagrees on proceeding to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt  to  apply for leave from the Syariah Court can, in  fact,\r\n\r\nwork   to   ensure  that  problematic  cases  are   dealt   with\r\n\r\nappropriately  in  the Syariah Court. But  this  raises  another\r\n\r\nconcern.  While I believe that it is good to give powers to  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court to decide on leave applications, it is  important\r\n\r\nthat  we  make this process transparent.  Could we not  consider\r\n\r\noutlining some conditions under which leave could be granted  or\r\n\r\notherwise?   While I am confident that the Syariah Court  judges\r\n\r\nwould  decide  such  applications  wisely,  I  am  sure  that  a\r\n\r\ntransparent process would reassure the community that leave will\r\n\r\nnot be granted solely in the interest of bureaucratic expediency\r\n\r\nand not on the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment also makes the Muslim couple\r\n\r\nresponsible for deciding which system they want their case to be\r\n\r\nheard  in.   I  believe this is a very good approach.  Divorcing\r\n\r\ncouples must be made aware of the repercussions of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndivorce, especially on the children.  The amendment would  allow\r\n\r\nthe  divorcing  couple to decide which legal avenue  would  most\r\n\r\neffectively  serve their personal and children's interest.   But\r\n\r\nmeasures  must be taken to ensure that the Syariah Court's  role\r\n\r\nin  divorce  proceedings is not undermined by our  ever  growing\r\n\r\nhunger for expedient quick fixes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is a very unique institution. The\r\n\r\nlawyers who appear before the judge are trained in civil law and\r\n\r\nnot  in  Islamic law.  The judge, however, is trained in Islamic\r\n\r\nlaw.   This anomaly perhaps reflects our position as a  minority\r\n\r\nMuslim  community within a larger multi-racial, multi-religious,\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural society where the law of the land is not based on\r\n\r\nany  religion.  Hence, Sir, in reflecting upon the  impact  this\r\n\r\namendment  will have on the Syariah Court, I have  thought  more\r\n\r\nbroadly  about  the position the Syariah Court  has  within  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the larger legal system in Singapore.  The  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt plays a special role.  It occupies an institutional niche,\r\n\r\ndealing  as it does with Muslim personal matters - a substantive\r\n\r\narea  which other courts do not have the professional competency\r\n\r\nto  operate  in.  This amendment establishes a stronger  linkage\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Syariah  Court and the  broader  legal  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Under  it, the Syariah Court can  more  easily  and\r\n\r\nfully tap the expertise and resources of our legal system.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  could we not find ways to make the link stronger?  With  a\r\n\r\nstronger  link,  for example, the training and the  professional\r\n\r\ncareer  track  opportunities of the Syariah Court  judges  could\r\n\r\nmore  closely mirror those of the judges and legal staff  within\r\n\r\nthe  broader  legal system.  The sharing of resources  would  be\r\n\r\nmore  complete and comprehensive and could include the  location\r\n\r\nof the Syariah Court within the same legal complex as the Family\r\n\r\nand other Civil Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe this amendment in its net effect is\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  the Muslim community.  Some have criticised  the\r\n\r\namendment, arguing for the creation of a separate Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nsystem unto itself.  Creating an entirely separate system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould   not  only  demand  very  large  financial  outlays   but\r\n\r\nsubstantial  commitments in training and recruitment.   Much  of\r\n\r\nthese  outlays  would  merely go into duplicating  services  and\r\n\r\ncompetencies  already available in the larger  legal  community.\r\n\r\nCreating  such a system would also require time.  One  needs  to\r\n\r\nask whether such outlays and commitments are the best use of our\r\n\r\nlimited resources.  The present amendment, by taking an approach\r\n\r\nwhich  taps  into existing resources, eliminates  this  resource\r\n\r\nallocation  issue.  It does, however, raise concerns  about  the\r\n\r\ndilution  of Islamic law in Singapore.  As I mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\nsafeguards are needed to address these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this amendment. The original AMLA Bill in\r\n\r\n1966  was  sent  to  a Select Committee.  I  am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  decided  to  send  this  amendment  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   It  will give the opportunity to the  wider  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  express their concerns.  It  will  also  just  as\r\n\r\nimportantly give us the chance to hear views outside this House.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with such a Bill which will affect the religious life\r\n\r\nof  the  Muslim community in Singapore, let us take  every  step\r\n\r\npossible  to ensure that the concerns of the minority community,\r\n\r\nof which I am a member, are addressed completely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, I believe this Bill is about the identity and\r\n\r\nself-confidence of a community within the context  of  a  larger\r\n\r\nSingaporean  society.  How that community,  my  community,  sees\r\n\r\nitself  is  important to all of us here today and  outside  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   If  my  community  feels that its  private  space,  its\r\n\r\nability to practise its own religious beliefs, is at risk,  then\r\n\r\nthe  common  ground  that  we share,  as  Singaporeans,  can  be\r\n\r\ndiminished.  However, if my community feels secure in the belief\r\n\r\nthat  it can be both Muslim and Singaporean, then we would  have\r\n\r\nall served the interest of the community and nation wisely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise in support of this Bill.  Since it was enacted more\r\n\r\nthan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n30  years  ago,  AMLA  has fulfilled the  needs  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore.  With AMLA, the Muslim  community  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to live comfortably and is able to progress  together\r\n\r\nwith others in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.20 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in building modern mosques, religious schools,\r\n\r\nraising funds to be distributed to different groups, development\r\n\r\nof  wakaf  land,  clearly  shows the effectiveness  of  AMLA  in\r\n\r\nbringing the community to a higher status.  The question now  is\r\n\r\nthis: is AMLA able to continue to fulfil the aspirations of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  in  facing future challenges?   I  think  the\r\n\r\namendments can be said to be a positive and progressive step  in\r\n\r\nassisting the Muslim community to face future challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realize that the Muslim community is a minority in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Like other communities, we are subject to  all  the\r\n\r\nlaws enacted in Parliament.  Although our country is based on  a\r\n\r\nsecular  system, the Muslim community is fortunate because  AMLA\r\n\r\nhas  been created specifically for the Muslim community  looking\r\n\r\nafter us in the practice of Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that AMLA does not make our community to be\r\n\r\nalienated from the lives of the larger multi-racial community in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    The  amendment  to  AMLA  this  time   is   rather\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and reflects the practical approach of the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  a plural and secular society in Singapore.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  to  section 3 gives a  clear  provision  on  the\r\n\r\nfunctions and role of the Muslim Religious Council of Singapore.\r\n\r\nMUIS,  as  the body responsible for Islamic affairs,  will  have\r\n\r\nwider powers and need therefore to raise its service to be  more\r\n\r\neffective.   To be a more effective corporate body  in  carrying\r\n\r\nout  its  responsibilities, MUIS must attract more young talents\r\n\r\nto conduct its programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professionals working in MUIS will then be able to lead\r\n\r\nthe community so that it will rise above the challenges,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially  when we approach the new millennium. In relation  to\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah Court, I support the amendment to section 35  where\r\n\r\nthe  President  of the  Republic of Singapore can  appoint  more\r\n\r\nthan  one President of the Syariah Court.  The measure  to  have\r\n\r\nmore than one President in the Syariah Court will alleviate  the\r\n\r\nexisting burden of the President of the Syariah Court. I am sure\r\n\r\nthere  are many more cases that can be quickly resolved  in  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court.  By virtue of new section 35, the position of the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court will be enhanced as a legal institution of  equal\r\n\r\nstatus  with  the Civil Court in resolving divorce  cases  among\r\n\r\nMuslim couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the additional powers to be granted to\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah  Court.  Among them is the proxy  power  where  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Syariah Court can sign documents of transfer of\r\n\r\nproperty on behalf of those who refused to do so.  There is also\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement of orders where the Syariah Court can impose  a\r\n\r\npenalty  against  those who refuse to comply  with  its  orders.\r\n\r\nWith  these  amendments and having capable staff,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  will  be able to perform its  duties  fully  and\r\n\r\nresolve  the  family  disputes  of  the  Muslim  community  more\r\n\r\neffectively in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are some quarters in the community which are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  new  sections 35A and  35B  allowing  divorced\r\n\r\nMuslim couples to choose the civil law for the determination  of\r\n\r\ncustody,  maintenance  and division of  matrimonial  properties.\r\n\r\nThey  are  fearful  that  the Islamic  law  will  not  be  given\r\n\r\nconsideration in determining the solution of these cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of Muslim couples resolving maintenance\r\n\r\nand custody matters in the civil court is not a new matter.  For\r\n\r\na  long time, many Muslim women have gone to the civil courts to\r\n\r\nobtain   maintenance  from  their  husbands.   Similarly,   with\r\n\r\ncustody.  After divorce, they have accepted the decision of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Court. This clearly shows that the Syariah Court and  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Court  have  been able together to play  a  role  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the problems of Muslim couples.  As Muslims are also subject\r\n\r\nto  the  law of the State, they cannot be prevented from seeking\r\n\r\njustice  from  the Civil Court.  I support the  move  to  enable\r\n\r\nMuslim  couples  to seek resolution in the Civil  Court  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter of custody, maintenance and division of property if  this\r\n\r\ndoes not contravene the Islamic law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister responsible for Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs  if there are any decisions of the Civil Courts  so  far\r\n\r\nthat  have been in conflict with Islamic law.  If there are any,\r\n\r\nI  believe it is the duty of the Syariah Court to advise  Muslim\r\n\r\ncouples  that  they  should  not  seek  the  solution  of  their\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  matters  in  the  Civil  Court.   Of  course,   the\r\n\r\nappropriate  action  would  be  for  the  Syariah  Court  to  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened  with  qualified officials  who  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nresolve their problems quickly.  I would also like to know  what\r\n\r\nis  the  position  of  the Mufti and the members  of  the  Fatwa\r\n\r\nCommittee on having matters resolved in the Civil Court.  If the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  currently is not able to  perform  its  duty  in\r\n\r\nresolving  the  problems  of  Muslim  couples  effectively   and\r\n\r\nquickly,  could that be made an excuse for going  to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt?  I think this must be explained more carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to the role of MUIS in the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  mosques  and madrasahs  (religious  schools)  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Muslim community generally welcomes  the  step\r\n\r\ntaken by MUIS to encourage mosques to display their accounts  to\r\n\r\nthe congregation and this will enable the congregation and other\r\n\r\nphilanthropists  to  know  the true financial  position  of  the\r\n\r\nmosques.   Mosque officials appointed by MUIS must  be  suitably\r\n\r\nqualified  residents who would therefore be able  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  duties more effectively.  The plan by MUIS  to  employ  a\r\n\r\npermanent   full   time  administrator  for  every   mosque   is\r\n\r\nappropriate in the effort to enhance the status of the mosque as\r\n\r\na  corporate body.  In the management of the religious  schools,\r\n\r\nMUIS  must  make  a decision on the structure  or  form  of  our\r\n\r\nmadrasahs.  The original aim of the madrasahs, as we know, is to\r\n\r\nprovide  indepth knowledge on Islam and for us  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nscholars\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  future.  Today, more parents are sending their children\r\n\r\nto  study  in full-time madrasahs.  Therefore, there  is  now  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  our  children  who  miss  the  chance  of  undergoing\r\n\r\neducation  in  regular schools which are, of course,  of  higher\r\n\r\nquality.  They also miss the opportunity to mix with children of\r\n\r\nother  communities.  Is this trend good for  the  community  and\r\n\r\ncountry?  That is the question that we must consider.   Can  the\r\n\r\nmadrasah graduates contribute to the economy of the country  and\r\n\r\ncan our children gain the quality education in madrasah?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim community must find the answers to these\r\n\r\nquestions and decide on the appropriate madrasah system for  our\r\n\r\nchildren.   Hence,  as  parents,  we  are  responsible  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren  and we want our children to be pious Muslims and  good\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  can  contribute to the  country  later.   As  the\r\n\r\namendment  to  AMLA must be done in the spirit  of  consultation\r\n\r\nwithin the Muslim community, I support that the Bill be referred\r\n\r\nto a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation  and  the  Arts (Encik Yatiman  Yusof):   Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion made in the  name  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of\r\n\r\nMuslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in 1995, as the Minister had earlier\r\n\r\nstated  in  his  speech, the High Court ruled that  the  Muslims\r\n\r\ninvolved  in matrimonial case could not seek a declaration  from\r\n\r\nthe  Court  of Appeal.  Then, the following year the High  Court\r\n\r\nruled   that  it  had  no  jurisdiction  to  hear  custody   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance cases involving Muslim children.  Since then,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been a backlog of cases.  The number is about 200 cases per\r\n\r\nmonth or 2,000 cases per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of dysfunctional families and the increase in\r\n\r\ndivorce  cases  is  not  peculiar to  the  Muslim  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Other communities too experience it.  However,  the\r\n\r\nproblem for the Muslims had been compounded by the fact that the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court could not handle the volume.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, the Subordinate Courts had been helpful in\r\n\r\nclearing the backlog.  The Subordinate Courts took the view that\r\n\r\nthere  were  conflicting decisions and  took  the  cases.   Now,\r\n\r\nfollowing the High Court's ruling, this is not possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what shall we do? The amendment of AMLA\r\n\r\nis  intended, inter-alia, to solve this urgent problem which  is\r\n\r\ngrowing  day  by  day,  apart  from  strengthening  the   Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council  (MUIS).   It  is  unfortunate  that   public\r\n\r\nreactions  tend  to focus on the independent and  non-concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there could be several reasons why public reactions\r\n\r\nhave been such.  The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) had\r\n\r\nbeen introduced about 30 years ago.  Since its introduction, one\r\n\r\ngeneration  had  passed  by.  New problems  and  challenges  had\r\n\r\nemerged.  The Muslim community had undergone major change.   The\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  the community had increased.  Better  education\r\n\r\nand  higher  standard  of  living had fueled  their  confidence.\r\n\r\nThus, when the proposed amendments were made known to them, they\r\n\r\naspire  for more.  They want the Syariah Court to be the supreme\r\n\r\ngoverning body over Syariah laws.  They want this position to be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, their reaction is understandable and, as\r\n\r\na  Muslim, I share their concern.  But what we need to do is  to\r\n\r\ntake into account the circumstances in which the amendments  are\r\n\r\nintroduced in this House.  However, before going into this, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  need to view the amendments in its entirety.  The Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto  amend  AMLA  (Chapter 3).  Apart from conferring  concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction  on  the  Civil Courts and  the  Syariah  Court  in\r\n\r\ncertain  matters, it also extends the function of  Majlis  Ugama\r\n\r\nIslam, Singapura, extends the powers of the Syariah Court, deals\r\n\r\nwith  halal certification, haj matters and the teaching of false\r\n\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall objective is to have a stronger and a more\r\n\r\neffective  MUIS  and to enhance the power of the Syariah  Court.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that with these amendments,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand given the strong resolve of the Muslims in Singapore, we can\r\n\r\nbe better prepared to enter the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move into the amendments involving the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court.   Why  does  the Government  choose  to  have  a\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction?  This is the question lingering in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the Muslims.  The Minister is absolutely  correct  in\r\n\r\nusing  the  analogy of a drowning person.  In other  words,  the\r\n\r\namendments  are  meant  to  tackle  problems  in  an   emergency\r\n\r\nsituation.  I wish to add a number of reasons to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even in a non-emergency situation, experience in law-making process or process of legislation in many countries\r\n\r\nshowed that the process is often an evolutionary one.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  of  no  exception.   In  our case, despite  its  origin  and\r\n\r\nhistorical roots, Islam has grown up in an independent  country.\r\n\r\nThis  being  the case, it has to embody this society in  itself,\r\n\r\nand  has to order, encourage and promote it.  It has to regulate\r\n\r\norder and regulate this society, adopting its principles and its\r\n\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that the theological beliefs of Islam\r\n\r\nare not divorced in nature, or in objective, from the day-to-day\r\n\r\nlife of the Muslims.  In fact, the way we conduct our day-to-day\r\n\r\nlife  reflects the belief and the customs of the Muslims  vis-a-vis a multi-racial environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, therefore, should be seen as part of this\r\n\r\nevolutionary  process.   As  the circumstances  change  and  new\r\n\r\ndemands  arise,  just  like other laws,  it  will  be  improved,\r\n\r\nstrengthened  and  even  changed.  In my  view,  the  concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction  is  a transitional arrangement  and  therefore  is\r\n\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we not achieve the \"ideal\" state and have the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  that  is  seen  as the supreme governing  body  over  the\r\n\r\nSyariah law?  The answer is, it is not impossible, but it  takes\r\n\r\na  long  time.   For  the time being, we  have  to  do  what  is\r\n\r\npracticable,  while we strengthen the Syariah  Court's  staffing\r\n\r\nand administrative capabilities so that they can carry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  heavier  and more complex responsibilities of  the  future.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  nation's  legal  system gains  its  great  reputation\r\n\r\nthrough similar evolutionary process.  Rome was not built  in  a\r\n\r\nday.  We need to be patient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, experience in other countries in which Muslims form\r\n\r\neither  the majority or minority population showed that  Syariah\r\n\r\nor Religious Courts can take varied forms and exist in tandem or\r\n\r\nside  by  side  with the secular legal system of the  respective\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was informed that, in Pakistan, the Syariah Courts do not\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  position as the supreme body over the Syariah  laws.\r\n\r\nThe  Pakistani Supreme Court is the supreme body over  both  the\r\n\r\nCivil  and Syariah Courts.  The Civil Courts and Syariah  Courts\r\n\r\nexist  in parallel and the Syariah Courts in Pakistan have given\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Courts concurrent jurisdiction on matters pertaining\r\n\r\nto  the  resolution of post-divorce issues.  Of course,  Islamic\r\n\r\nlaw is the law of the land in Pakistan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, according to the Information Malaysia 1998\r\n\r\nYearbook, prior to 1988, some cases involving Muslims  could  be\r\n\r\nheard  by  the  secular courts.  In 1988,  Article  121  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution was amended so that the secular courts of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nno  longer  have  any jurisdiction over any matters  within  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction of the Syariah Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Egypt, according to a former Egyptian High Court Chief\r\n\r\nJustice,  there are no separate Syariah Courts  in  Egypt.   All\r\n\r\nSyariah Courts were subsumed under the Civil Courts since  1955.\r\n\r\nThe  Civil  Courts  in Egypt comprise district  governorate  and\r\n\r\nhigher appeal courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, Civil Courts are divided into chambers that deal\r\n\r\nwith  civil,  commercial and personal status matters separately.\r\n\r\nThe  chamber  of personal status administers the  Syariah  laws.\r\n\r\nHence,  all jurisdiction on matters pertaining to the resolution\r\n\r\nof  post-divorce issues falls under the Civil Courts or enforced\r\n\r\nunder  the  civil power.  The Civil laws in Egypt are  based  on\r\n\r\nwritten  laws  issued  in  the late 1920s  and  formulated  from\r\n\r\nIslamic law and Islamic jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India, I was informed that the Syariah Courts do not\r\n\r\nexist.   However,  India  does not have a  uniform  civil  code.\r\n\r\nThere is a statute called \"Sharia Act\".  When Muslims appear  in\r\n\r\na  Civil Court (on divorce matters), the judgement on the  cases\r\n\r\nis  based on Syariah laws through the application of the \"Sharia\r\n\r\nAct\".  They could appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, which\r\n\r\nwill review their cases according to the Syariah laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indonesia, the Religious Court (this is the term used\r\n\r\nfor the Syariah Court in Indonesia) is not the supreme body over\r\n\r\nthe religious and Syariah laws.  Chapter 1, Articles 1 and 2  of\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian Laws No. 7/1989 on Religious Court state that the\r\n\r\nReligious  Court  is  the judicial body for Muslims  in  certain\r\n\r\ncivil cases as determined under Chapter III, Article 49.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas that come under the jurisdiction of the Religious\r\n\r\nCourt   in   Indonesia   are  those  pertaining   to   marriage;\r\n\r\ninheritance,  wills,  and  grants based  on  Islamic  laws;  and\r\n\r\nproperty  donated for religious or community use as  charity  or\r\n\r\nwakaf.   The  Religious Court co-exists with Civil Courts.   The\r\n\r\nCivil Courts enjoy the same position as the Religious Court  and\r\n\r\neach  has  its own judicial authority.  In Indonesia, there  are\r\n\r\nfour  judicial  bodies.  They are Civil Court, Religious  Court,\r\n\r\nMilitary   Court   and   State   Administrative   Court.     The\r\n\r\nadministrative, organisational and financial responsibilities of\r\n\r\neach  of  these  Courts  come  under the  respective  Ministries\r\n\r\nalthough they are established under the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why I dwell at length on the experience of\r\n\r\nMuslims in other countries is none other than to emphasise  that\r\n\r\nthere are many ways of implementing the Syariah laws and, as the\r\n\r\nsaying goes, there are many roads to Rome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that we have to be creative in\r\n\r\ndeploying  selective  elements of Islamic  traditions,  combined\r\n\r\nwith  ideas,  techniques, institutions  and  facilities  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  and  recent  past  to cope with  the  specially  modern\r\n\r\npredicament:  political, social, economic  and  cultural  issues\r\n\r\nthat  emerged as a result of the changes that have affected  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, let me ask this question. Do the amendments\r\n\r\nproposed by the Minister take away or in any manner deprive  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  of  their rightful choice for the avenue  to  seek  for\r\n\r\njustice?  The answer is no.  The amendments give the Muslims the\r\n\r\nright  to  exercise  their free will.  The control  is  entirely\r\n\r\nwithin the Muslim community themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, individual justice can never be fully satisfied\r\n\r\nwithin  the  condition of existence.  We can follow all  Islamic\r\n\r\nrules that, in their ultimate result, should provide us with the\r\n\r\n\"happiness  in  both  worlds\".  Moreover, we  can  follow  other\r\n\r\nnorms:  medical, social, moral, but, because of the entanglement\r\n\r\nof fate or historical accident, we face a situation which places\r\n\r\nus  under persistent \"emergency\" or abnormal condition.  This we\r\n\r\nmust  understand and accept and find solutions to  our  problems\r\n\r\nwithin this context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge facing us is how to combine or reconcile\r\n\r\nIslamic law, Syariah, with the regulation of contemporary public\r\n\r\nand  private  matters.  Given that Islam does not  constitute  a\r\n\r\nmonolithic  entity and not all Islamic countries or  communities\r\n\r\napply  similar solution to their problems, the Bill, to  me,  is\r\n\r\nthe  solution  currently available to us.  It  may  not  be  the\r\n\r\nideal,  but  it  is,  I  believe,  a  workable  one  given   the\r\n\r\nconstraints  facing the Muslims here.  Let us work  together  in\r\n\r\nproviding justice to thousands of Muslim men and women  who  are\r\n\r\nin real need of our urgent attention and, to quote the Minister,\r\n\r\nif  they queue up the length could be from the MCD Building down\r\n\r\nto Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context, Sir, that I am happy to learn and\r\n\r\nfully support the Bill to be committed to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend\r\n\r\nand  support  the Minister's decision to refer  the  Bill  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.  There have been reactions from members of the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community on the amendment to the Administration of\r\n\r\nMuslim Law Act\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n(AMLA).   Committing the Bill to a Select Committee  will  allow\r\n\r\nthese feedback and views to be heard and debated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking to support the Bill, I am mainly concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  proposed  in the Bill  which  will  affect  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court, firstly, by providing it with wider  enforcement\r\n\r\npowers   and,  secondly,  by  conferring  parallel  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nbetween   it  and  the  Civil  Court  on  matters  relating   to\r\n\r\nmatrimonial, maintenance and custodial issues.  I support  fully\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  to  enhance the power and roles  of  the  Islamic\r\n\r\nReligious  Council (MUIS).  But I would like  to  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nissue of parallel jurisdiction as it is widely considered as the\r\n\r\nmost controversial aspect of the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the proposed amendments are laudable in that they\r\n\r\naddress the current shortcomings of the Syariah Court.  Further,\r\n\r\nMuslim women will receive enhanced protection not only with  the\r\n\r\ngreater  power of the Syariah Court President, but also  because\r\n\r\nthey  can  continue to refer matters of division of  matrimonial\r\n\r\nproperties, maintenance and custody to the Civil Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been widely known, the Syariah Court has been\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  a tremendous backlog of cases, of  which  those\r\n\r\npertaining  to matrimonial and custodial issues form  the  bulk.\r\n\r\nIn  the  short term, the granting of concurrent jurisdiction  to\r\n\r\nthe  High Court in these matters will ease the pressures on  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  as well as allow many Muslim couples  to  settle\r\n\r\noutstanding issues arising from divorce proceedings as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it cannot be denied that the amendments go a long\r\n\r\nway  to  clarify the confusion over jurisdiction in  some  cases\r\n\r\nearlier  this year where it was unclear whether they fell  under\r\n\r\nthe purview of the Syariah Court or the High Court.  I refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  Madiah bte Atan v Samsudin bin Budin  in  January\r\n\r\n1998.   The case of Salijah v Abdullah Teo in 1995, as mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Minister and my colleagues, raised concern as to whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community could continue to refer their cases to the\r\n\r\nCivil  Court as they did in the past.  This amendment  to  AMLA,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  merely  restores the choice that  they  had  enjoyed\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the long term, are these amendments sufficient\r\n\r\nin  themselves to correct the problems without jeopardizing  the\r\n\r\nreputation  and  image  of  the  Syariah  Court?   Although  the\r\n\r\namendments  go a long way to solving the backlog  of  cases,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  solve  the  original cause of the  backlog,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nshortage of manpower in the Syariah Court.  It is this shortage,\r\n\r\nif  continued, which will lead to the impression not only in the\r\n\r\nMuslim community, but also in the professional law community  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, that the Syariah Court is inefficient and  lacks  the\r\n\r\nexpertise  and knowledge to enable it to clear the  cases  under\r\n\r\nits jurisdiction in a speedy and systematic manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced power to be given to the President of Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt to transfer documents, for example, in cases of settlement\r\n\r\nof  matrimonial properties and custody, will help to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement  power  of the Syariah Court  and  improve  its\r\n\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some quarters believe that the concurrent jurisdiction\r\n\r\nbetween the Syariah Court and the Civil Court dilutes the  power\r\n\r\nof  the  Syariah  Court.  In reality, however,  even  for  cases\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Civil Court, the rulings are to be consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the  Muslim  law.  This system, however,  can  be  further\r\n\r\nenhanced  by  the  Civil Court concerned  by  appointing  amicus\r\n\r\ncuriae  (Friend  of  the  Court) to  assist  in  clarifying  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  aspects of the Muslim law.  This Friend of  the  Court\r\n\r\nshould  be a Muslim scholar or someone who can advise the  court\r\n\r\non  the Muslim law in order to ensure that the court rulings are\r\n\r\nconsistent with the Muslim law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than that, I think it is timely that, in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the  current  amendments  being  tabled,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  also  look  into  the  issue  of   providing\r\n\r\nadditional  funding to the Syariah Court so that  it  would  not\r\n\r\nappear  that  the Government seeks to permanently undermine  the\r\n\r\nreputation and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimage  of the Syariah Court vis-a-vis the Civil Court.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, to ensure that there is no perception of gender bias,\r\n\r\nthe  Government should look into ensuring that the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nhas  adequate female representation, especially in  relation  to\r\n\r\nFamily Law.  In this, we do not have to \"reinvent the wheel\"  as\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia today, there are approximately 100 female  judges,\r\n\r\nknown  as  \"Ibu Hakim\", who preside over civil but not  criminal\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially pertinent in the light of the amendments\r\n\r\nempowering the Syariah Court to endorse its judgements.  In this\r\n\r\ninstance, the shortage of manpower would clearly be seen  as  an\r\n\r\nimpediment to the greater powers accorded to the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, one further concern which I have over\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  applying to the Syariah Court is  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nclarity on the basis of which the Syariah Court should act  when\r\n\r\nan  application is made by one party to transfer its case to the\r\n\r\nCivil Court.  A reading of the amendments shows that the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  cannot  grant leave to commence civil proceedings  unless\r\n\r\nevery   party  involved  has  been  given  seven  days'  notice.\r\n\r\nHowever,   in   case  one  party  disagrees  to   transfer   the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial, maintenance or custodial matter to the Civil Court,\r\n\r\nwhat  principles will the Syariah Court use in its  decision  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  the  case?  I did not find guidance in  the  Amendment\r\n\r\nBill on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate\r\n\r\nthat  although I commend the amendments as set out in the  Bill,\r\n\r\nin the long term, other measures which I have related above, ie,\r\n\r\nincreasing  the manpower of the Syariah Court, an  investigation\r\n\r\ninto  the  inclusion of female judges for the Syariah Court  and\r\n\r\nfurther  clarification on the principles applied by the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt in deciding on the transfer of cases to the Civil Court in\r\n\r\ncase  one  party disagrees, will serve better towards  improving\r\n\r\nthe efficiency and reputation of the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries,  even where there is a much larger Muslim  population\r\n\r\ncompared  to  Singapore,  it is common to  find  legislation  on\r\n\r\nMuslim affairs which is separate from the State to allow Muslims\r\n\r\nto  apply  for  themselves laws consistent with their  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs.   Many  Muslims around the world live under  conditions\r\n\r\nwhere  Muslim  laws and administration, especially Syariah  laws\r\n\r\nand  Islamic education, are completely separate and independent.\r\n\r\nBut the need for official recognition and support by the secular\r\n\r\nstate  remains strong.  This has led to uneasy divisions  within\r\n\r\nthe  society which could potentially develop into emotional  and\r\n\r\ncomplex  political problems.  On the contrary,  AMLA  which  was\r\n\r\nfirst  enacted in 1968 provides for issues of Muslim affairs  to\r\n\r\ncome  under  State administration with the Majlis to advise  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  Singapore  on  matters  relating  to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligion in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the amendments proposed in this Bill must be\r\n\r\nseen  as a significant step forward for the Muslim community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Despite  the  occasional  calls  for  separate  and\r\n\r\nindependent  Muslim laws and administration,  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  Muslims in Singapore is best preserved  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting arrangement.  These amendments to the Administration of\r\n\r\nMuslim   Law  Act  (AMLA)  to  strengthen  the  two  key  Muslim\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  Singapore  must  be  welcomed.    The   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore  faces many  challenges:  the  need  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  family structures and prevent increasing  occurrence\r\n\r\nof  divorce; the need to ensure that Muslims continue to get the\r\n\r\nbest  of  Muslim and secular education; and the need  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  Muslim civil and community organisations are strengthened.\r\n\r\nThese  can  be  best  served  by strengthening  the  key  Muslim\r\n\r\ninstitutions through AMLA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I wish to support this Bill that\r\n\r\nis  placed before the House.  However, there are several  issues\r\n\r\nwhich have attracted much debate within the community.  Feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the various sectors of the community indicate the need  to\r\n\r\nallow the community to go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  consensus,  through musyawarah.   Therefore,  referring\r\n\r\nthis Bill to a Select Committee is appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is certainly not one for quick decision-making.\r\n\r\nThere are still sections of the community that are fearful  that\r\n\r\ngiving  concurrent jurisdiction to the Civil and Syariah  Courts\r\n\r\nwill  result in a dilution of the Islamic laws in the long  run.\r\n\r\nWith  regard to divorce matters, there is still confusion  about\r\n\r\npotential  conflicts between civil and Islamic laws,  especially\r\n\r\non matters of matrimonial properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compliment the Minister for introducing the\r\n\r\nprovisions which, I think, are forward looking and proactive and\r\n\r\nfor referring this Bill to a Select Committee.  However, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for clarification and consideration  on\r\n\r\na  number  of points.  Firstly, new section 3(2)(f) states  that\r\n\r\nother  functions may be conferred on MUIS by any  other  written\r\n\r\nlaw.   Since AMLA is primarily concerned with creating  MUIS  to\r\n\r\nregulate Muslim affairs in Singapore, it should be restricted to\r\n\r\nthat function and no others.  In my view, it is not intended  to\r\n\r\nbe  an  omnibus  Act to accept roles and functions  outside  its\r\n\r\njurisdiction.  Further expansion of the roles of MUIS should  be\r\n\r\ndebated in the context of this Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 5 gives powers to MUIS to form or participate\r\n\r\nin  any company or through joint ventures.  Is MUIS designed  to\r\n\r\nbe  a business organisation?  This, I think, is a departure from\r\n\r\nthe  original purpose of having an organisation like MUIS.  Even\r\n\r\nso, what are the limits of accountability and responsibility for\r\n\r\nthose handling the commercial interest of MUIS?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 26 is a good amendment for it provides for\r\n\r\nbetter accountability and responsibility of those who have  been\r\n\r\ndelegated powers to act on behalf of MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 35A, I think, is a good amendment as it\r\n\r\nprevents  parties from filing multiple suits.  One question  is:\r\n\r\nwill the parties get the same remedies in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  as  they  will in  the  Civil  Court?   This  is\r\n\r\nproblematic  because  if  the Syariah  Court  refuses  leave  to\r\n\r\ncommence proceedings in the Civil Court and if the ouster clause\r\n\r\nunder section 56A comes into force, then the parties will not be\r\n\r\nable  to  get  the  remedies under civil law at  all.   The  new\r\n\r\nsections  35A  and  35B are useful in that  they  prevent  forum\r\n\r\nshopping,  a  case where litigants shop around  for  the  courts\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give  them the best deal and hence multiplicity  of\r\n\r\nsuits.   It  also  limits the litigants to  remedies  which  are\r\n\r\navailable  under  the  Muslim law  and  the  Syariah  Court  can\r\n\r\neffectively prevent litigants from having recourse  to  a  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome new section 52 to bring amendments closer and in\r\n\r\nline   with   the   Women's   Charter  provided   the   inherent\r\n\r\ninconsistencies and conflicts can be resolved and agreed by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  I welcome extra powers given to the Syariah Court to\r\n\r\nenforce these orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find new section 56A a very curious amendment. The\r\n\r\nexisting section 55(7) already provides that the decision of the\r\n\r\nAppeal Board shall be final.  But it does not make sense to  say\r\n\r\nthat  any  decision  of the Syariah Court  shall  be  final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive  when  there is an appeal to the  Appeal  Board.   As\r\n\r\nsection  55(7) already provides that the decision of the  Appeal\r\n\r\nBoard  shall be final, it is clear that this decision cannot  be\r\n\r\nappealed  against.  The attempt to exclude any form of  judicial\r\n\r\nreview of decisions of the Appeal Board or the court is contrary\r\n\r\nto  established  principles of judicial  review.   What  if  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  the  Appeal Board are reached in  breach  of  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  rules  of justice?  The litigant  will  be  without\r\n\r\nrecourse.  In any case, the use of this ouster clause  has  been\r\n\r\nunsuccessful in ousting the supervisory jurisdiction of the High\r\n\r\nCourt.   A  similar  clause  is  found  in  section  46  of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Act and it was held in the local  case  of\r\n\r\napplication  of  Yee  Yut Ee by Justice Mr  Choor  Singh  to  be\r\n\r\nineffective.   There are of course numerous  other  examples  of\r\n\r\nEnglish law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these specific provisions, there are other major\r\n\r\nissues which come under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of  AMLA and which, in  my  view,  require  the\r\n\r\nsupport and consensus of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Resources of the Syariah Court</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are concerns that the proposed amendments have been\r\n\r\nmade more urgent and necessary in order to avoid the backlog  of\r\n\r\ncases  in  the  Syariah  Court.  Therefore,  the  organisational\r\n\r\nstructure,  resources and manpower needs of  the  Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nmust  be  reviewed in the context of this Bill to ensure  prompt\r\n\r\nhandling of post-divorce cases.  The resources to enforce orders\r\n\r\nof the Syariah Court must be looked into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern whether there will be sufficient\r\n\r\nsuitably  qualified judges in the Syariah Court as it  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to find someone with the necessary qualifications  in\r\n\r\nIslamic  law  amongst the qualified professionals in  the  legal\r\n\r\nfraternity.   Perhaps,  we should look  at  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ntapping the resources of the Judiciary to meet the needs of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court. It is clear that the Syariah Court needs  to  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened  not  only  in its legal  provisions  but  also  in\r\n\r\nmanpower and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial provisions relating to trust, wakaf, nazar and mosque</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of mosques have recently seen vast\r\n\r\nimprovements with mosques providing a whole range of  community-based  services.  The financial provisions specifying  the  need\r\n\r\nfor greater financial accountability and financial reporting  is\r\n\r\nindeed  timely  and appropriate.  Perhaps it is also  timely  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss    professionalism   of   mosque   administration    and\r\n\r\nstreamlining activities and services offered by mosques so as to\r\n\r\navoid  duplication and ensuring high standards of services  that\r\n\r\nthe Muslim community so deserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recognition of Syariah Court</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls for the Syariah Court to be elevated\r\n\r\nto  the  status  of  a court, making it part  of  the  judiciary\r\n\r\ninstead  of the present status of a tribunal under the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Community Development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made good progress through these amendments.\r\n\r\nWe  have  seen  and  heard of the strong desire  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity to participate and contribute in formulating  policies\r\n\r\nfor  AMLA.  We certainly can give this matter more time so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malay/Muslim  community can decide for  themselves  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  conflicting issues which only the community can  decide\r\n\r\nthrough  consensus.  I am sure out of this may emerge a stronger\r\n\r\nsense of agreement and support and commitment that this Bill  so\r\n\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to\r\n\r\nyou for giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shortly after gaining independence in 1965, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced AMLA.  The Bill  was  sent  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.    Representations were made and the  law  came  into\r\n\r\neffect in 1968.  There have been various amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is a major amendment before the House and I am\r\n\r\nindebted to the Minister.  He has listened to the public  views.\r\n\r\nThere has been a report in the Straits Times that AMP and others\r\n\r\nare concerned about certain clauses of the Bill.  I think it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate  that  this  House commits this  Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  where  we  could  hear the  concerns  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  at  the Select Committee, if  need  be,  further\r\n\r\nimprovements could be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the life of a law is not logic but experience. I\r\n\r\nspeak  before this House as a practising lawyer.   Some  of  the\r\n\r\npoints that have been in my mind have already been taken  up  by\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues.   So I shall not duplicate but I  shall  try  to\r\n\r\nreorientate myself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will improve the administration of justice in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As the Minister has pointed out, the Syariah   Court\r\n\r\nis  not  in a position to deliver the goods.  What is the choice\r\n\r\nbefore the country?  Do we wait and let the Syariah Court system\r\n\r\nexist  as it is and let the Muslim friends suffer?  I think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Government have wisely decided to  bring  this\r\n\r\nchange.   And the change, Sir, is not forcing on any Muslim.   A\r\n\r\nchoice of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njurisdiction  is  his or her right and I will shortly  state  to\r\n\r\nthis  House various other matters affecting the personal law  of\r\n\r\nthe Muslims.  The Muslims have the choice in the past.  They are\r\n\r\ngoing to be given the same choice now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Central Provident Fund and the law of\r\n\r\ninheritance.  If a Muslim decides to nominate, so  be  it.   You\r\n\r\nfollow  the  nomination.  But if he wants to follow the  law  of\r\n\r\nIslam, intestate, then Muslim law will follow.  Take the case of\r\n\r\nthe  Maintenance of Parents Act.  A Muslim parent  who  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  maintained  can  go to the Tribunal.   Under  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter,  Muslims  have  gone  to the  Magistrate's  Courts  and\r\n\r\nobtained  maintenance.  The figures have been  released  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, it is the choice of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.   If there is any conflict, of course, the  leave  of\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah  Court has to be obtained.  But where both  parties\r\n\r\nagree and they think that they can get better justice in a Civil\r\n\r\nCourt, why not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question that is of concern to\r\n\r\nsome  Members  of  this House is this.  Can  we  reorganise  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court?  And the Minister has agreed that there is a need\r\n\r\nand I think this should be done.  I wholeheartedly agree with Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  when  he  said  that perhaps  we  could  look  to  the\r\n\r\nresources of the Civil Courts.  Could we have some of the bright\r\n\r\nand  young  Magistrates and District Judges transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court?  They could be trained in Islamic law.  It is not\r\n\r\na  difficult thing.  I think this is something that the Minister\r\n\r\nmay  want to consider.  Nevertheless, some attempts must be made\r\n\r\nto  reorganise  the  Syariah Court.  I think  the  community  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But this is not possible now.  I think the immediate\r\n\r\nproblem,  as  I said earlier, is to get on with the disposal  of\r\n\r\nthe cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one aspect of this Bill which I seek the\r\n\r\nindulgence of the Minister.  I beg to differ.  The Bill,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands,  there is going to be one more President.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nother  alternative  which I would suggest is to  appoint  Deputy\r\n\r\nPresidents.  In the case\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  Strata  Titles Board, we have Mr Tan Lian  Ker  as  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  Then there is a Deputy President, Mr Gan Hiang Chye.\r\n\r\nThere are similar examples.  My fear is this.  If there are  too\r\n\r\nmany  Presidents, there is a question of protocol,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  conflict.  So I think at the proper time,  at  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee perhaps, this matter should be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS, in the last few years, has come of age. And I\r\n\r\nsay this sincerely because I have seen how many wakaf properties\r\n\r\nhave  been  developed for the benefit of the  Muslim  community.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I see the increase in jurisdiction would be welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially glad that trustees are now required to be\r\n\r\nmore prudent and the accounts have to be prepared and audited by\r\n\r\nan  auditor.  I think it is important to have proper checks  and\r\n\r\nbalances and perhaps we could take a leaf from this Bill and  we\r\n\r\nshould even think of amending the Societies Act.  The people who\r\n\r\nhandle public funds must keep proper accounts.  And in the  case\r\n\r\nof  MUIS, it has got wakaf and other trusts as well and I  think\r\n\r\nthe Schedule that has been attached to this Bill is welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is trying to overcome a lacuna as a result of\r\n\r\ntwo  decisions  of  the  Supreme Court which  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nreferred  to.   The  cases  are  Salijah  vs  Abdullah  Teo  and\r\n\r\nLathibaby.   If not for these decisions, I think the need  would\r\n\r\nnot   have  been  that  pressing.   But  because  of  these  two\r\n\r\ndecisions,  I think it is important that the law be  set  right.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the prerogative of this Parliament whenever there  is  a\r\n\r\nlacuna in the law.  We must respond and I think the Minister has\r\n\r\nrightly  responded.  He has been cautious.  He has waited  long.\r\n\r\nHe  has consulted the Muslim bodies.  He has done service to the\r\n\r\nMuslim community, but there is still some doubt.  We will  leave\r\n\r\nthat to the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern that we have is this. What type of Muslim\r\n\r\nsociety  we  are going to build in the context of Singapore?   A\r\n\r\nprogressive Muslim society or a society that is conservative and\r\n\r\nis not prepared to change?  I think it is to the credit of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMuslim  community here, with the setting up of MENDAKI which  is\r\n\r\nanother by-product of MUIS itself, the Muslim community has come\r\n\r\nof  age.   MUIS  has  become part and  parcel  of  the  national\r\n\r\ninstitution.   All  Muslims can be proud of  MUIS.   As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, I had many things to say but because all that I  wanted\r\n\r\nto say have been repeated by many Members, all I can say is that\r\n\r\nI  support the Bill and I am glad that it is going to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  I have some reservations which I have addressed  and\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister would consider them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the proposed amendments in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments seek to rectify some existing\r\n\r\ninadequacies  in  some  areas  of  Syariah  Court   powers   and\r\n\r\nprocedures.   I  commend  the Minister for  being  very  forward\r\n\r\nlooking in bringing forward these amendments expeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to declare my interest that\r\n\r\nI  have represented some clients in Syariah Court matters in the\r\n\r\npast.   I  have also taken the trouble to consult  some  of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  practitioners  who practise in the Syariah  Court  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to inform the Minister that the feedback  has  been\r\n\r\npositive in looking at these amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is a new institution in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen  it was introduced in 1968.  In fact, it is one that should\r\n\r\nbe  considered as a young institution because of its  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  in  existence.   In comparison to  the  Civil  Courts  in\r\n\r\nSingapore which have been in existence since the second  charter\r\n\r\nof justice in 1826, they have a vast and long history.  But even\r\n\r\nwith  such a long history, anomalies and loopholes do  exist  in\r\n\r\nthe  law and even in procedures.  And it is because of that that\r\n\r\nmany  amendments have been made to laws and procedures  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  As such, the amendments, as they come before the courts,\r\n\r\nequally show that loopholes and lacunas can appear in all  forms\r\n\r\nof law, and the AMLA law is no exception.  Sir, in that sense, I\r\n\r\nam glad many of the inadequacies and weaknesses have come up and\r\n\r\nthat this Bill has come to this House for timely reform.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the recent increase in the number of divorces,\r\n\r\nboth  Muslim  and non-Muslim, many divorce couples  are  looking\r\n\r\nforward to quicker remedies and faster procedures.  Some Muslims\r\n\r\nconsider  that  some of the procedures in the Civil  Courts  are\r\n\r\nfaster.   Here,  I must say that  some 10 years ago,  I  noticed\r\n\r\nthat  there  were  delays and a long backlog  of  cases  in  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court.  But I was pleasantly surprised that last  month\r\n\r\nwhen  I  visited  the  Syariah Court, as  part  of  the  Service\r\n\r\nImprovement Unit, drastic changes had taken place in the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.   I  was impressed with the major administrative  changes\r\n\r\nthat  had  taken  place.   They  have  introduced  many  of  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  measures  that  have  been  undertaken  in   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts and in the High Court.   Instances like  case\r\n\r\nmanagement, time schedules, fixed dates for clearing of  backlog\r\n\r\ncases, all these are very impressive changes and I am glad  that\r\n\r\nadministrative changes have been introduced.  I think  it  is  a\r\n\r\nstep  forward in improving the administrative efficiency of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said so, I must impress upon this House that\r\n\r\nmany  of the plaintiffs who resorted to the Civil Court  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  right remedy resorted to it, not because they felt that the\r\n\r\ncivil  law  afforded  a better remedy, but,  unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court did not possess these powers in the first  place,\r\n\r\nand because some of these powers were lacking, they resorted  to\r\n\r\nthe Civil Courts.  But with the introduction of these powers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah Court, I think it will go towards strengthening the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court and hence prevent an exodus, which is the fear  of\r\n\r\nsome in the community towards the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take the House through some of the\r\n\r\nmajor changes in the Bill.  Let me, first, take new section 35A.\r\n\r\nThis  section  covers  two  subjects:  (i)  the  disposition  of\r\n\r\nproperty  on  divorce; and (ii) custody of child.  The  proposed\r\n\r\nscheme  means  that (i) once proceedings are  commenced  in  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court, parties may not commence civil proceedings in any\r\n\r\ncourt relating to the above issues unless there is leave of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court.  And (ii) where such civil proceedings have  been\r\n\r\ncommenced prior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  proceedings in the Syariah Court, then such proceedings  may\r\n\r\nnot  continue unless there is leave of the Syariah Court  or  by\r\n\r\nconsent of the parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the area of custody of child.\r\n\r\nIt has become clear that the High Court has no jurisdiction over\r\n\r\ncustody  matters  under  section 16  of  the  Supreme  Court  of\r\n\r\nJudicature Act where parties are Muslims or married under Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw.  The powers of the Syariah Court to order custody are found\r\n\r\nin section 52 of AMLA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above section, which is a new section, Sir, seeks to\r\n\r\nconfirm  the  decision  in the case of Lathibaby  Bevi  v  Abdul\r\n\r\nMustapha.   In that case, Sir, the High Court ruled  that  where\r\n\r\nthere have been proceedings in the Syariah Court, then only  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  has  jurisdiction over the same.  That  decision\r\n\r\nimplied  that  civil proceedings may be instituted  so  long  as\r\n\r\nthere are no proceedings in the Syariah Court.  Once proceedings\r\n\r\nare  commenced  in  the Syariah Court, then  the  Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nassumes jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other Courts.   The\r\n\r\namendment  seeks  to  tidy this principle by  the  mechanism  of\r\n\r\nissuing commencement and discontinuance certificates before  the\r\n\r\nCourt can assume jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a welcome procedure as:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It is the Syariah Court that holds the key to the\r\n\r\ncommencement or continuance of proceedings in the civil  courts;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The second key is held by the parties themselves. It\r\n\r\nis   the  parties  who  must  consent  to  the  commencement  or\r\n\r\ncontinuance  of  the  action  in the  Civil  Court.   Here,  the\r\n\r\nproposed  introduction of the new section  17A  to  the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Judicature Act requires the High Court in  future  to\r\n\r\nexercise  jurisdiction only with the relevant  certificate  from\r\n\r\nthe Syariah Court or with the consent of both parties before it.\r\n\r\nThe   Civil   Court  cannot,  I  repeat,  automatically   assume\r\n\r\njurisdiction  over  such  matters.   I  believe  there  is  some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding among some members in the Malay  community  who\r\n\r\nassume that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Court will automatically assume jurisdiction once the\r\n\r\nmatter  goes before the Civil Court.  I think this is  something\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps  the Minister could clarify in the course  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee hearings or when subsequently the matter  comes\r\n\r\nup.   Here,  it  is the Syariah Court that determines  how  many\r\n\r\ncases go to the Civil Court.  If the Syariah Court decides to be\r\n\r\nstrict  and tells the parties that appear before it that it  has\r\n\r\nnow  got the full powers to make the decision that a Civil Court\r\n\r\ncan  make,  then I think the number of cases that  will  end  up\r\n\r\ngoing to the Civil Court will be limited.  I think there are not\r\n\r\nmany  cases that both parties consent to go to the civil courts.\r\n\r\nSo  the  fear of some members in the community that the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  will be very liberal in issuing the certificate  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  go  to the Civil Court, I think at this juncture,  is\r\n\r\nsomething which is premature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key, which is being held by the two parties to\r\n\r\nthe  action,  is  that only when both of them  consent  can  the\r\n\r\nmatter  go  before the Civil Court.  So the Civil  Court  cannot\r\n\r\nexercise  jurisdiction  in  the absence  of  consent  from  both\r\n\r\nparties.   In any event, if one party is unhappy that the  other\r\n\r\nparty  has resorted to the Civil Court, they can always go  back\r\n\r\nto  the  Syariah  Court and inform the Syariah  Court  that  the\r\n\r\ncertificate should not be issued and that the matter  should  be\r\n\r\nheard by the  Syariah Court.  At the end of the day, the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  determines whether the matter should go before the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt or not in the absence of consent from both parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the other area where section 35 makes a major\r\n\r\nchange  is  that while the Syariah Court has jurisdiction  under\r\n\r\nsection  35(2) of AMLA to order the disposition or  division  of\r\n\r\nproperty,  problems  have surfaced in the past  in  post-divorce\r\n\r\napplications which have forced parties to seek remedies from the\r\n\r\nHigh Court.  It was, I repeat, the absence of appropriate remedy\r\n\r\nin  AMLA which has forced parties to resort to the Civil  Court.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the courts, like the Court of Appeal in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nSalijah bte Abdul Latif v Irwan bin Abdulah Teo, have ruled that\r\n\r\nit  does  not have jurisdiction to hear the issue of disposition\r\n\r\nor division of property where it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvolves  Muslim  parties.  The proposed  amendment  once  again\r\n\r\nseeks  to  create a new door to the Civil Court in the  area  of\r\n\r\ndisposition or division of property provided the conditions laid\r\n\r\ndown are complied with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area which I note from the discussion in\r\n\r\nthis House which has raised concern among some Members, and this\r\n\r\nis in the area of concurrent jurisdiction.  Effectively, the new\r\n\r\nsection  35A  creates  concurrent jurisdiction in giving  powers\r\n\r\nboth  to the Syariah Court and the civil courts in the two areas\r\n\r\nI  have highlighted, ie,  disposition of property and custody of\r\n\r\nchild.   Naturally,  there are arguments  for  and  against  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  such  concurrent jurisdiction.  Having  acted  for\r\n\r\nparties  in the past in Syariah Court matters, I must  say  that\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans  are fortunate that  they  have  two  legal\r\n\r\nforums  to  seek remedies instead of one which many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare at present entitled to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition, at the end of the day, what matters is:\r\n\r\nare  the  parties  who  are going to the court  happy  with  the\r\n\r\ndecision?  Are they happy that they have received justice?   Has\r\n\r\nany  one  of  these  parties  who have  gone  before  the  court\r\n\r\ncomplained  to  the Civil Court that because they  were  Muslims\r\n\r\nthey  have  been unfairly treated, that they have been  unjustly\r\n\r\ntreated, that the law has been applied unjustly?   Here, I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that I have not heard any Muslim party who has gone to  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Courts complaining that the law has been unjustly applied\r\n\r\nto  them.  I would highlight an instance later on where  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  many of the principles which are found in the Civil Courts\r\n\r\nand under Muslim law are similar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of maintenance, the present section 35(2)\r\n\r\nprovides that the Syariah Court has jurisdiction to hear matters\r\n\r\nrelating  to  maintenance.  Section 3(1) and (2) of the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter  also  entitles  Muslim  parties  to  bring  maintenance\r\n\r\nmatters  to the Civil Courts.  Civil Courts have been  accepting\r\n\r\napplications for maintenance by Muslim women for their or  their\r\n\r\nchildren's maintenance.  Some resort to the Civil Courts because\r\n\r\nof expediency and also the enforcement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npowers  available to the Civil Courts.  Here again, Sir, in  the\r\n\r\npast,  many resorted to the Civil Courts because there was delay\r\n\r\nin  the  way  maintenance proceedings were going in the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.   But  I  must once again reiterate that  what  came  out\r\n\r\nduring my visit last month was that measures are being taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Syariah  Court to speed up the collection  of  maintenance.\r\n\r\nThey  have  now  introduced a computerised  system  of  tracking\r\n\r\nmaintenance payments.  As such, the ability of the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nto move in the area of collection of maintenance arrears will be\r\n\r\nimproved.  I think the number of Muslim couples who will  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Courts to claim maintenance may see a decline in  the\r\n\r\nlong run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 35B confirms the present scheme of\r\n\r\narrangement  within the Civil Court and the  Syariah  Court  and\r\n\r\nmakes  it  clear  that  once  civil proceedings  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  proceedings are commenced, the Syariah Court  shall\r\n\r\nstay  the proceedings before it involving the same matter.  Here\r\n\r\nagain,  there  are  once again arguments  for  and  against  the\r\n\r\nexercise of this concurrent jurisdiction by two different  Court\r\n\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay Muslim community in Singapore has been happy with\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement in the past because they know that it benefits\r\n\r\nthe  community.  The two proposals that have now come  about  in\r\n\r\nsection  35  which  involve  custody  and  the  disposition   of\r\n\r\nproperty.   Once  they see the full implementation  of  the  two\r\n\r\nprovisions,  they  will  realise that it actually  benefits  the\r\n\r\ncommunity because it leads to the expeditious disposal of cases,\r\n\r\nwhether by the Syariah Court, or in the event of consent by both\r\n\r\nparties, by the Civil Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I would like to highlight is the new\r\n\r\nsection  51(4).  This is a new power which was missing in  AMLA.\r\n\r\nThis  is  definitely a welcome proposal as all courts must  have\r\n\r\npowers  to  vary  or  rescind  their  orders,  particularly   in\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  matters when circumstances change  along  the  way.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grounds for varying or rescinding the orders appear\r\n\r\nin  the  amendments  to  be limited to only  three  grounds.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the three grounds that are stated in the section are  very\r\n\r\nrestrictive and perhaps a wider term could have been  chosen  to\r\n\r\nprovide for greater exercise of discretion by the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\nThe same comment would apply to the new section 52(7).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of the new section 51(5), I feel that\r\n\r\nproviding for a prison sentence in the case where one  party  is\r\n\r\nin contempt of court is a little drastic.  Perhaps the option of\r\n\r\na  fine  or a prison sentence may be appropriate to suit varying\r\n\r\ndegrees of contempt of court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to move on to the new section 52(3).\r\n\r\nHere  again, this is also a welcome provision.  There have  been\r\n\r\ncases in the past where parties got their divorces effected by a\r\n\r\nKadi  under section 102.  In many of these cases, Sir, ancillary\r\n\r\nissues  such  as  custody and disposition of property  were  not\r\n\r\naddressed  and  recorded  as part of the  divorce  terms.   When\r\n\r\nparties could not settle these issues, they could not go back to\r\n\r\nthe  Kadi  as  after  the  divorce he becomes  functus  officio.\r\n\r\nNeither   could the parties refer these matters to  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt because the present section 52 suggests that the powers of\r\n\r\nthe Syariah Court are restricted to making orders in respect  of\r\n\r\nproceedings in the Syariah Court and do not include divorces  by\r\n\r\na  Kadi.   This  was confirmed in the decision of the  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal in a recent case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment specifically gives the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nthe  powers  to  make orders in respect of divorces  by  a  Kadi\r\n\r\nunder  section 102, whether such divorces are registered  before\r\n\r\nor   after  the  commencement  of  these  amendments.   It  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  be a relief to many who have been caught  without  a\r\n\r\nvenue to sort out their ancillary matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 52(6) is something that I would say is\r\n\r\na  marvellous provision.  This section seeks to incorporate  the\r\n\r\nprinciples that are found in section 112 of the Women's Charter.\r\n\r\nSection  112  of the Women's Charter lays down the factors  that\r\n\r\nthe Civil Courts will take into account\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  looking  into the disposition of matrimonial property.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is  a proviso that the Syariah Court in applying  section\r\n\r\n112  will ensure that it is consistent with Muslim law.  The aim\r\n\r\nappears to be to give clear guidelines to the Court and  to  the\r\n\r\nparties  as to their rights over their matrimonial property.   I\r\n\r\nam informed by many of my colleagues who practise in the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt that many of the principles that are found in section  112\r\n\r\nof  the  Women's Charter have already been applied by the Appeal\r\n\r\nBoard  in  many  of  its decisions in so far  as  they  are  not\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with the Muslim law, although the  Board  did  not\r\n\r\nrefer specifically to section 112 in its decision.  This is  the\r\n\r\nsection  that  I  would  like  to  highlight.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Women's  Charter or in other areas  where,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  the  principles  that are  taken  by  the  court  into\r\n\r\naccount, whether it is the Syariah Court or the Civil Court, may\r\n\r\nactually overlap, and at the end of the day, the object  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise is to ensure that parties in their post-divorce matters\r\n\r\nare  treated fairly and that justice is accessible  to  both  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also learnt from some Muslim practitioners that the\r\n\r\nproviso  that  the law be not inconsistent with  Muslim  law  is\r\n\r\nimportant  as there are differences between Muslim law  and  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter in this respect.  For instance, the non-payment\r\n\r\nof  iddah  and mutaah has been held to affect the share  in  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  flat  (there is an Appeal  Board  Case  No.  14/95)\r\n\r\nwhereas these are matters which are irrelevant under the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 53A is also something that should be\r\n\r\nwelcomed.  Here, it gives the President of the Syariah Court the\r\n\r\npower to execute documents where a party who is ordered to do so\r\n\r\nis  absent, neglects or refuses to do so.  This will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe situation that arose in Salijah's case does not arise again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the amendments, one would notice that it is\r\n\r\npossible  for a party to go through three courts in the process.\r\n\r\nFor the issue of divorce, iddah and mutaah, they may have to  go\r\n\r\nto the Syariah Court.  On the issue of custody and matrimonial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassets, they may go to the Family Court.  On the enforcement  of\r\n\r\ncertain  orders, they may have to go to the District Court.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, if one looks at the location of these three courts,\r\n\r\none  is  in  MCD Building in Thomsom Road, the Family  Court  is\r\n\r\nlocated  at  Patterson Road and the High Court is  located  just\r\n\r\nwithin  walking  distance of this House, what this  means  to  a\r\n\r\nlayman  is  that to obtain different remedies he has  to  go  to\r\n\r\nthree  different venues.  I would urge the Minister that in  the\r\n\r\nlong term process of locating the Syariah Court, to explore  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  locating the  Syariah Court within  the  Family\r\n\r\nCourt complex so that it is very convenient for lay persons  who\r\n\r\naccess the courts to go to one location where they can have  all\r\n\r\ntheir remedies in one place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me just say that there has been concern\r\n\r\nexpressed  that the new amendments may mean a big shift  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber of ancillary matters pertaining to Muslims being heard by\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Court.   I do not think so.  The Syariah  Court  has\r\n\r\nbecome  dynamic and efficient.  It has become proactive and  has\r\n\r\nadopted  some  new strategies to resolving matrimonial  disputes\r\n\r\nsuch  as mediation, counselling and other new technologies.   It\r\n\r\nhas   also   gone  into  computerised  tracking  of  maintenance\r\n\r\npayments.   I think the Syariah Court can rise to the  challenge\r\n\r\nand meet the needs of its customers and not fear a big shift  of\r\n\r\ncases  to  the  Civil Courts.  The prospect  of  this  happening\r\n\r\nshould become lesser, as I have reiterated earlier, Sir, as many\r\n\r\nMuslim  parties have resorted to the Civil Courts  in  the  past\r\n\r\nbecause of the lack of appropriate remedy in the Syariah  Court.\r\n\r\nBut  this should change with the new amendments.  In any  event,\r\n\r\nproceedings  in the Syariah Court are attractive  also  as  they\r\n\r\ncost  much less than those in the Civil Courts.  With  new  case\r\n\r\nmanagement,  time schedule, backlogs of cases and delays  should\r\n\r\nbe a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure that the Muslim community in Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be eager  to give its input before the new Bill is passed\r\n\r\nas law.  It is a Bill that will affect the Muslim community.   I\r\n\r\nam  quite sure that there will be some areas where the Bill  can\r\n\r\nbe improved.  For that reason,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI applaud the decision of the Hon. Minister to refer the Bill to\r\n\r\na  Select  Committee  so  that  all  viewpoints  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  could be heard and a considered decision  taken.   In\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  I  would particularly like to urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nobtain  representation from the members of the legal  profession\r\n\r\nwho  specialise in Syariah Court matters and also  Muslim  women\r\n\r\ngroups, because I believe Muslim women form a large majority  of\r\n\r\nthose who have resorted to Civil Courts in the past.  So I think\r\n\r\ntheir feedback will be useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nSir,  for  this opportunity.  Being the last speaker, I  hope  I\r\n\r\nstill get your attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had thought that this amendment would be a welcome\r\n\r\ninstrument  for  the  administration of justice  in  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.  In soliciting feedback from grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nand  Muslim  friends that I know of, I observe three conflicting\r\n\r\nviewpoints:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there are Muslim men and women who welcome the\r\n\r\namendment  and feel that the concurrent or parallel jurisdiction\r\n\r\nin  both the Syariah and Civil Courts offers another option  and\r\n\r\navenue for grievance articulation and dispute settlement.   Some\r\n\r\nMuslim  women  feel  that  Civil Court  intervention  under  the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter compensates them more and protects their  rights\r\n\r\nequally   like  the  non-Muslim  sisters.   On  the   procedural\r\n\r\nchallenges,  the Syariah Court has been criticised  for  lacking\r\n\r\nthe  sophisticated procedural mechanisms that the Supreme  Court\r\n\r\nhas  for proper administration of justice.  Petitioners have  to\r\n\r\nwait  far too long to settle their disputes in the Syariah Court\r\n\r\ndue  to  low  manpower  and resources.  By  having  Civil  Court\r\n\r\nintervention,  Muslim  petitioners  hope  to  see   faster   and\r\n\r\neffective response to their disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the application of civil law to Muslim\r\n\r\nmatters  is  controversial.  I hear from other  Muslim  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  that  this  amendment changes the substantive  rights  of\r\n\r\nMuslims, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexample,  in the way matrimonial assets were defined differently\r\n\r\nunder the Syariah Court and Women's Charter.  This Bill seeks to\r\n\r\ndeal with the administrative problems faced by the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nby  giving  the  Supreme Court concurrent  jurisdiction  in  the\r\n\r\nresolution  of  matters which are ancillary to divorce  such  as\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  custody  of children and division  of  matrimonial\r\n\r\nassets.   The  problem is that the law applied  by  the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  in  hearing  cases which have been transferred  from  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  will be the civil law, ie, the Women's  Charter.\r\n\r\nWhat  if  there is a conflict between the Supreme Court and  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court?  Matrimonial assets under the Syariah  Court  do\r\n\r\nnot  include possessions before marriage, but under the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter, they do.  Concurrent jurisdiction therefore may dilute,\r\n\r\nas  argued  by Association of Muslim Professionals in  a  public\r\n\r\nstatement  a  few  days  ago, the status and  authority  of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court in enforcing the substantive rights of the parties\r\n\r\nunder Muslim law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of this view assert that the Syariah Court is\r\n\r\nthe  supreme  adjudicative body which must  be  strengthened  by\r\n\r\nadding  more resources and personnel to its operation to  assist\r\n\r\nit  to be effective in clearing its case overload and delivering\r\n\r\nadequate service to the community.  For them, there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor  concurrent  jurisdiction  as  this  may  only  confuse  the\r\n\r\npetitioners  as  well as legal practitioners who  now  have  two\r\n\r\ndifferent forums to choose from which best suit the interests of\r\n\r\ntheir clients.  Any change of tack by petitioners from using one\r\n\r\nforum  to  another will create even more litigation hurdles  and\r\n\r\nadministrative  ambiguity.  And when children are  involved  and\r\n\r\nhave  to be dragged into different courts to testify, the  scene\r\n\r\ncan be messy and emotionally trying.  Mr Ravindran has portrayed\r\n\r\na  very different picture in his legal experiences.  Again, this\r\n\r\nneeds further clarification and verification. I am glad to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  Mr  Ravindran also that it is not easy to switch from  one\r\n\r\ncourt to another.  But this has to be communicated and clarified\r\n\r\nwith the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderate opponents to this amendment are willing to accept\r\n\r\nthe amendment for the sake of meeting current case pressures  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  the concurrent jurisdiction is only an interim measure\r\n\r\nand  the  Syariah  Court  will over  time  be  strengthened  and\r\n\r\nrecognised   as   the  final  authority  in   adjudicating   the\r\n\r\nsubstantive   rights   and   procedural   mechanism    in    the\r\n\r\nadministration  of Muslim affairs.  Conscious  development  must\r\n\r\nthen   follow  to  give  the  Syariah  Court  certain  essential\r\n\r\nprocedural mechanisms as well as enforcement powers to carry out\r\n\r\nproper administration of justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third conflicting view, which I observed is the most\r\n\r\nthorny  one, deals with the process of consultation between  the\r\n\r\nState  and the Muslim community.  Some sections of the community\r\n\r\ngroups  feel  that  the amendment was proposed without  adequate\r\n\r\nconsultation.  Policymakers did not carry the ground  by  giving\r\n\r\nmore  time  and attention to reviewing the issues with community\r\n\r\nleaders   and   helping  them  to  get  a  fuller  and   clearer\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the rationale of the amendment.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the Ministry has also failed to get appropriate  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom the community to help improve the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it was felt that given what is arguably the most\r\n\r\nradical change to the AMLA ever since its promulgation in  1968,\r\n\r\nthe  process from conceptualisation to decision fixing  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  significant  time  to enable the  Muslim  community  more\r\n\r\nopportunity  to reflect and offer feedback on the  matter.   The\r\n\r\nprocess  was too rushed, top-down and did not include a  broader\r\n\r\nbase of viewpoints and recommendations for desired change.   For\r\n\r\nsome,   this   amendment  at  best  represents  only   selective\r\n\r\nviewpoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Ministry of Community Development and the\r\n\r\nMinister  must have consulted various grassroots Muslim agencies\r\n\r\non  what  \"best legal practices\" to adopt to act in the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  community.   There might have been  different  starting\r\n\r\npoints  and  ending  points  in the  consultation  process  with\r\n\r\ndiverse  groups.   Leading  community  agencies  may  not   have\r\n\r\nexplained the issues as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat  was  clear  was  that the process failed  to  capture  the\r\n\r\ncontentious  sentiments on this matter.   What  is  certain,  it\r\n\r\nseems to me, is that the Muslim community does not yet agree  if\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction is a good strategy to serve the interest\r\n\r\nof  the petitioners.  Even less certain is how they would  agree\r\n\r\non  a broader problem on who defines what changes for whom,  for\r\n\r\nwhat  purposes and how?  There are apparent different  responses\r\n\r\nto this broad concern arising from fundamental differences based\r\n\r\non gender, nature of interpretation of the Islam faith, sectoral\r\n\r\nand professional interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a non-Muslim, I cannot pretend to understand the full\r\n\r\nimplication of the AMLA on the followers of Islam. I am far from\r\n\r\nunderstanding  the disputes relating to divorces  known  in  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  law, as I learn, fasakh, cerai taklik, khuluk and talak.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  therefore at this juncture take a stand on a  secular\r\n\r\nplatform  to make hasty judgement on matters which are evidently\r\n\r\ndelicate   and   sensitive.   Neither  can  I  point   out   the\r\n\r\ninsufficiencies of the proposed provisions in the  amendment  or\r\n\r\ntackle  the fine-tuning of some of the clauses which some Muslim\r\n\r\nlegal practitioners have raised and submitted a proposal to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry for review.  I suspect on this matter, after hearing so\r\n\r\nmany  different opinions from the hon. Members,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nvery different opinions from the professional and lay community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel that as a Singaporean in a multi-cultural\r\n\r\nsociety, I must discharge my responsibility in being part of  an\r\n\r\n\"active  citizenry\"  by  exercising some  degree  of  empathetic\r\n\r\nreasoning on matters of tremendous importance to my compatriots.\r\n\r\nEven  if  I cannot pass a last judgement, I could contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  process of debate by simply surfacing, as I am  doing  now,\r\n\r\nthe  conflicting concerns of a particular community which I have\r\n\r\nhad  the  opportunity  to learn about.  In the  final  analysis,\r\n\r\nshort  of  a  higher  level  order which  allows  the  State  to\r\n\r\narticulate and enforce clear principles of adjudication over and\r\n\r\nabove ethnic and religious specificities, I feel that the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity has to decide what and how they propose to manage  the\r\n\r\nmounting challenges faced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby the Syariah Court and the role of the State is to facilitate,\r\n\r\nand  negotiate for, some degree of consensus in the  conflicting\r\n\r\nviewpoints within the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this view, I strongly support the call for this\r\n\r\namendment   to  be  put  to  a  Select  Committee  for   further\r\n\r\ndeliberations and closer scrutiny.  I would recommend, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  get more feedback from as many Muslim  groups  as\r\n\r\npossible,  as  well  as from members of the public  through  the\r\n\r\nmedia and written representations.  It would be helpful to  tell\r\n\r\nthe  public the rationale and background factors as to why  this\r\n\r\namendment  was raised and what outcome was intended.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis gesture of openness will sit well in the community, in view\r\n\r\nof  our  current  discourse on developing  a  people  sector,  a\r\n\r\nbrilliant  concept recently used by Minister Teo Chee  Hean,  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  space and process time are provided for citizens  to\r\n\r\nwork  out  their cohesion and the sense of relevance.   Let  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community and its multifarious groups carry out a reality\r\n\r\ncheck  among themselves and if they cannot reach consensus,  and\r\n\r\nthe  State  has to be the final arbiter, they at least  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  say  they  agree  to  disagree  in  defining  a\r\n\r\nsignificant piece of legislation.  We must give time,  Sir,  and\r\n\r\nrespect for such effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have left out\r\n\r\na  point  just  now.  I urge the Minister to write  to  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety  to  ask  for its representation.   I  believe  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety has formed a committee in this regard and perhaps he may\r\n\r\nwant to consider writing to them for representation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Rai may wish to know that, in\r\n\r\nfact,  the Muslim Law Committee of the Law Society has submitted\r\n\r\na report to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been a very long day. Since the Bill will go\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee, I do not intend to go through in detail\r\n\r\nthe  replies.  Suffice it to say that I would address  the  main\r\n\r\npoints which Members have brought up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to thank Members for speaking and the\r\n\r\nstrong  support  given  by   my colleagues.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nspecially thank Mr Ravindran for the clarification which he gave\r\n\r\nfrom  the  practitioner's viewpoint, especially the point  about\r\n\r\nSyariah Court having made improvements which, unfortunately, not\r\n\r\nmany people know about.  But, anyway, we will persevere, and  we\r\n\r\nwill continue to improve the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope Members will bear with me, as I said, if I do\r\n\r\nnot  reply to all the questions in the interest of time.  But  I\r\n\r\njust  like  to  highlight the concerns which the  community  has\r\n\r\nbrought up.  Of all the amendments, the main concern, which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  up  by the Muslim community,  is  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction.  Some of the concerns are the result of\r\n\r\na  lack  of understanding of the full provisions.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nconcerns  are genuine in the sense that they feel that  they  do\r\n\r\nnot fulfil the aspirations of the community.  If I could somehow\r\n\r\ncategorise these concerns, I would put them thus:  First,  there\r\n\r\nwere  concerns that the Civil Courts could reach decisions which\r\n\r\nwould  contradict  Muslim  law.  As I  said  earlier,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nconcurrent  jurisdiction has, de facto, been happening  all  the\r\n\r\ntime.   In fact, Muslims have been going to the Civil Court  and\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court all this time.  So far, there has  not  been  any\r\n\r\ncomplaint about the injustice or the decision of the Civil Court\r\n\r\nbeing  against  them.  I understand, Sir,  that  in  matters  of\r\n\r\ncustody  especially - and this matter of custody is one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost sensitive areas which the Muslims have brought up - when it\r\n\r\nrelates  to  the  children's religion, the moral  and  religious\r\n\r\nupbringing of the child is a factor which is considered  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt  also.  In any case, the interest and welfare of the child\r\n\r\nare foremost, which is the same also in the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is that concurrent jurisdiction may\r\n\r\nerode  or dilute the stature and image of the Syariah Court.   I\r\n\r\ndisagree, Sir, because given the additional powers which we  are\r\n\r\ngiving  to  the Syariah Court now, indeed, it will increase  the\r\n\r\nstature and power of the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  would like to supplement this with what I said just now  that\r\n\r\nwe  will continue to develop the Syariah Court and look into how\r\n\r\nand in what areas the Syariah Court could be improved so that it\r\n\r\ncan  be an institution which the community can be confident  and\r\n\r\nproud of and which can fulfil the aspirations of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, there is the fear that there would be an\r\n\r\nexodus of Muslim couples, instead of going to the Syariah Court,\r\n\r\nnow   going  to  the  Civil  Court  because  of  the  concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction.   I, again, disagree, Sir.  I think  it  has  been\r\n\r\npointed  out  by Mr Ravindran just now that, in all  likelihood,\r\n\r\nthere  would be a decrease of Muslim couples going to the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt because they are more aware now, especially with all  this\r\n\r\npublic  debate  about  the Syariah Court and  the  Civil  Court.\r\n\r\nBecause  of this awareness, I think there is a higher likelihood\r\n\r\nof  Muslims now looking towards the Syariah Court than the Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.   Anyway, my Ministry and the Syariah Court are going  to\r\n\r\nmonitor whether this exodus does, indeed, take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth concern is that they hope that the concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction, if it is unavoidable, ought to be temporary.  As I\r\n\r\nsaid, we will monitor the developments both in the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nand the Civil Court.  We hope to develop the Syariah Court to  a\r\n\r\nlevel whereby it can be the kind of institution which the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  hopes  for  and  where  the  Muslim  community   will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  depend  on.   While I cannot  say  how  long  this\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction will carry on, I would suggest  that  we\r\n\r\nleave  the concurrent jurisdiction as it is first.  We carry  on\r\n\r\nand,  in  the meantime, we will continue to develop the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.  Because, ultimately, Sir, it is not whether or not there\r\n\r\nis  concurrent jurisdiction, but how the Syariah Court is  being\r\n\r\nperceived by the community as fulfilling their aspirations.  How\r\n\r\ndo  we  instil confidence and pride in the Syariah  Court?   The\r\n\r\nonly  way  to  do  it  is to assure that the  Syariah  Court  is\r\n\r\neffective,  it is prompt in deciding its cases and  it  has  the\r\n\r\nrequisite expertise, manpower and facilities to do the job well.\r\n\r\nThis, as I said, we will continue to pay attention to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Sir, it is a question of choice. What we are\r\n\r\ngiving here is that the Muslim community would have a choice  of\r\n\r\neither  going  to the Syariah Court or the Civil  Court.   Being\r\n\r\naware  of their rights and what the courts can do, I think  they\r\n\r\nare  in a better position to make their choice now.  I feel that\r\n\r\nwe should not take away this choice from the Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community should adopt the attitude which Mr Ravindran\r\n\r\nproposes just now, ie, to see how the amendments are implemented\r\n\r\nand  to  give it a chance to be implemented.  For all you  know,\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of  the amendments will  satisfy  what  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community is hoping for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various specific questions asked by Members. I\r\n\r\nam not going to reply to all and, my officers have taken note of\r\n\r\nall  the suggestions.  But I would like to address what Mr Harun\r\n\r\nGhani  mentioned just now.  I am afraid I cannot recite a pantun\r\n\r\nas  he  did,  because in the translation of the pantun,  it  may\r\n\r\nappear  differently.  But he did say that we  need  not  specify\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction and, by doing so, the whole problem will\r\n\r\nbe   solved   because  de  facto  we  already  have   concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction.   I am afraid that cannot be done  because,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the Lathibaby's case, the Civil Court has made it very\r\n\r\nclear that whatever is in the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court,\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be touched by the Civil Court.  So we have  to  make\r\n\r\nthis provision in the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address one particular point brought\r\n\r\nup  by  Mdm Claire Chiang who argued that we are in fact solving\r\n\r\nadministrative problems through concurrent jurisdiction.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  wholly  true because, as I said, we are merely  reinstating\r\n\r\nwhat has been happening all this time.  I said just now too that\r\n\r\nwe  ought  to adhere to the principle of not denying  Muslims  a\r\n\r\nchoice  of  which forum they want to go to.   So  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of merely trying to solve administrative problems  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we resort to concurrent jurisdiction with  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on Mr Hawazi's speech. He made two\r\n\r\ninteresting points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne is the appointment of amicus curiae (Friend of Court).  This\r\n\r\nis  a measure which we could think about and see whether it  can\r\n\r\nbe  applicable.   The other point is the appointment  of  female\r\n\r\nMuslim judges in the Syariah Court.  I am not too sure what  the\r\n\r\nimplications are in terms of Syariah law.  But, again,  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething perhaps we could look into carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various small points which I would not touch on,\r\n\r\nas  I said, in the interest of time.  But I would like to assure\r\n\r\nMembers   that  whether  or  not  the  amendments   fulfil   the\r\n\r\naspirations of the community, I think, it has to be  seen.   The\r\n\r\nMalay  MPs  and myself have looked carefully into the amendments\r\n\r\nand  we  feel  that  the amendments will help  significantly  in\r\n\r\nimproving the justice system in Singapore, not only for  Muslims\r\n\r\nbut also as a legal system that exists in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would commend Members to tell those who are\r\n\r\ninterested in coming up with suggestions or those who feel  that\r\n\r\nthey want to make representations to the Select Committee, to do\r\n\r\nso.   The  Select Committee will be more than pleased to receive\r\n\r\nthe representations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee consisting\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Speaker  as Chairman and such Members the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSelection may nominate. - [Mr Abdullah Tarmugi].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERPRETATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a  Third\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on the Interpretation (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  received nine written submissions.  After considering  the\r\n\r\nsubmissions, the Committee decided that it was not necessary  to\r\n\r\nhear  oral representation as almost all the submissions were  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill, and none had specifically opposed it.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee's Report has been presented to Members of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee deliberated on the key points raised in the\r\n\r\nsubmissions and agreed that they are already catered for in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   These  include safeguards to ensure  that  before  brain\r\n\r\ndeath  is  certified,  having  two  doctors  to  determine  that\r\n\r\nirreversible  cessation  of  all  brain  functions  has   indeed\r\n\r\noccurred,  the inclusion of an independent medical  practitioner\r\n\r\nto  certify  brain  death and that the statutory  definition  of\r\n\r\ndeath  be  kept separate and distinct from provisions  governing\r\n\r\norgan transplant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee has, after deliberating on the\r\n\r\nissues raised in the submissions, recommended that there  be  no\r\n\r\namendment to the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this opportunity now to reiterate five\r\n\r\nimportant points concerning the Interpretation (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  objective  of  the  Bill  is  to  provide  a  legal\r\n\r\ndefinition of death for all purposes and formalise what  is  the\r\n\r\ncurrently accepted medical practice.  The traditional concept of\r\n\r\ndeath,  referred to by doctors as \"cardiac death\",  occurs  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  permanent cessation of the circulation of  blood  and\r\n\r\nrespiration in the body of a person.  This concept, however, can\r\n\r\nno  longer  be  applied  in every case because  of  advances  in\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment and technology, in particular,  resuscitative\r\n\r\nand  life  support  technology.  The law must allow  doctors  to\r\n\r\ncertify  death  when  a  person's brain has  ceased  functioning\r\n\r\ntotally  and irreversibly, even though his heart is kept beating\r\n\r\nor  can  be kept beating through artificial means for a  limited\r\n\r\nperiod of time. This is because such a person is in effect  dead\r\n\r\nand  there  is  no possibility at all that he will  ever  become\r\n\r\nalive again.  The legal definition of death proposed in the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  allow  doctors to use either the cardiac  or  brain  death\r\n\r\ncriteria  to determine when death occurs.  The doctor determines\r\n\r\nwhich  set of criteria should be used according to the  clinical\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the determination of brain death will be in\r\n\r\naccordance with clinical criteria that will be prescribed in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulations under the new section 2A of the Act. These  criteria\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  same as those currently prescribed in  the  Human\r\n\r\nOrgan  Transplant  Act (HOTA) Regulations for determining  brain\r\n\r\ndeath  in the case of HOTA donors.  The brain death criteria  in\r\n\r\nHOTA  are  a  refinement of the criteria that  were  unanimously\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the  Medical Royal Colleges and  Faculties  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1976.\r\n\r\n.    Third, HOTA was implemented in January 1988. The definition\r\n\r\nof  brain  death  and the criteria for determining  brain  death\r\n\r\nunder HOTA have therefore been tried and tested for the last  10\r\n\r\nyears and have gained public acceptance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is a need in certain circumstances to define\r\n\r\nprecisely the time of death.  For example, the family of a brain\r\n\r\ndead  person  who  is being maintained on a  ventilator  can  be\r\n\r\nspared unnecessary mental anguish and financial burden if  brain\r\n\r\ndeath  can be promptly determined and certified.  Also,  if  the\r\n\r\ndeceased or his family had consented to organ donation, accurate\r\n\r\nand  timely  determination of death is  necessary  so  that  his\r\n\r\norgans  would  still  be viable when harvested.   Any  delay  in\r\n\r\ncertifying  death  may  result  in  the  donated  organs   being\r\n\r\nunsuitable for transplantation to save the lives of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, there are additional provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\ngoverning the certification of death in situations where  organs\r\n\r\nwill  be lawfully removed for transplant purposes.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  family  of  the deceased  and  the  community  that\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards are in place to prevent untimely removal  of\r\n\r\nthe donor's organs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION (CHANGI EAST)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The  balance area will be used for roads  and  planting\r\n\r\nstrips by LTA and NParks respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed reclamation should be carried out to meet\r\n\r\nany  projected shortfall of industrial land after the year 2000.\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Trade  and Industry projects that  even  with  the\r\n\r\nreclamation  at Tuas and Jurong Island for industrial  use,  the\r\n\r\nshort   and   medium  term  industrial  land  supply   will   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient.

We  all suffered from the haze pollution.  It  was  more\r\n\r\nthan  an  inconvenience.  The elderly and those  among  us  with\r\n\r\nrespiratory  problems  were particularly  affected.   Our  young\r\n\r\nchildren  were especially vulnerable.  One of the world's  worst\r\n\r\necological  disasters;  that is how  the  Chief  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Environment Programme described the fires and  haze  in\r\n\r\nour  region.  Yet, some have short memories.  In preparing  this\r\n\r\nmotion, some ask why I should seek to move this motion now.  Our\r\n\r\nskies are quite clear, and the latest meteorological predictions\r\n\r\nare  that  rain  in the region is likely to keep haze  pollution\r\n\r\nlevels  lower  than  they were last year.  Moreover,  some  have\r\n\r\nasked  me to feel that the economic crisis of the region  should\r\n\r\ntake precedence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is true that the rains have put down most of the\r\n\r\nfires  for the moment.  I also recognise the great and turbulent\r\n\r\ntimes  Singapore and the region face, especially our neighbours.\r\n\r\nYet, I also believe that it is more important and timely for  us\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  the  issue of fires in the region  and  the  haze\r\n\r\npollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do this because the fires and haze are a recurrent\r\n\r\nproblem.   In  the  1990s alone, heavy haze was  experienced  in\r\n\r\n1991, 1994, 1997 and this year.  Each time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcern and anger arose.  Then the sentiment evaporated when the\r\n\r\nskies  cleared,  and in our inaction, the fires  and  haze  have\r\n\r\nhappened  again.  So we must not be inactive this time when  the\r\n\r\nskies  are  clear.  We should act before the  haze  is  upon  us\r\n\r\nagain.   It  may  be good politics to talk about this  when  the\r\n\r\nskies  are  grey outside, but it will be too late to  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  We should discuss the issue and set out what  we  need\r\n\r\nto  do  now,  so that we will not have to suffer the  same  fate\r\n\r\nagain  next year or in future years.  If we postpone our actions\r\n\r\nagain,  it  will  be  too late.  We must act  preventively.   We\r\n\r\nshould act when the skies are clear, to make sure they stay that\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, I recognise the economic crisis in the region is\r\n\r\nserious.   In fact, it is the background of the fires and  haze,\r\n\r\nwhich originate largely from Indonesia, our neighbour.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  understand that the environmental problem is  tied  up  with\r\n\r\neconomics.  It is the unscrupulous big businesses and  companies\r\n\r\nwho  are  behind  the fires, not the natural El Nino  phenomenon\r\n\r\nalone.   Experts agree that the dry weather makes things  worse.\r\n\r\nBut  the origin and underlying causes of the fires are man made.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  because we are learning that El Nino  is  a  cyclical\r\n\r\nevent, we must be prepared for the next time it comes.  And even\r\n\r\nthe  experts  do  not know exactly when that will  be.   Weather\r\n\r\nforecasts have been wrong before.  We cannot therefore depend on\r\n\r\nthe vagaries of rain to save us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is both a threat and an opportunity for\r\n\r\nthe  haze and fires.  The crisis may lead to a worsening of  the\r\n\r\nfires  and haze.  There are three threats.  The first threat  is\r\n\r\nthat   Indonesia   will   lack  administrative   and   financial\r\n\r\nwherewithal to deal with the fires.  The second threat  is  that\r\n\r\nIndonesia  will  give  low priority to the fires.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  remember that the former Environment Minister of Indonesia\r\n\r\nplaced the issue no higher than fifth in his list of priorities.\r\n\r\nThe  third  threat  is that the economic necessity  to  increase\r\n\r\nexports and gain foreign currency for Indonesia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to  more  unscrupulous,  unsustainable  and  illegal\r\n\r\nlogging and clearing of plantations by fires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis and political transition in our region and\r\n\r\nIndonesia   also   create   a  window   of   opportunity.    The\r\n\r\nopportunities  are two-fold.  First, that in  the  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical  reform, policies with negative environmental  impacts\r\n\r\nmay be corrected.  For example, the previous IMF package set out\r\n\r\na  number  of conditions, including reform on the allocation  of\r\n\r\nforest  concessions.  If transparency is brought to the  system,\r\n\r\nmore responsible land users can be preferred over those who  use\r\n\r\nfire  to  clear land.  The second opportunity is that among  the\r\n\r\nreformers in Indonesia today, there are those who have cared and\r\n\r\nstill  care  for the environment.  There may therefore  be  more\r\n\r\npeople  in  Indonesia itself who will work with us in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand others to safeguard the environment of our region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the recovery for Indonesia and the\r\n\r\nregion should aim to be on the basis of sustainable development,\r\n\r\nrather  than  one  that needlessly destroys nature  and  natural\r\n\r\nresources, and harms our environment and human health.  We  must\r\n\r\nprioritize  actions against fires and haze.   Let  me  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  not just an environmental issue  about  forests,\r\n\r\nabout  nature, about animals.   The human and health  costs  are\r\n\r\nhigh.  Moreover, the fires and haze are also economic phenomena.\r\n\r\nAn  international  study has estimated that US$4.4  billion  was\r\n\r\nlost  by  Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in  the  1997  fires\r\n\r\nalone.   This  is a considerable amount of money, especially  in\r\n\r\nthese bad economic times.  This sum, moreover, does not consider\r\n\r\npossible longer-term health effects.  It also estimates the loss\r\n\r\nof  tourist arrivals for just one year, 1997.  If the haze is  a\r\n\r\nrecurrent  problem  and our region has a  bad  reputation  among\r\n\r\ntourists, we do not know how much more our economy may  lose  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge our Government to consider how it can do\r\n\r\nmore to deal with the fires and haze.  In calling for them to do\r\n\r\nmore,  I  acknowledge  the work that the governments  of  ASEAN,\r\n\r\nincluding Singapore's, have done to date.  Credit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould go to ASEAN governments that they have continued to  meet\r\n\r\nto discuss the Haze Action Plan and other responses to the fires\r\n\r\ndespite  the  economic crisis.  There has  been  some  progress,\r\n\r\nwhich I leave to the Minister for the Environment to explain.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that many Singaporeans still do not know fully what  our\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing to protect and care for them on this  issue.\r\n\r\nI believe too that more can be done by Singapore, in addition to\r\n\r\nwhat  has been done already.  There are, of course, many  things\r\n\r\nthat Indonesia can and should do for itself.  After all, the use\r\n\r\nof  fires is illegal under Indonesia's own laws and the bulk  of\r\n\r\ndamage is suffered by her own people and environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these suggestions, I draw from a policy dialogue\r\n\r\nwhich  was  organised  in  early June  1998,  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Council  on  which I serve  as  a  director.   This\r\n\r\ndialogue brought together some 40 non-governmental organisations\r\n\r\n(NGOs), think-tanks and experts.  Many of these NGOs are working\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia  and have experience on the ground  there.   There\r\n\r\nwere  also  representatives from the private sector,  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank,  ASEAN Secretariat  and  the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Programme.  I chaired the dialogue which  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement    with   some   30   suggestions   for   governments,\r\n\r\ninternational  donors  and  the  private  sector.   I  wish   to\r\n\r\nhighlight just a few suggestions here today and add some  of  my\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I speak in the Singapore Parliament, I shall focus more\r\n\r\ntoday  on  what I hope Singapore and our Government may  do.   I\r\n\r\nshall divide my suggestions between, first, Singapore as part of\r\n\r\nASEAN;   second,  bilateral  measures  between   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nIndonesia; and, third, self-help, ie, what Singapore can do  for\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, ASEAN. I urge that the Singapore Government work\r\n\r\nwith  ASEAN members to extend and strengthen the existing Action\r\n\r\nPlans.   These  Action Plans rely too much on  goodwill  without\r\n\r\nbinding  obligations,  and I urge our Government  to  work  with\r\n\r\npartners  towards  a  binding  treaty,  which  must  accept  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of state responsibility that Indonesia or other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries  which cause the fires are responsible for  them,  and\r\n\r\nthen  to  create  a  system for dispute resolution  among  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I call on ASEAN to recognise that Indonesia has\r\n\r\nacted  contrary  to International Law and Principle  21  of  the\r\n\r\nStockholm  Declaration.  Indonesia is causing great  damage  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  our  region  but  also to global  climate  change  and\r\n\r\nbiodiversity,   and  these  are  subject  to  two  international\r\n\r\ntreaties   to   which  Indonesia  and  Singapore  are   members.\r\n\r\nSingapore and ASEAN should therefore work to focus international\r\n\r\nattention and assistance on the problem.  And this proposal,  in\r\n\r\nsome  senses,  is  like  our response to  the  economic  crisis.\r\n\r\nSingapore can serve by being a focal point on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion on how Singapore should work with\r\n\r\nASEAN  is  a negative one.  I believe our Government  and  ASEAN\r\n\r\nshould  not over-emphasise water bombing, throwing water on  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   Sir, the experts we have consulted have advised  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  of  great  expense  and of little  effect,  especially\r\n\r\nwithout  sufficient  fire-fighting on  the  ground.   Given  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis, I have no doubt that the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nmay   come  under  pressure,  alongside  Brunei,  to  fund  such\r\n\r\nspectacular but really quite unproductive efforts.  I  urge  our\r\n\r\nGovernment not to take this step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral measures between Indonesia and Singapore, my\r\n\r\nsuggestions are four.  First, we have refrained from emphasising\r\n\r\nstate  responsibility  of  Indonesia  and  their  liability  for\r\n\r\ndamages suffered by our people and economy.  We have shown  good\r\n\r\nneighbourliness and understanding of their circumstances.   This\r\n\r\nis good.  But our friends in Indonesia must recognise that there\r\n\r\nare  limits.   This is especially because the fires are  caused,\r\n\r\nnot  by  the poor in Indonesia, not by the Government,   but  by\r\n\r\nlarge  companies.  The poor in the affected areas  of  Indonesia\r\n\r\nsuffer  even  more than Singaporeans.  We must ask Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nrecognise its responsibility and to fulfil its duty to cooperate\r\n\r\nto prevent a recurrence of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfires.    Indonesia   must  recognise  its  responsibility   for\r\n\r\ntransboundary pollution that affects us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second plea on the bilateral relations is that Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  not  necessarily conduct itself only  on  the  level  of\r\n\r\ncountry  to country, government to government. Sir, I urge  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government consider means to make these disputes  at  their\r\n\r\nnatural  level,  ie,  largely  between  citizens  and  corporate\r\n\r\noffenders.   Our  Government can, with Indonesia's  consent  and\r\n\r\ncooperation,  set up a special court between the  countries  or,\r\n\r\nalternatively,  to  allow special access  to  courts  in  either\r\n\r\ncountry.  Examples of such courts exist in the Nordic Convention\r\n\r\namong  the Nordic countries in Europe and in the North  American\r\n\r\nFree Trade Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on bilateral issues, Singapore has promised\r\n\r\nbillions of dollars in loans to Indonesia for their economy  and\r\n\r\nfor trade guarantees, in particular.  Sir, I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  consider  that any further assistance to Indonesia  must  be\r\n\r\ntied   first  to  their  environmental  performance.    We   are\r\n\r\nIndonesia's friends.  I think in giving those first loans,  that\r\n\r\nis  clear.  But the Indonesian government must do its utmost  to\r\n\r\nhelp  its  own  people and environment, and the  people  of  the\r\n\r\nregion, including Singaporeans.  Indonesia should implement  its\r\n\r\nown laws against the use of fire. It should investigate and name\r\n\r\noffending  companies and enforce those laws against the  use  of\r\n\r\nfire,  against  all companies equally and effectively.   Foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  may be among those offending shareholders,  including\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    There  have  been  statements   by   Indonesian\r\n\r\nministries to that effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not urge that our Government should protect\r\n\r\nSingaporean investors abroad if they are truly offenders.  But I\r\n\r\ndo urge our Government to ensure that Indonesia's prosecution of\r\n\r\nsuch  corporate  offenders should be equal and  that  Indonesian\r\n\r\noffenders  should  also  be  prosecuted  on  par  with   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, I call on the Singapore Government to engage\r\n\r\nthe Indonesian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngovernment  more  broadly,  not  just  the  Minister   for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  but  also  the Indonesian Ministries  of  Forestry,\r\n\r\nAgriculture,  Trade  and  Industry  and  Finance.    And   these\r\n\r\nengagements should be at the highest level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many experts, and I believe the Minister too, have\r\n\r\nrecognised,  there  is  a  lack of  coordination  in  Indonesian\r\n\r\nauthorities  on  this issue.    The power  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEnvironment  in  Indonesia to control  forest  and  agricultural\r\n\r\nlands is not at all clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my suggestions on how Singapore can help\r\n\r\nitself, ie, self-help.  The first proposal I hope the Government\r\n\r\nwill  consider  is  to promote and facilitate eco-labels.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not jargon.   Basically, it is a certification process\r\n\r\nby   which   we  can  discover  which  products  have   a   good\r\n\r\nenvironmental background and which are manufactured or  produced\r\n\r\nin  an  environmentally harmful way, in ways that use  fire  and\r\n\r\nresult in haze.  Certification processes are already used by our\r\n\r\nGovernment   for  a  range  of  products.   I  urge   that   the\r\n\r\ncertification of products be applied to those connected with the\r\n\r\nfires  and  haze, which are timber and oil palm.   Certification\r\n\r\nwould  allow  Singaporean consumers and  those  environmentally-minded  consumers  in Europe and America and elsewhere  to  vote\r\n\r\nwith  their  dollar  signs, to punish  the  corporate  offenders\r\n\r\ndirectly in the market place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second measure for self-help I propose is that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  an advisory to all Singaporean companies  investing,\r\n\r\nlending  or  trading  with Indonesian companies.   The  advisory\r\n\r\nshould   spell  out  at  least  their  obligations  to   observe\r\n\r\nIndonesian laws against the use of fire to clear land.  If we do\r\n\r\nnot  do this, Sir, we are polluting ourselves.  If we do not  do\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir,  it  will  also  be  a  political  embarrassment  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, if our companies pollute overseas and flout laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third self-help measure, I hope the Minister and the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  consider,  is  to  assist  in   investigating\r\n\r\nSingaporean   companies,   if  requested   by   the   Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we face a large problem, such as the fires and\r\n\r\nhaze,  some among us may shrug our shoulders and say, \"We are  a\r\n\r\nvery  small  country, what can we do?\"  It is true.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nchange our geography.  But I urge against this counsel of apathy\r\n\r\nand  fatalism.  That is not the response of Singapore when faced\r\n\r\nwith  so  many crises such as the regional economic crisis.   In\r\n\r\nthat case, we have been among the countries that have sought  to\r\n\r\nfocus  international attention and assistance, and we have  done\r\n\r\nour share, some say more than our share, with the loans, to help\r\n\r\nour  neighbour.   This  same  positive,  proactive  and  helpful\r\n\r\nresponse should be used for the fires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also some who say that Singapore can indeed do\r\n\r\nmore.   But their version of what we should do is to give  money\r\n\r\nand  keep  quiet.  I do not share this view.  I do not recommend\r\n\r\nthat  we throw money at the problem.  Nor do I say that we  must\r\n\r\ninterfere  in  our  neighbour's internal politics.   I  want  to\r\n\r\nstress  that  this,  as I see it, is not  a  case  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nagainst  Indonesia, or Indonesia against Singapore.   There  are\r\n\r\nthose  in Indonesia who genuinely wish to solve the problems  of\r\n\r\nthe fires and haze and to enforce their own laws.  After all, as\r\n\r\nI  have said, the Indonesians are the ones who suffer the  most,\r\n\r\nnot  us.   If such people have the will and the skill, but  lack\r\n\r\nequipment,  know-how and funding, Singapore should assist  them.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the right thing to do and it is in our national interest\r\n\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are others in Indonesia who wilfully set the fires or\r\n\r\nwho  close  one  eye to those who set the fires.   These  people\r\n\r\nprofit  from  flouting the laws and causing  damage  to  others.\r\n\r\nThese  people are no friends of mine, nor should they be friends\r\n\r\nof  anyone in Singapore, I hope.  It is not help or funding that\r\n\r\nwe should give such people.  We have to find legal sanctions and\r\n\r\ntrade  and other measures that can press such people to  do  the\r\n\r\nright thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying as such, Sir, is that we need a mix of\r\n\r\nhelp  and  sanctions, of carrots and sticks.  We  need  to  help\r\n\r\nthose  who  genuinely want and need our help, and  pressure  and\r\n\r\nimpose sanctions on the bad guys.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion is that the Singapore Government should do\r\n\r\nmore.  I have given some specific suggestions, but these are not\r\n\r\npart  of the motion itself.  The precise measures can and should\r\n\r\nbe   left  to  the  Minister  for  the  Environment.   The  more\r\n\r\nfundamental question, I urge upon the House, is whether we  have\r\n\r\ndone  enough  today,  whether  our  people  perceive  that   our\r\n\r\nGovernment has done all it can and all it should.  If not,  then\r\n\r\nwe should do more.  And all those who wish the Government should\r\n\r\ndo more, including the Government itself if it plans to do more,\r\n\r\nshould support this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should do this and not sit passive. We\r\n\r\nshould  do  this because this is a transboundary  issue,  not  a\r\n\r\ndomestic  matter,  but  a  matter of common  concern,  of  great\r\n\r\nrelevance  to  all  of  us.   We  should  do  this  because  the\r\n\r\ninternational law is on our side, and against the fire starters.\r\n\r\nWe  should do this as part of our contribution to help save  the\r\n\r\nglobal environment from further climate change gases and loss of\r\n\r\nbiodiversity.  We should do this because our economy needs  more\r\n\r\nstimulus and growth, not further strain and grey skies from  the\r\n\r\nhaze.   We should do this because Singapore is our home, and  in\r\n\r\nour  home,  we, especially our elderly parents and grandparents,\r\n\r\nour young children and grandchildren, should be kept safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin support of the motion in the name of Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, Singapore was blanketed with an unusual\r\n\r\nhaze  phenomenon on a scale never before experienced  here.   It\r\n\r\nimmediately  brought to our attention that what  was  previously\r\n\r\nthought  of  as an unrelated seasonal problem, miles  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, can bring about serious consequences to our lives and\r\n\r\neconomic  activities.  The forest fires in  Indonesia  certainly\r\n\r\nmade  life in Singapore difficult, from respiratory ailments  to\r\n\r\nother   health   problems,  falling  tourist   arrivals,   which\r\n\r\nconsequently affected businesses in the hotel and retail  sector\r\n\r\nat a time when these businesses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  heavily  dependent  on tourism.  It frustrated  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore as a region, as an equatorial paradise.   Now\r\n\r\nblanketed  by  smoke and haze, Southeast Asia quickly  became  a\r\n\r\ndestination to be avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze problem brought home the point that Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  ignore issues like forest fires raging in a neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry.   These  problems  have wide, geographic  and  economic\r\n\r\nramifications.  These  problems respect  no  boundary.   Despite\r\n\r\nthese problems, Singaporeans have reacted to the situation  with\r\n\r\nits  usual  calm and matured manner, aware of the  sensitivities\r\n\r\nand  appreciate  the good relationship with its neighbours.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  were  calls for more assistance  to  be  given  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to help poor farmers cope with the situation.   After\r\n\r\nall,  you cannot blame anyone for the changing weather condition\r\n\r\nthat is wreaking havoc across many countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it later became apparent that forest fires are not\r\n\r\nmerely  the  result of bad weather or poor methods  of  shifting\r\n\r\ncultivation, but the involvement of major business conglomerates\r\n\r\nengaged  in pre-meditated burning with total disregard  for  the\r\n\r\nenvironment,  simply for commercial gains.  Quietly,  and  quite\r\n\r\nquickly,  Singaporeans were upset and fed up with the situation.\r\n\r\nWhile they may see the need and urgency to help in terms of both\r\n\r\nexpertise  and equipment and financial resources,  others  doubt\r\n\r\nthe  efficacy  and the effectiveness of such efforts  without  a\r\n\r\nclear demonstration on the part of these businesses to stop  the\r\n\r\npractice  of burning as a convenient but irresponsible means  of\r\n\r\nclearing  land.  Now that the skies have become clearer,  albeit\r\n\r\ntemporarily, another type of storm is raging throughout Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic and political reforms now taking place in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  environmental issues may appear less  pressing.   On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, with the onset of the dry season, renewed  threat\r\n\r\nof  fire  and haze is ever present.  The haze that has blanketed\r\n\r\nus since the middle of last year may not be visible now.  But it\r\n\r\nis by no means a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclosed  chapter.  Therefore, as good friends and neighbours,  we\r\n\r\nmust  help  Indonesia, not only in its efforts towards  economic\r\n\r\nand political reforms, but in environmental reforms, and putting\r\n\r\nin place measures to prevent future fires from taking place.  By\r\n\r\ncoordinating resources through the national haze action plan and\r\n\r\nchanging  the  mindset  about the environment,  that  while  the\r\n\r\nforest   may   be   geographically  a  national   interest   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility, the environment is for all mankind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a country that is heavily dependent on external\r\n\r\nassistance to stabilise and reform its economy, as it  does  not\r\n\r\nhave  the resources to tackle a huge environmental problem  with\r\n\r\nthe  same urgency, as we think it deserves, therefore, it is  in\r\n\r\nour own interest that this matter is given the attention that is\r\n\r\nneeded.  I am glad for the active role that Singapore is playing\r\n\r\nthrough the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to do more in terms of providing the\r\n\r\nequipment  and financial resources from ourselves and persuading\r\n\r\nother donor countries to help.  But amidst scarce resources  and\r\n\r\ncompeting  needs brought about by the economic crisis,  we  must\r\n\r\nensure  that  resources  and assistance  will  bring  about  the\r\n\r\ndesired  outcomes in terms of preventing forest  fires  and  the\r\n\r\nrenewed  commitment towards a more responsible attitude  towards\r\n\r\nthe  environment.  Clearly assistance must be tied to firm plans\r\n\r\nand commitment.  After all, for this assistance to be effective,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  really needed are national plans for public  education\r\n\r\neffort and strict enforcement against open burning, mobilisation\r\n\r\nof  ground  fire fighting forces and transmission of information\r\n\r\non  fire outbreaks, matters which only the Indonesian Government\r\n\r\ncan  and must do, for no amount of international effort will  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  if  the  will and commitment are lacking  at  places\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are most needed - at the grassroots levels,  within\r\n\r\nthe business, the farmers, the villagers and local officials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Singaporeans must continue to be aware\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  too critical, for it is easy for us to  talk  about\r\n\r\nforest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfires, because we do not have any forest to talk about.  But  it\r\n\r\nis  precisely  because  of  this that  Singapore  should  remain\r\n\r\ninvolved  and  active, and demonstrate our willingness  to  help\r\n\r\nsolve this problem.  We should do more to help our neighbours to\r\n\r\nbe  better  equipped  and prepared to tackle  the  environmental\r\n\r\nproblem.   Never  before has it been clearly  demonstrated  that\r\n\r\neven  for environmental issues, unless we take a firm and active\r\n\r\naction, the clean air, water and equatorial forests for which we\r\n\r\nare  so  dependent upon and for which we have taken for  granted\r\n\r\nfor so long may be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, let me\r\n\r\nsay  to  the  two NMPs that I do understand their concerns  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, I fully share their concerns about the haze situation in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and the potential for the haze to return to Singapore\r\n\r\nagain when the dry season starts in the coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as pointed out by Mr Simon Tay, we have actually been\r\n\r\ndoing  quite a fair bit.  Before I reply to his specific points,\r\n\r\nit  would  be good for me to explain the approach the Government\r\n\r\nhas taken so far, what we have done, and what we intend to do in\r\n\r\nthe coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me assure Members that Singapore, together with\r\n\r\nour  ASEAN members, are continuing to pay close attention to the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  fires and haze, even though the skies are  now  very\r\n\r\nclear.   We  fully realise that a repeat of the 1997  fires  and\r\n\r\nhaze disaster will certainly aggravate the region's already  bad\r\n\r\neconomic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN countries also appreciate the economic problems\r\n\r\nfacing  Indonesia.   We  recognise that we  must  actively  help\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to  prevent  fires and haze.  The  regional  economic\r\n\r\nturmoil also means that such help must come not just from  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers, but also from the larger international community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I share Mr Simon Tay's and Mr Zulkifli's\r\n\r\nviews  that  international assistance must be  directed  towards\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  can  indeed be effective  in  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem, both in the short, medium and long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, when fires were raging in Kalimantan, the\r\n\r\npriority then was to internationally mobilise equipment to fight\r\n\r\nthose  huge raging fires.   Fortunately, rains have returned  to\r\n\r\nthe region, and have helped to put out the large-scale fires  in\r\n\r\nmost  parts  of Indonesia.  Our focus has consequently  changed.\r\n\r\nWhat is most pressing now is to help Indonesia in its effort  to\r\n\r\nprevent  fires,  to detect fires early, and to put  in  place  a\r\n\r\nsystem to put fires out as soon as they are detected.  The focus\r\n\r\nof  regional  and international assistance should  therefore  be\r\n\r\nshifted  from  efforts to put out huge raging fires  to  funding\r\n\r\nground-level activities aimed at putting out fires when they are\r\n\r\nstill small and manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last haze episode, Singapore has, in fact, taken\r\n\r\na lead role in forging a regional response to the fires and haze\r\n\r\nproblem.  We hosted the very first ASEAN Ministerial Meeting  on\r\n\r\nHaze  (AMMH)  in  December  last year and  initiated  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Haze Action Plan (RHAP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regional Haze Action Plan has provided a broad\r\n\r\nframework  for  the  region  to tackle  the  haze  problem.   It\r\n\r\nencompasses  short-, medium- and long-term  solutions.   Through\r\n\r\nthe  Action  Plan,  ASEAN countries have since  concluded  their\r\n\r\nrespective  national  haze  action plans,  identified  resources\r\n\r\navailable  and the additional resources needed to  fight  fires,\r\n\r\nand  set  out  various  mechanisms  for  greater  intra-regional\r\n\r\ncooperation on fires and haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key development under the Regional Action Plan was the\r\n\r\nagreement  to  quickly implement two sub-Regional  Fire-fighting\r\n\r\nArrangements   -  one  to  prevent  fires  from  developing   in\r\n\r\nKalimantan and the other in Sumatra.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sub-Regional Fire-fighting Arrangements (RFAs) deal\r\n\r\nwith  ground  level  cooperation needed to detect,  monitor  and\r\n\r\nfight  fires.   They  involve the sharing  and  mobilisation  of\r\n\r\nresources within a sub-region to pre-empt and fight fires.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to ensure that fire outbreaks are detected  early\r\n\r\nand  put out quickly before they can expand to a disaster level.\r\n\r\nMalaysia is the lead country in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSumatra  RFA,  with  Indonesia and Singapore as  members,  while\r\n\r\nBrunei  is  leading  the  Kalimantan  RFA,  with  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia as the other two members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze held in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  19th June, the ASEAN Environment  Ministers  felt\r\n\r\nthat  aerial water bombing is not only extremely expensive,  but\r\n\r\nmay not be that effective in heavily forested areas.  So in this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  think  Mr  Simon  Tay  is  correct.   This  is  our\r\n\r\nconclusion  too.   The Ministers agreed that Sumatra  RFA  would\r\n\r\ninvolve two key activities.  The first is an aerial surveillance\r\n\r\nregime  to  detect fires.  Why do we need this?  We  have  found\r\n\r\nthat  the existing satellite monitoring system that we  have  in\r\n\r\nplace  now  can only detect fairly sizeable fires.  Very  often,\r\n\r\nthese  fires  are  already too large to be easily  put  out.   A\r\n\r\nmonitoring  regime  using aircraft will help  to  overcome  this\r\n\r\nlimitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial surveillance, however, is also a very costly\r\n\r\noperation.  Fortunately, Indonesia plans to use her own hardware\r\n\r\nresources, thereby significantly reducing the cost.  But because\r\n\r\nof economic problems, Indonesia will need help in funding out-of-pocket  expenses, especially fuel costs.  During the Ministerial\r\n\r\nmeeting, both UNEP and the USA, fortunately, had indicated their\r\n\r\ninterest  in participating in the aerial operations  and  we  do\r\n\r\nlook forward to their funding support for these operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second activity under the Sumatra RFA is to improve the\r\n\r\ncommunications  network among agencies  at  the  provincial  and\r\n\r\ndistrict  levels in Sumatra.  The objective is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ninformation on fires can be quickly disseminated to  the  ground\r\n\r\nfire-fighting forces.   This is an area where Singapore has  the\r\n\r\nexpertise.   We  will be providing Indonesia with  communication\r\n\r\nand  computer  equipment to support the aerial surveillance  and\r\n\r\nfire  fighting  operations.   The key  is  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ninformation picked up by the aerial spotters can be very quickly\r\n\r\nfed down to the ground forces because every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhour  that  is  lost will result in the fire only  getting  much\r\n\r\nlarger.  We will focus our assistance on four priority provinces\r\n\r\nin  Sumatra, namely, Riau, Lampung, Southern Sumatra and  Jambi.\r\n\r\nThese  are the four provinces with significant fire-prone forest\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the RFAs effective, Indonesia will need help in\r\n\r\nother  areas  too.  These would include fire-fighting  equipment\r\n\r\nand the training for their firemen.  These are areas where other\r\n\r\ncountries have the necessary expertise.  Malaysia has offered to\r\n\r\nprovide  training  on  fire fighting and  ASEAN  countries  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  seek  international assistance  through  UNEP  and\r\n\r\nbilaterally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to UNEP and international assistance, UNEP has\r\n\r\nparticipated in most of the ASEAN haze meetings and  is  playing\r\n\r\nan  important  role in mobilising international assistance.   It\r\n\r\nhas  formulated a US$10 million short-term plan to contain fires\r\n\r\nin  Kalimantan, and this plan was drawn up when there were about\r\n\r\n1,000 fires raging in Kalimantan.  However, as recent rains have\r\n\r\nhelped to put out the Kalimantan fires, the donor countries have\r\n\r\nquite understandably not been very forthcoming in responding  to\r\n\r\nUNEP's  appeal.   At  the  recent  Ministerial  meeting,  UNEP's\r\n\r\nrepresentative  agreed that it would now try to  get  the  donor\r\n\r\ncountries  to  contribute towards preventive  measures  instead.\r\n\r\nASEAN will continue to maintain close contact and work with UNEP\r\n\r\non this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about our role? Singapore will continue to provide\r\n\r\nassistance  to  Indonesia  on  the  forest  fire  problem,  both\r\n\r\nbilaterally and as part of regional and international efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we provided about $300,000 to install an\r\n\r\nIntranet  system  that enables ASEAN countries to  expeditiously\r\n\r\nshare satellite information on fires and haze.  We also provided\r\n\r\nthe  Jakarta Command Post, which monitors fires and  haze,  with\r\n\r\nvarious  hi-tech  communication  equipment  and  computers,  and\r\n\r\ntrained its staff on their use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, at Indonesia's request, we intend to provide\r\n\r\nfurther assistance under the RFAs.  These would include computer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  communication equipment to support aerial surveillance  and\r\n\r\nfire-fighting operations, as I have mentioned just now.  We will\r\n\r\nalso  train key ground staff from these provinces on the use  of\r\n\r\nthese and other equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key element which the Ministers have identified is\r\n\r\npublic  education.   Public education must go hand-in-hand  with\r\n\r\nother  efforts to deal with the haze.  Indeed, public  education\r\n\r\nis  an important aspect addressed under the Regional Haze Action\r\n\r\nPlan  and  the  Ministers have agreed that public education  and\r\n\r\nincentives  against open burning should be widely  conducted  at\r\n\r\nthe  local levels.  These measures have, in fact, been  included\r\n\r\nunder  the  respective National Haze Action Plans, and  we  will\r\n\r\nhave to develop them into the implementation stage subsequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement, ASEAN Ministers have also urged Indonesia\r\n\r\nto  step  up its enforcement against illegal burning activities.\r\n\r\nWe noted that the Association of Indonesian Forest Entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nwas  prosecuted in court recently, and fined 50 billion  rupiah.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  through effective enforcement, coupled with  heavy\r\n\r\npenalties  that  reflect  the true cost  of  the  fires  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  and  regional economies, and to the  health  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,   that  Indonesia  can  deter  plantation  owners   from\r\n\r\ncontinuing their highly irresponsible activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our recent meeting, the Ministers also agreed that ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  should  include  presumptive  provisions   in   their\r\n\r\nnational laws to make it easier to successfully prosecute owners\r\n\r\nof  burnt land.  This arose from the explanation that it is very\r\n\r\ndifficult to catch people who are setting fires to the land red-handed,  and  therefore the burden of proof is a very  difficult\r\n\r\none  to  fulfil.  At that discussion, both Brunei  and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshared with us their experience and they told us that they  have\r\n\r\nsuch  presumptive  provisions  in  their  laws  and  that  these\r\n\r\npresumptive  provisions  turn  out  to  be  very  effective   in\r\n\r\ndeterring illegal open burning activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers also urged countries which are converting\r\n\r\nlarge tracts of forest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  peat lands into plantations to carefully review their land-use policies so as to discourage open burning practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay has also mentioned some other points. I will take\r\n\r\nthem  up separately.  He has asked that Singapore work with  the\r\n\r\nother  ASEAN countries to strengthen the action plans.   We  are\r\n\r\ndoing that.  In fact, the Sub-Regional Fire-fighting Arrangement\r\n\r\nis  a  result of the Regional Haze Action Plan that was  put  in\r\n\r\nplace.   As  we continue with the discussions, we were  able  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  some of those information sharing plans  into  actual\r\n\r\naction  plans  on  the ground. So the RFA was one  of  the  very\r\n\r\nimportant outcomes of the Regional Haze Action Plan and we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  strengthen  those action  plans  and  ensure  that\r\n\r\nresources can be found to implement them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked several times about the need to have\r\n\r\nbinding  treaties.   Sir,  treaties result  only  when  all  the\r\n\r\nparties  involved are prepared to even consider the  possibility\r\n\r\nof  such  treaties.  I do not think we have come to  that  stage\r\n\r\nyet.   In  fact, we are very, very far from that stage where  we\r\n\r\ncan  even talk about the possibility of treaties.  Let us  focus\r\n\r\non  things which are productive, things which do not divide  the\r\n\r\nwhole meeting and make the meeting acrimonious.  Let us work  on\r\n\r\nthings  that  all  parties can agree with  and  where  effective\r\n\r\noutcomes can be found.  Therefore, I do not think his suggestion\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore coming out with binding treaties with Indonesia\r\n\r\nor,  in fact, with the other ASEAN countries is something  which\r\n\r\nis viable at this present stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that the ASEAN countries and Singapore ask\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to  recognise its responsibility  to  prevent  fires.\r\n\r\nSir, indeed, that is what we have been doing very actively.   As\r\n\r\na  result,  we  have  been able to make  progress  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nbilateral  and regional cooperation on ways to tackle the  fires\r\n\r\nand haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked us to set up a special court to prosecute\r\n\r\noffenders, if I get it right.  Is that what he proposes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> It is a special court which will allow\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens or people who damage their companies  to  sue\r\n\r\nIndonesian companies directly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I am not a lawyer. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether this is a feasible approach.  I shall consult our  legal\r\n\r\nexperts.   But, as a layman, I would expect that any arrangement\r\n\r\nof   this  sort  must  have  the  agreement  of  our  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncounterparts.   As  I  said just now,  I  do  not  think  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething that is going to be very viable at the present moment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we may actually be souring up the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we release names of companies that\r\n\r\nare  involved in illegal burning and ensure that the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment  prosecutes  both Indonesian  companies  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  equally.  Sir, in fact, we have been asking  for  the\r\n\r\nnames  of the companies from Indonesia.  But till now,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  received any response.  I think part of the problem is that\r\n\r\nthey  have  difficulties  proving  guilt  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  that they have identified.  As such, I  think,  as  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  Mr  Tay would realise that until guilt is  proven,  one\r\n\r\nshould  not  start to penalise them.  Therefore, the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nauthorities  have  not come back to us with  the  names  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.  At the last meeting, the Minister told us  that  two\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  now  in the process of being prosecuted  and  we\r\n\r\nawait the outcome of these two cases when they come to court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that we promote eco-labels. Sir, we already\r\n\r\nhave  a  Eco-Labelling Scheme in place in Singapore.  It is  not\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to actively promote one class  of  products\r\n\r\nover  another.  It is for the consumers and this  is  where  the\r\n\r\nNGOs  may have a role.  If the NGOs feel very strongly that eco-labelling  is  useful  and  that products  with  eco-labels  are\r\n\r\nsupported, then I would propose that the NGOs who feel that  way\r\n\r\ntake an active role in promoting them.  But having said that, we\r\n\r\nhave to be aware of the potential negative implications.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  fears that many countries have expressed is the use of eco-labels  by  the  developed  countries as  a  protectionist  tool\r\n\r\nagainst\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproducts from developing countries which may not be able to meet\r\n\r\nthose  high  eco-standards set by the developed  countries.   In\r\n\r\nthis respect, I would urge NGOs, even if they are interested, to\r\n\r\nbe  a  bit circumspect and look at the full implications of  the\r\n\r\nscheme rather than look at very narrow aspects of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to identify and certify products which\r\n\r\nare  linked to the haze and fires.  Sir, we are not able  to  do\r\n\r\nthat  because,  in the first place, we do not  even  know  which\r\n\r\ncompanies are involved in deliberate fire setting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked us to issue advisory to Singapore companies\r\n\r\nabout their obligations to comply with the laws of the countries\r\n\r\nthey operate in.  Sir, we have stated these repeatedly that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expects all Singapore businessmen and  companies  to\r\n\r\nfully  comply  with the laws of the countries they  operate  in,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is in Indonesia, other parts of South East Asia,  or\r\n\r\ncountries   outside  the  region.   This  has  been  very   well\r\n\r\npublicised  and  I  am sure our companies and  businessmen  know\r\n\r\nthis.   Nevertheless, I would like to take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nremind   all  companies  that  are  operating  specifically   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to strictly comply with Indonesian laws  against  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  fires  for land clearing activities.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nremind  them  that,  as  in  all  cases,  where  companies   are\r\n\r\nprosecuted for contravening laws of other countries, they cannot\r\n\r\nexpect the Singapore Government to intervene on their behalf  if\r\n\r\nthey  are found guilty of being involved in such activities  and\r\n\r\nare heavily penalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked that we assist in investigating Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  if the Indonesian government requests us.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nfires  started and took place in Indonesia.  This is  where  the\r\n\r\ninvestigations have to be carried out.  I do not see what  value\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  add to investigation into the  fires  that  take\r\n\r\nplace in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also touched on those in Indonesia who want to help\r\n\r\nsolve   the  problem  and  that  we  should  help  them.    Sir,\r\n\r\ngovernments  have  to work on a government-to-government  basis.\r\n\r\nIf the NGOs in Indonesia are very much concerned about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  problem,  and  I  think they have got good  reasons  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the problem, then it is up to our NGOs  to  see\r\n\r\nwhat  they  can  do  to help them.  It is not possible  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  to intervene and actively  help  NGOs  in\r\n\r\nother countries on matters which affect those countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those points raised by Mr Zulkifli are in many ways similar\r\n\r\nto what Mr Tay has mentioned and I have addressed them too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by stressing that, despite all of\r\n\r\nASEAN's  efforts  and  even  with international  assistance,  we\r\n\r\ncannot be the ones to put out the fires in Indonesia.  The fires\r\n\r\ncan only be prevented and put out by Indonesia herself.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  has since indicated that she prefers to use  her  own\r\n\r\nfiremen to fight the fires.  What neighbouring countries and the\r\n\r\ninternational community can do is to help strengthen Indonesia's\r\n\r\ncapacity to detect fires early and put them out quickly.   ASEAN\r\n\r\nwill  also help Indonesia address efforts against slash-and-burn\r\n\r\npractices   and   urge  Indonesia  to  take  strong,   effective\r\n\r\nenforcement actions against irresponsible plantation owners.  On\r\n\r\nSingapore's  part, we have been actively helping Indonesia  over\r\n\r\nthe  past  year  to  address some of the challenges  related  to\r\n\r\nforest fires and haze.  In this respect, I agree with the motion\r\n\r\nby Mr Tay that we should do more and, indeed, we are doing more.\r\n\r\nBut these efforts and assistance should focus on areas which are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be productive and which will help us move the solution\r\n\r\nalong    rather   than   addressing   things   which   may    be\r\n\r\ncounterproductive.   But  we  also appreciate  that  our  utmost\r\n\r\nefforts  will  still  be not enough in  view  of  the  scale  of\r\n\r\nchallenge  facing  Indonesia.  We will therefore  also  help  by\r\n\r\ncontinuing to rally further support and assistance for Indonesia\r\n\r\nat the regional and international levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if I understand the\r\n\r\nMinister correctly, he supports the motion.  May I clarify  that\r\n\r\nwith him?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am heartened by that. But if I may very\r\n\r\nbriefly, given the hour, address some of the points.  I call for\r\n\r\nbasically a mix of carrots and sticks.  Of course, it is for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  our  country to determine the  actual  mix  and,\r\n\r\nagain,  I  see  the  greater experience  and  authority  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Government in determining what the mix  should\r\n\r\nbe  in its dealings with Indonesia.  As I said, I myself do  not\r\n\r\nfeel this is a Singapore-against-Indonesia issue and I hope  our\r\n\r\nIndonesian colleagues do not feel that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very much the victims of pollution against the people\r\n\r\nwho  created  the pollution, wherever they stand on the  border.\r\n\r\nBut,  however,  I must urge the Minister that the  route  he  is\r\n\r\ntaking  us  down, while increasing the capacity of Indonesia  to\r\n\r\nrespond,  will  not  necessarily  increase  the  will   of   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government  to  respond  and  that  we  should   not\r\n\r\ntherefore  give up all sanctions and pressures.  I am of  course\r\n\r\naware  that  ASEAN prefers to put those pressures behind  closed\r\n\r\ndoors.   I  then ask the Government to allow greater leeway  for\r\n\r\nNGOs  and people in Singapore to publicly express their concerns\r\n\r\nto  the  Indonesian  people  and  government  in  their  private\r\n\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish the Minister to consider that the eco-labels that he rejects should not be rejected out of hand. I\r\n\r\nurge  that  the  Government study them.   The  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  already administers all the existing eco-labels  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There are more than 20-over products under these eco-labels.  We should not surrender this possibility once companies\r\n\r\nare prosecuted, once names are named.  We should not abandon the\r\n\r\npower  to  go  against the bad guys in the marketplace.   If  we\r\n\r\ncannot  enforce Indonesian laws, we have a market for  which  we\r\n\r\ncan ask our consumers to make their voice known.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister cautioned against the danger of protectionism.\r\n\r\nI  am  reminded of course that our Minister for the  Environment\r\n\r\nwas  previously the Minister for Trade and Industry and this was\r\n\r\na  very  controversial issue and I share that concern.   But  we\r\n\r\nmust  see  clearly that in this issue of timber  and  oil  palm,\r\n\r\nthere is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nno danger that Singapore has protectionist measures in mind.  We\r\n\r\nhave got no timber and we have got no oil palm.  What we have in\r\n\r\nmind is not protectionism, but protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the government must work\r\n\r\nwith government and I believe that it is correct.  But there are\r\n\r\nmany tools in international law and international relations,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister well knows, to fund international agencies and  to\r\n\r\nhave international agencies support programmes and projects that\r\n\r\nseem  workable, whether these programmes and projects come  from\r\n\r\nNGOs or from Indonesia's host government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the Minister's support. I believe the\r\n\r\nMinister  has more to say.  Without possibly responding  to  him\r\n\r\nagain,  I just wish to add that, as Indonesia goes through  this\r\n\r\nperiod of reconstruction in environment, I urge, and this  point\r\n\r\nhas  not been addressed by the Minister for the Environment  or,\r\n\r\nperhaps it is to be addressed by the Government as a whole, that\r\n\r\nwe  engage Indonesia not purely in terms of the environment  but\r\n\r\non these issues, again I stress, on forestry, on agriculture, on\r\n\r\ntrade and industry and finance as a whole, because these are not\r\n\r\nabout  fires  per se but about economic imperatives  that  drive\r\n\r\nIndonesian   companies  or  Singapore  investors  in  Indonesian\r\n\r\ncompanies to do these bad practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Yeo, do you wish to clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to respond to a few of\r\n\r\nhis  points.   First,  on sanctions.  I  think  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nsanctions is best exemplified by the Americans.  The US  is  the\r\n\r\nsuperpower  of the world, in fact, the main power in the  world.\r\n\r\nThey  have  applied  sanctions to many countries  and,  in  many\r\n\r\ncases,  those sanctions have shown very minimal results,  if  at\r\n\r\nall.   In  the  context  of Singapore, I think  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nsanctions  would almost be laughable, and I think we should  not\r\n\r\ndo discredit to ourselves by doing something which would totally\r\n\r\nbe ineffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on eco-labels, yes, we already have the Eco-Labelling\r\n\r\nScheme.  But the Eco-Labelling Scheme is one which is very  well\r\n\r\nestablished,  and  the  scheme  recognises  products  which  are\r\n\r\nenvironmentally friendly.  What we have been trying  to  prevent\r\n\r\nis  the concept of eco-labelling that labels products which  are\r\n\r\nenvironmentally  unfriendly.  Because  that  opens  up  a  whole\r\n\r\nPandora's box of products which are environmentally unfriendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a factory that does not reduce humidity artificially and\r\n\r\nworkers are sweating away, is that an environmentally unfriendly\r\n\r\nfactory  to  the  workers?  If a country  which  has  very  poor\r\n\r\nsewerage   facilities  thereby  resulting  in   factories   also\r\n\r\ndischarging  wastes which are semi-treated into the open  drains\r\n\r\nwhich,  of course, in a developed country would be an absolutely\r\n\r\nno-no,  would  those  products be also declared  environmentally\r\n\r\nunfriendly and therefore given a black eco-label?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not that Singapore does not have any timber and\r\n\r\noil palms and therefore we came up with this black eco-label  on\r\n\r\ntimber and oil palm products.  It is the principle and the whole\r\n\r\nconcept of the Eco-Labelling Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a very well established reputation in the\r\n\r\ntrading  world.  Whatever we do, I can assure Members,  will  be\r\n\r\njumped  upon and distorted for their own use by other countries.\r\n\r\nDo we want to be the one to open the Pandora's box?  I think the\r\n\r\ncost  to us from opening such a Pandora's box will be many, many\r\n\r\ntimes  larger  than  the  worst haze  experience  we  have  ever\r\n\r\nencountered.   So  I would urge that while we have  an  area  of\r\n\r\nconcern,  let us not allow our concerns to overpower our  better\r\n\r\njudgment  and result in a bigger problem for not just  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  the  whole region.  This will also boomerang on us, because\r\n\r\nwe are so interlinked with economies of the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think that is a nice point to stop the\r\n\r\ndebate.

This has been\r\n\r\nthe hallmark of the PAP Government.  Today, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nshare  my  concerns  on the preparations for future  changes  in\r\n\r\nelectorate  trends  and the problems that  may  accompany  these\r\n\r\nchanges  in Singapore.  The implications for our future  leaders\r\n\r\nand  the  consequences to this country as a whole  are  immense.\r\n\r\nPlans  should be made, even as of now, or we will be faced  with\r\n\r\ninsurmountable problems.  Act before it is too late, so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  have a softer landing when facing the issue in the not  too\r\n\r\ndistant future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am talking about the changes in the pattern of the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  The number of people above 40 years of age,  as  of\r\n\r\nJune  1997, was 1,094,900 and this number will increase  as  the\r\n\r\nyears go by.  This group of electorate will be more educated and\r\n\r\nmore influential and they will present certain pressures when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to voting for their government.  They will probably lobby\r\n\r\nfor  special  requirements  and different  subsidies.   And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it will be in the interest of the Government  that  the\r\n\r\nneeds of these citizens are gratified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this in mind that we have to plan ahead, well\r\n\r\ninto the future, on balancing the whole process of providing for\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of one group without jeopardizing the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nanother   and  without  placing  undue  burdens  upon  continued\r\n\r\nprogress  of the State.  To succeed in this, we need a concerted\r\n\r\neffort by the various authorities to work hand in hand.  We also\r\n\r\nneed all Singaporeans to understand that some sacrifices have to\r\n\r\nbe accommodated for the sake of a successful Singapore for their\r\n\r\nchildren and grandchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that we look at the following as ways\r\n\r\nwhich  either the Government on its own, the Government together\r\n\r\nwith  the people or the people by themselves can adopt  to  help\r\n\r\nsolve this potential dilemma:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Promoting the right mindset</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important prerequisite for success in this aspect\r\n\r\nis  for  all  Singaporeans  to desire  self-reliance  and  self-sufficiency  without  burdening their  children  or  the  State.\r\n\r\nWhilst  such a mindset will not be easily achieved, it  must  be\r\n\r\nencouraged.   The Government must make the concept \"popular\"  to\r\n\r\nour  people  who  may, very likely, construe it as  yet  another\r\n\r\nburden  imposed  on  them.   Impart the  idea  effectively  with\r\n\r\nabundant  education  and  explanation.  Implement  new  policies\r\n\r\ngradually and with meaningful incentives so that the people  can\r\n\r\naccept  this  mindset without undue hardship.   Previously,  our\r\n\r\nforefathers' guarantee of future security and bliss was  through\r\n\r\nhaving  children.   Nowadays, the smaller family units  and  the\r\n\r\nliving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstyles  are minus points for any guarantees of security  through\r\n\r\nchildren  alone.   Added to this, the limited resources  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  mean  that, in future, we will need  every  able-bodied\r\n\r\ncitizen  to be in the workforce so  as to maximize our  economic\r\n\r\nworth.   We can expect to hit a dependency ratio of 3  to  1  in\r\n\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Saving more for the golden years</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for more personal savings from now. The\r\n\r\nmessage  should be \"save as much as you can now for your comfort\r\n\r\nin  the  future\".  The CPF compulsory savings can only be enough\r\n\r\nfor  subsistence levels of living and indeed may not  be  enough\r\n\r\nfor  the  old-age,  especially when  we  will  see  longer  life\r\n\r\nexpectancy of people even beyond 80 years of age.  For the  more\r\n\r\naffluent  middle-aged  Singaporeans,  there  is  an  even   more\r\n\r\npressing  need to save because they would have become accustomed\r\n\r\nto more expensive lifestyles.  Moderation on their spending will\r\n\r\nprevent  their  life earnings from being wiped out  for  a  more\r\n\r\ngraceful lifestyle in old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building up family ties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting family values and improving family ties is of\r\n\r\nfundamental  importance as the building block  of  our  society.\r\n\r\nWith  our fast-paced lifestyles, it now looks like we have  even\r\n\r\nmore  reasons to step up nation-wide efforts in promoting  these\r\n\r\nvalues  in  our  society.  Government policies  can  be  further\r\n\r\nenhanced  to  make this necessity a reality.  We  can  never  do\r\n\r\nenough.   The  virtues  of  a closely knit  family  circle,  and\r\n\r\nespecially  of a three-tier family, loving and caring  for  each\r\n\r\nother,  should  be  accentuated within our society  through  the\r\n\r\nschools, the grassroots organisations and the whole community in\r\n\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Encouraging self-sufficient lifestyles</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pipeline, and certainly on the right track, are the\r\n\r\nstudio  apartments which will be built for our senior  citizens.\r\n\r\nThey,   however,  are  only  the  hardware  for  self-sufficient\r\n\r\nlifestyles.  It is important that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsoftware  is  available alongside.  Hence, the various  concepts\r\n\r\nthat   promote  self-help  activities  and  social  interactions\r\n\r\namongst  the  dwellers  of  these  studio  apartments  with  the\r\n\r\neventual formation of \"buddy groups\" helping each other,  should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged.  Only when we have this software in  place  will\r\n\r\nthe  studio  apartments  package reach the  maximal  values  and\r\n\r\nsuccess in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prolonging employability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not sufficient just to raise the retirement age.\r\n\r\nMore  must  be  done  to help the older folk  get  back  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   The  authorities in Government  and  the  employers\r\n\r\nshould  try to provide more opportunities for older workers  and\r\n\r\ncreate  special  but  meaningful jobs  for  them.   It  is  also\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  train those who are willing  and  allow  them  to\r\n\r\ncontribute with dignity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a medical doctor, I cannot help but to also mention the\r\n\r\nnext two points.  They are, of course, related to the healthcare\r\n\r\naspects  of  this issue.  I have made mention of them previously\r\n\r\nand they are:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintaining healthy lifestyles</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any population, just by maintaining healthy lifestyles, can\r\n\r\nreduce  severe  disabilities by as much as 60%.   Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  adopt  a  more proactive approach to promote  this  idea\r\n\r\nnation-wide.   People  from all walks of  life,  and  especially\r\n\r\nthose  near retirement or at retirement age, should be  reached.\r\n\r\nThis  latter group whose lives may span another 25 years  or  so\r\n\r\nwill  benefit  the  most.  Preventive care,  rather  than  acute\r\n\r\nhospital  care,  is the way to go and it will save  us  all  the\r\n\r\nmoney  and  save us from the agony in the end. It is  inevitable\r\n\r\nthat  we  will also have dependent cases that require much  more\r\n\r\nhelp.  We will need to train more care-providers.  We will  also\r\n\r\nneed  to  provide  more care-services.  Both of  these,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  are  not sufficient and are certainly  not  capable  of\r\n\r\ncoping with the increasing demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Keeping healthcare cost affordable</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave and MediShield have limitations. Moreover, they\r\n\r\ndo not cater for those who suffer from  chronic illnesses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   require  substantial  expenses  without  warding  in   the\r\n\r\nhospitals.   There may be a place to add a further  \"safety-net\"\r\n\r\ninsurance  to fill the gap left out by Medisave and  MediShield.\r\n\r\nThis insurance is to be used before resorting to Medifund which,\r\n\r\notherwise,  will be undesirably and excessively drained  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The  need  to  be cared for sufficiently  in  case  of\r\n\r\ncatastrophic illnesses, the inevitable escalation of  healthcare\r\n\r\ncost  in future, the expected increase in the life-span of  most\r\n\r\npeople  to  80  years of age or more and hence  the  inescapable\r\n\r\nincrease  in  incidence  of  catastrophic  illnesses  should  be\r\n\r\nhighlighted.   This  extra insurance scheme  must  be  carefully\r\n\r\nexplained to the Medisave and MediShield subscribers lest it  be\r\n\r\nconstrued as yet another \"pay and pay\" burden.  There must be an\r\n\r\nincentive  for  saving further here.  Some  form  of  co-payment\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and the subscribers and the respite  from\r\n\r\nhaving  to save more in the Medisave or paying more premium  for\r\n\r\nMediShield may be the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes to future trends of the electorate in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  problems they portend and the implications  for\r\n\r\nall  of  us  are immense.  I beg the indulgence of our Ministers\r\n\r\nand  my  parliamentary  colleagues to  look  further  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment (Mr Chan Soo Sen): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, firstly I\r\n\r\nwould  like to thank the hon. Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin  for\r\n\r\nthe reminder for us to prepare for future changes in demographic\r\n\r\nprofile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the word \"reminder\" because the Government has been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in the last 40 years in planning ahead, anticipating\r\n\r\nproblems,  and  in  acting  early  before  the  problems  become\r\n\r\nserious.   We  have also been fortunate in having an  electorate\r\n\r\nthat is prepared to think long term and accept necessary, though\r\n\r\nnot  always,  popular measures.  Our challenge, in fact,  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  this  time-proven way of doing things,  which  has\r\n\r\nproven  to  have  served us so well in the last  40  years,  can\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the demographic trend outlined\r\n\r\nby   the   hon.  Member.   Because  of  Government's   education\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  our  electorate will become better  educated,  more\r\n\r\ncreative,  and want to participate more actively in  matters  of\r\n\r\nstate.   I  would  want  to say that these  are  strengths,  not\r\n\r\nweaknesses.  If more of our electorate participate more actively\r\n\r\nin  the decision-making process, ownership towards policies will\r\n\r\nincrease,  commitment to our country will be enhanced,  and  our\r\n\r\npeople  will  be more cohesive.  A thriving people  sector  will\r\n\r\nchannel  the  energy  of our better educated electorate  towards\r\n\r\nnation-building.  Together we will build a better Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would also like to submit that a lot of these\r\n\r\nare already taking place.  The Government has, over the last  20\r\n\r\nyears or so, gradually empowered the local communities to manage\r\n\r\ntheir  own  affairs. With Town Councils, local communities  take\r\n\r\ncharge  of  estate  management and  upgrading.   With  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Councils, local communities develop the heart-ware.\r\n\r\nThe  Government is actually looking ahead into the 21st  century\r\n\r\nby  forming the Singapore 21 Committee to map out strategies for\r\n\r\nnation-building.   The Committee has been involving  the  people\r\n\r\nsector  extensively  to discuss the five dilemmas,  and  we  can\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  people sector will be actively engaged  because\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of  the Committee, RAdm Teo  Chee  Hean,  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister who first coined this term called \"people sector\".  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  is working on five sets of now very famous  dilemmas.\r\n\r\n(1)  Internationalisation/Regionalisation  versus  Singapore  as\r\n\r\nHome;  (2)  Less Stressful Life versus Retaining the Drive;  (3)\r\n\r\nAttracting  Talent versus Looking after Singaporeans;   (4)  The\r\n\r\nNeeds  of  Senior Citizens versus The Aspirations of the  Young;\r\n\r\nand    (5)  Consultation and Consensus versus  Decisiveness  and\r\n\r\nQuick Action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of posing the challenges as pairs of dilemmas\r\n\r\nis  precisely to exercise the creativity of our better  educated\r\n\r\nand  more articulate electorate to prioritise and trade off,  to\r\n\r\nthink  of  short-term sacrifices for long  term  good.   As  the\r\n\r\nCommittee with participation from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  people sector puts up recommendations to resolve  the  five\r\n\r\nsets  of  dilemmas, a broad cross section of Singaporeans  would\r\n\r\nhave   been  engaged  and  have  participated  in  mapping   out\r\n\r\nSingapore's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the hon. Member that having the right\r\n\r\nmindset is important.  However, mindset comes with experience in\r\n\r\nlife.  Speaking  with the older Singaporeans  in  their  50s  or\r\n\r\nolder,  one  would hear the concern that the younger generations\r\n\r\ndo  not have strong community spirit because they have not  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  hard  times  such as the Japanese  occupation  and  our\r\n\r\ndifficult road to nationhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the current economic difficulties brought about by\r\n\r\nthe regional financial turmoil has provided valuable lessons for\r\n\r\nall  of  us,  especially for the younger ones. We  are  reminded\r\n\r\nabout  our vulnerability, the importance of electing a good  and\r\n\r\nclean  government,  the value of social cohesion,  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for  sudden  misfortunes  even  though  we  feel   very\r\n\r\ncomfortable and secure.  In Chinese, we call it ju an si  wei  (\r\n\r\n)  and  that we cannot take success and prosperity for  granted.\r\n\r\nThese  reminders  will  shape  our  mindset  and  will  help  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  us.   I believe the memory of this turmoil  will  be\r\n\r\nwith  us  for some time.  So let us stay united and cohesive  to\r\n\r\nget over this period of difficulty.  I believe we will emerge as\r\n\r\na  more  matured  country, with a more resilient  and  confident\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also addressed many issues associated\r\n\r\nwith  a  more aged society, including the need to stay  healthy,\r\n\r\nhaving  affordable  health care, and achieving  financial  self-reliant.  My experience talking to the older Singaporeans in the\r\n\r\ncourse of my work confirms that there has been awareness of  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  prepare  for the golden years, and a clear  desire  to\r\n\r\nensure  self-reliance.  Older Singaporeans do  not  want  to  be\r\n\r\nburdens to our younger generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area that Singapore has made tremendous\r\n\r\nachievement in, ie, housing.  Nearly all our senior citizens do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  need to worry about roofs over their heads because  of  our\r\n\r\nvery   successful  public  housing  programme.    This   is   an\r\n\r\nachievement  which  is  outstanding,  and  not  many   developed\r\n\r\ncountries could even equal us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonging employability is also important, and I do agree.\r\n\r\nHowever,  one  can  be  employable only if one's  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  remain relevant and marketable.  As jobs and  technology\r\n\r\nchange  very  rapidly, we should inculcate in  us  a  spirit  of\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning and regular skills upgrading so that  we  can\r\n\r\nall prolong our employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council, People's Association, and the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development Councils will continue to promote  sports\r\n\r\nand healthy lifestyle.  The hon. Member is a medical doctor.   I\r\n\r\nhave to agree with her that prevention is better than cure,  and\r\n\r\na good health should not be taken for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health will also continue to watch\r\n\r\nhealthcare  costs,  and  ensure that healthcare  is  affordable.\r\n\r\nMedisave, Medifund and MediShield will be refined as we go along\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that our people are better served.  In addition,  we\r\n\r\nalso  notice  that  the  private sector  has  developed  various\r\n\r\nmedical  insurance and savings packages.  The NTUC has also  set\r\n\r\nup  Eldercare  Cooperative to initiate programmes to  serve  the\r\n\r\nolder  persons.  I am confident that there will be more  schemes\r\n\r\nfor  middle-aged persons to prepare for the golden years,  since\r\n\r\nthis is very obviously what the market wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than health and cost of living, there is one area\r\n\r\nthat  concerns  an older person very much, ie,  loneliness.   To\r\n\r\ncounter  this,  the  Ministry  of  Community  Development   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to promote the importance of the family.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education will also continue to inculcate in our  young  the\r\n\r\nvalue of respecting the old and caring for them.  Social service\r\n\r\norganisations will also help families develop skills  in  caring\r\n\r\nfor  the  needs of the old and developing expertise  in  elderly\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to promoting the importance of the family, we\r\n\r\nshould also rediscover and promote the importance of mutual help\r\n\r\namongst  neighbours.   Grassroots organisations  in  the  senior\r\n\r\ncitizen's HDB apartments will give greater emphasis on promoting\r\n\r\nmutual  help amongst neighbours and working with social  service\r\n\r\norganisations.   The  Ministry  of  Community  Development,  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association as well as the HDB will look into how  such\r\n\r\norganisations will be set up.  With the spirit of community self-help,  the residents will live better and have a stronger  sense\r\n\r\nof self-confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are already discussing the challenge of an aging\r\n\r\npopulation   years  before  it  actually  happens.   Government,\r\n\r\nprivate  sector and the community are already active in  putting\r\n\r\nthe various schemes in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplace.   This  is  another  proof that we  act  before  problems\r\n\r\nbecome  serious.   I believe we should have a soft  landing.  An\r\n\r\nactive  people  sector will help us to be  even  more  alert  to\r\n\r\nimpending problems, and increase commitment and ownership to the\r\n\r\nsolutions.

As  the  Member  may\r\n\r\nknow,  Singapore  became  a  party  to  the  Convention  on  the\r\n\r\nElimination  of  Discrimination against Women  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nConvention  on the Rights of the Child in October 1995.  Whether\r\n\r\nwe will accede to any other international convention will depend\r\n\r\non   careful  examination  of  our  policies,  laws  and   legal\r\n\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take our international obligations seriously and accede\r\n\r\nto  international treaties only when it is in our interest to do\r\n\r\nand  when we are fully satisfied that we can give effect to  its\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REDEVELOPMENT OF DEFU INDUSTRIAL ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  if  he  will  modify the  plan  to  redevelop  Defu\r\n\r\nIndustrial Estate in view of the economic slowdown and the  over\r\n\r\nsupply of industrial space in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, HDB announced the redevelopment programme for\r\n\r\nits   industrial   estates.   The   main   objectives   of   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment  programme are to provide better  facilities  that\r\n\r\nwill meet the operational requirements of the industrial tenants\r\n\r\nas well as to optimise the use of industrial sites.  The current\r\n\r\nHDB  industrial  properties are sorely in need of redevelopment.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these were built many years ago and do  not  meet  the\r\n\r\nindustrial needs of today - for example, the electrical capacity\r\n\r\nis  insufficient  and there is no provision for  heavy  vehicles\r\n\r\nlike  container trucks.  If we do not do anything, the  premises\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to meet the industrialists' requirements  and,\r\n\r\nover time, they will be less and less competitive.  As such, the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Redevelopment Programme has to continue.  Since HDB's\r\n\r\nredevelopment programme is mainly concerned with re-housing  its\r\n\r\nindustrial tenants and the total number of units that it manages\r\n\r\nis  less  than  10%  of the total stock of industrial  space  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the programme will not contribute to an  over-supply\r\n\r\nof industrial space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Defu Industrial Estate, it is currently not\r\n\r\ndue yet for redevelopment.  HDB will give the tenants sufficient\r\n\r\nnotice before it is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, HDB will provide various measures to help\r\n\r\nindustrial tenants relocate to new premises during this economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.    These  measures  include  firstly,   an   ex-gratia\r\n\r\ncompensation of $48,000 per unit for industrial tenants affected\r\n\r\nby  relocation.  Secondly, an option will be given to industrial\r\n\r\ntenants to either purchase or rent the replacement units. Prices\r\n\r\nwill  be  kept  at affordable levels by selling the  replacement\r\n\r\nunits  at a shorter lease period of 30 years.  Singapore citizen\r\n\r\ntenants will also be given a 5%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscount  of  the  market price. Tenants who  opt  to  rent  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  units will be allowed to pay existing rental  rates\r\n\r\non  a  per  square metre basis for the remaining term  of  their\r\n\r\nexisting tenancies.  Thirdly, industrial tenants will be given a\r\n\r\ntwo-month  rent-free  fitting-up period.  This  period  will  be\r\n\r\nextended to six months for Singapore citizen tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
