Marshall):</b> If it\r\n\r\nplease  you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I should  like  to\r\n\r\nmake a statement on my forthcoming visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received an invitation from the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Ceylon to visit Ceylon, and I  shall\r\n\r\nbe  their guest on the 2nd and 3rd of December.  I\r\n\r\nhave   also  received  an  invitation   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  India, and with my  colleague  the\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister for Commerce and Industry  (Mr\r\n\r\nJ. M. Jumabhoy), will be their guests in Bombay on\r\n\r\nthe  5th, and we will be in New Delhi between  the\r\n\r\n6th and the 9th of December. I am scheduled to  be\r\n\r\nin London with the Minister for Labour and Welfare\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Yew  Hock) and the Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul  Hamid\r\n\r\nBin  Haji Jumat) between the 9th and the  16th  of\r\n\r\nDecember. Although the suggestion, Sir, originally\r\n\r\ncame from the Secretary of State that it would  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  if  we were to visit England towards  the\r\n\r\nend  of  this year, there is no indication as  yet\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be the guests of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nduring  our  seven-day stay in  London.  We  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  be the guests of the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State at official functions.  On\r\n\r\nour  return  journey we have been invited  by  the\r\n\r\nPakistan Government to be their guests, and it  is\r\n\r\nprobable  that  all  three Ministers  will  be  in\r\n\r\nKarachi for one or two days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to indicate briefly the reasons for\r\n\r\nthese courtesy visits and the London visit. During\r\n\r\nthe  many functions that attended the Colombo Plan\r\n\r\nconference,  Sir, here in Singapore,  I  became\r\n\r\nconscious  of feelings of friendship for Singapore\r\n\r\nand  strong sympathy for its political aspirations\r\n\r\nfrom  many countries, both inside and outside  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.  The  visits to  Ceylon,  India  and\r\n\r\nPakistan  are intended to strengthen this friendly\r\n\r\nfeeling  and  this sympathy. I would  add  that  I\r\n\r\nexpect  to learn a great deal from the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthese  countries  who  have arduously  blazed  the\r\n\r\ntrail  to independence, a trail which we  are  now\r\n\r\nfollowing. All Singapore, I am sure, is  proud  of\r\n\r\nthe  honour India, Pakistan and Ceylon do  us  in\r\n\r\nextending these official invitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the visit to London, I wish to reiterate that,\r\n\r\napart from seeking to obtain clarification of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattitude   to   the  Labour  Front's   citizenship\r\n\r\nproposals, we shall seek officially only to fix  a\r\n\r\ndate  for a constitutional conference and to agree\r\n\r\non  an  agenda.  For the rest, Sir,  during  those\r\n\r\nseven  days my colleagues and I will be addressing\r\n\r\na large number of gatherings. We will seek to make\r\n\r\nEngland conscious of the fact that in this  lovely\r\n\r\nisland of ours there are more than 1,200,000 human\r\n\r\nbeings  with a human being's primordial  urge  and\r\n\r\nmoral right to be free from subjugation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter that I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch  on. The Government of Thailand has extended\r\n\r\nan  invitation  to  us to visit  Thailand  on  our\r\n\r\nreturn  journey.  It is our view  that  the  first\r\n\r\nvisit to a close trading neighbour should be of  a\r\n\r\nfuller  character than would be possible  in  this\r\n\r\nhurried  visit.  Many of us are conscious  of  the\r\n\r\nimpetus  of the goodwill mission to Indonesia  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  the realm of commerce but especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  realm of friendly relations which will be  an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor in our future. I have  therefore\r\n\r\nindicated to the Thai Government, Sir, that we are\r\n\r\ngrateful for the honour they do us, but are unable\r\n\r\nto  accept  the  invitation at  present.  We  look\r\n\r\nforward  with  pleasurable  anticipation  to   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of an invitation for a  full  mission\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore to visit Thailand in the new year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the last few days we have listened to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar speaking on motions  to\r\n\r\nremove new posts from the Estimates. These motions\r\n\r\nhave  covered a wide field - in fact, all the posts\r\n\r\nwhich an expatriate might conceivably be appointed\r\n\r\nto,  or  required for, or promoted to. The  reason\r\n\r\ngenerally given for the motion was that  the  post\r\n\r\nwas  unnecessary  and that it should  be  removed.\r\n\r\nLatterly, however, he came out into the  open  and\r\n\r\nsuggested that the posts were deliberately created\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the expatriates now envisaging\r\n\r\nabolition  and  that  the elected  Ministers  had,\r\n\r\nshall  we  say, been hoodwinked into  agreeing  to\r\n\r\ntheir  inclusion. I had intended  to  answer  that\r\n\r\nsuggestion yesterday, Sir, but I thought perhaps I\r\n\r\nmight speak in heat and it would be better that  I\r\n\r\ndeferred  the matter until today. That suggestion,\r\n\r\nSir,  is a base and dishonourable suggestion which\r\n\r\ncan only stem from ignoble and dishonest minds. It\r\n\r\nimpugns  the intelligence of the elected Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the  integrity  of the  civil  service,  both\r\n\r\nexpatriate and locally domiciled, which  over  the\r\n\r\npast 80 years, by its unswerving devotion to duty,\r\n\r\nits  conscientiousness, its  incorruptibility  and\r\n\r\nits sense of justice and fair play, has built up a\r\n\r\nreputation  second to none. The suggestion  is  so\r\n\r\nridiculous that no one will believe it, apart from\r\n\r\na handful of unhappy bigots who conceived it and a\r\n\r\nmeasure   of   whose  judgment  and  ability   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion is. Even the hon. mover of the  motion,\r\n\r\nbeing  a  man  of great intellectual  ability  and\r\n\r\nintegrity,  knows in his heart that it  is  false,\r\n\r\nabsolutely false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I explain the procedure in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  applications for new posts, it will put  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion in its true perspective. Proposals  for\r\n\r\nnew posts must be in the hands of the Treasury  by\r\n\r\nthe 15th of April. The great majority are received\r\n\r\nin February and March. The proposals put up by the\r\n\r\nheads  of  departments are considered  with  great\r\n\r\ncare  in the Treasury. Many factors, such  as  the\r\n\r\nplanned  expansion  of a department  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  needs  of the public, the  duties  to  be\r\n\r\nperformed,   the  qualifications  and   experience\r\n\r\nrequired,   the  responsibilities  to  be   borne,\r\n\r\nstaffing requirements generally - all these matters\r\n\r\nare considered in the Treasury. Other branches  of\r\n\r\nGovernment are consulted. The head of a department\r\n\r\nhimself  is called up to amplify and explain  his\r\n\r\nproposals.  In  the  end  all  the  proposals  are\r\n\r\nconsidered against the background of the financial\r\n\r\nposition  of  the  Colony,  and  only  those   are\r\n\r\napproved  for  entry in the Draft Estimates  which\r\n\r\nare  absolutely imperative for the successful  and\r\n\r\nefficient  conduct of the business of  government.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection over the years, the  Treasury\r\n\r\nhas  built up perhaps an unenviable reputation for\r\n\r\nbeing difficult in respect of new appointments.  I\r\n\r\nshould  also like to make it quite clear  that  in\r\n\r\ndeciding whether an appointment should be  entered\r\n\r\nor  not,  the  only criterion - I repeat,  the  only\r\n\r\ncriterion - is  need,  the need of  Government,  the\r\n\r\nneed of the public. The question whom the post  is\r\n\r\nto be filled by is completely irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the posts entered this year have\r\n\r\nsatisfied this criterion and need. They have  been\r\n\r\nproposed   by   officers  of  long  administrative\r\n\r\nexperience  who  have  only  the  efficiency   and\r\n\r\nsuccessful operation of their departments in mind,\r\n\r\nmen  who, as a result of that experience, can look\r\n\r\nahead  and see the needs of the future. They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  vetted by a succession of officers  of  wide\r\n\r\nadministrative  and  financial  experience,  whose\r\n\r\nduty  it  is - and  they have never failed  in  that\r\n\r\nduty - to  eliminate  any  proposal  which  is   not\r\n\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has now happened, Sir, is that the judgment\r\n\r\nof  these acknowledged experts has been challenged\r\n\r\nand  called in question by a small band  of  civil\r\n\r\nservants who, to the best of my knowledge, are not\r\n\r\nqualified  to  say  whether  posts  in,  say,  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Department, or the Audit  Department,  or\r\n\r\nthe Accountant-General's Department, are necessary\r\n\r\nor   not  in  the  public  interests  or  for  the\r\n\r\nefficient  discharge  of government  business.  In\r\n\r\nexpressing  these opinions, they  appear  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen actuated by motives which reasonable men  and\r\n\r\nwomen would spurn with contempt. What they say  in\r\n\r\neffect  is  this: that it is better  that  a  post\r\n\r\nshould  remain uncreated or unfilled  rather  than\r\n\r\nthat  they should run the risk of having it filled\r\n\r\nby an expatriate. All I can say is this, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthis bigoted judgment will be small comfort to the\r\n\r\nparents  of  a  child whose life is  perhaps  lost\r\n\r\nbecause   specialised   knowledge   which    might\r\n\r\notherwise have been available is lacking. That,  I\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, sums up the matter. The honest opinion\r\n\r\nof disinterested civil servants of long experience\r\n\r\nis called in question by a small band of bigots of\r\n\r\nlittle or no experience. I think judgment in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  can  safely  be left  to  the  intelligent\r\n\r\nmembers of the public and to the large body of the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  with whom I have worked  for  many\r\n\r\nyears and for whom I have the highest respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I should like to touch on the\r\n\r\nsuggestion that elected Ministers were,  shall  we\r\n\r\nsay,  hoodwinked.

This has  been\r\n\r\ndone. The need for each post was examined in great\r\n\r\ndetail.  Heads of departments were called  up  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion in most cases. Some posts were deleted.\r\n\r\nThose  which remain are those which satisfied  the\r\n\r\nelected Ministers that they were essential for the\r\n\r\nefficient discharge of government business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I think I have only got a minute\r\n\r\nor  two  left,  Mr Chairman, to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter.

What is going to happen in the future will\r\n\r\nbe  that  the  Executive Engineer  concerned  with\r\n\r\ndefence works will still continue to do it, but if\r\n\r\nthe defence work is slack for a period, he can  do\r\n\r\nother  work. If there is a lot of defence work  to\r\n\r\nbe  done, then another engineer can help him  with\r\n\r\nit;  that is the simple effect of this change.

Finally, however, it  was  decided\r\n\r\nfirst  to go forward with a pilot scheme to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the waters of Alexandra would run away\r\n\r\nin  a westerly direction and the reverse direction\r\n\r\nfrom  what  it  does  at  present  at  a  cost  of\r\n\r\n$120,000,  of  which  Government  agreed  to   pay\r\n\r\n$60,000.  Eventually this scheme was completed,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  about  nine  months  ago  at  a  cost   of\r\n\r\n$200,000, the extra cost being due largely to  the\r\n\r\nneed  to purchase land from the War Department.  I\r\n\r\nsay  this scheme was successfully completed in the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  of nine months ago and  I  think  I\r\n\r\nstated  in this House in April that the water  was\r\n\r\nrunning  away in the right direction, that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay, in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened since then? A lot of the\r\n\r\ncanal has silted up. Enterprising farmers are  now\r\n\r\ngrowing  water-hyacinth in ponds for  their  pigs,\r\n\r\nand  the water at the top end of the canal is  now\r\n\r\nrunning  in  the opposite direction  back  towards\r\n\r\nAlexandra  and the city. It seems  to  me  that  a\r\n\r\nscheme which has cost the public $200,000 and  was\r\n\r\nsuccessful  should be followed up immediately  and\r\n\r\nthat  money should have been granted in  the  1956\r\n\r\nEstimates to see that what has been done  already\r\n\r\nis not wasted but is being carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I have only got\r\n\r\nat  present  the  preliminary very  brief  mention\r\n\r\nabout Ulu Pandan.

With  your\r\n\r\npermission, Mr Chairman, Sir, before I  touch  on\r\n\r\nthis subject, I wish to remind all Members in this\r\n\r\nHouse that, despite so many Party differences, yet\r\n\r\nwe  have  at least one common aim, that  is,  this\r\n\r\ncountry  is  going  to  get  rid  of  colonialism.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we must also get rid of  the  colonial\r\n\r\neducational policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have had a chance to\r\n\r\nglance  at  the development estimate on education.\r\n\r\nOne  glance  and we can see that this  is  another\r\n\r\ncolonial  educational  policy.  We  cannot   trace\r\n\r\nanything at all that shows that the Government has\r\n\r\nkept   its  word  when  it  promised  during   the\r\n\r\nelections,  \"Equality of education for all  races!\r\n\r\nPreservation  and promotion of all cultures!\"  Our\r\n\r\nChief  Minister even went to the extent of talking\r\n\r\nduring  the  elections about lifting the  language\r\n\r\nbarrier in this country, and I am sure, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nall  this is connected with education. We  believe\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe educational policy of any country in the world\r\n\r\nis  always of prime importance. Whoever can  carry\r\n\r\nout  a  healthy and constructive policy  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  bring about immediate benefit to the country\r\n\r\nbut benefit for a long, long time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we look at the Estimates, we see a\r\n\r\nnumber  of new secondary schools scheduled  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt.  I  wish  the Minister for Education  would\r\n\r\nclearly  indicate to us how many of these will  be\r\n\r\nMalay  secondary schools; how many will be Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools; and also whether  any  primary\r\n\r\nschool is to be built during the coming year. Sir,\r\n\r\nwe   cannot  understand  Government's  policy   on\r\n\r\neducation. On the one hand, it promises the people\r\n\r\nthat  their  cultural position would  be  secured.\r\n\r\nThey   say,  \"We  are  going  to  give  you   fair\r\n\r\ntreatment.\"  Yet,  on  the other  hand,  they  are\r\n\r\npromoting only English education. Although we  are\r\n\r\nvery  happy to note that more money is voted  this\r\n\r\nyear,   we  must  not  forget  that  the  previous\r\n\r\nLegislative  Council - we very often called  them  a\r\n\r\ncolonial Legislative Council - unhesitatingly  gave\r\n\r\n$12 millions to improve Chinese education. Whether\r\n\r\nthis   grant  met  with  welcome  or   just   only\r\n\r\nresentment  or  even  fear and  suspicion  is  not\r\n\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is now high time for the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education to have the courage to make\r\n\r\na  start  to  get rid of the colonial  educational\r\n\r\npolicy in this country. My sympathies quite  often\r\n\r\ngo to many Ministries which have been attacked by\r\n\r\nthe  forceful and learned Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwho  accuses the Ministers of being influenced too\r\n\r\nmuch by their expatriate assistants. But, Sir,  my\r\n\r\nsympathies  do  not,  in  the  least,  go  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education. I believe the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation has betrayed Chinese education. He, more\r\n\r\nthan  anybody else, should understand the  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool   tradition  in  this  country.  He  should\r\n\r\nhimself  deal with the policy on Chinese education\r\n\r\nor even vernacular education and should not depend\r\n\r\nsolely  upon the expatriate officers.

But that  does\r\n\r\nnot  entitle them to say, \"Well, I am an  educated\r\n\r\nman.\"  We  cannot, on the one hand,  give  fervent\r\n\r\nsupport to Government's policy in building so many\r\n\r\nEnglish schools to promote English education, and,\r\n\r\non  the other hand, stop vernacular education from\r\n\r\nprogressing.  So I want to repeat that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nclear whether our Minister himself has framed  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment aspect of education in this Budget  or\r\n\r\nwhether  he has only been consulted. Have  I  your\r\n\r\npermission to point out how much our Ministers are\r\n\r\ninfluenced by the expatriate officers? Can I?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

I repeat: the Government is\r\n\r\nall the time carrying out investigations into ways\r\n\r\nand  means of reducing the cost of buildings,  but\r\n\r\nit  must  be borne in mind that economy on capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  must  not be offset  by  increase  in\r\n\r\nmaintenance  costs.  It  is  also  important  that\r\n\r\nschools  should be built, but we do not want  them\r\n\r\nto have a quality, which is so inferior as to be a\r\n\r\nreproach to our legislators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, sitting on a Committee in the P.W.D.,\r\n\r\nexpert  educationists who can  advise  how  class-rooms  could  be reduced in size, how the  ceiling\r\n\r\ncould be reduced in height, and we are working out\r\n\r\na  scheme  whereby the cost of buildings  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education has not  answered  my\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary  has complimented  the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard on collecting a lot of revenue. I think that\r\n\r\ncompliment  must be qualified. Here  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nyou  do  find  that many people live in  congested\r\n\r\nsurroundings  right in the heart of this  city.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  should be the policy of  Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage  people to live in the rural areas,  and\r\n\r\nif  you  are  going to encourage them to  live  in\r\n\r\nhealthier  rural areas, you should bring  to  them\r\n\r\nmore  amenities of life. As a person who has  been\r\n\r\nliving  in the rural area for a very long time,  I\r\n\r\ncan safely say that the amenities there are not up\r\n\r\nto  standard. The roads must be greatly  improved.\r\n\r\nPlaying  fields must be provided in  almost  every\r\n\r\ndistrict.  I will just give one aspect  of  living\r\n\r\nconditions - the night-soil system. It is  not  good\r\n\r\nin the rural areas and needs looking into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things need money, and yet we have\r\n\r\nfour  million odd dollars for an area which is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, ten times greater than the city area.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think  this  sum is inadequate  and  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased so that there will be more encouragement\r\n\r\nfor   people  to  live  outside  the  city   area.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  if  this sum were  increased,  there\r\n\r\nwould not be the necessity of increasing rates.  I\r\n\r\nhave   heard  the  Hon. the  Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands  and  Housing  state  that   $2\r\n\r\nincrease   a  month  for  all  the  amenities   in\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Garden is justifiable. There should  be\r\n\r\nno  complaint about it. But I would like to inform\r\n\r\nhim  that  when a person buys a house in Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden,  he buys it with a promise that all  these\r\n\r\namenities  will be part of the price he  pays  for\r\n\r\nit.  But  after a year you say, \"No, the value  is\r\n\r\ngreater.  All that we have promised to install  is\r\n\r\nnot going to be installed unless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe put an added value on the house.\"  That, I\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, is not justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, may I remind the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon that the promise made  was  not  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  or the Rural Board, but by the  owners\r\n\r\nof  the estate themselves; and that, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board  house owners have  had  considerable\r\n\r\nencouragement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also remind him that they pay 60 per\r\n\r\ncent of the assessment that the city dweller pays.\r\n\r\nThe assessment on the annual value of their houses\r\n\r\nis  20 per cent. The city dweller pays 32 per cent\r\n\r\nin respect of the annual value of his premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure the Member for Serangoon is\r\n\r\nconscious of the fact that he cannot get  services\r\n\r\nwithout payment, and payment ultimately comes from\r\n\r\nthe public. The system of assessment is considered\r\n\r\na  fair one and has so far worked reasonably  well\r\n\r\nin that the persons who have the amenities and are\r\n\r\nin  a  position to pay, do pay. A man who  owns  a\r\n\r\nhouse  has his premises assessed, and I understand\r\n\r\nit  is  very conservatively assessed at an  annual\r\n\r\nvalue  of, say, $100 and he pays per year on  that\r\n\r\nin the rural area only $20. If he gets $100 rent a\r\n\r\nmonth  he  pays on that rate for all the amenities\r\n\r\nthat  make possible the occupation of the premises\r\n\r\nin question, $20 a month to the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this, that there is no\r\n\r\nquestion whatsoever but that the amenities in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas should be improved. On this I  am  in\r\n\r\ncomplete  agreement with the Member for Serangoon,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  certainly our hope, Sir, to  continue\r\n\r\nwhat  has  already been done in the way of  giving\r\n\r\ngreater  amenities  to  the  areas  outside   city\r\n\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,239,780 for Head D 45 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 49 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $10 for Head D 49 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 39 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $200,020 for Head D 39 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 52 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $220,000 the sum to be allotted in\r\n\r\nrespect of sub-head 2, Urban Health Centre, on\r\n\r\npage 16 of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I wish to express\r\n\r\nobjection  to the erecting of another  $2  millions\r\n\r\nbuilding  in the vicinity of the General Hospital.\r\n\r\nI  understand  that it is to be a teaching  centre\r\n\r\nand  not for treatment, but why should it cost the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of  something  like  three   secondary\r\n\r\nschools?

It goes a bit beyond that in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  it  is  what you might call a  tripartite\r\n\r\neffort   on  the  part  of  the  Government,   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya and the City Council.

J.\r\n\r\nBraga)  in his speech on Monday went some  way  to\r\n\r\nclarify  Government policy as far as his  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  concerned but not, in our opinion, far enough.\r\n\r\nOne  question he has not yet answered is this: Why\r\n\r\ngive  priority  to  improvements  in  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital  over  the  building of  a  new  district\r\n\r\nhospital?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decentralisation is admitted to be essential,\r\n\r\nand  admitted to be part of Government policy, and\r\n\r\nyet  this  is to be delayed for the best  part  of\r\n\r\nanother  year  because money has to  be  spent  on\r\n\r\nreconditioning the General Hospital  wards  first.\r\n\r\nIs  this  absolutely necessary, and is it  in  the\r\n\r\nbest public interests?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose another question. Even if more beds\r\n\r\nwill  be  available than before in  these  General\r\n\r\nHospital wards, what will the cost be per bed, and\r\n\r\nhow  does this compare with the proposed cost  per\r\n\r\nbed at the new district hospital? I hope very much\r\n\r\nto  hear that neither the reconditioned wards nor\r\n\r\nthe  new district hospital will be built of a very\r\n\r\nhigh  standard,  nor  money lavished  on  the  new\r\n\r\nMistri  wing of the General Hospital but that  the\r\n\r\npublic is going to get very much better value  for\r\n\r\nits   money.   Nevertheless,  at   the   cost   of\r\n\r\n$3,200,000, I have my misgivings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, needs explanation because\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  Health  and  the   Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  on Monday seemed at variance with  each\r\n\r\nother.  The former explained to us that the  first\r\n\r\nsite  for  the district hospital selected  was  in\r\n\r\nKatong  and was abandoned because piling would  be\r\n\r\ntoo costly. The latter stated that work on the new\r\n\r\nsite at Kallang would be slow because the land was\r\n\r\nreclaimed land and much piling would be needed and\r\n\r\nwould take time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow  I  can readily believe that most of  the  old\r\n\r\nairfield  area is not suitable for heavy buildings\r\n\r\nbecause  of piling problems on reclaimed land  and\r\n\r\nthere  seems  to be a contradiction.  Is  the  new\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital then to cost more than  it  need\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is going to be built on an unsuitable\r\n\r\nsite?  Is a great deal of piling going to  put  up\r\n\r\nthe cost per bed of this hospital? Is the Minister\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  this is not only  the  best  site\r\n\r\ngeographically  but  also the  cheapest  from  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' point of view? I hope that hon. Members\r\n\r\nopposite will not feel that these are destructive,\r\n\r\nsterile questions. What we want is to be convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the  right decisions have been made  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  interests. If money continues to be poured\r\n\r\ninto  the General Hospital area at the expense  of\r\n\r\ndecentralisation, it is our duty to probe into the\r\n\r\nreasons for it until we get a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point I would like to mention is that\r\n\r\nunder  Head 3 this Assembly approves, among  other\r\n\r\nitems, a sum of $300,000 for a 250-bed hospital to\r\n\r\nbe  built  by  S.A.T.A. Plans for this  have  been\r\n\r\ndrawn  up by a private architect, and a charitable\r\n\r\norganisation   has   to  be  careful   of   money,\r\n\r\nespecially when it is Government money and  public\r\n\r\nmoney. Now, if a private organisation can build  a\r\n\r\n250-bed  hospital  for $300,000,  why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  approach these figures? I realise,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, that a T.B. hospital is a hospital limited\r\n\r\nto  a  single disease. It is a curative  hospital,\r\n\r\nbut  there  seems  to  me a very  great  disparity\r\n\r\nbetween  a  250-bed hospital at  $300,000  and,  I\r\n\r\nthink, a 400-bed hospital at $3,200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\ntouched at one point on the Kallang site?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Perhaps I can help him out on some\r\n\r\ntechnical  details about that one. The first  non-technical  detail, of course,  is  that  the  site\r\n\r\nthere is already Government property. We have  not\r\n\r\ngot to pay very high prices for it. In that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect, of course, the site is eminently eligible\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  free. Secondly,  it  is  eligible\r\n\r\nbecause   it   is  very  well  situated   from   a\r\n\r\ndemographic  point of view because the  population\r\n\r\naround  is both heavy and poor and it is therefore\r\n\r\na  very suitable place for a hospital to be  where\r\n\r\nthe poor people can get into it easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of piling, it is extremely hard\r\n\r\nto find any site in Singapore now where you do not\r\n\r\nhave  to put piles down and there will undoubtedly\r\n\r\nhave  to be piling, but no more than there  is  in\r\n\r\nthe   ordinary  way  with  the  majority  of   the\r\n\r\nbuildings that have to go up nowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On the question of delay in\r\n\r\nconstruction of the district hospital, I  think  I\r\n\r\nam  right  in saying that it will take a  year  to\r\n\r\nprepare  the  plans  finally before  work  can  be\r\n\r\nstarted.  In  the  meantime,  we  are  spending  a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of money on the General Hospital. I\r\n\r\nwill   deal  with  that  point  under   the   item\r\n\r\n\"Alterations to Ward, etc.\" which is going  to  be\r\n\r\nraised, I think, by the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr\r\n\r\nLim Koon Teck) very shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I cannot give the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\n(Mr  Ede) any details about the cost per bed.  He\r\n\r\nknows much more about the S.A.T.A. Hospital than I\r\n\r\ndo  myself,  but  I think it is of rather  simpler\r\n\r\nconstruction   generally  than   a   fully-fledged\r\n\r\ndistrict hospital with operating theatres and  all\r\n\r\nthe  other things like staff quarters that  go  to\r\n\r\nmake  up  a  fully-fledged district hospital.  The\r\n\r\nestimated  cost, of course, will be most carefully\r\n\r\ndrawn up. It may be that we will be able to reduce\r\n\r\nthe estimates as a result of the activities of the\r\n\r\nSub-Committee on Medical Building Costs  which  is\r\n\r\nnow  sitting. That is a matter which we will  deal\r\n\r\nwith in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the site, I think my hon. Friend the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Communications  and   Works   has\r\n\r\nexplained  that.  The first site mentioned  by  my\r\n\r\nhon.  Friend  the  Minister  for  Health  was   at\r\n\r\nKatong - a private site close to the Sea View Hotel.\r\n\r\nThat  project  was abandoned when  we  decided  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  hospital on the eastern portion  of  the\r\n\r\nKallang  Airport site. I think these are  all  the\r\n\r\npoints which have been raised by the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

In the meantime, I am  very  much\r\n\r\nconcerned  about what is going to be  done  during\r\n\r\nthe  next four years to alleviate the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  sick people in this area who have to go  down\r\n\r\nto  town  through very congested traffic.

I am\r\n\r\nreliably  informed  that the  new  Chartered  Bank\r\n\r\npremises,  Crosby House, at Anson Road costs  just\r\n\r\nover $3 millions, and if you take away the cost of\r\n\r\nthe  foundations, I think it should  be  somewhere\r\n\r\nabout what is going to be spent on the alterations\r\n\r\nto  the General Hospital, with an extension to the\r\n\r\nOrthopaedic  Unit - $2,820,000. Here is  a  complete\r\n\r\nand  concrete  building before us.

That  is an estimate  of  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nalterations which the Minister for Health  has  in\r\n\r\nmind for implementation over a number of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I can tell him what has been spent so far\r\n\r\nand what we propose to spend this year against the\r\n\r\nprovision  of $400,000 which has been  entered  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates, part of it being a revote and part\r\n\r\nof  it  being  new money. The revised estimate  of\r\n\r\ncost of work done so far is $365,000. I think  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member is familiar with the General Hospital\r\n\r\nto know what I mean when I refer to Wards 1, 2, 3,\r\n\r\n4  and 5. This money has been spent on remodelling\r\n\r\nof  Wards  1,  2,  3,  4 and  5  to  take  in  the\r\n\r\nverandahs, thus adding bed accommodation space  to\r\n\r\nthe  wards.  At  the  same  time,  new  bathrooms,\r\n\r\nlavatories  and other accommodation of  a  similar\r\n\r\nnature  have been added to make allowance for  the\r\n\r\nincreased  capacity of these wards.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  also, what is called a follow-up clinic  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  for  Professor  Monteiro's  Unit.  The\r\n\r\nobject of this follow-up clinic is to get patients\r\n\r\non  to  their  feet as soon as they can  walk  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  free beds for the occupation  of  other\r\n\r\npatients.  But  at the same time,  as  they  still\r\n\r\nrequire  treatment, facilities have to be provided\r\n\r\nfor them under the care of the same physicians who\r\n\r\nhave  been treating them before and not  to  force\r\n\r\nthem  to go to the General Outpatients Department.\r\n\r\nThat  is the object of the follow-up clinic  which\r\n\r\nhas  been provided along with the alterations  and\r\n\r\nremodelling  of  these  wards  for  the   sum   of\r\n\r\n$365,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, with the money provided, we hope to\r\n\r\nsupply  a new Ear, Nose and Throat Unit.

They have  to  use\r\n\r\nthe general operating theatres in the vicinity  of\r\n\r\nthe  consulting  room. Waiting  accommodation  for\r\n\r\noutpatients  is  not  particularly  good.  It   is\r\n\r\nproposed  to take the ward which has been  vacated\r\n\r\nby  the children who have been transferred to  the\r\n\r\nMistri  wing  and turn that into a  complete  Ear,\r\n\r\nNose  and  Throat clinic, with operating  theatres\r\n\r\nand  a  proper Outpatients Department, and so  on\r\n\r\nand  so forth. The net effect of that would be  to\r\n\r\nprovide  50  additional beds  for  Ear,  Nose  and\r\n\r\nThroat patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also at the same time to add another\r\n\r\nfloor  to  the  existing block in the  Orthopaedic\r\n\r\nsection  of  the hospital.

At the same time there will be\r\n\r\nother  minor  alterations required to provide  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  for the increased number  of  beds  in\r\n\r\nthese wards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the future, I have here a long list\r\n\r\nof  what is proposed to be done in the years from\r\n\r\n1957  onwards.

The matter  is\r\n\r\nnow under consideration and it may well be that in\r\n\r\nthe course of the next two or three months we will\r\n\r\nhave a completely revised programme which may  cut\r\n\r\ndown future plans for alterations to wards in  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital and divert the funds which  have\r\n\r\nbeen earmarked for that purpose to other purposes.\r\n\r\nI think I can say that the remarks which have come\r\n\r\nfrom the Progressive Party in this connection  are\r\n\r\nvery  constructive and helpful and they  will  be\r\n\r\nborne in mind by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  has dealt with the programme  regarding\r\n\r\nthe suggested alterations to the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a frown on the face of the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  (Mr Ede) on the question of the district\r\n\r\nhospital with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n450   beds.

Members that it is very misleading  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  hospitals in terms of the number  of  beds.\r\n\r\nOne  must  consider a hospital  in  terms  of  its\r\n\r\nfunctions. A hospital has beds and those beds must\r\n\r\nbe  used to the best possible advantage. It is not\r\n\r\na  question  of beds but an increase of facilities\r\n\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary has told you about the\r\n\r\nfloor  that we intend to expand for the Ear,  Nose\r\n\r\nand Throat Department and the Orthopaedic Unit and\r\n\r\nso  forth; and also to provide a follow-up  clinic\r\n\r\nfor  those patients who have left their beds.

They will be revised in the light of the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the Sub-Committee  on  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmedical  construction, and  it  is  possible  that\r\n\r\nconsiderable savings will be achieved on the  cost\r\n\r\nper unit of these buildings, principally, I think,\r\n\r\nby   reducing   the  standard  of  equipment   and\r\n\r\nfittings,  tiling and other things  of  a  similar\r\n\r\nnature inside the block itself.

To my mind, to spend $2,000\r\n\r\nfor  converting an existing building into one-room\r\n\r\nquarters   is  fantastic.  I  know  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  are  now  building  two-storey\r\n\r\nflats - admittedly  they  are  small - in   Guillemard\r\n\r\nRoad.  They are units by themselves and can  house\r\n\r\nat least four to five persons each. They each cost\r\n\r\n$2,300 only, and with the services, sanitation and\r\n\r\nall, I think it is $3,000, not more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you can have a complete house for $3,000,\r\n\r\nwhat justification is there for spending $2,000 to\r\n\r\nalter  one  little room - $2,000 per unit?

Sir, these are the things that make me  sit\r\n\r\nup,  and  I  think that a complete  revolution  of\r\n\r\nideas  is  necessary in the case of our  admirable\r\n\r\nP.W.D. architects - I am casting no  aspersions  on\r\n\r\nthem,  Sir,  they are friends of mine and  I  have\r\n\r\ngreat   admiration  for  them.

It\r\n\r\ndoes  take a little time to get them all  together\r\n\r\nbecause  they have bodies which have to  meet  and\r\n\r\nelect  a  particular person to serve on that  body\r\n\r\nand  that is not operating yet, but I hope it will\r\n\r\nbe operating very shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in operation two working parties - one in\r\n\r\nrespect of costs for educational buildings and one\r\n\r\nin respect of costs for medical buildings - and they\r\n\r\nare   examining   in  detail  both   the   general\r\n\r\nprinciples of building and also particular  points\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the quality of finishes and so on  which\r\n\r\nare  the  things  on which you can  probably  save\r\n\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have also increased the powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Works  Department Standing  Committee\r\n\r\nunder  which  it  can now refuse to  accept  items\r\n\r\nwhich  it  considers extravagant.  If  a  Minister\r\n\r\nthinks  he must have some item, then he will  have\r\n\r\nto  bring it to me, and if I say \"I am afraid  you\r\n\r\ncannot  have it\", then he will have to go  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers and he will have to make  out\r\n\r\na  case  for the item which he considers necessary\r\n\r\nbut  which  the  Public Works Department  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittee considers excessive. However,  this  can\r\n\r\nonly operate with regard to the future unless  you\r\n\r\nare  going to try and pull down the buildings  you\r\n\r\nhave  in the interests of economy, or tear up  the\r\n\r\nplans  or  destroy the preparations already  made.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is not much use referring  to  the\r\n\r\npast.

You will have two persons to each\r\n\r\nroom,  with  a  dining room and a kitchen  all  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  and  a little lawn in front,  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole thing costs just $300,000. Thus you have new\r\n\r\nbuildings, and added on to that you will have free\r\n\r\nland;  whereas here you are pulling down your  old\r\n\r\nhostel,  probably tearing it to pieces,  and  then\r\n\r\nreconstructing  it  at the same cost - old  building\r\n\r\nand no increase of land. You are suffering a loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Much as one likes the idea of the\r\n\r\nnurses  and  their dining rooms and  their  little\r\n\r\nlawn so that they can play badminton or have a tea-party,  one  must  remember that  the  nurses  are\r\n\r\nrequired  at the hospital and not on the  lawn  in\r\n\r\nfront  of their houses. They have to get from  the\r\n\r\nlittle lawn to the hospital, which takes a certain\r\n\r\namount of time and is also going to cost money. If\r\n\r\nthe nurses are going to have their transport paid,\r\n\r\nyou  will find that you have put up your recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  by a large sum. You can calculate  it\r\n\r\nyourself - if  you  site your  nurses  in  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden Estate or up in Thomson Road, you will  see\r\n\r\nwhat  the cost would be, assuming, of course, that\r\n\r\nby  that  time the transport strikes are over  and\r\n\r\nthe  nurses are able to get a bus. If not, you can\r\n\r\ncalculate  what  it would cost to come  by  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxi  or  what  it would cost you if you  provided\r\n\r\nthem  all with cars. I do not think, in fact,  you\r\n\r\ncan  arrive  at any permanent saving by dispersing\r\n\r\nyour  hospital staff all over the island in remote\r\n\r\nlittle building estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I think the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works is confusing  the  issue.\r\n\r\nHe  is bringing his class-room theories into  this\r\n\r\ndebate.

Surely  the Member for Paya  Lebar  does\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  if  you  are  going  to  have  a\r\n\r\nhospital,  it  should be sited in  the  centre  of\r\n\r\npopulation;  land in the centre of  population  is\r\n\r\nscarce,  and you cannot therefore build a  lot  of\r\n\r\nsmall  houses with vacant land around them.  In  a\r\n\r\nsite  where there is no land, you have to build  a\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  hospital of the type where  you  can\r\n\r\nhouse  a  lot  of  people in  a  small  area.  The\r\n\r\nalternative  is  to build your  hospital  in  some\r\n\r\nplace  where  there  is  no  population,  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, you will still be unhappy because the sick\r\n\r\npeople  have to travel a long way to  get  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital. There is really no simple answer to  it.\r\n\r\nThe  thing is that you must have your nurses  near\r\n\r\nyour  hospital as a practical necessity.  You  may\r\n\r\nhave some living out, of course, but you must have\r\n\r\nyour  hospital in a populated area where it serves\r\n\r\nthe  population and consequently you must build  a\r\n\r\nmulti-storey type of structure normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> The Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works is so concerned about his\r\n\r\nnurses that he cannot think away from his hospital\r\n\r\nand  his nurses.

I admit that I have built a hundred\r\n\r\nodd houses in Singapore. They range from $6,000 to\r\n\r\n$12,000 and they have been all sold. I have worked\r\n\r\non  a  return of 6 per cent, which is  the  actual\r\n\r\nrate that we have to pay the bank for interest.  I\r\n\r\nhave  also designed low-cost housing which can  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  for  $3,000 on swamp land, which I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister has seen and admired.\r\n\r\nI  have  also during my election days - call  it  an\r\n\r\nelection stunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  you  like - helped  to build  a  five  classroom\r\n\r\nschool for $15,000 on swampy land. I hesitated  to\r\n\r\ntell that to any of the Ministers, but now that  I\r\n\r\nhave  my  position clear that I am not making  any\r\n\r\nprofit out of this, I can show it to them. Anybody\r\n\r\ncan have my plans and my ideas, but do not ask  me\r\n\r\nto  build  them as I prefer not to do any low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing. I can now speak with a clear conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here we have an item of $4 millions for\r\n\r\nquarters  for  Government officers.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nrevised  from  an estimate of $3 millions,  and  I\r\n\r\nshall have to ask why this increase has been made.\r\n\r\nI   admit  that  since  the  introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nProvident Fund and the strikes, costs have gone up\r\n\r\nabout  5 per cent but not to the extent of 25  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, another point I wish to make is that I do\r\n\r\nnot think it is necessary today to provide housing\r\n\r\nfor  Division I or Division II senior officers.  I\r\n\r\nnotice in the Estimates that the cost for each  of\r\n\r\nthese officers comes to about $45,000 for quarters\r\n\r\nand  about  $35,000 for flats. It has come  to  my\r\n\r\nknowledge   that  future  senior   officers,   who\r\n\r\nundoubtedly due to the Malayanisation scheme  will\r\n\r\nbe  Malayan  officers and who will be using  these\r\n\r\nquarters, would prefer, if possible, to buy  their\r\n\r\nown  homes  on the hire-purchase system helped  by\r\n\r\nthe  allowance  which  they are  getting  for  not\r\n\r\nhaving Government quarters, and I think this is  a\r\n\r\nvery  sensible plan. Why lock up all this  capital\r\n\r\non  something which the Government servants prefer\r\n\r\nto  own  themselves? If he buys one house now  and\r\n\r\npays on instalments, the house will be his in  ten\r\n\r\nyears  time,  and when he retires he will  have  a\r\n\r\nroof over his head. What I do maintain is that all\r\n\r\nthe  money that can be saved from the quarters for\r\n\r\nthis  class  of officers should be  spent  on  the\r\n\r\nlower income group many of whom unfortunately will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to buy their own homes, no matter how\r\n\r\ncheap  they are, unless Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\nallow them to buy without payment of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> In the 1955 Estimates, Sir, $3\r\n\r\nmillions  was  entered  as the  cost  of  building\r\n\r\nquarters for Government officers, and I think  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of  that year said $1.55  millions  had\r\n\r\nbeen spent, another $700,000 had been provided and\r\n\r\n$500,000  was revoted. In 1956 the cost  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $4 millions and the figure  in  the\r\n\r\n\"Amount  estimated  to be spent\"  column  is  $2.2\r\n\r\nmillions. The figure in the \"New Provision\" column\r\n\r\nis  $1  million, and in the second last column  of\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates  you  have  $750,000  required   to\r\n\r\ncomplete.  Since  the start  of  the  scheme,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing quarters have been built:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  10 quarters have been built in Mount Pleasant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  3 blocks  of  flats  have been built  in  Leonie\r\n\r\n    Hill; that is 30 quarters altogether:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  2 more  blocks  of  flats, that is,  another  20\r\n\r\n    quarters,   are  being  constructed   at   the\r\n\r\n    moment.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br>Of  the  $1  million provided  this  year,  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated  that  $750,000  will  be  required   to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the two blocks of flats which  are  now\r\n\r\nunder  construction. That will leave  $250,000  to\r\n\r\nmake  a start, as was intended, on a further block\r\n\r\nof  flats  for  senior officers,  there  being  at\r\n\r\npresent  approximately 30 officers on the  waiting\r\n\r\nlist  for houses. 23 officers are living in rented\r\n\r\nquarters,  the  rents being paid from  the  Rental\r\n\r\nVote,   and   16   bachelors   are   without   any\r\n\r\naccommodation  at all. Now, that waiting  list  is\r\n\r\nthe  justification  for this additional  block  of\r\n\r\nflats,  which  we did envisage. If,  however,  the\r\n\r\nresult   of   the  Report  of  the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nCommission  necessitates a revision of our  plans,\r\n\r\nthen,  of  course,  we will undertake  a  revision\r\n\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the $1 million provision made this year,\r\n\r\n$750,000,  as far as we can estimate, is  required\r\n\r\nto  complete  work in hand at the moment  and  the\r\n\r\nother $250,000 is a possible saving, having regard\r\n\r\nto   the   result   of   the   findings   of   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There are one or two points that\r\n\r\nmight be usefully added to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  excellent  summary  of  my  hon.  Friend  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary. In view of the expectation of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation, these new quarters are being built\r\n\r\nwith  provision for three bedrooms on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  when local officers inhabit them,  they  are\r\n\r\nvery  likely  to have more dependants because  the\r\n\r\nsenior  expatriate  officer  tends  to  have   his\r\n\r\nchildren  overseas or his wife overseas  and  does\r\n\r\nnot  have the same need for bedrooms as a man  who\r\n\r\nmay  possibly  have his father and his  mother  or\r\n\r\nother  relatives, or perhaps a larger family  than\r\n\r\nexpatriate officers manage to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised about people owning their own\r\n\r\nquarters  or houses is an interesting one,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould   point  out  that  there  is  no   absolute\r\n\r\nimpossibility  for a man to own a flat.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis question is under consideration and if in the\r\n\r\nfuture the officers say, \"We would like to own our\r\n\r\naccommodation  instead of just living  in  it,  so\r\n\r\nthat when we retire we can continue to live in the\r\n\r\nsame  flat\",  I  have no doubt that this  Assembly\r\n\r\ncould  discuss it and make it possible for  people\r\n\r\nto buy a flat in a block if they want to. There is\r\n\r\nalso  this point, that if you are going to scatter\r\n\r\nyour  Government servants all over the  island  in\r\n\r\nprivately-owned houses, you do by that reduce  the\r\n\r\namount  of  available sites for the non-Government\r\n\r\nbuilders  and  the private citizen. It  is  highly\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  economise  on  space  as  much   as\r\n\r\npossible  because  ordinary  citizens  cannot  get\r\n\r\ntogether into a kongsi and build a block of flats.\r\n\r\nWhen  one  man buys one house, the State buildings\r\n\r\nwill  cover lots of extra ground, for each  is  in\r\n\r\neffect  one section of a flat building and  it  is\r\n\r\nlying  on the ground instead of being on a  fourth\r\n\r\nstorey.  A  private citizen has to  work  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis.  The Government has the financial resources\r\n\r\nand the planning ability to provide multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nbuildings  in  which  a  lot  of  people  can  get\r\n\r\naccommodation,  and there is a  definite  economic\r\n\r\nadvantage to the territory as a whole if  you  can\r\n\r\nreduce  the pressure on building sites  by  having\r\n\r\nmulti-storeyed accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the points I have raised  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  considered  by  Government  I  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

That\r\n\r\nword   is   \"Development\".  I  take  it  that   by\r\n\r\n\"improvements\", it means the making of an  already\r\n\r\ngood thing look better?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sixty years of my life, I have covered\r\n\r\nalmost  every piece of Crown land in  my  and  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  districts. I have so far  never  come\r\n\r\nacross  any  work  done which  can  be  called  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  to any Crown land. I wonder  what  is\r\n\r\nthere  to be improved on any Crown land. If  I  am\r\n\r\nnot mistaken, I think every piece of Crown land is\r\n\r\nbeing  rented out and if improvement is needed  on\r\n\r\nthe  Crown land, that should be the responsibility\r\n\r\nof   the   tenant  or  the  licensee.  Why  should\r\n\r\nGovernment \"carry the baby\"? So I would  like  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Communications and Works  to\r\n\r\ngive the House an explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I rise, Mr Chairman, Sir, with my\r\n\r\nface  extremely  red to confess that,  by  a  slip\r\n\r\nrather  similar  to that by which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) earlier yesterday\r\n\r\nconfused  an Executive Engineer with an Electrical\r\n\r\nEngineer,  I  confused earlier today \"Improvements\r\n\r\nto Crown Lands\" with \"Minor Works Unforeseen\" and I\r\n\r\nam afraid I gave to the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Koon  Teck) the answer which should now  have\r\n\r\nbeen given to the Member for Changi -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> You have not done your\r\n\r\nhomework!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It was purely a matter of\r\n\r\ninattention.

If he wants the information  which\r\n\r\nI should have given him if I had been on the spot,\r\n\r\nhe  is  very  welcome to it.

I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned this morning that we have there  a\r\n\r\nlarge civil defence area and some of the ground is\r\n\r\nstill  swampy and not, in fact, serviceable  until\r\n\r\nit has been filled up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this provision will enable us to fill it\r\n\r\nup.  Also you have to fill up areas where you want\r\n\r\ntime  for  the earth to settle. You do  not  build\r\n\r\nimmediately  you  fill. You have  got  to  let  it\r\n\r\nconsolidate and then you will have another look at\r\n\r\nit to see if you want to put in some more perhaps.\r\n\r\nBefore  the building programme can start, you  may\r\n\r\nhave  to fill up for a considerable period beforehand  in  order to make sure that your  earth  has\r\n\r\nconsolidated before you put in anything on top. It\r\n\r\nis  not  for  large schemes but for  comparatively\r\n\r\nsmall  works where there are no appropriate  funds\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  I  can go on with more detail  if  you\r\n\r\nlike.

I quite agree that we\r\n\r\nshould  upkeep our public buildings  in  a  manner\r\n\r\nthat  would reflect the dignity of Singapore,  but\r\n\r\ninstead  of  spending such a huge sum  on  an  old\r\n\r\nbuilding just to give it a facelift, I think it is\r\n\r\nbetter  that we spend this amount to build one  or\r\n\r\ntwo schools. We are told that we are very short of\r\n\r\nschools,  and  to  build  schools  we  must   have\r\n\r\nsufficient funds.

I  am  of   the\r\n\r\nopinion,  Sir,  that  this area  is  one  occupied\r\n\r\nmainly  by the upper bracket of the civil service.\r\n\r\nI  am also of the opinion that the people involved\r\n\r\nare not many. In fact, I think they are fewer than\r\n\r\nin  other areas that have similar claims, so  that\r\n\r\nif  we  think  that  we are  going  to  give  such\r\n\r\namenities to people in the higher bracket, then we\r\n\r\nmust  also  think of people who are in  the  lower\r\n\r\nbracket. They are more numerous in number and such\r\n\r\nsums  of money will be put to better use when many\r\n\r\npeople  share it. The operative word  now  is  not\r\n\r\njust \"services\" but \"service to the largest number\r\n\r\nof people involved\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the Government is informing the House\r\n\r\nthat  it  is because we are to change the lighting\r\n\r\nfrom  gas  to electricity, then I think  that  can\r\n\r\nwait because it is not necessary. In fact, if  you\r\n\r\ntake  away  one  service by turning  off  the  gas\r\n\r\nsupply,  then  must you immediately  turn  on  the\r\n\r\nelectrical  supply?  Any  improvement  to   street\r\n\r\nlighting should be considered also in the light of\r\n\r\ntraffic accidents. That area, I believe, is not  a\r\n\r\nmain  thoroughfare.  You do  not  have  many  cars\r\n\r\ngetting  in  and out. Again, that area  is  not  a\r\n\r\nplace whereby people go on foot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  on  bicycle late at night, and, as  far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow, whatever transport they use would be cars of\r\n\r\ntheir  own, and if not cars of their own, at least\r\n\r\ntaxis.  Now, I suggest you shift to another area - I\r\n\r\nthink  you  can find another area - where  you  will\r\n\r\nprobably  find more people on foot or  on  bicycle\r\n\r\nlate  at  night and where the traffic is  heavier.\r\n\r\nThen,  in  that  case, that claim for  improvement\r\n\r\nwould  be  more justified. I would  like  to  hear\r\n\r\nfurther  what the Government have to say  on  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Government has an obligation to\r\n\r\nprovide   street  lighting  in  the  areas   where\r\n\r\nGovernment quarters are.

By arrangement with  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council, however, we have agreed  with  them\r\n\r\nthat  the  gas supply will remain in  being  until\r\n\r\nsuch time as we can replace it and until such time\r\n\r\nas we can put money in the Estimates to replace it\r\n\r\nwith  electricity.  That is the  reason  for  this\r\n\r\nvote.  To  leave Goodwood Hill unlit, we would  be\r\n\r\nfailing  in responsibility in respect of areas  in\r\n\r\nwhich Government quarters are situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I remember, too, that\r\n\r\nthere is another area which is probably lighted by\r\n\r\ngas - McNair  Road.

If that is so, I would\r\n\r\nsuggest that it would be far more to the advantage\r\n\r\nof  the Government to have these appliances  hired\r\n\r\nfrom  the  City  Council. From  my  own  practical\r\n\r\nexperience, I feel that it is far more  economical\r\n\r\nto hire such appliances rather than purchase them,\r\n\r\nand I will quote an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum price for an electric fan would cost\r\n\r\n$120.   It   would  cost  another  $40   for   the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  this fan, which  makes  a  total\r\n\r\nvalue of $160. The maximum life of this fan would,\r\n\r\nI  presume, be ten years, which makes $160 divided\r\n\r\nby  ten  which is $16 per year. Now, I have worked\r\n\r\nit  out  on  this $16 that it would be cheaper  to\r\n\r\nhire  a fan from the City Council because it would\r\n\r\ncost  only $1, whereas it costs roughly $1.50  for\r\n\r\nthe  purchase  of this fan. Apart from  the  money\r\n\r\nsaved, I think it is a good gesture on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to co-operate and  support  the\r\n\r\nCity Council to help them push their appliances so\r\n\r\nthat  more could be used by consumers. I must make\r\n\r\nit  clear  that I am not speaking here as  a  City\r\n\r\nCouncillor, because I have no interest in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  at  all except as a Member  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  I  am speaking here in the interests  of\r\n\r\neconomy so that Government can save more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I could not agree more with the\r\n\r\nremarks of the hon.

They seem to me to  be\r\n\r\nright  on  the beam, but unfortunately he  himself\r\n\r\nand  the  other personalities of the City  Council\r\n\r\nare the persons to blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that the Government buys electric\r\n\r\ncurrent  at bulk rates from the City Council.  The\r\n\r\nrate,  I  think, is six cents per unit as  against\r\n\r\n17\u00bd  cents that the public pay. Consequently,  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council says, \"I am selling this in bulk  to\r\n\r\nyou  and  I  am not going to give you any  service\r\n\r\nwith it. If you want meters for individual houses,\r\n\r\nyou  have to buy your own meters. If you  want  to\r\n\r\nhave  fans,  you have to provide your  own  fans.\"\r\n\r\nThey  will  not, in fact, rent us  their  fans  or\r\n\r\ntheir  cookers or their refrigerators or  whatever\r\n\r\nit is that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant to rent. They refuse to let us have them, and\r\n\r\nI wish that the hon. Member could convince them - it\r\n\r\nis  now rather too late, I am afraid. That is  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  that these appliances  are  not  being\r\n\r\nbought to donate to Government quarters. They will\r\n\r\nbe  treated  in the same way as the  City  Council\r\n\r\nappliances  are.  They will be hired  out  to  the\r\n\r\noccupants  and  the  money,  in  fact,   will   be\r\n\r\nrecoverable.   It  is,  in  short,  a   commercial\r\n\r\ntransaction  which the Government is carrying  out\r\n\r\non  a small scale as compared to the big scale  in\r\n\r\nwhich   the   City  Council  operates   the   same\r\n\r\nprovisions.

As far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow,  the  City  Council is trying  to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to hire such appliances.

Under that Head, I look at item\r\n\r\n6 - Youth  Holiday Camps. The estimated cost  I  can\r\n\r\nsee  here  is $200,000 but the total allocated  is\r\n\r\n$10.  I  would  like an assurance from  Government\r\n\r\nthat Youth Holiday Camps are important. So far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned, we can only boast of:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n 1. The Tanah Merah Youth Camp.\r\n\r\n 2. The Lim Chu Kang Boy Scouts Camp.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, you consider the number of boys and\r\n\r\ngirls who would like to go out camping but who  do\r\n\r\nnot belong to any organised movement, then you can\r\n\r\nsee  that the need is very real. I consider  that,\r\n\r\nfor  the  health  of  the coming  generation,  for\r\n\r\ndeveloping  a  sense of co-operation amongst  them\r\n\r\nand  developing  their ability to organise  things\r\n\r\nthemselves, youth camps should be dotted all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore and where you can, by the sea,  so  that\r\n\r\nit will serve as an added amenity to youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On item 2 - Community Centres - we are budgeting for\r\n\r\nthree  at $450,000 and a token vote of $10 is  put\r\n\r\ndown.  Community  centres,  I  believe,  would  be\r\n\r\nhelpful   to   a  community  that  is  well-welded\r\n\r\ntogether,  but  from what I can  see  of  so  many\r\n\r\ncentres, a great deal more work has to be done.  A\r\n\r\nstart   must   be   made  to   develop   community\r\n\r\nconsciousness amongst groups of people staying  in\r\n\r\nspecified  areas.  Usually, the centres  built  by\r\n\r\nGovernment are far away from such habitations  and\r\n\r\npeople  do not find it convenient to make  use  of\r\n\r\nthem.  I  would  like  the  Government  rather  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the feasibility not of building  centres\r\n\r\nall on its own but of making small grants of, say,\r\n\r\nbetween  $10,000 and $20,000 to assist communities\r\n\r\nto build their own centres. In that manner, when a\r\n\r\ncommunity works for the building of that centre, I\r\n\r\nbelieve they will be proud of it and they will run\r\n\r\nit even more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, at\r\n\r\nyesterday's  sitting I gave an  assurance  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon that youth welfare is in  the\r\n\r\nfore in the Government's programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the point raised by the hon.

At\r\n\r\nno  time during these eight years, Sir, has a more\r\n\r\nfavourable  moment  been  reached  to  discuss   a\r\n\r\npeaceful settlement of the Emergency than now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three strong forces today in\r\n\r\nMalaya - Colonialism,  Communism,  and  Nationalism.\r\n\r\nThe  first two are supported by armed forces.  The\r\n\r\nBritish  have  the  Army, the Navy,  and  the  Air\r\n\r\nForce.  The  Communists have what they call  their\r\n\r\nMalayan   People's  Liberation  Army.   Only   the\r\n\r\nnationalists have no armies or other armed  might.\r\n\r\nThe  British are supported by all those  who  have\r\n\r\nmade comfortable niches for themselves within  the\r\n\r\nexisting colonial system - people who fear a  sudden\r\n\r\nchange  because  it might upset their  comfortable\r\n\r\nhomes,  their  comfortable  businesses  and  their\r\n\r\ncomfortable lives. The Communists have the support\r\n\r\nof  a good number of squatters and labourers,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have working amongst these masses,  men  who\r\n\r\nbelieve that Communism is the answer to the social\r\n\r\nand economic ills of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the large mass of the people of this country\r\n\r\nare  nationalists.  They have  learnt  to  hate  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  Malaya because it has degraded them  and\r\n\r\nlost  them  their self-respect. It has  not  given\r\n\r\nthem  a  world  in which they can  live  as  self-respecting human beings in a peaceful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand happy society, where the wealth of the country\r\n\r\nis  developed for the benefit of the people of the\r\n\r\ncountry and not for the benefit of those who,  for\r\n\r\nreasons  of  military might, have taken  political\r\n\r\ncontrol  of this territory. Unlike the Communists,\r\n\r\nthis  large group has no fixed, definite ideas  of\r\n\r\nwhat  they want to do with an independent  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThey are large amorphous forces. Some believe that\r\n\r\nthe  answer lies in a militant Malayan nationalism\r\n\r\naround which they can rally all the forces in this\r\n\r\ncountry -  the masses that we have heard spoken  of\r\n\r\nso  often  even in this Assembly. Most respectable\r\n\r\nand  conservative Members have, all of  a  sudden,\r\n\r\ncome  to  realise that it is the masses  who  will\r\n\r\ndecide  whether this country survives,  after  the\r\n\r\nperiod   of   colonial  rule  is   over,   as   an\r\n\r\nindependent, democratic Malaya, or as a  Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Some  favour  a  broadly-based  Socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya, democratic and tolerant of other political\r\n\r\nideals and political ideas, based somewhat on  the\r\n\r\nIndian  Nationalist  movement  which  solved   the\r\n\r\ncolonial problems in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last eight years, the armed fight\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism has been led by  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party. In that fight, the British  have\r\n\r\ntried  to  rally the people on what they call  the\r\n\r\nside  of  law and order. Successive Generals  have\r\n\r\nalways said that if only they could get the people\r\n\r\nto  give  them  information and help,  they  could\r\n\r\nsquash this Emergency in a matter of months.  They\r\n\r\nhave  not  squashed this Emergency in a matter  of\r\n\r\neight years. So long as the people feel that  this\r\n\r\nis  not  their war, that this is a fight, not  for\r\n\r\nthem  but  for colonialism, they will not  lift  a\r\n\r\nfinger.   Even  if  there  were  no   threat,   no\r\n\r\nintimidation,  no reprisals from  the  Communists,\r\n\r\nthey  would  still not bestir themselves  for  one\r\n\r\nside  or  the other, because most ordinary  people\r\n\r\nlike  to  play safe. Even in this little Assembly,\r\n\r\nwe  see  so very often, when decisions are  taken,\r\n\r\nhow  Members in this Assembly play safe, and  most\r\n\r\nof the people in Malaya are that way inclined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have reached the crossroads. A phase\r\n\r\nhas passed or is passing. There is a stalemate  in\r\n\r\nthis war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Communists  cannot establish their  Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  The  British have declared no  fixed  and\r\n\r\ndefinite  policy.  They have vaguely  referred  to\r\n\r\ntheir  intentions  of  self-government  ultimately\r\n\r\nwithin  the  British  Commonwealth.  It  has   not\r\n\r\ncaptured  anybody's imagination. Nobody  has  been\r\n\r\nstirred  by  these  words.  The  position  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional field is very fluid, more fluid  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  than  it  is  in  the  Federation.  The\r\n\r\ndifference, however, is not as great as one  would\r\n\r\nimagine   if   one  just  compared  the   external\r\n\r\nmanifestations  in the last few months  after  the\r\n\r\nelections. Singapore has gone through a period  of\r\n\r\nstress, turmoil,  strikes  and   lockouts.   The\r\n\r\nFederation has been relatively calm. This may lead\r\n\r\nsome  people  to  believe that conditions  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are  completely different  from  those\r\n\r\nexisting  in  Singapore. I find  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nsubscribe to this view, for the simple reason that\r\n\r\nif  the  basic  discontents were  not  there,  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party could not have  survived.\r\n\r\nThe  basic  conditions  for  discontent  have  not\r\n\r\nmanifested  themselves openly in  civil  commotion\r\n\r\nbecause  of  military  suppression  and   a   more\r\n\r\nmilitant armed administration. But, I believe  the\r\n\r\nFederation is by and large in the same position as\r\n\r\nthe Colony of Singapore, with this one difference.\r\n\r\nThe  ratio of population between the native  races\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the Federation perhaps makes the\r\n\r\nbalance  in the Federation more in favour of  slow\r\n\r\nprogress - not     revolutionary    progress     but\r\n\r\nevolutionary - because, by and  large,  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman   and   large,   U.M.N.O. movement   have\r\n\r\ninculcated,  or perhaps they have just  expressed,\r\n\r\nthe   innate   inclinations  of  the  Malays   for\r\n\r\nevolutionary progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists, on the other hand, realise that\r\n\r\nthe  internal  and international position  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  has  changed since Geneva. The  theme  is\r\n\r\npeaceful co-existence. Since Bandung, the emphasis\r\n\r\nin South-East Asia has been peaceful co-existence.\r\n\r\nNo  one  wants to precipitate a third  world  war.\r\n\r\nEveryone  wants time to consolidate, perhaps  for\r\n\r\npeace, perhaps for some\r\n\r\neventual conflict which might burn up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  whole world. That is beyond us and we  cannot\r\n\r\nworry  ourselves  with that. But  it  affects  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Malayan Communist Party in  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot completely ignore the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nline  today throughout the whole world is peaceful\r\n\r\nco-existence,  not the existence  of  one  to  the\r\n\r\nexclusion of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaya, with the elections in April in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  in  July in  the  Federation,  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional field entered into a new  phase.  For\r\n\r\nthe  first time, there were wide popular elections\r\n\r\nwhich  has  thrown up in its first flush  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal   of   wild,   irresponsible  talk - and   this\r\n\r\nparticularly  from  the business  communities - that\r\n\r\nthe country is going to pieces and that the people\r\n\r\nare  not  ready for this independence even  in  an\r\n\r\nattenuated  version and that, in  fact,  it  would\r\n\r\nonly  lead to chaos. But it has opened up a  phase\r\n\r\nwhich the Communists cannot ignore. It means  that\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional  struggle  may  yield  further\r\n\r\nresults.  It  means that if an armed  conflict  is\r\n\r\npersisted  in  willy-nilly,  regardless   of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional position and the political  parties\r\n\r\nrepresenting the people constitutionally,  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult position may arise for them at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage.  Hence, at a dramatic moment  on  May  1st,\r\n\r\nLabour Day, the first peace offer was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to those of us who have not faced this\r\n\r\nproblem as closely and as acutely as I have  faced\r\n\r\nit - and  I have faced it because I have not  wasted\r\n\r\nmy  time  talking about footling things and  doing\r\n\r\nthe  silly  things  which some  political  parties\r\n\r\nwhich  existed in the period of the vacuum between\r\n\r\n1948  and  1954  did - it is an  enormous  problem.\r\n\r\nEnormous because in Malaya, Communism came  before\r\n\r\nnationalism.  Enormous because  in  those  32  odd\r\n\r\nyears    since   the   Malayan   Communist   Party\r\n\r\nestablished  itself  in Malaya,  it  has  actively\r\n\r\npreached  its  philosophy  as  an  answer  to  the\r\n\r\npolitical, economic and social injustices of which\r\n\r\nthere  were plenty, and of which there  are  still\r\n\r\nplenty  in  Malaya. The large mass of the  people,\r\n\r\nalthough  they hate the political injustices,  the\r\n\r\npoverty, the social and economic injustices are ap-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprehensive of the rigours and the discipline which\r\n\r\na  Communist Malaya would impose. But if they  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the alternative of a continuation  of\r\n\r\nthe  colonial system, however streamlined,  and  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  Malaya, which is going to be  effective\r\n\r\nand honest even if it is rigid and disciplined and\r\n\r\nilliberal, I fear that a large mass of the people,\r\n\r\nwho  have  not  the time to bother  about  liberal\r\n\r\nconcepts of the freedom of the individual - liberty,\r\n\r\nfreedom  from arrest without trial, the  right  of\r\n\r\nfree  speech - because they are too preoccupied with\r\n\r\nmaking a living, would choose Communism. For them,\r\n\r\nit   does   not  matter  what  it  is.  Communism,\r\n\r\nNationalism, and Fascism mean nothing to the  vast\r\n\r\nmasses  who  are in such a state of  poverty  that\r\n\r\nnothing  makes any meaning except more food,  more\r\n\r\nclothes, a house and a better life. It is in  that\r\n\r\nperspective, that the problem of the Emergency  is\r\n\r\nnot  one  of  shooting and killing a few  thousand\r\n\r\nCommunists that I speak on my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chief Minister, despite his faults, is not an\r\n\r\nunintelligent man. In fact, no less a person  than\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies  has\r\n\r\nproclaimed  him  a highly intelligent  individual!\r\n\r\nAnd  I  must  be careful not to differ  from  that\r\n\r\nopinion.  I think he realises today, what  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  realise  at  the time when he  first  entered\r\n\r\npolitics,  and  when  he first  became  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, that the problem is not just a  question\r\n\r\nof passing legislation - 44-hour working week to 42-hour  working week to 40-hour working week; fixing\r\n\r\na minimum wage; making speeches to trade unions at\r\n\r\ntrade  union  rallies.  The  problem  is  one   of\r\n\r\nconvincing  the  people that a particular  way  of\r\n\r\nlife  can not only bring economic relief  but  can\r\n\r\nalso introduce into the country a liberal form  of\r\n\r\nhuman  society which we believe we should  try  to\r\n\r\nestablish in this country. But where I differ from\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister is that he  believes\r\n\r\nthat Communism is absolutely evil - he hates it,  he\r\n\r\nhates  every aspect of it, and he would fight  it.\r\n\r\nHe  would  support colonialism; he  would  support\r\n\r\ncapitalism;  he  would support anything  to  fight\r\n\r\nCommunism. I do not support that view because I do\r\n\r\nnot believe that it is a simple question of black\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  white.  I  have  been a  bit  longer  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical milieu of the country than the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, and I can claim  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand,  perhaps more than he can,  the  other\r\n\r\npoint  of  view - the point of view of a  man  or  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  men in this society completely excluded\r\n\r\nfrom   the  system - bitter  and  hostile,   feeling\r\n\r\nemotionally  hostile enough to engage  in  violent\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Hon. the Chief Minister spoke of this\r\n\r\nlovely  island  of  ours and  when  the  hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nSutherland  was quick to interject and  remind  us\r\n\r\nthat  it is all man-made, I often wondered if they\r\n\r\nwould  say  it was a lovely island if they  had  a\r\n\r\nlittle  shanty of a shack in Trafalgar Street,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the Hon. the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing has often gone  with  me.  One\r\n\r\nlittle  room  for bedroom, an outdoor  kitchen,  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  bathroom. There one lives, eats,  sleeps\r\n\r\nand dies - in filth and in squalor. They work in the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board, which supplies them  with\r\n\r\nelectricity  at  night, and  sometimes  on  public\r\n\r\nholidays  in  the  day-time.  When  there  is   no\r\n\r\nelectricity  on  a public holiday like  Deepavali,\r\n\r\nthey look for their elected representative to make\r\n\r\nrepresentations to get electricity for them. Those\r\n\r\nare  the  small mercies they look for out of  this\r\n\r\nconstitution. The Minister for Housing and I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  down  there together many a  time  and  have\r\n\r\nlooked   at  the  higgledy-piggledy  houses,   the\r\n\r\nbarracks, the squalor, the slum. We give them  our\r\n\r\nsympathy, we make promises, but nothing  has  been\r\n\r\ndone  and  nothing is likely to  be  done  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming  year. There is no provision for it in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  And we are asking them to  believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy, to believe that the process of  putting\r\n\r\na  mark  on  a  piece of ballot paper  within  the\r\n\r\nconstitution of this Colony can bring  relief.  It\r\n\r\nis  because I understand that side of the  problem\r\n\r\nthat  I  do  not  agree with the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister in his violently anti-Communist stand.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  in  all  honesty say that Communism  is  a\r\n\r\ndiabolical  evil,  because I can  imagine  certain\r\n\r\nhuman societies where it was a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  relief  to have the Communists  displace  a\r\n\r\nruling   power.  That  is  another  of  the   very\r\n\r\ndifficult  problems we face in  this  country.  To\r\n\r\nsome 600 million Chinese, that philosophy was  the\r\n\r\nanswer  and is the answer to a decadent, a corrupt\r\n\r\nand  an evil society which has become evil because\r\n\r\nmen  have  lost their self-respect and lost  their\r\n\r\nvalues.  But  I do not believe however  that  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  see in Malaya a similar dictatorship  of\r\n\r\nthe  proletariat or dictatorship of the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty. If I did believe that, then perhaps I would\r\n\r\nretire  from politics and go and plant vegetables,\r\n\r\nfor that would be the most innocuous thing that  I\r\n\r\nwould  do  in a Communist Malaya. But at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  as long as the fight in Malaya is a  three-cornered one between the British, the Nationalists\r\n\r\nand  the  Communists, there is with every  passing\r\n\r\nday, a drift away from an independent, democratic,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  Malaya.  Sometimes  people  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  what I say because they do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nbelieve it, because they do not want to be  shaken\r\n\r\nout  of  their  complacency  and  the  comfortable\r\n\r\nlittle  niches  they have made for  themselves  in\r\n\r\nthis society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible at any peace talks to take\r\n\r\nthe  line  that  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\ntaken - that if we have Communism in Malaya, then we\r\n\r\nshall die; that we live because we are part of the\r\n\r\nfree  world;  that  we live because  we  sell  our\r\n\r\nservice  to the free world; that if the Communists\r\n\r\ntake  over,  we  will  die  and  we  will  starve.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he appeals to their sense of logic  and\r\n\r\ndecency,  that they should not take over and  that\r\n\r\nthey should all pack up and go back to China,  and\r\n\r\nthose  of them who do not wish to go back to China\r\n\r\ncan   be  detained  in  some  rehabilitation   and\r\n\r\ncorrective training camp. I do not think those who\r\n\r\nhave  spent  eight  years, nine  years,  sometimes\r\n\r\nmore,  as anonymous revolutionaries, giving  their\r\n\r\nlives,  dedicating it to a revolution  which  they\r\n\r\nbelieve is the answer to the evils of our society,\r\n\r\ncan  be  persuaded to believe that  it  will  kill\r\n\r\nSingapore. I do not think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  could  reach  a settlement with  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party if one postulates for  all  time,\r\n\r\n\"You can never take part in the political life  of\r\n\r\nthis country. You can never preach your creed. You\r\n\r\nare  forever  proscribed.\" A  settlement  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis can never be reached. I may be wrong, but  I\r\n\r\ndo  believe that a settlement could be reached  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  immediate object  of  an  independent,\r\n\r\ndemocratic,   non-Communist   Malaya   could    be\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one can say for all time\r\n\r\nthat Malaya is to be Communist, anti-Communist, or\r\n\r\nnon-Communist. No one would be foolish  enough  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  The future is determined by many  factors\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control. There are three  factors  in\r\n\r\nthis  political  set-up - political,  economic   and\r\n\r\nsocial. The political urge in postwar Malaya is to\r\n\r\nget  rid  of  the British; to get rid  of  foreign\r\n\r\nrule, in any shape, in any form; to get rid of any\r\n\r\nreminder, any of the trappings that remind us that\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  subject race, that remind us that  the\r\n\r\nlast  word is with the British Government, through\r\n\r\nits  government, through its civil  servants,  not\r\n\r\nthrough   the  people's  elected  representatives.\r\n\r\nThese  were  the  three urges in India,  Pakistan,\r\n\r\nCeylon,  Indonesia, and Burma. They have satisfied\r\n\r\nthe  first urge - the political urge. They have  got\r\n\r\nrid  of  their foreign master and they are masters\r\n\r\nin  their  own homes. They now face the other  two\r\n\r\nurges - economic and social - poverty and  the  social\r\n\r\ninjustices of their own society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Communist parties in every one of these\r\n\r\nterritories.  It  is  because  Communism  is   the\r\n\r\nproduct  of social and economic circumstances.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  solution which appeals to those who want  a\r\n\r\nswift  and  radical  change  from  poverty,   from\r\n\r\nmisery, from social injustices. And it has worked.\r\n\r\nIt may yet work in South-East Asia - we do not know.\r\n\r\nBut it will definitely take over if India fails as\r\n\r\na  democracy,  if Burma fails as a  democracy,  if\r\n\r\nIndonesia fails as a democracy. People lose  faith\r\n\r\nin political movements and politi-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncal philosophies  which\r\n\r\ntalk but do not produce results. Then nothing, not\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. nor the hydrogen bomb can prevent  the\r\n\r\nIndian   people,  the  Indonesian  people,  freely\r\n\r\nchoosing - as  seven  odd million  Indonesians  have\r\n\r\nalready  freely  chosen - on the  ballot  paper  the\r\n\r\nhammer  and  the sickle. For the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nthem, Communism does not mean concentration camps,\r\n\r\nlabour  camps  and  all  the  horrors  which   the\r\n\r\nAmerican, and lately the British, Press have  been\r\n\r\nprone to publicize. They understand it through the\r\n\r\npeople  who work for Communism, generally  sincere\r\n\r\npeople who feel a deep and abiding compassion  for\r\n\r\ntheir fellow human beings as much as the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister, but with this one difference: they\r\n\r\nhave  accepted a dogma. They have accepted  a  cut\r\n\r\nand  dried solution, a discipline which says  that\r\n\r\nthat is the answer and it is the only answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not accepted that answer because I hope\r\n\r\nthat one could have not only all the economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  benefits  which  a Communist  society  can\r\n\r\nproduce,  but also the human benefits of spiritual\r\n\r\nand  individual freedom - bourgeois ideas - but  ideas\r\n\r\nand  concepts  in which I have been  indoctrinated\r\n\r\nand in which I believe. I believe that whether  we\r\n\r\ngo   Communist  or  non-Communist  in  the  future\r\n\r\ndepends  on  whether  we can  build  up  a  clean,\r\n\r\nhealthy  political movement with clean and healthy\r\n\r\nleaders,  men who believe in democracy and  social\r\n\r\njustice  and who enter politics because they  want\r\n\r\nto serve and not because they want to loot. If you\r\n\r\ncan  find  enough  such  men,  honest,  able,  and\r\n\r\nprepared  to  work, you can fight  the  Communists\r\n\r\nwithout  guns. If you cannot, then you  resort  to\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O., to atom bombs and to hydrogen bombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, they do not need the hydrogen bomb,\r\n\r\nnor  curfews,  nor  barbed  wires,  nor  detention\r\n\r\ncamps, because the three conditions for revolution\r\n\r\nare not there. There is neither the political, the\r\n\r\neconomic,  nor the social urge. They do  not  hate\r\n\r\ntheir rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey do not feel an acute sense of injustice or of\r\n\r\npoverty.  They  do  not feel that  the  system  is\r\n\r\nunfair or unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister must realise that\r\n\r\nanti-Communism  is  an entirely barren  philosophy\r\n\r\nwhich can produce no results. I do not believe  in\r\n\r\nit. If I have to choose between Communism and anti-Communism,  I  will choose Communism  because  the\r\n\r\nother  is a barren, a negative philosophy. If  you\r\n\r\nhate  something  because  you  do  not  like  some\r\n\r\naspects of it, you can work yourself into a  state\r\n\r\nwhere anything said or done by the Communists must\r\n\r\nbe  wrong  and  evil.  I  have  taken  this  point\r\n\r\nstrongly because it is quite likely that my motion\r\n\r\nmay  not find favour with this House and only  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief Minister may be present at  these\r\n\r\ntalks.  He  has told us that he is  going  as  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister. I had not meant to be facetious or\r\n\r\nunkind  when I asked him what his mandate was.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a  right to know what he proposes to  do  at\r\n\r\nthese talks, for their outcome will affect us, not\r\n\r\njust  him as the Chief Minister. He might have  to\r\n\r\nresign  or  he  might have to  go  to  London  for\r\n\r\nfurther consultation. But it will affect each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one  of  us in this Assembly  and  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  The two other persons who are  going  to\r\n\r\nthese  miniature  summit talks have  got  definite\r\n\r\nmandates.  Mr  Chin  Peng represents  a  definite\r\n\r\ngroup.  He knows exactly what he is going  to  the\r\n\r\ntalks  for and he is going to bargain for as  good\r\n\r\nconditions as he can possibly get, if he  can  get\r\n\r\nthem  from  the  Tunku in the Federation.  But  he\r\n\r\nknows  exactly  what he is going  for.  He  is  no\r\n\r\namateur   politician.  He  is  no  lawyer   turned\r\n\r\npolitician.  He has become part of a revolutionary\r\n\r\nmovement - part  of a revolution. I  know  that  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Minister for Communications  and  Works\r\n\r\nwants to fight Communism. He does not bother about\r\n\r\nunderstanding it. I am interested in understanding\r\n\r\nit  because if you do not understand it, the  odds\r\n\r\nare that you will never be able to fight it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has also a definite mandate. He went\r\n\r\ninto the elections on it and won - 800,000 votes - his\r\n\r\nplatform  being that if he became Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nhe was going to give an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namnesty  and  settle the Emergency. He  has  since\r\n\r\nsaid that he will go there and explain the amnesty\r\n\r\nterms  and  he will also listen to what  Mr  Chin\r\n\r\nPeng has to say on behalf of the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Chief Minister has said this morning\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chief Minister of the Federation  would\r\n\r\nnot  welcome my presence nor the presence of other\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from this Assembly. I have a great\r\n\r\nregard,  Sir,  for  the  Chief  Minister  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation. He is a modest, unassuming man who can\r\n\r\nsay, without  arrogance, that  he  represents  at\r\n\r\nleast some three million odd people of Malaya.  He\r\n\r\nis  a  courteous man and I do not believe he would\r\n\r\nhave  used the words: \"I would not welcome  either\r\n\r\nLee Kuan Yew or any Members of the Opposition.\"  I\r\n\r\nshould  hate to imagine that those were his  words\r\n\r\nand  I  feel that the Hon. the Chief Minister  has\r\n\r\ndone him an injustice when he put that message  in\r\n\r\nthat particular form. He of all people understands\r\n\r\nthat this is not a question to be settled by Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters.  This  is a question ultimately  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved by the people of Malaya, which means,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  by  those who have influence  over  large\r\n\r\nmasses  of the people of Malaya, by those who,  by\r\n\r\ntheir  work  and their devotion to the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe people, have that influence over the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope that before this debate is over,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Minister will tell us what  is\r\n\r\nhis  mandate for these talks. He has said that  he\r\n\r\nis  going  there as Chief Minister at the  request\r\n\r\nand  invitation  of  the  Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Surely he cannot expect us  to  accept\r\n\r\nsuch   a   supercilious - perhaps  supercilious   is\r\n\r\nunkind - but such a superficial reply? What  is  the\r\n\r\nmandate?  What  are his terms of  reference?  What\r\n\r\ndoes he propose to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have suggested in my\r\n\r\nresolution  that all political Parties  should  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  because  we in  Singapore  are  in  a\r\n\r\nslightly  different position from the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Tunku in the Federation can safely say to Mr\r\n\r\nChin  Peng,  \"I  speak  for  the  people  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\" Fifty-one out of the fifty-two elected represent-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntatives are members of the Alliance of which he is\r\n\r\nthe  titular and the real head. I do not mean this\r\n\r\nas  a  slight to our Chief Minister, but the facts\r\n\r\nof  the position in Singapore must be faced. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  the Hon. the Chief Minister  can  say,\r\n\r\nfrom   a  position  of  strength  to  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party representative, that he speaks for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. He would be  in  a  much\r\n\r\nbetter  position if he had with him  members  from\r\n\r\nall  the political Parties. Then, we together  can\r\n\r\nsay,  \"These are the terms which we feel are  fair\r\n\r\nand just for the settlement of this country and we\r\n\r\nspeak for the people of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\ntook  pride  in  the  fact  that  it  was  he  who\r\n\r\nsuggested, when constitutional matters were to  be\r\n\r\nsettled  in  London, that \"It is not a matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front.  The  Labour  Front  seeks  no\r\n\r\nbenefit from it, no kudos. It is not a matter  for\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance or the Coalition. It is  a  national\r\n\r\nmatter, one for all Parties, for all the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  And it was he who told the  Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State for the Colonies that he would  head  an\r\n\r\nAll-Party delegation to London to settle  an  all-Singapore  problem which he himself,  even  if  he\r\n\r\nrepresents not only the Labour Front but also  the\r\n\r\nCoalition, could not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\napologise  if  I  have given the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister any indication that I think he is  not  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  would respond to the House  with  the\r\n\r\nhighest  of  political  principles  and  political\r\n\r\nmotives. But I ask him seriously to consider  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  not  from  the point  of  view  of  Party\r\n\r\nadvantage - for I seek none in this motion - but  from\r\n\r\nthe   point  of  view  of  the  interests  of  his\r\n\r\nGovernment and of the country, that he  should  go\r\n\r\nwith  representatives from the  other  Parties  so\r\n\r\nthat  he could then talk from a stronger position.\r\n\r\nI  know there are other political Parties here who\r\n\r\nare  alarmed at the prospect of having to  meet  a\r\n\r\nCommunist Secretary-General. They want to leave it\r\n\r\nentirely  to Chief Ministers. In fact, I  remember\r\n\r\nthe nominal leader of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgressive Party saying in the Press that  if  we\r\n\r\nall  went,  we  would increase  the  prestige  and\r\n\r\nposition  of  the representative from the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party.  I  do not  see  how  one  could\r\n\r\npossibly  increase the prestige and reputation  of\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Communist Party representative. He  is\r\n\r\nalready   meeting  two  Chief  Ministers   as   an\r\n\r\nequal - the Chief Minister of the Federation and the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  of Singapore under  British  rule\r\n\r\nmeet  the  \"Chief Minister\" of both Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation under Communist rule. I  think  we\r\n\r\nwould  do  much  better if we met  as  leaders  of\r\n\r\npolitical   groups  in  the  Federation   and   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, faced with a common problem. Let us not\r\n\r\nsuppose  that we can solve this thing by banishing\r\n\r\n8,000 people to China. Let us not suppose that  we\r\n\r\ncan solve this thing by telling Mr Chin Peng, \"If\r\n\r\nyou  bring  Communism  to Malaya,  then  we  shall\r\n\r\nstarve\",  because he does not believe  it.  If  he\r\n\r\ndid,  he  would not have fought for  so  long.  He\r\n\r\nbelieves that a Communist Malaya is going to be  a\r\n\r\nprosperous and a happy Malaya where he is going to\r\n\r\nsolve  all  these economic injustices,  where  all\r\n\r\nthis nonsense of expatriate pay and upgrading  and\r\n\r\ntravelling allowances and entertainment allowances\r\n\r\nwill  be thrown into the limbo of the 'feudalistic\r\n\r\nmedieval past'. And by God I believe he would in a\r\n\r\nvery  short  time. And I would cheer him  when  he\r\n\r\ndoes  that, because they are parts of the  present\r\n\r\nwhich I hate, and I would like to see them part of\r\n\r\nthe forgotten past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move that we record our belief that\r\n\r\nit  is in the best interests of this country if we\r\n\r\nmeet  as  political leaders to settle a  political\r\n\r\nproblem  in Malaya. We cannot concede a  Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya  at  these  talks, nor can  Mr  Chin  Peng\r\n\r\nconcede  an anti-Communist Malaya at these  talks.\r\n\r\nEven so great and respectable a man as Mr Anthony\r\n\r\nEden,  Prime Minister of Britain, came on the  air\r\n\r\nover  Radio Malaya and said, \"We must find  a  way\r\n\r\nout.\"  I  believe, if we are prepared to work,  to\r\n\r\nremove the economic and social injustices in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  then we need not be afraid  that  Malaya\r\n\r\nwill  go under. But if we are not prepared to work\r\n\r\nand if we want to preserve all the privileges and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  the  inequalities existing  today,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, we shall have to go back and put all kinds\r\n\r\nof  prohibitions  which will cause  the  talks  to\r\n\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all want peace in Malaya. We\r\n\r\nare  sick  of  the Emergency. We are sick  of  the\r\n\r\nenormous expense that this struggle has cost us in\r\n\r\nschools and hospitals, in social services  and  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment. For the fight to continue, if it  can\r\n\r\nbe  resolved, would be a folly. That is not to say\r\n\r\nthat  one should resolve the fight, in order  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  lose it in some other way. But  we  could\r\n\r\nresolve  this Emergency and fight, not with  guns,\r\n\r\nbut  with ideas. It is a battle of convictions,  a\r\n\r\nbattle  for minds, a battle for a way of life.  If\r\n\r\nyou  can  find  the  people who  can  resolve  the\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social injustices of  this  country\r\n\r\nbetter than the Malayan Communist Party can,  then\r\n\r\nyou need never be afraid that you cannot build  an\r\n\r\nindependent, democratic, non-Communist Malaya. And\r\n\r\nit is with that uppermost in our minds that an All-Party  delegation should sit down  with  Mr  Chin\r\n\r\nPeng and discuss the problems which confront us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> I rise to\r\n\r\nsecond the motion, Sir.

They  are  fed  up with  the  restrictions\r\n\r\nforced  on  them.  They want  peace  and  so  they\r\n\r\nrepudiated   the  Progressives  and   others   who\r\n\r\nsupported a war which can only benefit a  colonial\r\n\r\npower. The first act to end colonialism is to make\r\n\r\nthe  peace offer succeed. Should it fail, we would\r\n\r\noffer  the  British  a justification  to  continue\r\n\r\nruling us. All of us are agreed, and I should  say\r\n\r\nall  the  Malayans in this House are agreed,  that\r\n\r\ncolonialism  must  be ended. The  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  a unanimous mandate  for  this.  In\r\n\r\ncarrying  out this mandate, the London  talks  are\r\n\r\nonly  part  of and not the whole thing. The  peace\r\n\r\ntalks are also an important part. If the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister thinks that it is important to have\r\n\r\nan  All-Party delegation for the London  talks,  I\r\n\r\nthink that it is almost equally important to  have\r\n\r\nan All-Party delegation to the peace talks too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, the talks involve the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  this  country. It is  too  much  of  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to be taken on by  the  Government\r\n\r\nwith its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  small  majority. On the issues involved  at\r\n\r\nthese peace talks, Sir, the people of this country\r\n\r\nshould talk with one voice. Therefore, it is  only\r\n\r\nright  that the delegation to be led by  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister must compose of representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  both sides of the House. The Government must\r\n\r\nnot forget that, should the talks fail, it will be\r\n\r\nheld  responsible by the people of  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nhaving   sabotaged  the  anti-colonial   struggle.\r\n\r\nTherefore, not only in the interest of the  people\r\n\r\nbut  in  the interest of the Labour Front,  it  is\r\n\r\nadvisable for the Hon. the Chief Minister to  lead\r\n\r\nan All-Party delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

This meeting  is\r\n\r\nbeing  arranged  by  the  Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. It is part of his platform.

That this Assembly or any  Member\r\n\r\nthereof should at any time seriously consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion of forcing himself on this meeting  as  a\r\n\r\ngate-crasher  is,  to my mind, something  that  is\r\n\r\nbeneath  the  concepts of anyone  with  any  self-respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been asked what is my mandate and what I\r\n\r\nam  to  do.

It  would  be\r\n\r\ninformative and helpful that I, as Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nof Singapore, should be present at these talks.  I\r\n\r\nhave made it sufficiently clear that I am a junior\r\n\r\npartner  in  this  venture. I  do  not  anticipate\r\n\r\ntaking  either a major or any vital  part  in  the\r\n\r\ntalks between the Tunku and this man, Chin Peng. I\r\n\r\ncan  but  regret the effort made in this House  to\r\n\r\nseek to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpose  ourselves  upon  the  hospitality  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation in a manner which must deeply embarrass\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar, in a speech whose\r\n\r\nlike  I  had never hoped to hear in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nglorifying  these so-called anti-colonial  forces,\r\n\r\nhas  suggested  summit talks  between  equal  men.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing, Sir. The leader of a  band\r\n\r\nwho has been terrorising the country in parts has\r\n\r\nbeen  asked  to  meet the Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation at the Chief Minister's convenience. It\r\n\r\nhas been suggested by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nthat  it is for us to go there and have terms that\r\n\r\nare  fair and just for settlement. Sir, if  it  is\r\n\r\nthe   wish   of  this  House  to  negotiate   with\r\n\r\nCommunists  for terms that are fair and  just  for\r\n\r\nsettlement, this House has every right to take its\r\n\r\nown  initiative  to make its own arrangements  for\r\n\r\nits   own   meeting  for  negotiations  with   the\r\n\r\nCommunists, but when to every man who can read, to\r\n\r\nevery   man  who  can  hear,  it  has  been   made\r\n\r\nabundantly  clear  by the Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   that   there  is   no   question   of\r\n\r\nnegotiations and for responsible Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to seek to suggest, through this Assembly\r\n\r\nto  the  country,  that that is all  eye-wash  and\r\n\r\nthat,  in fact, the Chief Minister and I are going\r\n\r\nto  discuss terms fair and just for settlement is,\r\n\r\nto  say the least, to embarrass very seriously our\r\n\r\ngood  and  close neighbours who are the  main,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  principal sufferers from the terrorism\r\n\r\nof  which the Member for Tanjong Pagar calls anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks of the basic conditions of discontent\r\n\r\nwhich exist in the Federation and which will  find\r\n\r\ntheir  outlet  in the same way that they  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I will say this to you, Sir, that in so\r\n\r\nfar   as  I  appreciate  the  conditions  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  the  entire country,  free  from  the\r\n\r\nequal of people like the Member for Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nhave  learnt  to  respect and revere  their  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, have complete faith in his integrity, in\r\n\r\nhis sincerity, and in his ability to bring to them\r\n\r\nthe  political independence which they crave;  and\r\n\r\nthere  can be no question whatsoever of the people\r\n\r\nof the Federation seeking to find an outlet for so-called discontent by joining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  gentlemen whom the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nhas  glorified to the summit of equality with  the\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Federation and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested by the hon. Member that to\r\n\r\ndeny  a  fair  settlement to  these  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nforces, as he terms them, is to be a colonial. The\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar is not unread. He is  not\r\n\r\nwithout  knowledge of the fact  that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmost   vicious  colonial  power  of  today  is   a\r\n\r\nCommunist  power - Russia. There is no  power  which\r\n\r\nhas  as many colonies and which controls them more\r\n\r\nstringently than the people of Moscow.  He  speaks\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists as being anti-colonial forces.\r\n\r\nThey  have battled arduously, admittedly. Many  of\r\n\r\nthem  believe  with sincerity in  their  doctrine,\r\n\r\nunquestionably. Many of them are dedicated to  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  Communism. That is perfectly true.  But\r\n\r\nlet  us recognise this fact: They are not fighting\r\n\r\ncolonialism. They are fighting for Communism which\r\n\r\nis   a   worse  form  of  colonialism   than   the\r\n\r\ncolonialism   we  have  here  today.   We   cannot\r\n\r\nsufficiently, Sir, recognise that fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that we have reached a\r\n\r\nstalemate in a war of equals. I would remind  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that  if they are equals,  then  why  the\r\n\r\namnesty?  If  there are true nationalists  in  the\r\n\r\nCommunist group, they must recognise the fact that\r\n\r\nsince  these first few months, there has been  set\r\n\r\nin  motion machinery which can, in truth, and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   achieve  the  nationalism  that  we  all - I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  the honest and the dishonest - seek;  that\r\n\r\nthese  Communists who have used the cover of anti-colonialism  and nationalism now  stand  naked  in\r\n\r\ntheir  true colours to a greater extent than  even\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member has shown his own  colours  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.  These  Communists recognise  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  today they are not fighting a colonial power\r\n\r\nand  cannot pretend to. They are not fighting  for\r\n\r\nnationalism  because  all their  bullets  and  all\r\n\r\ntheir  arson  have not achieved it and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nother   forces  working  peacefully  through   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process have every legitimate rea-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nson  for  believing  that the  democratic  process\r\n\r\nwill,  within  a  matter of a  few  months,  bring\r\n\r\nconcrete  and  definite evidence  of  early  self-government   and  independence.  Those   Communist\r\n\r\nforces  in  the jungle, Sir, must be conscious  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that to the public, they stand stripped.\r\n\r\nThey  stand, Sir, as obviously as anything visible\r\n\r\nto  the  human eye as being not anti-colonial  but\r\n\r\nanti-national. These Communist forces are  seeking\r\n\r\ntheir own form of government and they always will,\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way  that foreign ideology  through\r\n\r\nCommunism  is seeking the overthrow of the  Indian\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and has sought the overthrow  through\r\n\r\nviolent means of the Burmese Government even  when\r\n\r\nBurma  was  independent. These are  not  basically\r\n\r\nnationalist forces. These are the forces that seek\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of only one ideology, and in order\r\n\r\nto  maintain their camouflage, they recognise  that\r\n\r\nnow   that   their  activity  is  being  obviously\r\n\r\ndirected  against  the people's governments,  they\r\n\r\nmust  come  out  and  cease  these  activities  of\r\n\r\nviolence  which have brought no benefit  to  them,\r\n\r\nwhich give them no hope of success whatsoever. Not\r\n\r\neven the flamboyant imagination of the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  could conceive  of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nforces  in  the  Federation achieving  victory  by\r\n\r\nviolence against the Tunku and the people  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. That is the stalemate in the  language\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. - a  complete  and  utter  loss,   a\r\n\r\ncomplete and utter failure. An absolute necessity,\r\n\r\nif  they  are  to achieve anything for  their  own\r\n\r\nideology,  is  that they should now put  down  the\r\n\r\nrifle   and   take  up  the  poison  of   internal\r\n\r\nsubversion of which the hon. Member has far closer\r\n\r\nacquaintance  than even I. That is  the  position,\r\n\r\nSir,  the so-called stalemate - an absolute  failure\r\n\r\nof  the war as it is termed by the hon. Member, an\r\n\r\nabsolute  failure of violence by  rebels  who  now\r\n\r\nwish  to  come  out, allegedly to pursue  peaceful\r\n\r\nvocations, and let us hope that many of  them  are\r\n\r\nsincere about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this Government fell in with the views of the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of the Federation in  the  amnesty\r\n\r\nwas  just  this  one argument that there  are  and\r\n\r\nthere have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   in  this  country  men  of  integrity   and\r\n\r\nsincerity, nationals to the very core,  who,  sick\r\n\r\nof  the  colonialism  which tethered  them,  which\r\n\r\ndegraded  them,  unable  to  find  an  outlet  for\r\n\r\nattack, took to this form of violence as the  only\r\n\r\nmeans  of achieving that end. I do not think  that\r\n\r\nnumber  is  very great, unfortunately,  because  I\r\n\r\nthink  that, having gone that way, they  soon  get\r\n\r\ncaught  in the web and they find it too difficult - the  weakness  of the human spirit and  the  human\r\n\r\nflesh - to retract from a position on a point of  no\r\n\r\nreturn. But there may well be some - and the amnesty\r\n\r\nis  intended  for  them - but  in  considering  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  let  us remember a few basic home  truths\r\n\r\nwhich  I  shall repeat. Singapore does not  govern\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The revolt is in the  Federation,\r\n\r\nnot  in Singapore. The meeting is arranged by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of the Federation. It  is  not  my\r\n\r\nmeeting  or  your meeting, Sir, or the meeting  of\r\n\r\nany Member of this Assembly. I may be permitted to\r\n\r\nattend, and I certainly am, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has been indicated as a man who is the\r\n\r\nsoul  of  courtesy,  and he is  happy  to  certain\r\n\r\nsuggestions  that I make. But I do appreciate  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  taken  about the venue  and  about  the\r\n\r\narrangements. What the Tunku says at  the  meeting\r\n\r\nis  entirely the decision of the Chief Minister of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation at which I have the  privilege  of\r\n\r\nbeing  present.  That is the true position.  Those\r\n\r\nwho vote in favour of this motion vote to be gate-crashers, vote to give honour and glory to a group\r\n\r\nthat has murdered and burnt and destroyed, a group\r\n\r\nthat  itself  recognises its inability  to  pursue\r\n\r\nfurther  a  course of action which has brought  it\r\n\r\nand  can bring it no victory, and which now  seeks\r\n\r\nto  come out of the jungle. Once more, let  it  be\r\n\r\nclear  that  there is no question of  negotiation,\r\n\r\nand this is the Tunku's decision. He has indicated\r\n\r\nquite  clearly  that  there  is  no  question   of\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  \"I  am\", he has said  repeatedly  in\r\n\r\npublic, \"going to explain to him the terms of the\r\n\r\namnesty and I shall be quite happy to hear what he\r\n\r\nhas to say.\" Let us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  away from this rhetoric, from this effort  to\r\n\r\nseek to control the destiny of the Federation by a\r\n\r\nsmall group in Singapore whose sympathies seem  to\r\n\r\nlie  elsewhere  than  in the  traditions  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  future  of this country  cannot  be  of\r\n\r\ngreater concern to the colonial officials than  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  this country.  That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nrespected Chief Minister of the Federation,  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman, said a few weeks ago that he  found\r\n\r\nhimself in a difficult position. The people wanted\r\n\r\npeace  but  the Director of Operations  wanted  to\r\n\r\ndestroy the Communists by military force, a method\r\n\r\nwhich  has continuously failed for the last  seven\r\n\r\nyears.    The   people   naturally   want   peace.\r\n\r\nContinuation of the Emergency cannot be  in  their\r\n\r\ninterests,  for  it  is only under  conditions  of\r\n\r\npeace  that democracy has a chance to flourish  in\r\n\r\nMalaya. The people generally are sick and tired of\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency.  General Bourne and  the  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials may not be tired. As a matter  of  fact,\r\n\r\ncolonial   officials  have  come  to  regard   the\r\n\r\nEmergency, together with all the Emergency  powers\r\n\r\nin  their  hands,  as part of  the  life  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  The  cry  of Communist  subversion,  the\r\n\r\nlibelling of individuals and Parties as Communists\r\n\r\nor Communist-inspired, and the danger of detention\r\n\r\nwithout trial - all these things help colonialism to\r\n\r\nkill  the enthusiasm of those who hate colonialism\r\n\r\nand  who would replace it with a free, independent\r\n\r\nand democratic Malaya. In short, the Emergency has\r\n\r\nacted  as a check on the growth and activities  of\r\n\r\nall   progressive  nationalist  forces   in   this\r\n\r\ncountry. As far as the majority of the people  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  Emergency  has  meant   heartless\r\n\r\nrestrictions on basic democratic liberties. It has\r\n\r\nalso  meant the expenditure of large sums of money\r\n\r\non  military campaigns to exterminate the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party.  All these resources  and  money\r\n\r\ncould  have  been  more profitably  used  for  the\r\n\r\nsocial  and economic development of this  country.\r\n\r\nThe  Emergency has wasted human lives and material\r\n\r\nresources  without  achieving a single  beneficial\r\n\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven years of warfare with foreign troops\r\n\r\nand  mercenaries of all kinds roaming the  country,\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Communist Party still remains with us.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Emergency  in this country  was  merely  a\r\n\r\nmilitary  problem, the military method  would  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded long ago in exterminating Communism.  The\r\n\r\narmed might of Communism is far less imposing  than\r\n\r\nthe  armed might of British imperialism.  Mr  Chin\r\n\r\nPeng  does  not have helicopters. Neither  does  he\r\n\r\nhave security forces - an armed force of 300,000  men\r\n\r\nwith  all  the  weapons of modern warfare.  Neither\r\n\r\ndoes  he have prisons and detention camps where  he\r\n\r\nmay  detain  without  trial  people  suspected   of\r\n\r\ncolonial  sympathies.  It  is  clear  that  if  the\r\n\r\nEmergency   was  purely  a  military   problem   of\r\n\r\ndisposing of a few hundred troublemakers, it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been disposed of long ago by military forces,\r\n\r\nbut  unfortunately for General Templer and  General\r\n\r\nBourne, the Emergency is not a military problem. It\r\n\r\nhas   its  making  in  the  political,  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions  in  the  country,  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich make thousands of people feel that they  have\r\n\r\nno  place  in  a  colonial society, and  since  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  is political in nature, it can  only  be\r\n\r\nsettled by political means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party holds the belief that the real solution\r\n\r\nto the Emergency is to take a lesson from our great\r\n\r\nneighbours - India, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia -  who\r\n\r\ndo  not exclude their local Communist Parties  from\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional  processes which  govern  these\r\n\r\ncountries. If our Chief Minister were half as  wise\r\n\r\nas  Nehru or Soekarno, there could be an end to the\r\n\r\nEmergency in this country. My Party feels that  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of  the Emergency  would  provide  an\r\n\r\nexcuse for the colonial powers to go on denying the\r\n\r\nMalayan  people  their democratic  rights  and  the\r\n\r\nfreedom to run their own affairs as they choose. As\r\n\r\nsuch, colonial officials are hardly to be entrusted\r\n\r\nwith the direction and control of negotiations with\r\n\r\nthe   Malayan  Communist  Party  for   a   peaceful\r\n\r\nsettlement of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present arrangements, it must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  assumed  that  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  is\r\n\r\nguided  solely  by  the colonial officials  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  negotiations with the Malayan Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  The chances are that the colonial officials\r\n\r\nare  not  interested in the peaceful settlement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency.  That is why  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister should take the people of the country into\r\n\r\nhis  confidence,  through their representatives  of\r\n\r\npolitical parties. After all, it is our country and\r\n\r\nwe   have  a  bigger  stake  in  it  than  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials and colonial soldiers. The Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister would, if he had a sense of responsibility\r\n\r\nto  the people of this country, consult the elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people in this Assembly  and\r\n\r\nthen  seek  to  plan a peaceful settlement  of  the\r\n\r\nEmergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly warn the elected representatives of the\r\n\r\npeople  in this Assembly that if they do  not  take\r\n\r\nthe responsibility for a peaceful settlement of the\r\n\r\nEmergency  into their own hands, there will  be  no\r\n\r\npeaceful  settlement. The Malayan  people  will  be\r\n\r\ncondemned   to  further  years  of  bloodshed   and\r\n\r\nsuppressive  laws  and  hopes  of  democratic   and\r\n\r\npeaceful   progress  in  this   country   will   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed.  I ask all self-respecting  Malayans  in\r\n\r\nthis House to vote for the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I\r\n\r\nrise  to move an amendment to this motion,  may  I,\r\n\r\nwith your permission, express my great appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  stands taken by the hon.

The  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister, on the one hand, believes that\r\n\r\nif  he  despises or is determined  to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\nCommunism, then he must use all his means, even  to\r\n\r\nthe extent of allying himself with colonialism,  to\r\n\r\nachieve his aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we  can  understand the motive  of  and  the\r\n\r\ndetermination shown by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwhen he moved this motion. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat if we want to get rid of colonialism, we must\r\n\r\nuse  all  means,  even to allying  ourselves  with\r\n\r\nCommunism, to attain this objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I came to touch on this subject, a\r\n\r\nfew  of my friends said, \"Do not touch it!  It  is\r\n\r\nhigh  politics!  It  is very  dangerous!\"  Sir,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  bear  to  think of the sufferings  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  the  eight years of  Emergency  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. At least, we in Singapore have been in\r\n\r\na  better position. I have a strong belief that it\r\n\r\nis  now high time clearly to admit that a military\r\n\r\npolicy  to solve a political problem is a  failure\r\n\r\nand that we in this country should try our best to\r\n\r\nfind  any means, not merely by the use of military\r\n\r\npower, to settle this vital issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it will be recalled that quite often\r\n\r\nwe  have heard that the Emergency is going to end,\r\n\r\nand  that  the  bandits are not  more  than  5,000\r\n\r\nstrong. That has been repeated and repeated many a\r\n\r\ntime by generals and commanders and even, if I  am\r\n\r\nnot   mistaken,  by  the  Rt.  Hon.  Mr   Malcolm\r\n\r\nMacDonald. But we are still faced with this threat\r\n\r\ntoday,  and  the  Malayan  Communist  Party  still\r\n\r\nremains  5,000 strong, and nobody in this  country\r\n\r\nat this moment can tell us when and how we can end\r\n\r\nthis  Emergency. So, it is solely for this reason,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  appreciate,  that our  courageous  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  is prepared to accept the invitation  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister of the Federation, Tunku Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman, to take part in the coming peace talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since our Chief Minister has clearly stated\r\n\r\nthat he is only just an invited guest, and that he\r\n\r\nis  a  junior partner, it is unjustified that this\r\n\r\nmotion  should  be introduced that  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister should lead an All-Party delegation\r\n\r\nto  the talks with the Malayan Communist Party. My\r\n\r\nreasons  for opposing the motion are two. Firstly,\r\n\r\nwe  already know that neither the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister,  nor  anybody in this country,  has  any\r\n\r\nright  to  interfere with the internal affairs  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. Secondly, I will quote\r\n\r\nan old English proverb: \"Too many cooks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspoil  the broth.\" We have seen, especially during\r\n\r\nthese   five  days  of  debate,  how  much   party\r\n\r\ndifferences or party politics have come into  play\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, and we should not be surprised\r\n\r\nif some enthusiastic Member, on meeting Chin Peng,\r\n\r\nwere to say, \"Oh, my brother, my comrade, you  are\r\n\r\ngoing to become the President of Malaya!\" Or there\r\n\r\nmight  be someone who would say, \"Look, Chin Peng,\r\n\r\nI  am  going  to ask for more tanks and  bombs  to\r\n\r\ndrive   you   entirely  out  of   this   country!\"\r\n\r\nTherefore,  honestly  speaking,  I  think  it   is\r\n\r\npossible  to  visualise such  a  situation  taking\r\n\r\nplace  and I do not think it is wise for the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister to lead a delegation  of  such\r\n\r\ndiametrically opposite views to meet Chin Peng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the amendment that I propose to move reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House considers it in the best\r\n\r\ninterests   of  the  country  that  all  political\r\n\r\nparties in the Assembly should be consulted before\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Minister  goes  to  meet  the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to discuss a peaceful  settlement\r\n\r\nof  the  Emergency  in order to  bring  peace  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my reason for moving this amendment is that\r\n\r\nI   believe   that,   despite   the   many   Party\r\n\r\ndifferences, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I first have the hon.\r\n\r\nMember's  amendment  in writing,  please?

We  can  expect  all\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  to express their  opinions  on\r\n\r\nthese  peace  talks  unless  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  his own decision  to  say  what  is\r\n\r\nright,  not  only to Chin Peng but  also  even  to\r\n\r\nTunku  Abdul  Rahman. You know very well  that  my\r\n\r\nEnglish  is poor. I had better make it very  clear\r\n\r\nby  saying that the reason why I press this  point\r\n\r\nis  that  it is important that the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, before he goes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  see  Chin Peng, must have an All-Party mandate\r\n\r\non   this  one  question - the  recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Communist Party. I am sure many of us have\r\n\r\nbeen  told,  \"Please, for goodness  sake,  do  not\r\n\r\ntouch  this controversial issue.\" Yet,  I  am  the\r\n\r\nnaughtiest  boy and I am purposely  going  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  a  fervent  and  ardent  believer  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy. I think it is an injustice to  let  any\r\n\r\npolitical Party, if it is unarmed, go underground.\r\n\r\nIt  sometimes puzzles me, since it does  not  make\r\n\r\nmuch  difference because if the Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  put  down their arms, they can be  compared\r\n\r\nwith our People's Action Party, which is now here!\r\n\r\nI  am  of  the view that if the Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  can  accept  a conditional  recognition  of\r\n\r\ntheir  Party,  why  not we try?  Of  course,  many\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  will have  different  opinions\r\n\r\nabout  that, but at least now the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  can have my view that I am supporting  a\r\n\r\nconditional  recognition of the Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  if it will stop its acts of arson,  killing\r\n\r\nand murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Sir, the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister must have received this invitation\r\n\r\nto  meet Mr Chin Peng, or must have received some\r\n\r\nother  invitations in India, Pakistan or  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse,  before  the 9th November  when  he  had  an\r\n\r\nelected  majority on his side. Sir,  the  position\r\n\r\ntoday  is quite different. It is eleven over there\r\n\r\nand,  as  such,  he cannot talk on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. Sir, because of this, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  his  duty,  before he  does  anything,  to\r\n\r\nconsult  the Opposition who have got more  elected\r\n\r\nMembers.  I  thought  the  Government  would  have\r\n\r\nresigned long ago when this situation arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Keep hoping!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

By the support of a colonial  power - the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom. Sir, in a true democracy anywhere\r\n\r\nin  the  world,  it is the people who  govern  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Singapore is not in  that  state  today.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Hon. the Chief Minister in his  address\r\n\r\nmentioned Communist Russia and so on. I believe  I\r\n\r\nam  right in saying, and anybody can correct me if\r\n\r\nI  am  wrong,  that  England,  our  masters,  have\r\n\r\nrecognised Communist Russia. India has, Burma has,\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia  has. I do not say that  we  should\r\n\r\nrecognise  Communist Russia. We are  not  a  self-governing  country yet. What we shall do  will  be\r\n\r\nour business when we are free and self-governing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister also said that\r\n\r\nwe  are not going to sit down on equal terms  with\r\n\r\nMr   Chin  Peng  to  discuss  peace.  I  am   not\r\n\r\ncommenting  on  that but what I do  say  is  this.\r\n\r\nThere  are  strikes in Singapore and in  order  to\r\n\r\navoid  these strikes, do we not sit down with  the\r\n\r\nstrikers and discuss: \"Why are you doing this? Why\r\n\r\ncannot  you  call  off  the  strikes  for  the\r\n\r\nbetterment of the city and society?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember those days - I am not discussing\r\n\r\nthe  pre-war Singapore that has seen 123 years  of\r\n\r\nBritish  rule - but I am just drawing  attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  reoccupation  of Singapore  in  1945  when  I\r\n\r\nhappened   to   be   in   the   British   Military\r\n\r\nAdministration  Council and I well remember,  Sir,\r\n\r\nMr  Wu  Tien Wang and many others who  made  very\r\n\r\ngood  speeches for the betterment of the city  and\r\n\r\nthey  were invited to the homes of the then  chief\r\n\r\nof Singapore, Sir Ralph Hone, and others. I do not\r\n\r\nknow   what  happened  later  on.  Many  of   them\r\n\r\ndisappeared.  I am told that some  who  are  doing\r\n\r\nthis  fighting  are dissatisfied nationalists.  If\r\n\r\nthat  is so, would it not be advisable on our part\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"Look here, brother, why are  you  doing\r\n\r\nthis? Why are you causing this misery, looting and\r\n\r\nkilling? What is wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that, by sitting together, we might\r\n\r\nconvince  Mr Chin Peng to come over to our  side.\r\n\r\nIf he does not, well, the result is clear for both\r\n\r\nthe Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bandoeng Conference attended by the\r\n\r\nAsian  powers  has accepted the  doctrine  or  the\r\n\r\nideal   of  Panchshila,  that  is,  peaceful   co-existence.   There  have  been  many   conferences\r\n\r\nattended,  amongst others, by England and  France,\r\n\r\nwhere  they  have sat down with Communist  Russia,\r\n\r\nand talked in terms of world betterment. If we can\r\n\r\nachieve something for the good of our own city  or\r\n\r\nthe  people  just by talking, why  not?  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told just now by the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  that he has been invited  by  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister of the Federation to be present  at\r\n\r\nthe talks. If he is going there just to attend  as\r\n\r\nan  observer, that is his business. I am  sure  he\r\n\r\ncannot commit us in whatever talks he has when  he\r\n\r\nis  going  as  an observer or just to  be  present\r\n\r\nthere.  But  if  he wants to commit  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nanything, then it is his duty to see that we,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, who command the majority of the  votes\r\n\r\nand  represent Singapore on this side of the House\r\n\r\nand not on the Government side, be consulted. Even\r\n\r\nif  the  Hon. the Chief Minister goes,  though  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not represent Singapore, we do not mind  his\r\n\r\ngoing  provided he consults the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\non this side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is one more thing which is\r\n\r\npersonal.  My  friend  the  Member  for  Sembawang\r\n\r\n(Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) mentioned that he is  an\r\n\r\nIndependent and there was some remark made by  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister. Sir, I am an Independent\r\n\r\nMember  myself. I join this one side or the  other\r\n\r\nside  if  I  hold to certain convictions.  I  have\r\n\r\nretired  from active business since four  to  five\r\n\r\nyears. The Communists would never accept me  if  I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  be  a Communist.

Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, no doubt there are Members of this House  who\r\n\r\nwill  regard my action in rising to take  part  in\r\n\r\nthis    debate   as   \"intervention\",   but    the\r\n\r\nconstitution being what it is, I have  the right\r\n\r\nand they must hear me out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I should like to make it clear here that I\r\n\r\nhave been an opponent of immediate self-government\r\n\r\nbut not of eventual self-government, but I wish to\r\n\r\nsay that, to me, Sir, this is the most unfortunate\r\n\r\nmotion  ever  placed  before  this  Assembly,  not\r\n\r\nexcluding  that made by the Progressive  Party  on\r\n\r\n25th July when they put forward a motion for a new\r\n\r\nconstitution providing for immediate independence.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate\" is the word I use, Sir, but  nothing\r\n\r\nthat  emanates  from the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nsurprises  me.  Of course, he has  never  lost  an\r\n\r\nopportunity at any time to try to explain away the\r\n\r\nEmergency - in speeches made on May 16th, I think it\r\n\r\nwas, and on dates around that time, he stated: the\r\n\r\nEmergency, of course, in his opinion, arises  from\r\n\r\nsocial   injustices   and  economic   ills,   mal-administration and failure to understand the  aims\r\n\r\nand   aspirations  of  a  resurgent   nationalism,\r\n\r\nblunders  of  stuffed-shirt colonial  officials - my\r\n\r\ngosh,  do not let me hear that word! - over a period\r\n\r\nof  eight  years, and all the clap-trap of  Marble\r\n\r\nArch  soapbox oratory ad nauseam on every possible\r\n\r\noccasion, as if there were millions of disaffected\r\n\r\ncitizens in the Federation of Malaya instead of  a\r\n\r\nfew thousands. He said there are eight thousand. I\r\n\r\nread  in  the  newspapers that it  is  only  three\r\n\r\nthousand. Anyway, it cannot be very many. He says,\r\n\r\n\"Of course, the security forces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  get  on with the business of keeping  down\r\n\r\nthe    Emergency   because   they    cannot    get\r\n\r\ninformation.\"   How   can   they   possibly    get\r\n\r\ninformation  from  citizens who  will  have  their\r\n\r\nthroats cut immediately if they give it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the hon. and learned Member is a\r\n\r\npolitician. So normally one would discount what he\r\n\r\nsays.  I  have sometimes thought that his  baiting\r\n\r\nthe  Government  on the subject of  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nwas  no  more than the carrying out of a directive\r\n\r\nfrom his principals, but it seemed to me yesterday\r\n\r\nin   the  debate  on  one  of  the  Heads  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates - Immigration, I think it was Head 56 - that\r\n\r\nwhat  he  is  really suffering from is xenophobia.\r\n\r\nSir,  even  this  aspect of the hon. and  learned\r\n\r\nGentleman's approach to the subject is not without\r\n\r\nironic  connotations in that  he  himself  has  an\r\n\r\nextremely Westernised education and every thought-form  he has is Westernised, so that he has to  go\r\n\r\non  beating  the anti-colonial drum  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrally  his  less  articulate  followers  and,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to  maintain his leadership, perhaps  his\r\n\r\nephemeral leadership, of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the audacity of this motion absolutely\r\n\r\nastounds  me.  He is obviously assuming  that  the\r\n\r\nChief Ministers of the respective territories  are\r\n\r\nto  meet those jungle heroes for talks - for  talks,\r\n\r\nif  you please - to discuss a peaceful settlement of\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency. What! As equals! I trust that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Ministers of these territories  will  treat\r\n\r\nthese canaille like the beaten enemies they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the People's Action Party - the\r\n\r\n\"Action\" part of it seems to me to be to drive the\r\n\r\ncountry headlong to perdition - never miss a  chance\r\n\r\nto  scream \"Merdeka\", which, of course,  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  Merdeka but just plain anti-colonialism.  It\r\n\r\nis  obvious.  I  mean,  if  every  time  they  say\r\n\r\n\"Merdeka\" I say \"Colonialism\", I will be within my\r\n\r\nrights - it will be a knight for their bishop!  Yet,\r\n\r\nas  the  Hon. the Chief Minister has said, roughly\r\n\r\nin  these  words, \"They are playing straight  into\r\n\r\nthe hands of the most insidious form of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonialism that the world has ever known and  far\r\n\r\noutside  the reach of their philosophy.\" Does  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar really think  that  Mr\r\n\r\nChin  Peng  is  some species of a Robin  Hood?  To\r\n\r\nspeak  utterly plainly, they are no more than  the\r\n\r\ntools  of  the  Moscow-Peking Axis  and  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember, when he assured the House - I think it  was\r\n\r\nMay  16th - that  in their struggle for  freedom  he\r\n\r\nwould fight anyone, even the Communists, was  just\r\n\r\ndeluding himself. In spite of his record, I  think\r\n\r\nthat  the little, slim Tarzans of the jungle would\r\n\r\ngive  him  pretty  short shrift. How  can  anyone,\r\n\r\nSir, - and  this  really has  not  been  touched  on\r\n\r\nenough  in this debate - who claims to be civilised,\r\n\r\ncondone  the  bloody and horrible murders,  mayhem\r\n\r\nand  foul,  masochistic acts by those  fiends  and\r\n\r\nthen try to excuse them by sophisticated arguments\r\n\r\non  doubtful  premises? No doubt, the proposer  of\r\n\r\nthis   motion   relishes  being  photographed   at\r\n\r\nwhatever will be the place in the ulu with all the\r\n\r\nParty  Members  in  diminishing precedence  behind\r\n\r\nhim. I think this is a scandalous motion, Sir, and\r\n\r\nI hope it will be heavily defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day may come, you know, when Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  look back nostalgically at  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen they could get up in this Assembly and, under\r\n\r\nthe  Royal Coat of Arms, with its \"Honi  soit  qui\r\n\r\nmal  y  pense\" and its \"Dieu et mon droit\",  twist\r\n\r\nthe  lion's tail with impunity and get  away  with\r\n\r\nit.  I  hope, Sir, that the Asian Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse   know  that  I  do  not  really   represent\r\n\r\ncolonialism, taipans, stuffed shirts,  etc.,  etc.\r\n\r\nThey  may think so, but they would be wrong. I  am\r\n\r\nmuch  more liberally-minded than many of them  may\r\n\r\nthink,  but  what  I have said this  afternoon,  I\r\n\r\nwould  not, in spite of all the sophistry and  the\r\n\r\nwit of the Member for Tanjong Pagar, cancel half a\r\n\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not feel so\r\n\r\nstrongly,  as  some  other  Members  do, on   the\r\n\r\niniquity  of the speech by the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.

He obviously is  a  man\r\n\r\nwho  reads  his Straits Times very thoroughly  and\r\n\r\ncarefully and he has a very good memory. As far as\r\n\r\nI  can recollect, pretty well every point that  he\r\n\r\nhas  made  has  appeared in  the  columns  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times in the last year or two, and he  has\r\n\r\ngiven an adequate summary of what that respectable\r\n\r\nnewspaper's opinion on this matter is. Apart  from\r\n\r\nthose opinions, I do not think he deserves all the\r\n\r\nreprobations that have been heaped on him,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to correct him before I come  to  the\r\n\r\nmain  body of his motion. I would like to  correct\r\n\r\nhim  on  one  or  two  small  points.  He  has   a\r\n\r\nfascinated interest in me. He can never keep to  a\r\n\r\nspeech without some reference to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTelecommunications and Mines, or the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTransport    and   Expectations,    or    whatever\r\n\r\nextraordinary new variant in my title  he  manages\r\n\r\nto  invent. But on this occasion, he got me right,\r\n\r\nthough he corrected himself and got wrong again as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  he  could. It was not a mistake  but  he\r\n\r\nactually got it right this time and the reason  he\r\n\r\nreferred  to  me was to bring in a remark  to  the\r\n\r\neffect,  I  think, that the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Works neither seeks  to  fight\r\n\r\nCommunism nor even to understand it.

I  have,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse   of  a  not  inactive  life,  lived   with\r\n\r\nCommunists  at  one  time  or  another  on   quite\r\n\r\nfriendly terms. People who are quite good  friends\r\n\r\nof  mine have been Communists or fellow-travellers\r\n\r\nor  crypto-Communists and all the other variations\r\n\r\nof  the  Communist organisation, and  I  have  no\r\n\r\nexaggerated  horror  of the Communist  system.  It\r\n\r\nseems  to me a very suitable system for a backward\r\n\r\ncountry  which has got into a mess and for  people\r\n\r\nwho  are in a general collapse, as Russia was when\r\n\r\nthe Communists got hold of Russia, or as China was\r\n\r\nwhen the Kuomintang gave way to the Communists.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that it is a nice system at all, but\r\n\r\nwhen  people have got into a mess you have to have\r\n\r\ndrastic  remedies.  You certainly  get  them  with\r\n\r\nCommunism,  and  they  probably  will  succeed  in\r\n\r\nlifting  up  the  economy of those two  countries.\r\n\r\nThey  have  in  Russia succeeded  in  making  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  economic progress.  They  have  gone\r\n\r\nrather backward in agriculture but they have  made\r\n\r\nenormous  progress  in heavy industry.  They  have\r\n\r\neven  been  able to distribute consumer  goods  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent  in Russia and make the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving go up a bit, so that I am not excited about\r\n\r\nCommunism. It is rather out of date, to  my  mind.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  waning philosophy which  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nvanish  from the world in the next ten or  fifteen\r\n\r\nyears -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They do not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not say that the Communist\r\n\r\nforces in Russia will vanish in ten or fifteen\r\n\r\nyears. I mean that what we might call the\r\n\r\napostolic impulse of Communism will vanish - it is\r\n\r\nmy guess, and I make no claims to be a prophet. I\r\n\r\ndo not claim to understand Communism perfectly but\r\n\r\nI have made some study of it and I think I\r\n\r\nprobably know just as much as the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar does about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit, particularly when he asserts that if Chin Peng\r\n\r\ngot  control of Malaya, all these allowances,  all\r\n\r\nthis privileged housing, all the differentials  in\r\n\r\npay  would  instantly vanish and withal  the  poor\r\n\r\nwould  be lifted up. That just is not the fact,  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid,  in  the history of  the  other  major\r\n\r\nCommunist countries. In Russia, when they came  in\r\n\r\nwith  Communism, they came in on  the  slogan  of:\r\n\r\n\"From  each  according  to his  ability,  to  each\r\n\r\naccording  to  his need.\" But they very  soon  saw\r\n\r\nthat  meant,  of  course, that you  got  what  you\r\n\r\nneeded and they very soon realised that that  cock\r\n\r\nwould not fight. They abandoned that for the other\r\n\r\nversion  which  is: \"From each  according  to  his\r\n\r\nability,\"  (which means you are going to  work  as\r\n\r\nhard as I can make you) \"and to each according  to\r\n\r\nhis  work.\" Thus, the man whose work is recognised\r\n\r\nby  the Communist Party as being valuable receives\r\n\r\na  country  villa plus a town flat, extra  rations\r\n\r\nand  coupons and all the comforts and luxuries  of\r\n\r\nlife.  But  the  chap whose work is recognised  as\r\n\r\nbeing  not  very  valuable  gets  very  much  less\r\n\r\nallotted to him; and anybody who does not work  at\r\n\r\nall     gets    into    a    perfectly    horrible\r\n\r\nsituation - forced  labour in the corrective  labour\r\n\r\ncamps - and  I  am  afraid, if you had  a  Communist\r\n\r\nregime here, you would necessarily follow the same\r\n\r\npattern.  The  idea  that you  would  abolish  all\r\n\r\ninequalities   and  privileges   by   establishing\r\n\r\nCommunism  here  is  just most  absolute  nonsense\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is no reason to suppose  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation  here  would  be  different   from   any\r\n\r\nexisting elsewhere. However, I only want  to  make\r\n\r\nthat  little point clear because there is so  much\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  about the nature  of  Communism,\r\n\r\nwhich is essentially a managerial system by which\r\n\r\nyou  take  control of the capital  assets  of  the\r\n\r\nState  and develop the capital formation. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  essential  basis of Communism,  and  profound\r\n\r\ncompassion  and so on does not really  operate  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I now want to come to the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nvery   interesting  motion  by  which   he   wants\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of all the Parties to go  to  meet\r\n\r\nChin Peng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  not  going to talk about that  in  general,\r\n\r\nbecause it has been quite sufficiently dealt  with\r\n\r\nby the Hon. the Chief Minister, but there are just\r\n\r\none or two practical difficulties about it which I\r\n\r\nwould like to point out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one arises from a remark made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit  Timah (Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong)\r\n\r\nearlier in this Budget sitting when he was talking\r\n\r\nabout  education. He then said very  energetically\r\n\r\nand   with   great  conviction  that   anybody - any\r\n\r\nChinese, I think - any Malayan or Chinese who  had\r\n\r\nreceived an English education was thereby cut  off\r\n\r\nfrom  his own people. The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwinced bitterly at this stab in the back from  one\r\n\r\nof  his own back-benchers. He had to admit that he\r\n\r\nhimself  had  no  connection with  the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and had no claim to represent them because\r\n\r\nhe  had  received  a  very lengthy  and  extremely\r\n\r\nsuccessful English education, but I do  feel  that\r\n\r\none  difficulty  is  that if  the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party were to go  to  meet  Chin\r\n\r\nPeng, his own followers would disown him and  say,\r\n\r\n\"We  cannot  allow  this man  to  claim  to  be  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the  people  because   he   is\r\n\r\nobviously disqualified by the fact that he has got\r\n\r\na  law  degree  or whatever degrees he  has  got.\"\r\n\r\nHowever,  that is perhaps a minor point  which  he\r\n\r\ncan settle with his own internal management of the\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater difficulty comes from something which\r\n\r\nhe  himself  said when we were talking  about  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Estimates and he described himself  as  a\r\n\r\nmouthpiece.  I thought that was an extraordinarily\r\n\r\ntrue  and accurate description of himself. It  was\r\n\r\nvery  frank of him to say quite boldly,  \"I  am  a\r\n\r\nmouthpiece.\" He claimed to be a mouthpiece putting\r\n\r\nforward  the words which other people had prepared\r\n\r\nfor  him  and he was coming in here to  play  them\r\n\r\nover, as it were, like a gramophone which could be\r\n\r\ncarried in here and would deliver the burden which\r\n\r\nhad been put into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in meeting Chin Peng, it seems to me clear\r\n\r\nthat you need to have leaders to meet a leader.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know Chin Peng, unless he is one of my old\r\n\r\nfriends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing by his Communist alias, but presumably he  is\r\n\r\na man of energy and leadership and he would require\r\n\r\nto meet other people of energy and leadership or he\r\n\r\nwould feel that he is wasting his time. And in  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  of the Federation, we  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nhave   a  man  who  has  very  high  qualities   of\r\n\r\nleadership, purpose and drive. I feel that we  also\r\n\r\nhave  a leader but of a different type, and a  very\r\n\r\nable   one   indeed,  in  our  Chief  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, a man who has dynamic drive. He  is  not\r\n\r\none  who  is  merely puffed along by the  words  of\r\n\r\nothers.  He  himself initiates things  and  secures\r\n\r\nsupport for them because he is so obviously  right.\r\n\r\nHe  is  not just a mere trumpet through which other\r\n\r\npeople blow their hot air. Now, Chin Peng is  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  a  busy  man  and  we  would  not  send  a\r\n\r\nmouthpiece  to  talk  to him! I  must  remind  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  his  qualities as a  mouthpiece  with\r\n\r\nmost  extraordinary success during this session.  I\r\n\r\nwould not like to estimate how long he has been  on\r\n\r\nhis  feet  and  how many words he has poured  forth\r\n\r\nover us, but I do feel that if he did go to discuss\r\n\r\nthings with Chin Peng, the discussions would go  on\r\n\r\nat least as long as Panmunjong, or possibly as long\r\n\r\nas the Emergency, because the number of words which\r\n\r\nhe would find to use would, I am afraid, extend the\r\n\r\ndiscussions beyond all bearable length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last bit of objection - perhaps a very minor\r\n\r\none - is that probably Chin Peng would object to  one\r\n\r\nof  the  inveterate  habits of the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party of putting  words  into  his\r\n\r\nopponent's mouth which his opponent has never said.\r\n\r\nHe  is  always doing it. He does it again and again\r\n\r\nbut  he  does not get away with it here because  we\r\n\r\nshoot  him down and say: \"Well, of course,  I  never\r\n\r\nsaid  anything of that sort at all.\" He then  makes\r\n\r\nhis little joke from the front Bench and the matter\r\n\r\npasses  over.  But  I think that  if  he  sat  down\r\n\r\nseriously with Chin Peng and try to argue with him,\r\n\r\nhe  would do the same sort of thing and get into  a\r\n\r\nfrightful  state of confusion and Chin  Peng  would\r\n\r\nnot  have known what he had said at the end  of  it\r\n\r\nall probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think he would be intolerably confused and again\r\n\r\nan  awful  lot of time would be wasted.  These  are\r\n\r\nvery minor matters, Mr Speaker, Sir. I do not want\r\n\r\nto  lengthen  this out at all, but I do  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  are really practical little objections  which\r\n\r\nshould be taken into account when considering  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I do not think it is  necessary  to\r\n\r\ncall your attention and the attention of others  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that I am one of the few old  men  in  a\r\n\r\nHouse  so full of young and brilliant men.
