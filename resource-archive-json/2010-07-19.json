Both started out as self-radicalised individuals and because they were unchecked, went on to establish links with terrorist groups which facilitated their bid to undertake militant jihad.&nbsp; Fortunately, in both cases, their bombing attempts were unsuccessful.&nbsp; Had they succeeded, the outcomes would have been horrific.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To counter the spread and influence of jihadist ideology in Singapore, we must take a multi-pronged approach.&nbsp; We must not allow radicals to spread their ideas here.&nbsp; Our mosques and other Islamic institutions must be vigilant, and keep a close watch on individuals who teach, preach or conduct activities at their premises. Foreign religious teachers and speakers need to obtain a letter of support from MUIS before the Ministry of Manpower will grant them an Employment Pass or a Work Pass to teach or give speeches on religion here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad Anwar Jailani&rsquo;s case has shown that attention must be paid to religious teachers who preach and instruct others.&nbsp; Local Islamic institutions and Muslims should only engage properly qualified teachers accredited under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme, which MUIS introduced in 2005.&nbsp; More and sustained publicity for this scheme is needed to raise awareness, so that Singaporeans know to check the list of accredited persons before engaging a religious teacher.&nbsp; MUIS will also explore <p align=left>Column: 618<p>other ways, including legal options, to ensure that Islamic institutions do not engage or allow unaccredited individuals to conduct religious activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISD has also worked with MDA to reach out to bookstores to ensure that they do not carry extremist literature, whether in paper or electronic form.&nbsp; These efforts will be stepped up and firm action against errant distributors and retailers will be taken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorists are increasingly exploiting the Internet as an effective means to propagate their radical ideology, promote their cause and recruit potential operatives.&nbsp; To extend their reach, their messages have been posted online in different languages, including English.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been suggestions that the Government should block these radical websites.&nbsp; However, this would be a futile exercise.&nbsp; The architecture and reach of the Internet make it practically impossible to interdict all radical websites.&nbsp; Moreover, there are several thousand such sites and the number continues to grow.&nbsp; If we bring down one website, it can easily resurface under another name or in another jurisdiction.&nbsp; To be effective, we would not only have to block terrorist websites but also popular social networking platforms like YouTube and Facebook, which would clearly not be practicable.&nbsp; The same Internet that empowers ordinary individuals unfortunately also serves radicals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we cannot expect to perfectly shield Singaporeans from exposure to jihadist ideology, education is critical to inoculate our society against jihadist ideology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many years now, ISD has held briefings and talks to schools and community groups, to share its concerns about radicalisation.&nbsp; The Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) too has used <p align=left>Column: 619<p>public talks, forums, media interviews and written articles to alert the general Muslim public to the falsehoods of jihadist ideology.&nbsp; Several other Muslim leaders and organisations have also initiated and organised community counter-ideology programmes.&nbsp; The common goal of these efforts is to help Singaporeans who chance across radical teachings in the guise of religion to see through the falsehood and not be led astray.&nbsp; These community efforts are a positive development and we hope even more community organisations and leaders will step forward to do likewise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Muslim Singaporeans who may be radicalised while pursuing studies overseas, MUIS will strengthen its capacity and resources to reach out to them, and hopefully convince them not to enrol in radical institutions where they are at risk of being subverted by radical ideas.&nbsp; This would include more measures to advise on the choice of schools, as many commentators in the media have suggested, and stationing officers overseas to keep in close touch with young Muslim Singaporeans studying there, to ensure that they are rightly guided, supported and remain connected to Singapore&rsquo;s development and contemporary issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans themselves must play their part to help loved ones turn away from the path of radicalisation.&nbsp; They must not turn a blind eye or be unwilling to heed warning signs.&nbsp; Fadil and Muhammad Thahir bin Shaik Dawood had let people close to them know that they were interested in militant jihad, and these people had noticed that they were surfing radical websites.&nbsp; However, none of them sought help from the religious or Government authorities.&nbsp; Instead, they brushed aside Fadil and Thahir&rsquo;s jihadist talk as not serious.&nbsp; Had they contacted the authorities at an earlier stage, things might have turned out quite differently for Fadil and Thahir, and the two of them <p align=left>Column: 620<p>might not have had to be detained or placed on Restriction Orders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early intervention is the best way to save a relative or friend from the road to radicalisation.&nbsp; It gives him the best chance to be guided back to the correct path.&nbsp; This is the socially and morally responsible thing to do; it should not be seen as betrayal, because such action helps both the individual and our society.&nbsp; We should not be paranoid.&nbsp; But as a community, we need to be discerning enough to distinguish mere \"viewpoints\" from \"something more sinister\", and have the moral courage to seek help from MUIS and the Government authorities when required.&nbsp; Not reporting suspicious warning signs could not only hurt innocent lives but also strain communal and familial relations if the individual becomes thoroughly radicalised and does something disastrous.&nbsp; Reporting warning signs is thus a necessary first step towards countering radicalisation in our midst, and I can assure you that no further action will be taken if it turns out to be a false alarm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as for the concern about disunity in the society and community, over the years since we uncovered the JI in 2001, Singaporeans &ndash; Muslims and non-Muslims alike &ndash; have stood together in our efforts against terrorism.&nbsp; Non-Muslim Singaporeans have not looked with suspicion at fellow Singaporean Muslims because they understand that the JI members and self-radicals are just a few misguided individuals.&nbsp; Muslim Singaporeans have also undertaken many proactive measures to address the problem of radicalisation.&nbsp; I believe that there is good reason to be confident that Singaporeans will be resilient and will continue to stand together against the ever-evolving terrorist threat.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister, for the comprehensive answer.&nbsp; My supplementary question is: are the <p align=left>Column: 621<p>radicalised individuals who have been arrested by the ISD this time merely just a few misguided individuals or is there a more deep-rooted problem in Singapore and how do we ensure that Singapore remains safe against the threat&nbsp;of terrorism?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I believe our Muslim community is moderate and not one where extremism freely thrives or is accommodated.&nbsp; However, what these recent arrests tell us is that notwithstanding this, there are individuals who may be&nbsp;susceptible to the dangers of radicalisation, and no society is immuned to this threat.&nbsp; Singapore, certainly, is no exception.&nbsp; We, therefore, cannot rule out the possibility of some Singaporeans being radicalised in future.&nbsp; There may also be already radicalised Singaporeans whom the security agencies are not aware of.&nbsp; The Home Team agencies will do their utmost to deal with the terrorist threat but there is no such&nbsp;thing as a perfect intelligence&nbsp;and enforcement system that can guarantee the detection of every threat and the prevention of every incident from occurring.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in America and the United Kingdom, with the deep commitment and&nbsp;the enormous&nbsp;resources post 9-11 to tackle the jihadist terrorist threat and with the numerous successes they have had in foiling several plots, some attacks still manage to get launched.&nbsp; In the UK, it was fortunate that perpetrators of the Glasgow Airport attack in 2007 were ultimately unsuccessful, like the Christmas Day airline plot last year and the Time Square bombing plot this year.&nbsp; They were unsuccessful because the devices&nbsp;failed to detonate as intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the case&nbsp;of the Fort Hood incident, the perpetrator&nbsp;successfully staged an attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives were lost and innocent people were hurt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 622<p>In Singapore, we have to be prepared for the possibility that one day, a terrorist could slip through our defences and carry out attacks in Singapore.&nbsp; This is the reason why we have worked hard at developing our consequence-management capabilities even as we strengthen our intelligence and defence efforts to prevent an incident through early detection.&nbsp; In addition, even though we already enjoy a level of communal harmony, which is treasured by all Singaporeans and which has been noted and commented on by many visitors, we do not take this for granted and assume that an attack will never take place in Singapore which will affect our social cohesion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why we started a community engagement programme in 2006 to build networks of trust among the communities in order to shore up our resilience.&nbsp; Within our community, we are also fortunate to have our Muslim religious leaders who are rational and sensible and who have the moral courage and conviction to speak up against jihadist terrorism.&nbsp; This is most apparent with the members of the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG).&nbsp; These members have actually interviewed and met the JI detainees and they understand fully the threat of terrorist doctrines and their implications on religious harmony and the security of Singapore if these are unchecked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Muslim religious leaders, whether it is in the RRG or other groups must together work with MUIS to press on to enhance the protection of the vulnerable members of our Muslim community from radicalisation.&nbsp; Our Muslim leaders have been and must continue also to be united against this fight.&nbsp; Unlike some other countries where it is difficult to find a unified voice among the Muslim leaders because of the different groups' interests, our Muslim leaders have shown, time and again, a commitment to the common good not just for the well-being of the Muslim community but they also understand fully <p align=left>Column: 623<p>the interests of the wider community and&nbsp;the national interests of Singapore, which they are a part of.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, truly hope that Singaporeans will never have to experience the pain of a terrorist attack but if we should ever face such an attack, then we should ensure that we are prepared and that our sober and balanced responses as a society ensure that we are resilient and able to recover from such an attack.&nbsp; How we react to an attack as a people is crucial because the injury that a terrorist&nbsp;incident inflicts on a society is deepest and long-lasting when it permanently scars communal relations with mistrust and animosities.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

From what we know, teachers and principals have no issue about contacting the security agencies to tell them about the concerns that they have and seek help from the authorities who will then talk to the individual students concerned.&nbsp; The same thing applies to&nbsp;the workplace,&nbsp;the employers' organisations, and so on.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 625<p>These are the efforts that have been going on for many years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for the media, we have also worked closely with the media, particularly with some of the journalists covering such stories, to help them understand the seriousness of a threat like this to us and in the event of a successful attack, how then do we deal with this as a community.&nbsp; Because how the press reports an incident very much affects how the people react to it subsequently.&nbsp; So we need all segments of a community to be involved, and this effort will carry on.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, from the cases of those radicalised by external teachers who preach militant jihad, whether&nbsp;there is a profile of Singaporeans who are vulnerable to such influences and whether their radicalisation is linked not only to external influences but also internal developments in the country and their community such as unhappiness with certain policies, their lot in life or their circumstances.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wong Kan Seng</B>:&nbsp; I think it will be simplistic for me to just outline a profile and then people say, \"Okay, I will try to recognise these individuals when I see them\".&nbsp; To do so will be to mislead people and sometimes we may let our guard down when we see certain signs which may not appear right but it does not seem to fit the profile that I have outlined.&nbsp; Having said that, let me say that from the cases that we have investigated, radicalisation actually cuts across all groups&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;gender, ethnicity, educational qualifications, socio-economic background, and so on.&nbsp; Foreign cases also reflect the same kind of traits.&nbsp; That said,&nbsp;we have also noticed that many of the radicalised Singaporeans are actually weak in their religious grounding.&nbsp; Therefore, they want <p align=left>Column: 626<p>to seek out what they think&nbsp;is the correct ideology and, unfortunately, they went to the wrong places or talked to the wrong people and therefore they cannot discern what is right or what is wrong.&nbsp; And when they do not seek the correct guidance from recognised <I>azatisahs</I> or religious teachers, then certainly they will face more issues and also pose problems to the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Muhammad Fadil, for example, he is no different from other JI members, even though he is self-radicalised.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the groups that we arrested over the years from 2002 onwards, he is just like any other person of these groups that have been radicalised.&nbsp; We know that from the groups that we detained, there are young people like Fadil,&nbsp;there are also middle-aged people, and there are also those in their 30s.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the younger people, their vulnerability can also be borne out by the youthful idealism that they may have, coupled with an inability to reason and to question the information given to them.&nbsp; As a&nbsp;result, they are unable to tell what is the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of how we can prevent radicalisation, as I have said, we can try to keep out radical influences through measures like education, community vigilance, counter-ideological talks, and so on.&nbsp; But there is no perfect shield that can prevent Singaporeans from being influenced by radical ideology.&nbsp; If a person looked at the wrong places, talked to the wrong people, they may get radicalised.&nbsp; Increasingly, because of the use of the Internet, some individuals get radicalised without others knowing about it or with very few people knowing about it, and that is where it is important for family members and their friends to tell the authorities, MUIS or religious teachers about such a change in behaviour of a person, so that things can be done to help the person not to get onto the wrong path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><p align=left>Column: 627<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

a concern that arises as a result of these incidents is an erosion of trust between people of different religious groups that could lead to finger-pointing or even victimisation.&nbsp; How does the Government monitor these developments?&nbsp;

<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng</B>:&nbsp; Sir, over the years, after the various detentions that have been conducted or made against JI members as well as other groups like the pro-MILF type, and the self-radicalised cases since 2007, we have been in very close touch with the community leaders, not only the religious leaders and the Muslim leaders but also community leaders of all ethnic groups, and also those in the business, unions, and so on.&nbsp; We also get feedback from members of the public, through REACH, and also through the press and the grassroots network, and also through direct interactions.&nbsp; From there, we have a sense that generally Singaporeans are quite balanced in their response to any arrest that we have made so far.&nbsp; The more information we share with the leaders, the better they understand the problems and, therefore, the better they are able to lead their community and&nbsp;to respond and deal with such issues.&nbsp; And Singaporeans understand that the Muhammad Fadil's case, as well as the other radicalised cases, is just an isolated case not representative of the whole community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in my main answer, the great majority of our Muslims are moderate and they are part of Singapore, part of our community and we have social cohesion over the years.&nbsp; So they understand that very well.&nbsp; Therefore, whenever we come across individuals <p align=left>Column: 628<p>who may have other views,&nbsp;we try to understand what is it that they are concerned about, in what way we can address them and therefore try to deal with those issues on a private basis, which is much better. &nbsp;If the issue has been taken out, then we discuss it openly.&nbsp;

They have confronted Singapore since our early days of nation-building.&nbsp; The Government has on several occasions discussed them&nbsp;in this House as well as with&nbsp;Malay community leaders.&nbsp; Over the years, we have&nbsp;been able to all&nbsp;work together in an honest, realistic and practical manner to make progress together as fellow Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a microcosm of Singapore society, and race relations within the SAF reflect those in our broader society.&nbsp; Thus as Singapore has made steady progress <p align=left>Column: 630<p>towards racial and religious integration, so has the SAF.&nbsp; Malays serve today in many more places and roles in the SAF than before &ndash; in the Commandos, Engineers, Artillery, and as Pilots and Sea Soldiers.&nbsp;As Malay educational standards have improved, a higher proportion of Malay&nbsp;enlistees are fulfilling the educational prerequisites to be selected for commanders&rsquo; training.&nbsp; Indeed, more Malays are now serving their full-time national service as commanders. And among our regular Malay servicemen, some have risen&nbsp;to hold senior and sensitive Command and Staff appointments.&nbsp; In each case, it is because the individual serviceman has the required qualifications and merit, and is the most suitable person for the job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in an age of jihadist terrorism, race and religion remain salient issues.&nbsp; Events around the world as well as continuing incidents in our immediate neighbourhood remind us that it will be a long time before the threat from jihadist terrorism subsides.&nbsp; Singapore &ndash; including the SAF &ndash; will need to watch this international context, and continue to manage our own racial and religious issues sensitively and pragmatically so as to safeguard our racial and religious harmony.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>The SAF will not let individual incidents, in particular those which impinge on sensitive racial and religious areas, cause distrust or suspicions among us, and negate the progress we have so painstakingly made.&nbsp; When we acknowledge the real problems that&nbsp;we face and tackle them together sincerely and practically, we can strengthen understanding, trust and confidence among our communities in Singapore, and thus make further progress together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our best approach is for the SAF to decide on appointments and advancements based on qualifications and merits of the servicemen&nbsp;so long as they are committed to Singapore, dedicated to the SAF, and capable of doing the job. By <p align=left>Column: 631<p>assessing each person according to these criteria, we can recognise the commitment, contributions and abilities of our servicemen, who come together to serve in the defence of our nation.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RECENT FLASH FLOODS IN SINGAPORE--><p align=left>Column: 631<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RECENT FLASH FLOODS IN SINGAPORE:::650--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>RECENT FLASH FLOODS IN SINGAPORE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <B>&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah</B> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources<br>&nbsp;in view of the flash floods which occurred in parts of Singapore on 16th June 2010 (a) what caused the floods; (b) how often does PUB check on the maintenance of the drains; (c) what is the design capacity of our drainage system especially in the city area; and (d) what is the process for PUB to monitor the adequacy of the drainage system for various locations in view of the constant building redevelopment in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I thank the Members for their questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years, the Government has invested some $2 billion to upgrade our drainage infrastructure.&nbsp; PUB will continue to implement new drainage works to reduce the severity and incidence of floods in Singapore.&nbsp; In planning our drainage infrastructure, PUB takes into account the expected flow from surface runoff based on the size of the catchment area, the history of rainfall intensity and the different types of land surfaces in the catchment.&nbsp; The impact of planned land developments in the future is also worked into the drainage design considerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our building development control measures, PUB stipulates drainage requirements for effective flood prevention such as minimum platform and crest levels for buildings and entrances to underground facilities.&nbsp; This inter-agency process is well-established, involving PUB, HDB, URA, JTC and LTA to ensure that long-term development plans incorporate the necessary drainage requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that our drains are free-flowing and perform to their designed capacities, a comprehensive maintenance regime is in place. Contractors are <p align=left>Column: 634<p>deployed island-wide to check and clear debris from the drains.&nbsp; Their work, under a performance-based contract, is closely monitored by PUB to ensure that they meet the specified cleanliness standards and frequency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To alleviate the risk of flooding in low lying areas&nbsp;in the city, the Marina Barrage has been in operation since 2008.&nbsp; It has served to remove tidal influence at the Stamford Canal outlet.&nbsp; During heavy rain, up to&nbsp;nine gates and&nbsp;six pumps at the barrage will be operated to discharge excess storm-water to the sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Members can see from the chart* which has been distributed, through concerted effort and careful land development planning, flood prone areas have been reduced from 3,200 hectares (ha) in the 1970s to 66 ha today.&nbsp; After the recent flooding, we will review the list of flood prone areas.&nbsp; We continue to take a serious view of flooding incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they occur, PUB will assess the cause of the flood and, if necessary, work with other agencies to improve the drainage system and raise the road levels.&nbsp; PUB also engages building owners on appropriate flood protection measures to prevent a recurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on 16th June 2010, 100 millimetres (mm) of rain fell in&nbsp;two hours over the Stamford Canal catchment area.&nbsp; Orchard Road (between Cuscaden Road and Cairnhill Road) was the worst-hit, with a flood depth of 300 mm.&nbsp; The floods subsided within an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB has completed the investigation of the flood incident at Orchard Road.&nbsp; The investigation found that the flood was caused by an intense storm that moved quickly along the Stamford Canal catchment from upstream to downstream in&nbsp;two bursts, 30 minutes apart.&nbsp; At 9.40 am, the first intense burst of rainfall fell over the upstream portion of the Stamford <p align=left>Column: 635<p>Canal catchment.&nbsp; The runoff from this initial rainfall flowed down the canal.&nbsp; When it reached the middle section of the canal (from Cuscaden Road to Grange Road), it coincided with the runoff from the second burst of rain which fell over the entire catchment at 10.10 am.&nbsp; This generated a combined storm flow that caused the water level to rise rapidly and overflow onto Orchard Road.&nbsp; The situation was worsened by debris carried into the canal by the first burst of rain.&nbsp; The findings of this investigation were shared with an independent expert review panel, comprising both local and international experts.&nbsp; The experts concurred with PUB&rsquo;s findings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that morning, PUB responded swiftly to the impending storm, and cooperated closely with the Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority, Singapore Civil Defence Force, National Environment Agency and MediaCorp Radio.&nbsp; At 8.30 am, prior to the heavy rains, PUB staff and contractors were deployed to anticipated hotspot areas prone to flash floods.&nbsp; The gates at the Marina Barrage were operated progressively from 8.30 am onwards to allow excess storm-water to flow to the sea.&nbsp; When the flood occurred at Orchard Road around 10.30 am, PUB worked with the Traffic Police and SCDF to render assistance to the public.&nbsp; At noon, shortly after the flood subsided, tankers and pumps were deployed to assist in pumping floodwater out from affected premises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has studied the investigation findings by PUB on the flood incident&nbsp;in Orchard Road, and we agree with the findings.&nbsp; I am also satisfied that the response by PUB and the other agencies was consistent with the standing procedures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PUB has since engaged the managing agents of affected premises in <p align=left>Column: 636<p>Orchard Road as well as the Orchard Road Business Association to recommend early warning systems and structural measures to limit the impact of flash floods on premises.&nbsp; These measures include flood barriers and road humps to protect basement car parks.&nbsp; Building owners and managing committees have also been encouraged to improve their communication and evacuation procedures as part of their emergency response plans for flood incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, PUB has invited the businesses to participate in its SMS alert system so that they will be alerted of high water levels detected by sensors in Stamford Canal.&nbsp; We will look into extending this alert system to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB will also be making the data from its water level sensors available to the public on a website.&nbsp; The existing network of 32 water level sensors will be expanded to 90 sensors by the end of the year and to 150 next year.&nbsp; PUB is also working with the Traffic Police to put up more signboards to warn motorists of flooded roads to avoid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;on 25th June 2010, 100 mm of rain fell within 1.5 hours.&nbsp; Unlike what happened on 16th June 2010, the rain was widespread over the whole of Singapore resulting in localised floods in several areas such as Bukit Timah, Thomson, Little India, Kampong Java, Newton and Bedok.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th July 2010, just last Saturday, there was another heavy and intense rainfall over Singapore, causing floods over the central and eastern parts of Singapore.&nbsp; In the early morning, about 181 mm and 194 mm of rain was recorded in the central and eastern areas of Singapore respectively.&nbsp; This is more than the average total monthly rainfall of 158 mm for July.&nbsp; Some of the locations flooded included Bukit Timah, Newton, Orchard Road, Telok Kurau and Jalan Taman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 637<p>Most of the affected areas on both 25th June 2010&nbsp;and 17th July 2010 were known flood prone areas.&nbsp; Similar to that on 16th June 2010, the runoff from the intense rain caused Stamford Canal to overflow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On these occasions, PUB, together with Traffic Police and SCDF officers, was onsite to render assistance to those affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PUB has an ongoing drainage improvement programme to improve the drainage in many of these areas.&nbsp; Previous flood prone areas, such as Joan Road, were not affected as a result of completed drainage projects in the area.&nbsp; There are plans to implement drainage improvements to several major canals and drains.&nbsp; The tender for improvement to Geylang River closed in June and tenders for improvements to Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal and the downstream stretch of Rochor Canal&nbsp;will be called in the next&nbsp;three months. Tenders for the upgrading of major drains along Thomson Road and MacPherson Road will be also called by the end of this year.&nbsp; Works to improve the drainage system in the flood prone areas of Little India will start in the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, we will bring forward the start of these works and expedite their completion.&nbsp; We are also undertaking an urgent review of the Stamford Canal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these storm events, downtown areas like Marina Centre and Chinatown were not affected as the Marina Barrage was operated effectively to avert further flooding.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Miss Penny Low and Ms Irene Ng have asked if these recent cases are evidence of global warming and climate change, and whether we are prepared for <p align=left>Column: 638<p>this.&nbsp; There is a wide range of variability in rainfall in our region &ndash; within this year so far, we have experienced both intense rainfall and the driest February on record.&nbsp; Although we cannot conclusively link these events to climate change, I would like to assure&nbsp;Members that we are aware of the challenge of climate change and are closely monitoring long-term rainfall trends in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better understand Singapore&rsquo;s long-term vulnerabilities to climate change, NEA commissioned a study involving both local and foreign experts.&nbsp; The study projects that the average daily temperature could increase by between 2.7<sup>o</sup> C to 4.2<sup>o</sup>C from the current average of 26.8<sup>o</sup> C, and the mean sea level around Singapore could rise by 24 cm to 65 cm, by 2100.&nbsp; As climate science is a complex and evolving subject, we will continue to improve our understanding as more information and data become available and climate change models become more robust.&nbsp; This will allow us to incorporate the latest scientific understanding on the potential impact of climate change into our infrastructure planning considerations.&nbsp; NEA is also working to expand its capabilities in climate science through collaborations with renowned climate institutes and the World Meteorological Organisation.&nbsp; In the longer term, we will put in place additional measures as needed to adapt to the potential impact of climate change.&nbsp; MND leads an inter-agency Adaptation Taskforce to review the sufficiency of Singapore&rsquo;s existing adaptation measures and to identify the additional measures that need to be implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the incidence of flash floods is a challenge faced by cities around the world.&nbsp; Recently, devastating floods in France, China and Japan inflicted significant damage and loss of lives.&nbsp; As an island in the tropics, Singapore is especially prone to intense rain storms.&nbsp; We have seen the occurrence of&nbsp;three <p align=left>Column: 639<p>intense rainfall events over the past month, caused by Sumatra squalls and the influence of Typhoon Conson, and aggravated by the prevailing La Nina conditions.&nbsp; Climate change could add a new level of complexity to this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I empathise with the frustration and anxiety of those affected by the recent floods.&nbsp; PUB officers will continue to hold dialogues with affected residents and businesses, and advise on possible improvement measures that they can take.&nbsp; We will also look into improving our alert system to provide early warning of possible floods to the public.&nbsp; Although it might not be realistic to expect Singapore to be completely flood free, my Ministry will work with the relevant agencies to carry out a systematic review of all major drainage systems and their design parameters, as a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp; The review is expected to take several months, and all possible interventions will be considered within the constraints of cost effectiveness and competing uses for limited land in Singapore.&nbsp;</p></div></span><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:&nbsp;</B> Sir, the frequency of checks of our drains prior to the incident of 16th June was every three months and that was adequate.&nbsp; But obviously the 16th June's storm was an intense storm that caused a lot of rubbish to be pushed down to the Stamford Canal and caused some parts of the canal to be blocked.&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided, in the interest of alleviating as&nbsp;much as possible&nbsp;flood-prone areas, to increase our frequency of cleaning blocked drains.&nbsp; So it is not an acknowledgement that something has gone wrong but it is something that&nbsp;needed to be learnt as we go along and maybe these are the ways in which we can improve the work that we do.&nbsp; To the second question on the exact role of the Marina Barrage &ndash; the Marina Barrage is supposed to be 3-in-1.&nbsp; First of all is to <p align=left>Column: 648<p>create a freshwater reservoir for ourselves, second is really flood alleviation and third is&nbsp;for recreational uses.&nbsp; On the flood alleviation measures, as rightly pointed out, it is meant to alleviate flood in low-lying&nbsp;city areas.&nbsp; In fact, in the incident of 16th June and even last Saturday, the nine crest gates were opened progressively to allow the storm water to flow into the sea.&nbsp; But how the crest gates and the pump are operated would have to be decided by the water level, both inside the reservoir and outside,</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>because if the water level outside is higher, and it is high tide, then you have to start the pumps and pump the water out. If it is lower, we can lower the crest gates. The trigger point has to be done carefully and this will take some time. If we do open up the crest gates, we have to ensure that we do it correctly. PUB had done this correctly in the last three incidents, and because of that, none of the areas downtown had any flood. As to whether or not we could have done it for the Orchard&nbsp;Road&nbsp;area, I would like to inform Members that we did but do not forget the Marina Catchment is a very large catchment. In the case of Orchard Road, the canals are all the way upstream and it may not have enough capacity or even ability to drain off the water as quickly as possible. At the end of the day, this has to be studied as a system, not just as a barrage, together with all the drains on how we can do this. As I mentioned earlier, the Stamford Canal is now our priority, we will study this carefully on how, together with the system that we put in place, we can alleviate the hotspots that we have discovered in Orchard Road.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, one supplementary question.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, the early warning system we have is an SMS-system that is triggered using the water sensors that we have in our canals. We monitor the water level of our canals on time. When it reaches a certain level, we basically trigger the alarm to inform agencies such as the Police, SCDF and others to be on high alert. We would extend this alert system to&nbsp;the businesses affected.&nbsp;We are now studying whether we can extend this to the public, because it just involves an SMS. We would ensure that people who are in the low-lying areas, if there is an incident that is about to happen, we are able to inform them so that they can take the necessary measures. But the point is that all of this is not an exact&nbsp;science because the water level would have to&nbsp;reach a certain level, based on our judgement, for us to trigger the alert. As to whether flooding will occur or not, it is not possible for us to say with 100% certainty. But, at least, I think the whole&nbsp;point is&nbsp;that the businesses can do something. If there is no flooding, it is okay. If there is a flood, they are able to save their properties. We would study this system in a more comprehensive manner to extend it to members of the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, as&nbsp;I mentioned in my reply, we would extend the number of sensors, from 32 to 150 eventually. We would put all of the&nbsp;level of&nbsp;the sensors on&nbsp;PUB's website. Even if you are not on the alert system, you can go to the PUB website and see the water levels in real time. &nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, my question is related to what the Member has just asked.

Despite the construction of the <p align=left>Column: 650<p>drainage system in the area, we are still experiencing floods in that area. I would like to ask the Minister: even with the enhancement to the drains, canals and so on, would Bukit Timah ever be taken off the flood-prone area list? Or can it be less flood-prone than what it is today?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, honestly, no Minister can ever give the Member the answer. [<I>Laughter</I> ]. It is difficult for us to say as to whether or not we can make it entirely flood-free. I was reminded by senior Members of the Cabinet that Bukit Timah&nbsp;was known&nbsp;to be a&nbsp;flood-prone area in the 1960s and&nbsp;1970s. But if you look at the chart, the PUB has been very successful in reducing the numbers of flood-prone areas, including areas in Bukit Timah. But, obviously, more needs to be done and we will do our best.&nbsp; We cannot look at the control of floods just purely from the drainage system. The idea of protecting yourself, warning yourself early that a flood may occur, what you can do &ndash; is an important part of the challenge. So it is both trying to give you early warning so that you can do something, and on&nbsp;the part of the PUB to increase the drainage system as much as possible to drain off the water into the sea as quickly as possible. So we will do our best,&nbsp;expand the drainage and the canals that we have in Bukit Timah. At the same time, it is better for us to work with the condominiums and businesses around the area to bring them&nbsp;into this&nbsp;early warning system, and to&nbsp;play a part to prevent flooding from occurring in their own developments. &nbsp;As&nbsp;mentioned by Mr Christopher de Souza earlier, some of&nbsp;the condominiums' management will&nbsp;probably have to make&nbsp;a decision as to&nbsp;whether they want to&nbsp;implement some of the flood prevention measures that we have advised them to do so. These are the things that we can continue to do together to&nbsp;ensure that we can minimise the impact of flooding if it occurs again at Bukit Timah. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SAFETY OF FOREIGN WORKERS ON LORRIES--><p align=left>Column: 651<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SAFETY OF FOREIGN WORKERS ON LORRIES:::658--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SAFETY OF FOREIGN WORKERS ON LORRIES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Reasons for recent accidents and review of safety measures--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Reasons for recent accidents and review of safety measures)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. &nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza</B> asked the Minister for Transport in light of the deaths of&nbsp;three foreign workers arising from an expressway accident on 22nd June 2010 (a) what measures will be implemented to ensure the safety of foreign workers being transported to and from work on their employers' vehicles; (b) how will these measures help minimise injury and how quickly will they be implemented; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider legislating that employers must transport their workers in mini buses or buses with compulsory seat-belting.&nbsp;<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14. &nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> asked the Minister for Transport (a) if the recently introduced measures to enhance the safety of workers transported on lorries should be effected sooner instead of the phased approach; (b) whether the deadline for compulsory installation of higher side-rails on existing lorries should be brought forward rather than wait till 2012; (c) whether the current number of buses/minibuses is sufficient to meet the transportation needs of the industry; and (d) whether the Ministry will consider supporting businesses who wish to convert to bus transportation in the near future by providing incentives/subsidies.&nbsp;<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15. &nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider bringing forward the deadline for introducing new safety measures for the transport of workers on lorries that were supposed to be introduced by 2012; (b) what enforcement action will be taken against errant employers who fail to comply with safety rules when transporting workers; and (c) what are the immediate steps taken to provide better protection to <p align=left>Column: 652<p>workers pending the introduction of new safety measures.&nbsp;<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</B> asked the Minister for Transport (a) if the Ministry will consider bringing forward the proposed measures to have higher protective side railings and canopies for lorries which will only take effect in 2012; and (b) whether there are plans for interim measures such as public education for transport operators who ferry workers.&nbsp;<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min</B> asked the Minister for Transport (a)&nbsp;what are the underlying reasons for the spate of accidents involving foreign workers transported in lorries; and (b) whether the speed limit for vehicles used in transporting workers can be further reduced to make travelling on these vehicles safer.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> Sir, with your permission, can I take Question Nos.&nbsp;13 to 17 together as&nbsp;they are related to the same matter?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker:</B> Okay.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an issue that the Government takes seriously. Last year, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck explained in this House that the safety measures in place and enforcement efforts have generally been effective in keeping the fatality and injury rates of passengers carried at the back of lorries low. Nonetheless, a workgroup led by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Ministry of Manpower&nbsp;(MOM) recommended a series of measures to further enhance the safety of workers transported on lorries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the measures were implemented on 1st September 2009 and 1st January 2010. Enforcement records showed there has generally been a high <p align=left>Column: 653<p>level of compliance to these safety rules. There has been on average a 50% fall in the number of violations of these rules in the first four months of this year, compared to the last four months of last year. The accident statistics during the 10-month period before and after the new measures were implemented show that the injury cases have reduced by about 17%. However, for fatality cases, it is too early to draw conclusions given the very small numbers involved, with three cases for the 10 months before 1st September 2009, and three cases for the 10 months after, all of which happened on the unfortunate 22nd June accident.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two remaining measures from the workgroup recommendations that we had planned to implement on 1st September 2012.&nbsp; They are: first, all lorries used to ferry workers must be fitted with canopies and higher side railings. This has been a requirement for all newly-registered lorries since 1st January 2010, and was to be extended to existing lorries on 1st September 2012. Second, the minimum deck space requirement per seated worker will be doubled from&nbsp;four to&nbsp;eight square feet. A longer lead time was given to these two measures to allow businesses to phase in their operational changes and make decisions on their existing assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the fatal lorry accident on 22nd June, LTA has reviewed the situation and identified&nbsp;four areas through which to further enhance the safety of workers on lorries. They are:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) vehicle-safety related measures,</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) driver-related measures,</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) enforcement and penalties, and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) public education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 654<p> On vehicle-safety related measures, Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mdm Halimah Yacob and Dr Lim Wee Kiak have asked whether these remaining two measures should be brought forward. We have decided that it would be prudent to do so, and it will be done as follows:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) All light lorries used to transport workers will have to be fitted with canopies and higher side railings within the next&nbsp;six months, that is, by 1st February 2011. Heavy lorries used to transport workers will need to comply by 1st August 2011.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) The doubling of the minimum deck space requirement per seated worker to&nbsp;eight square feet will be implemented for both light and heavy lorries by 1st August 2011.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement for canopies and higher side railings is being phased in as there are capacity constraints in our local workshops. We have looked at the accident statistics which show that 75% of lorry accidents resulting in fatalities to workers involve light lorries. Also, light lorries, as compared to heavier lorries, are generally less able to withstand the forces of collisions in an accident. As such, we have put priority for light lorries to be retrofitted first.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the vehicle safety-related measures which would help minimise the extent of injuries when accidents do occur, the drivers also play a crucial role in transporting the workers safely. The Traffic Police (TP) already has a strict enforcement regime and penalty framework against errant drivers who speed, drive recklessly or dangerously. In response to Dr Lam Pin Min&rsquo;s suggestion on reducing the speed limit of lorries which transport workers, it is not recommended as it will increase the speed differential between lorries and other vehicles on expressways and this will <p align=left>Column: 655<p>itself give rise to other safety issues. Our focus should be on ensuring that drivers keep to the existing speed limits and drive safely. Hence, besides enforcement which I will touch on shortly, LTA and TP will explore the use of technologies and devices to better control speeding by lorries used for carrying workers. Also, to ensure that foreign drivers who ferry workers or goods in the course of their work are fully competent and familiar with driving on our roads, the Ministries of Home Affairs and Manpower will develop and implement more stringent conditions for licensing these drivers. The details on these measures will be announced when they are ready.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA and TP have also stepped up their enforcement efforts and will continue to take strict enforcement action against errant drivers. Resources will be increased to sustain the stepped-up level of enforcement. Penalties for speeding and non-compliance with vehicle safety rules will be enhanced with higher fines as well as demerit points for greater deterrence. In addition, appropriate legal actions will be taken against both the employers and the drivers depending on the nature of the offence. The details will be announced in due course.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA, TP and MOM, together with industry stakeholders, will continue public education efforts on road safety as well as develop targeted programmes such as safety talks, videos and posters for various stakeholder groups to raise awareness of the safety regulations for lorries carrying workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr de Souza has asked whether the Ministry will consider legislating that employers must transport their workers in buses. The measures that are in place, and to be effected in the next year, would help to achieve the desired objective of mitigating the risks of workers who need to travel on lorries in the course of their work. We should allow the measures to <p align=left>Column: 656<p>improve workers&rsquo; safety on lorries to take effect and study their effectiveness before concluding that they are insufficient and going for a ban.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The efforts put in by all the relevant agencies underscore the Government&rsquo;s concern about the safety of workers transported on lorries. Employers and drivers must also play their part as safety is also their responsibility as well.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister particularly for agreeing to bring forward the deadline for implementing the two measures as well as the various other measures that he has mentioned. I certainly feel that that would somehow help in improving the safety for workers being transported in lorries. However, I do have three questions for the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to ask Minister when the stringent licensing conditions for the foreign drivers will&nbsp;be introduced. &nbsp;I think that is an important consideration. Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry would&nbsp;consider other than the measures already mentioned, making it a requirement for these lorries to install safety belts so as to further minimise injuries and deaths. Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he could also impose the same deadline of six months for the measures to kick in, with regard to the heavy vehicles, rather than make a distinction between light and heavy lorries.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> On the Member&rsquo;s first question on when the stringent licensing regime will come in place, this is something which the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Home Affairs are currently working on. They will announce it when ready but they are studying this carefully. On whether we could put in safety belt for lorries, the workgroup actually studied and considered this and consulted safety <p align=left>Column: 657<p>experts on this. But the conclusion was if we were to put safety belts for lorries which were supposed to carry goods, it might actually create other safety issues, and cause different types of injuries to those being carried. His last question was whether we could impose the same six months timeline for heavy lorries. We studied this.&nbsp; It is really a question of capacity. If we could, we would have done it but we are trying to do the bulk.&nbsp; So about 60% will be done in six months and the remainder, a little later or few months later.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Mr Speaker, I echo Mdm Halimah Yacob's thanks to the Minister for Transport in bringing forward the deadlines. I think it shows the resolve the Ministry has in taking this matter seriously. The Minister mentioned penalties, and with that, the discussion on demerit points. But would the Minister consider a penalty to the employer if there is indeed a fatality or serious injury on the way to work, in terms that it may affect the quota or number of people he could employ in future?</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>When you pass a worksite, there is a billboard which says number of fatalities and the number of workers that are injured.&nbsp; Could we institute regulations so that employers will need to also display the number of workers that have been injured on the way to and from work on that billboard as a deterrent?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; The Member&rsquo;s question is&nbsp;about the penalty framework, whether or not it should also be applied to employers.&nbsp; This is something that we are looking at.&nbsp; I think I mentioned in my reply that it is not just penalties on the drivers but also on the employers because we recognise that sometimes the employers are equally culpable in the non-compliance of the safety rules.&nbsp; The Member's other suggestion <p align=left>Column: 658<p>was whether or not we are going to put up notice boards at worksites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza</B>:&nbsp; It is a worksite billboard which already exists.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; I will pass that suggestion to the Ministry of Manpower and they could have a look at&nbsp;whether or not this will act&nbsp;as another deterrent.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</B>:&nbsp; I thank the Minister for his reply to my Question.

Actually, the speed limit is now 60 kilometres per hour.&nbsp; I think that helps to reduce injuries to workers when there is a collision. The Member's other point is on insurance coverage.&nbsp; We now have a Workmen's Compensation Act, and I think that should be covered under the Act.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SECURITY AT TRAIN AND BUS DEPOTS--><p align=left>Column: 658<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SECURITY AT TRAIN AND BUS DEPOTS:::662--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SECURITY AT TRAIN AND BUS DEPOTS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18. &nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</B> asked the Minister for Transport in view of the recent breach of security at the SMRT depot (a) what is the Ministry doing to strengthen the security at all train and bus depots/interchanges; (b) what is the procedure for all train carriages/buses to be checked by the transport operators <p align=left>Column: 659<p>before they go into service each morning; and (c) why was the graffiti on the SMRT train not spotted and the train allowed to leave the depot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19. &nbsp;<B>Mr Baey Yam Keng</B> asked the Minister for Transport whether he will consider enhancing security measures at MRT train depots, benchmarked against those at Changi Airport, considering the relative number of passengers carried by a train and a plane.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;may I have your permission to take Question Nos. 18 and 19 together as they are related?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my Ministry takes a serious view of the breach of security at SMRT's Changi Depot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the incident, both public transport operators, SMRT and SBS Transit, have taken immediate steps to strengthen the security at their train and bus depots.&nbsp; Measures include the installation of more CCTV cameras and concertina wire along the perimeter fence of the train depots, increased security presence in terms of the numbers of guards and the frequency of patrols, and stepped up checks of both the interior and exterior of trains and buses before they depart for service.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the inter-agency Public Transport Security Committee (PTSC), chaired by the Chief Executive of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), is undertaking a comprehensive review of the security of our entire public transport system.&nbsp; The PTSC's review will take about&nbsp;six to&nbsp;eight months to complete.&nbsp; Through this system-wide review, we aim to address any security gaps and see to practical improvements that need to be made to enhance the security of Singapore's public <p align=left>Column: 660<p>transport system. In doing so, the PTSC considers international best practices, as well as those from other sectors, including Changi Airport.&nbsp; However, we should also bear in mind that there are differences in risk levels and ground practicalities between MRT train depots and Changi Airport. The PTSC would thus have to arrive at a set of recommendations best suited for our public transport network.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the graffiti was not spotted before the train left the depot, SMRT had explained that, prior to the incident, only the interior of train cabins were checked before the trains were launched into the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;This checking of MRT train interiors before leaving the depot and going into operation is part of the current procedures to ensure that MRT trains do not have any articles or items in them which could pose a security risk to commuters.&nbsp; Several SMRT staff had, in fact, noticed the graffiti but mistook it for an advertisement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This incident at Changi Depot serves as a timely reminder to all of us that are involved in ensuring security to remain vigilant at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that agencies learn lessons from this incident and take action to rectify the shortcomings.&nbsp; In doing so, we will continue to take a measured and risk-based approach towards security while not impairing the efficiency of our public transport system.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)</B>:&nbsp; I thank the Minister for his answer. I agree with the Minister that pragmatism should prevail and that it is&nbsp;also not possible to be fully&nbsp;foolproof, in terms of security measures, whether it is for MRT depots&nbsp;or at the&nbsp;Airport.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the PTSC or perhaps the Ministry to also consider the&nbsp;impact on the number of&nbsp;people, which&nbsp;I understand&nbsp;is about 1,600 passengers, coming&nbsp;on-board a MRT train <p align=left>Column: 661<p>versus an aeroplane which is about a few hundred passengers.

First, the Minister mentioned that after this incident, the two public transport operators (PTOs) are actually stepping up their depot security quite significantly by installing more cameras, conducting more patrols, etc. Does he not agree that up to now, perhaps, too light an approach has been taken on depot security?&nbsp; Second, does the Minister accept that the Government has an important oversight and regulatory role when it comes to public transport security? Third, I would like to ask the Minister who in the MOT or LTA is actually in charge of security, or is it MHA?&nbsp; Fourth, does the Ministry audit the security levels at the PTO sites?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; One of the Member's questions was: who looks after public transport security?&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, we have an inter-agency group, which is the Public Transport Security Committee (PTSC), chaired by the Chief Executive of LTA but he has all the relevant agencies in there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 662<p>As SMRT had acknowledged, there was a serious security lapse. That was why it had taken immediate steps to rectify this. The other question that she asked is on the role that the Government plays. I will just touch on this because&nbsp;a Question is coming up later.&nbsp; I think it is a shared responsibility when it comes to public transport security.&nbsp; The public transport operators have a primary responsibility like all business entities to ensure the security of their facilities, operations and that of their commuters.&nbsp; On the part of the Government, through the PTSC, it provides an overall security framework and coordinates the work of the various agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her final question is on whether we conduct audits. Yes, we do that. For instance, in all the bus interchanges and MRT stations, we constantly check this on a monthly basis to ensure that the security systems are in place and effective.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I have two further questions. Firstly, do&nbsp;the Government agencies conduct audits of depot security?

As for whether we conduct audits and checks, we review that constantly, whether it is for bus interchanges, depots or&nbsp;MRT stations.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SECURITY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT--><p align=left>Column: 663<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SECURITY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT:::666--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>SECURITY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Suspected terrorist plot on Orchard MRT station--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Suspected terrorist plot on Orchard MRT station)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20. &nbsp; <B>Ms Ellen Lee</B> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether his Ministry can provide more information on the suspected terrorist plot on Orchard MRT station; and (b) what his Ministry is doing to proactively respond to this threat besides the current measures already undertaken by LTA, SBS Transit, SMRT and the Police (including the Public Transport Security Command).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21. &nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim</B> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs what role does the Government play in ensuring that security on public transport is not compromised.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; You have four minutes, Mr Shanmugam.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)</B>:&nbsp; I will try, Sir, particularly as&nbsp;I have to take Question Nos. 20 and 21 together.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Indonesian authorities' raid on a militant&nbsp;training camp in Aceh in February this year gave some leads.&nbsp; Thereafter, a security operation was mounted against suspect Ahmad Sayid Maulana&nbsp;in East Jakarta in May. During the operation, the Indonesian authorities found the map showing our MRT network, where Orchard MRT station was circled, and also a street map of Orchard Road. This map is similar to those which are readily available from the Internet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An&nbsp;Internal Security Department&nbsp;(ISD) team went to Jakarta to discuss these findings with the Indonesian Police. I am <p align=left>Column: 664<p>not able to provide further details of our engagement for operational security reasons.&nbsp; However, I assure Members that we view this matter seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This discovery shows that, despite counter-terrorism successes by regional authorities, the terrorist threat in the region and to Singapore remains real. This should come as no surprise. Singapore has been targeted in the past, and continues to remain a trophy target. We cannot let our guard down.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligence and international cooperation remains an important component of our efforts. We work together with our foreign counterparts to apprehend terrorists,&nbsp;and restrict the ability of their networks to obtain financial support as well as plan and prepare for attacks. This collaboration underscores the strong cooperation and trust between the intelligence and security agencies in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond&nbsp;intelligence sharing, we have also been proactively developing capabilities to prepare ourselves for evolving security threats. One example is Singapore Police Force's Public Transport Security Command (TransCom) which was set up in August 2009 to enhance our ability to police the public transport network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the recent discovery, Police has stepped up high visibility patrols within Orchard MRT station and its vicinity. We have also reminded the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) to remain vigilant against possible terrorist threats. This is an addition to ISD's ongoing investigations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the security in the public transport sector. The PTOs bear primary responsibility for the day-to-day operational security of the premises and the environment in which they operate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the domain owners best placed to decide what measures are most <p align=left>Column: 665<p>feasible, taking into account the operating context and other considerations such as operational efficiency.&nbsp; This principle of domain owners bearing the responsibility for security in their respective domains is not new, and is the most practical and sustainable approach to ensuring our national security.&nbsp; The&nbsp;alternative is to have the Government everywhere and watching everything, but this is impossible, indeed not desirable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the provider of public transportation services, PTOs&nbsp;thus have first line responsibility for ensuring that the service they provide is safe.&nbsp; This includes safeguarding the public transport infrastructure, by implementing and maintaining appropriate security measures for the infrastructural assets, as well as carrying out their duty of care to protect the lives of their staff and the users of the public transport system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also plays a key role.&nbsp; It sets out the general security framework and the security standards (such as the Video Surveillance&nbsp;System standards) to be met by the PTOs. The&nbsp;Government sets the framework to examine security issues&nbsp;in a structured manner. The Government also brings together various stakeholders through platforms like the&nbsp;Public Transport Security Committee, (whose members comprise both the relevant Government agencies as well as the PTOs) to advise on security&nbsp;issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards security functions,&nbsp;the Government handles areas which cannot be handled by the PTOs. These&nbsp;security functions include intelligence gathering and collaboration with overseas law&nbsp;enforcement agencies. In addition, the&nbsp;Government also handles some aspects of operational security.&nbsp; It deploys Police personnel (such as TransCom officers) as needed by the&nbsp;threat environment to <p align=left>Column: 666<p>provide an additional layer of security, beyond the first level of security maintained by the PTOs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government and the PTOs&nbsp;thus have their respective roles to play in building an effective and&nbsp;strong partnership to secure a public transport network in Singapore. This partnership is vital, as it is a more practical and sustainable approach in the&nbsp;long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;In ensuring the safety and the security of the assets, operating premises, staff and customers, PTOs&nbsp;that have&nbsp;a strong security mindset are in fact protecting the continuity of their own business and making a longer-term investment.&nbsp; It is not just an expenditure with no returns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>3.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Order.&nbsp; End of Question time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ <I>Pursuant to Standing Order No. 22(3), Written Answers to Question Nos.&nbsp;22, 28-29, 34, 36, 40-41, 43-46, 48-51, 54 and 56-60 on the Order Paper are reproduced in the Appendix*.&nbsp; Question Nos.&nbsp;23-27, 30-33, 35, 37-39,&nbsp;42, 47, 52-53&nbsp;and 55 have been postponed to the next available sitting of Parliament.</I>]</p><p><br>&nbsp;<br></p></div></span><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS--><p align=left>Column: 666<p><P><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><strong>BILLS INTRODUCED</strong><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p></span></div></P>      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HOSTAGE-TAKING BILL--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HOSTAGE-TAKING BILL:::666--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>HOSTAGE-TAKING BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"to give effect to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages and for matters connected therewith and to make consequential amendments to the Banking Act (Chapter 19 of the 2008 Revised Edition) and the Penal Code (Chapter 224 of the 2008 Revised Edition).'.\"<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>presented by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs&nbsp; (Mr Wong Kan Seng); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 667<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL:::667--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Reading</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled \"An Act to amend the Housing and Development Act (Chapter 129 of the 2004 Revised Edition).\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill read the First Time.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Reading</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Second Reading, what day?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Today, Sir, immediately after the conclusion of proceedings on Item 1 of the Orders of the day.&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I lay upon the Table a&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in respect of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in respect of the&nbsp;Bill, laid upon the Table&nbsp;by the Minister.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> The Certificate is in order.

Tobacco contains more than 60 chemicals that are known to cause at least 20 forms of cancer. It also contains nicotine, which makes the user feel high, causes addiction and adversely affects the cardiovascular system potentially leading to higher risk for heart attacks and strokes. Despite these well-known risks, many smokers find it hard to quit and new smokers continue to join the ranks. The data is depressing. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, killing more than five million people every year worldwide. To different <p align=left>Column: 669<p>degrees of success, countries have tried to stem the tobacco epidemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore was a world pioneer in tobacco control. We were the first in Asia to ban advertising in 1971 and we have been aggressive in tobacco taxation. In 2004, we again led Asia by being the first to use graphic warnings on cigarette packs to deter smokers from lighting up. Last year, we were the first in the world to mark all duty-paid cigarettes sold here with the letters \"SDPC\", for \"Singapore duty paid cigarette\", as a means to combat cigarette smuggling. On efforts to get smokers to quit, the World Health Organization recognised only nine countries, including Singapore, for their nationwide network of smoking cessation services. As a result of these proactive efforts, our smoking prevalence, at below 14%, is among the lowest in the world.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International alliance in tobacco control is growing. In 2003, the World Health Organization (WTO)&nbsp;developed, what is called FCTC&nbsp;&ndash; Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to get its member states to adopt strategies and best practices aimed at reducing the demand for tobacco and regulating its supply. We signed the FCTC in 2004. Two obligations are now due for compliance: (a) imposing a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; and (b) extending health warning labels to the outer packaging, and prohibiting false and misleading packaging and labelling of tobacco products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) (CAST) (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the current Smoking (CAST) Act (Chapter 309 of the 2003 Revised Edition). The Bill will allow us to fulfil these obligations. In addition, I am using the opportunity to further tighten our tobacco control measures. There are two reasons for this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 670<p> First, smoking has increased in recent years, particularly among young adults. Between 2004 and 2007, smoking prevalence increased from 18% to 25% among young men, and 7% to 9% among young ladies. This is a cause for concern.&nbsp; Second, tobacco companies are fighting back, against the global smoking control measures, by introducing new and alternative tobacco products. Many of these products are designed to attract new tobacco users and marketed to especially appeal to the younger customers, including women. A recent article in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> explained vividly how a major tobacco multinational company was transforming into a company that offers a range of smokeless alternatives, such as strips, lozenges, snus and e-cigarettes. I brought along some samples.&nbsp; This is snus and it contains tobacco sachets and with instructions on how to use it&nbsp;&ndash; take one, put it under your tongue and enjoy it. This is a pack of e-cigarettes. \"e\" stands for electrical&nbsp;&ndash; you plug it in because you need the battery to light it up and they look like cigarettes. You have to unscrew it and these are batteries, you put it in and it releases nicotine and even lights up. And there are health warnings, \"smoking is harmful for health, e-cigarette is good for health.\" Many of these products closely resemble confectionary items. Clearly, the intent is for them to act as starter products that get young non-smokers addicted to nicotine.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should expect tobacco companies to want to maximise profits by seeking to grow their customer base. Governments must however be alert to this trend and do their best to protect the people, especially the young, from the unnecessary harm of tobacco and its substitutes. In Singapore, we have to ensure that our legislation and our control strategies keep pace with development in the tobacco industry. We intend to go as far and as fast as other countries in our <p align=left>Column: 671<p>tobacco control measures, for as long as they are practical and effective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the new provisions that are being introduced in this Bill.&nbsp; First, let me deal with our two outstanding obligations under the FCTC.</p><p><br><I>Tobacco sponsorship of the arts</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Act does prohibit tobacco advertising and promotion but it allows exemption for sponsorship of activities such as arts and cultural events. The Act allows tobacco companies to sponsor such events and activities and their sponsorship be publicly acknowledged. This exemption is in conflict with an obligation under the FCTC which imposes a fully comprehensive ban on all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The removal of section 3(2)(a) will allow us to remove this exemption clause. We have consulted the Ministry of Information, Communcations and the Arts (MICA) and they support this move. They have been building up alternative sources of sponsorship. We will give the arts organisations a grace period of up to the end 2010 before we remove the exemption clause.</p><p><br><I>Tobacco packaging</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Act requires graphic health warnings to be displayed on individual tobacco product packages sold here. The WHO FCTC, however, imposes an obligation to display graphic health warnings on all kinds of internal and external packaging. To meet this obligation, an amendment to section 17(1) will extend the display of graphic health warnings to outer packaging, such as the box or the carton that holds the individual packages for retail.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Tobacco labelling</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Act, we do not regulate on how tobacco companies label <p align=left>Column: 672<p>or brand their products. Some have used terms in their product packaging or labelling that may give the impression that their product or brand is less harmful to health or less addictive.&nbsp; Such terms include words like \"mild\" or \"light\". International and local studies found that consumers are misled by such terms. They believe that these products are less harmful and that switching to these products may help them to quit smoking, when in fact this is not so. There is no such thing as a safer cigarette; all cigarettes kill.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 17A will prohibit the importation, distribution, sale or offer for sale of any tobacco product that has or is accompanied by any false or misleading packaging or labelling. Such a prohibition will allow us to fulfil another obligation to the Convention and align ourselves with many other countries with similar prohibitions. The actual terms to be prohibited such as \"mild\" or \"light\" will be prescribed within the subsidiary legislation. We will give tobacco manufacturers a grace period of 12 months from the date of <I>Gazette</I> to effect the necessary changes.</p><p><br><I>New and emerging products</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me discuss the emergence of new and alternative tobacco products. As far back as 1993, the World Health Organization and several countries, including Singapore, had already expressed concern over new and emerging harmful tobacco products, and had recommended banning products&nbsp;&ndash; such as smokeless tobacco&nbsp;&ndash; that were becoming available. We amended the Act and, hence, section 15 of the current Act prohibits chewing tobacco and provides prescribing powers to prohibit other smokeless tobacco products for oral use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then tobacco companies have become even more aggressive and <p align=left>Column: 673<p>innovative, especially in recent years. Today, unconventional tobacco products come in various forms &ndash; smoked tobacco such as flavoured cigarettes; smokeless tobacco such as tobacco gels; dissolvable tobacco which resembles candy &ndash; this is particularly harmful because it can \"con\" the little kids; and tobacco substitutes such as e-cigarettes and even drinks like nicotine water.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new and emerging products are being marketed as safer alternatives to cigarettes but they are not.&nbsp; If they contain tobacco, whether they are smoked, chewed, inhaled, sucked or topically applied, then they are potentially harmful as tobacco is carcinogenic and causes cancer.&nbsp; If they contain nicotine, then they are still harmful as nicotine is toxic and highly addictive.&nbsp; There is a misconception that tobacco substitutes can be used as cessation aids when they have not been approved for such use.&nbsp; The nicotine level in some of these new and emerging products is actually higher than that in the cigarettes. With regular use, addiction can occur, leading to smoking and even dual use of both cigarettes and the substitutes.&nbsp; This is particularly observed in the west, as office workers find it very hard to smoke because most offices are now smoke-free.&nbsp; Here comes the smokeless alternative.&nbsp; During working hours, they take the smokeless products and when they go home, they take the real cigarettes.&nbsp; This is what the industry call \"dual usage\".</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has studied the evidence available internationally and locally, on the harm of tobacco use and nicotine addiction, and the appeal these new and emerging products may have to vulnerable groups, such as young people and young adults.&nbsp; The evidence is substantial.&nbsp; Almost all these new products have not yet reached our shores.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not be able to find them yet in Singapore.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 674<p>Hopefully it will never surface here.&nbsp; Let us take a pre-emptive step to ban them and prevent them from coming here and harming our people, especially the young.&nbsp; The amendment of section 15 will allow us to prohibit them.&nbsp; The proposed ban will cover these categories of new products:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) nasal and oral snuff, of which snus and smokeless cigarettes are sub categories;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) dissolvable tobacco, often referred to as \"tobacco pellets\" or \"tobacco candies\" and which may also come in strips and sticks;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) e-cigarettes and other nicotine-based cigarettes or similar which deliver nicotine but may not contain tobacco;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) tobacco and nicotine gels;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) nicotine water, drinks and food products; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) fruit and candy flavoured cigarettes and other tobacco products such as cigarillos, beedies and \"anghoon\".</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment to section 15 will also cover some future variations of emerging products by prescribing powers to the Minister for Health to allow prohibitions of future innovative products if they do not fit within the current categories. In making this amendment, we will not be alone.&nbsp; The proposed prohibitions are in line with bans already imposed in several countries including Australia, Canada and the European Union.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are taking the opportunity to make a number of technical amendments to improve the clarity of the Act and to enhance its implementation. They include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Clause 3 which amends the title of the Act from \"Smoking Control\", which is <p align=left>Column: 675<p>obviously outdated, to \"Tobacco Control\", as many new products are now smokeless;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Clause 4 which introduces new definitions for \"emission\", \"packaging\", \"premises\", \"tobacco product\", \"tobacco substitute\" and \"use\";</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Clause 6 which introduces the term \"services\" alongside \"goods\", to extend the coverage of prohibition to sales promotion of tobacco products;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Clause 8 which extends the prohibition of cigarettes sold in packs less than 20 units to miniature cigars or cigarillos.

Men are six times more likely to smoke than women. The age-specific male smoking prevalence exceeds 20% for all age groups from 18 to 69 years of age.&nbsp; There is also a&nbsp;significant racial difference.&nbsp; Malays' smoking prevalence is more than double that of Chinese or Indians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, our female smoking prevalence is low, at single digit percentage, except for young Malay ladies which stands at 14%.&nbsp; But more than half of women smokers are below 29 years old and their smoking rate has risen sharply from 5% in 1998 to 9% in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is irrefutable that smoking is detrimental to health.&nbsp; According to the World Health Organization, a person dies, on average, every six seconds from a tobacco-related illness.&nbsp; That is over 5 million people each year! &nbsp;They also stated that 50% of current tobacco users will die of a tobacco-related illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do smokers die early, they also deprive their families of income, raise the cost of health care, and hinder economic development.&nbsp; There are strong scientific evidences to link smoking to many serious ailments, such as heart diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease and cancers of the lungs, oral cavity and esophagus.&nbsp; Not only are the health of smokers affected by the habit, innocent bystanders, especially the family members, are also adversely <p align=left>Column: 678<p>affected by the second-hand smoke.&nbsp; Involuntary or second-hand smoke exposure can cause smoking-related diseases and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke.&nbsp; Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death, frequent respiratory infections and more severe asthma.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adverse effects of smoking have prompted many governments in the world, including Singapore, to mandate the prominent display of health warnings on cigarette packs.&nbsp; Singapore has led Asia by being the first to use graphic warnings depicting disease conditions such as lung and mouth&nbsp;ulcers to deter smokers from smoking in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, Singapore&nbsp;has become the first in the world to mark all duty-paid cigarettes sold here to combat cigarette smuggling.&nbsp; Yet with all these measures, the prevalence of smoking in Singapore remains significantly high enough to warrant tougher measures.&nbsp; Are we doing enough to tackle this long-term enemy?&nbsp; Should we learn from Bhutan, a small remote Himalayan nation, to address this long time public health concern?&nbsp; Bhutan went on an offensive war against tobacco with a total ban on smoking in public places and sale of tobacco products in 2005. The ban forbids people from lighting up at government offices, hospitals, schools, parks and shopping centres, among other places.&nbsp; With this new law, Bhutanese are, technically, allowed to smoke in their homes and can even import small quantities of tobacco for \"personal use\", though they will pay as much as 200% in customs duties and sales taxes for the pleasure. This predominantly Buddhist nation is thought to be the first country in the world to impose such a ban. The moves are part of the government's effort to make Bhutan a smoke-free nation.&nbsp; Do we see learning points from such a draconian initiative?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was adopted by <p align=left>Column: 679<p>the World Health assembly in May 2003 and entered into force in February 2005.&nbsp; The FCTC was developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic and aimed at reducing the demand for tobacco and regulating its supply.&nbsp; Singapore signed the FCTC in 2004 and has fulfilled its obligations, except on&nbsp;two where compliance is incomplete.&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification from the Minister the reasons for the failure to achieve full compliance since 2004 and whether this has contributed to the increase in smoking prevalence among the young adults in Singapore in the last&nbsp;five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The imposition of comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorship in this Bill serves to fulfil our obligations to FCTC.&nbsp; Whilst the current Act prohibits advertising and promotion, it allows tobacco companies to sponsor arts and cultural events with public acknowledgement on a case-by-case basis, as approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).&nbsp; The amended Act will eventually prohibit such sponsorships altogether.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, why should such sponsorship be disallowed if the&nbsp;publicity on the sponsorship is not acknowledged and will this contravene the WHO FCTC?&nbsp; Will the advertising ban also include tobacco companies putting up congratulatory or condolence messages for staff or business partners?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree totally with the Ministry's move to amend section 17(1) which mandates that the display of graphic health warnings be extended to the outer packaging, such as the box or carton that holds the individual packages.&nbsp; The new section 17A also prohibits the importation, distribution, sale of any tobacco product that has or is accompanied by any false or misleading packaging or labelling.&nbsp; Labels such as \"mild\" or \"light\" that give the impression to consumers that the product is less harmful will also be banned.&nbsp; A <p align=left>Column: 680<p>grace period of 12 months from date of <I>Gazette</I> will be given to tobacco companies to effect the necessary changes.&nbsp; This period, compared to the 30 months provided by the European Parliament and Council of European Union, seems rather short.&nbsp; How did MOH come up with this period of 12 months and is this time-frame adequate or realistic to ensure the industry compliance?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All smokers must be made to understand that the only safe thing to do is not to smoke at all.&nbsp; Whilst we rationalise that a complete ban may not be realistically possible, the Government's approach to maintain the twin-pronged strategy of preventing initiation and encouraging cessation is an important step in the right direction.&nbsp; The amended section 15 prohibits the importation, distribution and sale of any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>alternative tobacco products.&nbsp;I understand the indiscriminate and unregulated use of alternative tobacco product can similarly cause harm. However, many studies in Europe have shown benefits of such products in helping smokers kick the habit.&nbsp;As such, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider allowing alternative tobacco products as part of the strategy to help smokers progressively stop smoking altogether. I believe that if the use of these alternative products are regulated and employed judiciously, it can add to the armamentarium of anti-smoking strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many smokers start smoking at a very young age. They usually pick it up out of peer pressure or curiosity and find it hard to quit later on in life due to the addictive effect of nicotine.&nbsp;It is indeed worrying to note that the smoking prevalence among young men and women have increased from 18% to 25% and 7% to 9% respectively. I would like to ask the Minister what are the possible reasons and what more can be done to arrest this rising trend.&nbsp;Should the proliferation of low-priced tobacco products be curbed <p align=left>Column: 681<p>and can the price of tobacco be tightly controlled to discourage the youth and even adults from smoking?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would like to applaud the Ministry&rsquo;s continuous effort in strengthening tobacco control and also in educating the public on the adverse effects of tobacco smoking. The WHO has estimated that, on a global scale, one person dies from a tobacco-related illness every six seconds. The sad fact is that smoking is also the most avoidable cause of death. Smoking-related diseases and death must be seen as an epidemic and a serious public health concern.&nbsp;The Government must continue its effort in tackling this problem, as long as Singaporeans continue to light up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, I would like to firstly declare my interest as a practising medical practitioner, in stating suggestions and proposals for this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking kills&nbsp;six times as many people as those dying from road traffic accidents, suicide, murder, poisoning, manslaughter and HIV-related deaths all put together. Cigarette smoke has over 4,800 chemicals, and of which 70 have been proven to be carcinogenic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, policies that encourage existing smokers to quit and discourage non-smokers from starting are ideal. However, it is not a perfect world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in agreement with the suggested amendments. There are, however, two areas which I would like to elaborate on.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, on tobacco harm reduction. Harm reduction is a widely accepted strategy in public health that recognises <p align=left>Column: 682<p>that there will always be people who engage in risky behaviours. As abstinence is regarded as an unrealistic goal for some, the objective of harm reduction is to mitigate the health risk associated with the risky behaviour. Tobacco harm reduction acknowledges that a significant portion of tobacco users&nbsp;is unable or unwilling to break their addiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Bill, Sir, there appears to be a lack of&nbsp;tobacco harm reduction&nbsp;strategies. As such, I would like to propose&nbsp;having an option of a strategy to shift current tobacco users who cannot and are unable to quit to the less harmful nicotine products. Overall, the use of smokeless tobacco products confers only 2% of the health risk of smoking and the public health impact would be incredibly reduced. This offers them a gateway to quitting. It is also possible to restrict this further such that it is only for&nbsp;persons undergoing \"quit\" programmes by recognised bodies and institutions, and&nbsp;not for underage youth or&nbsp;unsupervised usage. These people can be monitored closely by the implementing institutions. This way, we can offer an option to those who need help to gradually quit in a controlled manner. On the other hand, Sir, if we do put forth the blanket rule ban, without assessing the evidence of these harm reducing products objectively, a large proportion of the remaining smokers will continue to smoke and will have a 50% chance of dying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the statistics from the Minister for Health and indeed it is not something that we want to hear &ndash; increasing numbers every year. Therefore,&nbsp;I feel&nbsp;tobacco harm reduction must come in. In the US, for example, the Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;(FDA) legislation requires manufacturers of safer tobacco products to prove that they will have no significant population effects before they are marketed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 683<p> Also, Britain&rsquo;s Royal College of Physicians, a prestigious body indeed, strongly endorses tobacco harm reduction. Comments from the College include, \"smokers smoke predominantly for nicotine. If nicotine can be provided in the form of a cigarette substitute, millions of lives can be saved. Harm reduction is an essential component of many aspects of medicine and day-to-day living\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, the American Association for Public Health Physicians adopted the policy of \"encouraging and enabling smokers to reduce their risk of tobacco related illness and death by switching to less hazardous smokeless tobacco products\". Smokeless tobacco has been proven to have&nbsp;much lower nitrosamine content, is&nbsp;less harmful than cigarette smoking,&nbsp;is not associated with respiratory illnesses such as chronic obstructive lung disease, and&nbsp;does not cause problem with passive smoking and third-hand smoke. In fact, tobacco-related mortality in low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco is only 10% of the risk of cigarette smoke. The Swedish experience with snus is like a natural \"experiment\" that has been going on. Since the usage begun, they have lowered lung cancer mortality and there has been no increase in the incidence of head and&nbsp;neck cancer and also several vascular accidents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG) published a consensus statement in 2008 on tackling the smoking epidemic, \"therapy to manage nicotine dependence can significantly improve patients&rsquo; chances of quitting successfully and is recommended for people who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, Sir, sound medical principles of&nbsp;tobacco harm&nbsp;reduction,&nbsp;as in the examples above, may be a regulatory move worth considering here in <p align=left>Column: 684<p>Singapore, instead of a blanket ban completely. Sir, Singapore has a R&amp;D laboratory, aimed at developing next generation reduced harm products that are substantiated by scientific evidence. If indeed the R&amp;D is done rigorously, becomes successful and the products can&nbsp; be proven scientifically to possess reduced harm claims, then laws that can permit objective assessment of the evidence presented by these harm reducing products, instead of a blanket rule to ban completely, will be worthy of our consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also interesting to note that \"nicotine is the primary substance responsible for tobacco dependence, but the majority of harm caused by tobacco use is not from nicotine, but from the by-products of smoked (or&nbsp;from burning) tobacco, such as fine particulates, carcinogens and noxious gases, including carbon monoxide.\" If levels of toxic chemicals can be drastically reduced by heating tobacco, instead of burning it, or by changing the mode of delivery of nicotine, there is a chance of developing a product that might be less harmful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a good body of rich literature and active R&amp;D going on globally on this topic. There may be potential spin-off benefits for Singapore. The presence of scientists in systems biology, state-of-the-art computational science, and disease modelling, allows for the osmosis of ideas, bridge gaps in knowledge, and creates a fertile R&amp;D environment. Hopefully, this will facilitate some break-throughs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, we can be selective in deciding which ones to be allowed in for regulation. I do support the ban on the sugarcoated and other nicotine candies which may prove attractive to children and&nbsp;youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 685<p> My second&nbsp;point relates to sponsorship and advertising. With this Bill, we will be removing the exemption clause which allows companies to sponsor arts and cultural events and be publicly acknowledged. Sir, I would just like to share with the House the following information:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Tobacco companies do have corporate social responsibilities going on in&nbsp;our community. One example I would like to quote&nbsp;is the \"Food from the Heart\" programme, supported by Phillip Morris;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;These companies do employ Singaporeans earning their living;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;How many of us know that, if an employee of a tobacco company or his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her family members passes on, the company is not allowed to put the company&rsquo;s name and logo or insignia of any sort with the obituary; and, finally,</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;Give this a thought. Does the average smoker in the street even know names like: Phillip Morris, Peter Stuyversant, and so on. Perhaps, the only thing these smokers care about would be that they have&nbsp;their cigarettes and they get to smoke it too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.&nbsp; I also hope with the arguments I have put forth, consideration will be given to the controlled regulation and usage of certain products in the specific situations I have discussed.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.

Today, I also rise in full support of the Bill before this House.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I concur with the Minister when he underscored the dangers that tobacco poses to our young. Nicotine is highly addictive and we should strenuously reduce its accessibility in all forms before it causes irreparable damage to our people, particularly our young and impressionistic students.&nbsp; In going about my daily tasks, I often chance upon young students, in their teens, taking an illegal puff at multi-storey car parks, taking refuge at the walls of staircase landings, thinking that they are able to hide from public view. They are teens in secondary school. Sometimes they are in uniform and other times, in casual wear. These teens get pass our strict laws against cigarette sale to minors by approaching adults for a cigarette or asking them to purchase on their behalf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose that schools take up the challenge and set up anti-smoking advocates to reach out to them. We should try and win over those who have taken up smoking. At the same time, we should build a so-called firewall and ring-fence the non-smokers from being influenced. Schools can organise activities and get the students to talk about the hazards of smoking. Introducing harsher penalties and more law enforcers are not enduring solutions. These youths may <p align=left>Column: 687<p>simply go \"underground\".&nbsp; In fact, by putting an age limit, it has an opposite psychological effect on the teens. To be able to buy cigarettes is regarded as a coming of age, \"I have come of age to be able to buy cigarette on my own.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree that parents too have a part to play, and I am sure many are strictly enforcing the rules at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trial research designed by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle in 2009&nbsp;on phone counselling found that it was effective in helping teens to quit smoking. These smokers from various high schools in Washington State received personalised smoking cessation counselling. It combined motivational interviewing with cognitive behavioural skills training. The smokers were taught to recognise the importance of quitting based on their own values, to anticipate and cope with stress and other factors that led them picking up smoking. It offered plans for stopping and eventually saw these plans through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistently, an earlier research published in 2001 by the John Hopkins Medical Institution and the Baltimore City Health Department&nbsp;has highlighted that personalised counselling will help smokers recognise the need to quit on their own accord. Activities included building camaraderie among the smokers, self-identification of personal smoking habits and perceived barriers to quitting. It also focused on developing strategies for quitting, and prevention of relapse and dealing with withdrawal symptoms. According to the research, this programme not only had a measurable impact on the smoking habits of participants but was also more effective in promoting quit attempts and in achieving smoking cessation as compared to exposing them to just simply educational materials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consecutively-held personalised counselling sessions provided by trained <p align=left>Column: 688<p>counsellors will help to address and curtail smoking among young adults and students. I understand that the Singapore Cancer Society has a counselling scheme where students caught smoking by the Police can be referred&nbsp;&ndash; I repeat the words \"can be referred\"&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to them&nbsp;for counselling. This is not sufficient.&nbsp; I urge the relevant Ministries to work together and consider incorporating smoking cessation and personal anti-smoking counselling programmes in schools or in the polyclinics and make it compulsory for the school students who are caught smoking to undergo such personalised counselling programmes since they are proven to be effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Speaker,&nbsp;I&nbsp;support&nbsp;the amendment of the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.06 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I commend the Minister for Health for introducing this Bill in Parliament and augmenting on the previous Smoking Act.&nbsp; It is indeed heartening to note Singapore&rsquo;s achievements in the past few decades in its fight to stay smoke-free and control tobacco and smoking across the island.&nbsp; It is laudable that we are 14% in terms of smoking prevalence, one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp; I support the drive towards curtailing smoking and introduction of further legislation to control advertisements and sale.&nbsp; In particular, it is imperative for our legislation to stay relevant with the advent of smokeless alternatives and new designer tobacco and nicotine-related products which may at first instance appear harmless but can have long-term ramifications and affect our populace, especially the young.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I have two major concerns which I hope to echo in my short speech on this topic related to smoking and tobacco use.&nbsp; Firstly, I am particularly concerned with the fact that more young adults are becoming smokers <p align=left>Column: 689<p>and also the issue of underage smoking.&nbsp; Secondly, I am concerned with the fact that although we have only 14% smoking prevalence, the majority who are non-smokers are still having to face the brunt of second-hand smoke which is medically known to be just as harmful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware we have been embarking on concerted outreach to youths and the young on the ills of smoking as well as tightening up enforcement of sale of cigarettes and tobacco to those underage.&nbsp; But is there more that can be done in terms of enforcement against underage smokers as well as convincing our youngsters to skip and quit the habit?&nbsp; This new Bill augments the efforts to minimise this problem but my personal thoughts are whether the current education programmes or enforcement machinery are sufficient. If yes, why is there a trend towards rising number of younger smokers amidst our population?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my second point, I recently received an email from a resident of mine whom I shall call \"A\".&nbsp; He lives in an HDB flat with his wife who was recently pregnant.&nbsp; \"A\" has a neighbour, whom I shall call \"B\" who lives next to his unit and both \"B\" and his wife and their siblings living in that unit are smokers.&nbsp; They do not smoke inside the unit as they have a child inside, but they smoke at the corridor.&nbsp; Despite numerous requests by \"A\", the occupants in \"B\"'s unit continued to smoke.&nbsp; \"A\" approached \"B\" and his wife but was told off that there is no law to curb smoking in the corridor.&nbsp; \"A\" tried to call NEA and NEA gave the same reply that there is no ban on smoking in corridors.&nbsp; \"A\" and his wife were highly distressed by this incident.&nbsp; Sadly, \"A\"'s wife had a miscarriage recently and lost the baby.&nbsp; \"A\" attributed it to the smoke, distress and depression caused by their inconsiderate neighbour \"B\" and asked me to voice it out and help <p align=left>Column: 690<p>him stop this problem.&nbsp; I can empathise with him.&nbsp; It is a sad loss.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the cause of the miscarriage may not be easily proven, I opine that we can do more to help the majority of 86% of the populace (who do not smoke) so that they do not have to bear the brunt of having to face the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.&nbsp; We have come a long way after we started to ban smoking in certain public establishments and selected public places.&nbsp; However, I submit that NEA can re-visit and re-examine the areas where smoking can be further curtailed through public consultation and to augment the current enforcement efforts to resolutely curb smoking in areas where smoking is prohibited.&nbsp; Ask any HDB dweller and he or she will tell you that smokers are still seen in lifts and many common spaces in the heartlands where smoking is actually prohibited under the new slew of prohibitory measures.&nbsp; I know a total ban is not possible but can and will legislation be introduced to prohibit smoking in void decks, common corridors, apartment lift lobbies and common spaces in the heartlands?&nbsp; I know many non-smokers often suffer in silence when forced to inhale second-hand smoke, including smoke from neighbours who live in close proximity.&nbsp; I speak for them and hope we can do more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these considerations, I support this Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.10 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> I rise in support of this Bill.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About seven Singaporeans die prematurely from smoking-related diseases each day. Hence, I support more stringent measures to curb smoking in Singapore and to bring our law in line with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. I also agree that our law should <p align=left>Column: 691<p>cover other new and alternative tobacco products. Although we still have one of the lowest smoking prevalence among females in the world, the number is increasing, especially among young women in the 18 to 29 age group, which has increased from 6% in 2004 to 9% in 2007.&nbsp; Several countries, such as India and Japan, have already reported popular use of tobacco products, such as flavoured cigarettes and tobacco candy, by young women. So, we should stop these products from being sold here.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicotine is so addictive that according to estimates, three quarters of those who quit eventually return to the habit.&nbsp; I have people who asked for financial help smelling very strongly of cigarette smoke.&nbsp; Even when they are faced with severe financial difficulties, they are not able to drop the smoking habit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to focus on the problems of smoking at the workplace and in the Malay community, particularly&nbsp;Malay youths.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, 15% of our working population was smoking but this had risen to 16% in 2007. The highest increase is among the 18 to 29 years old, as 20% of them smoke compared to 17% in the general population.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides smoking out of habit, young adults have cited the stress of starting their first job and influence from colleagues at the workplace as reasons for smoking. As a majority of the smokers in Singapore are in the workforce, it is very important that companies put in place strong smoking control initiatives.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2002 study done by the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University showed that a 16% smoking prevalence in the workplace would cost companies $2,200 per smoker each year. Smoking results in lower <p align=left>Column: 692<p>productivity, higher absenteeism and larger healthcare costs for companies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly in the companies&rsquo; interest to encourage employees to stay smoke-free and healthy. Based on the 2006 National Workplace Health Promotion Prevalence Survey, about 25% of the companies with a workforce size of at least 50 have a smoking control programme, an 18% increase from 7% in 1998.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much more can be done, and some companies are already doing so, such as Sheraton Towers which started its smoking control programme in 2005 following a survey which revealed that 20% of its employees were smokers. With strong management support, a \"No Smoking Policy\" was implemented on the hotel&rsquo;s premises and the cost of conducting smoking cessation programmes by trained medical personnel was entirely borne by the hotel. As a result of these efforts, the hotel achieved a 6% decrease in the number of smokers between 2005 and 2008.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge more companies to follow Sheraton Hotel&rsquo;s example to achieve win-win outcomes, and I urge the Ministry to place greater focus on workplace efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100719/20100719VS_115149.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.]&nbsp; Sir, the smoking prevalence among the Malay community had increased from 18% in 2004 to 23% in 2007, especially among Malay men.&nbsp; In 2007, more than four in 10 Malay men were smokers compared to two in 10 Chinese and Indian males.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is especially worrying as many of them are also heavy smokers and regularly smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day. The reasons they cited for smoking include for relaxation and relieving stress. Many of them have also cited addiction to cigarettes as the main barrier to quit this habit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 693<p>The majority of these male smokers are married and smoking becomes a financial burden. Furthermore, smoking does not only affect the smokers, it can also harm the health of their family members. It is important to highlight all these issues in the smoking cessation programmes targeted at the Malay community, so that we can see its effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many male smokers started smoking when they were young and this situation still continues. I am very concerned with the Malay youths. Our statistics are worrying. With the help of some friends, I conducted a study among 43 Malay youths aged between 15&nbsp;and 26 years who are smokers. The statistics that I obtained are very alarming.&nbsp; Thirty-two of these youths started smoking when they were 15 years old or younger. In fact, one of them even started smoking when he was only eight years old.&nbsp; Twenty-five of these youths were introduced to cigarettes by their friends. There were two of them who were introduced by their own fathers. This is bizarre and strange, but it happened. Almost all the youths smoke every day.&nbsp; Thirty-two of them smoke at least five sticks of cigarettes a day, while four of them smoke 15 to 40 sticks of cigarettes a day.&nbsp; Thirty-four of these youths had fathers who smoke. In fact, for two of them, their mothers also smoke &ndash; which is quite worrying.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This clearly indicates that when the fathers smoke, they become negative role models to their children, which is consistent with research findings which support the same point.&nbsp; Hence, awareness programmes should also publicise this fact to encourage them to kick the habit, if they truly care for their children&rsquo;s welfare.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue of concern is the ease with which young people are able to buy cigarettes. The majority of them secured <p align=left>Column: 694<p>their cigarettes from friends, coffee shops, provision shops or convenience stores and, in some cases, they purchased cigarettes that are sold illegally. Most of them also said that the shop operators where they purchased the cigarettes from either did not ask for their age or, even if they did, did not bother to check their identity cards.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 833-834.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Mr Speaker, if we want to stop the increase in cigarette smoking among the young, there is a need to ensure stronger enforcement measures against shops&nbsp;that are flouting the law by selling cigarettes to those below 18.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to step up its enforcement action against such errant shops.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond that, I also urge cigarette companies, if they truly have a strong sense of corporate social responsibility, to audit their suppliers, their agents and their retailers to ensure that they do not sell to those under the age of 18 which is against the law.&nbsp; It would indeed be contradictory if cigarette companies participated in community projects aimed at helping the poor and needy, and yet its products&nbsp;could&nbsp;create the smoking addiction which had contributed to the problems of the poor and&nbsp;needy in the first place.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also believe it is important to help those who are already smoking to quit.&nbsp; But the survey&nbsp;results that I have&nbsp;cited show that we must also put a lot more emphasis on prevention as the smoking habit once started is extremely addictive and difficult to stop.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry, with the support of community groups, schools and families, to put more effort into preventing smoking among the young.&nbsp; The Ministry should also continuously evaluate the effectiveness of existing smoking prevention and cessation programmes so that our approach can be more focused and targeted.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member)--><p align=left>Column: 695<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.19 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. I have only one point to make, in the form of a suggestion. Can I suggest that we include the terms \"marketing and promotion\" wherever and whenever the term \"advertising\" appears in the Bill?&nbsp; I believe that this will cover a loophole that tobacco companies may be able to exploit to promote their products.<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some years ago, at an outdoor event, I saw a tobacco company sponsoring a hospitality tent by subtly using the colours of their well-known cigarette packaging as the theme of their tentage. In the tent was custom-made furniture in the shape and colours of their cigarette packaging.&nbsp; The staff who manned the tent were also all dressed in uniforms in the colours that one would automatically associate with the cigarette packaging.&nbsp; Though subtle, this was obviously a clever way for the tobacco company to circumvent the law regarding advertising, but is nevertheless still an attempt to promote their product.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This will include below-the-line as well as above-the-line advertising, event association and even the subtle forms of marketing that I illustrated earlier.&nbsp; The use of tobacco is a harmful, nasty habit that should not be encouraged in any form.&nbsp; Tobacco companies should not be able to exploit any loopholes in the law in order to market their poisonous wares to an unsuspecting public.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is strange why there is even a sensible debate about smoking in this day and age.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The harmful effects of smoking are well established.&nbsp; I came ready to this House to cite facts and figures to back this up, but many Members of this House have cited the same figures.&nbsp; So I would not trouble the House to repeat them.&nbsp; However, we all know that non-smokers are also at risk.&nbsp; Involuntary smoking involves exposure to the same numerous carcinogens and toxic substances that are present in mainstream tobacco smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 69 identified carcinogens in tobacco smoke.&nbsp; Indeed, there is a higher concentration of carcinogens found in sidestream smoke than mainstream smoke because the former is produced at a lower temperature, resulting in incomplete combustion of the tobacco.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies have shown that non-smokers increase their risk of developing lung cancer by 20% to 30% and heart disease by 25% to 30% when they are exposed to second-hand smoke.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has had a direct economic impact.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Health Promotion Board, the social cost of smoking in 1997 ranged from $673 to $839 million.&nbsp; This includes the direct costs such as payments for hospitalisation and healthcare, morbidity costs (lost of production due to smoking-related illnesses) and mortality costs (lost production from people who died early due to smoking).&nbsp; This social cost therefore overwhelms the economic benefits of smoking &ndash; about S$600 million or so collected in Government taxes every year from tobacco products.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts and figures I have cited are not new.&nbsp; Yet, large numbers continue to smoke, increasingly so.&nbsp; Why do they do it?&nbsp; For many years, the tobacco <p align=left>Column: 697<p>companies ran advertisements to promote how \"macho\" and how \"cool\" smoking was.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marlboro Man, expertly herding cattle on the great plains while puffing on his cigarette, became the symbol of manhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generations were drawn to cigarettes, and became addicted without even realising it.&nbsp; Allegations of health risks were dismissed or demolished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adverse reports were suppressed.&nbsp; All in the name of profit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we now know the truth.&nbsp; Litigation in the US has exposed what some tobacco companies have been doing to protect and expand their business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These include engaging in schemes to defraud smokers and potential smokers by falsely denying the adverse health effects of smoking; falsely denying that nicotine and smoking are addictive; falsely denying that they manipulated cigarette design and composition so as to assure nicotine delivery levels that create and sustain addiction; representing that light and low tar cigarettes deliver less nicotine and tar and therefore present fewer health risks than full flavour cigarettes; falsely denying that they market to youth; falsely denying that second-hand smoke causes disease; and, finally, suppressing documents, information and research to prevent the public from learning the truth about these subjects and to avoid or limit liability in litigation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would have thought that with this knowledge, cigarettes would be banned forever.&nbsp; If tomato ketchup or milk had half the carcinogens and toxins cigarettes have, or carried half the health risks, they would be removed from supermarket shelves in a heartbeat.&nbsp; We banned the sale of chewing gums for much less.&nbsp; With cigarettes, somehow it is different.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debate over the harmful effects of smoking has long been over.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, tobacco companies openly acknowledge <p align=left>Column: 698<p>that their products cause cancer and increase health risks.&nbsp; That, however, has not stopped them selling the stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stark reality is that the smoking culture has become entrenched in our society.&nbsp; Smokers now say it is their human right to light up.&nbsp; Addiction has the effect.&nbsp; Governments around the world know that even if they wanted to, they are powerless to get rid of smoking completely.&nbsp; A complete ban is political suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some countries, campaign contributions from tobacco companies will dry up or, worst, move to your political opponent.&nbsp; Significant tax dollars will also be lost.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we take little steps, like putting warnings on packages, or pictures of diseased organs or, like in Australia, having nothing at all on the packages, as&nbsp;if all this will really stop a smoker from getting his fix.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we rationalise.&nbsp; We say that smokers now have been warned about the ill effects.&nbsp; We ban smoking in public buildings and say smoking in private places is a matter of choice, except that that choice has been compromised by the drugs deliberately introduced in cigarettes to make them addictive.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what about the children?&nbsp; Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of second-hand smoke because their bodies are still growing and they breathe at a faster rate than adults.&nbsp; In the US, between 150,000 and 300,000 children under the age of 18 months get respiratory infections (such as pneumonia and bronchitis) from second-hand smoke.&nbsp; More than 40% of children who visit the emergency room for severe asthma attacks live with smokers.&nbsp; I have on many occasions seen adults smoking with children nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is looking after the child&rsquo;s interests?&nbsp; What choice does a child have?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, the increase in awareness of the health risks and the crackdown on <p align=left>Column: 699<p>smoking in public areas have obviously caused tobacco companies concern about revenue loss.&nbsp; That has prompted them to develop and market an increasing range of alternatives to the conventional cigarette.&nbsp; The Minister has given examples of these and they include: safer cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products and alternative nicotine products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of \"safer cigarettes\" marketed elsewhere include a cigarette that heats up but does not burn tobacco and is advertised with claims of \"less risk\" of certain smoke-related diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that these products have not been proven to be medically safer.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smokeless tobacco has been marketed as useful alternatives where smoking is prohibited, or when it is inconvenient to smoke.&nbsp; These include flavoured chewing tobacco, with flavours such as peach, cherry, wild berry, mint, green apple and wintergreen.&nbsp; There is even now a tobacco lozenge &ndash; a mint-flavoured, smokeless, compressed tobacco lozenge (a \"cigalett\" &ndash; about the size of a Tic-Tac breath mint).&nbsp; So while you may be dying of cancer, your breath will always be minty and fresh.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More worryingly, these flavoured tobacco have candy-like appeal, which make them attractive to children.&nbsp; The flavours also make the product seem more harmless.&nbsp; This is a good way to get children started on tobacco-use.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of smokeless tobacco is more discreet than smoking, which may mean it is easier for children to use without drawing attention to themselves.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tobacco companies cannot be expected to regulate themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their track record speaks for itself.&nbsp; So unless we act firmly and decisively, a whole new generation may end up being addicted to tobacco and nicotine.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore support the proposed amendments, in particular, the new <p align=left>Column: 700<p>section 17A, which prohibits the use of any term descriptor or trade mark which creates the false impression that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products.&nbsp; And I hope the Minister will ban any statement which is not supported by independent research.&nbsp; I also support section 15, which prohibits the sale of chewing tobacco and also give the Minister power to prohibit other tobacco products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, nonetheless, like to raise three points.&nbsp; First, the amendments also deal with new products touted to be nicotine alternatives.&nbsp; I understand these to be tobacco-free products with added nicotine, intended to deliver the nicotine-kick without smoking.&nbsp; Examples include: nicotine pellets or candy; nicotine water, as the Minister said, which incidentally contains enough the equivalent nicotine of two cigarettes; and nicotine wafers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with chewing tobacco, these products may be attractive to younger people, and create a new generation of nicotine addicts.&nbsp; Further, the marketing of such products is troubling.&nbsp; For example, nicotine water has been marketed as a \"dietary supplement\".&nbsp; These are relatively new and unfamiliar products which may result in people consuming larger doses of nicotine unsuspectingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; So over and above banning them, will the Government also educate the public about the harmful nature of these products so that they will not unknowingly purchase them when they are abroad or bring them back to Singapore for their friends or families to try?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I urge the Minister to use his powers under section 15 to progressively lower the nicotine and tar limits of tobacco products sold in Singapore.&nbsp; The Minister has mentioned certain limits in his speech and I hope that will not be the final limit he sets.&nbsp; The tobacco companies will no doubt ask for time to adjust to new regulations, but if pushed, they will <p align=left>Column: 701<p>no doubt find a way to comply.&nbsp; Where there is a profit, there is a way.&nbsp; Could the Minister share with this House his plans in relation to the exercise of his powers under section 15(2), both immediate and in the future?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, while I accept that this is not within the Minister&rsquo;s remit, will the Government consider measures to protect children from the effects of second-hand or side-stream smoke?&nbsp; At the very least, the Government should consider regulations against smoking whether in public or in private within close proximity to children?&nbsp; I know it is difficult to regulate what happens in the privacy of a person's home.&nbsp; But we have done it before for other undesirable conduct.&nbsp; And I think there is great value in such a law as a symbol of what we consider to be appropriate and responsible social behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan (Nominated Member):</B> Thank you,&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to share my reflections.&nbsp; Smoking kills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Addiction to smoking is the greatest cause of avoidable mortality and morbidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking causes harm to almost every single organ in the human body and is a risk factor that is associated with numerous&nbsp;diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to harming their own health, smokers also put non-smokers at risk.&nbsp; Therefore, I give my strongest support&nbsp;to this important Bill that will reinforce the strong anti-tobacco stance adopted by this Government.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments detailed in this Bill, taken together, further reinforce the commitment our Government has taken to alleviate the prevalence of smoking in Singapore and to protect the health and well-being of Singaporeans, in particular, non-smokers from the ill-effects of <p align=left>Column: 702<p>second-hand smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Smoking (Control of Advertisement and Sale of Tobacco) Act as well as the Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Places Act are the pillars which uphold Singapore's tobacco control efforts and sustain a smoke-free Singapore.&nbsp; The prevalence of smoking among Singaporeans aged 18-64 years has decreased significantly since 1975 (when it was at about 27.5%) to the rate that&nbsp;it&nbsp;has been hovering now, at about 13.6% and this is indeed a remarkable achievement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate the Ministry of Health for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the overall prevalence has declined, we also note a disturbing trend; an increase in the prevalence of smoking among younger Singaporeans, which the Minister has already highlighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevalence rate of smoking among those aged 18-29 years has increased from 12.3% in 2004 to 17.2% in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research on young smokers shows that the experiment with smoking in their adolescence, starting from as young as when they are 12 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our current climate where strong anti-tobacco norms prevail and the harmful effects of smoking are well documented and publicised, these trends are both surprising and alarming.&nbsp;&nbsp;What additional measures can we take to stop teens from experimenting with cigarettes, to alleviate the risk to nicotine addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I have three suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must step up on enforcement to prevent supply of tobacco products to teens below 18 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 10 in the Smoking Control Act spells out provisions for enforcement on prohibition of supply of tobacco products to persons below 18 years old.&nbsp; In addition to policing establishments that sell tobacco products, we must also enforce punitive measures on those who supply or acquire tobacco products for underage smokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to further discourage the violation of section 10, will the Minister consider raising the penalty for repeat offenders?&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion focuses on&nbsp;the root <p align=left>Column: 703<p>cause of deviation from the prescribed norms.&nbsp; An important question that I have&nbsp;been asking is,&nbsp;what puts youths at risk for smoking?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sociological research shows a very strong link between detachment from schools and family, and underage smoking.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her thesis on young smokers, Karen Cheong, who is an Health Promotion Board (HPB) scholar, completing her PhD in Sociology under my supervision, found that teens who perceive that mainstream goals were not within their reach were more likely to embrace&nbsp;sub-cultures and seek affirmation from like-minded peers.&nbsp; For example, teenagers who do not&nbsp;fair well academically would turn to affirmation from peers in similar circumstances.&nbsp; Sadly, there&nbsp;is also a strong correlation between detachment from schools and detachment from the family.&nbsp; For these marginalised teens, family support was also challenged.&nbsp; As we discussed the ill-effects of tobacco use, I would like to seize this opportunity to focus our attention on this group of young Singaporeans who are at the margins.&nbsp; It is important that we continue to look into the needs of our youth, strive towards a broader platform for recognising achievements so that all young Singaporeans will be able to find resonance with the goals we set for them as a community.&nbsp; Only then,&nbsp;can we render deviant norms, like smoking, irrelevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.35 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp; The dangers of tobacco usage are well-documented and we must do our utmost to reduce the incidence of tobacco usage.&nbsp; There are, however, two areas of concern in this Bill that I would like to highlight.&nbsp; First, I should disclose that I have received in my capacity as Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Chair for Home Affairs and Law representations <p align=left>Column: 704<p>from a number of tobacco companies.&nbsp; I am also a partner in the law firm which is acting for one of these companies.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first issue relates to the implications of this Bill on Intellectual Property Law obligation.&nbsp; As the Bill stands, there is descriptor regulation that is being proposed&nbsp;in section 17A.&nbsp; The proposed section 17A prohibits the importation of sale of any tobacco product if its packaging and get-up may suggest that it is less harmful or gives a false impression of its health effects, or if the Minister prescribes so.&nbsp; The amendment is aimed at preventing the public from being misled into believing that the particular tobacco product is less harmful than other tobacco products because of the use of descriptive language or packaging.&nbsp; That, in itself, is a worthwhile objective and I do support the Bill&nbsp;giving the Minister such a power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, my concern is that this amendment does appear to include \"trademarks\" within its scope.&nbsp; That may lead us to be in possible non-compliance with Intellectual Property Law obligations.&nbsp; As the Minister mentioned,&nbsp;examples of brand names that might be affected are those carrying the words 'light' or 'mild' or something similar.&nbsp; Some of these maybe registered trademarks in Singapore.&nbsp; This is in contrast&nbsp;with other terms used to describe, for instance,&nbsp;taste characteristics&nbsp;such as \"low tar\" which are generally added after the brand name, as opposed to actually being part of the brand name.&nbsp; Under our Trade Marks Act, a \"registered trademark is the personal property\" of the proprietor and the proprietor has exclusive rights&nbsp;to use the trademark.&nbsp; Inherent in our statutory scheme for the registration of trademarks is the determination of whether a trademark is of such nature as&nbsp;to deceive&nbsp;the public.&nbsp; Therefore a fair case can be made when the trademark has been registered and used in the past, that it was not considered to have confused or <p align=left>Column: 705<p>deceived the public.&nbsp; Further, Singapore is a party to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIPS requires a minimum level of protection for IP rights.&nbsp; Article 8 of&nbsp;TRIPS provides that signatories \"may in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health, provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions&nbsp;of this Agreement\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 17 of TRIPS requires that when measures are taken, limiting the rights of trademark holders, such exceptions should take account of the legitimate interest the owner of the trademark.&nbsp; If we are to adopt section 17A in its present form, we must take care not to marginalise the legitimate interest of holders of registered trademarks and, more importantly, not breach our TRIPS obligations.&nbsp; There may also be treaties&nbsp;where Singapore has entered into, for example, with the United States and Japan, to name just two, which requires us to uphold intellectual property rights.&nbsp; Based on the above,&nbsp;I ask if the Minister could make it clear that section 17A shall not prohibit use of a term that is used in a brand name, which was registered as a trademark prior to the effective date of the&nbsp;amendment Act.&nbsp; I understand that similar approaches have been taken in other countries such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second issue I would like to raise relates to the use of regulatory powers to ban particular tobacco products.&nbsp; Section 15 of the draft Bill provides the Minister with powers to ban any and all harmful tobacco products based on his discretion.&nbsp; This provision appears to be targeted at alternative forms of tobacco products such as chewing tobacco and smokeless tobacco.&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board's consultation document noted that most new <p align=left>Column: 706<p>alternative forms of tobacco products are marketed as safer alternatives to cigarettes, despite the lack of conclusive evidence, and that these products potentially undermine the effectiveness of Singapore's cessation strategies as smokers may switch to using these products. This is a valid observation and I support the Minister having such powers.&nbsp; Having said that, I believe that a judicious use of such powers will also be in the interest of public health especially when these alternative products can actually be proven to be less harmful and might lead to more smokers kicking the habit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do echo the sentiments raised by two of my&nbsp;colleagues, Dr Lam Pin Min and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef that harm reduction is a useful weapon in the strategy of reducing the incidence of tobacco usage.&nbsp; We&nbsp;do not live in an ideal world where smokers quit smoking because it is good for them.&nbsp; Provided it can be scientifically proven that such products may result in lesser harm or lesser tendency to be addicted, we should consider&nbsp;allowing such products because&nbsp;it would allow some smokers to reduce their dependency on tobacco.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Minister, therefore, make it clear that before exercising his powers to ban any particular product, there will be a detailed product assessment procedure where affected parties could seek to justify their products as less harmful or addictive, and with an avenue for appeal? There could be provision for an advisory panel of medical experts to make sure that&nbsp;claims of products being less harmful than conventional tobacco products be scientifically supported.&nbsp; I do&nbsp;consider that the ultimate goal would be to stop all smoking.&nbsp; But it&nbsp;may be pragmatic to adopt an approach to permit less harmful or addictive products, which would help to \"wean\" smokers off cigarettes. This would complement rather than undermine our prevention and cessation efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 707<p> On that note, Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.42 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the amendment Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco consumption is a vile, habit-forming practice that is potentially harmful and deadly.&nbsp; It cuts short the lives of a third to half of its users. According to a World Health Organization report, perhaps 100 million people died prematurely in the last century from tobacco consumption.&nbsp; This figure, in the eyes of many, is of tragic proportion as the deaths are preventable.&nbsp; Unless we do something very significant now, studies have indicated that another&nbsp;one billion people may die in this century if the current trend continues.&nbsp; Against the backdrop of such alarming statistics, I welcome the initiatives by the Government to put together a tighter restriction on advertisement and sale of tobacco products; all of which I&nbsp;agree.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I wholeheartedly embrace the changes&nbsp;in this Bill, I will say that the changes may not have gone far enough. I say this with three specific references&nbsp;in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this Bill deals with putting restrictions on any form of direct or indirect&nbsp;tobacco product advertisement as opposed to tobacco brand advertisement.&nbsp; At the moment, neither the Act nor the Bill deals with tobacco brands that find its way into other goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette companies have sought to promote consumption and sales through association with certain&nbsp;lifestyle, activity or values.&nbsp; Many of us will recall how&nbsp;\"Camel\" brand of cigarettes has found its way into a line of clothing that at first brush may&nbsp;have nothing to do with cigarettes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette brand names have also appeared in travel services such as \"Peter Stuyvesant Travel &amp; Tours\" or \"Kent Holidays\".&nbsp; Such insidious forms of <p align=left>Column: 708<p>advertisements are a more dangerous form of marketing as it easily targets&nbsp;the young and vulnerable to ensure early brand endorsement.&nbsp; And on this note, I share the similar concerns of my colleagues.&nbsp; Arguably, it would not be difficult for one who is mentally conditioned to move from the \"Camel\" brand of cargo pants to the \"Camel\" brand of cigarettes.&nbsp; Would the authorities not be concerned if the same brand of cigarettes started to appear in children's toys in place of \"Fisher Price\" brand of products?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tobacco brands&nbsp;appear innocently on products and services. However, they present a very powerful form of subliminal appeal and can make their presence felt quietly in many areas of our everyday lives. This is latent advertising.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April this year, it was reported that doctors have urged governments to launch an inquiry into alleged \"subliminal\" tobacco advertising on Ferrari Formula One cars. It is claimed the red, white and black bar code on Ferrari cars and overalls, is intended to remind viewers of Marlboro cigarettes branding. Similarly, the <I>Observer</I> reported that Philip Morris, the manufacturer of the Marlboro cigarettes, is such a believer in experiential marketing that it funds owners of public establishments to have their interior decorations done up in a manner to convey the strength of the brand. For instance, a patron could be lounging in front of a screen and being bombarded with the Wild West cowboy scenes of Marlboro country, and be entertained by Bernstein&rsquo;s theme song from the Magnificent Seven playing in the background. Now, one can never fail to feel macho about being associated with the Marlboro brand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally, I understand that the three of the Marlboro men who appeared in the advertisements, died subsequently from lung cancer. The question really is, where does one draw the line? Should the Government take active steps to stop or <p align=left>Column: 709<p>regulate such subliminal forms of advertising?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the social signaling of smoking in the public media. Advertisements are a very powerful form of communication that appeals to the target audience&rsquo;s sense of being, aspiration and desire. It is meant to connect with the audience and can strongly influence the development and acceptance of a set of socially acceptable values. Sociologists call this social engineering. So we go to the movie houses and see our heroes and heroines, our favorite characters, going about their business with a cigarette half dangling out of their mouths. Think of the pretty slim and young actress smoking away and looking glamorous on the screen. They are our favorite people; and, to us, it must be all right to smoke since they smoke in the movies.&nbsp;A new and recent groundbreaking study linked to the <I>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</I> shows that young adult smokers who are most likely to light up immediately are those who watch smoking in movies. The study is the first of its kind to directly link smoking scenes in movies to actual and immediate smoking behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember some years ago coming across an actor by the name of James Dean in the movies. Again, those of us who are old enough will remember the iconic actor holding a cigarette in his hand. I cannot imagine what kind of impression that image must have left on many impressionable youngsters of the&nbsp;time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same concern also applies to what has been portrayed on television. I have come across, often times, scenes on television screens where the protagonist is often seen holding a cigarette in his hand as part of a scene. It was reported in the Wikipedia that Mark Lee, our favourite local comedian, could be seen smoking <p align=left>Column: 710<p>the red Marlboro cigarettes in most of Jack Neo's movies. Would this scene constitute tobacco advertisement under the Act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I am not advocating that we should ban all cigarettes from the movie or TV sets, we should at least have a comprehensive policy on how to deal with such indirect form of advertising. In some jurisdictions, there are warnings after the screenings in the end credits section or the packaging of the CD or DVDs, to warn of the hazards of smoking. In the United States, films with G, PG or PG-13 rating, allow smoking incidents (that means depicting tobacco smoking or related signage or paraphernalia) to appear only when there is a substantial reason for doing so. Sir, I think we can do likewise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, there is the risk of tobacco advertising through the Internet. This generation has seen the pervasive use of the Internet as a means of communication and information sourcing. A whole generation of young people is now glued onto the screen surfing the Internet for a wide variety of reasons. It potentially serves as a huge market for sales. I would not be surprised if tobacco companies are also interested in using this medium to promote their products. Presently, I understand that Internet giants like Google and Microsoft have policies that outlaw the promotion of tobacco products on their advertising networks. However, the same cannot be said about all other major Internet service providers whose revenue depends on advertising. Can we realistically expect these companies to say no to tobacco advertisements when there is so much money to be made from it? We have difficulty stopping pornographic materials filtering through the Internet, how confident can we be about regulating tobacco advertising on the Internet? It will be a sad day indeed if popular gaming sites or social networking sites are populated and rife with advertisements on tobacco products; and <p align=left>Column: 711<p>we are not even talking about subliminal advertising that are being used as part of new technology that in essence, involves microsecond flashing of the advertisements to inform the subconscious mind. Does the Government have any policy in this regard in regulating it; or&nbsp;even, is the Government beginning to think about it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue on hand is whether the Government is prepared to do more to curb the advertisements and consequent sales of tobacco products in this country. I note that in some countries, cigarettes are not allowed to be displayed in showcases, whether or not there are youths patronising the establishment. Presumably, this restriction works on the principle of it being out of sight and, therefore, out of mind. Such legislation is far reaching. I am not sure if the Government is prepared to go to such an extent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill is among other things to bring Singapore in line with and to fulfil Singapore&rsquo;s outstanding obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The question is whether it is just enough for us to be up to date or, given the known and harmful effects that tobacco substance abuse has on our society, we should be doing more to educate and prevent the spread of such addictive habits. Given the choice, I would urge our Government to do much more than what&nbsp;is currently being proposed in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that Sir, I support the proposed amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.50 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir. First, let me declare my interest as a Board member of the Health Promotion Board.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the Ministry for responding quickly to the&nbsp;emerging tobacco trends <p align=left>Column: 712<p>and proposing a range of evidence-informed amendments to the Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act. The proposed measures not only signal the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the world&rsquo;s first health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, but it also&nbsp;sends a clear message that, despite having a relatively low smoking prevalence, Singapore continues to ensure that measures are put in place to minimise the impact of tobacco use on our people&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has seen a steady decline in its smoking prevalence since the 1970s when the first tobacco control legislation was enacted. However, as highlighted by Minister Khaw, there has been&nbsp;an increase in the smoking prevalence in recent years, especially among young adults aged 18 to 29 years. The age of smoking initiation was found to be 16 years young! Peer pressure, curiosity, and the misconception that one will not get easily addicted to nicotine &ndash; these are some of the reasons why our youths initiate smoking. Once they start, it can be very difficult to quit, given the highly addictive nature of nicotine. Our tobacco control measures must therefore look into how best to tighten access to tobacco products and their substitutes and to prevent initiation, especially among youths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\">[<B>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair</B> ]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am particularly concerned about the new and emerging products that Minister Khaw has highlighted and he has shown us a few samples this afternoon. International examples have shown that these products are highly popular among youths. Recently, I saw an episode of the popular American documentary programme,&nbsp;<I>60 Minutes</I>, on YouTube, which focused on snus. It featured a youth who used snus in the gym, in class, and even when having his dinner, simply to satisfy his insatiable craving for nicotine. It struck <p align=left>Column: 713<p>me that such a scenario could easily become a reality in Singapore. In fact, in a recent focus group discussion conducted by Health Promotion Board, youth smokers aged 15 to 17 expressed that they would be curious to try some of the new and emerging tobacco products that were shown to them. In addition, they felt that some of the products appeared easier to use than cigarettes and that they could pose challenges to the enforcement of underaged smoking laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst such products are relatively new and studies on their full extent of harm are still ongoing, it is important to take pre-emptive action now rather than later.&nbsp;So, I am pleased to note that the proposed amendments look into banning new and emerging products. However, while we may ban such products, our youths might still be able to have access to them when they are overseas, or be misled by deceiving information from the manufacturers of such products.&nbsp;We, therefore, need to continue to educate our youth, going beyond cigarette smoking to include tobacco in other forms and stressing the addictive power of nicotine. We also need to teach our young to be discerning about the tactics of the tobacco industry and help them to develop life skills to stay tobacco-free for life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, while we look into addressing new and emerging products, we should continue to tighten controls on existing products. Similar to international studies, a local study in 2009, found that a significant proportion of Singapore residents perceived that cigarette packs labelled with descriptors like \"mild\" and \"light\", delivered less nicotine, and that they were less harmful to health, and this would make it easier for a smoker to quit, compared with other descriptors.&nbsp;In the same focus group discussion that I had made reference to earlier, the youth <p align=left>Column: 714<p>smokers also shared that they smoked cigarettes labelled \"mild\" as they were under the impression that these were safer options.&nbsp;I am therefore heartened to know that we are looking at prohibiting misleading labels such as \"mild\" and \"light\", and am sure that MOH and HPB will continue to study and to adapt international best practices in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of the minimum pack size for cigarettes in 1993 had effectively prevented retailers from selling loose sticks of cigarettes at low prices. Price has been shown to be an effective deterrent for individuals experimenting with cigarettes.&nbsp;Congruent to international observations, in a local survey involving smokers and non-smokers aged 12 to 29 years, one in four (that is 25%) indicated that increasing the cost of cigarettes would deter young people from smoking. Youth smokers at various HPB programmes have also indicated that they are more likely to quit smoking if the price of cigarettes was increased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The call for cigarillos to be sold in packs of no less than&nbsp;20 will certainly make them less affordable to youths and bring us a step closer towards reducing prevalence of tobacco use in our youths. I support such a call and I feel it is time for the Ministry to look into such measures as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth are very vulnerable to addiction, and the harm this brings about, as you know, is life-long. While several of the proposed amendments will help towards curbing tobacco use in our younger population, we need to continue to reach out to them and to the people who may have an influence over them to encourage a tobacco-free lifestyle as the desired norm. If anything, I urge the Ministry to step up its plans to further discourage tobacco use among the young.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>Column: 715<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Mdm Cynthia Phua for her kind words. Yes, it is good to be back alive. I went through a lot and while in the ward, I had the opportunity to speak to many fellow patients &ndash; quite a few of them were smokers. I did ask them what they plan to do now; whether they were going to stop smoking. Not 100% said definitively \"yes, I would stop it\". So you can see how addictive this product is. Those who have never lit up, please do not start. It is not worthwhile. Why kill yourselves? Going through a bypass is a trauma. At least for me, it is a life-changer. My diet, which has always been pretty disciplined, has now become even more austere. And yet, for some smokers who have gone through that, they still find it difficult to quit. So this poison is hard to ban since it has been around for so long.&nbsp; But let us try to protect our people as much as we can.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven Members have spoken on this Bill. Dr Lam gave us a very good account of the harm tobacco can bring. Mr Hri Kumar's very passionate speech struck a chord. I thank all Members. The common message is loud and clear &ndash; tobacco is harmful, so let us do our best to protect our people from its harm. So thank you to all Members for supporting this Bill.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will do what is practical to implement it effectively. First, many Members supported the ban on emerging tobacco products. Mr Seah Kian Peng's account of snus and other anecdotes is instructive. Let us not allow them to land here. However, Dr Lam and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef suggested that we do not ban such products entirely but to consider some of them as part of a \"harm-reduction strategy\" to help smokers quit smoking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think their intentions are good but I honestly have my doubts as to whether the suggestion will be effective because I have personal experience of such \"harm-<p align=left>Column: 716<p>reduction strategy\". The suggestion reminded me of our experience with Subutex.&nbsp; And it was the same argument&nbsp;&ndash; it was a theory from the West, maybe sponsored or motivated by companies which have financial interest in this, to say, \"Let's go all out to promote it, it's good. It will help the heroin addicts wean from heroin.&nbsp; It is less harmful, as switching from heroin immediately to zero is very hard, but with Subutex, it is more likely&rdquo;. Some of our regulators were persuaded by the argument and allowed it.&nbsp; This happened just not too long ago.&nbsp; The results were disastrous and several Singaporeans were hurt.&nbsp; It took the Ministry of Home Affairs and myself quite some time to reverse the policy and damages. But for some Singaporeans who were hurt, the damages were not reversible.&nbsp; I confess, I will be skeptical of this so-called harm-reduction strategy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A less harmful tobacco product is an oxymoron. I share Mr Hri Kumar's view on this subject and agree with his robust approach.&nbsp; In the 1970s, the tobacco companies introduced cigarettes purported to be \"low tar\", \"light\" or \"mild\" as safer alternatives.&nbsp; They promoted such cigarettes to smokers who had health concerns and were then thinking of quitting.&nbsp; These products rapidly gained market share.&nbsp; As a result, there was a net increase in cigarette consumption.&nbsp; Independent research later on showed that smokers compensated by smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef quoted a positive experience of snus in Sweden.&nbsp; Yes, we have come across such reports.&nbsp; The Swedish experience has never been replicated outside of Sweden, and I cannot help noting that snus is a Swedish product.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence is actually just the opposite, with the use of snus resulting in smokers becoming addicted to both cigarettes and snus.&nbsp; It is the same with <p align=left>Column: 717<p>Subutex and the addicts end up using both.&nbsp; More smokeless tobacco use does not mean less cigarette-smoking.&nbsp; It is not a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Smokers use smokeless tobacco products to tide over nicotine craving in places where smoking is prohibited while continuing to smoke in other places where smoking is allowed&nbsp;&ndash; this perversely reduces the impetus for them to quit smoking.&nbsp; Meanwhile, tobacco companies get to entice non-smokers to develop nicotine addiction, adding to their customer base.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said, our experience with Subutex as a \"less harmful heroin\" substitute is similar.&nbsp; Instead of reducing the number of drug addicts, we ended up with more.&nbsp; So our approval of Subutex upset our trend. MHA had been doing a wonderful job of bringing down the number of drug addicts. But after Subutex was introduced, it was a V-shaped recovery for the (illegal drug) industry.&nbsp; So I strongly advise against adopting such so-called harm-reduction strategy.&nbsp; I would keep an open mind but they would have to make a lot of effort to convince me otherwise from this position.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I agree with Dr Lam and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef that we should try to help smokers \"to gradually quit in a controlled manner\". There are proper ways to do so, one of which is through controlled Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) by following strict guidelines.&nbsp; We do not prohibit nicotine used in such a manner.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard Mr Alvin Yeo mention that before we ban new products, we should do proper assessment process and do objective scientific studies.&nbsp; My approach is this.&nbsp; I will be fair to the companies and, as I have said, keep an open mind.&nbsp; But you know my priority.&nbsp; My priority is the interest, the safety and the health of our <p align=left>Column: 718<p>people, not the financial health of the tobacco companies. On that point, I am clear.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, all the Members expressed concerns over the rising smoking prevalence amongst certain population groups, including the young, the ladies and the Malay community.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah's speech in Malay made a heartfelt appeal to the Malay smokers to think about the welfare of their children and to get them to stop smoking.&nbsp; I join her in this appeal&nbsp;&ndash; please be responsible parents, and usually the fathers, be responsible fathers.&nbsp; You are bringing up the next generation. If you cannot quit smoking, then, at least, at the barest minimum, do not smoke when at home or do not smoke when in the company of your kids.&nbsp; But the best is to be credible as a role model, you must walk the talk, quit smoking yourself for your own sake.&nbsp; I also thank Mdm Halimah for highlighting the harm pregnant mothers bring to their infants if they smoke.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the Members called for stronger smoking control measures.&nbsp; I agree entirely. We have implemented various programmes, and we will continue to try new ones. We will work with schools, religious institutions, employers, the charity sector and the community at large.&nbsp; I note Mdm Halimah's illustration of the Sheraton Towers as an exemplary employer who went the extra mile to get the employees to quit smoking.&nbsp; I applaud such employers and I urge more to join the movement.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard Mdm Cynthia Phua's call for schools to reach out to students who smoke and get them to quit.&nbsp; I appreciate her sharing several research findings done in schools overseas on effective counselling, including telephone counselling.&nbsp; I note her point that with teens, enforcement and penalty do not work as well.&nbsp; The psychology often works the other way.&nbsp; What is prohibited becomes highly valued. <p align=left>Column: 719<p>We try to tap on the young to guide us on how to reach out to their peers.&nbsp; I myself had conducted focus group discussions with young lady smokers.&nbsp; And I asked them, \"Don't you know this thing is harmful, it is poison?\" They know that. Knowledge is out there&nbsp;&ndash; they are not ignorant.&nbsp; So I asked them, \"Have you tried to quit?\"&nbsp; They said, \"Yes, many times.\"&nbsp; I said, \"Why did you fail?\"&nbsp; They said they tried a few weeks and some succeeded for a few months. But when their brother is smoking, their father is smoking, or their boyfriend is smoking, they find it very difficult to quit. So let me reiterate the point that adults should know better and especially parents who have brought a new generation into the world&nbsp;&ndash; please think about the welfare of your kids and try to be good role models.&nbsp; But this is obviously a complex issue as Assoc. Prof. Straughan has noted.&nbsp; One underlying cause could be the larger problem of some youths needing to embrace \"sub-cultures\" in order to seek \"affirmation from like-minded peers\".</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will definitely try to do more and learn from others. We have discussed the various initiatives in this House before.&nbsp; So, in the interest of time, I do not intend to repeat them here.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts have not been futile.&nbsp; Let me quote one indicator. The proportion of secondary school students who have ever tried cigarette-smoking has actually dropped from 26% 10 years ago to 16% now &ndash; a 10-percentage point drop.&nbsp; It is not a great victory but a victory nevertheless. We certainly need to do better.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Ms Ellen Lee, Mdm Halimah and Assoc. Prof. Straughan called for stronger enforcement against sales to the under-age.&nbsp; I agree and I intend to do so. We will step up policing on tobacco retail outlets. We will consider raising the penalty on repeat offenders. We are also considering disallowing tobacco sales in outlets which <p align=left>Column: 720<p>are clearly meant to serve the young in other products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, Dr Lam asked about Singapore's compliance with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and whether we have been tardy.&nbsp; To date, we will be the third country in the world to fulfil all the obligations on tobacco labelling should this Bill be passed.&nbsp; Yes, there had been some delay, but I do not think it was a major delay. Dr Lam wondered whether this delay was a cause for the increase in smoking prevalence here. I doubt it. We have actually been ahead of the curve in tobacco control and, in any case, were largely FCTC compliant right from the start.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam asked if we should give tobacco companies more than 12 months to implement the changes to tobacco product packaging. We did not choose 12 months arbitrarily but&nbsp;because we have done it before when we introduced the requirement that they must display the health warning graphics.&nbsp; We gave them 12 months and they were able to comply.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate Mr Sin Boon Ann's very thoughtful piece on lateral advertising, latent marketing and advertising through the Internet.&nbsp; Earlier, Mr Calvin Cheng made a similar observation.&nbsp; Indeed, these are the innovations that tobacco companies are mounting to get round the FCTC and it is also a hot topic currently being discussed and brainstormed among international regulators including ourselves.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not yet have all the answers to these challenges.&nbsp; In fact, we may never be able to find full complete solutions to some of these challenges, for example, Internet advertising.&nbsp; How do we censor scenes of modern day James Dean smoking a particular brand of cigarettes?&nbsp; I myself have not noticed Mr Sin's observation that Mark Lee seems to be particularly fond of Marlboro cigarettes but I would have a quiet word with him the next time I meet him.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 721<p>Where we can, we should act. For example, we have removed the exemption for congratulatory messages and sponsorship publicity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar has described past misleading behaviours by tobacco companies; in fact, unethical behaviours by such companies.&nbsp; I agree with his observations.&nbsp; From a public health perspective, misleading terms are just as misleading, even if they are part of a trademark. Mr Alvin Yeo raised a couple of legal queries on this.&nbsp; Let me state clearly that we intend the new section 17A to affect trademarks if they contain misleading descriptors. We are not going to exempt them.&nbsp; We are fully aware of our TRIPS and other international obligations and we have consulted the relevant legal authorities extensively on this point. The proposed section 17A is aligned closely to the FCTC and will not violate Singapore's international obligations. We are in good company:&nbsp; the European Union prohibits misleading terms and descriptors even if they are a part of the trademarks or brand names.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, there were some comments which do not pertain to the proposed amendments in the current Bill.&nbsp; Let me briefly address them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee and Mr Hri Kumar made a plea on behalf of non-smokers and especially innocent children, from the effects of second-hand smoke from inconsiderate neighbours and irresponsible parents.&nbsp; Ms Lee asked the NEA to widen the outdoor smoking ban to include more common places in HDB towns, such as void decks and common corridors. I will raise her suggestion with the NEA.&nbsp; It is convenient that Minister Yaacob is my neighbour in Parliament.&nbsp; In fact, I had a word with him just now precisely about this point.&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar asked rhetorically how we could extend the law to the <p align=left>Column: 722<p>privacy of the home in order to protect the children from second-hand smoke.&nbsp; He knew it was outside my purview but I note his point.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Members may recall that in 2008, Parliament approved the Moneylenders Bill to revamp the regulatory regime for moneylenders.&nbsp; The purpose was to introduce a more flexible and progressive approach to the regulation of moneylending to keep pace with the modern credit economy.&nbsp; Following this, the number of moneylenders licences has increased significantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there has been an increasing number of HDB flat owners borrowing from moneylenders and agreeing to assign the sales proceeds from their flats as repayment.&nbsp; These moneylenders then lodge caveats against the flats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds. &nbsp; In 2008, there were 12 registered resale applications with caveats lodged by moneylenders.&nbsp; In 2009, the figure increased to 546.&nbsp; In the six months of this year alone, there were 556 such cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this is permitted under the current legislative framework, the Government is concerned about this trend as it undermines the intention of the home ownership policy which seeks to provide a home for our people for long-term stay. &nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 724<p>Mdm Halimah Yacob raised similar concerns in Parliament in April this year.&nbsp; And I informed her at that time that my Ministry was reviewing this issue, and that we would be treating it with utmost urgency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Bill is to address this problem.&nbsp; I have introduced it with a Certificate of&nbsp; Urgency to quickly put in place the legislative framework to prevent more HDB flat owners from ending up with caveats on their flats, after borrowing from moneylenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Emphasis on long-term home ownership</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before we get into the details of the Bill, let me remind Members what HDB flats are primarily intended for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A HDB flat is for long-term home ownership.&nbsp; I cannot over emphasise this fact.&nbsp; HDB flats are heavily subsidised to allow families to purchase and own their homes.&nbsp; Owning&nbsp;the roof over one's head is a significant commitment for any family and requires the family to be financially prudent and responsible to service their mortgage and plan for the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Government's part, we give generous subsidies to help young families and first-timers own their homes.&nbsp; As the flats and precincts grow older over time, we carry out upgrading and various improvement works at low cost or no cost to flat owners to help maintain the value of their flat. &nbsp; And finally, at old age, and this is where the long-term aspect of home ownership becomes crucial,&nbsp;flat owners can monetise their flats.&nbsp; They can supplement their retirement income either by subletting their flat, or a room, or by right-sizing to a smaller flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This life-cycle approach to housing works only if people do not cash out on their retirement asset prematurely.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will become homeless, if they have sold their flat and have not planned for where <p align=left>Column: 725<p>they are going to stay next.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also have whittled away their retirement nest egg.&nbsp; People are especially tempted to do this when flat prices are high.&nbsp; Selling their HDB flat prematurely, whether to cash in on its rising prices or to settle debts, is not a wise move, unless they have other housing options.&nbsp; It can only lead to bigger problems in the longer term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Singaporeans use their flats as collateral to borrow, they risk losing their homes if they default on their loan.&nbsp; Since 1994, the Government has disallowed the re-mortgage of HDB flats, except for the purpose of financing the purchase of the flat.&nbsp; There have been periodic call for this rule to be relaxed, but we have decided after careful consideration not to do so.&nbsp; In view of recent developments, we need to do more to protect the homes of Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Disallowing caveats pursuant to use of HDB flat as security</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the current rules, moneylenders can enter into an agreement with the HDB flat owners for the sales proceeds to be assigned to them as repayment of debt,&nbsp;upon which the moneylenders then lodge&nbsp;caveats against the flats.&nbsp; Such caveats enable the moneylender to determine repayment owed before he agrees to withdraw the caveat to allow the sale transaction of the flat to go through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that once the flat seller has sold off his flat and repaid the moneylender, he cannot afford to purchase his next flat.&nbsp; The flat seller and the other flat occupiers become homeless and pose a burden to their family and friends for their housing needs and some join HDB's queue for rental flats, when they in fact do not qualify for rental housing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 726<p> Against this context, we have decided to go one step further now and disallow the lodging of&nbsp;caveats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds of the flat.&nbsp; And this is the focus of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill 2010 that is before this House now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill 2010</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, section 51 of the Housing and Development Act only provides that the title deeds of HDB flats cannot be used to create a security for debt.&nbsp; Section 51 does not prevent moneylenders from lodging caveats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds, after providing a loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill repeals the existing section 51 and re-enacts the section.&nbsp; It continues to disallow HDB flat owners from using their HDB flat as security or collateral for any debt, or obligation, or claim.&nbsp; One key difference with this new clause is that this prohibition now includes the sales proceeds from the HDB flat.&nbsp; The re-enacted section 51 also implements a new rule that voids any contract or agreement to use HDB flats, including the sales proceeds, as security or collateral.&nbsp; The changes do not affect banks and financial institutions, who can continue to grant loans on the security of the flat for the purpose of financing its purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides providing that any contract using the HDB flat as security for debt is null and void, the Bill also provides that any Act, deed, instrument or document which protects rights under such a contract has no effect.&nbsp; This means that caveats against HDB flats for the payment of debt can no longer be lodged after the Bill is enacted.&nbsp; Existing contracts with valid caveats lodged would not be affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in recognition of the sanctity of contracts that are already legally entered into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Financial prudence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 727<p> Sir, this policy change does not mean that HDB flat owners can no longer borrow from moneylenders.&nbsp; They can continue to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they cannot use their HDB flat&nbsp;as a security, and they must find other ways to ensure that they repay their debts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preventing moneylenders from lodging future caveats against HDB flats, we are emphasising &ndash;&nbsp;and re-emphasising in fact this fact&nbsp;&ndash; that the HDB flat is meant for home ownership and it is a long-term asset for retirement.&nbsp; It is not to be used for short-term profit-taking or to cover debts.&nbsp; The new section 51 underscores this point, and it is urgently needed to curb future abuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am also taking this opportunity to introduce in the Bill two unrelated operational amendments to allow HDB to discharge its statutory duties better.&nbsp; Clause 4 aligns HDB's punitive powers for public rental flats with that of sold flats.&nbsp; It allows for subsidiary legislation prescribing penalties for those who illegally sublet their public rental flats,&nbsp;in the same way that penalties can be prescribed for flat owners who do not comply with conditions relating to flats sold by HDB.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, for misuse of public rental flats such as illegal subletting, the only recourse is for HDB to take back the rental flat and to debar the tenant for a fixed period.&nbsp; HDB has no further powers beyond this.&nbsp; Their experience shows that taking back the rental flat and debarring the tenant is not a sufficient deterrent.&nbsp; This amendment will allow HDB to impose penalties and more effectively safeguard the heavily-subsidised rental flats for those who really need them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, clauses 2 and 3 amend the Housing and Development Act to allow HDB to provide much sought after <p align=left>Column: 728<p>technical and consultancy services, locally and internationally, on matters within its expertise.&nbsp; The amendments also allow HDB to act as a Government's agent to service request, to share its expertise in public housing development, both within and outside Singapore.&nbsp; HDB would also be able to develop, sell and acquire intellectual property rights on a commercial basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All because I think the Ministry clearly believes there is an urgent need to protect the interests of our HDB flat owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year, I had raised my concerns over the antics of moneylenders who had used their borrowers&rsquo; HDB flats as collaterals.&nbsp; Although this practice is legal, it is clearly contrary to our home ownership goals, as Mr Mah has clearly pointed out,&nbsp;and unconscionable, and this Bill now rectifies this situation.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Section 51 now makes any contract or agreement to directly or indirectly use protected property as security or collateral for any debt obligation or claim null and void.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the situation is really serious.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister Mah had mentioned, there were only 12 resale flat applications with caveats lodged by moneylenders for the whole of 2008 but this has exploded to 556 applications for the first six months of this year alone. Even with so much <p align=left>Column: 729<p>publicity and warnings that such unethical practices should stop, without a law prohibiting them,&nbsp;moneylenders have continued to lure borrowers by&nbsp;using their flats as collaterals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This irresponsible behaviour of some licensed moneylenders had caused grave hardship to many.&nbsp; They use hard sell tactics such as advertising in newspapers as well as making use of housing agents&nbsp;to get&nbsp;more borrowers.&nbsp; Often, the borrowers do not clearly understand how the interest rates are computed and that there are other hidden costs, such as commissions paid to the housing agents to secure a borrower for the moneylender or legal fees, administrative costs&nbsp;and other costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, instead of just the 1.5% interest that was touted before they took the loan, they ended up paying as much as a 15% interest&nbsp;in some cases.&nbsp; Their shock starts when they discover that they had nothing left after paying off their debts to the moneylenders, which they had to first clear&nbsp;since it is protected by the caveat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many moneylenders actively seek out and pay housing agents commissions to secure borrowers for them from among those who want to sell their flats but who need immediate cash as the sale transaction may take up to six months to complete.&nbsp; We all know that ultimately it is the HDB flat seller who is paying for the commission offered by the moneylender to the housing agent, and this adds to the flat seller's debt.&nbsp; I was told that housing agents are paid 3% commission on every loan that they help to secure.&nbsp; So for a loan of $20,000, for instance, the housing agent can earn a commission of $600 per month for up to six months, a very lucrative sum for very little effort.&nbsp; Most of the borrowers are low-income earners who mostly borrow amounts of between $10,000&nbsp;and $20,000 but end up paying much, much more than this amount when they sell their flats.&nbsp; I&nbsp;recall a case that was reported in the media of a <p align=left>Column: 730<p>Mr Rahim, a cleaner, who received only $250 from the housing agent, which the housing agent described as a donation to him, after the sale of his 3-room flat&nbsp;in Yishun last November.&nbsp; The 46-year old man had to camp at East Coast Park as he could not afford to buy a smaller flat as there&nbsp;was nothing left from the sale of his flat nor could he rent from the private market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am really worried, Sir, that these 556 cases registered in the first six months of this year will be the cases that we will see at our Meet the People sessions asking for yet another loan from the HDB that they cannot afford to pay for or for a rental flat that they do not qualify for.&nbsp; In the end, the real victims will be the children.&nbsp; I have seen many&nbsp;of them, who are moved like nomads from place to place, relative to relative, until their parents outlive their welcome and whose studies are completely disrupted.&nbsp; There is no doubt that this exploitation of the current loophole in our law by moneylenders, have contributed to the problem of homelessness in Singapore.&nbsp; Although I know that this law cannot have retroactive effect, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is anything that the Ministry&nbsp;can do to help these 556 cases, in terms of&nbsp;negotiating for lower interest rates or&nbsp;mediating between them and the moneylenders.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also feel that there is a clear need to raise the standards of professionalism and ethics among housing agents.&nbsp; MND has announced that a new statutory board will be established to oversee the real estate landscape.&nbsp; This is sorely needed as it is obvious that the industry cannot regulate itself.&nbsp; Even housing agents&nbsp;who have been convicted of offences related to property deals can freely advertise and continue as agents after their release without any consequences whatsoever.&nbsp; The barriers to entry are non existent.&nbsp; Anyone who signs up with an agency is allowed to sell homes almost immediately.&nbsp; I was told that even foreigners who can <p align=left>Column: 731<p>barely speak English, and who would therefore not be in a position to properly advise their clients on the option form or the sales and purchase agreement, have jumped onto the bandwagon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practice, few agencies are prepared to sack an unethical but high performing agent because they bring in good money for the agencies.&nbsp; Such situations of conflict do not augur well for the industry and significantly compromises the interest of flat owners. So, I would like to ask the Minister when this statutory board will be set up and how soon will&nbsp;regulations be formulated to control the unethical conduct of&nbsp;real estate agencies?&nbsp; I really believe that the moneylenders acting alone would not have resulted in 556 applications caveats being lodged.&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly must be working together with the housing agents and therefore we really need to look at the issue in a wider perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, we cannot completely absolve flat owners who borrow from moneylenders from responsibility.&nbsp; They have caused much hardship to themselves and their family through their own actions and for which they must bear some responsibility.&nbsp; Even as I urge the Ministry&nbsp;to focus on flat owners' education as an integral part of our home ownership scheme, so that they understand that flats are meant to be long term investments for their security and old age, I do realise that no amount of education can stop flat owners from selling&nbsp;their flats and using it to finance their other needs or uses, if they so insist.&nbsp; Ultimately, borrowers must understand that the Government cannot free them from their legal obligation to repay the debts which they have incurred.&nbsp; In this case, the law can only disallow the use of the HDB flat or sale proceeds from being&nbsp;used as collateral for the loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB knows of many instances where home owners incur debts with other creditors, such as credit card companies, and sell <p align=left>Column: 732<p>their flats as a way to settle their debts and they end up&nbsp;with bigger&nbsp;problems as they do not have alternative accommodation.&nbsp; So, flat owners must accept personal responsibility and exercise financial prudence in whatever lifestyle choices that they make.&nbsp; They too have a duty to protect the roof over their heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with a strong emphasis on the importance of viewing HDB flats as a long-term investment.&nbsp; And I am really happy that this Bill will send a very strong signal to flat owners as well as to moneylenders and others who are interested, that they should similarly view the flats that&nbsp;they have as a very important shelter for&nbsp;them and&nbsp;their family.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I&nbsp;support this Bill, and I once again thank the&nbsp;MND for its quick response to protect our flat owners.</p><p></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.38 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the HDB (Amendment) Bill seeks to prevent caveats from being lodged against HDB flats and the proposed restriction to disallow HDB flat owners from using their flats as security for any debt, obligation or claim.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to commend the Ministry for taking quick action in responding to the issue of moneylenders issuing loans to home owners who use their HDB homes as collateral for easy cash to support lifestyle choices rather than for the purpose of financial exigencies for livelihood.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This loophole needs immediate plugging, given the exponential increase in the cases reported since 2008 till to date.&nbsp; Sir, according to press reports, these moneylending activities have been targeted specifically and openly at \"HDB home sellers only\", sometimes with the connivance of housing agents.&nbsp; Mr David Poh, the President of the Moneylenders Association of Singapore, had openly stated that it is not so secure for <p align=left>Column: 733<p>moneylenders to provide a loan based on the lenders' income as there is a possibility that they may also lose their jobs anytime.&nbsp; Mr James Lee, founder of James Lee Credit, also said that this is a \"legal process that is all in black and white\", further illustrating the current legal loophole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what complicates the issue is that the moneylending industry is not the only one that is under scrutiny here.&nbsp; Real estate agents also work hand in hand. They would introduce&nbsp;flat sellers, sometimes desperate sellers, to the moneylenders and then get a referral fee of about $500 in return.&nbsp; Housing agents may claim that the sum may not be big and it is up to the home owners not to go through with the arrangement.&nbsp; But home owners, saddled with mounting debts, may see this collusion as the easy way out without realising the implications.&nbsp; Hence, it is obviously a win-win situation for both the moneylender and the estate agent but what of the poor home owner who may stand to lose all.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Tan Tee Khoon, CEO of the Singapore Accredited Estate Agencies that estate agents have to satisfy several duties, one of which is to help HDB sellers work out their estimated sales proceeds before selling, a practice prevalent among financial planners.&nbsp; Agents also have the duty to advise sellers to plan for their next home before selling the flat.&nbsp; Sir, the amendment emphasises the need for flat owners to be responsible and prudent in their financial planning and well-being which otherwise would become a burden for society.&nbsp; Very often, flat owners resort to moneylenders and go on credit with credit cards, handphone subscriptions and hire purchases to service a highend life style with scant consideration for their housing loan obligations.&nbsp; Once heavily in debt, <p align=left>Column: 734<p>they turn to the moneylenders resulting in the predicament that many face today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, house owners should be cautioned against joining the bandwagon in this hot property market to make profits from the sale of their HDB flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;They then find themselves landing up in interim public rental housing or private rental flats, which quickly deplete the gains made from the sale of their HDB flats.&nbsp; They&nbsp;then&nbsp;join the&nbsp;queue at the Meet-the-People Session (MPS)&nbsp;to ask for heavily subsidised public rental flats.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to draw the Ministry's attention to the root of this entire moneylending issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask ourselves, why were the moneylenders able to attract these voluntary HDB sellers?&nbsp; Sir, I am sure that no HDB owner would want to put a flat down as security for such debts unless there is no other way out and that there is an extremely urgent need for cash, in some cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Save for the compulsive gamblers and those with unnecessary credit-card debts, some may actually have a valid and urgent reason to borrow cash.&nbsp; For instance, this may include the need to pay for an expensive operation or medical treatment.&nbsp; Of course, there could be a million endless possible reasons for borrowing cash, such&nbsp;as loss of jobs or death of the sole bread winner but the bottom line is whether there are other avenues for&nbsp;thrift loans to help these people who are in genuine financial need.&nbsp; Accordingly, would it be necessary to first find out how many such HDB owners have actually borrowed from moneylenders and the reasons for borrowing?&nbsp; Would HDB extend beyond the current practice of two concessionary loans for hardship cases?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask Minister what time frame is given to honour the existing contracts between the flat owners and moneylenders and for the group that is affected after the time period,&nbsp; how would the Ministry be helping the flat owners in fulfilling the payment of their outstanding <p align=left>Column: 735<p>loans to the moneylenders, especially in cases where they have borrowed because of&nbsp;financial circumstances and not so much as to support lifestyle choices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, this is not a one-dimensional problem.&nbsp; A proper solution should involve many parties, namely the moneylending industry, the real estate industry, HDB home owners and HDB itself.&nbsp; Sir, the proposed changes are to be welcomed, as they are in line with the policy concerns and purpose behind HDB flats.&nbsp; These flats are certainly not meant for short-term profit, nor to be&nbsp;used as security for any debt, obligation or claim.&nbsp; Rather, HDB flats are built to provide affordable homes to Singaporeans and to provide for them in their old age.&nbsp; Sir, with reference to clause 4 of the proposed amendments, the current penalties for illegal subletting of public rental flats, I support the move to take more stringent measures against lessees who abuse heavily subsidised public rental housing.&nbsp; But I would like the&nbsp;Minister to enlighten us on&nbsp;what these more stringent measures are all about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to also ask Minister how many cases of illegal subletting public rental flats is HDB dealing with to date and how many lessees have been evicted?&nbsp; For those evicted or to be evicted and who are not able to find another affordable lodging, how is HDB helping them?&nbsp; Other than evicting, are there any other measures that HDB is taking with regard to counselling and educating them on their responsibilities?&nbsp; Very often, we see these evicted cases at MPS where they threaten to bring the family to sleep at the beach or at the void decks, giving the impression that HDB is heartless when in actual fact HDB&nbsp;has compassion for those in need.&nbsp; Perhaps HDB should not shy away from doing more PR&nbsp;work&nbsp;of what it has been doing&nbsp;to help the homeless in need of public housing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 736<p> Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill allow HDB to provide its much sought-after technical and consultancy services internationally.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This is a remarkable achievement which all Singaporeans should be proud of. I would like to ask if there are any plans for HDB to collaborate with our local SMEs in the construction and other related industries, which wish to internationalise. &nbsp;Such partnerships would enhance the competitiveness and status of our SMEs and may also help create a local MNC by levelling up the expertise, as set forth in the ESC recommendation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.46 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I endorse the move by the Minister to plug the holes so as to suffocate these loan sharks from their wicked activities. It is commendable that the Minister is moving the Bill on a certificate of urgency. I applaud the Minister and his team. We can see there is a certain level of sophistication by these illegal moneylenders and they know where to look for the jugular veins to satisfy their needs. The damage inflicted by these loansharks hurt more than just the borrowers. The injury is inflicted on innocent neighbours as well. Hence, I am all for the Government&rsquo;s action to weaken these syndicates and their henchmen.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stand here to speak in support of the Bill, I would also like to ask HDB to do more to help residents who are in dire needs by taking a more generous stance to request for rental flats. HDB should look through its policy and see how to allow more applicants to qualify for such flats, particularly those who are in urgent need, such as those whose marriages have broken up and are saddled with many children. Another suggestion is for HDB to review its current list of occupiers of rental flats and get those who no <p align=left>Column: 737<p>longer require their flats, perhaps because their financial or social circumstances have improved, to move on so as to create more units available for more urgent cases. This can help shorten the waiting time for applicants.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the public standpoint, it is an irony to see foreign workers happily tucked into HDB blocks which have been turned into foreign workers dormitories, but Singaporeans are left hanging out on the waiting list.&nbsp; I know there is a difference between foreign workers&rsquo; dormitories and HDB rental flats. However, it is the public&rsquo;s perception of HDB policy that I am concerned about. From the public standpoint, why are flats turned into dormitories when HDB says it does not have enough units for Singaporeans? Why did HDB not, in the first instance, turn these blocks, for example in Toa Payoh, into rental flats to provide shelter to those Singaporeans who genuinely need them? Why can the Ministry not consider converting some other old buildings into temporary HDB rental housing for Singaporeans, if it can respond so swiftly to convert disused school buildings into offices when there was a demand?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the move to allow HDB to offer its technical and consultancy services abroad and locally and take on commercial jobs, I must register my concern on this point. I will first declare my interest as a professional engineer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think for HDB to take this journey is to side step its original noble mission to build and provide Singaporeans with affordable housing, and to build townships for the people. The \"people\" here refers to Singaporeans. If HDB is allowed to move away from its core responsibilities, then what is there to stop every Government or statutory agency to go into commercial business? Ultimately, <p align=left>Column: 738<p>the focus of the top brass will be on generating income which will pay them fat bonuses, rather than in channelling their minds to seeking solutions for local residents. This is inevitable. There are lessons to take home from what happened to Wall Street head honchos whose focus was on getting the big bucks at the expense of all other considerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at some of our transport operators. They are going the way of Wall Street. What happens? Local people are not served to satisfaction. More and more space in MRT stations have been converted to income-generating commercial space at the expense of the comfort of commuters.&nbsp; Fares continue to increase though the company makes more money and pays out fat bonuses to the top brass. After securing a stable home-based customer to guarantee regular revenue, they begin to lose sight of their original mandate. Anyone would, too, if this is the way to earn big bonuses and pay cheques. Yes, there are Singapore companies that have ventured abroad though they originally started as local enterprises. Perhaps PSA is one good example; SATS is the other; but these are different entities. Their basis is not to serve the Singapore population as HDB is required to do so.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the original intention of shedding a big chunk of HDB staff to set up Surbana Consultants? Can Surbana not do the job of providing international consultancy? If HDB is so keen to share its expertise and experience, then why not transfer its knowledge to local engineers and architects who are bidding for overseas projects? This, I think, would be a better way for HDB to impart its know-how to help local professionals venture abroad. At least we know at the same time HDB is helping to build a talent pool in public housing and township management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to seriously urge HDB to be focused in providing a roof to all <p align=left>Column: 739<p>Singaporeans and to do it well, without the leaking roofs.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.53 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100719/20100719VS_115350.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.]&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, HDB has been implementing the \"Home Ownership\" policy which aims to provide a good home for everyone and to meet Singaporeans' aspiration of owning their own property assets. Currently, 85% of Singaporeans have benefited from this policy and HDB has provided more than one million HDB flats to Singaporeans.&nbsp; This is a unique achievement, thanks to HDB&rsquo;s efforts of providing nice homes to our people for the last 50 years.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Singaporeans, an HDB flat is not only an important asset which appreciates over time but it also provides security for old age. As such, Singaporeans generally would not take the risk of mortgaging their HDB flat. Yet in 2008, 12 HDB residents mortgaged their flats and were forced to sell because they were unable to pay their debts. As a result, they became homeless. In 2009, the number rose to a staggering 546 cases. Although this number is negligible compared to the one million HDB flats that we have, we have to take precautionary measures. I must applaud the HDB for making fast and decisive moves to amend this law. Hence, I support this Amendment Bill. <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Amendment Bill may not address the root cause of this problem. The reason why Singaporeans resort to mortgaging their HDB flat is that they have to raise money when facing financial difficulties. They are not able to get a loan from the bank, nor can they borrow from their friends or relatives. They have no choice but to make a risky decision by turning to moneylenders. In order to help Singaporeans in such predicament, I have the following three suggestions:</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 740<p> Firstly, the Government should provide more ComCare fund to help those residents who are really in financial troubles and assist them to tide over the difficult times through proper channels. This will prevent them from making a wrong decision out of desperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we&nbsp;lack&nbsp;non-profit organisations to provide low interest loans for people who are in difficulties. I made the same suggestion during the Budget debate in 2008.&nbsp; In 1976, Bangladesh economist Muhammad Yunus set up a micro-credit bank called Grameen Bank for the benefit of rural residents, after seeing that they were exploited by loan sharks. In the beginning, people were laughing at him and thinking he would run into big losses by providing loans without collateral to the poor. But Grameen Bank proved to be a success and have maintained profits for more than 10 years. It has since become a model of combining profit-making with public interest. More than six million people have borrowed from the bank, and 58% of them, together with their family members, have risen above the poverty line. Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2006 because of this effort. I hope the Government would also set up micro-loan facilities to provide Singaporeans with an additional loan option. The <I>New Paper</I> had reported my suggestion positively at that time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB should also consider introducing a one-week cooling-off period for all HDB sales.&nbsp; During this period, HDB should consult HDB flat sellers and explain to them the relevant policies; for example, they cannot buy or rent an HDB flat within 30 months after they sell the flat and explain to them on the HDB&rsquo;s housing loan policy. After the cooling-off period, flat sellers can make a final decision. Some unscrupulous housing agents would use various means to persuade people to sell their flats in order to earn <p align=left>Column: 741<p>commission. They would tell the owners that should they have any problems, just see the MPs. As a result, many of our parliamentary colleagues have had to face many residents who had sold their flats hastily without realising the consequences. I hope that the Minister would consider my suggestion.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 835-838.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.58 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100719/20100719VS_115450.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.]&nbsp; I fully support the Minister for invoking the Certificate of Urgency to quickly plug the loophole in our current law and to prevent illegal moneylenders from filing caveats on HDB flats. I do hope this urgent Bill will be passed, because I do not want to see people losing the only shelter they have for their spouses, children and even parents by mortgaging their flats to illegal moneylenders. We must make sure that those illegal moneylenders do not walk away unpunished after they have exploited the borrower. At the same time, we must also ponder why these people resort to borrowing from illegal moneylenders.&nbsp;This is, of course, not HDB&rsquo;s problem alone.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope HDB can step into the home owner&rsquo;s shoes when formulating and implementing new policies.&nbsp;A case in point is the introduction of a new rule early this year whereby people who buy&nbsp;a second flat after selling the existing one can only use his remaining CPF and 50% of the cash proceeds from the sale. While I support this policy, many HDB owners and I are puzzled by its implementation timeline. Under the new policy, a person who sold his flat, for example, four years ago in 2006 and now wants to buy a new one will be required to use only 50% of cash proceeds from the last sale to pay for his new flat. This <p align=left>Column: 742<p>is unfair. When someone makes a sale four years ago, he or she did not expect to fork out 50% from the proceeds to pay for his new flat. He may already have spent the money on medical expenses, children&rsquo;s education and other expenses. He may not even have 10% of the proceeds left.&nbsp;I think this policy should apply only to flats sold&nbsp;after the policy took effect in March this year so that people can do their financial planning accordingly. Otherwise you are just laying a snare to trap them, forcing them to turn to the loan sharks.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <I>In English</I> ):&nbsp;Lastly, let us understand what HDB sets out to do. I quote briefly from the HDB website, the three key missions&nbsp;&ndash; one, \"providing&nbsp;affordable, quality homes for Singaporeans\"; two, \"ensuring vibrant towns\"; and, three, \"focusing on the community\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Bill, HDB is also seeking to go into sharing its expertise in public housing development outside of Singapore. It also wants to develop, sell and acquire intellectual property rights on a commercial basis. It was not long ago that the Ministry, after paying much retrenchment benefits, hived off Surbana and&nbsp;PWD, which has now become CPG,&nbsp;which is&nbsp;in the business of providing advice on technical and consultancy services, and on the development, upkeep and maintenance of housing estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also newly launched Singbridge International. Earlier, we had the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE). This is not HDB's core function. Surbana, I believe, was set up to fulfil this role of going overseas. Moreover, does HDB have adequate manpower resources to place such staff overseas? Most clients would want the consultants to be based there for a few years, and not travel there from time to time. Yes, HDB can share, teach or franchise its technical operations&nbsp;and other policy expertise and systems to <p align=left>Column: 743<p>organisations like&nbsp;Surbana, Singbridge and SCE, for them to do the work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB should, therefore, be better placed, to concentrate on what it is set up to do for Singaporeans &ndash; focus on building good and competitively-priced homes. It should not distract its staff and resources from its core functions. There are many issues which need to be resolved on the home ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB should channel its spare energy by focusing on promoting social graces and values amongst flat dwellers in highrise&nbsp;buildings, research and address issues like why flat dwellers are indiscriminately throwing food and other stuff out of the kitchen windows and&nbsp;soiling other's laundries.&nbsp;HDB can also conduct&nbsp;research on the lifestyles of the residents and, if need be, redesign the flats to address these problems. Look at the demand for more carparks. We have been appealing to the Ministry to look at that. We are getting more and more requests at the MPS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another feedback that we&nbsp;are receiving with increasing frequency from residents is noise from neighbours. Can we look at the concrete slab between flats and between the floors? Should we not use cell-blocks for slabs in between floors to reduce noise from passing through solid concrete? Japan is using this new technology. HDB should now concentrate on issues faced by residents in high-rise living. These are ongoing and changing. As the only public housing authority in Singapore, its responsibility to Singaporeans is heavy.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 839-840.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.&nbsp; <I><br></I> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not often that the passage of a Bill is sped through a Certificate of Urgency so that all three readings are <p align=left>Column: 744<p>effected in one parliamentary sitting.&nbsp;This attests to the urgency and seriousness of the problem at hand, namely, the increasing number of moneylenders giving loans to HDB flat owners at very high interest rates with the borrowers' flats as collateral.&nbsp;It also shows how decisively, determinedly and thoroughly MND is acting to nip the problem in the bud.&nbsp;I think the approach the Ministry is taking will be effective in curbing this unhealthy development and addressing the root of the problem. <I><br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, a number of unscrupulous moneylenders have been exploiting a loophole in our legislation.&nbsp; Presently, there is no restriction on the types of caveats that can be lodged.&nbsp;These lenders have hence made agreements with their borrowers to lodge caveats against their flats.&nbsp;This way, they have the first claim on the sales proceeds.&nbsp;It is all perfectly legal and above board; and the lenders have security in recovering the principle sums loaned plus an obscene amount of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April this year, the Minister, in response to Mdm Halimah Yacob, had mentioned that he was considering \"strengthening the regulatory framework to protect public interest\".&nbsp;However, the focus then was on regulating the real estate agents such lenders have colluded with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the introduction of clause 5 of the Bill, repealing the existing section 51 and enacting a new section 51, caveats can no longer be lodged against HDB flats for the payment of debt. Any contract using a HDB flat as a security or collateral for any debt other than as mortgage for the purpose of financing the purchase of the flat will be null and void. I agree with this approach for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it short-circuits the entire process of trying to catch the errant real estate agents and their partners&nbsp;&ndash; who <p align=left>Column: 745<p>are the moneylenders. Secondly, we address the issue of the moneylenders laying claim to the sales proceeds, protected by the law, as the loans are not secured on the flats. This is in line with the objective of public housing.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment Bill will ensure that HDB flats will continue to be used primarily as homes by HDB flat owners.&nbsp;Housing is one of the human race's four basic needs, succinctly summarised in a Chinese proverb&nbsp;\"<I>yi shi zhu xing</I> \"&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;clothing, food, housing and transportation.&nbsp;Without housing, it is difficult for one to hang on to a job or provide protection and stability for one's family.&nbsp;The Government set up HDB with the objective of housing every Singaporean. Affordable public housing has always been HDB's mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment will give effect to HDB&rsquo;s core mission of providing good quality and affordable public housing for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Not many other countries have achieved the rate of quality public housing that we have. More than roofs over their heads, HDB flats are also safe assets, stores of value which appreciate in value over time and provide security for retirement.&nbsp; Our HDB flats are well-maintained and upgraded regularly. Residents need not fear deterioration of their living environments as HDB continues to be committed to upkeeping and maintaining HDB flats and estates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, HDB flats should not be used as security or collateral for other loans or as instruments for profit by unscrupulous moneylenders.&nbsp;Such practices are clearly an abuse of the system and we must put an immediate stop to this.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I support the Ministry's decision to introduce an amendment through clause 4 to safeguard our heavily subsidised rental flats for the very poor and needy.&nbsp;The amendment will allow for <p align=left>Column: 746<p>subsidiary legislation to deter and punish those who are considering or who are already subletting their rental flats illegally. Such an abuse of our public rental housing system should not be tolerated as it deprives the truly needy as the errant tenants make a profit at the expense of the taxpayers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of this, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, I have a very specific clarification to seek regarding the proposed section 51.

I think there is one major component of this Bill <p align=left>Column: 747<p>and there are two minor components. Most Members have spoken in support of the first major component, ie, the provision to prevent moneylenders from lodging caveats on the proceeds. However some Members have reservations about the other aspects of the Bill which I will address later.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first address Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mdm Halimah's points. Specifically, their requests for details about existing caveats such as reasons why HDB owners borrow from moneylenders, the time-frame to honour such contracts and how my Ministry will be helping these flat owners with repayment of their debts such as mediating with moneylenders to reduce interest rates, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point I would like to make in respect to these comments is that the legislative changes&nbsp;that I am making today will not affect existing contracts with valid caveats lodged.&nbsp;This is an important point because I want to make sure that the sanctity of contracts that are already entered into legally is preserved. We cannot unilaterally change existing contractual rights for the parties involved. The Government cannot exempt borrowers from their legal obligations to repay their debts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also ought to clarify in case there is a misunderstanding&nbsp;&ndash; maybe Er Lee Bee Wah may have&nbsp;a wrong impression. This pertains to caveats lodged by licensed moneylenders. It does not deal with illegal moneylenders or loansharks. That is a totally different category altogether. In the first place, they do not enter into legally binding contracts. In the second place, they enforce their contracts in other ways, not in the ways that we normally think about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing is that the caveats that are lodged on the flats give moneylenders a right over the sales <p align=left>Column: 748<p>proceeds, only if the owner sells the flat. The moneylender cannot force the owner to sell his flat if he does not wish to do so. Of course, we all know that the flat sellers may then come under a lot of pressure to sell the flat to repay the loan if they have no other means to repay the loan and this is where the problem starts. So, that is the reason&nbsp;that the legislative amendments today are to prevent the use of HDB flats and its sales proceeds to be used as collaterals for the loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question then is,&nbsp;what about the existing caveats? This is the question that Mdm Halimah asked. Mdm Ho Geok Choo also asked who are these flat owners who borrow from moneylenders?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why do they borrow? What do they borrow for?&nbsp; I do not have data on why they borrow and what they are borrowing for. I think there are a variety of reasons why they do so but based on the cases that we meet at our meet-the-people sessions, the reasons vary.&nbsp; It could be to finance a business, it could be to pay for emergency expenses or it could be to pay for a lifestyle that they cannot afford or, worse still, to settle their gambling debts.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, I think it is important for flat owners to realise that they need to exercise financial responsibility and to live within their means.&nbsp; The HDB is not in the position to help them to settle their debts.&nbsp; What I am trying to do is to prevent more people from falling into debt and to lose their flats as a result.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, having said that, we have to sympathise with those who do fall into such difficulties for whatever reason.&nbsp; We do have a responsibility to guide them and point them in the right direction.&nbsp; We can&nbsp;offer or give them guidance and suggest to them, for example, to go for credit and financial counselling.&nbsp; We have various VWOs like the Credit Council of Singapore who do good work.&nbsp; They sit down with these people, advise them on how they can reschedule their debts and in some cases, I am told that the Credit Council of <p align=left>Column: 749<p>Singapore would also talk to the lenders to ask them to reschedule some of their debts or look for other ways of repayment.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is provided the borrowers are willing to go through this route and to subject themselves to some credit or financial counselling.&nbsp; Of course, those with financial difficulties have other avenues&nbsp;&ndash; we could refer them to CDCs.&nbsp; Perhaps they may be eligible for ComCare assistance or they may need a job if they are jobless.&nbsp; So there are other avenues that we can point them to for help but we are not in the position to help them to repay their debts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major point that was raised by Mdm Halimah and Mdm Ho Geok Choo is the role of real estate agents in this whole process. And I do agree that real estate agents play a very important role.&nbsp; They do facilitate it and they are, in some cases, the culprits in this whole process.&nbsp; It is important that we now urgently raised the professional standards and ethics of housing agents.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah specifically asked what measures my Ministry will be taking to prevent moneylenders from seeking out estate agents to secure borrowers, or <I>vice versa</I>, for real estate agents to recommend borrowers to moneylenders.&nbsp; I like to inform her that my Ministry will be introducing a Bill in Parliament soon to set up a new statutory board and this new statutory board will be called the Council for Estate Agents (CEA). I expect the CEA to be operational by the end of this year.&nbsp; With the setting up of CEA, we will be better able to protect public interests and raise the professional standards of the industry.&nbsp; We will do this by enhancing the licensing framework for the real estate agencies and we are also going to, for the first time, register estate agents.&nbsp; By tightening up the regulatory framework <p align=left>Column: 750<p>for the industry, we will be able to raise the standards of the industry and at the same time have a greater hold on both the agencies as well as the agents because we all know that estate agents play a very critical role in facilitating the whole property transaction process between buyers and sellers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estate agents have, in fact, a very critical role to play because many of the buyers and sellers are not sophisticated buyers and sellers. They need the estate agents to protect and promote their interests and to service them professionally and ethically. So clearly, there is a conflict of interests if we allow estate agents to be involved in moneylending because they will, then, not be able to fulfil their obligations to their clients when they also profit from moneylending activities.&nbsp; Under the new regime, we are going to prohibit estate agencies and agents from becoming licensed moneylenders or becoming their employees. Currently, they are allowed to.&nbsp; This is one of the steps that we are going to take under the proposed CEA regime.&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng also supported the Bill but he suggested putting in place a cooling off period to give flat owners more time to mull over their transactions.&nbsp; I will ask HDB to look into his suggestion.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I come to the other aspects of the Bill on which Members have raised queries.&nbsp; First of all, let me address Mdm Ho Geok Choo's point about illegal subletting of HDB flats. Mdm Ho asked about HDB's enforcement of cases of illegal subletting and how HDB will help those who are evicted, who are about to be evicted or who are not able to find affordable lodgings.&nbsp; She also asked about the number of illegal subletting cases.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point I want to make is that the tenants who sublet their rental flats&nbsp;&ndash; do not forget that they are given the opportunity to rent a HDB flat at highly-subsidised rentals, ie, $30 or $60 at <p align=left>Column: 751<p>most.&nbsp; Yet at the same time, they sublet this rental flat.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; It means that they are depriving other people in the queue, who are in greater need of a flat, from getting this flat and therefore, they are abusing these generous subsidies.&nbsp; Similarly, if they are able to sublet their flats, it means they have alternative accommodation.&nbsp; Why do they need a flat in the first place?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, HDB terminated the tenancies of 221 tenants. There were 221 cases of tenants who sublet their flats illegally.&nbsp; In 2009, there were 170 cases.&nbsp; In the first six months of this year, the cases have come down&nbsp;to 63 cases. I think this is the result of more publicity on illegal subletting.&nbsp; As I have said, the vast majority of those who sublet their flats actually have alternative accommodation.&nbsp; It is not as if they have no place to stay but there are a few who are in need of accommodation because they have no other housing options and HDB is prepared to help or has helped them on a case-to-case basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, that illustrates the point that Mdm Ho made.&nbsp; I thank her for her kind words about HDB's compassion.&nbsp; She recognises that HDB, in its own quiet way and without publicity, does help a lot of people who fall between the cracks. They help them, hold their hands, look at their cases compassionately but not all cases deserve this compassion. There are cases that we have seen who have been helped on many occasions and still come back looking for more help.&nbsp; I think in those cases, we have to be very careful that we are not creating a mentality of coming to HDB for help every time they run into trouble and not exercising personal responsibility.&nbsp; HDB has to be very careful when it exercises this compassion that Mdm Ho talked about, so as not to generate or create a mentality of being over-dependant on the HDB and the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; So families who are in need and who are deserving will be helped but <p align=left>Column: 752<p>they also need to exercise personal responsibility for their actions.&nbsp; Members may know that there is a whole array of counsellors in place at HDB branch offices that will help lessees look for alternative options, whether it is subletting, right-sizing, seeking advice on credit assessment, interim rental housing or in extreme cases, HDB rental housing.&nbsp; In other cases, counsellors will refer them to or link them up with CDCs for job matching, employment assistance and so on.&nbsp; So, there is a whole array of assistance measures that are being undertaken by a large group of what we call, housing counsellers, at the various HDB branch offices.&nbsp; If Members come across cases which require special help, they can either refer them to me or to my Ministry, either my Senior Minister of State or my Parliamentary Secretary, and we will see what can be done.&nbsp; That does not mean that every case that Members refer to us will be helped, but it does mean that we will look at the cases with closer scrutiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a bit of disquiet or reservation about one aspect of the Bill, which is the proposal to allow HDB to share its expertise outside Singapore. Er Lee Bee Wah and Mdm Cynthia Phua had some grave reservations about this, about allowing HDB to provide consultancy services outside Singapore and indeed, within Singapore.&nbsp; Their fear is that this will be at the expense of HDB's work locally.&nbsp; Let me assure both Members that this will not be at the expense of the work that HDB is doing.&nbsp; In fact, I am very clear that our primary responsibility, the main responsibility of HDB must be to its work here in Singapore and to the people here.&nbsp; I have absolutely no doubt about that and I have told HDB so.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have hived off Surbana to let Surbana do its work outside of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this provision is, from time to time, we do get requests from governments on a government-to-<p align=left>Column: 753<p>government basis, for HDB to do some consultancy work overseas.&nbsp; A good case-in-point is the Tianjin EcoCity project.&nbsp; Tianjin EcoCity project is a government-to-government project, a collaboration between the governments of Singapore and the PRC, to develop a township. Within this township, one of the aspects is the provision of a good public housing system.&nbsp; This is where HDB's expertise and consultancy are required.&nbsp; It is not so much in the planning of the town but the policies of HDB, ie, home ownership policies, rental policies, financing policies, what are the policies that have worked for Singapore and&nbsp;what are the policies that have not worked so well.&nbsp; This is the kind of expertise that we are trying to share with overseas governments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the local industry, yes, definitely, HDB plans to work with local companies, especially SMEs, on specific technical and consultancy services.&nbsp; It could be in environmental services, it could be in green buildings, it could be in solar panels, it could be in lifts, and so on. There are still specific areas that HDB may be required, from time to time, to share its expertise with others.&nbsp; This provision is to enable HDB to do so.&nbsp; Just to reiterate that it is not going to be a big money-spinner to make money for HDB.&nbsp; It is rather to generate a reservoir of goodwill on behalf of the Government with other governments or other institutions and, of course, also to keep our HDB officers involved with such efforts.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I thought I should reiterate that point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard what the Members have said, there are still a lot of things that HDB needs to do and, indeed, is doing.&nbsp; The role and functions of HDB continue to evolve over time and the nature of its work is going to change.&nbsp; It will move more and more away from hardware provisions, ie, the infrastructure provisions, into the softer social aspects. I must add <p align=left>Column: 754<p>that HDB will need to work with the Town Councils and the Advisors to make sure that all aspects of high-rise living continues to improve in Singapore and to make sure that our residents continue to, not just learn how to live in high-rise environment but how to live graciously.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have addressed most of the clarifications except for one where Ms Sylvia Lim asked a specific question.&nbsp; She asked why there is a need for an additional clause in section 51, clause 4 which reads, \"any person or persons belonging to a class of persons prescribed by the Minister as a person to whom, or a class of persons to which, subsection (1) will not apply\".&nbsp; I believe this is a general catch-all clause which we insert into the Bill that, from time to time, we may need.&nbsp; I am not able to tell you at this point in time who these people are but it does give us the flexibility, sometime in the future, to make these exemptions.&nbsp; So it is a catch-all clause to give the Minister flexibility.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to conclude by saying that the main purpose of this Bill is&nbsp;to emphasise that an HDB flat is a long-term asset, as well as a shelter. Flat owners should not willingly or too freely use it to cash out, to take loans to finance other things, even for very deserving uses.&nbsp; The HDB flat is not the cash cow that allows you to cash out and spend the money.&nbsp; The legislative changes that I have introduced today serve to emphasise this point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Sir, the Minister has not responded&nbsp;to my request to implement&nbsp;the policy allowing&nbsp;the use of 50% of&nbsp;cash proceeds from the sale of a flat to&nbsp;after March 2010, rather than going backwards.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, that has nothing to do with this Bill.&nbsp; But since the Member has asked, I will explain what I said in March this year when I introduced the <p align=left>Column: 755<p>new policy. At that time, if the Member recalls, the second concessionary loan was only automatically applied to those who upgrade to bigger flats.&nbsp; It did not apply to those who downgraded or those who moved laterally.&nbsp; At the time, I emphasised that the purpose of this change was to reinforce the principle of financial prudence. What we saw was that people were upgrading to get a loan even though they could not afford a bigger flat. So you had people moving from a four-room to a five-room flat and when you ask them why, they would say, \"Because the housing agent told me that this is the only way to get another loan from HDB.\"&nbsp; That was obviously a perverse incentive but what was the underlying premise behind it?&nbsp; The underlying premise was to be able to get a second concessionary loan from HDB.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have asked HDB, through this policy, to make sure that the next loan, ie, the second loan, is granted for a genuine purpose. That genuine purpose could be upgrading as your family grows larger and you can afford to do so, or it could be downgrading because you do not need a big flat.&nbsp; So a downgrader will also get the second concessionary loan.&nbsp; But the size of the second loan cannot be independent of the proceeds that he has got from selling the existing flat.&nbsp; It cannot be so because otherwise, this will become another perverse incentive where people will be upgrading and downgrading in order to automatically get another HDB loan.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have instituted this 50% rule.&nbsp; The 50% rule says that you must make use of the proceeds from the sale of your current flat, your CPF as well as your cash.&nbsp; And if you have enough CPF and enough cash to buy your next flat, strictly speaking, HDB should not grant you a loan.&nbsp; We have decided that we are not going to be so unreasonable but to be slightly more generous. We will allow you to keep 50% and use the other 50% of your proceeds plus your CPF towards the purchase of <p align=left>Column: 756<p>your next flat. When we compute the loan, we will take that into account. That is the rationale for that 50% withdrawal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Sir, I understand the policy.

The next question is, what is there to stop&nbsp;HDB management&nbsp;from providing consultancy services beyond policies?&nbsp; I mean, we are very clear of the role of HDB but what is there to stop the management team from deviating from the original role of HDB.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> In fact, there is a lot of value in HDB which I believe can be adopted by our local industries.&nbsp; Some SMEs may see HDB as a threat.&nbsp; What <p align=left>Column: 757<p>HDB is seeking to do is to work with the SMEs to try to develop new processes or systems.&nbsp; I did not want to go into the details but here is one example.&nbsp; HDB is working with some local partners, SMEs in fact, to transfer and share technical knowledge with them, in the hope that they will then pass this experience to the other SMEs. The SMEs can then use this for their overseas projects, ie, gain track record in Singapore for their overseas projects.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, there is a project called a pre-fabricated extensive green roof tray system (PEG). I do not know whether Members have seen it. These are the trays which we use for green roofs.&nbsp; It is a process that has been developed by HDB and NParks. They partnered a private company to jointly develop a modular tray that can be used to spread the green roof. So this is an example of the things that can be done.&nbsp; There are many other examples.&nbsp; The PEG system was awarded the silver award in the Enterprise Challenge.&nbsp; And now, having created a solution with HDB and NParks, this SME is going to export the PEG technology to other urban environments facing similar problems as Singapore. This is just one specific example of how we are trying to use HDB as a test-bed to help small companies and do more with them, create value for them and to export the value overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to assure Members that HDB's mandate is not to go out there and to become a company or to compete with local companies.&nbsp; The idea is to allow the management to do these things.&nbsp; There is really no reason for HDB officers to go into this.&nbsp; Their KPIs do not include how much money they make for these SMEs.&nbsp; Their KPIs are dependent on many of the things Members are talking about, ie how they can build a more vibrant community, how they can continue to provide more <p align=left>Column: 758<p>affordable housing and&nbsp;how they can continue to facilitate gracious living in HDB estates.&nbsp; Those are their KPIs, not this.&nbsp; But this is just an aside to allow them to do other things as well. Another assurance &ndash; if Members feel that HDB is over-stepping its boundaries in any area, they can let me know.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Before commencing my speech, I would like to convey my congratulations and gratitude to the Government for steering an impressive economic recovery &ndash; far exceeding expectations.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been and I foresee will continue to remain the most commonly used indicator of economic performance and growth.&nbsp;This speech will not contest that reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My intent in making this speech is to highlight that the changed circumstances today require a broader framework where policymakers have the benefit of being prompted by socio-economic indicators other than GDP.&nbsp;This helps us better address important issues that are not strictly economic in nature, such as aspirations, equity and happiness which in turn have an increasing impact on national goals such as sustained economic growth, <p align=left>Column: 760<p>productivity, innovation, work-life balance and, of course, procreation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this year&rsquo;s Committee of Supply debate, the Government made it clear that it no longer adopts a \"GDP growth at all cost\" approach.&nbsp; I am heartened by this assurance, and I have reason to believe that the Government is already looking at other indicators to ensure that negative externalities of policies and programmes are identified early and addressed or mitigated.&nbsp;The Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) also highlighted the importance of evolving a more qualitative, \"sustained economic growth\". However, its recommendations are still focused on economic growth and productivity which a growth-centred model tends to emphasise, with too little consideration of social and environmental factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is that if we do not develop a formalised framework for analysis, these other indicators will continue to play second fiddle to GDP, instead of being considered together with GDP and with the same level of importance.&nbsp;Sustained economic growth is necessary for job creation and employment which in turn is a key determinant of standard of living. This Government has delivered this consistently. Paradoxically, continued economic growth and progress over the years have resulted in the cause of the challenges we face today &ndash; balancing the needs of an increasingly educated and sophisticated populace with those from the middle- and lower middle-class sector who are struggling to match up and keep up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first 30 years of Singapore, the population was less bifurcated, socially and economically &ndash; so, GDP as a key indicator was sufficient. We just needed to grow fast, create jobs and build affordable houses. Today, it is no more about how fast we grow. Increasingly, it is about how we grow, where we grow,&nbsp;are we prepared to pay the price for <p align=left>Column: 761<p>growth,&nbsp;and whether we are growing together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all challenges that developed societies face &ndash;&nbsp;challenges of managing success. The GDP is not equipped to prompt us or provide answers in these increasingly critical areas.&nbsp;Worse is if we focus too much and for too long on the GDP, it could paint too rosy a picture &ndash; a false positive, so to speak&nbsp;&ndash; and distract us from these issues. The GDP is essentially a measurement of economic activity not economic benefit.&nbsp;Used on its own, it can be a misleading indicator of economic progress and welfare of the individual Singaporean.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while one cannot dispute the correlation between economic growth and standard of living, the GDP was never meant to measure the well-being of people.&nbsp;Simon Kuznets, one of the founders of the GDP calculations, made this quite clear, and I quote him, \"distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and the long run.&nbsp;Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GDP figures limit the assessment of both objective as well as subjective elements of well-being and development.&nbsp;Objective elements refer to issues of income distribution, purchasing power parity, per capita consumption, and wage shares. Subjective elements refer to issues such as health and mental well-being, life and job satisfaction, work-life balance, happiness and social and environmental capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that some of the socio-economic dysfunctions we see in Singapore today have been exacerbated by a combination of a strong focus on GDP growth and the inherent limitations <p align=left>Column: 762<p>and the skewing effects of the GDP figures. Let me highlight a few of these dysfunctions, by way of illustration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,&nbsp;let us look at some of the market-driven negative externalities that the GDP figures do not highlight.&nbsp;As I&nbsp;brought up in my speech made in this House last August, Singapore&rsquo;s per capita GDP has risen exponentially over the past 44 years. According to figures from the Department of Statistics, in Sing dollar and nominal terms, Singapore&rsquo;s per capita GDP grew from $1,567 in 1965 to $53,192 in 2008, certainly one of the highest in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when we look closer at what constitutes the GDP, there is cause for concern.&nbsp;According to data, profits take about 46% of Singapore&rsquo;s GDP, which according to the economists I spoke to, is extremely high compared to other developed economies. From what I understand, half of this high profit share is repatriated,&nbsp;ie, it goes to the coffers of foreign-owned companies with operations here.&nbsp;What is left in the GDP pie to directly benefit Singaporeans is therefore a relatively small amount. With such a significant amount of growth driven by foreign MNCs, the net welfare benefit to the average Singaporean is unclear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to&nbsp;economist, Manu Bhaskaran, and I quote, \"This could be why even though Singapore&rsquo;s per capita GDP is roughly 11% higher than Hong Kong&rsquo;s, our per capita consumption is about 21% lower that Hong Kong&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If we take per capita consumption as a better indicator of welfare, then simply going for high growth <I>per se</I> does not guarantee that we will achieve the best possible welfare outcome for Singaporeans\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if you look at the wage component of GDP, you will see that the Singaporean workers&rsquo; wages account for less than half of Singapore&rsquo;s GDP. In other developed countries, these wages <p align=left>Column: 763<p>take up more than half of the total GDP.&nbsp;In Singapore, wages account for about 43% of our GDP, compared to 58% in the USA and 57% in Japan,&nbsp; according to a report published by Singstat. This is due to a conscious effort by the Government to moderate wage increases to manage the cost of doing business here.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;cause of the low wage level&nbsp;in Singapore is the influx of foreign workers, which has had&nbsp;the effect&nbsp;of pushing wages down.&nbsp;I believe the Government is addressing these issues through our concerted efforts to boost productivity and innovation in the workplace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, our Prime Minister's recent statement in Huston indicating that with the blow-out economic growth rate, we would need another 100,000 foreign workers,&nbsp;is a cause for concern. It appears to go against to the ESC's recommendation to reduce our dependency on foreign workers and for good reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other area that the GDP figures tend to mask is income distribution &ndash; which for most developed, affluent economies remain a challenge.&nbsp;While we have one of the highest per capita GDP in the world, according to figures from the CIA World Factbook for 2009, Singapore ranks as one of the highest in the world in terms of income inequality.&nbsp;The Gini&nbsp;coefficient is the measurement of income inequality &ndash; the higher the Gini coefficient, the worse the level of inequality. Based on 2008 figures, Singapore has a Gini coefficient of 48.10 &ndash; which is much higher than other countries in Asia, including China, Malaysia and the Philippines. In fact, it would appear that Singapore is closer to many under-developed countries in the Gini coefficient. This should certainly be a cause for concern for us, but it will be red-flagged only if we pay enough attention, and prompt attention, to this indicator together with the GDP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 764<p> One evident cost when pursuing an economic growth-centred model is a possible short-sightedness that could lead to short-cut solutions.&nbsp;We lose peripheral vision, which is an important public policy imperative.&nbsp;Take the policy of importing foreign workers in large numbers into Singapore &ndash; something that we have only recently started putting the brakes on. Yes, our GDP has risen as a result of this policy but it has, over the years, systematically depressed wages of lower-skilled workers, and contributed to a surge in rental costs and inflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the economic growth-centred model focused on GDP can come at a social and ecological cost.&nbsp;Given that social and environmental factors such as work-life balance, job satisfaction and happiness have been proved to be essential especially in developed societies. For economic sustainability, it is necessary to stop seeing social and economic policies as tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the Kelly Global Workforce Index, for example. It measures work-life balance and the use of technology in countries. In 2009, it was stated that only 54% of Singaporeans are satisfied with their work-life balance, compared to 69% in the USA. We were even significantly lower than other Asian countries &ndash; India had 64% and Indonesia, 68%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Grant Thornton study in 2007 ranked Singapore sixth globally in terms of stress level of the population.&nbsp;In a 2009 survey conducted by Robert Half Singapore, a HR consultancy firm, Singapore ranked second lowest worldwide in terms of job satisfaction, with only 53% of respondents being satisfied with their work.&nbsp;From all this, it is clear that the equity versus efficiency debate needs to be adjusted from being a zero-sum issue to one of balance and complementarity. Economic growth and general well-being must be seen as equally important societal goals.&nbsp;After all, <p align=left>Column: 765<p>the end goal of economic policies should be to benefit the citizens and improve their well-being and give happiness. It is difficult, even for the best intentioned policy makers to develop this reflex, if the GDP remains the default indicator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in many ways the recent global economic meltdown has served as a wake up call for political leaders.&nbsp;It has sparked introspection and close examination of the systemic flaws in the way we manage economic growth, and consequently, the way prosperity is measured.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many eminent economists, for example, have pointed to GDP figures \"masking the true health\" of the economy in the lead up to and during the recent global economic crisis in the USA. They argue that if policymakers had focused on a broader set of indicators, there is a good chance the adverse situation would have been prevented, or at least managed better with early detection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, now in the USA, a new system of national measurements called the \"State of the USA\" has emerged, with several hundred new measures and indices pushed to policymakers, and at the same time made available to the public. The idea is for this to evolve into a \"national indicators panel\".&nbsp;President Obama&rsquo;s recently passed Healthcare Bill included a provision requiring Congress to finance and oversee the creation of a key \"national indicators system\". These indicators include crime, energy, infrastructure, housing, health, education, the environment, in addition to and interfaced with key economic indicators such as the GDP and consumption index.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is another proponent of this line of thought.&nbsp;He has argued passionately for an acknowledgement of the inherent <p align=left>Column: 766<p>limitations of the GDP as a policy tool for policymakers, as it focused primarily on what he terms \"material determinants of social welfare\". He calls for a \"broader measurement of human welfare\" which includes what he refers to as the \"economics of happiness\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the most noteworthy and thorough reports on the need for this shift in practice is the \"Report on Economic Performance and Social Progress\". This was commissioned by French President Nicholas Sarkozy in the aftermath of the global crisis that started in 2007.&nbsp;The Report states that conventional market-based measurements of income, wealth and consumption are insufficient to assess human well-being.&nbsp; It emphasised the need to give greater prominence to factors, such as income distribution, personal consumption and individual wealth, while assessing qualitative aspects such as health, education, the environment, employment, material well-being, interpersonal connectedness and political engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Report on Economic Performance and Social Progress\" was tabled at the 2009 G20 Summit in Pittsburg, USA. The leaders endorsed the need to include indicators other than the GDP to have a better measurement of progress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)&nbsp;is actively challenging the pre-eminent status of the GDP as the \"end all\" of all indicators.&nbsp;They strongly support the \"institutionalisation of a range of indicators\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Europe 2020 Strategy will see the European Commission monitor member states based on a set of indicators to track overall progress.&nbsp;The idea is not to lose the plot yet again.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Canada, the \"Canadian Index of Well Being\" measures social connections, <p align=left>Column: 767<p>in addition to standard of living, health, environmental quality, education and skill levels, and participation in the democratic process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what does all this mean for Singapore, which today is recognised as a developed society, aspiring to become a global city of excellence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased level of education and technology usage has made people more informed and exposed, and therefore demanding greater levels of transparency and accountability in seeking a better quality of life.&nbsp; Needs are shifting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing demand for information is linked&nbsp;directly to each individual's life and priorities.&nbsp; When the Government announces that the economy is recovering or doing well, people are asking how this is benefiting them directly.&nbsp; It is incumbent on the Government to make available broad information to facilitate informed decisions by the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, therefore, suggest a three-step approach for the Government to consider, with a view to evolving a new collective reflex in balancing economic growth with other goals that the people increasingly desire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First step,&nbsp;the Government should commit resources to ensure that we collect and collate information on what the people want&nbsp;&ndash; their priorities.&nbsp; It is evident that some of these determinants&nbsp;&ndash; job satisfaction, happiness, work-life balance, feeling connected, environmental degradation, pollution&nbsp;&ndash; are qualitative in nature.&nbsp; In economic parlance, they are non-market externalities.&nbsp; From what I understand, currently there is little available data on these factors, and it would appear they are not sufficiently accounted for in public policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Government should develop a framework for broad-based <p align=left>Column: 768<p>public policy analysis.&nbsp; It should create a mixed bag of social and economic indicators.&nbsp; This would be in line with the OECD recommendation of \"institutionalising a range of indicators\".&nbsp; Apart from the currently used key indicators of GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Industrial Production Index and Total Exports/Imports, we could consider including other economic indicators that measure median wages, income distribution, productivity, job satisfaction and household consumption.&nbsp; The new framework should also include indicators for quality of life and general well-being&nbsp;&ndash; a range of indices that measure income, public services, health, leisure, wealth, mobility, the environment and connectedness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts I have spoken to, especially economists and researchers, are in agreement that what we have at present is not sufficiently versatile to anticipate, unearth and red-flag problem areas.&nbsp; This is because problems are complex and multifaceted, and because we do not&nbsp;have enough data on non-market externalities, they do not&nbsp;appear on the radar screens.&nbsp; Even if these problems are identified, solutions tend to be shallow and technical in nature because we rely primarily on economic indicators.&nbsp; To get a clearer, more accurate resolution of the situation and the issues thereof, we need to study the mixed bag of indicators in combination and where possible how they interface.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;take the current challenge of boosting productivity in the workplace.&nbsp; A key solution is skills training and innovation, and rightly so.&nbsp; Another&nbsp;underlying problem is low job satisfaction, lack of ownership or empowerment, and poor work-life balance.&nbsp; Currently, these are&nbsp;indicators that are not readily available and therefore likely not to be given sufficient or prompt attention in addressing the productivity challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third step that I suggest,&nbsp;as in the case of the GDP and non-oil exports which is reported&nbsp;on a monthly basis,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 769<p>there should be quarterly or, at least, half-yearly &nbsp;reporting by the Government on a handful of new indicators, some measuring non-market externalities.&nbsp; Ideally, these&nbsp;should be&nbsp;aggregated or composite indices to measure&nbsp;productivity and job-satisfaction,&nbsp;household consumption,&nbsp;income distribution,&nbsp;welfare,&nbsp;quality of life and general well-being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I would like to acknowledge, once again, our admirable economic achievement over the past 45 years because of sound economic policies and good governance.&nbsp; What I am recommending is an improvement of a good system and practice as a necessary step in managing the success we have achieved&nbsp;&ndash; where a better educated, sophisticated people's needs have certainly moved up the value chain.&nbsp; It is about aligning our practices with the aspirations of today&rsquo;s Singapore residents, both the citizens and PRs.&nbsp; It is about moving in tandem with the best practices in other developed economies facing similar challenges&nbsp;&ndash; best practices that have evolved through learning from lessons from recent history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to view my observations with an open mind&nbsp;to see it not as a criticism of current practice but as a considered appeal for a review that will help provide greater clarity in policy formulation, resulting in policies and programmes that are likely to resonate better with the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the increased level of transparency and public disclosure is likely to result in more questions asked about the Government's policies and the considerations behind them.&nbsp; This inconvenience must be seen as an investment in building trust between the Government and the people, and evolving a more engaged society.&nbsp; This is necessary to help us move <p align=left>Column: 770<p>forward together even better, our priorities and goals synchronised.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Sir, let me start by assuring Mr Viswa Sadasivan that the Government values and appreciates constructive feedback on its policies. So, we take his comments seriously.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Mr Viswa that the development of a society cannot be predicated on pure economics alone.&nbsp; A responsible government takes a balanced approach towards developing a country, taking holistic account of its economic, social and security needs and&nbsp;with a steady eye toward the long-term, beyond the election cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policies are developed for the collective benefit of our citizens so that progress is broad-based and no single sector benefits at the expense of others.&nbsp; The ultimate aim is to enable our people to have a good quality of life and not merely a high standard of living.&nbsp; Hence, contrary to what the Member implies that the Government had hitherto been adopting, it has never been a GDP growth at-all-costs strategy.&nbsp; As Minister Mentor shared at a recent dialogue session held in conjunction with the Singapore International Water Week and the World's City Summit, even in our early days, when we were deprived, we were mindful not to allow heavy pollutive industries using old technology to set up base in Singapore to ensure a good quality living environment and sustainable development.&nbsp; Hence, even back then, we had to turn away much needed investment opportunities. To put things in their proper perspective, the Member might like to know that in terms of allocations, the economic sector takes up about 20% of our budget whereas the social sector which includes education, health and social services, makes up 40%.&nbsp; This reflects the priority <p align=left>Column: 771<p>of this Government to invest in a capability and well-being of our citizens.&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that the Government, through its choices and its budget, is very much focused on people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Viswa has acknowledged, the GDP is a key economic indicator for any country. GDP measures the income generated by economic activities within a country and for all its shortcomings, it is still one of the best gauges of a country's progress and wealth.&nbsp; A country's GDP per capita tells us a lot about the economic well-being of its people and it tells us a lot more about the economic well-being of its people than any other single measure.&nbsp; Empirical studies have shown GDP to be highly correlated with other indicators of economic and social well-being.&nbsp; Put simply, economic growth is key to improving the lives of people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member mentioned that our focus on GDP growth has led to some social economic dysfunctions.&nbsp; Specifically, he cites two observations&nbsp;&ndash; the large proportion taken up by profits relative to the wage component in the GDP and the significant share of profits by foreign-owned companies. To clarify, this high profit share <I>vis-a-vis</I> wages is not the outcome of deliberate Government policy to favour the corporate sector as against workers.&nbsp; It arises from contributions from a range of companies&nbsp;&ndash; large, medium and small,&nbsp;both foreign and local&nbsp;&ndash; which operate in Singapore.&nbsp; While it is true that a not insignificant share of the profits accrue to foreign companies, this is not a zero-sum game.&nbsp; Some of the profits go toward taxes while some will be retained or reinvested in other projects in Singapore, generating positive multiplier effects in terms of new jobs, technology transfers and management know-how, and adding to a vibrant corporate eco-system anchored in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the Government does not hold down, deliberately or otherwise, wages.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 772<p>Indeed, it is not possible for us to artificially raise or lower the wages of our workers.&nbsp; To do so will distort the market and eventually lead to perverse outcomes. Instead, the sustainable way must be to upskill our workers.&nbsp; This in turn will raise the wages they can command. What is critical is that we continue to monitor wage and income growth of Singaporeans to ensure that our workers benefit from growth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this year's Budget speech, the Minister for Finance had mentioned how median incomes per Singaporean household member had grown by about 20% adjusted for inflation over the last decade,&nbsp;and particularly so from 2005 to 2008.&nbsp; Lower-income households also saw their incomes rise over the past 10 years, albeit to a lesser extent compared to median households. Overall, the total income growth of lower-income households was about 7% in real terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has also made strenuous efforts to re-distribute the wealth generated by GDP growth through asset enhancements and income distribution measures in order to uplift the more vulnerable segments of our society.&nbsp; The Government provides substantial subsidies for housing and education.&nbsp; We have also put in place the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme to supplement the incomes of our low-wage workers to encourage them to stay on their job and improve their skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa mentioned that Singapore has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, as indicated by our Gini coefficient.&nbsp; We are not alone. This is also faced by other global cities, such as Hong Kong and New York, which perhaps are more comparable than the countries cited by the Member, such as the Philippines.&nbsp; Their Gini coefficients are, in fact, more than 5.0, like several other American cities.&nbsp; I would like to point out to Mr Viswa that the Gini coefficient of 4.81 that he cited for 2008 had not <p align=left>Column: 773<p>taken into account income re-distribution via taxes and Government transfers.&nbsp; In 2009, the Gini coefficient net of Government transfers and taxes is, in fact,&nbsp;significantly lower, at 4.53.&nbsp; But even this statistic, as is any other single indicator, is not perfect.&nbsp; It does not capture transfers to families and especially community support through our many-helping-hands approach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, as noted by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech this year, the solution for Singapore cannot be to grow slowly to reduce income inequality.&nbsp; Slow growth will make everyone worse off but it will have the harshest impact on the low-income, the very ones we are trying to help.&nbsp; In other words, the correct approach is not to dumb down the top but to pump up the bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa also cited study findings to illustrate that Singapore has fared badly in indicators of well-being of our citizens and that this is a consequence of a GDP-focused drive for growth. But let me say that other study findings paint quite a different picture.&nbsp; Let me share with the House just one of these alternative findings.&nbsp; The Human Development Index (HDI) published in the United Nations Development Report looks beyond GDP to a broader definition of well-being.&nbsp; It is a composite measure of three dimensions of human development, living a long and healthy life, been educated and having a decent standard of living.&nbsp; Although the Index is not a comprehensive measure of human development, it does indicate the average progress of a country in human development.&nbsp; Between 1980 and 2007, for nearly 30 years, Singapore's HDI rose by 0.68% annually, from 0.785 to 0.944.&nbsp; Singapore ranked in 23rd placing out of&nbsp;182 countries, ahead of Hong Kong (24th place); Malaysia (66th place); and Thailand (87th place).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 774<p>Mr Viswa has called for a framework for a broad-based public policy analysis and the regular reporting of non-economic indicators.&nbsp; The Government understands the need to adopt a Whole-of-Government approach towards developing policies.&nbsp; Civil servants are required and expected to think and formulate policies from the perspective of the public service as a whole rather than from the viewpoint of a specific Ministry or agency.&nbsp; This mindset is critical as many of the challenges that we face can no longer be adequately addressed by a single Ministry or agency because of their complexity and interdependence. This mindset will also ensure that all relevant factors are considered in the process of policy-making.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government already tracks a broad range of socio-economic indicators with Ministries and agencies actively monitoring outcomes and performance in their areas of responsibility. Some of the performance and outcome indicators, such as infant mortality rates, overall satisfaction in public health institutions and indicators for strong and stable families and clean and healthy environment, are published annually in the Budget Book which I think the Member has access to. It is also available in the Ministry of Finance website for public consumption.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we debate the pros and cons of various indicators to reflect our socio-economic conditions, we must not forget that indicators are what they are described to be&nbsp;&ndash; signs and pointers.&nbsp; It is a challenge to develop indicators that accurately or unambiguously capture a particular state of affairs in&nbsp;the socio-economic realm, or the outcomes of a policy at any point in time.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> Order.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, may I have just one minute?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><p align=left>Column: 775<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> One sentence, please.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Hence,&nbsp;it is important that we do not skew behaviour or encourage short-term outlook by over-emphasising the use of indicators.

We received a total of 4,026 applications for this project. Applicants have been informed of their queue position earlier this month, and booking will start in August 2010.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 3,200 or 80% of the applicants are first-timer households, ie, they have never bought a flat with housing subsidies. This is the priority group that the BTO sale exercises seek to cater for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these first-timer households, 53% have not applied for any BTO projects in non-mature estates prior to Boon Lay Grove. Twenty-six percent are second-time BTO applicants, 12% are third-time applicants and the rest (9%) are fourth-or-more time applicants. Among those with previous BTO applications, more than two-thirds (or about 1,100 applicants) have outstanding BTO applications for which the selection exercises have yet to commence[1]. If they are successful in booking a flat in another project, they will have to give up their chances in Boon Lay Grove.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 43% of first-timer households applied under the Fianc&eacute;-Fianc&eacute;e Scheme, ie, they are not married yet. 67% of the first-timer households are aged between 25 and 34 years old. 66% of the households earn $5,000 or less.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application rate does not necessarily represent real demand for housing as it is common for applicants to participate in multiple BTO applications at any one time. A better indicator of demand is whether applicants book or reject a flat when invited to do so. For the two most recent BTO projects where booking exercises have been completed, Montreal Dale (Sembawang) and Segar Grove (Bukit Panjang)[2], the drop-out rates for first-timers were 46% and 33% respectively. The drop-out rates on the first day where applicants had most of the flats to choose from were 38% and 14% respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application rate of Boon Lay Grove is higher than most BTO projects launched in the first half of 2010, reflecting the higher demand for new flats in estates that are relatively more developed. HDB recognises the desire for young couples to live near their parents, and has launched many BTO projects outside Punggol and Sengkang in the last year, covering a good spread of towns/estates such as Jurong West, Dawson, Hougang, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Yishun, Sembawang and Woodlands. However, it is not possible for HDB to meet the demand fully with new flats as there is limited land in these <p align=left>Column: 779<p>estates. HDB would also like to build up the critical mass in new estates in Punggol and Sengkang so that new amenities and facilities can be supported by the resident population as quickly as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is committed to helping Singaporeans own their first homes. Therefore, 95% of new flats are set aside for first-timers. For BTO projects, first-timer applicants receive two chances in the ballot as compared to one chance for second-timers, and four chances if they are applying to live near or with their parents. To help first-timers who are unsuccessful after two or more tries, additional chances are given to them from their third try onwards for a BTO flat in non-mature estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, majority of first-timer applicants were invited to select a BTO flat in non-mature estate within two tries, for projects launched between January and December 2009. Very few first-timers have been unsuccessful after four applications for a BTO flat in non-mature estates. For the most recent BTO projects where booking exercises have been completed (ie, Montreal Dale and Segar Grove launched in December 2009), there were 22 cases whereby first-timer applicants were not invited to select a flat in a non-mature estate after at least four attempts. HDB will offer them help if they have immediate housing need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the demand for new flats, HDB has launched close to 9,000 BTO flats in the first half of 2010, and is prepared to launch an additional 7,200 BTO flats by the end of the year. This year's total BTO flat supply of 16,000 units is almost twice of last year's. The BTO supply will be supplemented by flats under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS), as well as Executive Condominiums (EC) for the higher income buyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reassure Members that HDB is fully committed to ensuring that those who are genuinely looking for a home will be able to do so.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>[<font size=\"2\">1] BTO projects in January to April 2010</font></p><p><font size=\"2\">[2] Launched in December 2009.</font></p><BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 779<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:COMPULSORY EXTRA LESSONS DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:COMPULSORY EXTRA LESSONS DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS:::782--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>COMPULSORY EXTRA LESSONS DURING SCHOOL HOLIDAYS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for Education (a) how many schools conduct compulsory extra lessons for their students during the March or June school holidays; (b) how many students are involved for each school that conducts compulsory extra lessons; and (c) what is the rationale for having compulsory extra lessons during school holidays.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All schools appreciate the school holidays as a break from formal curriculum.

Ms Ng's question addresses three key issues: first, the development of the Singapore Arts Festival into its present state; second, the cultivation of Singaporeans' <p align=left>Column: 783<p>sense of ownership of the Festival; and third, the content and collaborations featured in the Festival.&nbsp; I will address these points in turn.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Arts Festival has come a long way since its beginnings over 30 years ago as a national showcase that celebrates the local arts of our diverse communities.&nbsp; Over time, it has explored the invitation of international stalwarts, the commissioning of new local works, the inclusion of crowd-pleasers, as well as the revisit of seminal works by Singaporean writers.&nbsp; These have shaped the Festival's direction, form and programming mix.&nbsp; Today, the Festival is a celebration of the arts with a distinctive Asian flavour, featuring bold and innovative collaborations.&nbsp; It is still evolving.&nbsp; Yet, at its heart, it remains a People's Festival&nbsp;&ndash; a festival that is committed to the interests and aspirations of our people and resonant among artists and audiences alike.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting this, this year's Festival was themed \"Between You and Me\", and focused on fostering connections with artists and audiences, in order to nurture their sense of ownership of the Festival.&nbsp; To connect with artists, the Festival launched targeted platforms that facilitated deeper dialogue, collaboration and engagement on issues such as tradition and its continued relevance.&nbsp; To connect with audiences, the Festival introduced a year-long education and outreach programme to sustain its engagement with the public beyond the festival period, and to build communities of art lovers, art makers and art volunteers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Festival also seeks to foster a sense of ownership through its unique blend of home-grown works and international brand names, so that Singaporeans can be proud of the Festival's international standing, and yet embrace it as their own.&nbsp; In addition, Singaporeans are invested in the Festival through active participation in Festival showcases and outreach activities.&nbsp; Notably, in the vein of embracing the creative spirit and promoting \"Arts for All\", the Festival culminated in a Mega Line Dance closing event, which brought together 2,100 line dancers from all ages, backgrounds and walks of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audience and critics alike appreciate the Festival's increasing focus on quality local productions and accessible, interactive events.&nbsp; Over the years, the Festival has also garnered higher sponsorships than its predecessor.&nbsp; In spite of uncertainty following the economic downturn, sponsors and donors generously contributed over $1.7 million to this year's Festival.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of content and collaborations, the Festival strives to achieve a programming mix that appeals to a wide range of ages, cultures and artistic taste in order to engage all segments of the population.&nbsp; While international heavyweights such as Joshua Bell, Peter Brook and the Cloud Gate Theatre make their presence felt, regional and local productions are also rapidly making their mark in the Festival, with about half of the nine sold-out productions featuring artists from Southeast Asia.&nbsp; The wide appeal of Festival programmes is evident from the impressive 54% of sold out performances this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Festival also raised awareness of Singapore's performance heritage and history, prompting new audiences and long-time fans to look back at eminent Singaporean productions with fresh perspectives.&nbsp; Margaret Chan's rendition of \"Emily of Emerald Hill\" sold out quickly, and garnered excellent reviews from both the media and audiences.&nbsp; Another seminal production, \"Those Who Can't, Teach\", by The Necessary Stage, also received a similar positive reception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 785<p> Collaborations are essential to achieving a programming mix that is both cutting-edge and resonant among Singaporeans.&nbsp; Collaborations with international partners provide a platform for creative dialogue between local and foreign artists, which seek to share experiences and spark inspirations for local productions with international appeal. To give an example, this year's collaboration with the French Compagnie Carabosse for the opening event exposed the Singaporean volunteers and artists involved to new techniques and possibilities for public arts performances and installations.&nbsp; Collaborations with local audiences, by involving them in the incubation process, will also ensure the relevance of local productions to the Festival and its audiences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, the Singapore Arts Festival will continue to strive to become the quintessential \"People and Creation Festival\".&nbsp; The 2011 Festival is themed \"I want to remember\", and will build on the many successful initiatives piloted this year.&nbsp; As the People's Festival, the Arts Festival will continue to familiarise audiences with Festival productions, art forms and the creative process through the yearlong calendar of&nbsp; education and outreach events leading up to the 2011 Festival.&nbsp; As a Creation Festival, next year's Festival will see new incubated works by Singapore's finest artists and arts companies come to fruition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would like to assure Ms Irene Ng that we will carefully consider all feedback, consult with audiences, and continually review the format and programming of the Festival, to make it relevant to Singaporeans, for Singaporeans.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 785<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:THIRTY PERCENT INCOME RISE FOR AVERAGE SINGAPOREANS OVER NEXT 10 YEARS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:THIRTY PERCENT INCOME RISE FOR AVERAGE SINGAPOREANS OVER NEXT 10 YEARS:::788--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>THIRTY PERCENT INCOME RISE FOR AVERAGE SINGAPOREANS OVER NEXT 10 YEARS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will elaborate on his recent statement of a Singapore being an economy with top quality skills that will raise incomes for average Singaporeans by 30% in the next 10 years, from a median wage of $2,400 to $3,100.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent statement that Singapore should work towards an increase in the median wage by 30% in real terms over the next 10 years, reflects the goal of growing productivity by about the same quantum over the period.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sustained and broad-based rise in wages can only be achieved if we grow overall productivity.

Together with the liberalisation of the taxi industry in January 2003, this has allowed the market forces to determine the appropriate fare structure according to the demand and supply of the taxi services. Taxi companies are, therefore, free to introduce and make changes to taxi surcharges competitively.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location surcharges are usually implemented at the request of the premise owner or event organiser to address the disparities of the supply and demand of taxi services at the particular location.&nbsp; The location surcharge can only be levied with the agreement of the premise owner or event organiser.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years, location surcharges at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) and Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (MBSIR) were introduced.&nbsp; The CBD surcharge and time-based surcharges such as the peak-hour, booking and midnight surcharges were also adjusted in December 2007. Taxi surcharges, account for less than 20% [3] of total taxi fares today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify that ERP charges are road congestion charges, and are not considered part of taxi surcharges. ERP charges are passed on directly to commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground situation has shown that the demand for taxi services is not uniform throughout the day and across all localities in Singapore, while the supply of taxis remains relatively fixed. The pricing mechanism of surcharges provides an efficient channel to allocate these resources to meet the varying demands for taxi services.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><font size=\"2\">[3] The percentage of taxi surcharges (over the total taxi fares) is derived by taking the total surcharges divide by the gross earnings of the taxi drivers.

Since 1990, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has required all new buildings and existing buildings undergoing major additions and alterations to comply with the Code on barrier-free accessibility in buildings.&nbsp; This Code specifies the minimum standards on barrier-free provision in buildings.&nbsp; It was expanded in 2007 to cover accessibility requirements outside buildings, including public walkways and parks, and to improve the interconnectivity between buildings and amenities such as MRT stations, bus-stops and taxi-stands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCA also promotes and facilitates the upgrading of public sector buildings for barrier-free accessibility.&nbsp; While the responsibility of implementing barrier-free features remains with the respective Government agencies that own or manage the facilities, BCA co-chairs an inter-agency co-ordination committee with HDB to resolve inter-connectivity issues that cut across agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Such data are readily available to the public.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But productivity improvements are essentially driven at the firm level by employers and their workers.&nbsp; The scope for such improvements will also depend on the unique characteristics of the industry they are in. Thus, to help firms understand their own productivity performance and to drive relevant changes at the firm level, more granular indicators are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Food and Beverage (F&amp;B) industry employs a high number of part-time workers. This is part and parcel of the nature of the F&amp;B business. However, including part-time workers into the VA per worker numbers would necessarily bring measured productivity down. A more meaningful measure for the F&amp;B industry would be VA per man-hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the Hospitality industry. Hotels who serve similar consumer segments may choose to compare the efficiency of their processes through indicators like room units cleaned per housekeeper, or number of check-ins/check-outs handled per front desk officer. Besides quantitative measures, there are also qualitative measures such as how pleased customers are with the check-in and check-out experience, attentiveness of service staff, level of customer satisfaction, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the retail sector, there is also a tripartite effort to raise productivity. GEMS-UP, which is the program name for \"Go the Extra Mile for Service\", aims to raise the capabilities of retailers for service excellence, by way of helping retailers re-design their business processes, increasing their use of IT and technology, as well as instituting comprehensive training programs through frameworks such as the Service Excellence Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ). In short, productivity improvement requires a holistic approach towards upgrading and human resources development. Employers and HR managers have a great role to play in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above examples clearly demonstrate that different industries require their own plans for productivity measurements and improvements. It is with this consideration that the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council approached productivity improvement on a sectoral basis. It has set up working groups for the 12 priority sectors ranging from construction to retail, F&amp;B and general manufacturing to develop productivity <p align=left>Column: 797<p>improvement plans for each sector. The working groups will work closely with the business associations and companies to develop sector-specific productivity measurements and indicators, guide companies in gathering data for tracking productivity performance, as well as help to provide relevant productivity benchmarks from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the working groups are also studying the need for sector-specific productivity centres. These centres could become thought-leaders showcasing industry best practices, best-of-class innovations and solutions found locally or internationally, and also undertake industry-level research. In this way, industry players, intermediaries, research bodies and training organisations can all come together in a private-public sector partnership to raise productivity across industry sectors.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 797<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The total number of AEDs is projected to grow to about 2,800 by the end of 2015.&nbsp; Compared to public sector norms, the resignation rate of AEDs is relatively low, at less than 4%.&nbsp; To attract good candidates to join the AES and to retain them, the remuneration package of AEDs is reviewed annually and takes into consideration market salary levels.&nbsp; MOE will also continue to refine our selection process to recruit quality AEDs with the right aptitude and attitude.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2009, MOE launched a competency-based appraisal framework for AEDs.&nbsp; Based on inputs from school leaders, teachers as well as AEDs, the appraisal framework provides clarity on AEDs' job responsibilities, and helps AEDs to better understand their individual strengths and development needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE also conducted a post-implementation review of the AES towards the end of 2009, where the relevant stakeholders were consulted to gather feedback on the Scheme.&nbsp; Based on our findings, the AES is generally well-received.&nbsp; Schools appreciate the additional manpower support provided by AEDs, while AEDs appreciate the opportunity to work with students.&nbsp; As the AES is a relatively new scheme, MOE will continue to look into the needs and well-being of the AEDs to see how MOE can better support them in their work.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 797<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While paternity leave has not been legislated, fathers of young children can tap 12 days of child-related leave provided for in legislation&nbsp;&ndash; six days of paid childcare leave for children up to seven years old and six days of unpaid infant care leave for children up to two years old. Both parents are able to apply for the 12 days of leave each to look after their infant. As such leave is to enable parents to spend time with their children, no medical certificate is required for the child when taking such leave. Some employers also provide paternity leave on a voluntary basis. In addition, fathers may utilise their annual leave or agree on alternative work arrangements with their employers, such as part-time work or no-pay leave, to enable them to look after their children.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened to note that many fathers are increasingly playing a larger role at home. In 2009, there were more than 25,000 claims made to the CPF Board in respect of Government-paid childcare leave taken by fathers, just slightly below the 27,000 claims for mothers. MOM's statistics also shows that about 47% of companies offered paternity leave in 2008, compared to 40% in 2004 and 43% in 2006. I expect this trend to <p align=left>Column: 801<p>increase as more employers become more enlightened. Businesses should also realise that they require new approaches for talent attraction and retention, and this includes helping employees&nbsp;&ndash; both males and females&nbsp;&ndash; to better integrate their career and family aspirations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more fundamental and difficult challenge is the question of gender equality. In our society, women have equal rights to education and employment. We have legislated equal access to childcare and infant care leave for both fathers and mothers. However, both partners in a marriage must work out the optimal arrangements and division of responsibilities for their own families. We all know that men need to do more at home, but we cannot legislate this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has asked for our views on the Swedish approach to supporting families. It is true that the Swedish have very generous benefits for parents and children. However, these perks are not free.&nbsp; Taxpayers ultimately pay for all this. Personal income tax at the local level is about 30% while income above 340,000 Swedish Kronor (around $60,800) attracts an additional state tax of 20%-25%. There is also a Value Added Tax of 25%. I do not believe we can afford to have such high levels of taxation and remain competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we have been putting significant resources to support families through Government-paid leave schemes, Baby Bonus, tax benefits, and subsidies for childcare, education, healthcare and assisted reproduction treatment. The budget for the whole suite of Marriage and Parenthood measures comes up to $1.6 billion annually. But at the end of the day, the Government alone cannot boost birth rates. Having children is a personal decision. Singaporeans must want marriage and parenthood and willingly make the sacrifices for the sake of our children. We also need all sectors of society to make adjustments to enable individuals to integrate work and family life in practical ways.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 801<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:INCREASE IN BEGGAR POPULATION--><!--END_COL_TITLE:INCREASE IN BEGGAR POPULATION:::804--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>INCREASE IN BEGGAR POPULATION</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Laurence Wee Yoke Thong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Laurence Wee Yoke Thong </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) what is the reason for the sudden increase in the beggar population in Singapore; and (b) what steps will the Government take to keep in check or prevent such increases.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people found begging in Singapore fluctuates from year to year.

We have also stepped up our surveillance patrols. These have resulted in the increase in the number of beggars picked up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begging is an offence in Singapore under the Destitute Persons Act.&nbsp; Singaporeans in financial distress do not have to beg.&nbsp; They can approach the Community Development Councils, Family Service Centres or grassroots organisations for help.&nbsp; In addition, there <p align=left>Column: 803<p>are many voluntary welfare organisations, religious and civic organisations that provide assistance to the needy.&nbsp; If individuals are unsure where to seek help, they can call the ComCare call line at 1800-222-0000 to be linked up with these agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merely giving money to beggars will not solve their more fundamental long-term problems. It may make matters worse by deepening the sense of dependency and loss of dignity. In addition, it will encourage more foreign beggars to come into Singapore to beg.&nbsp; Members of the public who come across beggars should inform MCYS promptly so that appropriate action can be taken. The public can also help the needy by channelling donations to registered charities and Family Service Centres where there are trained social workers who provide effective assistance to people who are truly needy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS will also continue with our regular surveillance patrols.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 803<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FUNDING SCHEMES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FUNDING SCHEMES:::806--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY FUNDING SCHEMES</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen </B>asked the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts whether he can provide an update on the outcomes of measures taken by the Media Development Authority to address lapses identified in the Auditor-General's Report for FY 2008/2009 in its management of some programmes and funding schemes, particularly the implementation of more rigorous assessment and evaluation of grants schemes.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Nominated Member for her question and interest in the measures which MDA had undertaken to address the lapses identified in the Auditor-General's FY 2008/2009 Report.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that MDA has implemented the necessary remedial measures to address all the lapses identified by AGO.&nbsp; This includes completing the refund of RTV licence fees and the implementation of an auto-refund system, as well as tightening its administration and processes for broadcast licensing, procurement and contract management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Public Service Broadcast or PSB programmes, MDA has instituted regular, mid-term reviews by its management and channel heads. It has revised its key performance indicators to include viewership ratings, programme ratings, programme reach and content hours.

Abused wives, whether Singaporeans or foreigners, can apply to the Courts for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) to restrain their husbands from using violence against them, or to exclude their husbands from their residence. The Court can also require these husbands to attend counselling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Police will render assistance when it receives a report of suspected spousal violence. For example, Police will advise on available assistance, such as how to apply for a PPO and, if appropriate, refer the abused spouse to a crisis shelter or family service centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Women's Charter and Penal Code have provisions against the prostitution and trafficking of women and girls.&nbsp; These provisions can be invoked against unscrupulous agencies which engage in the prostitution of foreign brides under the guise of matchmaking. In addition, the Penal Code also protects minors under 21 years old from being bought or sold for the purposes of prostitution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has a very strict regime to combat the problem of Trafficking in Persons (TIP). Tough enforcement actions and security checks conducted at the various checkpoints deter and detect the movement of illegal immigrants in and out of Singapore. When suspected cases of trafficking are detected at the checkpoints, ICA refers them to the Police for further investigation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 807<p>On the international front, Police leverages on intelligence sources and proactively engages foreign embassies and other organisations, such as INTERPOL and overseas law enforcement agencies, to develop mechanisms to prevent and identify potential victims of trafficking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This multi-pronged approach safeguards foreign brides against abuse or criminal acts.

The key consideration is whether the Singaporean can support his or her foreign spouse financially. Each application for long-term stay is carefully assessed and evaluated on its own merits.&nbsp; As I had earlier stated in this House in May, over the past five years, the success rate of foreign spouses applying for a long-term visit pass is a high 86%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 807<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FREQUENCY AND CAPACITY OF MRT TRAINS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:FREQUENCY AND CAPACITY OF MRT TRAINS:::810--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FREQUENCY AND CAPACITY OF MRT TRAINS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Calvin Cheng </B>asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport whether there is evidence of overcrowding on SMRT trains and, if so, whether SMRT can be directed to increase the frequency of trains especially during peak hours.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Baey Yam Keng </B>asked the Minister for Transport what is the stipulated number of passengers each MRT cabin can safely transport and what measures are in place to ensure that this capacity is not exceeded.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen significant growth in train ridership in the last few years and share commuters' concern that our trains are getting more crowded today, particularly during the peak hours. For this year, the average daily ridership on the North-South East-West Lines (NSEWL) has gone up by about 9% compared to the same period last year[6].<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the maximum train passenger loading on the most congested stretches of the NSEWL during the morning peak-of-peak has also crept up from about 1,400 per train in 2008 to about 1,450 to 1,500 currently. These loadings levels are within the regulatory limits of 1,600 passengers per train, or the equivalent standing space of about 5pax/sqm, as stipulated under the LTA's Operating Performance Standards (OPS), and are below the safety limit of the trains, which are designed to carry well in excess of 1,900 passengers[7].&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing the issue of train crowding has been one of our top priorities. The LTA has been working with SMRT to implement various measures to enhance capacity and manage crowding. What SMRT has done has been to put all the available trains into service during the peak periods and constantly monitor and adjust the train operating and deployment patterns to meet the constantly-changing loading patterns on its network. This has ensured that our MRT system does not breach the regulatory limits. And wherever possible, SMRT has added more train trips so that loading levels can be brought down further, without compromising the need for safety and maintenance. In total, SMRT has <p align=left>Column: 809<p>injected over 1,100 train trips. Other initiatives to manage train crowding include the introduction of in-train and station platform announcements and deployment of service ambassadors to facilitate the boarding and alighting of commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we fully recognise that more needs to be done and a longer-term approach is needed to improve the overall system capacity significantly.&nbsp; We have already put in place various initiatives which will start coming on-stream next year.&nbsp; Firstly, the LTA has embarked on the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP) to relieve the existing infrastructural constraints that limit our ability to run more frequent train trips during the peak periods.&nbsp; Together with the purchase of 22 additional trains, this will mean an enhancement in the capacity of NSEWL by about 15% when the project is completed in 2011. With this, trains can run more frequently during the peak periods and commuters can look forward to a more comfortable train ride and shorter waiting times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the JEMP, the opening of the remaining Circle Line in 2011 will also help to relieve crowding levels on existing lines. Beyond these, work on the Downtown Line has begun, and the Government is also making significant investments to improve the density of the MRT network to cater to future travel demand.&nbsp; Where necessary, even more trains for the NSEWL as well as for the North East Line (NEL) would be purchased to cater to the anticipated ridership increase.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure the House that we are fully committed to ensuring that our MRT network, which is the backbone of our public transport system, would have the capacity to meet the needs of the commuting public.&nbsp; We will do what we can to ensure that the train crowding situation is dealt with appropriately and expeditiously.&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><font size=\"2\">[6] Average January - May ridership for 2009 and 2010 were 1,393,013 and 1,518,624 respectively.<br>[7] The maximum safety loads of a six-car train and three-car train are 1,920 and 931 passengers respectively.<br></font><BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 809<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ABSCONDMENT OF FOREIGNERS CHARGED WITH CHEATING CASINO--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ABSCONDMENT OF FOREIGNERS CHARGED WITH CHEATING CASINO:::812--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>ABSCONDMENT OF FOREIGNERS CHARGED WITH CHEATING CASINO</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Sylvia Lim </B>asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) how three foreigners charged in court in April 2010 with cheating the Resorts World Casino managed to abscond while their cases were pending; and (b) whether these incidents indicate a need to tighten up pre-trial procedures or border controls.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year, three foreigners were arrested for cheating at the casinos.

Police have liaised with their counterparts overseas and investigations on the whereabouts of the accused persons are still ongoing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 811<p>Without prejudicing the outcome of the investigations, let me address the issue as to whether there is a need to tighten up pre-trial procedures or border controls as a result of this incident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), the offence of cheating with common intention is one which is bailable as of right and bail has to be offered to the accused person. The Court may impose conditions for the accused person's release on bail, including specifying the number of sureties, setting the bail amount and requiring the impounding of passports. As investigations had concluded, the continued remand of these three accused persons in Police custody was not necessary. As they were able to meet the requirements for bail and their passports were impounded by the authorities, the accused persons were released.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the argument is for the Courts not to grant bail in all cases of cheating by foreigners, I think the bail process is balanced and fair, balancing the rights of the accused, victim and the public interest in a particular case. Indeed, as Ms Lim knows, improvements were made to the bail process as recently as 2007 with the setting up of a dedicated Bail Court. Moreover, the current Chief District Judge has further streamlined the process to make it faster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are established procedures for Home Team agencies like ICA and Police to detect wanted persons at the checkpoints. Police are still investigating how the three accused persons absconded even though their passports were impounded. It is therefore premature at this point in time to speculate as to how they left the country.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 811<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:USAGE OF SEGWAY GREEN VEHICLES ON SINGAPORE ROADS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:USAGE OF SEGWAY GREEN VEHICLES ON SINGAPORE ROADS:::812--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>USAGE OF SEGWAY GREEN VEHICLES ON SINGAPORE ROADS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mrs Mildred Tan--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mrs Mildred Tan </B>asked the Minister for Transport given the use of Segways on roads in Europe, whether the Ministry will consider allowing such green vehicles to be used outside Sentosa and private roads.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of the Segway Personal Transporters (SPTs) in different jurisdictions differs.

There are various factors that influence the inflow of foreigners in Singapore, including economic factors such as the business or employment opportunities of the individual, the calibre of foreigners we need to or are able to attract for our economy and for population augmentation, the productivity of Singaporeans, and social factors such as the pace at which foreigners can be accommodated without introducing undue stress to our society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners have an important role to play in the success of our economy. As of today, foreign workers make up almost one-third of our total workforce. They fill many jobs including those which Singaporeans do not want to do, eg, those in the construction, marine and manufacturing industries. They also fill jobs because we do not have enough Singaporeans to fill, eg, those in the services sector, like financial and tourism industries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Government recognises that we cannot let the proportion of foreign workers in the workforce increase indefinitely, as there are real physical and social limits. Furthermore, companies that continue to rely heavily on foreign workers will have little incentive to invest in productivity improvements. The Economic Strategies Committee has thus proposed that foreigners be capped at the current one-third of total workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this will not be implemented through setting quotas or specifying an optimal number of foreign workers. Instead, the Government will manage foreign workers sectorally and through a phased increase in the foreign worker levy. This allows companies the flexibility to employ the foreign workers they need to seize business opportunities and grow, without being hamstrung by rigid quotas. At the same time, the Government will help companies reduce their reliance on low-skilled foreign workers through productivity enhancing initiatives, such as the establishment of a $2 billion National Productivity Fund and the introduction of the Productivity and Innovation Credit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we moderate the growth of the total foreign workforce, it remains critical for Singapore to attract highly capable and entrepreneurial people from around the world to work here. They will complement our home-grown talent in areas like science and engineering, design, finance and start-ups. Keeping our society open to top talent will help to create many more opportunities for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than this transient pool of foreign workers needed to supplement our workforce, immigrants are also needed to supplement our population. The reason is our declining birth rates, which are well below the replacement rate and a rapidly aging population. To make <p align=left>Column: 815<p>up for the shortfall, we need to take about 20,000 new citizens a year, to keep our citizen core.&nbsp; We will continue to be stringent in our requirements and grant citizenship to those of suitable quality, and who not only contribute to Singapore economically but also integrate well into our society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we continue to attract talented individuals to Singapore, we need to ensure that they are well-integrated into the local community. The National Integration Council was set up to spearhead efforts to integrate PRs and new citizens into our society. A number of measures to promote and foster social cohesion among locals, new immigrants and foreigners have been implemented. For instance, the Singapore Citizenship Journey was recently introduced to help new citizens learn more about Singapore's history and our way of life. For the transient foreigners, there are also programmes to help them adapt to local culture and conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attracting the right kind of people to Singapore and ensuring that they are welcomed into our society cannot be achieved by the Government alone. We need to and will continue to work with the community to explore new measures to enhance the integration of new immigrants.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 815<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CHARGES FOR STATE LAND MARKED FOR REDEVELOPMENT--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CHARGES FOR STATE LAND MARKED FOR REDEVELOPMENT:::816--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CHARGES FOR STATE LAND MARKED FOR REDEVELOPMENT</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

We believe that the current 70% DC rate is reasonable in the current market conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key to moderating costs to the industry is to enhance construction productivity, and not by reducing the DC and shifting the costs of infrastructure and services to support land intensification somewhere else.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 817<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADDITIONAL AREAS FOR ASSESSMENT IN TOWN COUNCIL REPORT--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADDITIONAL AREAS FOR ASSESSMENT IN TOWN COUNCIL REPORT:::818--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>ADDITIONAL AREAS FOR ASSESSMENT IN TOWN COUNCIL REPORT</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for National Development whether the recent Town Council Management Report is exhaustive and should the areas of assessment include more areas of concern besides arrears, sinking funds and cleanliness.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aims of the Town Council Management Report (TCMR) are to:<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide residents with basic information about the key areas of estate&nbsp;management; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilitate discussions between Town Councils (TCs) and residents about how they can jointly achieve the desired level of upkeep of their estates over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep it simple, the first report did not attempt to be comprehensive at the first instance but focused on the \"bread and butter\" functions that are applicable to all TCs.

This is understandable as residents' personal experiences may not always be congruent with the TCMR scores, which are averages of sample blocks.

Other possible indicators include the management of potential killer litter and adequacy of sinking funds.

Those with more serious addiction problems are treated by the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) which offers clinical and counselling services.&nbsp; Both Tanjong Pagar and NAMS also engage with families, where the problem gambler refuses to come forward. This is because the family members also need counselling and support. The number of clients seen by Tanjong Pagar was 128 cases in 2008 and 134 cases in 2009. Up to June this year, 113 cases were seen, of which 44 were new clients.&nbsp; As for NAMS, the number of cases seen was 176 cases in 2008 and 290 cases in 2009.&nbsp; From January to June 2010, number of cases seen was 243, of which 130 were new clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since family exclusion orders were made available in April 2009, NCPG has received 148 such applications and issued 123 orders.

Prof. Fatimah Lateef's view that it is important that adequate provisions are made for the training of taxi drivers and to ensure that they drive safely on our roads. The Land Transport Authority has these in place. For a start, an applicant for a Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) must have held a Class 3 driving licence for a continuous period of one year immediately prior to the application for the TDVL. Applicants then undergo a training course and a test covering the various aspects of holding a vocational licence, including conduct required of a taxi driver, relevant rules and regulations, key routes and landmarks, and the names and location of key buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after obtaining their vocational licences, TDVL holders must continue to maintain acceptable driving and disciplinary records, failing which their TDVL may be suspended or revoked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent economic downturn did not see any significant increase in the number of TDVLs issued.&nbsp; The number of new TDVLs in the past one year (May 2009 to April 2010) was 4,200, compared to 3,600 in the preceding year (May 2008 to April 2009) and 4,800 two years ago (May 2007 to April 2008).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 825<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR FOREIGN WORKERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR FOREIGN WORKERS:::828--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

MOM's targeted enforcement approach against areas with clusters of illegal FW housing has also resulted in the reduction of FWs being housed illegally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign workers were educated on Singapore laws and social norms through guidebooks, training courses and regular road shows, to minimise potential social <p align=left>Column: 827<p>disamenities.
