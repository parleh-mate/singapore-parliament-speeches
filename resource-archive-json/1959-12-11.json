This  is\r\n\r\nbecause of an addition of the sum of $42,860  which\r\n\r\nappears  as item (1) of subhead 1 at page  35.

Am I to understand that it\r\n\r\nis  this meeting that has been called upon  to  fix\r\n\r\nthe  personal  emoluments of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara? I should have thought that this would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  done  very much earlier rather than  left  to\r\n\r\nthis last moment. Perhaps another point on which an\r\n\r\nexplanation  might be given, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthe  increase of $10 on the previous 1959 estimates\r\n\r\nin  the  total  sum payable to the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.  The  third point on which  an  explanation\r\n\r\nmight  be  given  is whether on  the  total  amount\r\n\r\npayable  to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, income  tax\r\n\r\nwould be paid?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I would\r\n\r\nhave preferred, Mr Speaker, Sir, to have been able\r\n\r\nto  determine the emoluments of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  before  today. Members are aware  that  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara took office on the  3rd  of\r\n\r\nDecember.  We  were all pre-occupied  with  Loyalty\r\n\r\nWeek  and there was this other consideration,  that\r\n\r\nthe  emolument to be fixed was dependent  upon  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  he  shall  live  after  he   was\r\n\r\ninstalled in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has, from the evening of the 2nd of December,\r\n\r\nmoved  into  the  domain which we now  call  Istana\r\n\r\nNegara,  but he has expressed to me his desire  not\r\n\r\nto  reside in the Istana itself. He has informed me\r\n\r\nthat he would prefer his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  capacity to be distinct from his  official\r\n\r\ncapacity.  He  has therefore chosen to  live  in  a\r\n\r\nbungalow  inside  the  domain  which  used  to   be\r\n\r\noccupied by the former Under-Secretaries. He  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  discharge the functions  of  his  office - both the ceremonial and the official functions - from\r\n\r\nGovernment  House.  Istana  Negara  will   be   his\r\n\r\nofficial place for State business. This has  to  be\r\n\r\nborne  in mind when we decide on the emoluments  to\r\n\r\nbe  given  him,  because whilst  Istana  Negara  is\r\n\r\nmaintained  completely  out  of  State  funds,  his\r\n\r\nfamily  and  household commitments in the  bungalow\r\n\r\ninside  the  domain  will be on  his  own  personal\r\n\r\naccount.  Bearing in mind that the former  Governor\r\n\r\nreceived  \u00a35,000 as his salary, and \u00a31,500  as  his\r\n\r\nduty allowance, we decided that the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara shall receive the sum shown as the estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure in 1960, namely $42,860. Another reason\r\n\r\nis  this:  that the order of precedence, which  has\r\n\r\nnow been settled by the Negara in consultation with\r\n\r\nHer Majesty the Queen, establishes the \"Negara\"  as\r\n\r\nfirst  in  the order of precedence; myself  as  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister second; third the Chief Justice; and\r\n\r\nfourth the Speaker. As you know, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nyour   emoluments  have  been  determined  by   the\r\n\r\nConstitution until June 1960, and I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthat  this  House will have equally charitable  and\r\n\r\ngenerous  considerations in  mind  when  June  1960\r\n\r\ncomes.  I  am in receipt of $50 more than you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, and although we originally  intended\r\n\r\nto  fix  the  Negara's emoluments at $3,500,  which\r\n\r\nwill  make it slightly less than \u00a35,000 we  decided\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no real reason why  our  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, in view of the fact that he  would\r\n\r\nhave to maintain his own family and his own private\r\n\r\nbungalow, should get less than \u00a35,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point. There is really no mystery\r\n\r\nabout the increase of $10. If the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark will look at the item, he will find, under the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, Governor - $42,850, and then\r\n\r\nthe   Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara/   United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nCommissioner   $10.  The  Treasury   procedure   of\r\n\r\nbudgeting  requires a token $10. It was,  in  fact,\r\n\r\n$42,860, because the United Kingdom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissioner  was  at the same time  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. The United Kingdom Government  has,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  coming  into force of the  Constitution,\r\n\r\npaid  half  the  emoluments,  duty  allowance   and\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowance  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara. Therefore, the Treasury brought $60 down to\r\n\r\n$50, put $10 token against the other item - Yang  di-Pertuan Negara/United Kingdom Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question of income tax. We have,\r\n\r\nafter  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara indicated  to  us\r\n\r\nthat  he would prefer to live in a private bungalow\r\n\r\ninside  the  domain  instead of the  Istana  Negara\r\n\r\nproper itself, decided that he shall be exempt from\r\n\r\nincome tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is so provided in the law, is it\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there was a\r\n\r\ncertain amount of argument as to whether or not  it\r\n\r\nis  so  provided in the law. The intention of those\r\n\r\nwho  went  to the London Conference is supposed  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  embodied  in the  law.  If  I  remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly, it was our original intention  that  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara, unlike the Governor in  the\r\n\r\npast,  should  not be above the law. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nit  has been so drafted that there may be a measure\r\n\r\nof doubt. In any case, we have now decided, because\r\n\r\nof  the considerations that I have stated, that  he\r\n\r\nwill be exempt from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nput  in this amendment for the purpose of eliciting\r\n\r\ninformation from the Prime Minister.

The   practice   appertaining   to\r\n\r\nappointment   to   the  post  of  President,   Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation  Board,  has always  been  to  appoint\r\n\r\neither a District Judge, or somebody who was not  a\r\n\r\npractising member of the Bar.

Section 8 (3) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The President shall possess the qualifications\r\n\r\nrequired  for a District Judge under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  section 56 of the Courts Ordinance,  and  shall\r\n\r\npreside at all sessions of the Board.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, when the new Government came  in,  we\r\n\r\nmade   a   careful  analysis  of   the   old   Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board and we found that it was  mainly\r\n\r\na  Board  operated in the interest of the  property\r\n\r\nand landlord class. We found that of the 15 members\r\n\r\nof  the  Board, 10 represented The property  class,\r\n\r\nthree represented the Singapore Clerical Union  and\r\n\r\ntwo  represented the T.U.C. So we have taken  steps\r\n\r\nto   rectify  the  position  in  order   that   the\r\n\r\npopulation  of Singapore can be better  represented\r\n\r\non the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, under the Rent Control\r\n\r\nOrdinance, it has been laid down that the President\r\n\r\nshall  possess  the qualifications required  for  a\r\n\r\nDistrict   Judge.  It  does  not  state  that   the\r\n\r\nPresident should be a District Judge. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwe  have checked up with the new President, and  he\r\n\r\npossesses   the  qualifications  required   for   a\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second point which the Member for Farrer Park has raised is that the President\r\n\r\nshould  not be a practising lawyer. It is not  laid\r\n\r\ndown  anywhere in the Ordinance. If it happens that\r\n\r\nthe  past President was a District Judge,  that  is\r\n\r\nbecause one had been appointed. There is nothing in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance to say that the President of the Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation  Board  should  not  be  a  practising\r\n\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As far as I understand the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply,  though he did not specifically say  so,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  present\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the Rent Conciliation Board  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  practising member of the Bar. If that  is\r\n\r\naccepted,  then  I will proceed on  that  basis.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest to the Minister that  it  is  highly\r\n\r\nundesirable for a practising member of the  Bar  to\r\n\r\nbe   appointed  to  such  a  post.  In  his  normal\r\n\r\npractice, he would come into contact with all sorts\r\n\r\nof   people - tenants,  landlords   and   owners   of\r\n\r\nproperty.  I do not say that he will be  influenced\r\n\r\nby  them - but  a  number of people,  who  might  not\r\n\r\notherwise  have gone to him on matters  other  than\r\n\r\nthose  appertaining to the Rent Conciliation Board,\r\n\r\nmight  go  to him and seek his services merely  for\r\n\r\nthe  reason that when their matters come up  before\r\n\r\nhim  for consideration as President, they might get\r\n\r\nan   added   advantage.  Surely,  Sir,   the   Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation  Board  is a court  of  law.  All  its\r\n\r\nproceedings are judicial proceedings. This  is  the\r\n\r\nthin  end of the wedge. Is the Government going  to\r\n\r\nallow  a  practising member of the Bar to become  a\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge? Is the Government going to allow  a\r\n\r\npractising member of the Bar to become a High Court\r\n\r\nJudge? The President of the Rent Conciliation Board\r\n\r\nis  a  judicial officer because the proceedings  of\r\n\r\nthe Rent Conciliation Board by statute are judicial\r\n\r\nproceedings. If I am required to cite  chapter  and\r\n\r\nverse, I am prepared to do so, but by virtue of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  itself  all  proceedings  of  the   Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board are judicial proceedings. If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accept the principle that a  practising\r\n\r\nmember of the Bar could become the President of the\r\n\r\nRent  Conciliation Board, then I think they  should\r\n\r\nalso  accept the principle that a High Court  Judge\r\n\r\ncould practise his profession at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, whilst I do not\r\n\r\nconcede the validity of the argument put forward by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park, I will be the first  to\r\n\r\nadmit  and  to  uphold the principle  that  he  who\r\n\r\nadjudicates  must be above criticism or  suspicion.\r\n\r\nThis appointment, Sir, was made by my colleague the\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development.

It has been the practice elsewhere that  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Legislature should be independent\r\n\r\nof   the  Executive  and  that  the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislature  should hold loyalty to the Legislature\r\n\r\nitself  and  to  each  and  every  Member  of   the\r\n\r\nAssembly, irrespective of his Party affiliations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\nhoary  subject. We have had it on and off  for  the\r\n\r\nlast   four   years.   Just  to   demonstrate   his\r\n\r\nflexibility   and  resilience,  the  former   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  now  comes forward as the protagonist  of\r\n\r\nthe independence of the staff of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that this was one of the\r\n\r\nmatters  which  you strenuously  pressed  when  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  talks were going on  in  London  in\r\n\r\n1956,  again in 1957, and again in 1958. For  three\r\n\r\nyears  running, we have debated this. We have  gone\r\n\r\nover  the arguments forwards and backwards  umpteen\r\n\r\ntimes.  In  theory,  if you  go  according  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple   of  the  separation  of   powers,   the\r\n\r\nLegislature  is  independent of the Executive,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Executive  has no control over the  Judiciary.\r\n\r\nThe  Executive  implements the  laws  made  by  the\r\n\r\nLegislature. The Judiciary interprets them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  the logical conclusion one comes to  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  staff  of  the Legislature must  be  recruited\r\n\r\nseparately and must be a separate establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these arguments having been taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration,  we  decided that the  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor advancement in such a small hierarchy in such a\r\n\r\nsmall  establishment  are  so  limited  that   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  would  find  it  extremely  difficult  to\r\n\r\nattract  suitable recruits. For that  reason,  you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  had  put  forward  the  rather\r\n\r\ningenious suggestion that there should be  an  open\r\n\r\nservice in the lower levels but that it should be a\r\n\r\nclosed  service in the higher levels. We  have  all\r\n\r\nseen  the  succession of Clerks  of  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nsince  1950. In 1950, my friend and colleague,  now\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law, officiated in that\r\n\r\ncapacity. And so it has been going on. The turnover\r\n\r\nhas  been fairly rapid. But we all hope that it has\r\n\r\nbeen  stabilised  by the present incumbent  who,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  is  sufficiently  strong  and  healthy,  and\r\n\r\ndedicated to the intricate and complicated  art  of\r\n\r\nStanding Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, Sir, when you pressed this\r\n\r\nmatter again on our assumption of office, we stated\r\n\r\nthat  we would rather allow a reasonable period  of\r\n\r\ntime  to elapse before we review the decision which\r\n\r\nwe  took  after being pressed on this  issue  three\r\n\r\nyears running. There were cogent reasons why we did\r\n\r\nnot accept your views then and why the former Chief\r\n\r\nMinister also did not accept your views when he was\r\n\r\nin  a position to determine these matters.

But  in  my\r\n\r\nOffice there is protocol, which includes Government\r\n\r\nhospitality.  The  four  chauffeurs   shown   there\r\n\r\ncomprise  three  whom we have  inherited  from  the\r\n\r\nformer  Chief Secretary; and we have one  more  car\r\n\r\nwhich was used by the former President of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.

We have therefore to recruit\r\n\r\none more chauffeur to look after the other car.

However, I can assure him that I will\r\n\r\nimmediately cause another copy to be sent  to  him,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps he might wish to avail himself of  the\r\n\r\nopportunities    for   equipping    himself    more\r\n\r\nefficiently in the languages used in this Assembly.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, that he would do\r\n\r\nwell  to  follow in your footsteps and  master  the\r\n\r\nintricacies of Bahasa Kebangsaan. May I say that  I\r\n\r\napologise for the late delivery of the circular  to\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr  Speaker. My Secretary believed that  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker, being omniscient, need no further training\r\n\r\nin  any  matters. Therefore, I had to disabuse  his\r\n\r\nmind after you had indicated to me that you are not\r\n\r\nso omniscient. I am glad, Sir, that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  has looked after your need to equip  you\r\n\r\nwith an understanding of what is being said in this\r\n\r\nHouse before it is being translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I beg leave to withdraw that\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 7 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of sub-head 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, sub-head II deals with the question of upkeep of vehicles - $9,300.

The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's cost of upkeep\r\n\r\nof  motor cars is $8,000. The Prime Minister's cost\r\n\r\nof  upkeep of one vehicle less costs $9,300.  Could\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister please explain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is rather a sad\r\n\r\nexplanation, and I hope the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwill  extend  us  his sympathy. At some  convenient\r\n\r\ndate in the future, we shall put in a supplementary\r\n\r\nvote to ensure that the maintenance shall not be so\r\n\r\nhigh because the vehicles are so old. Sir, the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara inherited wellkept and relatively\r\n\r\nnew  vehicles  with which the former Governors  and\r\n\r\nCommanders-in-Chief equipped themselves. He  has  a\r\n\r\nRolls Royce in excellent condition. He has a Humber\r\n\r\nPullman, also in excellent condition. Unfortunately\r\n\r\nour vehicles have seen more service, and because of\r\n\r\nthis, they require a great deal more attention  and\r\n\r\nreplacement,  from time to time,  of  vital  moving\r\n\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Humber Pullman formerly used by the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  a 1952 model. The one  used  by  the\r\n\r\nformer  President  of the City Council  is  a  1949\r\n\r\nmodel. The Snipe is a 1955 model and the Hawk is  a\r\n\r\n1955 model. They have gone over 70,000 miles. I was\r\n\r\ntold  that after 70,000 miles, all moving parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  engine  must  be changed  and  that  has  been\r\n\r\nattended   to.  But  I  regret  to  say  that   our\r\n\r\nmechanical  engineers are unable to  restore  these\r\n\r\ncars,  the average life of which is over six years,\r\n\r\nto  the condition in which they were or ought to be\r\n\r\nwhen  they  were  new.  Hence the  relatively  high\r\n\r\nrepair charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason is that the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara does not run as big a hospitality roster  as\r\n\r\nwe  do. Take this morning, for instance. It is  not\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  inform Members of the  Opposition  how\r\n\r\nimportant these little courtesies are. Not only did\r\n\r\nwe   extend   transport  facilities   to   visiting\r\n\r\ndignitaries  from the Federation at this  morning's\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council meeting,  but  there  is\r\n\r\nalso  his  staff. Therefore, frequent use of  these\r\n\r\ncars  are  made  by  visiting Ministers  and  other\r\n\r\nimportant  officials who from  time  to  time  pass\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore.  More  of  the  hospitality  is\r\n\r\nlooked  after by the protocol section of my  office\r\n\r\nthan that of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I hope I will receive the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Members of the Opposition when  the\r\n\r\ntime comes to scrap\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  cars after they have done more than  100,000\r\n\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Perhaps, Mr Speaker, the final\r\n\r\nexplanation  as to why the cost in  his  sector  is\r\n\r\nheavier  than that of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nsector  may be that his chauffeurs are not as  well\r\n\r\npaid  as  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's chauffeurs.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in view of the explanation given  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $471,500 for Head 7 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 8 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (40) of sub-head 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, item 40, Airport General\r\n\r\nManager  [$1,300 - 40A - 1,420].

It\r\n\r\nwas built by the past Colonial government, of which\r\n\r\nthe   Member   for  Farrer  Park   had   got   much\r\n\r\nconnections,  for the expatriates to go  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  sublime and cool climate up in Fraser's  Hill.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the City Council has also built\r\n\r\nbungalows at Fraser's Hill, and perhaps the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park during the good old days  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council had also enjoyed the perfect  climate\r\n\r\nin  the City Council bungalow which is not far from\r\n\r\nRichmond  Bungalow up in Fraser's Hill.

I  assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  the  Treasury keeps a strict watch  on  these\r\n\r\nmatters,   and  that  no  extravagance   is   being\r\n\r\nincurred.  In fact, the one being used is  the  one\r\n\r\nthat  was formerly allotted as Government quarters,\r\n\r\nand the Government is getting its full share of the\r\n\r\nrevenue by way of rent from these quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a proposal initiated by I do not know\r\n\r\nwho,  that  the  hostel  should  be  provided  with\r\n\r\ncrockery,  cooks  and other comforts  of  life.

There  is  plenty   of   transport\r\n\r\navailable  at  that hour to send  Members  back  to\r\n\r\ntheir homes in time. I have still not been given  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  answer,  despite  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance's attempt to do it. He said that a circular\r\n\r\nfound its way to him but, strangely enough, it  did\r\n\r\nnot  find  its  way to the Opposition benches.  So,\r\n\r\neither  somebody forgot the Opposition benchers  as\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,   or   the\r\n\r\ncircular went astray in the post. I should hesitate\r\n\r\nto  think  that  it could have gone astray  in  the\r\n\r\npost,  and, therefore, possibly the only reasonable\r\n\r\nconclusion I could come to is that nobody  bothered\r\n\r\nto send it to us. However, the Finance Minister has\r\n\r\nassured the House that no food is being provided to\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Assemblymen  on  public  account,  and   no\r\n\r\nbedding is being provided to P.A.P. Assemblymen  on\r\n\r\npublic  account. In fact, nothing is being provided\r\n\r\nfor them on public account. That they are paying an\r\n\r\neconomic rental, as all Government servants,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold, pay an economic rental; and, therefore, since\r\n\r\nthe  Government's scale of rents is being  paid  on\r\n\r\nit,  it  is  quite  a business proposition.

There are only 10 beds in three\r\n\r\nrooms  and  the  rate  was  $2  per  day  for  each\r\n\r\nAssemblyman. Some Assemblymen have moved  into  the\r\n\r\nhostel  and  they  are paying a rent  of  $120  per\r\n\r\nmonth, plus charges for electricity, water and gas.\r\n\r\nAll    these   charges   are   collected   by   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  from\r\n\r\nthe resident members and paid into the Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Government expenditure on this\r\n\r\nhostel,  it  is  very  small.

I  think,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that basic fear and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  lack of confidence in our own people have been\r\n\r\nthe  greatest factors which had prompted the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Cairnhill  to  lay  a:  barrage  against  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development, a barrage  taken\r\n\r\nup  later  by  the Member for Mountbatten  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer Park. That  is  why,  when  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill was running the government, he\r\n\r\nspent  tens  of millions of dollars in paying  off\r\n\r\nthe  expatriates; and that is why, when the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park was running the City Council,  he\r\n\r\nashamedly  put  up  a bill in  order  to  give  $14\r\n\r\nmillion to about 120 expatriates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the People's Action Party is made of a different calibre. When the expatriate engineers\r\n\r\ncame to see me during the time when we were in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and threatened to resign as early  as\r\n\r\nJanuary 1958, I accepted the challenge. I told them\r\n\r\nthat  if  they wanted to resign and play  politics,\r\n\r\nthey  were at liberty to do so and I would  welcome\r\n\r\nany  challenge. Mr Speaker, our work in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil had been thrown open for a decision by  the\r\n\r\npeople. It was justified in the Kallang by-election\r\n\r\nand in the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have confidence that our local engineers,\r\n\r\narchitects and administrators can run this country.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure the Member for Farrer Park is not  well\r\n\r\naware  that at present in Singapore there are  many\r\n\r\nlocal engineers and architects who cannot get  jobs\r\n\r\nat  all. The first step I took in the first week of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Government  was to sack  five  expatriate\r\n\r\narchitects  in the P.W.D., who had been engaged  by\r\n\r\nthe  old  Government despite the  protests  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal  architects, both in the P.W.D. and  outside.\r\n\r\nNot   only  did  the  old  government  engage  five\r\n\r\nexpatriate  architects on a  contract  basis,  they\r\n\r\neven  gave  work  to  outside expatriate  firms  of\r\n\r\narchitects. Mr Speaker, the expatriate  architects\r\n\r\nin   the  P.W.D. in  those  days  and  the   local\r\n\r\narchitects in the City Council in those days had  a\r\n\r\ncompetition   in   the   Constitution    Exposition\r\n\r\nexhibition in which the Lim Yew Hock Government was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  vie  with  the  P.A.P.-dominated   City\r\n\r\nCouncil  as  to who was capable of putting  up  the\r\n\r\nbest  show. Mr Speaker, despite the fact that they\r\n\r\nput up $600,000 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  only  spent $100,000, the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nknew who put up the best show and who put it up  on\r\n\r\nthe target date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said just now, there\r\n\r\nare many engineers and architects who have returned\r\n\r\nfrom   universities  in  Australia,   America   and\r\n\r\nEngland,  and who have found themselves  unable  to\r\n\r\nget  jobs  at  present. There  is  no  shortage  of\r\n\r\nskilled personnel in this country. For instance, in\r\n\r\nthe  construction of houses, we took action to sack\r\n\r\nall the expatriate architects in the S.I.T. - six of\r\n\r\nthem - and   we   replaced  them   with   six   local\r\n\r\narchitects. In the same way, we took action to sack\r\n\r\nthe five expatriate architects on contract basis in\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. and at present, because of  the  stand\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the old Government, we are not  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  positive  steps  to  recruit  the  unemployed\r\n\r\narchitects  and  engineers hovering  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the position in the P.W.D. is  very  well\r\n\r\nunder   control,  and  the  first   step   in   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of this most corrupt department will\r\n\r\nsoon  start.  The Director of Public Works  was  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate. He went last month, and a local man has\r\n\r\nnow  taken  his place, officiating as  Director  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Works. The Deputy Director of Public  Works\r\n\r\nwas  also  an expatriate. He also left last  month.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I can assure you that when all  these\r\n\r\nexpatriates leave, I will never give the  slightest\r\n\r\nindication that we need their services any more. We\r\n\r\nwelcome them to leave if they are not interested in\r\n\r\nserving the people of this country. We have a local\r\n\r\nman  at present to officiate as Deputy Director  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Works.  Mr  Speaker,  this  local  man  is\r\n\r\nresponsible at present for expediting the  drainage\r\n\r\nscheme which the previous expatriates in the P.W.D.\r\n\r\ntook  many  years to carry out. The Chief  Engineer\r\n\r\nwas also an expatriate and has also left. The Chief\r\n\r\nArchitect  was also an expatriate and he  has  also\r\n\r\nleft.  Mr Speaker, we do not attempt to make these\r\n\r\npeople  stay  because  we feel  that,  in  national\r\n\r\nconstruction  work, only persons who are  dedicated\r\n\r\nto  the  service of this country can work  properly\r\n\r\nand  efficiently, and the S.I.T.,  which  has  been\r\n\r\nthoroughly reorganised, is clear proof of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat we are doing.

In the case of one school  a\r\n\r\nquarter of a million dollars has been paid  to  the\r\n\r\ncontractors,  but not one dollar of  capital  grant\r\n\r\nhas  been paid because the P.W.D. has not been able\r\n\r\nto  inspect  the job and give it approval.

My appreciation of\r\n\r\nthe  vote  is  that  the total provision  made  for\r\n\r\npurchase of stores by Government is $1,500,000, and\r\n\r\nit  is  a  central purchase which will be allocated\r\n\r\nthroughout  the  different  departments  for  which\r\n\r\napparently the different departments are  going  to\r\n\r\npay  the central store $1,433,000. I also know that\r\n\r\nit  is  the  practice of Government that when  they\r\n\r\nmake  these central purchases, they put a five  per\r\n\r\ncent  charge on it, so that they make a profit - they\r\n\r\ncall it a cost charge - which will help to defray the\r\n\r\ncost of centralised storing before they sell it  to\r\n\r\nthe  other sub-heads.

The P.W.D. works\r\n\r\nas  an  agency on behalf of Government departments,\r\n\r\nand  buys stores on their behalf. Stores come  into\r\n\r\nthe P.W.D. and they are charged to other Government\r\n\r\ndepartments' votes.

The\r\n\r\nMinister's  explanation is that, in one  particular\r\n\r\nyear  there  may be a debit of $67.000 towards  the\r\n\r\nend  of  that year.

The\r\n\r\nimplication in that statement is some of the  bills\r\n\r\ncannot be recoverable during the year and can  only\r\n\r\nbe recovered in the following year. As the practice\r\n\r\nof  Government is that the final accounts  for  the\r\n\r\nyear  can  only show those amounts received  during\r\n\r\nthe year, even though the amount may be received in\r\n\r\nthe  following year - this Budget is framed  in  this\r\n\r\nway - therefore, it is obvious that this $30,000, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  will appear in the 1961 Estimates  as  an\r\n\r\nincome  item.

I  think  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Farrer   Park  has   overlooked   or\r\n\r\nunderestimated the importance of making  an  impact\r\n\r\nupon  the  public  of Government  policies  in  all\r\n\r\nMinistries.  It  is important not only  to  provide\r\n\r\nservices but to make sure that they are provided in\r\n\r\na  manner which the public wants. It is because the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park and his colleagues have been\r\n\r\nunable  to understand the vital importance of  this\r\n\r\nlink  between  the Government and the  masses  that\r\n\r\nthey  met  with  disaster six months  ago.  We  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to impress upon him that this is  the  most\r\n\r\nbasic  and  fundamental issue, but I am  afraid  we\r\n\r\nhave so far met with very little success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, let me be the first to assure the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance that I am well aware  that  a\r\n\r\nParty  that  is  not rooted in the  masses  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  has very little chance at the polls.  I  am\r\n\r\nthe first to admit that, and it is always so in any\r\n\r\ndemocratic institution where the ballot box counts.\r\n\r\nUnless  you  get  the confidence of the  masses - and\r\n\r\nsince the masses count these days - you will not  get\r\n\r\nyour seat. But what worries some of us and quite  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  people outside, Mr Speaker, is this.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's   Action  Party  is  deeply   and   firmly\r\n\r\nentrenched  in  the  masses. That,  of  course,  is\r\n\r\naccepted  by all of us - there can be no doubt  about\r\n\r\nthat,  and the Minister for Finance need not repeat\r\n\r\nthat  since  we accept it. As a corollary  of  that\r\n\r\nstatement,  since they are the people  who  are  so\r\n\r\ndeeply  rooted in the masses - and there  are  43  of\r\n\r\nthem  sitting  in front of us - is it  necessary  for\r\n\r\nthem to engage the services of six others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hate to\r\n\r\nrefer  the Member for Farrer Park to all  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said on this subject. But can I ask  him  one\r\n\r\nsimple  question? Does he suggest that a Government\r\n\r\nis  not entitled to use such resources that it  has\r\n\r\nat its disposal to put across the policy of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Government, so that it can be again  returned\r\n\r\nby  the mass support of the people? If that is  the\r\n\r\nbusiness   of   government,   and   if   successful\r\n\r\ngovernment means not only governing well, but being\r\n\r\nable  to  convince the majority of the people  that\r\n\r\nwhat  you  are doing is in their interests  and  so\r\n\r\ncarry  them  with  you,  is there  anything  either\r\n\r\nunethical  or  improper that  a  government  should\r\n\r\nspend a minute portion of its resources in order to\r\n\r\nequip itself with the necessary personnel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put this to the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nSince 1945 the Blood Transfusion Unit has been  run\r\n\r\non the basis of a bottle of beer in exchange for  a\r\n\r\nbottle  of  British servicemen's blood. That  is  a\r\n\r\nfact;  the doctors will confirm it. The only people\r\n\r\nwho  have no psychological resistance to losing red\r\n\r\nblood  corpuscles are those who consider themselves\r\n\r\nto have a jot of it, partly because, having given a\r\n\r\npint  of  blood,  they are thereby discharged  from\r\n\r\ntheir  rather tedious duties for the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  and partly by the consolation of a bottle  of\r\n\r\nbeer.   That  is  the  way  in  which   the   Blood\r\n\r\nTransfusion Unit had been run. And because  we  are\r\n\r\nable to put across the message we have now for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  got a roster of something  over  6,000\r\n\r\ndonors  in a short campaign. Our target is  12,000,\r\n\r\nand  I think in due course of time we shall achieve\r\n\r\nthe target. These are simple elementary things.  No\r\n\r\nMinister is omniscient and omnipotent. We would  be\r\n\r\nthe  first  to  admit  it.  But  the  business   of\r\n\r\ncollective leadership means having at its  disposal\r\n\r\npeople  whose  energy  and drive  can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nadvantage  by  the  Government  in  furthering  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine the Member for Farrer Park not\r\n\r\nbeing happy about these things. In fact, I am  glad\r\n\r\nto know that all these little points we are scoring\r\n\r\ndisturb  him sufficiently to want to make  a  noise\r\n\r\nabout  Political  Secretaries.  I  think  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntribute  to  the Personal Secretary (Political)  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health that Mr Rajah considers it\r\n\r\nworthy of mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Farrer Park!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Minister for Farrer Park!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Not even Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not yet.

The Budget that the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nis  presenting;  the millions of dollars  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is budgeting for is intended  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem back into power when the proper time comes for\r\n\r\nthem to go to the polls. There can be no doubt that\r\n\r\nevery  action that the Government takes is intended\r\n\r\nto  bring  them back into power; they are not  such\r\n\r\naltruists.  When  people go into politics,  as  the\r\n\r\nMembers on the front Bench have done, they are  not\r\n\r\naltruists. They go in in order to seize  power  and\r\n\r\nto  keep that power, and nobody can blame them  for\r\n\r\nit. Politics is that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are that way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The Government can certainly use\r\n\r\nGovernment machinery in the way it should  be  used\r\n\r\nin  order to bring itself back into power. But  the\r\n\r\nsuspicion  that rests with a large section  of  the\r\n\r\npublic is this, and this is what the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nalso complaining of: that the Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nhave been given jobs merely because at the time  of\r\n\r\nthe  elections they were not able to compete at the\r\n\r\npolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a matter\r\n\r\nof  fact, it is quite wrong. My Political Secretary\r\n\r\nwas  not  at  that time unable to  compete  at  the\r\n\r\npolls. For divers reasons he did not compete at the\r\n\r\npolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to deal with people who\r\n\r\nare  almost psychopathic in their suspicions of the\r\n\r\nmotives   of  other  people.

But  being  honourable\r\n\r\nmen, we are charitable enough to believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat in the course of the next five years, we shall\r\n\r\nbe  able slowly to re-educate them to believe  that\r\n\r\nthere are people in this world who, whilst they are\r\n\r\nnot  altruists,  have sufficient political  courage\r\n\r\nand conviction in what they believe, to fight for a\r\n\r\ncause   even  if  it  is  against  their   personal\r\n\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the minds and the thinking of that\r\n\r\ngeneration  that  formed the Progressive  Party.  I\r\n\r\nknow  them  well.  I  sat near  their  councils.  I\r\n\r\nlearned  all  about  the elections -  the  way  they\r\n\r\nfought.  I was once an election agent! For  one  of\r\n\r\nthem! I understand their motivations. But what I am\r\n\r\nhoping to do in the course of the next few years is\r\n\r\nto  bring  home to even dyed-in-the-wool  renegades\r\n\r\nthe  message, that if self interest is all that you\r\n\r\nwork upon, and is the only incentive you offer your\r\n\r\nsociety,  then in this revolutionary situation  you\r\n\r\nmust  fail.  Let  me  explain  the  difference   in\r\n\r\ntechnique which is brought about by a difference in\r\n\r\nbasic approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back as a very young man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You are not old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Much younger than now! Sir, I\r\n\r\nwas  employed by persons who obviously  shared  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park's philosophy of life -  that\r\n\r\nnobody  is  an  altruist. I was  employed  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis,  \"Here  is a good return for money.\"  Having\r\n\r\nemployed me for my legal skill, I was then  carried\r\n\r\nover  to  the  political  front  to  further  their\r\n\r\npolitical  cause. And being sufficiently  malleable\r\n\r\nand  willing  to learn, I went in and  learned  all\r\n\r\nabout it. That is the reason why we understand them\r\n\r\nso  thoroughly.  If you want to  have  an  election\r\n\r\nmeeting - as  indeed  the  President  or  the   Vice-President of his Party used to hold in places  like\r\n\r\nKampong  Amber, and nobody wanted to go and  listen\r\n\r\nbecause  the  message was not worth the  listening,\r\n\r\nyou  then arrange a satay party and a joget party.\r\n\r\nThen you arrange for $400 to be given to your clerk\r\n\r\nwho  arranges to give it to a friend of the headman\r\n\r\nwho,  in  turn,  is  supposed to  give  it  to  the\r\n\r\nheadman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you ultimately go to the satay party, you find\r\n\r\nthat  not $400 worth of satay is being distributed.\r\n\r\nThen  you are left with the riddle whether  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  the  headman did get the $400 but  decided\r\n\r\nnot to buy so much satay, or whether it was because\r\n\r\nalong  the  way,  each went and bought  and  ate  a\r\n\r\nlittle  satay before the party itself. Then in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of all these festivities you make a  speech.\r\n\r\nBut not so the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hold a meeting, there is a message, and\r\n\r\nthe   people   come   and   listen.   Last   week's\r\n\r\ndemonstration is an object lesson to those  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side - that if you want to carry the  mass  of\r\n\r\nthe  people with you, you have to offer  more  than\r\n\r\njust your personal interest. True, the business  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole  expenditure is to further the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore; hence the way the $300\r\n\r\nodd millions being spent next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not give jobs to people who do not deserve\r\n\r\nthem.  When  we  make  political  appointments,  we\r\n\r\nexplain  it and carry it openly through. The  whole\r\n\r\nthing is simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for us, as indeed it must be\r\n\r\nfor  every  Party  that believes  in  organisation,\r\n\r\neffectiveness and efficiency, the yardstick is  the\r\n\r\nefficacy  of  the  instruments  you  use.  If  your\r\n\r\ninstruments are blunt, if you hire a lot  of  duds,\r\n\r\nthen  you  must  fail.  If you  can  get  effective\r\n\r\nweapons   with   which  to  forge  your   policies,\r\n\r\nimplement  your plans, then you will succeed.  That\r\n\r\nis  the  acid  test. And that  is  why  I  say  the\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretary  to the  Minister  for  Health\r\n\r\ndeserves  to  be complimented, as he  has  received\r\n\r\nspecial attention from the Member for Farrer  Park.\r\n\r\nI hope, in the course of the debate in the next few\r\n\r\ndays, that there may be other Political Secretaries\r\n\r\nwho will receive this commendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I must congratulate the Prime Minister\r\n\r\non  the clever words he used to talk about a simple\r\n\r\nissue  before  the House.

I would hasten to assure  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health that these questions were  put\r\n\r\nnot  with  a view to embarrassing him, but  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  eliciting information  in  respect  of  a\r\n\r\nMinistry  which  is engaging the attention  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. There is a feeling amongst the public,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  that this Ministry is understaffed,\r\n\r\nand   they  hear  various  reports  about   doctors\r\n\r\nresigning for one reason or another which  we  need\r\n\r\nnot  go into now because it is not relevant to this\r\n\r\nparticular debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, as I see it, from the replies given\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry, would appear to be  this:  that,\r\n\r\ngenerally  speaking,  at the lower  levels  of  the\r\n\r\nmedical professional services, they seem to be  all\r\n\r\nright. But in the middle and higher echelons, there\r\n\r\nseems to be a lack of officers and, if I may put it\r\n\r\nthis way, even the Ministry is a bit doubtful about\r\n\r\nthe  capacity of the medical officers now with them\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not seem to want to confirm  them.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I would have imagined that before\r\n\r\na   person   is   put  in  an  acting  appointment,\r\n\r\nsufficient consideration would have been  given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and possibly by the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  as  to whether that  person  is  a  fit\r\n\r\nperson  to  hold  that particular appointment;  and\r\n\r\nnormally a two or three months' period is given  in\r\n\r\norder  to test him out in that appointment.  If  he\r\n\r\ncomes  through,  as  he  normally  should,  he   is\r\n\r\nconfirmed  and, in 99 cases out of 100  all  acting\r\n\r\nappointments  are confirmed. Otherwise,  it  merely\r\n\r\nmeans  that  he  should never have acted.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  acting posts have been held for  six  months\r\n\r\nand   some  for  nine  months.  I  appreciate   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  of  the Ministry of  Health  in  that\r\n\r\nMalayanisation  has caught them on the  wrong  foot\r\n\r\nwith the result that a large number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the senior posts are vacant; the Ministry  also\r\n\r\nfaces difficulties in promoting from below and  are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to recruit from abroad for reasons  best\r\n\r\nknown  only  to  themselves. The service  therefore\r\n\r\nsuffers.  And  if the service suffers,  it  is  the\r\n\r\npublic at large that will suffer as a result of the\r\n\r\nlack   of  experienced  medical  officers  in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  These services, Mr Speaker, are  manned\r\n\r\nby human beings. With the best intent in the world,\r\n\r\nhuman beings can only work that hard and no harder.\r\n\r\nIf  you  make  them  work  beyond  their  capacity,\r\n\r\nparticularly  professional men  or  even  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  men  who work physically, or  beyond  their\r\n\r\nendurance,  they  will  not  give  that   efficient\r\n\r\nservice which they could normally have been able to\r\n\r\ngive  if they had been able to do their work  at  a\r\n\r\npace more in keeping with their profession. As  far\r\n\r\nas I can see it, in the Health Ministry, the middle\r\n\r\nand  higher echelons of the services concerned  are\r\n\r\nbeing overworked. They can stand this overwork  for\r\n\r\na  period  of time, but if it is made to  last  too\r\n\r\nlong,  there must be a breakdown in their  physical\r\n\r\ncapacity to carry on their work. That indeed  would\r\n\r\nbe tragic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge upon the Ministry to use every\r\n\r\npossible   endeavour   to  confirm   these   acting\r\n\r\nappointments  already held for several  months;  if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry is not satisfied with the ability  of\r\n\r\nthe    officers,   now   holding    these    acting\r\n\r\nappointments, to fill the posts, then the  Ministry\r\n\r\nmust tell them as firmly as it can that they are no\r\n\r\ngood,  relieve them of their posts and go elsewhere\r\n\r\nfor filling these posts. I feel that the main thing\r\n\r\nis  that  the efficiency of the Department must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained. In a service, particularly the  medical\r\n\r\nservice where the efficiency and the quality of the\r\n\r\nservice would depend on the type of persons manning\r\n\r\nit,  it is important that these doctors should  not\r\n\r\nbe overworked. The present staffing position is, as\r\n\r\nI  see it, Mr Speaker, and as it emerges from  the\r\n\r\nreplies, that there is a definite shortage  at  the\r\n\r\ntop levels. And if this shortage continues for some\r\n\r\nfurther time, there is a grave danger of the  whole\r\n\r\nof the Medical Services breaking down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the\r\n\r\nanswers  to my questions submitted on the  11th  of\r\n\r\nNovember, it was stated that out of 31 doctors  who\r\n\r\nhave  resigned or have given notice of resignation,\r\n\r\n29  doctors  have  been recruited since  1st  June,\r\n\r\n1959.  I  have since found out, Sir, that these  29\r\n\r\ndoctors,  regarded as having been  recruited  since\r\n\r\n1st  June,  1959, were already in  the  service  as\r\n\r\nhouse-men; so that the actual position  was  in  no\r\n\r\nway  alleviated, but the shortage has remained  the\r\n\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand that negotiations are now\r\n\r\ntaking place on the basis of the special allowances\r\n\r\nthat have been offered by the Finance Minister.  In\r\n\r\nthe midst of these negotiations, Sir, we regret  to\r\n\r\nsay  that the Press reported that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  intends to recruit 60 doctors from  abroad.\r\n\r\nNow,  to  some of the doctors in the service  here,\r\n\r\nthis  is a form of intimidation when they are  just\r\n\r\nin  the midst of negotiations. If it is proposed to\r\n\r\nrecruit 60 doctors from abroad, naturally they must\r\n\r\nbe offered more attractive terms than those offered\r\n\r\nto  local  doctors. That would mean  some  overseas\r\n\r\nallowance,  and passages too must be paid.  And  if\r\n\r\nextra  expenditure has to be incurred, it seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that we may as well offer an inducement to  our\r\n\r\nown  local doctors to remain in the service. It  is\r\n\r\nno  use  having another form of expatriate officers\r\n\r\ncoming here on contract and then losing our own. It\r\n\r\nis  better  for us to retain those who are  already\r\n\r\nhere with some experience than to get new ones, and\r\n\r\nto  let  them go away and to replace them with  new\r\n\r\nones again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, if an adequate incentive were\r\n\r\ngiven,  those  who are intending  to  resign  would\r\n\r\nremain  and those who have just resigned  and  have\r\n\r\nnot  taken  up private practice may be  induced  to\r\n\r\ncome  back.  I  hope that can happen  because  that\r\n\r\nwould  resolve the situation in a more constructive\r\n\r\nway than by just recruiting 60 doctors from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathise with the Minister for Health, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  the  midst of his  troubles  with  his\r\n\r\ndoctors,  there  has  also been  trouble  with  his\r\n\r\nnurses.

That  naturally got  their  goat  because,\r\n\r\nhaving  lost a portion of their pay, they  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing asked to pay more for residing in the hostel.\r\n\r\nSo  naturally they are now up in arms. I hope, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will be successful  in  solving  his\r\n\r\ntroubles  with the doctors and nurses so  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  will have the service of doctors and nurses\r\n\r\nwho  are  quite satisfied and will give  them  good\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have had a session with donkeys,\r\n\r\nand now we are having a session with goats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I\r\n\r\nmade  a remark yesterday about the cuts in the T.B.\r\n\r\npatient  allowance, I was accused  of  having  made\r\n\r\nwild allegations without investigations from proper\r\n\r\nand reliable sources. I am sure that the statistics\r\n\r\non  the chart at the exhibition during Loyalty Week\r\n\r\nare  proper and reliable sources of information.  I\r\n\r\nnoticed on one of the charts that during the months\r\n\r\nof   September  and  October,  the  aids  for  T.B.\r\n\r\npatients had gone down by over $30,000 each  month.\r\n\r\nThat is why I asked the question. The Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Health preferred  not\r\n\r\nto  call  the  cutting down of the  maximum  from - I\r\n\r\nbelieve  he said - $300 to $180 a cut, neither  would\r\n\r\nhe  admit that the cutting off of the high cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  allowance  was a cut. But  the  fact  still\r\n\r\nremains that there have been cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am about to bring up is not an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  try  and discredit  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth,  but I would like to point out  that  there\r\n\r\ncould  be  misunderstanding in  the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  In  the Straits Times of 5th December,  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Government intends to recruit\r\n\r\nabout  60  overseas doctors on short-term contracts\r\n\r\nto  relieve the pressure on medical officers in the\r\n\r\nunderstaffed service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very laudable move, Sir. But unfortunately, as\r\n\r\nhas  been pointed out before, it has happened at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  local doctors  are  voicing  their\r\n\r\ngrievances.  And  just in case it  is  taken  as  a\r\n\r\nthreat  or  a  warning  to  local  doctors,  I   am\r\n\r\nmentioning  this so as to give the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  confirm his real motive, that he is  trying  to\r\n\r\nrelieve  the  pressure on medical officers  in  the\r\n\r\nunderstaffed  service,  because  certain   releases\r\n\r\nmight cause doubt when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We shall not like to make such a move unless we\r\n\r\nare sure that it would not be possible to make this\r\n\r\nrecruitment from local sources or if doctors to  be\r\n\r\nrecruited locally are not satisfied with the  terms\r\n\r\non which they are recruited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it comes to my mind that if the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  recruits overseas doctors whenever  doctors\r\n\r\nhere are not satisfied with their terms of service,\r\n\r\nwhat  are trade unions for? Trade unions are  there\r\n\r\nto  negotiate in cases of grievances voiced by  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  That is the proper channel, and  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Minister should try to settle it with the local\r\n\r\ndoctors  before  he  tries  to  bring  in  overseas\r\n\r\ndoctors. Nevertheless, Sir, I would like to confirm\r\n\r\nthat I do not think that that is the intention. But\r\n\r\nit says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If doctors to be recruited locally are not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the  terms  on  which   they   are\r\n\r\nrecruited...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This might have occurred not only to me but to some\r\n\r\nother  people as well, and it would be very  useful\r\n\r\nif  the Minister could confirm that that is not his\r\n\r\nintention. I would like to point out sincerely that\r\n\r\nit might boil down to this: if the Government takes\r\n\r\nthe  attitude that whenever they have staff who are\r\n\r\nnot satisfied - they recruit from overseas - the whole\r\n\r\ncivil   service   will  one  day  or   another   be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied over one thing or another and then  we\r\n\r\nwill find that the whole civil service will consist\r\n\r\nof expatriates. If Government adopts this attitude,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  know  they  will not,  they  cannot  stop\r\n\r\ncommercial firms adopting it and what will  happen?\r\n\r\nI  suppose  the one and a half million people  will\r\n\r\nsoon  have  expatriates replacing them.  Then  what\r\n\r\nhappens  to  us? Where will it land us? In  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries I suppose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Timbuctoo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I know this is not the\r\n\r\nintention,   Sir,  because  it  will  destroy   the\r\n\r\nprinciple of trade unionism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  weaken trade unions.

It  is  public  knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health is understaffed. The Member said\r\n\r\nthat  in the lower echelons the position is not  so\r\n\r\nbad  as it is in the higher echelons, and he  asked\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health to confirm the position  in\r\n\r\nthe higher echelons. To the questions raised by the\r\n\r\nMembers   of  the  Opposition  earlier,   we   have\r\n\r\nindicated  that  every step has been  or  is  being\r\n\r\ntaken to resolve these difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to be straightforward in my reply to the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin. I admit that there is a feeling\r\n\r\nof  discontent  among  some  of  the  staff  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  I  do  not  deny  this.  Therefore,   my\r\n\r\nofficers  and  advisers are taking  every  possible\r\n\r\nstep  to  overcome this feeling of discontent.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin has said that, in reply to  his\r\n\r\nquestion,  I  said  that we had  recruited  29  new\r\n\r\ndoctors  to replace those doctors who had  resigned\r\n\r\nsometime  this  year.  He further  said  that  this\r\n\r\nmatter  had  also  become public knowledge  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health. Later, the Member  touched  on\r\n\r\nthe  Press  release  which I  had  personally  made\r\n\r\nstating  that the Ministry of Health would  recruit\r\n\r\n60  doctors from abroad. I will be very frank  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member and also with the other two Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  who  spoke.  I  did  not  do  this\r\n\r\narbitrarily.   This   step  has   been   taken   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Medical and Dental  Officers'\r\n\r\nAssociation and experts. They have agreed with  the\r\n\r\nsteps and actions that I have taken. In fact,  they\r\n\r\nwelcome the action that I have taken, because  they\r\n\r\nare  of the opinion that the officers in the  lower\r\n\r\nechelons  will thus have an opportunity to  advance\r\n\r\ntheir  status  in the medical field. If  we  engage\r\n\r\noverseas  doctors  on  a  contract  basis,  we  can\r\n\r\nrelease  our  young  and  capable  doctors  to   go\r\n\r\noverseas  and advance their studies in the  medical\r\n\r\nfield.  I  did not do this arbitrarily. As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier  on, this was done in concurrence with  the\r\n\r\nMedical  and  Dental Officers'  Association  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin said that I am faced with\r\n\r\nmany problems and difficulties over the question of\r\n\r\nnurses.  He  said that the nurses, who  are  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, are not very happy with the new scheme of\r\n\r\nservice  whereby  their pay will  be  deducted  for\r\n\r\nhostel  accommodation,  water  charges,  etc.  This\r\n\r\nscheme  of  service  was  not  introduced  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the day. This was introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government, and I am quite sure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  will not deny this fact.  Also  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai in the Chamber here  will\r\n\r\nnot  deny  this.  This scheme of  service  was  put\r\n\r\nforward  by  the previous Government.  The  present\r\n\r\nGovernment is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerely  carrying it out. However, at the moment,  I\r\n\r\nam  still receiving representations from the Nurses\r\n\r\nUnion and this matter is under consideration. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  intend to dwell further on this subject  here,\r\n\r\nbut  I  will  find ways and means of solving  their\r\n\r\nproblems and difficulties. As I said earlier on,  I\r\n\r\nam sympathetic over this matter. We will wait until\r\n\r\na solution is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten talked about T.B.\r\n\r\nallowances.  This  will  be  dealt   with   by   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary who spoke on  this  matter\r\n\r\nyesterday. He will surely give a satisfactory reply\r\n\r\nto  her.  As  regards  the  Press  release  of  5th\r\n\r\nDecember  mentioned by the Member  for  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nconcerning  60  doctors, I have  already  explained\r\n\r\nthat this matter has been dealt with in concurrence\r\n\r\nwith  and  is  welcomed  by the  Medical  Officers'\r\n\r\nAssociation.  I think the 20 specialists  who  have\r\n\r\njust returned from overseas on scholarships awarded\r\n\r\nto them will be serving in the Government, and I do\r\n\r\nnot  see any possibility, as has been mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mountbatten, that when these people\r\n\r\nreturn  they  will be discontented. We should  face\r\n\r\nthe future together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park expressed much concern about\r\n\r\nthe unbalanced state of affairs in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth.  I do not blame him for not being  able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the background of the medical  services.\r\n\r\nThe  higher  posts, the upper ranks of the  medical\r\n\r\nservice   concerned,  consist  of  two   types   of\r\n\r\npersonnel  so  far as the Budget is concerned:  (1)\r\n\r\nthe  administrative medical officers  and  (2)  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  medical officers. I  think  when  the\r\n\r\nMember pointed out that the Ministry of Health is\r\n\r\nunbalanced   at   the  top,  he   refers   to   the\r\n\r\nadministrative people, because the various items he\r\n\r\nwent over just now refer to medical administrators.\r\n\r\nIn  answer to this shortage, Sir, perhaps I may  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to give a little background to the medical\r\n\r\nservices in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously there were two systems of medical\r\n\r\nservices  in Singapore which, after the  war,  were\r\n\r\nunified  into  one.  During  the  fight  for   this\r\n\r\nunification  of medical services, a lot  of  senior\r\n\r\nofficers left\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  was  just after the Second World War.  Since\r\n\r\nthen  the  service  was held by  relatively  junior\r\n\r\npeople.  There  was some degree of  reluctance  all\r\n\r\nalong  on the part of doctors or graduates  to  get\r\n\r\ninto   the   administrative  service  because   the\r\n\r\nprofessional service is the more lucrative part  of\r\n\r\nmedical  practice. Therefore, there was a  shortage\r\n\r\nin  the  administrative medical service  which  can\r\n\r\nonly  now  be remedied slowly. Many of the  medical\r\n\r\nofficers in acting administrative posts are  rather\r\n\r\nnew  and  therefore cannot be confirmed in a  short\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the top professional\r\n\r\nposts  should have been filled by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth. I will now inform him that these posts were\r\n\r\nleft  vacant  at  the request of  the  Medical  and\r\n\r\nDental   Officers'  Association.  The   Association\r\n\r\ncontends that if we fill these top posts,  it  will\r\n\r\nblock  the  young  members  of  the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nprofession  from coming up. These posts  were  left\r\n\r\nvacant  at  the  request of  the  Association.  The\r\n\r\nMember  says that the doctors have been  given  too\r\n\r\nmuch  work.  Perhaps he does not realise  that  all\r\n\r\nalong  doctors  have been overworked in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  all along there has been a shortage of medical\r\n\r\nstaff.  Despite all his fears, which are unfounded,\r\n\r\nthe  standard of medical care in Singapore has gone\r\n\r\nup.  One  cannot  say that one is  not  maintaining\r\n\r\nefficiency  when  the standard is still  going  up.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  if  the  Member visits some  of  the  free\r\n\r\nhospitals,  for  example, Kandang Kerbau  Maternity\r\n\r\nHospital, Trafalgar Home or Woodbridge Hospital, he\r\n\r\nwill  find  that the standard of medical  care  has\r\n\r\ngone up considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin queries the Minister's\r\n\r\nwritten answer to his questions to the effect  that\r\n\r\n29   medical  officers  have  been  recruited  from\r\n\r\namongst  house-men and were not fresh recruits.  It\r\n\r\nis  perhaps pertinent here, Sir, to say that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  basic  difference between a houseman  and  a\r\n\r\nmedical officer. In fact, for a houseman to  become\r\n\r\na  medical  officer, he must break his service  for\r\n\r\none  day. A houseman's pay is $400 a month,  and  a\r\n\r\nmedical officer's pay is $820 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth.   They  are  also  in  a  totally  different\r\n\r\ncategory,  because a houseman is not  qualified  to\r\n\r\npractise  unless under supervision.  The  fact  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reply  did not include  the  number  of\r\n\r\nhouse-men who entered the service after 1st June is\r\n\r\nbecause that question was not asked. It is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple case here. Twenty-nine officers shifted from\r\n\r\nthe   housemen  status  to  the  medical  officer's\r\n\r\nstatus.  And  even  more  officers  came  into  the\r\n\r\nhousemen's status to fill the 29 vacancies  created\r\n\r\nby these 29 people who were promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's concern about the Ministerial\r\n\r\nannouncement of the 60 recruitments from  overseas,\r\n\r\nno  time  could have been more opportune  than  the\r\n\r\npresent  to make it, because the announcement  came\r\n\r\nafter  the Minister for Finance had announced  that\r\n\r\nour   local  officers  would  be  given  specialist\r\n\r\nallowances.  I cannot imagine any other  time  more\r\n\r\nopportune than the present to announce that we  are\r\n\r\nrecruiting these officers. I do not see how it  can\r\n\r\nbe construed that there is intimidation as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  recruitment  of  these  60  officers.  The\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  these  60  medical  officers  from\r\n\r\noverseas   has  had  the  support  of   the   Staff\r\n\r\nAssociation  itself. It may be said  that  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries doctors are being paid much less than  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  therefore no  specialist  or  extra\r\n\r\nallowances will be incurred in getting people here.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Members of the Opposition already know that\r\n\r\nin  India it is possible to employ a doctor for 400\r\n\r\nrupees a month, which is only about $250 here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of nurses has been adequately dealt\r\n\r\nwith by the Minister himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten also wanted to open up\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  T.B. allowance.  I  have  stated\r\n\r\nclearly  that the allowance was open to much  abuse\r\n\r\nand  people who were not entitled to the  allowance\r\n\r\nwere getting it. It has been reported in the papers\r\n\r\nthat people owning five taxis were collecting these\r\n\r\nallowances. It is because this Government  is  very\r\n\r\njudicious  in the expenditure of public funds  that\r\n\r\nsuch    savings    were    made    after    careful\r\n\r\ninvestigations.  Certainly  the  hon.  Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten will not agree that one should get $300\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper month just because one has T.B. This amount  is\r\n\r\nmuch  more  than one gets if one goes to work.  The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Mountbatten  again  raised   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  timing in regard to overseas  medical\r\n\r\nrecruits.   I  thought  she  was  just  trying   to\r\n\r\nemphasise a point. I stress again that this is  the\r\n\r\nbest time to make such an announcement, because  it\r\n\r\nwas  made  after  the announcement that  specialist\r\n\r\nallowances would be given to these people. And just\r\n\r\nto  relieve  her mind of the fear that the  service\r\n\r\nwould  be  plagued  with expatriate  officers,  the\r\n\r\npeople  who come to work in Singapore on short-term\r\n\r\ncontract  will  only  be on short-term  service.  I\r\n\r\nstated  yesterday in my speech that in the meantime\r\n\r\nwe  are  sending some 80 to 120 local  boys  abroad\r\n\r\nannually  to study medicine. Those are  the  people\r\n\r\nwho  will  come  back  and  solve  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nshortage  ultimately, and not  the  expatriates  on\r\n\r\nshort-term contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I confess to\r\n\r\na  feeling  of  disgust  when  I  listened  to  the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of the Member for Tanglin and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten.  They  pretended  to  feel  very\r\n\r\nconcerned over the plight of nurses and doctors.

The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  forgot  that this was something  that  was\r\n\r\nnegotiated in the past.

All  the\r\n\r\nother  points  have already clearly been  answered.\r\n\r\nAll the speeches from the Opposition side - from the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park, the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nand   the   Member   for  Tanglin - were   like   the\r\n\r\nallegations from the Member for Cairnhill. They are\r\n\r\nall  trying  to frighten the public and  trying  to\r\n\r\nshow  to the House that there is a skeleton in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health's cupboard, namely, that  there\r\n\r\nis  a  grave  shortage of staff, that everybody  is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied,   that  unless  something   is   done\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  go down in ruins,  and  that  very\r\n\r\nshortly we will be dying. Surely the facts are  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  Not  being medical officers, they appear  to\r\n\r\nthe medical officers to be championing their cause.\r\n\r\nIn  this House we have doctors who know more  about\r\n\r\nthe  subject  than  they do. The hon.  Members  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  give  the  impression  to  the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession   that,  but  for  them,   the   medical\r\n\r\nprofession  would not have all the  attention  they\r\n\r\nare  supposed to have.

We also know the hard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  that the doctors in the hospitals are  doing.\r\n\r\nBut  we  would  like  to  remind  the  Members  for\r\n\r\nTanglin,  Mountbatten  and  Farrer  Park  that  the\r\n\r\ndoctors at the present moment are not treated as if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  human beings.  No,  Sir.  They  are\r\n\r\ntreated very well indeed. If the hon. Members  were\r\n\r\nto  go to the hostels, they would straightaway  see\r\n\r\nwhat a beautiful mansion the doctors have, to begin\r\n\r\nwith. When we were students, Sir, we never had such\r\n\r\namenities. We had only tiny rooms to study, and  we\r\n\r\nhad  the lights out at certain hours. Now they have\r\n\r\neverything thrusted on them. May I also say that  I\r\n\r\nwas  one  of  the doctors working in  the  hospital\r\n\r\nbefore?  Let me remind these people who  talked  so\r\n\r\nmuch  about  hard work that we worked  the  hardest\r\n\r\nduring the war and we never complained. I can also \r\n\r\nassure  you, Sir, that our pay was very much  less. We \r\n\r\nonly received $75 or $250. Now, of course, they receive $400 or $820 or \r\n\r\neven higher.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after all that has been said, it does not mean that we do not appreciate the good work being\r\n\r\ndone  by  the medical profession in the  hospitals.\r\n\r\nWhat  we want to say is that the medical profession\r\n\r\nis only one part of the community in Singapore and,\r\n\r\nas  such, as medical officers, they have to try and\r\n\r\nlook  at  everything as a whole and in  its  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  In addition, Sir, I  would  even  say\r\n\r\nthat from our side we are all the time thinking  of\r\n\r\nour  medical  colleagues outside. We are  bound  by\r\n\r\nsome  invisible ties which are not seen by  a  non-medical  man. In fact, at the present  moment,  the\r\n\r\nmedical  doctors are the first to benefit from  the\r\n\r\nextra allowance. It can be said they might be worse\r\n\r\noff  but for some of our medical colleagues in  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been\r\n\r\nalleged that we the Opposition here, have concocted\r\n\r\nour  own  views about the situation in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Health.

One  of  the\r\n\r\nimportant rules laid down in the General Orders  is\r\n\r\nthat  a civil servant shall not individually  lobby\r\n\r\nto foster his own case.

Now, in the face an example  like\r\n\r\nthat, is it to be wondered that the people who work\r\n\r\nin  Government  service are scared of  bringing  up\r\n\r\ntheir cases in the proper way, because of what  has\r\n\r\nhappened to one of their own leaders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin is unable to reason out his\r\n\r\ncase logically.

We are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  our  duty  as  a Government.

I\r\n\r\nshould hate to think that that would happen to  the\r\n\r\nmost  promising Prime Minister that South East Asia\r\n\r\nhas produced. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears\r\n\r\nthat because I had filed a number of amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe personal emoluments list to extract information\r\n\r\nalready in the mind and on the lips of everybody in\r\n\r\nSingapore  interested in the medical  service,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister comes to the conclusion that someone\r\n\r\nfrom the Medical Department must have come and seen\r\n\r\nme   and  given  information  which  led  to  these\r\n\r\nquestions.  Really, really! Now, does he  not  give\r\n\r\nsome  consideration to the capacity of  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  to do these things  on  their  own\r\n\r\naccount? Does he think that we must always be spoon-fed?  Why does he suggest that I approached medical\r\n\r\nofficers in the service or they approached me to do\r\n\r\nthis?  Has he a guilty conscience? What did  he  do\r\n\r\nwhen he was in the Opposition? Did he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubvert the civil servants? He did not, did he?

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshortage of doctors - and also the shortage of  other\r\n\r\nprofessional  men - is  part  of  the  old   Colonial\r\n\r\nsystem.  In running a Colony, the ruling power  had\r\n\r\nto  build up an apparatus with which it could carry\r\n\r\nout   its   policies  of  economic  and   political\r\n\r\nexploitation. As such, it had a tendency  to  limit\r\n\r\nthe  entry of doctors into the medical service,  so\r\n\r\nthat  those in the medical profession, particularly\r\n\r\nthose in private practice, would make so much money\r\n\r\nthat  they  would cling on to the Colonial  system.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, we cannot hope, in the course of five\r\n\r\nor   six  months  of  the  People's  Action   Party\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  remedy this state of  affairs.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  a  great majority of  the  doctors  are\r\n\r\nbehind  the new Government. We know that there  are\r\n\r\nsome doctors who are not behind the Government, and\r\n\r\nhave  left  to  advance their careers  outside  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service. We faced the same position when\r\n\r\nwe  were  in  the  City Council  when  the  doctors\r\n\r\nquitted.  Other  professional men also  quitted  in\r\n\r\norder  to advance themselves outside. But we  hope,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, that when colonialism is finally  got\r\n\r\nrid  of  and  when  we have trained  more  doctors,\r\n\r\nengineers and other professional men, the situation\r\n\r\ncan  be remedied. Today we are faced with the  same\r\n\r\nsituation   that  we  faced  when  the   expatriate\r\n\r\nelectrical  engineers  wanted  to  quit  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  When we went into the City  Council,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the  Pasir  Panjang  Power  Station  was\r\n\r\ncontrolled by expatriate electrical engineers,  and\r\n\r\nthere   was  not  one  local  qualified  electrical\r\n\r\nengineer  in  the Pasir Panjang Power Station.  The\r\n\r\nexpatriates had the run of the place. We  were  not\r\n\r\nwilling  to  give the $14 million which the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park wanted to give to them.  So  they\r\n\r\nthreatened to quit. Mr Speaker, we were left  with\r\n\r\nno  choice,  but to try to engage a  few  engineers\r\n\r\neither  from  Japan or from India  to  remedy  this\r\n\r\nsituation. In this instance, we can sympathise with\r\n\r\nthe position of the Minister for Health because not\r\n\r\nlong ago I was faced with the same position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now the Member for Farrer Park talked about the upper echelons of the medical\r\n\r\nservice   in   the   Government - the   shortage   of\r\n\r\nspecialists. If there is ever a shortage, who is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblame?  It is the fault of the Colonial system  and\r\n\r\nit  is also the fault of those who have abetted and\r\n\r\nwho  are  still abetting the Colonial system.  They\r\n\r\nhave never given our local people a chance to train\r\n\r\nthemselves in order to become specialists,  or,  as\r\n\r\nin  the case of certain professions like engineers,\r\n\r\nthey  have  never  been given a  chance  to  secure\r\n\r\npromotion  themselves. Not long ago, in  June  this\r\n\r\nyear, after the new Government came into office,  I\r\n\r\nentered  the room of a very famous planner  in  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. just  as  a  spot-check.

I  think  I\r\n\r\nshould  follow  up on that and let the  House  know\r\n\r\nwhat did happen to Mr Rajendra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember about two weeks\r\n\r\nbefore  he  was  charged, Mr  Rajendra  sought  an\r\n\r\ninterview  with me in my office and discussed  with\r\n\r\nme  what his position would be in the civil service\r\n\r\nif  he  championed  the cause of  the  local  civil\r\n\r\nservants. I said to him that it was open to anybody\r\n\r\nto   make   his  representations  to   the   proper\r\n\r\nauthorities in a proper manner, but that he  should\r\n\r\nbe  careful not to transgress the proper bounds  of\r\n\r\npropriety.  I reminded him of my own case.  I  told\r\n\r\nhim   that  when  we  were  fighting  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nauthorities here, I got into trouble because I  had\r\n\r\nspoken  the  truth. Amongst the things that  I  had\r\n\r\nsaid,  which were considered to be highly  improper\r\n\r\nduring the Ritson negotiations, was that I did  not\r\n\r\nconsider that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  expatriate officers in the civil service then\r\n\r\nwho   were  capable  of  implementing  the   Ritson\r\n\r\nrecommendations. I had very many meetings with  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  over that statement of mine. I  told  him\r\n\r\nthat that statement was not in any way critical  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  It  was  critical  of   my   own\r\n\r\ncolleagues - my    expatriate    colleagues.     But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  it was held that the  statement  was\r\n\r\nimproper and I was duly censured for it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajendra said that he felt it was his mission to champion the cause of the civil servants. He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  was troubled by his young  son  and\r\n\r\ndaughter who were always looking at the papers  and\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Mama, Papa would be getting into  trouble\r\n\r\nfor  all this.\" But nevertheless he felt it was his\r\n\r\nduty  to  go  ahead. The next thing  I  saw  was  a\r\n\r\nstatement attributed to him in the papers.  In  due\r\n\r\ncourse, the Government file came into my hands  and\r\n\r\nI  found  that the Prime Minister was  seeking  the\r\n\r\nadvice of the State Advocate-General on the correct\r\n\r\ncourse  of action to be taken with regard  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  Amongst my other duties, as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law, is my duty to deal with actions that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to take  in  regard  to  legal\r\n\r\nmatters.   These  are  always  sent   to   me   for\r\n\r\nconsideration  after they have been  considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  State Advocate-General. It was decided that  a\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  committee should be set  up  to  look\r\n\r\ninto   the   statements  of   Mr   Rajendra.   The\r\n\r\ndisciplinary committee was set up. I took a hand in\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of that committee. I had seen  the\r\n\r\npapers and I knew that Mr Rajendra had maliciously\r\n\r\nintended  a personal affront to the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nHe  had  seen me and had actually suggested  to  me\r\n\r\nthat he was determined to do this. Well, I did  not\r\n\r\ninterfere   in  that  matter.  It  was  within   my\r\n\r\ncompetence  to  go  before the  tribunal  and  give\r\n\r\nevidence.  My  evidence would have shown  that  his\r\n\r\nstatement  was  inspired by malice and  would  have\r\n\r\nreally prejudiced his defence. I did nothing of the\r\n\r\nsort.  We  played fair by him. He made his  defence\r\n\r\nand he was found guilty by the tribunal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am mentioning all this to the House to\r\n\r\nshow  that  we are not unreasonable with our  civil\r\n\r\nservants. I quite appreciate their difficulties  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  situation. I have been  a  civil  servant\r\n\r\nmyself  and have been closely associated with  many\r\n\r\nof them for very many years. I have found that many\r\n\r\nof them find it very difficult to adjust themselves\r\n\r\nto the present situation. I have senior officers in\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  who have come up to me  a  number  of\r\n\r\ntimes  and have tendered their written resignations\r\n\r\nto  me.  I  have  asked  them to  reconsider  their\r\n\r\naction.  I  have torn their letters up,  because  I\r\n\r\nknow  the difficult times that we are going through\r\n\r\nand  it  will take some time before they  can  make\r\n\r\ntheir  adjustments to the new situation. We do  not\r\n\r\nin  any way harass them. We are trying our best  to\r\n\r\nhelp them to come along with us in the tasks ahead.\r\n\r\nBut we must be quite sure about their attitude.  If\r\n\r\nwe  find that it is not a question of their finding\r\n\r\nit  difficult  to make these adjustments-that  they\r\n\r\nare out to try and frustrate what we are trying  to\r\n\r\ndo  for  the people of Singapore (all of us on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  benches  have made sacrifices  for  the\r\n\r\nthings that we believe in), if we find that  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething   different   which   is   behind   their\r\n\r\nreluctance  to assist the Government in the  things\r\n\r\nthat  we  are trying to do, then our whole attitude\r\n\r\nwill  have to be reconsidered. But I hope  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  never  be  necessary for  us  to  reach  that\r\n\r\ndecision, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $35,246,030 for Head 21 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 22 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nThio Chan Bee:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item (3) of sub-head\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since an\r\n\r\nitem  of a similar nature has been discussed  fully\r\n\r\npreviously, I beg leave to withdraw this notice  of\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is not moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 22 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (4) of  sub-head 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find from reading this budget that it is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Minister to create certain new\r\n\r\nposts  for  this new Economic Development Division.\r\n\r\nThere  is  already an Industrial Development  Board\r\n\r\nwith  a  director,  and  the Minister  has  already\r\n\r\nstated  that  he  is  seeking  the  recruitment  of\r\n\r\nexperts  from  overseas to  help  in  running  this\r\n\r\nIndustrial Development Board.

We were\r\n\r\ngiven to understand, however, Sir, that in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that Government money comes from the tax-payers of Singapore, there should not be this  kind\r\n\r\nof   discrimination   of   treating   children   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools  as  Government  children,  and\r\n\r\nchildren  in  non-Government schools as  not  being\r\n\r\nGovernment children. So it was decided to have some\r\n\r\nkind of allocation so that some scholarships should\r\n\r\ngo  to  the aided English schools and some  to  the\r\n\r\naided  Chinese  schools.  Now,  if  this  were   to\r\n\r\ndisappear  completely - unless there is an  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  it  will not - it could well be that in  future\r\n\r\nsomebody might interpret that all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   scholarships,   courses   and   fellowships\r\n\r\nincurring  Government  money  should  only  be  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  organisations. I  hope,  Sir,  that  an\r\n\r\nassurance will be given so that we will not go back\r\n\r\nto  that  kind  of discriminatory policy  and  that\r\n\r\nthese scholarships, courses and fellowships will be\r\n\r\navailable  to  all who deserve them, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are in Government or  non-Government\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, the item on\r\n\r\nassistance to aided schools - that has been  deleted\r\n\r\nfrom this sub-head, and provision of assistance for\r\n\r\naided schools has quite rightly been transferred to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education. The Member for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nraises   the  larger  issue  of  scholarships   and\r\n\r\nfellowships, and I was not quite clear in  my  mind\r\n\r\nwhat  sort of assurance he was seeking. But  I  can\r\n\r\nassure him that the money will be spent to the best\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see\r\n\r\nhere, under Establishment, there is a bracket which\r\n\r\nsays,  \"Now shown under Treasury Division\". Looking\r\n\r\nup  that section under Treasury Division, I  notice\r\n\r\nthat  (46)  is  the  item. It  says  \"Scholarships,\r\n\r\nCourses  and Fellowships\". Naturally I took  it  to\r\n\r\nmean  that  they have all been included  under  one\r\n\r\ngeneral  item. Therefore, the separate identity  of\r\n\r\nscholarships  would then be lost and, subsequently,\r\n\r\nin other budgets it would never be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Minister lost his pencil\r\n\r\nagain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I did not quite follow what\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin was driving at.  But  there\r\n\r\nare  two  matters.  One  is  that  scholarship  and\r\n\r\nfellowship  courses have been going  on  for  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time  and consist really of sending  doctors,\r\n\r\ncivil servants and so on abroad. That kind of  item\r\n\r\ncomes  under  this vote. The other matter  concerns\r\n\r\nthe  aided schools. That is quite a separate issue.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now the responsibility of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that\r\n\r\ncase, I will raise it when we come to Education.

The point I wish to  raise,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  is  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nConfidential Stenographer who in the year 1959  was\r\n\r\npaid  $7,800, but whose salary is now being  raised\r\n\r\nfrom  $7,800  to  $11,700, - quite a  rise,  however\r\n\r\nconfidential  the  stenographer  may  be.
