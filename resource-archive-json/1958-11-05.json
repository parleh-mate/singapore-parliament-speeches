The\r\n\r\nemphasis  of  this Exposition is national,  instilling\r\n\r\nloyalty   and   pride   in  Singapore   and   in   its\r\n\r\nconstitutional development, for at this  time  of  the\r\n\r\ncelebration it must be the wish of everyone of us that\r\n\r\nevery  citizen  in our predominantly young  population\r\n\r\nshould share the significance and exhilaration of that\r\n\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Constitution is coming to us because of our\r\n\r\nown  unity,  determination and  steady  constitutional\r\n\r\nefforts, and it gives us the reality and the substance\r\n\r\nof  freedom  in  our internal affairs. To  change  the\r\n\r\ntitle  and status of Colony for that of a State  is  a\r\n\r\nmajor and irrevocable step in our history and a matter\r\n\r\nof great pride and joy for our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of all exhibits in the Exposition will\r\n\r\nbe  on the achievement of self-government, but it  was\r\n\r\nclear  that,  without major Government  participation,\r\n\r\nthe  emphasis would not be readily understood.  It  is\r\n\r\nessential  that there should be a Government  Pavilion\r\n\r\nto  emphasise the fact, nature, extent and reality  of\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional change and to  show  the  advances\r\n\r\nalready   made  under  the  impetus  of   an   elected\r\n\r\ngovernment  which we expect will be the  greater  when\r\n\r\nthe   fully   elected   Government   under   the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution takes over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is important to emphasise the wide range\r\n\r\nof  services  which the Government  provides  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare,  prosperity and security  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Government Pavilion will come  as  the\r\n\r\nclimax of our activities in civic education whose  aim\r\n\r\nhas been to ensure that the fullest and widest use  is\r\n\r\nmade  of  the  opportunity to  vote,  which  has  been\r\n\r\nconferred by our citizenship legislation last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000 square feet have been reserved free of charge\r\n\r\nfor  the Government within the demarcated area of  the\r\n\r\nExposition.  The  Committee under the chairmanship  of\r\n\r\nthe Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr  M.\r\n\r\nP.  D. Nair) has been preparing plans and estimates in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the Ministries. It is  proposed  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a covered space of 60,000 square feet. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  two parts, each facing on to the main axis  of\r\n\r\nthe  Exposition; one showing the Government's part  in\r\n\r\nincreasing the wealth and economic prosperity  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  the  other showing the  wide  range  of\r\n\r\nsocial services in health, education and welfare which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  provides for the people.  Details  of\r\n\r\ncost  have not yet been worked out to an extent  which\r\n\r\nallows the Govermnent to ask for a specific sum to  be\r\n\r\nvoted,  but  every  means is being sought  to  achieve\r\n\r\neconomy by using materials which will be required  for\r\n\r\nother  purposes next year and by borrowing of material\r\n\r\nand  equipment.

Sir, I would like  to  emphasise\r\n\r\nthat  this was not a change of policy but a tightening\r\n\r\nup  of the application of our policy. Previously,  all\r\n\r\nbooks   had   been  allowed  to  enter  except   those\r\n\r\nspecifically banned. This was appropriate  when  there\r\n\r\nwas  still a certain amount of freedom for publishers,\r\n\r\nand  classics  and  textbooks in particular  were  re-published  untouched from the freer  days  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the change of policy in China and the\r\n\r\nsubordination  of all publishing houses,  and  through\r\n\r\nthe  process  of rectification of all writers  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party, this laxity could not be allowed  to\r\n\r\nremain  unchecked,  for with an import  of  a  million\r\n\r\npublications  a month from China and Hongkong,  there\r\n\r\ncan  be  no guarantee that the assessment and  sifting\r\n\r\ncan  be  complete. It is therefore the  procedure  now\r\n\r\nthat  only  books which are specifically exempted  for\r\n\r\nthe cultural and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacademic  value of their contents, and which have  not\r\n\r\nbeen reduced by editing, presentation or selection  to\r\n\r\nthe  level of Hsueh Hsi textbooks, will be allowed  to\r\n\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate, Sir, that this has caused temporary\r\n\r\nhardship to those in the book trade, but every step is\r\n\r\nbeing taken to speed up our processes of assessment of\r\n\r\nexisting books, so that exemptions among those already\r\n\r\nhere and for the future can also be given speedily. It\r\n\r\nhas  been  encouraging that the grounds of our  policy\r\n\r\nhave  been  generally  accepted  and  that  there   is\r\n\r\nappreciation  of the need at this time  of  democratic\r\n\r\nnation-building  to  prevent  the  weight   of   other\r\n\r\nexternal ideologies and nationalisms drowning our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the logic of citizenship in action, and it is\r\n\r\nfor us, by our mental reactions and by our actions, to\r\n\r\nshow  that  citizenship based on exclusive and  active\r\n\r\nloyalty  to Malaya is a reality, and an axiom  of  our\r\n\r\npolitical thought and action. If it can be shown to us\r\n\r\nthat  this  action  pf  ours  weakens  the  forces  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy   or  inhibits  the  growth   of   our   new\r\n\r\npatriotism,  then  we  are  in  the  wrong.

It   is  the  clear  assumption  of   our   new\r\n\r\nconstitution   that  it  is  the  last   stage   before\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger with  the  Federation.  We\r\n\r\naccept, with understanding but without loss of faith in\r\n\r\nour ultimate objective, the position that it is not the\r\n\r\npresent  policy of the Federation that there should  be\r\n\r\nmerger now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sir, Singapore cannot afford a running\r\n\r\nbickering  battle  with the Federation  hoping  to  win\r\n\r\nevery time; for not only will that snot be to our long-term  economic interest, but it is no way to  show  our\r\n\r\nreadiness  to share our fortunes with them  for  better\r\n\r\nand  for worse, in riches and in poverty. This does not\r\n\r\nmake  us a colony or a slave of the Federation, or  any\r\n\r\nother  noun  which  is culled from  the  dictionary  of\r\n\r\ndenunciation.  We  must  be  realistic  and  even   the\r\n\r\npartnership of equals and independents assumes a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of give and take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My appeal is, therefore, that in all our discussions\r\n\r\nof  issues  of this kind we must start from  a  Malayan\r\n\r\nassumption and we must show towards the Federation  the\r\n\r\nconsideration we expect from them. This may not  be  an\r\n\r\neasy  policy to follow, but again we must realistically\r\n\r\nface  facts and not ignore them. And one of these facts\r\n\r\nis  that  if we claim to be a part of a Malayan  nation\r\n\r\nseeking the rightful union which circumstances deny  us\r\n\r\ntoday,  we must act as a part of a Malayan nation  here\r\n\r\nand now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember the essential elements of policy such\r\n\r\nas  citizenship, education and multilingualism which we\r\n\r\nare  able to follow without question, and ask ourselves\r\n\r\nbefore we let loose the full flood of criticism whether\r\n\r\nthe  issue  is important enough to put the constitution\r\n\r\nand  the  policies  it enshrines in jeopardy.  Only  by\r\n\r\ntrial and error, approaching each issue reasonably, can\r\n\r\nwe begin to reach agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be the will and the mood; and then our\r\n\r\nfuture  will be the stronger together, because  of  the\r\n\r\nmutual  confidence, the mutual co-operation  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  worked out voluntarily.

It  would  be  useless  to  approach  this\r\n\r\nflooding problem on a short-term vote-catching  basis.\r\n\r\nIt  would be fairly easy sometimes to shift the  flood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater  off the land of political supporters and on  to\r\n\r\nthe  land of political opponents. But I would not wish\r\n\r\nto  do that and I am sure that my honourable political\r\n\r\nopponents on the Opposition Benches would not wish  me\r\n\r\nto  do  it  to them. The only way to deal  with  flood\r\n\r\nproblems  is  by proper overall schemes after  a  full\r\n\r\nstudy of the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that flooding cannot be dealt with\r\n\r\nas  simply  as some people suppose. It is not  just  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of deepening or widening the channels  of  the\r\n\r\ndrains.  If deepening brings the bottom of  the  drain\r\n\r\ndown to sea level, then the sea will flow up the drain\r\n\r\nat  high tide, and this is not a desirable result. The\r\n\r\nonly way of stopping this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to have a fairly expensive tidal gate at the mouth\r\n\r\nof  the drain, such as we have put in at the mouth  of\r\n\r\nthe Geylang River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even where the land is above sea level,\r\n\r\ndeepening  of  a  drain may have serious  results.  It\r\n\r\nlowers the water table and dries out the subsoil.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  the Queenstown area, the land  has  been\r\n\r\nreclaimed by putting earth-fill on top of swamp mud. A\r\n\r\ndeepening of the drain would lower the water table and\r\n\r\ndry  out the foundations and thus affect the stability\r\n\r\nof the houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even where no buildings would suffer from deepening\r\n\r\nthe  drains, lowering the water table will  draw  away\r\n\r\nthe  water  from the roots of the farmers'  crops  and\r\n\r\nthen they cannot grow their vegetables for the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that flood difficulties are very\r\n\r\nmuch  increased as development proceeds. This operates\r\n\r\nin  two  ways. Firstly, every new piece of development\r\n\r\nincreases  both the size and the speed of the  run-off\r\n\r\nof water. Along Bukit Timah Road, each new estate that\r\n\r\nis developed sends more water down more quickly to the\r\n\r\nlower  parts  of  the  roads. In the  same  way  along\r\n\r\nThomson  Road on Sunday last I was asked by  residents\r\n\r\nto  look at a local flooding problem. Although it  was\r\n\r\nsome hours after the rain had stopped, I found a house\r\n\r\nwhere  six inches of watery mud was still standing  in\r\n\r\nand around the house and this was being accumulated by\r\n\r\nbeing  trapped  between the old and  the  new  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoads.  Residents nearby on the other side of the  new\r\n\r\nThomson Road telephoned me on Monday to say that their\r\n\r\nhouses which had never been flooded before, were being\r\n\r\nflooded now. I have not yet got a final report on this\r\n\r\nparticular area. I quote it because it illustrates the\r\n\r\ndanger of new development sending flood waters down to\r\n\r\npeople at the bottom of the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development also causes flooding difficulties when it\r\n\r\nputs  valuable  capital investment on  to  land  which\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise  have  been used  for  drainage.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  flooding below the Peirce Reservoir  to\r\n\r\nwhich I was just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreferring  could have been dealt with by a  drain  out\r\n\r\ntowards Ponggol but before the drain could be surveyed\r\n\r\nor  constructed  or even planned the appropriate  line\r\n\r\nfor  it  had been covered by development at  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGarden Estate and that way out is now closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I should make is the problem of\r\n\r\nachieving co-ordination between different authorities.\r\n\r\nThe  City  Council in the City area has to  deal  with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater  which  is flowing down to them from  the  rural\r\n\r\narea  and  in the rural area the decisions which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  or will be made about the three big City Council\r\n\r\nreservoirs  in  the  centre of the island  affect  the\r\n\r\nplanning of flood control works from Mandai right down\r\n\r\nto Potong Pasir. To co-ordinate plans between separate\r\n\r\nauthorities is never easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth general point is that adequate flood control\r\n\r\nschemes are very expensive. They not only take  a  lot\r\n\r\nof   construction  work  but  they  also  involve  big\r\n\r\nrequirements for land; and in the overcrowded state of\r\n\r\nSingapore, land requirement means also heavy costs for\r\n\r\nland  clearance  and resettlement. Hon.  Members  will\r\n\r\nhave  seen  in the Press reports of the complaints  by\r\n\r\nresidents in the Aljunied Road area who were reluctant\r\n\r\nto  move off the land required for the drains for  our\r\n\r\nsecond tidal gate in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for these general points which hon. Members\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  bear in mind as I go forward  with  a\r\n\r\nbrief  account  of  the flooding which  occurred  last\r\n\r\nMonday  and  how  it  is related to  the  plans  which\r\n\r\nGovernment has carried out or now has in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reports of flooding from the eastern side\r\n\r\nof the island. The flood control scheme at Bedok seems\r\n\r\nto have been 100 per cent successful. A little further\r\n\r\nwest,  in  the Geylang Serai area, our new tidal  gate\r\n\r\nwhich  is associated with some drainage works  carried\r\n\r\nout  by the City Council seems also to have been fully\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  Higher up in the Lorong  Tai  Seng  area,\r\n\r\nthere was some water lying about when I visited it and\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid that situation will remain and will have\r\n\r\nto be accepted until we have completed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour second tidal gate in the Kallang swamp  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side of Aljunied Road and cleared the  land\r\n\r\nand  dug  the drains which will carry the  water  away\r\n\r\nfrom the Airport Road area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reports of significant flooding from Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  but,  as I mentioned just now, there  was  some\r\n\r\nlocal  flooding  all  the way  up  Thomson  Road  from\r\n\r\nKampong San Teng as far as the Sembawang Hills Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the eastern side of the island. As far as\r\n\r\nreports  to  me  go, there was no  other  significant\r\n\r\nflooding  there. The rainfall on the eastern  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  island  was not so heavy as the rainfall  on  the\r\n\r\nwestern side of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out earlier, development along the Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah Road produces an increasingly rapid run-off  and\r\n\r\nconcentration  of  water along Bukit  Timah  Road  and\r\n\r\nthrough  to  Orchard Road. Although the rainfall  this\r\n\r\nyear  was  very much less than it was in  the  serious\r\n\r\nflood  period of 1954, the flood levels at the  bottom\r\n\r\nof Bukit Timah Road were considerably higher than they\r\n\r\nwere  in 1954. For example, in front of the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, there were 2\u00bd feet of water and there were\r\n\r\nthree  feet  of water at the Orchard Road/Scotts  Road\r\n\r\njunction, the water coming there from the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flooding of this area is one of the major\r\n\r\nproblems  which  will have to be  dealt  with  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The  only practical solution is  to  get  the\r\n\r\nwater  away  from here by a very big ring  drain  run-\r\n\r\nfling  along Whitley Road across Thomson Road  through\r\n\r\nthe south of Toa Payoh down to the Kallang swamp. This\r\n\r\nwill involve very large works and, consequently, a lot\r\n\r\nof money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further south, we have the very serious and rapidly\r\n\r\nincreasing  flooding  along  the  catchment   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore River. At Upper Queenstown, there was a  big\r\n\r\naccumulation  of water and further down  in  the  low-lying  area, the floods were as much as three feet  in\r\n\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, flooding has been created where it had\r\n\r\nnot  previously existed by the very large  development\r\n\r\nworks being carried out at the head of the catchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the third major flood control scheme which the\r\n\r\nGovernment is carrying out. Putting it briefly, we are\r\n\r\ncutting through the line of the Railway and propose to\r\n\r\nrun the water away to the west into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an increasing flood area in the City\r\n\r\naround  Robinson  Road,  Boon  Tat  Street  and  Cecil\r\n\r\nStreet.   My   colleague,  the  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, informed this Assembly in July  1955  that\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  had  schemes  for  pounding  areas\r\n\r\nbeneath the area of Boat Quay and Telok Ayer at a cost\r\n\r\nof  about $450,000. I have no recent information about\r\n\r\nCity  Council proposals for work in this area but  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience caused to this vital commercial area  by\r\n\r\nflooding must be considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not had reports of any serious flooding\r\n\r\nfurther west in the Jurong and Ama Keng areas, though,\r\n\r\nno  doubt,  in  any  heavy rain  there  will  be  some\r\n\r\naccumulation of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not conceal from hon. Members that, had the\r\n\r\ntide  been higher or had the rainstorm gone on longer,\r\n\r\nthe  flooding  in the areas affected on  Monday  would\r\n\r\nhave been considerably worse. The essential problem is\r\n\r\nthat  the water has to be got away to the sea, and  if\r\n\r\nthe  drains  are not big enough, it cannot  get  away;\r\n\r\nthere  is a bottleneck and the water lies around until\r\n\r\ngradually  it finds its way out. This constitutes  the\r\n\r\nspecial  danger for Singapore: whilst a  single  storm\r\n\r\nwill  clear itself in a reasonable period of  time,  a\r\n\r\nsuccession  of storms can lead to a very  considerable\r\n\r\naccumulation of water with all the very serious danger\r\n\r\nand damage to crops, to property, to livestock and  to\r\n\r\ncommercial activities which are inevitably involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of flood control will, I am afraid,\r\n\r\nremain  with Singapore for a good many years  to  come\r\n\r\nand   will   involve  quite  considerable  cost   and,\r\n\r\nconsequently,  quite considerable taxation  before  it\r\n\r\ncan  be fully dealt with. In the 3\u00bd years that I have\r\n\r\nbeen  concerned  with this matter, the Government  has\r\n\r\nspent,  exclusive  of  land  costs,  approximately  $1\r\n\r\nmillion on flood control works and is committed  to  a\r\n\r\nfurther  $1\u00bc   million for completion of  the  Geylang\r\n\r\nFlood prevention scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the Ulu Pandan diversion of the Queenstown flood\r\n\r\nwaters. In addition, the City Council has done quite a\r\n\r\ngood  deal of work but I have not got precise  figures\r\n\r\nfor their expenditure. It is probably safe to say that\r\n\r\nthe  work done so far is only a small part of the work\r\n\r\nand the cost which will be necessary to give Singapore\r\n\r\nreasonable freedom from flooding in all areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members are well aware of the serious effects on\r\n\r\nSingapore  of the world trade recession and  they  are\r\n\r\nalso  aware  of the very considerable sums which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  found, and necessarily will have to continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  found,  to  provide education for  our  enormously\r\n\r\nexpanding  school-age population and for  medical  and\r\n\r\nother  social services. I do not want to prejudge  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  which may be made by successive Governments\r\n\r\nafter the next general elections. I cannot attempt  to\r\n\r\nsay what priorities may in future be attached to flood\r\n\r\ncontrol  schemes  on  the  one  hand,  and  to  social\r\n\r\nservices  or  to  other forms of  development  on  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, no immediate prospect of this\r\n\r\nGovernment  undertaking any new  major  flood  control\r\n\r\nschemes apart from the completion of the works I  have\r\n\r\nreferred  to - at Paya Lebar, Geylang and Ulu  Pan-dan.\r\n\r\nBecause  of this, I have reluctantly agreed  to  allow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  Drainage Adviser to retire. In the 3\u00bd  years  in\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has been working here, he has  completed  a\r\n\r\nmassive job of making an overall survey of the  causes\r\n\r\nof  flooding on this island and he has worked out  the\r\n\r\nschemes which will have to be carried out in order  to\r\n\r\nremove  the flood problem from us. He has also carried\r\n\r\nout  the important scheme at Bedok and has got us well\r\n\r\nadvanced  with the schemes for the Geylang/Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\narea  and  for Ulu Pandan. He has worked  under  great\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and his achievements have  been  limited\r\n\r\nnot  by  his capacity but by the ability of Government\r\n\r\nto  finance  the  necessary schemes. It  is  with  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  regret that I have agreed to his  retirement\r\n\r\nbut  he does leave behind him the general plans  which\r\n\r\ncan  be brought into action at any time when the funds\r\n\r\nare available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the\r\n\r\nMinister tell us the approximate cost of dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe Bukit Timah Road problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think that it will be safe to\r\n\r\ngive any figure which could be relied on.

Please proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> As I have stated, the cost of\r\n\r\neducation  now  absorbs about a quarter of  Government\r\n\r\nrevenue. The reasons for this are well known.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  Government's  policy to  expand  the  scope  and\r\n\r\nprovision  of  educational facilities. The  number  of\r\n\r\nschool-going children has steadily increased  and  the\r\n\r\ncost  per  pupil has tended also to rise. During  this\r\n\r\ntime, the education rate on the value of property  has\r\n\r\nbeen no higher than two per cent and it has yielded  a\r\n\r\nmere  $1.6 million in 1957 against the total  cost  of\r\n\r\neducation  of  over  $57  million  in  1957.  If   the\r\n\r\neducation  rate  is  to remain an item  of  Government\r\n\r\nrevenue,  it  is reasonable to raise it in  conformity\r\n\r\nwith  the  increased cost of education. It is proposed\r\n\r\ntherefore  to  raise the rate to four per  cent.  This\r\n\r\nwill  yield an estimated revenue of approximately $3.4\r\n\r\nmillion in 1959. The increased rate will be assessment\r\n\r\non  the value of property in the City and in the rural\r\n\r\narea  for  next  year. Notices of such assessment  are\r\n\r\nissued in November of the year before and in order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the early issue of notices, I  have  asked\r\n\r\nthat this Bill be taken through all the stages at this\r\n\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

We  would\r\n\r\nlike  to know why he has arrived at the figure 4,  not\r\n\r\n4.5,  5 or 5.5.

This  two per  cent  increase  is  for\r\n\r\neducation, a cause to which we are all committed,  and\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure on which has increased by  leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds  during the last few years. This  has  happened\r\n\r\nbecause of the increase in the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren attending school and I do not see how  anyone\r\n\r\nin  his  right senses can object to this two per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease.  But, as I said, we must see that  this  two\r\n\r\nper cent increase will be put to good use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in this House has uttered more warnings than I\r\n\r\nhave  that we have to be very careful regarding public\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   particularly  on  buildings,   as   the\r\n\r\ncarefree  spending  days  of colonial  government  are\r\n\r\nover.  My prediction has been proved correct. We  have\r\n\r\nnow  reached  the  end  of our  reserves.  Government,\r\n\r\nhowever,  has  at last realised this and has  suddenly\r\n\r\nstopped many projects approved by this House. But  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  more  schools and  hospitals  cannot  be\r\n\r\nstopped.  It must continue, and more must be built  to\r\n\r\nprovide facilities for our growing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one case, I must say the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nhas  realised this and I congratulate him. After  much\r\n\r\npersuasion, his Ministry has agreed to relax the rules\r\n\r\nrequiring spacious playing-fields before plans for the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of schools can be approved.

I am sure that the whole House\r\n\r\nwill  agree  that money must be spent most  effectively\r\n\r\nand  wisely.  Sir,  I consider that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation should not be portrayed as a bad man who  has\r\n\r\nbetrayed the cause of Chinese education. Now, this Bill\r\n\r\nasks  for  more  money  from the predominantly  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  of Singapore. Sir, all along, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nour  courageous and hard-working Minister for Education\r\n\r\nhas been condemned and termed as a destroyer of Chinese\r\n\r\nculture. If the Minister would take this opportunity to\r\n\r\ncompare  the  so-called Ten-Year Plan for education  of\r\n\r\nthe  then colonial Government with that of the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment during the last 3\u00bd years, it would help the\r\n\r\npublic,   especially  the  Chinese  intellectuals   and\r\n\r\nChinese  students, to know more exactly about  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   spends   money   on   Chinese   education.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  the  outcry  of  discrimination  against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation is going on mainly on the question of capital\r\n\r\ngrant  for school buildings as applications for capital\r\n\r\ngrant  for Chinese school buildings seem always  to  be\r\n\r\ndelayed  by the Singapore Improvement Trust or  because\r\n\r\nof  other  factors. But so far the Government  has  not\r\n\r\ntaken  effective  steps  to  help  any  Chinese  school\r\n\r\nmanagement committee to put up a building. It  is  also\r\n\r\nvery slow in granting such applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of the salary of Chinese school\r\n\r\nteachers,  there  is an outcry against the  experienced\r\n\r\nteachers  receiving less pay than some of their  former\r\n\r\nstudents. In other words, the salary scale for  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  is chaotic. Nobody understands why it  should\r\n\r\nbe  so.  Some say \"Oh, we are experts, and we  must  be\r\n\r\nspecially  recognised.\" Others say,  \"No,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nUniversity degree cannot be recognised.\" I think it  is\r\n\r\nhigh  time  for  the  Government to  give  a  clear-cut\r\n\r\nstatement  on this vexed question of the salary  scales\r\n\r\nof Chinese teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is to urge the Government to give more\r\n\r\naid to the Nanyang University. Last month, the Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  that  financial aid was to  be  extended  to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. I should imagine that if financial\r\n\r\naid  had  been  granted  two years  ago,  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity would be in a better position today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill which\r\n\r\nis  to increase the education rate from two per cent to\r\n\r\nfour  per  cent will touch my pocket to the  extent  of\r\n\r\nsomething like $10. I am quit happy to pay that because\r\n\r\nI  know  that  I  am  getting much more  for  the  many\r\n\r\nchildren  that I send to school. I think everybody  who\r\n\r\nis  in a position to help Government in providing  more\r\n\r\nmoney for the young people should rejoice at this  step\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Government to help the young people.  But\r\n\r\nwhat is uppermost in my mind now is that there will  be\r\n\r\n16,000 young students of about 12 years old sitting for\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment common primary examinations and the  result\r\n\r\nof  this will be that 11,000 of such children will  be\r\n\r\nthrown  out  into  the streets without  any  means  of\r\n\r\ngetting into a regular secondary school. Of the 11,000\r\n\r\nchildren  who  will  be out in the  streets,  probably\r\n\r\n1,000 or so will be lucky enough to get into afternoon\r\n\r\nschools,   private   schools  or  Government   evening\r\n\r\nschools, but there will still be that large number  of\r\n\r\nabout 10,000 young people who will not know what to do\r\n\r\nwith  themselves. I Think that with this  increase  in\r\n\r\nrevenue,,  we  must  find a way to  help  these  young\r\n\r\npeople. We must not leave them without employment  and\r\n\r\nwithout anything useful for them to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly think, Sir, that the education that we\r\n\r\nare  having now tends to make almost everybody a  pen-pusher.  We have many other lines that we must accept.\r\n\r\nI certainly feel that in a large city we not only want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclerks, managers and business executives, but we  also\r\n\r\nwant  fitters,  electricians  and  plumbers.  We  want\r\n\r\npeople  not  only on the level of engineers,  who  are\r\n\r\nhighly  qualified people, but also those who will  be\r\n\r\njust  able  to  effect some sort of  repair  and  help\r\n\r\nthemselves in seeking employment or earning a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking that, for the 10,000 young people,\r\n\r\nsomething  must be done for them. Some sort of  school\r\n\r\nmust be set up for them, a school that will teach them\r\n\r\na trade, to be able to repair simple faults in radios,\r\n\r\nteach  them about simple plumbing lines, all sorts  of\r\n\r\nthings  at  a  level lower than even the Junior  Trade\r\n\r\nSchool.  I  am thinking of this because it  will  then\r\n\r\nenable the young people to know a trade and so earn  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood. If they cannot help themselves, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  a liability to society. If they cannot earn enough\r\n\r\nmoney,  they will know where to get it, by fair  means\r\n\r\nor  foul.  We should try to see that they are assisted\r\n\r\nalong correct lines and not be misled by criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, apart from this question of young\r\n\r\nchildren  and unemployment, there is the  question  of\r\n\r\nGovernment policy in helping Chinese schools. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappen  to  be  connected with  a  number  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  being on the Board of Managers, and  in  one\r\n\r\ninstance I find that the Education Department has been\r\n\r\nwilling to help in recommending an acre of land in the\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng Hospital burial ground for the building\r\n\r\nof  a school. But then it seems that the Department of\r\n\r\nEducation  is not influential enough to help,  and  so\r\n\r\nthe Land Office must also be brought into the picture.\r\n\r\nThe  Planning Department must also have its  say  and,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  in all, the assistance to the school seems to  be\r\n\r\nrendered  in such a fashion that it does  not  give  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  that  help  is being handed  over  willingly.\r\n\r\nThere   is  a  lack  of  co-ordination  in  all  these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernments Departments - where one Ministry recommends,\r\n\r\nthe  other  Ministry holds it up. That  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nbad.  I would say that if Government is going to help,\r\n\r\nif the Minister says, \"We will help certain schools in\r\n\r\ncertain  projects\",  all the other  Ministries  should\r\n\r\nassist  in  such a project. I have another case.  This\r\n\r\nhappens to be the case of a school of which I happened\r\n\r\nto  be  Chairman. We built a school for 18 classrooms,\r\n\r\nthree  storeys high. We wanted to have another  storey\r\n\r\nto give added facilities. I was a Member of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on the Education Bill and we all know  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   always  a  lack  of  space   for   school\r\n\r\nplaygrounds.  The  Minister at that time  assured  the\r\n\r\nOpposition that the problem of playing fields will not\r\n\r\nbe  an obstacle to school building and so on. However,\r\n\r\nit  spells  quite  differently when it  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust. As my colleague, the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya Lebar said, the S.I.T. has  its  own\r\n\r\nrule  to obstruct all these matters. We have been told\r\n\r\nnot to proceed with the building of another storey  to\r\n\r\nprovide added facilities to the children. There  is  a\r\n\r\nlack of playing fields which, in this particular case,\r\n\r\ncomprises  five  or  six basketball  courts.  In  such\r\n\r\nschools as the one in Telok Ayer Street and the one in\r\n\r\nClemenceau Avenue, there are no playgrounds at all.  I\r\n\r\nfail  to see why we could not give a directive to  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. to assist Government in the execution  of  its\r\n\r\npolicy  by  helping  all people  who  are  engaged  in\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.07 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nproposal of Government to increase this Education Rate\r\n\r\nfrom  2  per cent to 4 per cent. When I looked at  the\r\n\r\nPaper, as the hon. Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon\r\n\r\nMong)  said just now, I was shocked to see that 11,000\r\n\r\nstudents will be left behind, not knowing what  to  do\r\n\r\nunless assistance could be given from other quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if we want peace and harmony in this\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  fortunate people should help  the  poor\r\n\r\nones.  My  only worry is this - as the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew)  has  asked  just\r\n\r\nnow - how  did the Government come to this figure  of  4\r\n\r\nper  cent? Is that the right figure that is needed for\r\n\r\nthis  education assistance? I do hope that  Government\r\n\r\nwill  think  carefully, but the  people  do  not  mind\r\n\r\ncontributing  more. Once and for all,  how  much  have\r\n\r\nthey  got to contribute; they get tired of having such\r\n\r\nappeals over and over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.09 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question has\r\n\r\nbeen  asked why Government has increased the Education\r\n\r\nRate from 2 to 4 per cent and not to any other figure.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  for  this  is  that  since  the  cost  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  is  continuing  to  rise,  and  since  this\r\n\r\nGovernment will only plan for the next new government,\r\n\r\nI  thought that the increase should be related to  the\r\n\r\neducation  expansion plan for next year.  Therefore  I\r\n\r\nhave chosen this rate, to ask for an increase of, as I\r\n\r\nsaid  in my speech, from $1.6 million to $3.4 million,\r\n\r\nan  increase  of  $1.8 million,  which  will  be  just\r\n\r\nsufficient to plan for a standstill budget so that the\r\n\r\nexpansion which has been committed will carry on,  but\r\n\r\nno  new  projects will be carried out  by  Government.\r\n\r\nThat  is the main reason for the increase from  2  per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent to 4 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concern of several Members over the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  throwing out,  as  they  say,  11,000\r\n\r\nchildren into the streets, I must say that this is not\r\n\r\na  correct  statement.  11,000 children  will  not  be\r\n\r\nthrown into the streets. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  sure  some  of them will be given  places  in  the\r\n\r\nJunior Trade School. Many of them will, of course,  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  into the evening schools run by  Government.\r\n\r\nIf  necessary, the evening schools will be expanded to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsorb   those   young  persons  whom  the   Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  think will benefit by secondary education.\r\n\r\nI  have stressed to this House quite a number of times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  evening  schools cater for those  who,  for  one\r\n\r\nreason   or   another,  cannot  gain  admission   into\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools,  but  that  they  will  be   given\r\n\r\neducation on subjects which will lead to their sitting\r\n\r\nfor examinations held by the Royal. Society of Arts or\r\n\r\neven the Cambridge School Certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  case of his own school where  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  S.I.T. was obstructive. Well, this  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst time that I have heard him air his complaint  in\r\n\r\npublic.  I have not personally been informed of  this.\r\n\r\nIf  he had told me personally about it, I am sure that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  would have got all the co-operation from me.  Even\r\n\r\nduring  the Select Committee on the Education  Bill  I\r\n\r\nstated  that the lack of playing fields should not  be\r\n\r\nan  obstruction  to the expansion of school  building,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  areas  where there  is  congestion  of\r\n\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) said\r\n\r\nthat  there are always delays in the matter of capital\r\n\r\ngrants.  He makes it out that the delay is always  due\r\n\r\nto  Government, but I must say - I am sorry that  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  here to hear it - that usually such delays are due\r\n\r\nto  the Committees of Management themselves. They have\r\n\r\nbeen  repeatedly told to submit their claims or  their\r\n\r\napplication for capital grants before June in the year\r\n\r\nbefore  the grant that is to be given. The reason  for\r\n\r\nthis is to enable the Government to vet the plans,  to\r\n\r\nsee   that   every  thing  is  in  order  before   the\r\n\r\napplication  is  put  down  into  the  Estimates   for\r\n\r\napproval  by  this  House. Usually the  Committees  of\r\n\r\nManagement  of these schools come any time  they  like\r\n\r\nwith inadequate plans or inadequate requirements,  and\r\n\r\nwhen they are asked to complete those requirements  or\r\n\r\nto give us more information,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  usually take a long time; and when they do come,\r\n\r\nit  is  usually after the Estimates have been prepared\r\n\r\nand  they  have to wait for another year before  those\r\n\r\nEstimates  can be put down into the budget. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  delay  is  not  due  to the  Government.  If  the\r\n\r\nmanagers  o these Management Committees will cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  the  Education Department and  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nrequests  required, I am sure things would  have  been\r\n\r\ndealt with more speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of teachers' salaries has also been\r\n\r\nbrought up. The recognition of qualifications for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  fixing  salaries for the  teachers  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  that  is determined not by  me  but  by  the\r\n\r\nindependent   Public  Service  Commission,   and   the\r\n\r\nteachers in Chinese schools are paid according to  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Public Service Commission. I think the\r\n\r\nquestion   of  salaries  especially  of  the   Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  will be resolved very soon. The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  also  mentioned something  about  aid  to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. Well, the  aid  to  be  given  to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University is based on the deficit  disclosed\r\n\r\nin   the   accounts   submitted  by   the   University\r\n\r\nauthorities. Hon. Members must realise that we  cannot\r\n\r\ngive  more  than the deficit, otherwise it  will  mean\r\n\r\nthat  Government  will be enabling the  University  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  surplus, and this should not be  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich public funds should be handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi also touched on the black\r\n\r\nname  supposed to have been associated with  me  as  a\r\n\r\ndestroyer  and betrayer of Chinese culture, and  asked\r\n\r\nme  to  mention  something about the present  plan  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the Ten-year plan. The Ten-year  plan,\r\n\r\naugmented by the Five-year plan, envisages expenditure\r\n\r\non   Chinese  education,  subject  to  correction,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  of  something  like $300,000,  or  less  than\r\n\r\n$300,000  for  ten or fifteen years; whereas  in  1957\r\n\r\nMembers  will realise that on Chinese education  alone\r\n\r\nthe  Government has spent over $10-million as compared\r\n\r\nwith  the Ten or Fifteen-year plan envisaged  with  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure of only $300,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> How do you spend it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I think that is a sufficient\r\n\r\nanswer to those who say that I betray Chinese culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Did you spend it carefully?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I think I have answered all the\r\n\r\nquestions, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill [Mr Chew Swee Kee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read the Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NANYANG UNIVERSITY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to provide for the establishment and incorporation\r\n\r\nof  the  Nanyang University and for matters  connected\r\n\r\ntherewith\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee); read the First time, to be read a Second time on\r\n\r\nWednesday, 3rd December, 1958, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to make provision for encouraging the establishment\r\n\r\nand development in Singapore of industrial enterprises\r\n\r\nby way of relief from income tax\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Communications and Works (on behalf of the Minister for Commerce and Industry, Mr J.

Clause 68 as it  stands  is\r\n\r\nincomplete  and  it had to be presented  in  that  form\r\n\r\nbecause  the  question  of  the  appointment   of   the\r\n\r\nChancellor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  under  discussion by both the Governments  and  no\r\n\r\nagreement  had been reached by the time this  Bill  was\r\n\r\npresented.  My attention has been drawn to it  by  you,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  I  have given the undertaking that  at  this\r\n\r\nsitting I shall have that clause deleted and I shall do\r\n\r\nthat at the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I touch on the features of this Bill, I want\r\n\r\nto  say at the outset that University teaching in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  is  not a new thing. Indeed for  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears  University expansion has been taking place  both\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and i&' the Federation  of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nexpansion  in  Singapore is a natural thing  because  a\r\n\r\nUniversity  must grow. The expansion in the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  is  also  natural because  the  University,\r\n\r\nalthough  situated  in Singapore, has  been,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nserving both territories and it is our duty to see that\r\n\r\nuniversity  teaching is provided in the  Federation  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in  Singapore. Members  will  recall  that  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry was appointed on the  University\r\n\r\nof Malaya in 1957 under the Chairmanship of Dr Aitken,\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham. A copy\r\n\r\nof  the  report  has  already been  presented  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  I  am  sure Members  are  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of that Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development schemes recommended by the Aitken\r\n\r\nCommission  have  been  the  subject  of  very  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration by both the Governments of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  and Singapore, and we have jointly  decided\r\n\r\nthat,   in  keeping  with  the  development   in   both\r\n\r\nterritories,  an  alternative  scheme  which  aimed  at\r\n\r\ncreating  two  Divisions  of the  University  of  equal\r\n\r\nstatus - one in each territory - would be more appropriate.\r\n\r\nA  local  Joint Constitutional Committee  and  a  Joint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance  Committee were then jointly appointed  by  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments under the common Chairmanship of  Dato\r\n\r\nSir  Clough Thuraisingham and the Bill before the House\r\n\r\ntoday is the result of the recommendations of these two\r\n\r\njoint  committees.  I  want to  place  on  record  here\r\n\r\nGovernment's  appreciation of the efficient  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  two  committees have dealt  with  the  work\r\n\r\nentrusted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want Members to bear in mind that when they\r\n\r\nconsider  this  Bill  the  Federation  of  Malaya  has\r\n\r\nemerged   as  an  independent  Nation,  and  that   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  grant of full internal self-government\r\n\r\nis imminent. These factors and the rapid growth of the\r\n\r\nUniversity  have  made  it  necessary  for   the   two\r\n\r\nDivisions of the University to be created. I also want\r\n\r\nMembers  to  note that under this Bill, the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya will continue as one unit, but at the  same\r\n\r\ntime  the  two  Divisions  in  Singapore  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya will be given as much autonomy as\r\n\r\npossible.  The present Constitution embodied  in  this\r\n\r\nBill   is  based  on  certain  criteria  which  would,\r\n\r\nfirstly,   maintain   academic  standards;   secondly,\r\n\r\npreserve  the unity of the University and provide  for\r\n\r\ncentral  co-ordination  and control  of  high  policy;\r\n\r\nthirdly, accord to the Divisions the maximum degree of\r\n\r\nautonomy  consistent with the maintenance of  academic\r\n\r\nstandards  and the preservation of the  unity  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity;    fourthly,    permit    the     possible\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  any  future Divisions  or  separate\r\n\r\nuniversities   with  a  minimum  of  difficulty;   and\r\n\r\nfifthly,  be  simple  to operate  with  a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nstatutory  authorities and thus  incorporate  wherever\r\n\r\napplicable   recommendations  made   by   the   Aitken\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to allay the fears of Members of this House,\r\n\r\nindeed  of  members of the public, that the University\r\n\r\nhas  been  split  and  that  the  policy  of  the  two\r\n\r\nDivisions may, in future, go contrary to each other or\r\n\r\nmay  even compete with each other. The provision of  a\r\n\r\nsmall  single Central Council above the two Divisional\r\n\r\nCouncils of the two divisions will see to it that  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya will have a single  policy,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  interests  of  one Division  will  not  run\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  interests of the other.  High-level\r\n\r\npolicies  will be determined by this Central  Council,\r\n\r\nwhile day-to-day administration of the Divisions  will\r\n\r\nbe  the responsibility of the Divisional Councils. The\r\n\r\nprinciple of responsible government has been  followed\r\n\r\nin  the  draft of this new Constitution so  that  each\r\n\r\nauthority in the University will be responsible to the\r\n\r\nother.  For  example,  the  Central  Council  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsists  of  the Chairman of each Divisional  Council\r\n\r\nand the Chairman of the Standing Finance Committee  of\r\n\r\neach  Divisional  Council, among  other  members.  The\r\n\r\nchief  executive head of the University is  the  Vice-Chancellor  and  the  chief  executive  head  of  each\r\n\r\nDivision is the Principal and they are responsible  to\r\n\r\neach   other   through  membership  of   the   various\r\n\r\nauthorities provided under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight difference in the membership of the\r\n\r\ntwo  Divisional  Councils  in  that  there  are  three\r\n\r\nGovernment  appointees  on  the  Singapore  Divisional\r\n\r\nCouncil  as  against four appointees of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong and one appointee of the Conference  of\r\n\r\nRulers on the Kuala Lumpur Divisional Council. I  want\r\n\r\nto stress here that the difference in the Constitution\r\n\r\nof  the two Governments has made it necessary that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   representation  on  the  two   Divisional\r\n\r\nCouncils  should  be  different. The  connecting  link\r\n\r\nbetween  these two Divisional Councils on the official\r\n\r\nside  is  provided  by  the presence  of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  appointee  on  the  Federation  Divisional\r\n\r\nCouncil and a Federation Government appointee  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Divisional Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My statement will be incomplete if I do not say\r\n\r\nsomething  about  the Students'  Union.  I  know  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House are aware of certain statements\r\n\r\nmade  by  representatives of the University of  Malaya\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union  and also by other interested  bodies\r\n\r\nagainst  the  decision  to provide  for  two  separate\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union - one  in  Kuala  Lumpur  and  one   in\r\n\r\nSingapore - instead of allowing for a  single  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  to look after the students in both territories.\r\n\r\nI want to allay the fears of the students that this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naimed  at  splitting the students or is  done  against\r\n\r\ntheir  interest. I want to make it known, in the first\r\n\r\nplace, that the provision for two Divisional Students'\r\n\r\nUnions is a logical consequence of the creation of two\r\n\r\nlargely  autonomous  Divisions,  each  with  its   own\r\n\r\nDivisional Council which will be responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nConstitution   of  the  Students'   Union   in   their\r\n\r\nterritory. Secondly, the provision of two separate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnions  is  really something done in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  students themselves. I am sure that  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  objects of the Students' Union is to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  interests and welfare of their members,  and  who\r\n\r\ncan  look  after them better than their own colleagues\r\n\r\nin the same territory? Also, the Kuala Lumpur Division\r\n\r\nbeing  a  new  division will have fewer students  than\r\n\r\nSingapore   and,  as  such,  should  be  given   every\r\n\r\nopportunity to develop their own Students'  Union.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be  considered that although conditions in  both\r\n\r\nterritories are largely the same, there must be  minor\r\n\r\ndifferences  which  are  best  looked  after  by   the\r\n\r\nstudents  themselves who are on the spot.  I  want  to\r\n\r\nstress  that  the  provision of two  Students'  Unions\r\n\r\nshould not deter the students in both territories, and\r\n\r\nindeed the Union officials themselves, from meeting on\r\n\r\nan ad hoc basis to discuss matters of common interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these few new features of the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya, the old features of the University  remain\r\n\r\nsubstantially the same under the new Constitution  and\r\n\r\nI  am sure that the University will continue as a unit\r\n\r\nto  provide  students  both in Singapore  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  the higher education needed. I  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  creation of these two divisions will require tact\r\n\r\nand  foresight in the administration of the University\r\n\r\nin  future, but I am sure that with goodwill from both\r\n\r\nsides and from the top the future of the University is\r\n\r\nassured. I cannot emphasize too strongly that when the\r\n\r\nUniversity has grown, just as both the Federation  and\r\n\r\nSingapore have grown, something must be done  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  new situation and this Bill now before the  House\r\n\r\nis,  in  the  opinion of both Governments and  in  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the experts who have studied the  problem\r\n\r\nand  made their recommendations, the best way to  meet\r\n\r\nthis new development in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to draw the attention of hon. Members to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the Federation Bill is identically  the\r\n\r\nsame and it was passed in the Federation sometime last\r\n\r\nmonth. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policies that\r\n\r\nhave been pursued by the Federation Government make\r\n\r\nthis Bill the inevitable consequence, and no one is\r\n\r\nalarmed that there will be a University in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. The Minister for Education has wrongly\r\n\r\ninterpreted the fears in the minds of many of the\r\n\r\ngraduates of the University if he thinks that they are\r\n\r\nafraid that the University will be split into two. It\r\n\r\nis well to remember that, with a combined population\r\n\r\nof somewhere in the region of eight to eight and a\r\n\r\nhalf millionth people, Malaya can well afford to have\r\n\r\nmore than three universities - one in Kuala Lumpur and\r\n\r\ntwo in Singapore. But what is in the minds of many of\r\n\r\nthe graduates of the University is that the logical\r\n\r\noutcome of the policies of the two Governments would\r\n\r\nmean that only Singapore students could be in the\r\n\r\nUniversity in Singapore, and only Federation students\r\n\r\ncould go to the University in Kuala Lumpur. Once the\r\n\r\nresources of the University of Singapore - its\r\n\r\nscholarships and its bursaries - are provided for by the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore, it means that the majority\r\n\r\nof, if not all, the students will, in time to come, be\r\n\r\nSingapore students, and the same situation holds true\r\n\r\nwith the students in the University in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one feature of the University of Malaya that was\r\n\r\nprominent  in  all its products, is that  it  was  the\r\n\r\nplace where the intellectuals - the elite - of Malaya  met\r\n\r\non  common  ground.  Be they subsequently  leaders  of\r\n\r\nsocial or political movements in the Federation or  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there is among all these men  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbeing  one. They have gone through the same  mill.  If\r\n\r\nthe  University  of  Singapore and the  University  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  are  to cater not  just  for  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents or for Federation students, but to cater  for\r\n\r\nall  in Malaya, then I say we welcome the creation  of\r\n\r\nmore and more universities, be they in Singapore or in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. But this can only be  if  the  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the  two  Governments,  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nsubsidies  to  the  University  and  its  scholarships\r\n\r\npolicy, are so designed that each Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensures that a sufficient number of its students is in\r\n\r\nthe  other  division. Only in that way  will  the  two\r\n\r\ndivisions of the University - ultimately, I suppose both\r\n\r\nwill   become   full  universities  in   themselves - be\r\n\r\nMalayan.  What  must be avoided is a  situation  where\r\n\r\nthey   become  irreparably  separate,  not   only   in\r\n\r\ngeographical location, but in its student  population.\r\n\r\nIt   is  because  of  this  that  the  students   have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrenuously fought for their right to form one  union.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  because they feel that the Government  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsciously  trying to separate them into two  student\r\n\r\ngroups.  But  if  you  keep the two  students'  unions\r\n\r\nseparate  and,  at  the  same  time,  make  sure  that\r\n\r\nFederation  students go to the Kuala  Lumpur  division\r\n\r\nand  Singapore students go to the Singapore  division,\r\n\r\nthen  you will have a situation where the two  student\r\n\r\npopulations are quite separate and distinct from  each\r\n\r\nother.  I hope that it will not be impossible,  purely\r\n\r\nfrom  the administrative point of view, to ensure that\r\n\r\nboth  the  Singapore and the Federation divisions  are\r\n\r\npan-Malayan, and not provincial divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite\r\n\r\ndisappointed  when the hon. Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the people of this country and this  House\r\n\r\nare  not  alarmed at this Bill. Sir, it is with  mixed\r\n\r\nfeelings, I must admit, of course, not of alarm,  that\r\n\r\nwe  now  debate this Bill. Based on the  size  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  and  the  area, Singapore  and  Malaya  do\r\n\r\nrequire  many more universities, and there  is  reason\r\n\r\nfor having a university in Kuala Lumpur. But we cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  the political fervour and political significance\r\n\r\nthat  are  attached  to this Bill. We  support  higher\r\n\r\neducation  as well as the desirability to  build  more\r\n\r\nuniversities,  but  not at this juncture.  The  merger\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaya is in poor shape, and now\r\n\r\nwe have this Bill and the Causeway clamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must regret that the hon.

We do not  want  this\r\n\r\ndivision.  We do not want this Bill. We prefer  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Singapore  Branch of  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  We  do  not  mind  the  headquarters  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya being in Kuala Lumpur. We do  not\r\n\r\nmind  former  Raffles College or the King  Edward  VII\r\n\r\nCollege  of  Medicine now being called  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBranch  of  the University of Malaya. The significance\r\n\r\nthat  our  people should attach to the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is that it belongs to the Malayans, not  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur Malayans or Singapore Malayans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must confess that the divide and rule tactics\r\n\r\nof  the old colonial regime seem to have succeeded  to\r\n\r\nsome   extent,   and  our  people  are  now   dividing\r\n\r\nthemselves. Even in such a dignified and distinguished\r\n\r\ninstitution  as  the University of  Malaya,  we  allow\r\n\r\nstupid and short-sighted politics to get in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that\r\n\r\nall the people in Malaya and Singapore always consider\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  Malayans. Nobody in  Malaya  has  ever\r\n\r\nthought of Singapore as not being a part of Malaya  or\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a foreign territory. At the present\r\n\r\ntime, Sir, the two Universities are joined together by\r\n\r\na  supreme  Council  governing  the  two  branches.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this is a good thing. It should be a  prelude\r\n\r\nto  the creation of more universities. I hope we shall\r\n\r\nhave   not   only  just  two  Universities  but   more\r\n\r\nuniversities, universities to be situated in the north\r\n\r\nof Malaya, in Kuala Lumpur and in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of South-east Asia, Sir, the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya is an important institution. My hope,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that there will be universities situated all  over\r\n\r\nMalaya, but that the students must come from all parts\r\n\r\nof  the  country, including Singapore.

We must not only  think  of  just\r\n\r\nhaving universities for our own students, but I  think\r\n\r\nit  would be a wise policy to have students from other\r\n\r\ncountries in South-east Asia joining our universities,\r\n\r\nso that our ideals would be well known to all in South-East  Asia.  Not only that, Sir - many of  our  students\r\n\r\nshould go out and join universities in other countries\r\n\r\nand  so get the best from foreign lands, and then come\r\n\r\nback  and serve us, if we can have that, then we  will\r\n\r\nnot be, as the hon.

They will be able to know  what\r\n\r\nis  going  on around them in South-east Asia and  also\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening in the world. If  we  can  achieve\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir,  then I say this Bill, which is  just  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of things to come, will be a good Bill, when\r\n\r\nwe have more universities to help our local boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 am.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chew, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In reply, Sir.

I wish  to  draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of hon. Members to the fact  that  with\r\n\r\nthe  movement of the Engineering Department  to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  - there  is only one Engineering Department  in\r\n\r\nthe two divisions - and the existence of the Faculty  of\r\n\r\nAgriculture in the Federation, that will help  towards\r\n\r\nthat object, that is, help students from Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation mix together. Singapore  students  who\r\n\r\nwant  to  study engineering will have to go  to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,  and  where the Medical Faculty is  concerned,\r\n\r\nFederation students will have to come to Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  their medical studies. We can expect that in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  few  years of the development of the University\r\n\r\nin  Kuala  Lumpur,  the  range  of  subjects  will  be\r\n\r\nincomplete and, as I have said, with the siting of the\r\n\r\nEngineering  Deportment and certain other  studies  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, students will continue to go  from  one\r\n\r\nterritory   to   the  other.  The  present   financial\r\n\r\narrangements between the two Governments are only  for\r\n\r\na  triennial period, and the position will be reviewed\r\n\r\nat the end of 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill itself, Sir, actually caters for all, and\r\r\n\r\nnot, as feared by the hon. Member for Changi, for only\r\n\r\none  section. He said that this is a divide  and  rule\r\n\r\nmatter. Well, I can assure him that it is not so. As I\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out in my speech earlier, the University\r\n\r\nis  not  actually being split, but the  divisions  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  develop themselves. There  is  a  Central\r\n\r\nCouncil, a supreme body, governing at the top, and the\r\n\r\ntwo divisional Councils are given as much autonomy  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Serangoon has said that he\r\n\r\nwelcomes  the  creation of more universities  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  serve the needs of the country. I  wish  to\r\n\r\nsound  a  warning  here: that,  firstly,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider   the   finances  necessary  to   have   more\r\n\r\nuniversities;   secondly,   we   must   relate    that\r\n\r\nrequirements to the needs of the country. We cannot go\r\n\r\non  producing  intellectuals who cannot  be  employed.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they  are  employable, there  might  not  be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient jobs for them. We must temper our needs  in\r\n\r\nthat  respect. I agree, in principle, of course,  that\r\n\r\nwe must expand our university education, but we cannot\r\n\r\nexpand without any limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.

Petrol  uplifted  for  flights\r\n\r\noutside  the  boundaries  of  Singapore,  that  is  for\r\n\r\nscheduled or international flights, is issued  free  of\r\n\r\nduty  under  the  agreement with  the  company  and  by\r\n\r\narrangement  with the Customs and the oil company,  and\r\n\r\nthe question of repayment of duty does not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to item 196 which is in connection with\r\n\r\nthe conversion of a ward at Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  asked  why, with so many cases of tuberculosis\r\n\r\ndisclosed by the recent survey, a ward at Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital   should  be  converted  into  a  hostel   for\r\n\r\nAssistant Nurses. In the first place. Sir, there  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  shortage of Assistant Nurses for  tuberculosis\r\n\r\nwork.  Recruitment  and training is  a  matter  of  top\r\n\r\npriority. Recruitment will be difficult in any case but\r\n\r\ntraining will be impossible unless accommodation can be\r\n\r\nfound   within   the   hospital  compound.   When   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans  for  Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital  were\r\n\r\nimplemented,  perhaps too much emphasis was  placed  on\r\n\r\nward  accommodation due, no doubt,  to  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nstandard plans were available and wards could be  built\r\n\r\nin  groups  with  some ease. As a result,  the  present\r\n\r\nposition  is  that we have adequate ward  accommodation\r\n\r\nbut  no  hostel accommodation to cater for  the  urgent\r\n\r\nneed  for Assistant Nurses. In the circumstances,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  most sensible thing to do is to convert one of the\r\n\r\nexisting  wards,  which is at present standing  vacant,\r\n\r\ninto  a  temporary Nurses Hostel, particularly as  this\r\n\r\ncan  be  done very quickly and at comparatively  little\r\n\r\ncost.  This does not mean, Sir, that we shall be  short\r\n\r\nof  ward accommodation for tuberculosis cases.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, hon. Members will be glad to hear that the\r\n\r\nresults  of the recent survey were much more favourable\r\n\r\nthan  had  been hoped. Only one per cent of  the  cases\r\n\r\nbrought to light require hospitalization.

It is the duty of this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  see  that that  is  done  efficiently,\r\n\r\nquickly, and thoroughly under expert guidance.

Singapore is a small\r\n\r\nplace,  and what is a small experiment in an  isolated\r\n\r\npopulation  becomes  a  national  experiment  and,  in\r\n\r\nconsequence,  extreme caution has to be  exercised  in\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent a calamity arising  however  remote\r\n\r\nthat possibility might be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the reason for this cautious procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we are entirely satisfied that the use of this\r\n\r\nvaccine   is   safe,  we  could  not   implement   the\r\n\r\nimmunization programme.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seriously doubt whether there should be all\r\n\r\nthese  untrained  Press Relations  officers  for  each\r\n\r\nMinistry,  It may be an accurate, honest  and  a  fair\r\n\r\nappraisal  of the medical situation.

Then on the 25th October,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  on the front page: \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...predicted today that the\r\n\r\npresent polio epidemic would die out within a month.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir,  I do not know whether he did. If  he  did,\r\n\r\nthen  he  must  be  a very, very unwise  man,  because\r\n\r\nnobody  knows whether it is going to die out within  a\r\n\r\nmonth  or  not. But there was no denial. Knowing  that\r\n\r\nthe  Press  was already giving his Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\ndifficulties - so much so that he had to say  that  he\r\n\r\nwas  a  very busy man, he could not explain everything\r\n\r\nin  detail over the telephone - why should the  Minister\r\n\r\nopen  himself to such constructions? Immediately after\r\n\r\nthat,  Prof. Hale, the only expert that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  got,  at  the same Press conference, said:  \"Your\r\n\r\nguess is as good as mine.\" Now is not that the kind of\r\n\r\nthing that is calculated to bring the Minister and his\r\n\r\nMinistry   into  ridicule  and  contempt?   Said   Mr\r\n\r\nBraga - this is by way of exculpating his Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We can't give the vaccine at a large number of\r\n\r\ncentres  at  the same time, but we will now  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to run morning and afternoon sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't yet know exactly what the new supply of\r\n\r\nvaccine  will  cost,  but it will be  negligible - apart\r\n\r\nfrom the freight charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have used Salk vaccine for 100,000 children would\r\n\r\nhave  cost $3,000,000 - three injections each at  $10  a\r\n\r\nshot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is  not that stupid, Sir, in the midst of a relatively\r\n\r\nminor polio epidemic - I agree with the Ministry that it\r\n\r\nis  so;  it  has not reached the proportions epidemics\r\n\r\nhave  often  reached  in  places  like  America -   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless in the midst of a situation where parents\r\n\r\nare scared stiff, in a near-panic over their children,\r\n\r\nto  say. \"Ah, well, you know, it is no use using  Salk\r\n\r\nvaccine.  It  costs $10 per shot. Three times  ten  is\r\n\r\n$30. It will cost in all $3-million. Therefore we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  get  something free or at negligible  cost,\r\n\r\napart from freight charges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind the Labour Front Government saying\r\n\r\nstupid  things to bring them to their doom. But  I  do\r\n\r\nmind  Ministers, either through ignorance  or  general\r\n\r\nlackadaisical  attitudes to matters  which  are  their\r\n\r\nconcern, saying things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  exasperate the public, and convince  them  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry, or at least the Minister in charge, is a\r\n\r\nman  guided  by  the  wrong principles,  that  he  was\r\n\r\nprepared to risk the lives of a hundred thousand  kids\r\n\r\nbecause  he  was  going  to save  his  Government  $3-million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, patent medicine pedlars - the people who\r\n\r\nmanufacture  Salk vaccine - canvassed every Assemblyman.\r\n\r\nThey  sent  a  whole  lot  of pamphlets  and  leaflets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough the post, saying: what a wonderful thing  Salk\r\n\r\nvaccine was. If only they could sell $3-million  worth\r\n\r\nof Salk vaccine! I am told that it actually costs only\r\n\r\na  dollar per tube and three shots will cost $3. So if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  thought he was going to pay  $3-million\r\n\r\nfor  it, they might be able to sell it to him for  $2-million  and  make a lot of money out of it!  But  the\r\n\r\nstupidity of the statement, to which, of course, quite\r\n\r\nrightly the Straits Times gave considerable prominence\r\n\r\non its front page, is enough to have sent any group of\r\n\r\nintelligent  parents into a rage. What  I  am  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment amazed at is the calm and the resignation  with\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  had to put up in the  face  of  the\r\n\r\nincompetence  with which this whole problem  has  been\r\n\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is what Professor Hale said - I do not doubt\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  a  polio expert and  that  he  has  been\r\n\r\ninvestigating the use of the attenuated form of  virus\r\n\r\nin  the  Sabin vaccine - but was this likely  to  induce\r\n\r\npublic confidence? At the same conference he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is estimated that the new supply will be used up\r\n\r\nwithin five weeks, but Prof. Hale, who is scheduled to\r\n\r\nleave  here  permanently in December, said  he  would\r\n\r\nremain to see the job through.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  that  is very kind of him, and quite proper.

If the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  a Public Relations Department which knew its job,\r\n\r\nit  would have told the Minister and his experts that,\r\n\r\nhowever true that statement might have been, it is one\r\n\r\nwhich  was  misconceived  and  calculated  to  destroy\r\n\r\npublic  confidence.  But,  having  gone  to  all  this\r\n\r\ntrouble to explain why Sabin vaccine should be used in\r\n\r\nan  endemic area in the face of a rising epidemic - I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether this is the Straits  Times  or  Dr\r\n\r\nDoraisingham - but it said here, right at the end of  it\r\n\r\nall \"European victim\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The European boy aged 13 from Serangoon Gardens was\r\n\r\nadmitted to the R.A.F.

But knowing full well from the\r\n\r\nvery  beginning  that  the Press  was  making  this  a\r\n\r\npopular  issue and was selling the story, it  was  the\r\n\r\nstupidest  thing  in the world to have  allowed  three\r\n\r\nspokesmen at any one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  there was one expert, then only that expert should\r\n\r\nhave  expressed his opinion. But to have three persons\r\n\r\nto  attend  the Press conference - one of whom  was  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  head (a person renowned for his  hunting.\r\n\r\nshooting   and   riding  activities,  not   including,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  the hunting of the  polio  virus)  who\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was going to end in one month, and  then\r\n\r\nbeing properly contradicted by his polio expert, Prof.\r\n\r\nHale,   and   having  his  spokesman,  his   Permanent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary,  to add that the polio could strike  anyone\r\n\r\nwithout active immunisation. Was it necessary or wise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope it is not asking too much of the Minister\r\n\r\nbefore he leaves the day after tomorrow for Japan,  to\r\n\r\ntake  some  steps to make sure: first, that the  Sabin\r\n\r\nvaccine is rapidly and effectively distributed to  all\r\n\r\nwho   require  it  in  Singapore.  This  is   a   pure\r\n\r\nadministrative   problem  which   can   be   overcome.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if there is any doubt in the matter at  all,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  expert  team  should be asked to come,  study  and\r\n\r\nsupervise  the  use of this vaccine.  Sir,  when  this\r\n\r\narticle  was  written  about  the  Sabinisation  of  a\r\n\r\nquarter million people in the Belgian Congo, it  might\r\n\r\ninterest the Minister to know that there were no  less\r\n\r\nthan  five  M.Ds.,  all persons of great  professional\r\n\r\nstanding - Directors  of  Laboratories  in  the  Belgian\r\n\r\nCongo  and  the U.S.A. and other research institutions\r\n\r\n(I  may refer, for his easy reference, to page 187  of the  British  Medical Journal dated 26th July) - leading\r\n\r\nthe whole expert team to conduct tests. I would not be\r\n\r\nunreasonable  if  I  suggested  to  him  that,  having\r\n\r\nalready  embarked on a nation-wide vaccination process\r\n\r\nwhich we all hope will be thoroughly successful, there\r\n\r\nis  no  harm in getting an expert team to see the  job\r\n\r\nthrough.  In  the meantime he should stop  talking  in\r\n\r\nthree  voices. I know there is one school  of  thought\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very unkind to the Minister when  it  says,\r\n\r\n\"Ah,  well, anyway, thank God, he is not here to  make\r\n\r\nmatters worse.\" I am hoping that, before he goes away,\r\n\r\nhe will try and do something to see that the machinery\r\n\r\nruns smoothly and effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting, for one moment, that we\r\n\r\nshould  be other than democratic in our dealings  with\r\n\r\nthe  Press.  But  I say this: that the Government  has\r\n\r\nconsiderable powers of persuasion to bring them  round\r\n\r\nto  see  that the selling of a story is less important\r\n\r\nthan  public morale, peace and tranquillity.  To  have\r\n\r\nallowed  themselves  to  get  caught  up  in  a  Press\r\n\r\nhysteria  which has led to such a state that you  find\r\n\r\nthe  vaccination centres besieger by  very  angry  and\r\n\r\nvery excited parents shows: (1) either the Minister is\r\n\r\nincapable  of using his persuasive powers, or  (2)  he\r\n\r\ndoes not understand that a great deal of harm has been\r\n\r\ndone to public confidence as a result of all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to this. I am not asking the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health to discover a cure for polio  when\r\n\r\nthe rest of the world have not gone further than Prof.\r\n\r\nSabin and Prof. Salk, but I am asking him, even though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have not got the cure, we should at least  try  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a situation where everybody is in a state  of\r\n\r\nanxiety.  Every  parent  who  has  a  child   in   the\r\n\r\nvulnerable  age  group  is in a  state  of  fright - not\r\n\r\nbecause  there  have not been polio epidemics  before,\r\n\r\nthere  would  have been some anxiety anyway, but  the\r\n\r\npresentation  of  the  work of the  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  led  to  a  general  loss  of   public\r\n\r\nconfidence  and the spread of alarm. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  in this Assembly that it is our duty to check it:\r\n\r\n(1)  to  ask the Press not to aggravate the situation,\r\n\r\nand (2) to ask the Minister to get on with the job. He\r\n\r\nhas  decided  on Sabin. He has had his expert  advice.\r\n\r\nNow is not the time to start an argument whether Sabin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have been used or should not have  been  used,\r\n\r\nbecause all the experts are agreed that once you start\r\n\r\nSabin, you Sabinise everybody who requires it.  It  is\r\n\r\nhis  duty to do that, otherwise he will have the wrath\r\n\r\nof more than the parents of a hundred thousand kids on\r\n\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House deplores the inept and incompetent\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  the Minister  for  Health  and  his\r\n\r\nMinistry have dealt with the current polio epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Minister for Health is more at\r\n\r\nhome  hunting big game in East Africa and fishing  for\r\n\r\nsmall fish in local waters than he is in hunting  down\r\n\r\nthe  virus responsible for the present polio epidemic.\r\n\r\nSir,  as a fisherman, he is even known to have  fished\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  distinguished  company for very  small  fish  from\r\n\r\nmilitary  helicopters, and the excitement  of  such  a\r\n\r\nnovel method of fishing has caused him to become  less\r\n\r\nand  less aware of the afflictions of ordinary mortals\r\n\r\nlike ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They\r\n\r\ndo  so  in  the mistaken belief that he has  dedicated\r\n\r\nhimself  to  the  destruction of  the  microbes  which\r\n\r\nafflict human society. But unfortunately for us,  this\r\n\r\nis  a sport in which the Minister for Health has shown\r\n\r\nvery little interest. It is not surprising, therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  to find the Minister suddenly jolted into action\r\n\r\nby  exaggerated reports appearing in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nabout  the extent of the polio epidemic. One does  not\r\n\r\nhave  to be associated with the Ministry of Health  to\r\n\r\nknow  that the administration of drugs which have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  offered  for public sale should  be  done  under\r\n\r\nexperts supervision. It is now his duty, Sir,  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  this is done. The way in which he has dealt with\r\n\r\nthis  outbreak  of  polio epidemic  has  confused  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public. As a member of the public, and  as  an\r\n\r\nelected  representative of the people, I must register\r\n\r\na  strong  protest at the deplorable way in which  the\r\n\r\nMinister has dealt with the present polio outbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my leader has wished the Minister for Health bon\r\n\r\nvoyage  on  his departure for Japan on Friday.

Member for Tanjong Pagar  has\r\n\r\nforced  me  to  hold my horses until  this  debate.  I\r\n\r\npropose  now,  Sir, to give a full statement  on  this\r\n\r\nwhole  matter and that statement will cover the points\r\n\r\nwhich  have been raised by the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar, who has a flair for playing to the gallery  and\r\n\r\nmaking   political  capital  out  of  other   people's\r\n\r\nsuffering for the benefit of his Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, Sir, the only way in which some\r\n\r\nprecautions  could be taken against poliomyelitis  was\r\n\r\nby  giving  standard advice. Until actively immunising\r\n\r\nvaccines  were produced, the measures applied  to  the\r\n\r\ndisease  are given in the Report entitled the \"Control\r\n\r\nof  Communicable  Diseases in  Man\"  published  as  an\r\n\r\nofficial   report  of  the  American   Public   Health\r\n\r\nAssociation.   That  report  from  the   \"Control   of\r\n\r\nCommunicable Diseases in Man\" published  in  1955  has\r\n\r\nthis note - \"that the substance of this Report has been\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the Ministry of Health for  England  and\r\n\r\nWales  and the Department of Health for Scotland  with\r\n\r\ncertain reservations to meet international commitments\r\n\r\nand  agreements  and  differences in  legislative  and\r\n\r\nadministrative practice in Great Britain.\"  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose  to  burden Members with a detailed  technical\r\n\r\ndiscussion. Suffice it to say that the standard advice\r\n\r\ngiven  there has been repeated continually by  members\r\n\r\nof my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry and by myself over Radio Malaya. We asked the\r\n\r\npeople  to  see that children wash their hands  before\r\n\r\nand after meals and keep away from swimming pools, and\r\n\r\nso  forth. But perhaps I might read one or two of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  recommended  in this  report  at  page  136;\r\n\r\nEpidemic measures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Protection of children so far as practical against\r\n\r\nunnecessary   close   contact  with   other   persons,\r\n\r\nespecially  with  other  family  groups  or  outsiders\r\n\r\nduring  epidemic  prevalence  of  the  disease.  Urban\r\n\r\nschools should not be closed nor opening delayed,  but\r\n\r\nintensive or competitive athletic programmes should be\r\n\r\npostponed...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, our health officers, sanitary\r\n\r\ninspectors, health visitors and other staff have  been\r\n\r\nactively  engaged in advising householders. Everything\r\n\r\npossible  to  impress on the minds of the  people  the\r\n\r\nneed for taking these elementary precautions was made,\r\n\r\nshort  of  addressing  each and every  householder  by\r\n\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until immunising vaccines became available, such\r\n\r\nadvice  could  only  be given. Without  vaccines,  the\r\n\r\nmedical  profession  was,  in  fact,  helpless.   Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  may  be  interested  to  know  that  even  in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries  where  sanitary  conscience  and   sanitary\r\n\r\ndiscipline  are highly developed and where people  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  observe  the  advice  given  almost   with\r\n\r\nreligious  fervour, particularly in  the  face  of  an\r\n\r\nepidemic, epidemic visitations have recurred. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  quote  from  the Epidemiological  and  Vital\r\n\r\nStatistics   Report  prepared  by  the  World   Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  Sir, Volume II No. 7 of  1958,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the visitation of polio in other countries\r\n\r\nas late as 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States in 1951 there were 28,386 cases\r\n\r\nwith  1,551 deaths - this was not taken over the  whole\r\n\r\narea  but in the areas where polio had struck. In 1952\r\n\r\nthere  were 57,879 cases with 3,145 deaths;  in  1954,\r\n\r\n38,476  cases with 1,368 deaths; in 1956, 15,140  with\r\n\r\nunknown deaths (this is when the vaccine began  to  be\r\n\r\nused);  and  in  1957,  5,903  cases.  In  most  other\r\n\r\ncountries  such as the United Kingdom, Italy,  France,\r\n\r\nSweden, Australia, the pattern of prevalence has  been\r\n\r\nsimilar.  All the advice, however, does not appear  to\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretarded  in  the  least  the  tragic  succession   of\r\n\r\nperiodic  outbreaks. In England in  1951,  there  were\r\n\r\n2,614  cases, and in 1955 6,153. I am saying all  this\r\n\r\njust to show that in the absence of immunising agents,\r\n\r\nthe   medical   profession  is   helpless.   All   the\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures taken were palliatives, both in\r\n\r\napology  for  our  helplessness  and  to  appear  that\r\n\r\nsomething  is being done, however futile  it  may  be.\r\n\r\nWhen   the  first  few  cases  of  poliomyelitis  were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotified in late September this year, criticisms  were\r\n\r\nlevelled  at my Ministry as to why active immunisation\r\n\r\nwas not carried out in order to prevent the occurrence\r\n\r\nof such an outbreak as we now have in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a short statement of the\r\n\r\nvisitation of polio in Singapore. In 1946, there  were\r\n\r\n237  cases with an unknown number of deaths; in  1948,\r\n\r\nthere  were  over 200 cases with 21 deaths;  and  then\r\n\r\nthere was a steady prevalence. In 1949, there were  76\r\n\r\ncases with 2 deaths; in 1950, 82 cases with 10 deaths;\r\n\r\nin  1951,  81 cases with 9 deaths; in 1952,  55  cases\r\n\r\nwith  10  deaths; in 1953, 43 cases with 5 deaths;  in\r\n\r\n1954, 71 cases with 3 deaths; in 1955, 24 cases with 2\r\n\r\ndeaths,  and then there was an outbreak in early  1957\r\n\r\nof well over 100 cases with 7 deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures today, Sir, from an analysis which I have\r\n\r\ngot  here  of  cases from August to  October,  are  in\r\n\r\nAugust 6 cases, September 32 cases, October 168 cases,\r\n\r\nand up to 4.30 p.m. yesterday, 26 cases. I have got\r\n\r\nthe  breakdown figures, if any Members are interested,\r\n\r\nthe nationality and sex of the victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, poliomyelitis in man, Sir, is essentially an\r\n\r\ninfection of the gut - the alimentary tract in which the\r\n\r\nvirus  multiplies. In a very small percentage of cases\r\n\r\nthe virus enters the blood stream and subsequently, in\r\n\r\na  relatively few cases, may invade the nervous system\r\n\r\nresulting in paralysis. An infection with polio  virus\r\n\r\ndoes two things. Firstly, the gut becomes resistant to\r\n\r\nattack.   Secondly,  it  produces   antibodies   which\r\n\r\ncirculate  in the blood stream and so neutralises  the\r\n\r\nvirus that may invade the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the statements which I made over Radio Malaya\r\n\r\nand  in the Press, hon. Members are no doubt aware  by\r\n\r\nnow  that  there are two types of vaccines  available.\r\n\r\nOne  the  killed vaccine, which is the Salk,  and  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  a  live vaccine, such as the Sabin. The disease\r\n\r\npoliomyelitis is now known to be caused by three types\r\n\r\nof  virus,  and to effectively immunise a person  with\r\n\r\nthe killed vaccine such as Salk, three doses are given\r\n\r\nby  way  of injections at stated intervals, the  first\r\n\r\ntaking  6  weeks to be effective, and  the  last  dose\r\n\r\nbeing given 7 months after the second dose. When  this\r\n\r\nis  done  the body reacts to the vaccine and  produces\r\n\r\nantibodies which circulate in the blood. It does  not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  prevent the infection of the gut by virulent\r\n\r\norganisms  nor protects any one who may be  incubating\r\n\r\nthe   disease   within  this  period.  Salk   vaccine,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  provided all the three  inoculations  have\r\n\r\nbeen given, acts as a barrier against the invasion  of\r\n\r\nthe nervous system by the virus and so would prevent a\r\n\r\nparalytic  attack.  Recent  evidence  shows  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal  figure of 70 per cent protection of  persons\r\n\r\nso  inoculated is incorrect and is found  to  be  very\r\n\r\nmuch less. There is one thing certain that it does not\r\n\r\ndo, and that is, it does not prevent the infection  of\r\n\r\nthe   gut   and,  therefore,  does  not  prevent   the\r\n\r\ninoculated person excreting the virulent virus and  so\r\n\r\ncause  disease amongst the non-immune. To be effective\r\n\r\nas  an anti-epidemic measure, the inoculation must  be\r\n\r\ncarried out on a very substantial scale and within  as\r\n\r\nshort  a time as possible. By the importation of large\r\n\r\nquantities  of  the  vaccine  which  has  only  become\r\n\r\navailable recently, and by employing large numbers  of\r\n\r\npersons  to  carry  out  the  inoculations,   and   at\r\n\r\ntremendous expense, involving several million dollars,\r\n\r\nit  is  theoretically  possible to  immunise  a  large\r\n\r\npercentage   of   the  population  temporarily.   Such\r\n\r\nvaccine,  however,  does  not  stop  an  epidemic   in\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read the World Health Organisation\r\n\r\nTechnical  Report  of 1958 - this is the  World  Health\r\n\r\nExpert Committee on polio - and I am reading at page 8:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In July 1956, during a period of rising incidence,\r\n\r\nthe   Chicago  Board  of  Health  initiated   a   mass\r\n\r\nvaccination  programme in which 1,750,000  doses  were\r\n\r\ninjected  in less than two months. However, there  was\r\n\r\nno demonstrable effect as to dampening the epidemic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members of this House are aware how Government\r\n\r\nhas  been pleading with parents in the rural areas  to\r\n\r\nbring  their  children forward to  receive  protective\r\n\r\ninoculation  against  a far more dangerous  and  fatal\r\n\r\ndisease  than poliomyelitis, namely, diphtheria.  This\r\n\r\nhas  received  some success after prolonged  sustained\r\n\r\nappeals.  The  response has been  poor  in  the  city,\r\n\r\npossibly  because  it  involves  injections,  and  two\r\n\r\nvisits  must  be paid. Immunisation with Salk  vaccine\r\n\r\ninvolves three painful inoculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ideal immunising agent for Singapore, therefore,\r\n\r\nis  one that should effectively protect the population\r\n\r\nagainst  disease  and, more important,  one  that  the\r\n\r\npopulation will readily accept. An even more important\r\n\r\nconsideration is that the vaccine should  be  safe  to\r\n\r\nuse,  and  I repeat that, Sir, \"the vaccine should  be\r\n\r\nsafe  to  use\". If there happens to be a vaccine  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  require  a  syringe  with  its  threatening\r\n\r\nneedle,  if  there  is one which is  pleasing  to  the\r\n\r\nchildren  taking  it, if there is one  which  at  once\r\n\r\nproduces  full  resistance to invasion  by  the  polio\r\n\r\nvirus and further produces neutralising antibodies  in\r\n\r\nblood  stream and it is at the same time safe to  use,\r\n\r\nthis vaccine would be the vaccine of choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much research has been carried out in this direction\r\n\r\nand,   as   is  usual,  experimental  work  has   been\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  regard  to  various  types   of   live\r\n\r\nvaccines. Live vaccines will have the virtue of  being\r\n\r\nadministered  by the mouth, of effectively  immunising\r\n\r\nthe  gut  and  of producing antibodies  in  the  blood\r\n\r\nstream.  The  problem  has been  to  develop  a  virus\r\n\r\nconsiderably    weakened,   I   repeat,   considerably\r\n\r\nweakened, yet possessing full immunising properties so\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  not  cause the disease  in  the  most\r\n\r\nsensitive  of animals - animals far more sensitive  than\r\n\r\nman is - when injected directly into the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, the co-ordinated series of\r\n\r\nexperiments were interrupted by an experiment  on  man\r\n\r\nin Belfast with a strain of virus prepared in 1956 and\r\n\r\nthe  methods  used  did  not comply  with  the  strict\r\n\r\nstandards  set by the World Health Organisation.  When\r\n\r\nlive  vaccine  is  being  given  by  the  mouth,   the\r\n\r\nattenuated virus infects the gut, multiplies  therein,\r\n\r\nas  does a natural infection, and are excreted in  the\r\n\r\nstools.   It  so  happened  that  in  this  particular\r\n\r\nexperiment in Belfast, the outgoing virus in a  number\r\n\r\nof  cases  reverted  to full virulence.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nvirulence acquired through passage, and the experiment\r\n\r\nwas  found  dangerous and called off. That  experiment\r\n\r\nproduced  a real scare. It was widely publicised,  and\r\n\r\nthe  medical profession certainly and some members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public are aware of this experiment. The  dangers\r\n\r\ninherent  in the experiment in Belfast did  not  deter\r\n\r\nresearch  which continued, and it is now  possible  to\r\n\r\nproduce a live vaccine like the Sabin that would  both\r\n\r\nbe  safe  and would prevent the gut from such  further\r\n\r\ninvasion  of the virus and, at the same time,  produce\r\n\r\nantibodies  in  the  blood stream, and  when  excreted\r\n\r\nwould not revert to virulence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in 1956, a batch of over 10,000 doses of a\r\n\r\nhighly  attenuated vaccine produced by Professor  A.B.\r\n\r\nSabin,  and  which  conforms  with  the  World  Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganisation  Expert Committee's rigid standards,  was\r\n\r\nsent   to   Professor   J.  H.  Hale,   Professor   of\r\n\r\nBacteriology  of the University of Malaya,  for  field\r\n\r\ntrials.  Professor Hale carried out experiments  among\r\n\r\nEuropean  and other volunteers with this vaccine,  and\r\n\r\nover a considerable period of time, in order to assess\r\n\r\nits  safety,  watching carefully to  see  whether  any\r\n\r\nvirulent virus would be excreted. Simultaneously  also\r\n\r\nin  other  countries experimental research  with  this\r\n\r\ntype of vaccine was undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, the World Health Organisation\r\n\r\nhad  appointed an Expert Committee comprising  eminent\r\n\r\nvirologists from twelve different countries to further\r\n\r\nstudy  the  problem of poliomyelitis and  the  use  of\r\n\r\nvaccine.  Now  the  members of  that  Conference  were\r\n\r\nIsrael,  Australia,  Scotland, Sweden,  South  Africa,\r\n\r\nSingapore (Professor Hale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattended),  Japan,  Canada,  United  States,   France,\r\n\r\nPoland  and  Russia. They sat in Geneva from  15th  to\r\n\r\n20th July, 1957. The Report was published in 1958  and\r\n\r\nthat  Committee's Report was received by this Ministry\r\n\r\non   the  13th  of  August  this  year.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nimmediately  entered into discussions  with  Professor\r\n\r\nHale,  who  was  a  member of that  Expert  Committee,\r\n\r\nregarding  the  cautious statements contained  in  the\r\n\r\nReport, but the discourse appearing on page 24 of  the\r\n\r\nReport   shows  that  studies  with  the  most  highly\r\n\r\nattenuated strains, one of which is Sabin, showed that\r\n\r\nthe  excreted  virus was harmless even when  injected\r\n\r\ndirectly into the spinal cord of the most sensitive of\r\n\r\nanimals - animals  more  sensitive  than   man   is   to\r\n\r\npoliomyelitis. The Committee itself was  so  convinced\r\n\r\nof  its  safety  and  efficacy that  it  made  certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations which I will read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I, at this moment, interrupt\r\n\r\nto move a business motion, because I doubt whether the\r\n\r\nHon.

Braga:</b> I was saying, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Experts was so convinced of the safety of\r\n\r\nthe  Sabin  vaccine that it also made recommendations,\r\n\r\nwhich I am now reading from page 25:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"After careful consideration of the data at present\r\n\r\navailable on the use of live attenuated polio  viruses\r\n\r\nas   immunising  agents  against  poliomyelitis,   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  strongly recommends that  controlled  field\r\n\r\ntrials  be  carried  out for the  purpose  of  testing\r\n\r\nfurther the value\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>not the safety, which has already been established,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"of  these agents. It recommends that these trials  be\r\n\r\ndone   in   special  situations  and   under   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances which are listed in more detail below\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and the special situations which the Committee believe\r\n\r\nwill  lend themselves to this type of trial,  are;  in\r\n\r\nthe face of an impending epidemic, or at the periphery\r\n\r\nof  an  already existing epidemic; where poliomyelitis\r\n\r\nof  the  infantile type is endemic, and in particular,\r\n\r\nwithin  those areas where signs are indicative  of  an\r\n\r\nimminent shift to the epidemic form of the disease  to\r\n\r\nreinforce  the  immunity  previously  produced  by  an\r\n\r\ninactivated  virus vaccine. Now, Sir,  the  Committee\r\n\r\nhas  recommended that large scale field trials  should\r\n\r\nnow  be carried out, basing its considerations on  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  available  up  to  July  1957.  This   was,\r\n\r\nhowever, not the only evidence upon which I relied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from the Annual Report of the\r\n\r\nNational Poliomyelitis Foundation covering the  period\r\n\r\nJuly 1957 to 30th June, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Three tests were carried out, one by Professor J. D.\r\n\r\nVerlinde of the University of Leiden, Holland,  on  170\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  and adults in families of Faculty members  of\r\n\r\nthe  University. Next by Dr M. Ramos-Alvarez of Mexico\r\n\r\nCity  on  the detailed study of 3,000 children under  8\r\n\r\nyears  of age, and also by Professor A. A. Smorodintsev\r\n\r\nof   the   Institute   of  Experimental   Medicine   in\r\n\r\nLeningrad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are cited in the Annual Report of the National\r\n\r\nPoliomyelitis  Foundation, at  page  8.  In  the  last-\r\n\r\nmentioned  field trials, the Russian professor  carried\r\n\r\nout five or more serial passages. He cultured the virus\r\n\r\nexcreted  from the first batch of children and injected\r\n\r\nthem  into  the  spinal  cord of monkeys.  The  monkeys\r\n\r\nshowed  no  evidence of paralytic attack. Then  he  fed\r\n\r\nthat  culture  to  a  further  batch  of  children  and\r\n\r\nrepeated  consecutively five times or  more,  and  this\r\n\r\nexperiment  was  carried  out on  3,000  children.  The\r\n\r\nefficacy  and  safety thus shown by Sabin vaccine  have\r\n\r\nresulted  now in the Russians feeding 200,000  children\r\n\r\nwith  the Sabin vaccine as a preliminary canter. Mexico\r\n\r\nis trying on 200,000 doses, and Czechoslovakia 200,000,\r\n\r\nand the reason why the 100,000 doses now being used  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are still under expert control, is largely to\r\n\r\ncomply  with the request of Professor Sabin  with  whom\r\n\r\nProfessor  Hale  has  been in constant  touch,  and  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate to those who have doubts that  it  is  both\r\n\r\nsafe and efficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a country as large as many others.\r\n\r\nIn  such  countries it is possible to test the  vaccine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  amongst restricted communities without fear of it,\r\n\r\nif  it is proved to be dangerous, spreading to the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  community. Any disastrous experiment  of  this\r\n\r\nnature  in  a  small place like ours  may  involve  the\r\n\r\nentire  nation. That is the main reason  why  prolonged\r\n\r\nstudies  had to be carried out in Singapore  and  await\r\n\r\nthe results of studies elsewhere until we are satisfied\r\n\r\nthat it is safe to use it. It is of interest to Members\r\n\r\nto  note that the tests conducted by Professor Hale  on\r\n\r\n50  to 60 persons specifically for giving immunity  and\r\n\r\nthe assessment of safety showed that the virus excreted\r\n\r\nin all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases were no more virulent than the weak virus put in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At or about the time that Professor Hale was\r\n\r\nconducting his tests, many other matters were  engaging\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Ministry, such as the  prevention\r\n\r\nof  the  spread  of  diphtheria, the  anti-tuberculosis\r\n\r\ncampaign  and,  in particular, the cholera  problem  in\r\n\r\nThailand, the prevention of entry of which engaged  the\r\n\r\nfull  attention of the Ministry. Hon. Members are aware\r\n\r\nof the success of these concrete actions. Singapore had\r\n\r\nnot  been visited by an outbreak of poliomyelitis since\r\n\r\nJanuary 1957. Outbreaks usually occur every 2\u00bd  to  3\r\n\r\nyears,  but  let me assure Members that when  cases  of\r\n\r\npoliomyelitis  were being notified  in  September,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry recognised the urgency of a decision regarding\r\n\r\nthe  safety  of mass use of live vaccine in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  recommendations of the Report. The  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsulted  the  Federation  Health  Authority  and  the\r\n\r\nServices  to  study  the problem. An  Expert  Committee\r\n\r\ncomprising the following studied the problem:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Medical Services, Singapore; the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director  of Medical Services,  Singapore;  the\r\n\r\nAssistant   Director  of  Medical  Services   (Health),\r\n\r\nSingapore; the Director of Medical Services, Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya; the Virologist of the Institute for Medical\r\n\r\nResearch,  Kuala  Lumpur;  the  Assistant  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical   Services,   Singapore  Base   District;   the\r\n\r\nAssistant    Director   of   Pathology,   F.A.R.E.L.F.;\r\n\r\nProfessor J.

I immediately consulted\r\n\r\nProfessor  Hale  who had been conducting  satisfactory\r\n\r\ntests and the Director of Medical Services, Singapore,\r\n\r\nafter  which  we  authorised mass inoculation  and  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the specific directive  of  Professor\r\n\r\nSabin  given to Professor Hale that the campaign  must\r\n\r\nbe  done under his, supervision. Further supplies were\r\n\r\nimmediately  asked for. This decision was  in  no  way\r\n\r\nprecipitated by articles appearing in the Press or, in\r\n\r\nfact,  by  any  suggested pressure. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nrepeat that, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given the history of the decision right up to\r\n\r\nthe time of the decision of the release of the vaccine\r\n\r\nand  I  can assure you, Sir, and Members of this House\r\n\r\nthat it was not precipitated by any articles that  may\r\n\r\nhave  appeared  in the Press or by any  pressure.  The\r\n\r\nsituation was ideal to use Sabin vaccine and to  prove\r\n\r\nto  doubting  Thomases  the  efficacy  and  safety  as\r\n\r\nrecommended by the World Health Organisation  and  the\r\n\r\npolio  experts  so  that in future  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth can authorise mass inoculation as routine. Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers know that 100,000 doses have been received and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  being administered in various centres. The  virus\r\n\r\nnow  affecting the people of Singapore - and  I  am  now\r\n\r\ngiving  this as a matter of information to  all  those\r\n\r\ninterested - is  Type 1 virus. The virus used  in  Sabin\r\n\r\nvaccine  is  Type  2,  but  evidence  has  shown  that\r\n\r\ninfection by Type 2 virus blocks the gut not only from\r\n\r\ninfection  of  Type 2 virus permanently,  but  against\r\n\r\nTypes  1 and 3 for a considerable time, and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nno  Type  1 virus can affect anybody who is inoculated\r\n\r\nwith  Type  2  for a considerable time. Type  2  virus\r\n\r\ncannot  at any time produce a Type 1 epidemic. Perhaps\r\n\r\nI  should  read  some  of  the telegrams  that  passed\r\n\r\nbetween  my  Ministry, Professor Sabin  and  Professor\r\n\r\nHale.  A  telegram had already been sent by  Professor\r\n\r\nHale,  but my Ministry did not hear anything,  and  so\r\n\r\nsent a cable on 21st\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober  to Professor Sabin of the Children's Hospital\r\n\r\nResearch Foundation, Cincinnati:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Further to Professor Hale's cable this Government\r\n\r\nwould  appreciate one hundred thousand doses  of  your\r\n\r\nattenuated vaccine stop Will meet costs\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Sabin then cabled to Professor Hale in a\r\n\r\ntelegram which I will now read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Pending receipt your letter can ship vaccine\r\n\r\nimmediately   after  I  know  plans   for   use   stop\r\n\r\nResponsible   investigators  stop   Arrangements   for\r\n\r\nclinical  and  laboratory surveillance stop  Regarding\r\n\r\nadministration during epidemic would agree only to use\r\n\r\nof  Type two vaccine if prevalent viruses are Type one\r\n\r\nor three - Sabin\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we sent this cable after having consulted\r\n\r\nProfessor Hale on the 22nd October to Professor Sabin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Epidemic due entirely to Type one stop Investigation\r\n\r\nand  administration of vaccine in hands  of  Professor\r\n\r\nHale  stop  Children three months to ten  years  being\r\n\r\ngiven  Type two oral vaccine stop Four thousand  doses\r\n\r\nalready   administered   stop   Investigations    stop\r\n\r\nProportion of excreted virus tested pathogenicity stop\r\n\r\nVirus isolation and typing is carried out on all cases\r\n\r\nof   poliomyelitis  stop  Please  assist  one  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand doses air freight vaccine as soon as possible\r\n\r\nstop\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have got the final cable on the 23rd October:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Shipping one hundred thousand doses Type two oral\r\n\r\npolio  vaccine on PAA Flight eightthree  one  arriving\r\n\r\nSingapore October twenty-seventh - Sabin\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions may have been asked, Sir, why the vaccine\r\n\r\noriginally   had  to  be  administered  at   the   two\r\n\r\nclinics - at Lim Ah Pin Road Clinic and the Yio Chu Kang\r\n\r\nRoad Clinic. The vaccine which Professor Hale received\r\n\r\nfrom  Professor Sabin was specially for  his  personal\r\n\r\nuse   in   field   trials  and  naturally   would   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient for the purposes of an immediate national\r\n\r\nimmunisation  programme. There  was,  therefore,  very\r\n\r\ngreat need to limit the numbers. Also, apart from  the\r\n\r\ncity,  most of the prevalence was in the areas  served\r\n\r\nby  these  two  clinics.  Until  large  stocks  became\r\n\r\navailable,  the  city could not  be  handled  and  the\r\n\r\nlogical  areas  would  be  those  two  districts.

We are negotiating\r\n\r\nto  retain  Professor Hale who is  due  to  leave  in\r\n\r\nDecember  this  year  until this  epidemic  is  over.\r\n\r\nSubsequent  administration of the  oral  vaccine  can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen be a routine measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it was suggested that the\r\n\r\nSabin vaccine is still in its experimental stage, but\r\n\r\nit  must be remembered that any vaccine is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nstill  in an experimental stage. The Salk vaccine  is\r\n\r\nstill  in its experimental stage, and there  is  much\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction as to its efficacy, so much so that a\r\n\r\nfourth  injection is now advocated, and I  would  now\r\n\r\nlike  to read from Medical News, which is a newspaper\r\n\r\nfor  physicians, dated 6th October, 1958.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nAmerican paper from Washington:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A nation-wide increase in paralytic polio\r\n\r\nincidence   with  the  upswing  taking  on   epidemic\r\n\r\nproportions in the Detroit area is adding  weight  to\r\n\r\nthe  arguments  of those who advocate a  fourth  Salk\r\n\r\nshot.  Some  11 deaths in 162 paralytic  polio  cases\r\n\r\nhave  been  reported so far this year among Americans\r\n\r\nwho  received three shots of Salk vaccine. Under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the Public Health Service  said  here\r\n\r\nthat  physicians  may  want  to  recommend  a  fourth\r\n\r\ninjection to give their patients the maximum possible\r\n\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now the Public Health Service authorities added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Waning immunity could not be ruled out as one\r\n\r\npossible factor in the development of paralytic polio\r\n\r\namong  triply  inoculated persons  since  many  cases\r\n\r\ndeveloped   more   than  a  year  after   the   third\r\n\r\ninjection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the Sabin vaccine, Sir, can be seen\r\n\r\nin   a  personal  letter  from  Professor  Sabin   to\r\n\r\nProfessor  Hale - I am reading from the  original - dated\r\n\r\n22nd October:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dear James,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in receipt of the telegrams from yourself and\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministry of Health that were sent to me  on\r\n\r\nOctober 21st and the one from the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nsent on October\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22nd in reply to the one that I had sent the day\r\n\r\nbefore.

It must be remembered that Professor\r\n\r\nHale has to keep this vaccine at a certain temperature\r\n\r\nand there are certain technical matters involved of\r\n\r\nwhich I am ignorant. The vaccine has to be made up,\r\n\r\nsent out every morning and returned to him.

Personally, Sir, as a father and a  grandfather\r\n\r\nof  many  children and grandchildren, the  first  thing\r\n\r\nwhen  I take up the paper every morning is to find  out\r\n\r\nwhat  the position is about this polio epidemic.  There\r\n\r\nare  thousands  of parents in Singapore  who  might  be\r\n\r\ndoing   the   same  thing  every  morning  and   worry.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe in fatalism, but after taking all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe necessary precautions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public of Singapore should have protection\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government.

Today  the  parents  are  living  in  the\r\n\r\ngreatest fear - what will happen next? it is my fear and\r\n\r\nit  is everybody's fear. If it comes to a vote on  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  I will, of course, abstain, because I  am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to make political capital out of it. This motion\r\n\r\nis  rather  late in deploring, because this  Government\r\n\r\nhas been found incompetent in every Ministry except the\r\n\r\nMinistries held by the official Ministers, if I may say\r\n\r\nso.

Member for Tanjong Pagar quoting from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes.   This   paper  is  not  run  by  a   charitable\r\n\r\norganisation.

Sir, I believe that there is no\r\n\r\nconfusion  in  the minds of the people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  factual  reports  that  have   been\r\n\r\nappearing in the Singapore Standard, the Nanyang Siang\r\n\r\nPau  and  the  Sin  Chew  Jit Poh  and  various  other\r\n\r\nnewspapers. For example, Sir, I will read out a  Press\r\n\r\nreport which appeared in the Singapore Standard on 2nd\r\n\r\nOctober wherein they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><center>\"'Protect Your Children'</center></b>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">POLIO WARNING TO PARENTS IN THE COLONY</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government last night warned parents to\r\n\r\ntake  precautions  against their children  contracting\r\n\r\npoliomyelitis in view of the increase in the incidence\r\n\r\nof the disease last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Medical Services.

The\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are not in any way confused. They\r\n\r\nhave understood the position quite clearly.

They have understood what they should do\r\n\r\nas a precautionary measure for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I must say that this motion should not\r\n\r\nhave been brought into this House for discussion.\r\n\r\nWhatever little confusion the people may have had is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow increased because of this motion before the House.\r\n\r\nI hope, as a result of the publishing of today's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebate in the newspapers tomorrow, the people will be\r\n\r\nable to understand the problem much more clearly and\r\n\r\nknow that the Minister and the Ministry of Health have\r\n\r\nnot been responsible for all the muddle which appeared\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  the  point  that  we can  all,  whether  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  in  the  Opposition,  be  happy   that\r\n\r\nalthough the methods of controlling and treating polio\r\n\r\nare  still  in the early stage, yet some  progress  is\r\n\r\nbeing  made. It is a matter on which I think we should\r\n\r\nfix our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1945, I was myself a victim of polio in a Japanese\r\n\r\nprison  camp  and there was no treatment available.  I\r\n\r\nwell  remember  the feeling of despair  with  which  I\r\n\r\narrived  under American care in a hospital  in  Manila\r\n\r\nand  received  the  final  diagnosis  there  from  the\r\n\r\ndoctors. However, now I am able to get along  with  my\r\n\r\ntwo  legs  quite happily and the only inconvenience  I\r\n\r\nsuffer  is  that I cannot run and, as I  do  not  like\r\n\r\nrunning,  I  suffer  no real inconvenience  from  this\r\n\r\naffliction.   Since   those   days   13   years   ago,\r\n\r\nconsiderable progress has been made but we must  still\r\n\r\nrecognise  that the science of medicine is  a  science\r\n\r\nand  not a form of magic. We cannot expect the doctors\r\n\r\nto  pull  out of the air a cure which will immediately\r\n\r\nand definitely be final and absolute. The progress  of\r\n\r\nscience is much more moderate than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we leave aside that aspect and the aspect\r\n\r\nof  newspaper publicity which are almost irrelevant to\r\n\r\nthe  motion,  we  are left with, I think,  really  one\r\n\r\ndemand from the supporters of the motion, and that  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  should have been more  centres  and  more\r\n\r\nstaff  to deal with this outbreak. I think it is  fair\r\n\r\nto  say  that the medical services have been expanding\r\n\r\nat an enormous rate during the last few years and that\r\n\r\nexpansion  has  only  been  insufficient  because  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  medical services has expanded still  more\r\n\r\nrapidly.  Time  was when most people in Singapore  had\r\n\r\nnot  very  much  faith in Western medicine.  Today,  I\r\n\r\nmyself  receive frequent requests from people  in  the\r\n\r\ncountryside  to  try and get medical services  of  one\r\n\r\nsort or another provided. The demand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  growing  everywhere  for  Western  type   of\r\n\r\nmedicine  and  the  result is that the  staff  at  the\r\n\r\nmedical   services   with   all   its   expansion   is\r\n\r\nappropriate,  I  am  told, for a population  of  about\r\n\r\n400,000  people  by  Western  standards,  whereas  our\r\n\r\npopulation is about 1,500,000. Consequently, the staff\r\n\r\nis  just not there for all the requirements and, if in\r\n\r\nany attempt to deal with polio, staff were transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  other essential work, it is by no means  certain\r\n\r\nthat  the  situation would really be changed  for  the\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polio is a horrible disease with a high rate of\r\n\r\nsuffering and death attached to it, but there are many\r\n\r\nother diseases in Singapore which do not get the  same\r\n\r\npublicity; perhaps because they are continuous and  do\r\n\r\nnot appear in sporadic outbreaks, and perhaps they are\r\n\r\nof   less  news  value.  But  you  cannot  forget  the\r\n\r\nsufferers  from other diseases in demanding that  more\r\n\r\ncentres  and  more staff should be provided  for  this\r\n\r\nparticular disease. I should like to stress that point\r\n\r\nbecause  the same sort of situation is going  to  face\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  almost all departments  of  the  public\r\n\r\nservice,  as far as I can judge, during the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears. The demand for services from the Government  is\r\n\r\nalways  increasing, but the means of  supplying  those\r\n\r\nservices is at the moment not increasing or, where  it\r\n\r\nis  increasing, it is not increasing at  the  rate  in\r\n\r\nwhich   the  services  are  sought.  That  is  perhaps\r\n\r\ninevitable  at  this stage because of the  adjustments\r\n\r\nthat are being made in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing that does need to be borne in\r\n\r\nmind.  Attacks should not be made which  fall  on  the\r\n\r\nwrong people and which, in so far as the civil service\r\n\r\nis  concerned, might lead to a loss of morale. I  have\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that  in detail many things  can  be  found\r\n\r\nwrong - medical services or any other services - but  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not remove the much important fact that  a  very\r\n\r\ngreat   many  things  are  extremely  right  and   are\r\n\r\nextremely well done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing\r\n\r\nthe  speeches  in this debate, I find that  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething in the motion which merits the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  people. They want to know how the battle against\r\n\r\npolio  is  conducted, who is directing operations  in\r\n\r\nthis battle, what he is doing and what he will do. We\r\n\r\nhave  heard that the expert for polio would  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  his leave arid go to England, but that he would\r\n\r\nrather  remain here in order to see the whole  scheme\r\n\r\nthrough.  Could the Minister also not  stay  back  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and postpone his holiday in order  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  battle  through? If people whose homes  are  not\r\n\r\nhere attach some importance to this battle, then  our\r\n\r\nown Ministers should take a cue from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that the public are all confused.\r\n\r\nThey just do not know what to do. I have been talking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  many  people and I have asked them, \"Why  do  you\r\n\r\nwant  to take Sabin?\" The answer is, \"Oh, we want  to\r\n\r\nimmunise  our  children.\" But I have heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  that the taking of this vaccine is  not  to\r\n\r\nimmunise the population but that it is something that\r\n\r\nshould  be  done  continuously, and so  on,  and  not\r\n\r\nduring an epidemic. I read again in one of the Sunday\r\n\r\npapers  - I think it was the Singapore Standard - which\r\n\r\ngave  a  detailed  report of an  interview  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health. There I read some other  reports\r\n\r\nagain  saying  that there are three types  of  virus:\r\n\r\nType  1,  Type  2  and Type 3, and that  if  you  get\r\n\r\nyourself  immunised against Type  2,  then  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a chance of your being attacked by Type  1  or\r\n\r\nType 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, it blocks Type 1 and Type 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes. Then we have been told too\r\n\r\nthat  the Salk vaccine condemned by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  is  not  effective but  Salk  is  praised  by\r\n\r\nprivate  practitioners  as something  that  has  been\r\n\r\ntested.

I would say that  we\r\n\r\nexpect the Government to pacify the people by telling\r\n\r\nthem  exactly  what is being done for them  and  what\r\n\r\nresults  to expect, and so on.

I do not want to\r\n\r\nwhip a beaten dog but I would like to suggest to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  a few things could be done:  one,  to\r\n\r\nrestore  public confidence; two, to see that the  job\r\n\r\nof distribution of the vaccine and the vaccination is\r\n\r\ndone strictly and effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to get his Expert Committee, who sat\r\n\r\nand  deliberated  on  that W.H.O.

Even up to now, I do not  know  what  is\r\n\r\nthis  scheme to run a commercial radio as  part  of  or\r\n\r\nparallel with Radios Singapore for 1959. I am therefore\r\n\r\nnot in a position to attack the scheme or to express my\r\n\r\nsupport for it. I am therefore put in a position  where\r\n\r\nI  have  to  ask the Government to let us know,  first,\r\n\r\nwhat its plans are, secondly, why it proposed to change\r\n\r\nthe  policy  which was against commercial broadcasting,\r\n\r\nand, thirdly, when it is to be introduced and by whom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I will not have the right to reply, I would like\r\n\r\nto  make  some general observations on the question  of\r\n\r\ncommercial  broadcasting.  Sir,  when  the  House   was\r\n\r\nafflicted  by Ministers who were very keen on publicity\r\n\r\nand   propaganda,  and  we  were  informed   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was contemplating the running of commercial\r\n\r\nT.V.,   there  was  a  sufficient  outburst  of  public\r\n\r\nindignation  to  force the matter to go  to  a  special\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  deliberated  upon  it;  and  we  were\r\n\r\npresented  with  its  Report  which  strongly   advised\r\n\r\nagainst  it. That was in 1955.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in 1958, we hear out\r\n\r\nof  the  blue  that we are going to have  a  commercial\r\n\r\nradio  station.  I would say this. If  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ncommercial  broadcasting is to hand over  an  apparatus\r\n\r\nfor the dissemination of information and propaganda  to\r\n\r\ncommercial  enterprise, then let me  state  my  Party's\r\n\r\nposition plainly and simply. We are not against capital\r\n\r\ndoing  business  in  Singapore.  In  fact,  we  welcome\r\n\r\nforeign  capital to come and do business here.  But  we\r\n\r\nwill  strenuously  object to foreign capital,  or  even\r\n\r\nlocal   capital,   not   doing  business,   but   doing\r\n\r\npropaganda.  If  this  radio  station  for   commercial\r\n\r\nbroadcasting is to be leased or let or loaned either in\r\n\r\ntoto or from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime to time to foreign business concerns, then let me\r\n\r\nsay  that the Government should think again before  it\r\n\r\nembarks on this scheme. I am quite sure all Parties in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  and  even outside this House,  would  be\r\n\r\nanxious to see that no political propaganda comes  out\r\n\r\nof   such  a  vital  instrument  of  dissemination  of\r\n\r\ninformation as the radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand the problem that Radio Malaya will\r\n\r\nface when it is split into two. It means, in fact,  if\r\n\r\nnot  almost  double, then nearly double  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nrunning  Radio Malaya as one. From Press announcements\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time, we are told that there  will  be\r\n\r\nsplit  English  programmes and split Malay  programmes\r\n\r\nbut  that the Indian and Chinese programmes will still\r\n\r\nbe combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, it is a matter for regret that we, who are\r\n\r\ndirectly concerned with these matters, should have  to\r\n\r\nread  this  information from the Press. If  the  Press\r\n\r\nalready  knows, then we should have been  told,  lithe\r\n\r\nPress cannot be prevented from knowing, then we should\r\n\r\nhave  been told and should have the whole picture  put\r\n\r\nbefore  us  before  the  thing is  published.  I  have\r\n\r\ncertain  sympathies for Ministers and  civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  find  themselves  having to  face  a  leak - either\r\n\r\nofficial  or good guesswork on the part of  the  Press - but  this question of Radio Malaya has been  engaging\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Press for a considerable  length\r\n\r\nof    time.    When   everybody   knows    that    the\r\n\r\nFederation - again in pursuance of the same policy which\r\n\r\nhas  split  the University of Malaya - is  intending  to\r\n\r\nsplit  Radio Malaya, it is indeed a matter for  regret\r\n\r\nthat  we  still  do not know what the position  is.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like the Minister responsible to tell  us  what\r\n\r\nthe state of Radio Malaya is now, and what it is going\r\n\r\nto  be  after  31st  December  or,  according  to  his\r\n\r\nDirector  of Broadcasting, after 4th January,  because\r\n\r\nit  seems  that  programmes  cannot  be  split  except\r\n\r\nbeginning on a Sunday. Whatever it is, let us have the\r\n\r\nfacts.  Let us know what this commercial radio is  and\r\n\r\nwho  is  going  to  run  it; and  let  us  then  at  a\r\n\r\nsubsequent  date  have  a  full-scale  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nshould thank the Member for Tanjong Pagar for having\r\n\r\nobtained the right to speak on this issue and thus\r\n\r\ngive me the opportunity to speak on the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the split of Radio Malaya, we are going to have\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore.

The  Teochew community in Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  large  community, I am sure that  every  Teochew\r\n\r\nlicence  holder  pays  as much as  any  other  licence\r\n\r\nholder.  All have to pay $12 a year and a Teochew  who\r\n\r\nhas  a radio set at home also has to pay $12. Why then\r\n\r\nshould  he  be  deprived  of programmes  broadcast  in\r\n\r\nTeochew?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar just now touched on the\r\n\r\ncommercial  aspect of Radio Singapore.

If  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  is going to welcome advertisement,  and  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not broadcast in the Teochew dialect, I am  sure\r\n\r\nit will not be able to broadcast advertisements put up\r\n\r\nby the Teochew community. If the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nof   this   broadcasting   station   will   refer   to\r\n\r\nRediffusion, the Teochew community contributes most\r\n\r\nof  the  income revenue. I was told that the  Teochew\r\n\r\ndialect  was  introduced some time in  1949.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  Teochew listeners were tuning on to Peking  for\r\n\r\npolitical  news, and Radio Malaya then  thought  that,\r\n\r\nrather than have the Teochews of Singapore to tune  to\r\n\r\nPeking, it had better introduce Teochew programmes  in\r\n\r\nthe  station, so that the Teochew community could have\r\n\r\nentertainment, news and other items which the  Station\r\n\r\nprovides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who can read will certainly get their news\r\n\r\nfrom  the  newspapers, but those who cannot read  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  depend solely on the radio. What the Teochew\r\n\r\ncommunity wants is news and entertainment and it looks\r\n\r\nas  if the Government is trying to deprive the Teochew\r\n\r\ncommunity  of this. Even in the District Councils,  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  have multilingualism and not  confined\r\n\r\nonly  to Mandarin. Any dialect will be allowed in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council meetings, and I cannot see any reason\r\n\r\nwhy  broadcasting  in the Teochew  dialect  should  be\r\n\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will be able to explain why\r\n\r\nbroadcasting in Teochew is going to be abolished  with\r\n\r\nthe coming into existence of Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Radio Malaya has  been  a\r\n\r\nburden to the taxpayers. I have also pointed out  that\r\n\r\nit  is the white man's heaven where he can get maximum\r\n\r\nsalaries and so on, and that it should be conducted in\r\n\r\nsuch  a way that it should be .able to make both  ends\r\n\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is very surprising, Sir, that although every\r\n\r\nyear  this  House has been voicing concern over  Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya, still we do not know what is happening  except\r\n\r\nfrom  the Press. Of course, the Government always want\r\n\r\nto  carry  out their policies with the help  of  their\r\n\r\nNominated Members or Ex-officios, and whatever they do\r\n\r\nthey  will try to present them as accomplished  facts.\r\n\r\nBut the Members on this side of the House, Sir, as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  representatives, have  a  right  to  voice\r\n\r\ntheir  concern, or at least to be informed as to  what\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  doing.

B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  subject which the hon. Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  put  down  for  debate on the  motion  for  the\r\n\r\nadjournment  was the future of Radio Malaya,  but  the\r\n\r\nmatter   in   which,  as  I  understand  it,   he   is\r\n\r\nparticularly interested is the announcement which  was\r\n\r\nmade  recently  that the Government  was  planning  to\r\n\r\noperate  commercial broadcasting in 1959, and he  also\r\n\r\nasked   for   further  information   in   respect   of\r\n\r\nspeculations  which had appeared in the newspapers  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the arrangements for broadcasting  as  from\r\n\r\nJanuary next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can outline very briefly what has happened\r\n\r\nsince December last year when an official announcement\r\n\r\nwas  made  by  the  Federation  Government  that  they\r\n\r\nintended to withdraw from the then Pan-Malayan  system\r\n\r\nof  broadcasting and to set up their own  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nDepartment.  They  wrote an official  letter  to  this\r\n\r\nGovernment in the same month - in December 1957 - and they\r\n\r\nasked  our agreement that a Working Party should  meet\r\n\r\nwith  representatives of both Governments  to  explore\r\n\r\nthe  way in which this split could come. At that time,\r\n\r\nI think it was thought that there might be some way in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  headquarters of the Pan-Malayan Department\r\n\r\nof  Broadcasting in Singapore could  in  some  way  be\r\n\r\nphysically  split so that half went to the  Federation\r\n\r\nand  half went to Singapore, and that with the nucleus\r\n\r\nof  that  headquarters  in both  places  it  would  be\r\n\r\npossible   for  the  two  department  of  broadcasting\r\n\r\nimmediately to operate independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The examination that was made by the Working Party in\r\n\r\nFebruary this year made it clear that a scheme of that\r\n\r\nkind  was not, in fact, practicable, more particularly\r\n\r\nbecause  it would have entailed the transfer of  staff\r\n\r\nand  the  staff concerned could not be transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation without their consent. Moreover, there\r\n\r\nwere a number of technical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatters involved in which it would certainly not  have\r\n\r\nbeen   possible   to   remove   the   operation    and\r\n\r\nresponsibility from Singapore; in particular, as  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  know, the shortwave transmitters  which\r\n\r\nserve the Federation are located in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further formal approach was made by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to this Government in May this year  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  ways  in  which the split could take place.  They\r\n\r\nsuggested  in  that  letter that a  Negotiating  Party\r\n\r\nshould    be    appointed   to   devise   satisfactory\r\n\r\narrangements whereby the services which the  Singapore\r\n\r\nDepartment of Broadcasting would still have to  supply\r\n\r\nto  the Federation Department could be supplied  on  a\r\n\r\nmutually agreed basis. They listed in their letter the\r\n\r\nservices  which they calculated that they would  still\r\n\r\nrequire  to  derive  from Singapore  after  the  split\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Departments had officially taken  place.\r\n\r\nExamination was made of the services which they  would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill require and this Government replied agreeing  to\r\n\r\nthe  invitation  to  enter into negotiations  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis.  Those  negotiations are still being  conducted\r\n\r\nand have not yet been concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested, Sir, that the Government had been\r\n\r\nremiss  in  not making some further statement  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  on this matter of the splitting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment, but I would remind hon. Members that there\r\n\r\nwas  a passage in the Governor's speech in April  this\r\n\r\nyear  in which it was stated that this split was going\r\n\r\nto  take  place and that the Federation hoped that  it\r\n\r\nwould  take  place from the beginning  of  next  year.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  in  September this year, when  a  financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion came before the House, reference was again made\r\n\r\nto  the  split which would take place in January  when\r\n\r\nprovision was sought for an appointment of a  Director\r\n\r\nof  Broadcasting, Singapore, in place of the  previous\r\n\r\nPan-Malayan   Director  in   charge   of   the   Joint\r\n\r\nDepartment.  Until the negotiations  currently  taking\r\n\r\nplace are completed, I cannot inform the House exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  the  arrangements will be, or what the  services\r\n\r\nwill   be,   which   the   Singapore   Department   of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  continue to provide for the Federation,  but  it\r\n\r\nseems  fairly clear that, initially at any rate,  both\r\n\r\nthe  technical  services which are now provided  under\r\n\r\nthe   Pan  Malayan  arrangement,  that  is,  for   the\r\n\r\nshortwave  transmitters and so on, and  the  programme\r\n\r\ncontent  of  which  a  large part  of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nprogrammes   are   supplied   from   Singapore,   that\r\n\r\narrangement initially will have to continue. I do  not\r\n\r\nmyself envisage that, as on the 1st of January  or  on\r\n\r\nthe  4th  of January, there will be suddenly any  very\r\n\r\ngreat difference either in the Singapore programmes or\r\n\r\nin   the  Federation  programmes.  It  will  take  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  some  time  to  build  up  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  resources to operate their  own  department\r\n\r\nand  to furnish a higher and higher percentage of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes for consumption in the Federation,  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  therefore be a gradual and not a sudden process.\r\n\r\nI  think, Sir, that makes it sufficiently clear to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  why,  in  fact, up to now  there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nfurther  information to give to the House beyond  what\r\n\r\nhas   already  been  stated  and  was  stated  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  speech, that this split  would  be  taking\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now, Sir, to the announcement which was made\r\n\r\nin  regard to commercial broadcasting and that it  was\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Singapore Government to plan for\r\n\r\nthis  broadcasting  to  be  started  in  1959  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Department of Broadcasting.  That  was  the\r\n\r\npurport of the announcement, Sir, and the reasons  for\r\n\r\nthis  are,  broadly - the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\ndid,  I  think,  suppose correctly what those  reasons\r\n\r\nwere,  or anyway the second one - the first one is  that\r\n\r\nbroadcasting is, I think it will be conceded,  a  very\r\n\r\npopular form of advertising and it has proved  a  very\r\n\r\nprofitable  form  of advertising in  other  countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  certain  other  countries   in   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth. I can instance New Zealand  and  Ceylon,\r\n\r\nand  even  in a small place like Fiji, where they  are\r\n\r\nable to operate a commercial broadcasting service at a\r\n\r\nprofit. In a place like Singapore, where there is  not\r\n\r\nonly  a  large  urban  population with  a  substantial\r\n\r\nconsumption of consumer goods but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  Singapore is also, as it is in so  many  other\r\n\r\nmatters, geographically very conveniently situated as\r\n\r\na centre for a region, it is clearly a place in which\r\n\r\nthere  is  room for a commercial advertising  service\r\n\r\nand  for which I think there is undoubtedly a demand.\r\n\r\nThere  will be substantial advertising revenue coming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforward if such a service is stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for this, Sir, is the one which\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  mentioned,  that  up  to  now  the\r\n\r\noperation of a Pan-Malayan Department of Broadcasting\r\n\r\nhas not cost the Singapore Government very much. With\r\n\r\nthe  proposed withdrawal of the Federation from  this\r\n\r\nservice,  it  is  going  to  become  more  and   more\r\n\r\nexpensive  for the Singapore Government  to  maintain\r\n\r\nthe existing standards of programmes on the existing,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  may  call the national, service  and  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped,  by  means of a commercial service, to  offset\r\n\r\nand   to  more  than  offset  in  the  long  run  the\r\n\r\nadditional  expenditure  which  will  fall   on   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  in  maintaining  its   present\r\n\r\nservices.  I  would  reassure  the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar by saying that there is no intention of\r\n\r\nhanding over this commercial broadcasting service  to\r\n\r\nany  commercial  operator. It  is  intended  that  it\r\n\r\nshould be run by the Department of Broadcasting,  and\r\n\r\nso  by the Government, and therefore there is no risk\r\n\r\nof  the business or political propaganda about  which\r\n\r\nhe expressed certain apprehensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Queenstown, Sir, referred to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of Chinese dialects on Radio Malaya.  He\r\n\r\nenquired   whether   there  was  any   intention   of\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  the present programmes in  Teochew.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, with the Department of Broadcasting,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  examining this particular subject of the number\r\n\r\nof  dialects  in which the Department of Broadcasting\r\n\r\n(Chinese Programmes) are at present transmitting  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  at present transmitted in seven  dialects.\r\n\r\nThat  means  that,  in  fact, no really  satisfactory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes can be given in any particular dialect. It\r\n\r\nis the inten-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion  that  as from the beginning of next year  there\r\n\r\nshould be a reduction in the number of dialects  used\r\n\r\nin  the Chinese programmes, and the intention is that\r\n\r\nthey  should  be reduced to three - Mandarin,  Hokkien\r\n\r\nand  Cantonese, this decision has been  taken  after\r\n\r\nconsultation with a number of influential  bodies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  it has also been taken  in  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation Government,  but  if  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  wishes to make any particular representations\r\n\r\non   behalf  of  the  Teochew  broadcasts,  I   would\r\n\r\ncertainly be prepared to look at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am so sorry to hear that\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary has confirmed that the  Teochew\r\n\r\ndialect  has  been  thrown out  of  the  broadcasting\r\n\r\nprogrammes.
