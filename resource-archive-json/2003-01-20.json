-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the collision between the\r\n\r\nRSS Courageous and the merchant ship ANL Indonesia was  a\r\n\r\nmost tragic event for the Navy, the SAF and Singapore. On\r\n\r\nbehalf  of the Singapore Government, I offer our  deepest\r\n\r\ncondolences to the families of 1SG Seah Ai Leng, 1SG Heng\r\n\r\nSock Ling, 2SG Chua Bee Lin and CPL Goh Hui Ling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  has  been a very difficult time for their  families\r\n\r\nand we share in their grief and sorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that Singaporeans want to know\r\n\r\nwhat  happened  that night and what caused the  accident.\r\n\r\nThe  investigation by the Maritime and Port Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  ongoing.  MINDEF's  own  Higher  Board  of\r\n\r\nInquiry is still in the process of putting up its report.\r\n\r\nIt  would not be appropriate for me to give a full public\r\n\r\naccount at this point. But I will give Members some facts\r\n\r\nof the situation leading up to the collision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSS Courageous, an Anti-Submarine Warfare Patrol\r\n\r\nVessel,  was conducting a regular operational  patrol  in\r\n\r\nSingapore territorial waters. This is part of the  Navy's\r\n\r\nmission of safeguarding our territorial sovereignty.  RSS\r\n\r\nCourageous was in the waters off Pedra Branca. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a spate of violations of our territorial waters  at\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca  by foreign state vessels recently.   There\r\n\r\nwere  a number of violations in the two weeks before  the\r\n\r\nincident, and there have been several since then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the collision, ANL Indonesia was\r\n\r\nheading  out of the Singapore Straits towards  the  South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea.   RSS Courageous was sailing in the  opposite\r\n\r\ndirection.  The  two vessels were headed in  the  general\r\n\r\ndirection towards each other. RSS Courageous had detected\r\n\r\nANL  Indonesia on radar. ANL Indonesia was also  visually\r\n\r\nsighted  by  the  duty  watch  personnel  on  board   RSS\r\n\r\nCourageous.  The  two vessels subsequently  came  into  a\r\n\r\nclose  quarter situation, and both took action to try  to\r\n\r\navoid  a collision. But unfortunately the collision  took\r\n\r\nplace.  ANL Indonesia rammed into the right rear  section\r\n\r\nof  RSS  Courageous and a portion of the tail end of  the\r\n\r\nPatrol Vessel was sheared off. This portion included  the\r\n\r\naft  mess, where four servicewomen who were off  duty  at\r\n\r\nthe time were resting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)\r\n\r\nis  carrying  out an independent investigation  into  the\r\n\r\nincident,  and  MINDEF  has given  MPA  our  fullest  cooperation in this investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commanding Officer and crew members of RSS Courageous\r\n\r\nhave been interviewed by MPA. MPA expects to complete its\r\n\r\nfull  investigation by the end of the month and will make\r\n\r\nknown its findings in due course. Separately, MINDEF  has\r\n\r\nconvened  a  Higher  Board of Inquiry to  determine  what\r\n\r\nhappened on the part of RSS Courageous. Until the various\r\n\r\ninvestigations are completed, we do not have  a  complete\r\n\r\npicture  of the events that happened that night. At  this\r\n\r\njuncture, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate\r\n\r\non  how  and why the collision happened, or to  apportion\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the collision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure the House that MINDEF takes\r\n\r\na  very  serious view of this incident and we  will  take\r\n\r\nclose  heed of the findings of the inquiries and  rectify\r\n\r\nany  problems  that are identified. In the meantime,  the\r\n\r\nRSN  has  taken immediate steps to reinforce the existing\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  safety  and professional  training.  It  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  checks on shipboard practices and operational\r\n\r\ntraining,  and  conducting  a  thorough  review  of   its\r\n\r\nprocedures and processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety has always been a matter of high priority for\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.  There are inherent risks involved in  military\r\n\r\nactivity,  and we take every precaution to mitigate  such\r\n\r\nrisks  with intensive and comprehensive training  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  a  thorough system for risk  management.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  entirely rule out accidents no matter how  safety\r\n\r\nconscious  we  may  be, because other  elements  such  as\r\n\r\nerrors  of  judgement and mechanical  failures  sometimes\r\n\r\ncome into play. Whatever the cause of the tragic accident\r\n\r\ninvolving  RSS Courageous, the SAF will use the  findings\r\n\r\nto  make  further improvements so that we further  reduce\r\n\r\nthe risk of another accident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be proud of the way the crew of RSS\r\n\r\nCourageous  responded in the extreme circumstances  after\r\n\r\nthe  collision  and the way the whole Navy has  responded\r\n\r\nsince  then. It underscores the capability, resolve,  and\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of the RSN, and its esprit de  corps.  In\r\n\r\nthe face of difficult sea conditions, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommanding  Officer  and  crew of  Courageous  fought  to\r\n\r\nstabilise  their severely damaged ship, while tending  to\r\n\r\ninjured  crewmates  and  searching  for  those  who  were\r\n\r\nmissing. They displayed their mettle in the face of grave\r\n\r\nadversity  and professionally and resolutely carried  out\r\n\r\nwhat they were trained to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A search and rescue operation was launched\r\n\r\nimmediately   after  the  collision.  In  the   immediate\r\n\r\naftermath  of  the  collision,  the  Police  Coast  Guard\r\n\r\nprovided critical assistance. Over a period of ten  days,\r\n\r\nthe  RSN  and  RSAF conducted an extensive and  intensive\r\n\r\nsearch   and  rescue  operation.  We  received   valuable\r\n\r\nassistance   from   the  Indonesian  armed   forces.   In\r\n\r\ncoordinating  the  search and rescue operation,  the  RSN\r\n\r\nalso  sought the assistance of the Malaysian armed forces\r\n\r\nfor the search of the Johor coastal areas as we wanted to\r\n\r\ncover   every  possibility.  We  deeply  appreciate   the\r\n\r\nassistance  and  co-operation our neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nextended  to  our Search and Rescue operation.  I  should\r\n\r\nalso  note here the dedicated efforts of the salvage crew\r\n\r\nin  their attempts to recover the sheared-off portion  of\r\n\r\nRSS Courageous under adverse monsoon conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how difficult this must be for the families\r\n\r\nwho  have  lost their loved ones and we are deeply  sorry\r\n\r\nfor  their  loss. After the incident, the  RSN  has  been\r\n\r\nkeeping  in  close touch with the families to  give  them\r\n\r\nsupport  and provide assistance. Professional counsellors\r\n\r\nhave  also  been  helping  them  through  this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.  MINDEF  will continue to provide  the  necessary\r\n\r\nsupport to the families of the four servicewomen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has certainly been a difficult period for the\r\n\r\nRSN  and  the  SAF.  But it is also in  such  moments  of\r\n\r\nadversity  that  the real quality and  character  of  the\r\n\r\norganisation and its people shine through. The RSN  plays\r\n\r\na   vital   role   in  protecting  the  sovereignty   and\r\n\r\nterritorial  integrity of Singapore's waters.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nshy away from our responsibilities in the face of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntragedy.  The  RSN  will continue to conduct  patrols  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  Singapore's territorial waters. I  have  every\r\n\r\nconfidence that the RSN and SAF will overcome this tragic\r\n\r\nevent  and continue to discharge their mission with  even\r\n\r\ngreater determination.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I want to express\r\n\r\nour  deepest  sympathies and condolences to the  bereaved\r\n\r\nfamilies  and I am sure the RSN will put all this  behind\r\n\r\nit,  and  learn and move forward.  I want to ask  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister could clarify  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nstatement   that   Singapore  had  asked   Malaysia   for\r\n\r\npermission to conduct search and rescue operation in  the\r\n\r\nwaters  off  Pedra Branca.  What is our response  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian request for such joint patrols?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Deputy Prime Minister clarify\r\n\r\nwhat  he  mentioned earlier, ie, there  was  a  spate  of\r\n\r\nviolations of our territorial waters at Pedra  Branca  by\r\n\r\nforeign  state vessels recently?  Could the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister please tell this House what actually happened?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the incident happened in\r\n\r\nSingapore   territorial  waters  off  Pedra  Branca   and\r\n\r\nSingapore did not ask permission from Malaysia to conduct\r\n\r\nsearch  and rescue operation.  To put this in the  proper\r\n\r\ncontext,     in    accordance    with    well-established\r\n\r\ninternational search and rescue procedures, there  is  an\r\n\r\narrangement for aircraft to enter foreign airspace  in  a\r\n\r\nsearch  area  to conduct search and rescue operation,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.   This requires prior diplomatic clearance  to\r\n\r\nenter  foreign airspace.  For this particular  operation,\r\n\r\nboth  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  granted  Singapore  prior\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  clearance to enter their airspace to  conduct\r\n\r\nsearch and rescue operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for joint patrols, there is no question of joint\r\n\r\npatrols in Singapore's territorial waters.  Sir,  as  you\r\n\r\nknow, the Singapore and Malaysian governments have agreed\r\n\r\nto  refer  the issue of Pedra Branca to the International\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Justice.  In fact, both sides have  agreed  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the signing of the special agreement on  6th\r\n\r\nFebruary to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Court of Justice.  Unfortunately, Malaysian\r\n\r\ngovernment vessels from both their navy and marine police\r\n\r\nhave  recently  stepped  up their intrusions  into  Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca  waters  and  this  despite  the  fact  that   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government  is  aware  that  after   the   two\r\n\r\ncountries agreed in 1994 to take the case to the ICJ what\r\n\r\nhappened  on  the  ground at Pedra Branca  will  have  no\r\n\r\nbearing on the judgment by the ICJ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three violations by Malaysian state\r\n\r\nvessels over the last week of December.  There were  five\r\n\r\nmore  violations  last  week.  In  these  incidents,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   vessels  came  close  to  Pedra  Branca   and\r\n\r\nconducted  various  activities.   As  Members  know,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian media reported extensively on the 24th December\r\n\r\n2002  incident  where  a Malaysian marine  police  patrol\r\n\r\ncraft brought along a group of journalists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these violations, it is also regrettable\r\n\r\nthat  the  Malaysian government has seized on the  tragic\r\n\r\naccident involving RSS Courageous to try to advance their\r\n\r\nclaim   to   Pedra  Branca.   The  Malaysian   government\r\n\r\npresented  a Third Party Note to the Singapore Government\r\n\r\non   14th  January  2003  protesting  \"the  violation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia's   territorial  waters  around  the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nisland  of Batu Putih\" by RSS Courageous at the  time  of\r\n\r\nthe  collision.   The  TPN further  stated  that  as  the\r\n\r\ncollision   had  taken  place  in  Malaysian  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters,  the  Malaysian Marine Department  had  commenced\r\n\r\ninvestigations  and  the  TPN  attached  forms  for   the\r\n\r\nCommanding  Officer of RSS Courageous to  submit  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Marine Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most unfortunate that the Malaysian government\r\n\r\nhas chosen to exploit this tragic accident which can only\r\n\r\nserve  to stir up emotions and make it more difficult  to\r\n\r\nhave an amicable settlement of the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pedra Branca is Singapore's territory. The RSN\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to carry out its mission of  safeguarding\r\n\r\nSingapore's  sovereignty and territorial integrity.   The\r\n\r\nRSN  will  continue to patrol our territorial waters  off\r\n\r\nPedra Branca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VESSELS PASSING THROUGH SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Security measures against terrorist attacks)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  (a)  whether  Singapore,  as  the  world's\r\n\r\nlargest  container trans-shipment hub, is a prime  target\r\n\r\nfor  acts  of  terror; and (b) what are the measures  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  taking to enhance security and  harden  the\r\n\r\narea   against  terrorist  attacks  for  vessels  passing\r\n\r\nthrough the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The Singapore Straits is also one  of  the\r\n\r\nworld's  busiest  sealanes with about 140,000  vessels  a\r\n\r\nyear passing through it.  It is Government's top priority\r\n\r\nto  ensure that incidents similar to the suicide  bombing\r\n\r\nof  a  French  flagship, the Limburgh, off Yemen  on  6th\r\n\r\nOctober last year do not happen here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although newspaper reports have highlighted the\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of terrorists seizing a ship and crashing  it\r\n\r\ninto another vessel or into a refinery or port, there  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  no specific intelligence of such an attack  in\r\n\r\nour ports and the sealanes around Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore waters have been free of sea robberies\r\n\r\ninclusive of terrorism for the past 12 years as a  result\r\n\r\nof  relentless  efforts put in by our security  agencies.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are conscious of evolving developments  and  are\r\n\r\nconstantly looking for ways to protect ourselves  against\r\n\r\nthe   terrorist  threat.   The  Singapore  Police  Force,\r\n\r\ntogether  with other relevant agencies, has  audited  and\r\n\r\nreviewed  the  security measures at our ports  and  other\r\n\r\nlanding  points.   We have introduced  enhanced  security\r\n\r\nmeasures.   These measures include ensuring  security  of\r\n\r\nour  ports'  perimeters, controlling access via  security\r\n\r\npasses,  checking  of  personnel, baggage  and  vehicles,\r\n\r\nclosed-circuit monitoring of port facilities\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nguards.  These are landward security measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seaward side, the three lead agencies, ie,\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Coast Guard, the Republic of Singapore  Navy\r\n\r\nand  the  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore,  work\r\n\r\ntogether and have introduced additional security measures\r\n\r\nto safeguard vessels in our waters.  Sensitive areas such\r\n\r\nas  the waters around petrochemical installations and the\r\n\r\napproaches  to them used by tankers are declared  out  of\r\n\r\nbounds  to  all  other traffic.  The Navy has  also  been\r\n\r\nescorting certain high-value merchant vessels such as oil\r\n\r\nand gas tankers, large container vessels and cruise ships\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Singapore Straits.  The Police Coast  Guard\r\n\r\n(PCG) has increased its deployment by 30% since September\r\n\r\n11.   The  PCG  is also in the process of  upgrading  its\r\n\r\nsurveillance capabilities and acquiring newer and  better\r\n\r\npatrol boats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore was among the first few countries to\r\n\r\nsign  up  as  a  pilot port under the Container  Security\r\n\r\ninitiative  to screen sea containers exported  or  trans-shipped  to  the  US.   As  part of  the  initiative,  US\r\n\r\ncontainer   security  officers  would  be   deployed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore to work together with our enforcement  officers\r\n\r\nto  jointly target and prescreen containers bound for the\r\n\r\nUS.    In   addition,   Singapore   will   be   deploying\r\n\r\nradiographic scanners at our ports from next month.   The\r\n\r\nscanners  will  be used by our officers  to  boost  their\r\n\r\ndetecting  capability for containers  entering  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  help  move containers in our ports in a more  secure\r\n\r\nand expeditious fashion.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JOB SEEKERS EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nfor  a breakdown of the number of job seekers (a) seeking\r\n\r\nemployment assistance for the period January to  December\r\n\r\n2002  from  (i)  his Ministry,  (ii)  each  of  the  five\r\n\r\nCommunity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils and (iii) each of the four self-help\r\n\r\ngroups   (namely   the  Chinese  Development   Assistance\r\n\r\nCouncil,  Mendaki,  Sinda and Eurasian Association);  and\r\n\r\n(b)  successfully placed by the respective  organisations\r\n\r\nas a percentage of the number.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\n(a)  if  he  will  provide a status  update  on  (i)  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation  by occupation,  age  group   and\r\n\r\nqualification  (ii) job vacancies and their  distribution\r\n\r\nin  the  various   industries and (iii)  the  extent  and\r\n\r\nsuccess of job creation; and (b) what other measures will\r\n\r\nthe  Government  consider to change the  mindset  of  (i)\r\n\r\nemployers with regard to employing those above the age of\r\n\r\n45 years and (ii) potential job seekers, especially those\r\n\r\nwho  have  been retrenched and are above the  age  of  45\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower if he will provide an update on the success\r\n\r\nof  the  'People for Jobs' programme implemented  by  his\r\n\r\nMinistry,  including  the  number  of  people  who   have\r\n\r\nenrolled  in  programmes such as the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  and  the  rate  of  job  placement  for  these\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower (a) what is the number of people  who  have\r\n\r\nsought assistance for jobs from the Community Development\r\n\r\nCouncils  (CDCs)  in  2002 and  how  many  of  them  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  gained employment;  and (b) what  is  being\r\n\r\ndone  to  further  improve the job  placement  rates  for\r\n\r\nretrenched  Singaporeans who have sought  help  from  the\r\n\r\nCDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, with your\r\n\r\npermission, I would like to take Questions 5 to 8 as they\r\n\r\ncover related issues on unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> In December 2001, MOM established the\r\n\r\n\"Distributed  CareerLink  Network\".   This  comprises  13\r\n\r\norganisations  -  the five Community Development Councils\r\n\r\n(CDCs),  the  five  self-help  groups  of  MENDAKI,   the\r\n\r\nEurasian Association, SINDA, CDAC and the Association  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Professionals  (AMP), as well  as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Employers  Federation (SNEF),  National  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress  (NTUC), and the Singapore Professionals'\r\n\r\nand  Executives'  Cooperative (SPEC).  This  network  was\r\n\r\nformed  to improve employment assistance services to  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.   This Government and community organisations\r\n\r\nnetwork  would be more responsive to the needs  of  those\r\n\r\nlooking for jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Mohamad Maliki have both\r\n\r\nasked for a detailed breakdown of individual performances\r\n\r\nby  the various placement agencies.  I will provide  data\r\n\r\nin   four  broad  groups  because  they  serve  different\r\n\r\ncommunities: that of MOM itself, the CDCs, the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  and  others which are made up of SNEF,  SPEC  and\r\n\r\nNTUC.   From December 2001 to November 2002, MOM provided\r\n\r\nemployment assistance services to 54,600 visits from  job\r\n\r\nseekers.   62% of the job seekers were provided  with  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  job referral.  Approximately 15% of  all  job\r\n\r\nseekers were placed in jobs within three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same period, the CDCs collectively provided\r\n\r\nemployment  assistance to 38,310 job requests and  placed\r\n\r\nabout  13% of these into jobs.  The corresponding  figure\r\n\r\nfor  the  self-help  groups was  15,961  persons  with  a\r\n\r\nplacement  rate  of 6.4%.  SNEF, SPEC and  NTUC  together\r\n\r\nprovided  assistance  to 8,206 job  requests  and  placed\r\n\r\nabout 19% of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, MOM and its DCN partners attended to\r\n\r\n117,000 job requests and helped 15,701 get jobs.  This is\r\n\r\nabout   13%.     In  2002,  47,000  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  training  places  were  taken  up  by   33,516\r\n\r\nworkers.  Given that the number of unemployed now  stands\r\n\r\nat around 80,000, these figures suggest that the majority\r\n\r\nof those looking for jobs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  where  to  seek assistance and have  made  repeated\r\n\r\nvisits to our Distributed CareerLink Network.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, let me correct the wrong\r\n\r\nimpression  that only 13% of those looking for  jobs  are\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   I  have  to clarify  that  the  Distributed\r\n\r\nCareerLink Network caters to a select group of retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who find it harder to get jobs.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nour reemployment data indicates that in 2001 and 2002, 60-65%  of  those retrenched are able to secure a job within\r\n\r\nsix  months of retrenchment.  The re-employment rate  for\r\n\r\nthe quarter ending September 2002 was 67%, the highest in\r\n\r\nthe last two years.  This indicates that the majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  have lost their  jobs  are  realistic.\r\n\r\nThey know where to go for training and indeed are able by\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  secure new employment.   Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to assist those with general enabling schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in response to Dr Maliki's request on one such\r\n\r\nscheme   -  the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme   - I  am  pleased  to report that more than 3,000  companies\r\n\r\nfrom  various  sectors  have  hired  approximately  8,000\r\n\r\nworkers  in 2002.  This particular programme provides  an\r\n\r\nincentive  to encourage employers to recruit workers  who\r\n\r\nare  40  years and above who may lack relevant experience\r\n\r\nfor the new jobs or work environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members' questions also touch on a more\r\n\r\nimportant  concern that other Members of this House  also\r\n\r\nshare:   \"How  can  we  help  that  particular  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans like those which the DCN serves who  are  at\r\n\r\nhigher  risk  of  being structurally  unemployed  to  get\r\n\r\njobs?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the figures I have provided indicate that\r\n\r\naccess to services  -  dissemination of information about\r\n\r\njobs   and  provision  of  training  courses  -   appears\r\n\r\nadequate, but the actual placement of jobs for this group\r\n\r\nof workers  -  about 13%  -  could be improved.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  we have told this group of people where the  fish\r\n\r\nare,  we  taught them how to fish, but the actual  number\r\n\r\nwho are catching fishes could be better.  Why is this so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute\r\n\r\na  fact sheet (Tables  (Cols. 2131-44) Nos. 1, 2, 3A,  3B\r\n\r\nand  4), which contains the data on the unemployment  and\r\n\r\nvacancy  situation sought by Mdm Ho Geok Choo.   She  has\r\n\r\nasked for a detailed list.  I have provided it and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot propose to go through the detailed list.  Let me just\r\n\r\nsummarise and say that while there were 72,000 unemployed\r\n\r\nresidents  at the end of September last year, there  were\r\n\r\nover  17,000 job vacancies in various sectors.   We  also\r\n\r\nhave  nearly  450,000 foreign workers here to  supplement\r\n\r\nour  local  workforce; in other words, 450,000  potential\r\n\r\njobs held by foreign workers at this point of time.   So,\r\n\r\nin that context, why should there be Singaporeans who are\r\n\r\nunemployed?   Since  its inception in January  2002,  the\r\n\r\nJobs Task Force has posed this question to ourselves  and\r\n\r\nto  our  members who comprise CEOs of various industries,\r\n\r\nunionists, mayors, EDB, and as well as those looking  for\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you some of the common reasons\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Jobs Task Force for this select  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   First  of all, the pool of jobs  available  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  smaller  compared to  the  past.   We  had  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  run  -  15 years of above 7% GDP growth  that\r\n\r\ncreated,  in essence, two jobs to every Singaporean.   In\r\n\r\nthat  climate for 15 years, even those with  less  skills\r\n\r\ncould  wait  for that `dream' job.  But as we  have  been\r\n\r\ndeliberately repeating, the world has changed.  No mature\r\n\r\neconomy,  which  we are, expects to achieve  such  growth\r\n\r\nrates  and  job creation.  Instead, fewer  jobs  will  be\r\n\r\ncreated  which will have higher value-add.  Lower skilled\r\n\r\njobs  will also be available but may be in more  vigorous\r\n\r\nworking  conditions.  It would be unrealistic and  indeed\r\n\r\nfrustrating to wait for the best job to come along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the marine industry, 30,000 jobs were created in\r\n\r\nthe  last five years and even now, there are about  1,300\r\n\r\nvacancies.  With overtime, the take-home pay is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubstantial, with a median wage of $1,800 per month,  but\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  shun  this industry.   In  the  retail  and\r\n\r\nrestaurant  sectors, there are 2,000  vacancies  now  but\r\n\r\nthese  jobs  are not attractive to locals.  Even  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, there are about  3,000  vacancies.\r\n\r\nHowever, some Singaporeans who qualify for these jobs  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  work  in wafer fabs because  they  dislike\r\n\r\ndonning  suits,  working in clean rooms  or  the  12-hour\r\n\r\nshifts.    Others   have  practical  difficulties.    For\r\n\r\nexample, some, especially mothers with children, find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  work  shifts because  the  hours  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  juggle  their  roles  as  caregivers   and\r\n\r\nbreadwinners.  Others still find travelling to  factories\r\n\r\nin  certain  parts  of Singapore too far.   Companies  do\r\n\r\nprovide  transportation, but they have to wake up earlier\r\n\r\nto   get   to   work  on  time.   These   are   practical\r\n\r\nconsiderations  which I empathise with.  We  are  working\r\n\r\nwith  related  agencies  to  see  how  to  address  these\r\n\r\nimpediments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also had feedback that some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nlooked  at  wages and calculate the take home  pay  minus\r\n\r\nCPF,  transport and meals.  If the wages are low compared\r\n\r\nto what they used to earn, they may decide that it may be\r\n\r\nbetter to wait for better times.  Perhaps some can afford\r\n\r\nto  do  so since the average retrenchment benefit in  our\r\n\r\nlast survey was 5-6 months, and they have some savings to\r\n\r\nlive  on.   But we cannot count on the luxury of  waiting\r\n\r\nfor a better and higher paying jobs to appear soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM will continue to work with its partners at\r\n\r\nSpring,  EDB and DCN agencies and the MPs to help workers\r\n\r\nadjust  to the new environment to alleviate unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue to upgrade job matching  and  referral\r\n\r\nservices,  market  training programmes,  and  disseminate\r\n\r\nlabour  market  information  to  job  seekers  and   also\r\n\r\nresidents  who  want  to retrain themselves  for  higher-skilled  jobs and help workers adjust to the new economic\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey conducted for full-time Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngraduates  who have completed their courses  between  May\r\n\r\nand  August of last year showed that one in two of  those\r\n\r\nwho participated in the course secured a job within three\r\n\r\nmonths.  These figures are encouraging and indicate  that\r\n\r\nthose   who   upgrade   themselves   do   enhance   their\r\n\r\nemployability and get meaningful jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I was indeed\r\n\r\nsurprised  to learn that there are so many job  vacancies\r\n\r\navailable.   Could I ask the Minister to  enlighten  this\r\n\r\nHouse  as to how he has arrived at these numbers and  the\r\n\r\nspecific reasons why Singaporeans reject these jobs which\r\n\r\nare now available?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I have provided detailed\r\n\r\nfigures,  in  terms of the job vacancies, and  these  are\r\n\r\ndata  collected from current job vacancies.

As to how to make Singaporeans take  up  these\r\n\r\njob vacancies, there are many factors why they do not  in\r\n\r\nthe first place, and you have to address them one by one.\r\n\r\nSome  Members  may  have come across a  number  of  mind-changing  initiatives that we have tried to undertake  to\r\n\r\nhelp them adjust to new job market conditions.  And as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  we will continue to tackle these  issues  by\r\n\r\nworking with industry and  our related partners to try to\r\n\r\nincrease their acceptability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nrequested  detailed figures of the individual  breakdowns\r\n\r\nof  the various organisations.

But I wanted to  be\r\n\r\nclear,  to  send the signal, which I think  the  question\r\n\r\nimplied  more  than what was asked.  I am sure  that  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot obsessed with details.  What I wanted to show was the\r\n\r\nfour  groups, which tend to different sectors of workers,\r\n\r\nhave  different results, and you can see from even within\r\n\r\nthe  four  groups  that there are different  measures  of\r\n\r\nsuccess, if you like.  I also wanted to emphasise that in\r\n\r\nthe  overall universe of those who were retrenched,  that\r\n\r\nit was about 67%.  In other words, the majority of people\r\n\r\nwho   lose  their  jobs  know  where  to  look  for   the\r\n\r\ninformation  and get it.  More importantly, I  wanted  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the point that it may be wrong, and  we  would\r\n\r\narrive  at  erroneous conclusions by comparing  different\r\n\r\nmembers  in  different agencies, because the people  that\r\n\r\nthey  tend  to  are different - different  employability,\r\n\r\npotential, different educational and training skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I also want to emphasise is that\r\n\r\nwhile  it  is useful and, indeed, it should be commended,\r\n\r\nthat  there are efficiencies to be gained from  enhancing\r\n\r\nour  job-matching  skills, we should not  exaggerate  the\r\n\r\npotential of that impact.  The answer to job creation  is\r\n\r\nto  make  our  economy more attractive  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nincrease the overall pie.  MOM and its DCN partners must,\r\n\r\nof  course, continue to work in this current climate,  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that where there are jobs available, we should\r\n\r\nhelp  people  to get them and, indeed, as  Mr  Sin  says,\r\n\r\nthere are jobs available, about 17,000 vacancies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read about the initiatives of Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong and Mr Ahmad Magad, and his Tampines GRC MPs, I was\r\n\r\ncheered, because of their job programmes which have 1,500\r\n\r\nvacancies.   I  think such measures are to be  commended.\r\n\r\nMOM  is willing to work with MPs who would want to  serve\r\n\r\ntheir  constituents better, and give them the information\r\n\r\nthat  they need.  But we should not exaggerate the impact\r\n\r\nof  that  potential.  There are jobs available.  We  will\r\n\r\ntry  to increase our efficiency and where we can, we will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Ministry be prepared to\r\n\r\npublish  specific  details  about  these  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCDCs  and  advisers on the ground, so that at least  they\r\n\r\nwill  know  where these vacancies are and  perhaps  write\r\n\r\ndirectly  to those who are making the offer, rather  than\r\n\r\ncite  statistics here of these jobs which are  available,\r\n\r\nwhich to many Singaporeans are just as elusive as ever?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I would strongly debate the point\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Sin that these figures are elusive.  He may  not\r\n\r\nbe  aware  of the conditions on the ground.  We  have  an\r\n\r\naggregated  job link, which means that the various  CDCs'\r\n\r\nand MOM's pool of jobs is computerised on-line.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  with  all the CDCs and the self-help groups,  and\r\n\r\nthe   DCN   is  an  aggregated  job  bank  on-line,   the\r\n\r\ninformation is there.  It is not that the information  is\r\n\r\nnot there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have 117,000 visits to our DCN\r\n\r\npartners  means  that access is not such a  big  problem.\r\n\r\nEven  if you assume one person makes two visits, you have\r\n\r\n50,000 unemployed who go there.  And as many MPs know  on\r\n\r\nthe  ground,  when they approach you for job  assistance,\r\n\r\nthe path to the DCN partners or the path to the Mayors is\r\n\r\nnot  strewn with impediments.  Most of them do get to DCN\r\n\r\nquite  simply  and to the CDCs especially, and  they  are\r\n\r\nvery  responsive,  if I may say so.  Job  information  is\r\n\r\ncertainly one area.  But it is certainly more than  that.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have said, I have enumerated many reasons, and  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  work at that.  But  where  there  are\r\n\r\nefficiencies  to be derived, we will continue  to  update\r\n\r\nthe  job bank and specific aspects, in terms of matching.\r\n\r\nWe  are trying to enhance the matching capability, as  it\r\n\r\nwere,  and  this  is  another phase  of  our  job  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nfirst.

If Mr Charles Chong\r\n\r\nand his Pasir Ris-Punggol MPs can level up the system, it\r\n\r\nis  wonderful  for all of us!  We will  learn  from  him.\r\n\r\nAmong  the  various CDCs and self-help groups, there  are\r\n\r\nvarying  results.  Yes, we should share the  information.\r\n\r\nI  have  already asked my Ministry's members  to  contact\r\n\r\nthose  agencies  which  have been  more  successful  than\r\n\r\nothers and, indeed, that will be the direction to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Can I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  why  did he not  answer  Mr  Chong's\r\n\r\nquestion about the four self-help groups, because  it  is\r\n\r\nuseful to know how effective they are in job placements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I did answer, but not in detail as\r\n\r\nhe  wanted.   I  mentioned the result of 6.4%,  which  is\r\n\r\nabout   half   the  average  of  the  entire  Distributed\r\n\r\nCareerlink  Network.   I did not  want  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nspecifics  of each group because I think that they  would\r\n\r\ndetract  from  the  problem, and it  is  not  quite  fair\r\n\r\nbecause they are dealing with different groups.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  message  that you want to send to them?   They  will\r\n\r\nknow it internally.  What is the message that you want to\r\n\r\nsend to the public?  Don't go to this group?  So, I think\r\n\r\nwe  have to be careful in our nuancing, in terms of  what\r\n\r\nefficiencies   there  are.   As  I  said,   the   overall\r\n\r\npopulation  of retrenched workers (67%) gets jobs  within\r\n\r\nsix  months.  In other words, the personal responsibility\r\n\r\nof  a  person  who gets retrenched must  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nenhanced.  Government cannot replace that role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide the training opportunities. We will\r\n\r\nprovide where efficiencies are.  But the fact that nearly\r\n\r\n70% do get jobs means that many people know how to do it.\r\n\r\nThere will be a select group which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  harder,  and this group will  change  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious characteristics.  That was the reason to  have  a\r\n\r\nDistributed  Careerlink  Network  in  the  first   place,\r\n\r\nbecause  we knew that there were differences in different\r\n\r\nsectors of society.  Where there are efficiencies  to  be\r\n\r\nenhanced,  as  Mr Charles Chong has said, we  will  learn\r\n\r\nfrom those who have been more efficient.  But, even then,\r\n\r\nwe  will compare why they have been successful, and there\r\n\r\nmay   be  different  reasons.   Certain  CDCs  are   more\r\n\r\nefficient  in that sense, because they are geographically\r\n\r\nlocated nearer certain sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do not think we want to micro-manage, but we\r\n\r\ndo  want  to make everybody more efficient.   But,  as  I\r\n\r\ncautioned,  let us not exaggerate the potential  of  that\r\n\r\nimpact.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  has reference to my question regarding the  mindset\r\n\r\nof   potential  employers,  especially  with  regard   to\r\n\r\nretrenched employees who are above 45 years  of  age.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  from the handout that quite a big number  of  job\r\n\r\nvacancies exist in the public sector, and these jobs  are\r\n\r\nactually in the general administration area.  I  am  just\r\n\r\nwondering  whether the public sector sets the example  of\r\n\r\nencouraging  potential employers to look at the  above-45\r\n\r\nmore  favourably by starting to actually  open  up  these\r\n\r\njobs  to  those 45 years of age who have been  retrenched\r\n\r\nfrom the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the question implicitly implies\r\n\r\nthat  we  have not been open, and I do not think that  is\r\n\r\ntrue.   We judge it on its merit.  Government will create\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  are general and enabling.   Under  this\r\n\r\nparticular People for Jobs Traineeship Programme, we have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  for  the  first six months,  Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide $2,000 or 50% of your salary, whichever is lower,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  a  very  strong  signal  that  Government,\r\n\r\nincluding  the civil service, would like to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability of those above 40.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> For those who\r\n\r\nare successful in being placed in jobs, does the Ministry\r\n\r\nmonitor whether they are able to hold their jobs and,  if\r\n\r\nnot,  for  how long?

So  we  have\r\n\r\nadded another component that if you stay on, I think, for\r\n\r\nthree  to  six  months,  we will give  you  another  $500\r\n\r\nincentive  for  you to stay on.  So we are  tweaking  the\r\n\r\nsystem  to see how we can make it sustainable.   And  you\r\n\r\nare  right, we need to find out not only in terms of  job\r\n\r\nplacements  for a day because that does not  make  sense,\r\n\r\nbut long-term sustainability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of our effort is to work with industry,\r\n\r\nin  fact, to re-engineer certain of the jobs so that they\r\n\r\nare  more attractive to the extent as possible.

So we have to  go  on  this\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  say,  \"No, no, we are  actually  trying  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  product from you.\"  Then, they  understood.\r\n\r\nBut  these  are little things that you find  out  on  the\r\n\r\nground and you adjust to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State confirm that the Ministry of  Manpower\r\n\r\nis  providing sufficient funds to these self-help  groups\r\n\r\nand  the  various  CDCs to help them in their  employment\r\n\r\nassistance programmes, and MOM is satisfied\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I am never satisfied with the\r\n\r\nreturns gained, if that means that I want improvement.

But in terms of resources, we  provide\r\n\r\nabout  $210,000 a year, including officers and  training,\r\n\r\nand  we  are also now changing the system - that is  just\r\n\r\nfor  employment for the officers to beef it up.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  realise  that structural unemployment,  what  we  are\r\n\r\nseeing,  is a relatively new phenomenon.

So we cannot run away\r\n\r\nfrom  the fact that, even though we have foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwithin the midst of our industries, they do indeed create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  on  the  whole  because  they  make  us  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.

Capacity\r\n\r\nutilisation  in  a  number  of  industries  remains  low.\r\n\r\nBecause  of these uncertainties, many companies  adopt  a\r\n\r\ncautious approach in their investment decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, investors continued to show confidence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore because of our strong fundamentals, prudent\r\n\r\nfiscal    and    monetary   policies,    our    excellent\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   and   our  extensive   trade   linkages.\r\n\r\nInvestors have also taken note of our continuing  efforts\r\n\r\nto upgrade our workforce and our R&D capability.

For   this  year,  EDB  expects   investment\r\n\r\ncommitments  to  be  S$8.0 billion in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  and S$1.9 billion in services.  These investments\r\n\r\nare  expected to create a total of 18,000 new  jobs  when\r\n\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall job market is expected to remain soft\r\n\r\nthis  year.   However, jobs are still being  created  and\r\n\r\nthere  are many unfilled vacancies in the job market,  as\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State Dr Ng Eng Hen has just explained.   A\r\n\r\nsurvey by MOM on private sector establishments shows that\r\n\r\nthere  were about 17,000 job vacancies in September  last\r\n\r\nyear.    These  jobs  are in both the  manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nservices  sectors.   Our economic  agencies  are  working\r\n\r\nclosely with MOM and industry to improve job matching and\r\n\r\nthe  training of our workforce.

There are really two sets of  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  got  to address.  One  is  the  internal\r\n\r\nfactors    which    will   enhance   our    international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness   and,  second,  our  external   economic\r\n\r\nlinkages.   The  internal  factors  have  been  addressed\r\n\r\ncomprehensively  by the Economic Review  Committee  which\r\n\r\nreport will be coming out quite soon.  And I am sure when\r\n\r\nthe  report  comes out, there will be a major  debate  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic ideas are quite simple. We have got to\r\n\r\nkeep  costs  down,  reduce taxes, improve  labour  market\r\n\r\nflexibility   so  that,  as  our  economy  becomes   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  and  variegated,  our  labour  market   is\r\n\r\ndiverse  and  sophisticated enough to  make  adjustments.\r\n\r\nJust  a simple example.  Today, if you drive through  the\r\n\r\ncity  in the middle of the night, it is alive and buzzing\r\n\r\n-  so  many lights are on, so many activities are  taking\r\n\r\nplace.   To  power  such an economy, our  overall  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  situation must adapt.  So in the  factory,  there\r\n\r\nare  mostly  foreign workers, in the financial  district,\r\n\r\nthere  are  our lawyers, they work around the clock,  and\r\n\r\nthere are restaurants to service them,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are buses, trains, taxis, to bring them from point\r\n\r\nA to point B.  We must make all the internal adjustments,\r\n\r\nwhere  necessary,  to  ensure that  our  economy  remains\r\n\r\ncompetitive  in  the new world ahead  of  us  -  lowering\r\n\r\ntaxes,  CPF  restructuring,  labour  market  flexibility,\r\n\r\nmaking sure that our infrastructure is tip-top, investing\r\n\r\nin  education, in worker retraining, R&D.   So all  these\r\n\r\nissues  will be addressed comprehensively by the Economic\r\n\r\nReview Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, we have got to position ourselves to\r\n\r\nexploit  new growth potential in the region.  As  Members\r\n\r\nare  aware,  we have been working very hard to  establish\r\n\r\nfree trade agreements with the major economies.   We  now\r\n\r\nhave  free  trade  agreements  with  Australia  and   New\r\n\r\nZealand,  with the European Free Trade Area, with  Japan,\r\n\r\nand we recently concluded a free trade agreement with the\r\n\r\nUS which, hopefully, should become operational early next\r\n\r\nyear.  And we are not stopping there.  We are working  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  economic integration in the  region,  enhance\r\n\r\nour  links to China, to India and to other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, there will be two big balloons\r\n\r\ninflating  -  China, on the one hand, and India,  on  the\r\n\r\nother.   And we must position ourselves so that  whatever\r\n\r\nhappens to the region around us, we will lift with  them,\r\n\r\nin  other words, strengthen, build upon our strong  links\r\n\r\nto the US, Europe, Japan, build up new links to India and\r\n\r\nChina,  and  then  work our guts out to  consolidate  the\r\n\r\nregion  so  that we will grow along with all the  others.\r\n\r\nIt  is a diversified strategy.  It does not depend on any\r\n\r\none  single link alone.  This is to maximise our  chances\r\n\r\nfor   the  future.   If  we  can  do  all  these  things,\r\n\r\ninternally and externally, then I believe that, when  the\r\n\r\nglobal economic cycle turns up again, we will move  along\r\n\r\nquickly.  The key is to be very alert to changing  trends\r\n\r\nand  to  accept that the world in front of us  will  look\r\n\r\nvery different from the world behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we make the adjustments? Can our workers make\r\n\r\nthe adjustments?  I believe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  our younger Singaporeans who are very well educated\r\n\r\ncan.   Yes, they may have to accept lower wages when they\r\n\r\nenter  the  job  market, some of them  have  got  wealthy\r\n\r\nparents, so they prefer to take a few months off  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  world  and to understand more things.   Well,  fine.\r\n\r\nOur  big  worry is the older workers, particularly  those\r\n\r\nwho  are either used to much higher income, or those  who\r\n\r\nnever  had  the  education because  they  grew  up  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent period of Singapore's history.  So we  must  do\r\n\r\neverything  possible to help them.  They must  also  make\r\n\r\nthe  adjustment and accept that conditions  have  changed\r\n\r\nand  the  things which they would not have considered  in\r\n\r\nthe  past, they should now consider for the future.   And\r\n\r\nwe  must  help  them,  if  they are  in  difficulty,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly help their children so that the next generation\r\n\r\nwill be as well equipped as possible.  If we do all these\r\n\r\nthings, then I think we are in good shape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister,  as  for  the  new jobs that  are  created  and\r\n\r\nbrought in by the new investments, I notice that they are\r\n\r\nmostly  in  the  high-end types - the biotech,  the  life\r\n\r\nsciences.  We still have a group of people who no  matter\r\n\r\nhow  we train them, they are not going to fit into  these\r\n\r\njobs.   So  what  jobs are there left for this  group  of\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we give a\r\n\r\nlot  of  emphasis to high value-added investments because\r\n\r\nthese have got the most direct and indirect spin-offs for\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   economy.    When   we   build   a   new\r\n\r\npharmaceutical  plant  or  a  new  cracker,  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars of investments, but each only  hiring\r\n\r\nmaybe a few hundred direct workers.  So it appears as  if\r\n\r\nwe  are not generating the jobs.  But, in fact, for  each\r\n\r\nof  these  investments, a lot of  other  jobs  are  being\r\n\r\ncreated around them.  Take, for instance, each wafer  fab\r\n\r\nrequires   not  only  PhDs,  engineers  and   polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates,  but  easily 40%-60% are less skilled  workers\r\n\r\nwho  must still move things around, keep the place clean,\r\n\r\ndo the maintenance, do the gardening.  Then there are the\r\n\r\nsuppliers,  there  are  canteen  operators,   there   are\r\n\r\ntransport workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  help them; then in the financial district are  those\r\n\r\nwho do the legal documents, provide the loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most vivid illustration is Jurong Island. After\r\n\r\nSeptember  11, we tightened up security on Jurong  Island\r\n\r\nand  issued  smart cards to those who need to  enter  the\r\n\r\nisland  regularly.  Initially, JTC expected 10,000  cards\r\n\r\nshould be more than enough because there were fewer  than\r\n\r\n10,000  workers.   In the end, we had  to  issue  100,000\r\n\r\nsmart  cards because there are so many people living  off\r\n\r\nJurong  Island.   So do not disdain the high  value-added\r\n\r\ninvestments because each such tip brings along with it  a\r\n\r\nwhole  pyramid of employment opportunities.  If we target\r\n\r\nlower peaks, those lower peaks will be very quickly swept\r\n\r\naway  by  more  competitive market conditions  in  China,\r\n\r\nIndia  and elsewhere.  So our strategy is to go  for  the\r\n\r\nareas  in  which  we have a competitive and  an  enduring\r\n\r\nadvantage  and  trusting  that  in  the  process,   other\r\n\r\nopportunities  will be created.  If the  big  investments\r\n\r\nare in, there will be a lot of feeding for SMEs.  But  it\r\n\r\nis  not automatic.  We have got to readjust ourselves  to\r\n\r\nmeet  these  new  requirements, and not expect  that  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  that we had in the past  must  necessarily\r\n\r\nobtain in the future when the economy turns up again.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we can be quite sure that the needs in the  future\r\n\r\nare  different and that many adjustments will have to  be\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HDB RESALE FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Reasons for devaluation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development (a) what are the reasons that caused\r\n\r\nthe   significant   devaluation  of   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board (HDB) resale flats in recent years; (b)\r\n\r\nwhat  measures his Ministry could have taken  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthis  collapse; and (c) what measures will the Government\r\n\r\ntake  to ameliorate the negative equity suffered by these\r\n\r\nHDB flat owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's economy has been\r\n\r\ngoing  through  a  difficult period following  the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis in 1997.  This has affected almost  all\r\n\r\nsectors  of  our economy and the property  market,  which\r\n\r\nincludes  both  private residential  properties  and  HDB\r\n\r\nflats, has not been spared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the prices of HDB resale flats have fallen\r\n\r\nby  about 29% from their peak in 1996, the decline is not\r\n\r\nas  much as that for private property prices, which  have\r\n\r\nfallen  37%  from their peak.  There are several  reasons\r\n\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, HDB calibrates its building programme to\r\n\r\nmatch the overall demand for HDB flats.  When the take-up\r\n\r\nof new flats under the Registration for Flat System (RFS)\r\n\r\nwas  affected  by the economic slowdown in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  HDB cut back sharply on the construction  of  new\r\n\r\nHDB flats from 1998 onwards.  This helped to minimise the\r\n\r\nbuild-up   of  unsold  stocks,  although  it  was   still\r\n\r\nsubstantial  due  to  the  time lag  between  tender  and\r\n\r\ncompletion  of building contracts.  To reduce the  unsold\r\n\r\nstock,  HDB has focused on selling flats through  several\r\n\r\nWalk-in  Selection  exercises.  HDB's efforts  have  been\r\n\r\nquite   successful,  and  we  expect  to   be   able   to\r\n\r\nsubstantially clear the surplus stock within the next two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, HDB is mindful of the impact that new flat\r\n\r\nprices  may  have on the resale market.  In  pricing  new\r\n\r\nflats, affordability is the primary consideration.   But,\r\n\r\nHDB   also   takes  into  consideration  the  prices   of\r\n\r\ncomparable  resale  flats, and  the  adjustments  to  the\r\n\r\nprices  of new flats are done more gradually,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nminimise  price fluctuations and any knock-on  effect  on\r\n\r\nthe resale market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has in place several financial assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  to  assist  existing  mortgagors  who  encounter\r\n\r\nfinancial   difficulties  in  servicing  their   mortgage\r\n\r\ninstalments.  Through these measures, HDB homeowners with\r\n\r\nnegative equity at the moment are under less pressure  to\r\n\r\nsell their flats.  In 2002, less than 100 HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresale flat lessees sold their flat at a price lower than\r\n\r\ntheir  outstanding mortgage loan.  This is only  a  small\r\n\r\nfraction compared to the 39,000 resale transactions  that\r\n\r\nwere processed in the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property prices go through cycles. After two years\r\n\r\nof  decline in 2000 and 2001, HDB resale prices  remained\r\n\r\nrelatively  stable  last year.  As the economy  recovers,\r\n\r\nproperty  prices  will also recover and  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nnegative equity will be minimised, if not fully resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he agrees that the HDB resale market  is\r\n\r\nbasically a very restricted market in the sense that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  buyers  who  can buy is actually  restricted?\r\n\r\nDoes his Ministry forecast the number of buyers that  can\r\n\r\nbuy  in  the  resale flat market when it builds  the  new\r\n\r\nflats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> On the contrary, HDB resale flats\r\n\r\nare  actually open to a very wide variety of people.  Let\r\n\r\nme  go  through the various people who are  eligible  for\r\n\r\nresale flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, of course, would be the first-timers,\r\n\r\nwho  can actually buy a resale flat with a housing grant.\r\n\r\nThe second-timers obviously are able to buy resale flats.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents and private property owners  can  buy\r\n\r\nresale  flats.   Singles can buy resale flats.   So,  the\r\n\r\nmarket  for resale flats is actually very wide,  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  resale  flats  that  have  been  transacted,\r\n\r\nparticularly  during  the height of the  boom,  indicates\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, there is no shortage of people  who  are\r\n\r\nable  to  buy resale flats, if the conditions are  right,\r\n\r\nie,  they  feel that prices are favourable or  they  feel\r\n\r\nthat there is good value to buy a HDB resale flat.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould not agree that the number of resale flat buyers  is\r\n\r\nactually restricted, or that the market for resale  flats\r\n\r\nis restricted.  It is actually a very large market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SALE OF HDB FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Advertisement)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (a) why is the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\n(HDB) advertising for the sale of its flats; (b) how many\r\n\r\nnew  flats are unsold to date; and (c) whether  HDB  will\r\n\r\nfurther  liberalise its rules to allow flat  owners  more\r\n\r\nflexibility to sell, rent or use their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB introduced a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  new sales programmes last year, such  as  the\r\n\r\nWalk-in Selection for flats in the non-mature estates and\r\n\r\nthe  twice-yearly Balloting Exercise for flats in  mature\r\n\r\nestates.   It  also suspended the Registration  for  Flat\r\n\r\nSystem,  and  it  will switch over to the  Build-to-Order\r\n\r\nsystem from next year.  There is therefore a greater need\r\n\r\nfor  HDB to publicise each new launch, to keep the public\r\n\r\ninformed  of the availability of flats and the  different\r\n\r\napplication procedures for each programme.  To do so more\r\n\r\neffectively, HDB has adopted new publicity measures, such\r\n\r\nas press advertisements and roadshows, in addition to the\r\n\r\nInternet and Teletext.  This is to make information  more\r\n\r\naccessible   to  prospective  buyers  and   to   minimise\r\n\r\nconfusion to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new sales measures and increased marketing\r\n\r\nefforts, HDB has been quite successful in its efforts  to\r\n\r\nsell  its  unsold stock.  As at 31st December  2002,  HDB\r\n\r\nmanaged to sell a total of 10,000 flats in the non-mature\r\n\r\nestates  through the various exercises for applicants  on\r\n\r\nthe  RFS  queue and through the monthly Walk-in Selection\r\n\r\nexercises.  Today, it has about 12,000 units in the  non-mature  as  well as the mature estates that are available\r\n\r\nfor  sale to the public.  HDB will continue to sell  them\r\n\r\nthrough  Walk-in Selection and the twice-yearly balloting\r\n\r\nexercises.   It will continue to assess the  response  to\r\n\r\nits  on-going sales measures and monitor the  demand  for\r\n\r\nflats   and  the  economic  conditions,  before  deciding\r\n\r\nwhether  additional  measures are necessary  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfinalising its building plans for 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are built to meet the housing needs of\r\n\r\nSingaporean   households  and  are   highly   subsidised.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is a need to have rules and  conditions\r\n\r\non  the  resale and subletting of these flats  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  are used for owner occupation,  and  not  for\r\n\r\nincome generation.  Nevertheless, we recognise that there\r\n\r\nis room for HDB to exercise flexibility with flats bought\r\n\r\nfrom  the open market without any housing grant and  with\r\n\r\neither  a  bank  loan or no outstanding HDB  market  rate\r\n\r\nloan.  Hence, with effect from 1st January this year, the\r\n\r\nrules  governing the resale and subletting of such  flats\r\n\r\nhave  been partially relaxed.  This will give flat owners\r\n\r\ngreater flexibility and leeway in the use of their flats.\r\n\r\nWe  will monitor the impact of these changes on other HDB\r\n\r\nresidents  and  the social make-up of our public  housing\r\n\r\nestates  carefully,  before reviewing  whether  there  is\r\n\r\nscope for further liberalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for restrictions on the use of HDB flats, they\r\n\r\nare  necessary  to  ensure that residents  do  not  cause\r\n\r\ndisamenity to their neighbours.  Nevertheless,  HDB  does\r\n\r\nallow  its  lessees  to  conduct  small-scale  home-based\r\n\r\nbusinesses   from   their  flats,  subject   to   certain\r\n\r\nguidelines.   In  addition, under the Technopreneur  Home\r\n\r\nOffice Scheme, aspiring technopreneurs can use their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  as  their registered business address  to  conduct\r\n\r\ninfo-communication  technology-related  work.    We   are\r\n\r\nreviewing  the restrictions on the use of  HDB  flats  to\r\n\r\nensure  that they remain relevant in the current economic\r\n\r\nand social environment.  Even as we do so, we will ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   residential  nature  and  the  good   living\r\n\r\nenvironment of our HDB estates is preserved, and that HDB\r\n\r\nresidents  are  not  inadvertently  inconvenienced  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of businesses conducted by their neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain why the HDB concessionary interest rate is higher\r\n\r\nthan  the private-sector bank interest rate, and  why  is\r\n\r\nthe  concessionary rate pegged above the minimum interest\r\n\r\nrate  from  the  CPF Board at 2.5%, and  how  can  it  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  concessionary when  it  is  higher  than  the\r\n\r\nmarket rate?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> This has got nothing to do with the\r\n\r\nuse of HDB flats, but I will answer the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what is a HDB concessionary interest\r\n\r\nrate?  It is an interest rate which is available to those\r\n\r\ngroups  of  HDB  flat lessees who are first-time  buyers,\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not  private property  owners,  are  not\r\n\r\nbreaching the income ceiling and so on.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  concessionary rate is a rate which  will  allow\r\n\r\nsuch  buyers  to own their first HDB flat  or  to  own  a\r\n\r\nsecond HDB flat as a result of upgrading, ie, it is meant\r\n\r\nto facilitate their ownership of a HDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the HDB concessionary rate has been\r\n\r\nbelow the private-sector rate.  HDB's concessionary  rate\r\n\r\nis  independent of what the private property charges, and\r\n\r\nit  has  always been low.  Why?  Because it is pegged  to\r\n\r\nthe CPF rate.  The CPF rate, as the hon. Member may know,\r\n\r\nis the average of the rates that the various banks charge\r\n\r\ntheir customers, but with a floor.  In other words, if we\r\n\r\ntake  all the bank deposit rates and we average them out,\r\n\r\nthat is the rate which the Government promises to pay  to\r\n\r\nCPF  account-holders, with one caveat: if the  rate  goes\r\n\r\nbelow  2.5%, the CPF, will still pay 2.5%.   So,  if  the\r\n\r\nbank  rates  go up, CPF will pay a higher interest  rate.\r\n\r\nIf  the  bank  rates go down, the CPF will  pay  a  lower\r\n\r\ninterest rate, but with a floor of 2.5%.  It is  an  all-win and no-lose kind of a game, if hon. Members know what\r\n\r\nI  mean, because with the guarantee of 2.5%, the  CPF  is\r\n\r\npaying  higher than what the banks are able to  pay.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we ensure that the CPF savings of our citizens\r\n\r\nactually  yield a good return in order to allow  them  to\r\n\r\nhave sufficient funds for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I explain all this? Because HDB borrows its\r\n\r\nfunds  for the concessionary rate from the CPF.  Whatever\r\n\r\nit pays the CPF for this concessionary rate, it will then\r\n\r\npass on to flat lessees, plus a small margin of 0.1%  for\r\n\r\nadministrative cost.  So, if the CPF rate  is  2.5%,  HDB\r\n\r\nwill borrow from CPF at 2.5%, add 0.1% and charge the HDB\r\n\r\nlessee 2.6%.  That is the reason\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  HDB cannot lower its concessionary rate, unless  CPF\r\n\r\nalso  lowers the rate that it pays out to its depositors.\r\n\r\nI  think  that  is not something that Singaporeans  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see,  because  we want to  see  our  CPF  money\r\n\r\nenjoying  a  good  rate of return.  And currently  it  is\r\n\r\nenjoying  a  very good rate of return, much  higher  than\r\n\r\nwhat we can get from the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, although the bank interest rates at\r\n\r\nthe  moment are lower than the concessionary rate,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid that HDB is not in a position to be able to  match\r\n\r\nthe  banks' rates.  Indeed, for many years, when the bank\r\n\r\nrates  were  very  high, the HDB concessionary  rate  was\r\n\r\nactually  a  very attractive rate, way below  the  banks'\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  at  that  time.   So  we  cannot  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation  when the HDB concessionary rates are  low  and\r\n\r\nthe bank rates are high, to enjoy that concessionary rate\r\n\r\nand  then, when the reverse situation is true, to require\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  to  lower  its rates.   I  think  that  is  not\r\n\r\npossible, because HDB is not in a position to do that for\r\n\r\nthe reasons that I have cited earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether the HDB can consider adopting  a\r\n\r\ndaily  walk-in  selection system for  all  the  available\r\n\r\nflats,  so  that  all those eligible flat applicants  can\r\n\r\nhave more options and are able to select flats faster?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I will ask HDB to consider\r\n\r\nthat.   The  reason  why we have staged  various  walk-in\r\n\r\nselection exercises for different estates is to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  sale of the flats in these various estates  is\r\n\r\nconducted in a way which can be properly managed.  So, if\r\n\r\nyou notice, for each walk-in selection exercise, HDB will\r\n\r\nconduct a publicity programme, put up proper tentage, put\r\n\r\nup  all the proper administrative procedures in order  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  convenient  for residents to  apply  for  these\r\n\r\nflats.   If we were to adopt the suggestion of the Member\r\n\r\nthat  we  open up all the estates at once, then  one  way\r\n\r\nwould be to just simply accept applications, say, in  HDB\r\n\r\nhub.

It has fluctuated\r\n\r\nthereafter,  first falling to $37.5 million in  FY  1999,\r\n\r\nthen rising to $47.4 million in FY 2000, and then dipping\r\n\r\nto $45 million in FY 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Expenditure on Manpower or EOM is the largest\r\n\r\ncomponent  of operating expenditure, fluctuating  between\r\n\r\n70%  and  86%  of  annual operating  expenditure.   These\r\n\r\ninclude    the   salaries   of   the   Judges,   Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioners and other judicial officers and staff.  EOM\r\n\r\nincreased  from $9.6 million in FY 1990 to $34.9  million\r\n\r\nin  FY  1997, and has then fluctuated, first  falling  to\r\n\r\n$27.4 million in FY 1999 and then rising to $34.9 million\r\n\r\nin FY 2000, and then dipping to $31.5 million in FY 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I wonder why\r\n\r\nthere  was this cost increase which I understand was  the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the recent increase in court fees.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts has been increased from $100,000 to $250,000,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the divorce cases were moved from the Supreme Court\r\n\r\nto  the  lower courts.  So, I guess the workload for  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court would be lesser, but why the  increase  in\r\n\r\nmanpower cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, with the implementation and usage of\r\n\r\nIT  for  the  Supreme  Court, eg, the  Electronic  Filing\r\n\r\nSystem,  I thought this system should have increased  the\r\n\r\nefficiency and thereby lower the costs.  So why the  cost\r\n\r\nincrease in spite of all these improvements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the manpower\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the Supreme Court has increased over a 10-year  period.   It is important to see the  increases  in\r\n\r\nperspective.  When the Chief Justice first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecame the Chief Justice in 1990, all of us know that  he\r\n\r\nimplemented, at the outset, not suddenly, but  gradually,\r\n\r\na  whole  array  of  reforms, which has  transformed  our\r\n\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, there were 12 Judges and Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioners.   There was a big backlog of  cases,  some\r\n\r\ngoing  back  to 5-10 years.  So in order to expedite  the\r\n\r\nhearing of these cases, and to increase the efficiency of\r\n\r\nthe courts, and he has done that over these 10 years,  we\r\n\r\nappointed more Judges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of the Judges is also considered in\r\n\r\nthe  context of the case-load.  That is why you will  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  EOM actually fluctuates, going to  a  high  in\r\n\r\n1997,  and then in fact dipping over the last 2-3  years.\r\n\r\nThat  is  because  the  number  of  Judges  and  Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioners  has also fluctuated.   So  when  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the cases had been cleared, you  would  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  number  of  Judges and Judicial  Commissioners\r\n\r\npeaked  at 21 in 1998 and today it is only 13.  So,  that\r\n\r\nis  the  first  point.  We must not begrudge  the  courts\r\n\r\nthis  expenditure because, as Mr Low must well know,  our\r\n\r\ncourts  have  scored  very highly in  many  international\r\n\r\npolls and surveys.  So the reputation of our courts is  a\r\n\r\nkey economic asset.  That, I think, is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, EFS has been introduced. But that really has\r\n\r\nto  do with how documents are filed.  In other words, the\r\n\r\nefficiency  is  in  the  legal  process.   In  terms   of\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the courts, yes, that has also  increased\r\n\r\nwith technology.  But, ultimately, whatever technology is\r\n\r\nintroduced,   we  do  need  good  Judges   and   Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioners.   In other words, the manpower  cost  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  there.   We  should not  apologise  for  these\r\n\r\nsalaries which are well spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State says that\r\n\r\nthe   efficiency   of   the  legal   process,   ie,   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of EFS, should be differentiated from  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of the courts.

EFS is only  one\r\n\r\ncomponent that was introduced in the last 4-5 years.   In\r\n\r\nfact, we have just  completed  the phasing in of the EFS.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chief Justice took over in 1991 and started  his\r\n\r\nreforms, his reforms were more deep-seated, spanning, for\r\n\r\nexample,  case management, doing away with archaic  civil\r\n\r\nprocedure rules, and introducing a mindset change,  where\r\n\r\nbesides oral advocacy, there was more emphasis on written\r\n\r\nadvocacy, in other words, submissions, to ensure that the\r\n\r\nlawyers do not waste court time unnecessarily.  All these\r\n\r\nmeasures  enhanced  the  way in  which  cases  are  heard\r\n\r\nthrough  the court system, and that is what is  meant  by\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency of the court system.  These are not  just\r\n\r\nbased on one system.  If Mr Low had been listening to the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice's Opening of the Legal Year  speech  every\r\n\r\nyear, he would have seen what we have talked about.  When\r\n\r\nwe  talk  about  the efficiency of the court,  it  really\r\n\r\nstraddles   many  of  these  fundamentals  and  important\r\n\r\nchanges  which, like I have said, have helped our  courts\r\n\r\ngain widespread recognition and a good standing, not just\r\n\r\nin Singapore, but also in the region and world-wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I understand that the\r\n\r\nexplanation for the recent increase in the Supreme  Court\r\n\r\nfees  was  due to cost increases.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mdm Halimah's\r\n\r\nquestion comes in different parts.  As to her first part,\r\n\r\nwhether the ability of low income Singaporeans to  pursue\r\n\r\nclaims  in  court  will be affected by the  recent  court\r\n\r\nincreases,  let  me  assure her and the  House  that  the\r\n\r\nability  of low income Singaporeans to pursue  claims  in\r\n\r\ncourt  will  not  be affected by the recent  increase  in\r\n\r\ncourt hearing fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice, in his recent speech when he\r\n\r\nopened   the   Legal  Year,  allayed  the   concerns   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in  this  regard.   This  is  because   the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  civil cases involving ordinary Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  cases  involving actions for damages  for  death  or\r\n\r\npersonal  injuries,  family or matrimonial  cases,  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  adoption of children, guardianship of  infants\r\n\r\nor  the maintenance of parents.  All these types of cases\r\n\r\nare not subject to court hearing fees.  The Criminal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcedure Code does not impose hearing fees for  criminal\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, and this is an important point, the recent\r\n\r\nincrease  in  court fees only affects  litigants  in  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court, which constitutes a very small percentage\r\n\r\nof  all our court users.  Only about 3.4% of writs  filed\r\n\r\nin  2002  were filed in the High Court.  The  Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts handled an overwhelming majority of 96.6% of civil\r\n\r\ncases   in   Singapore  in  2002.   Hence,  a  negligible\r\n\r\nproportion of the population is actually affected by  the\r\n\r\nfee  increases.  In addition, about 70% of the  litigants\r\n\r\nin the High Court are corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further safeguard is that the Registrar has the\r\n\r\npower  to waive or defer the payment of hearing  fees  in\r\n\r\ngenuine cases of hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked, Sir, in part 2 and part 3 of\r\n\r\nher  question,  about legal aid, and how  the  legal  aid\r\n\r\nimpacts  the  Singaporeans,  particularly  lower   income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legal Aid Bureau extended assistance to\r\n\r\n16,248 persons between April 1999 and March 2002.   Since\r\n\r\nthe  means test for legal aid was last revised  in  April\r\n\r\n2001, there has been a substantial increase in the number\r\n\r\nof  persons who have been granted legal aid.  In FY 2001,\r\n\r\n6,571  persons  were granted legal aid,  as  compared  to\r\n\r\n4,968 persons in FY 2000 and 4,709 persons in FY 1999, in\r\n\r\nother words, an increase of 40% from 1991 to 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a substantial increase in the\r\n\r\npercentage  of applicants who successfully qualified  for\r\n\r\nlegal  aid.  In FY 1999, 66% of applicants qualified  for\r\n\r\nlegal  aid.  This increased to 70.7% in FY 2000 and 81.2%\r\n\r\nin  FY  2001, in other words, less applicants were turned\r\n\r\naway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these improved statistics, it is too early to\r\n\r\nfurther  revise the current income limit for  legal  aid,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  last  revised only 21  months  ago.   But  as\r\n\r\nMembers  are well aware, the Ministry of Law reviews  the\r\n\r\nmeans test continually and will adjust, when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the final part of her question, ie, on\r\n\r\nmediation   and  other  alternative  dispute   resolution\r\n\r\nprocesses,  in other words, litigants who  want  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  disputes settled have other viable means to settle\r\n\r\nthese disputes and need not necessarily just turn to  the\r\n\r\ncourt  for  litigation, because over the past few  years,\r\n\r\nboth  the  Ministry of Law and the courts  have  actively\r\n\r\npromoted mediation as an alternative to litigation  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans  of settling commercial and relational disputes  in\r\n\r\nthe  community.  In addition, the Small Claims  processes\r\n\r\nprovide  a  speedy mechanism to settle a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\ncontractual claims of up to $10,000 in quantum,  at  very\r\n\r\nlow cost, and indeed up to $20,000 if the parties agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there is community mediation,\r\n\r\nspearheaded  by  the Ministry of Law, since  1998,  where\r\n\r\ncommunity   mediators  have  mediated  more  than   1,000\r\n\r\nmediation  sessions.   Of these,  75%  of  disputes  were\r\n\r\nsuccessfully resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Supreme Court, during pre-trial conferences,\r\n\r\nthe   Registrar  discusses  with  parties   the   various\r\n\r\nalternative  dispute  resolution  processes  and   refers\r\n\r\nappropriate cases to mediation.  Since the setting up  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) in August 1997,  it\r\n\r\nhas  handled 910 cases.  Of these cases, about 770  cases\r\n\r\nwere commenced in the courts but the parties subsequently\r\n\r\nturned to mediation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Subordinate Courts, mediation is an integral\r\n\r\npart  of the justice system and is widely used to resolve\r\n\r\ndisputes.    Through  its  Multi-Door   Courthouse,   the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts provide information to parties to help\r\n\r\nthem  decide  on the most appropriate dispute  resolution\r\n\r\nforum  for their case.  And the Subordinate Courts indeed\r\n\r\nhas  introduced other innovative processes such  as  E@dr\r\n\r\nwhere  disputing parties with email accounts can mutually\r\n\r\nturn  to  for  mediation under the guidance  of  a  court\r\n\r\nmediator, without filing a court action; or Court Dispute\r\n\r\nResolution or CDR, where a Judge helps parties to  arrive\r\n\r\nat a mutually satisfactory solution to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncase by providing a neutral evaluation; and thirdly a pre-action  protocols pilot scheme covering non-injury  motor\r\n\r\naccident  cases where parties are required  to  follow  a\r\n\r\nprocedure   to   disclose  all  relevant  documents   and\r\n\r\nnegotiate  to  settle  the case  before  filing  a  court\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We\r\n\r\nhad to decide whether to give as much details as possible\r\n\r\nto  the  public  or  to keep it to  a  minimum  to  avoid\r\n\r\npossibly creating alarm and panic among our citizens.  We\r\n\r\nchose  to  share  as much as we can without  compromising\r\n\r\ninvestigations because the Government realised  that  the\r\n\r\nJI  episode was not an isolated, once-off phenomenon but,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  symptomatic  of the  terrorist  wave  that  is\r\n\r\nconfronting the world today.   To say little is  to  live\r\n\r\nin denial of this reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in January 2002, we decided that we must engage\r\n\r\nour  people  openly but sensitively on  this  issue.   We\r\n\r\nneeded to ensure that the public revelations of the  case\r\n\r\ndid  not  lead to knee-jerk reactions by Muslims or  non-Muslims  which would impair our social cohesion  and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, squarely confront the issue and not skirt\r\n\r\naround it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officers from the Internal Security\r\n\r\nDepartment (ISD) met and briefed Muslim community leaders\r\n\r\nabout  the case before it went public.  This was to alert\r\n\r\nthem about the case.  They were even told some aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  case  which, at that time, could not be made  public\r\n\r\nyet.   We  wanted to assure these leaders  that  the  ISD\r\n\r\ninvestigation and security operation were focused against\r\n\r\na  group  of  extremists who had turned to terrorism  and\r\n\r\nwere not investigations against Islam\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  our  Muslim  community.  The Prime  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nchaired two sessions attended by over 1,700 community and\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders each time in January and October  last\r\n\r\nyear  to discuss the issues and to address some anxieties\r\n\r\nand concerns which quite naturally surfaced after the two\r\n\r\ngroups of arrests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our religious and community leaders subsequently\r\n\r\nplayed  a major part in addressing anxieties and concerns\r\n\r\non  the ground and ensuring that there was no mischievous\r\n\r\nor  speculative misreading of the JI case.  I believe the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  have so far weathered this  threat  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety  fairly well is due, to a significant extent,  to\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts in holding the ground, helping to maintain\r\n\r\ncalm   and  facilitating  rational  responses   and   not\r\n\r\nemotional or irrational reactions among our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not out of the woods yet. The threat of\r\n\r\nterrorism  is  the single most dangerous security  threat\r\n\r\nSingapore  has faced since the threat of communism.   All\r\n\r\ncountries in the world face this terrorist threat  today;\r\n\r\nno country is immune.  Singapore is no exception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government and as a people, we have always\r\n\r\ntaken the approach of facing our problems, be it economic\r\n\r\nrecession or terrorism, squarely and soberly. We need  to\r\n\r\nde-sensitise  the awkward and difficult issues  and  talk\r\n\r\nabout  them openly and dispassionately so that we may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  able then to grapple with and manage  them.   So,\r\n\r\nalthough the JI and terrorism subject remains a difficult\r\n\r\none  even  now,  we must continue to be able  to  discuss\r\n\r\nrationally  with our different communities in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe threat posed and its implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while I understand the concerns of those\r\n\r\nwho  feel that we should not discuss the JI issue in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I also strongly believe that there is no avoiding\r\n\r\nus  taking  this  road of public discussion  because  the\r\n\r\nthreat  is  far  from over.  To believe otherwise  is  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  ourselves at our own peril.  For these  reasons,\r\n\r\nthe Government decided to release a White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the White Paper will not only give all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a comprehensive account of our experience so\r\n\r\nfar  in dealing with terrorism but also establish, across\r\n\r\nour  various  communities, a common appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\ncomplex nature of this threat.  It is complex because  it\r\n\r\nrides   on  an  ideological  agenda  which  exploit   and\r\n\r\nmanipulate Islam.  It is not about Islam but about  those\r\n\r\nterrorist  groups  and  individuals  who  distort  it  to\r\n\r\njustify  their cause and terrorist acts.  It  is  complex\r\n\r\nbecause its sources are not inside but outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nAgainst  the  backdrop of a fuller understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nthreat,  the White Paper also seeks to explore practical,\r\n\r\neven if difficult, directions we should consider in order\r\n\r\nto deal with this threat as a society and as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Nature of and Response to the Threat</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now spell out briefly the nature of the\r\n\r\nthreat  that we are facing and how we are addressing  it.\r\n\r\nAs  detailed in the White Paper, we believe that we  have\r\n\r\nto  deal  with the threat from groups like  JI  on  three\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Threat to National Security</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the threat to National Security. The first\r\n\r\nlevel  of threat is one of national security.  Since  the\r\n\r\ndiscovery of JI in Singapore, ISD's priority has been  to\r\n\r\nprevent  bombs  from going off here.  The  actions  since\r\n\r\nDecember   2001   have  significantly   neutralised   the\r\n\r\nterrorist  threat  locally.  By crippling  the  local  JI\r\n\r\nnetwork,   we   have  disrupted  their   operations   and\r\n\r\ndismantled their local infrastructure.  Nevertheless, the\r\n\r\ninvestigation  continues to focus on  ferreting  out  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  linked to the JI network and  preventing\r\n\r\nthem from re-grouping.  The investigation into the second\r\n\r\ngroup of arrests in August last year revealed significant\r\n\r\nlinks  between  the  JI network and other  terrorist  and\r\n\r\nmilitant groups in the region.  These have to be  pursued\r\n\r\nsystematically and tenaciously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stepped up the level of security protection\r\n\r\nthroughout Singapore.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   increased  defensive  security  measures  at   key\r\n\r\ninstallations and buildings like the Changi Airport,  our\r\n\r\nborder  checkpoints, important Government and  commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and  oil and water installations.   By  April\r\n\r\nthis year, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will\r\n\r\nbe set up to ensure comprehensive and effective checks at\r\n\r\nsea,  air  and  land  checkpoints  under  one  integrated\r\n\r\ncommand.   Over  the next few months, we  will  begin  to\r\n\r\ndeploy  air  marshals  on  board Singapore  Airlines  and\r\n\r\nSilkAir flights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stringent measures are necessary to prevent the\r\n\r\nentry of foreign terrorist elements and those who want to\r\n\r\nhelp  them.  Singaporeans and tourists and other visitors\r\n\r\nhave   had  to  deal  with  some  inconvenience  at   the\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  but  I believe that Singaporeans  understand\r\n\r\nthe  need for these measures and are prepared to  put  up\r\n\r\nwith  some  inconvenience in return for better  security.\r\n\r\nBut,   as  far  as  possible,  we  want  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do  not  have to  change  their  lifestyles\r\n\r\ndrastically for fear of their safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has done and will continue to do\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  can  to  secure Singapore  and  to  protect\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  However, Singapore alone cannot  eliminate\r\n\r\nterrorism or even the JI network in the region.  The JI's\r\n\r\nregional   character  and  the  Al-Qaeda's  international\r\n\r\ncharacter   and   its  links  to  a   web   of   militant\r\n\r\norganisations  world-wide mean that countries  must  work\r\n\r\ntogether to defeat terrorism.  ISD has readily shared its\r\n\r\nintelligence  on  the  JI and its investigation  findings\r\n\r\nwith  all its liaison partners in the region and  beyond.\r\n\r\nThis  included early leads on JI networks in the  various\r\n\r\nmantiqis    (districts)   covering    Malaysia/Singapore,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Mindanao/Sabah  and  Australia.   Our   early\r\n\r\ndetection of the identities used by \"Mike\", the JI  bomb-maker and \"Sammy\", the Al-Qaeda operative, in the plot to\r\n\r\nmount truck-bomb attacks against targets in Singapore led\r\n\r\nto the arrests of these terrorists in the Philippines and\r\n\r\nin Oman.  We have given access to investigators\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia  and\r\n\r\nthe  United  States to question relevant JI detainees  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We are committed to continue to  assist  and\r\n\r\ncooperate as best as we can with all foreign partners who\r\n\r\nare serious in wanting to deal with this common threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Threat to Muslim Community</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second level of threat of\r\n\r\nterrorism  is  one directed at  our Muslim  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe  actions  of the few in the JI have the potential  of\r\n\r\nsowing  mistrust among non-Muslims towards  Muslims.   We\r\n\r\nmust  zealously  guard  against this.   Many  of  the  JI\r\n\r\ndetainees  regretted  that their actions  have  not  only\r\n\r\ndistressed their families but have also \"disgraced\" their\r\n\r\nfellow Muslims and their religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamentally, the threat which the JI poses to\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans  lies in the JI  members  portraying\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  having arrived at  the  \"true  Islam\"  as\r\n\r\nopposed,  in  their  view, to the  religious  instruction\r\n\r\ngiven  in  mainstream  Muslim society  in  Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nconsistent  finding  by the teams  of  psychologists  who\r\n\r\ninterviewed the JI detainees was that most of them joined\r\n\r\nthe  JI  organisation through religious classes in search\r\n\r\nof  deeper  religious knowledge.  Through such  religious\r\n\r\nclasses,  the JI was able to talent-spot and recruit  its\r\n\r\nfollowers.   These potential members were then  taught  a\r\n\r\ndoctrine of violent jihad (holy struggle) which persuaded\r\n\r\nthem  to  dedicate their lives to the  cause  of  God  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  or  in direct participation in  violent  and\r\n\r\nterrorist activities against the enemies of Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the \"enemies of Islam\", according to the\r\n\r\nJI, was the Indonesian Government as the JI's concept  of\r\n\r\na   Daulah   Islamiyah   was   confined   to   Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  with exposure to the Afghan  War  and  Al-Qaeda terrorist training both in ideological and material\r\n\r\nterms, the JI leaders expanded their vision to a regional\r\n\r\none which included Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMindanao.  If the aim of achieving such an agenda was  by\r\n\r\ndakwah  (missionary work), there would  be  no  terrorist\r\n\r\nproblem  today.   However, their means  to  achieve  this\r\n\r\nvision was by force of arms or violence rationalised as a\r\n\r\njihad   which  they  claim  Muslims  are  duty-bound   to\r\n\r\nundertake.  This led groups like the JI to also subscribe\r\n\r\nto  the  globalised  religious  war  which  the  Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\npreached  against  the  United  States  and  its  Western\r\n\r\nallies.  That was why the local JI was willing to be  Al-Qaeda  proxies  in October 2001 to prepare  to  mount  an\r\n\r\nattack  against  American and other  foreign  targets  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore JI leader, Ibrahim\r\n\r\nMaidin,  told  a  senior ISD officer  that  he  regretted\r\n\r\nagreeing  to  assist in the Al-Qaeda plan to mount  truck\r\n\r\nbomb attacks in Singapore in 2001.  The fact that the  JI\r\n\r\nnetwork  was  exposed  and the plot  thwarted,  he  felt,\r\n\r\nreflected that God was not in favour of it.  However, the\r\n\r\nsecond  group of arrests in August 2002, showed that  the\r\n\r\nthreat  posed  by the JI was not solely in  its  being  a\r\n\r\nwilling  proxy  of the Al-Qaeda.  The  JI's  plan  for  a\r\n\r\nregional  Daulah Islamiyah to be achieved  by  force  and\r\n\r\nterror  was  quietly and systematically pursued.   Dakwah\r\n\r\nunits  were converted into operation units.  Male members\r\n\r\nwere sent for military training; preparatory training was\r\n\r\nconducted  in  Malaysia and armed training was  conducted\r\n\r\nwith  Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and with the  Moro  Islamic\r\n\r\nLiberation  Front (MILF) in Mindanao.  Secret operational\r\n\r\ncells were formed and were tasked by the JI leadership in\r\n\r\nJohor  to conduct reconnaissance of targets suitable  for\r\n\r\nattack  in  the  future.  This was not  in  some  distant\r\n\r\nfuture;  they  were supposed to execute  their  plans  in\r\n\r\n2004, which is next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI's strategic blue-print for action is\r\n\r\ncontained  in  a secret document called the Pedoman  Umum\r\n\r\nPerjuangan   Jemaah  Islamiyah,  which   means   \"General\r\n\r\nGuidelines  on  the  Struggle of the  Jemaah  Islamiyah\".\r\n\r\nLike its mentor, the Al-Qaeda, the JI is a determined and\r\n\r\nhighly organised body which systematically collected  and\r\n\r\ndocumented  information and knowledge like  how  to  make\r\n\r\nbombs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  to  conduct  training  and  assess  suitability   of\r\n\r\ncandidates, how to avoid detection by the authorities and\r\n\r\nso  on.  The  JI  is in fact a knowledge-based,  learning\r\n\r\norganisation.   Among the documents we have  obtained  so\r\n\r\nfar  are  several training manuals, including  a  35-page\r\n\r\nbomb-making manual written in Malay.  Some of  the  other\r\n\r\ndocuments are written in Malay, Bahasa Indonesia,  Arabic\r\n\r\nand even English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of radicalisation of the JI organisation,\r\n\r\nand the sophistication of its tradecraft derived from the\r\n\r\nAl-Qaeda, was a surprise to many.  Indeed, no country was\r\n\r\naware  of  the JI as a terrorist organisation  until  the\r\n\r\nexposure of the network in Singapore following the  first\r\n\r\ngroup of arrests by ISD in December 2001.  However,  what\r\n\r\nwas  the  most  shocking and saddest  discovery  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must be the fact that the JI  was  able  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  some  Singaporeans who were  prepared  to  stage\r\n\r\nterrorist actions inside Singapore which would injure and\r\n\r\nkill other Singaporeans, Muslims as well as non-Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did such Singaporeans who were by no means\r\n\r\nmarginalised or ignorant wind up this way?  Many  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees  now regretted their actions and attributed  it\r\n\r\nto  their  blind  loyalty  to  their  leaders  and  their\r\n\r\nteachings.   They  were in search of religious  knowledge\r\n\r\nbut got sucked into a militant ideology and were infected\r\n\r\nby  its hatred and radical and violent values.  A few had\r\n\r\nsome  doubts but they felt they were too deeply  involved\r\n\r\nto   withdraw.   Moreover,  they  had  taken   oaths   of\r\n\r\nallegiance,  or the bai'ah, to their leaders  which  were\r\n\r\nsworn  in the name of God and feared retribution if  they\r\n\r\nshould betray their vows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the rest of Southeast Asia, Singapore has also\r\n\r\nbeen  touched  by  the  religious  revivalism,  including\r\n\r\nIslamic  revivalism, seen in the world since  the  1970s.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Islamic  world, a few events have  been  key  in\r\n\r\ndefining the contours of political activism.  While  most\r\n\r\nof its manifestations were non-violent even if assertive,\r\n\r\nin some cases, political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextremism  led  to terrorism.  The Middle  East  conflict\r\n\r\n(1948  to  now)  has  spawned many radical  militant  and\r\n\r\nterrorist  groups  and is likely to continue  to  sustain\r\n\r\nthem  so long as the political conflict remains unchanged\r\n\r\nthere.   The Iranian Revolution (1979) saw the successful\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a purist Islamic theocracy  and  was  a\r\n\r\nsource  of inspiration to many Muslim communities in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   However,  it  also  inspired  a  resurgence   of\r\n\r\ncompetition by Saudi-based groups which promoted an Arab-based  culture  and  its interpretation  of  Islam.   The\r\n\r\nSoviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) was another watershed event\r\n\r\nwhich  saw a superior Soviet military succumbing  to  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  mujahidin (warriors) who had come from all  parts\r\n\r\nof  the  world.   The outcome gave hope that  they  could\r\n\r\nstand  up  to the superpowers.  However, an aftermath  of\r\n\r\nthat  war  was the growth and development of the Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\nand  its  links  through  the  Afghan  veterans  into  an\r\n\r\ninternational  network  which  unified  and   radicalised\r\n\r\nmilitant  groups broadly under its globalised  agenda  of\r\n\r\nreligious  war against the United States and its  Western\r\n\r\nallies  while, at the same time, significantly  developed\r\n\r\ntheir  operational terrorist capacities.  Our Singaporean\r\n\r\nJI  members belonged to an organisation which was part of\r\n\r\nthis   broader  network  and  which  made  it   a   ready\r\n\r\noperational instrument for the Al-Qaeda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a backdrop which we cannot ignore. Our\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans  cannot hope to  be  insulated  from\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the Muslim world any more than  Christian\r\n\r\nor  Buddhist  or  Hindu Singaporeans  can  be  completely\r\n\r\nuntouched by developments among their religious  brethren\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  However, while it is natural for us  to  feel\r\n\r\nempathy  for the plight or sufferings of  fellow Muslims,\r\n\r\nChristians,  Buddhists or Hindus,  it  is  quite  another\r\n\r\nthing altogether to do so by crossing the line to support\r\n\r\nextremist violence and terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me state here clearly and\r\n\r\nwithout ambiguity for the record that this Government has\r\n\r\nno problems with religious piety, whichever the religion.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will  not tolerate the use of violence to  perpetrate\r\n\r\nany  cause   -  be it religious or political or whatever.\r\n\r\nWhile Muslim Singaporeans know where to draw the line and\r\n\r\nknow that their empathy should not translate into support\r\n\r\nfor or participation in violence, the JI episode tells us\r\n\r\nnot only that a few have strayed across the line, it also\r\n\r\npoints to the vulnerability of others like them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the JI and current terrorist threat is\r\n\r\nideological  because its ability to recruit  members  and\r\n\r\nget  them to participate in its terrorist agenda  resides\r\n\r\nin  its  leaders' ability to manipulate Islamic doctrines\r\n\r\nto rationalise such action.  The first real target of the\r\n\r\nJI and the current terrorist threat is therefore actually\r\n\r\nour  Muslim  community because this is  the  constituency\r\n\r\nwhich  is  being targeted by the JI for its  recruitment.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a need for our Muslim religious and  community\r\n\r\nleaders  to  explore how they can protect  the  community\r\n\r\nagainst  such a threat.  The White Paper recommends  that\r\n\r\nrather than the Government intervening in this arena,  it\r\n\r\nis  best  that  the community devise ways  and  means  to\r\n\r\npolice  the  threat  and  prevent radical  and  extremist\r\n\r\nteachings from subverting our mainstream religious  order\r\n\r\nor  bodies.  This must be pursued in a manner which  does\r\n\r\nnot  impair the legitimate religious beliefs or  pursuits\r\n\r\nof  the  community.  The approach should seek to  consult\r\n\r\nand  involve  as  many  of  our religious  and  community\r\n\r\nleaders  as  possible  to develop structures  or  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich are practical, realistic and robust.  I believe  we\r\n\r\nhave  good  and  reputable religious scholars  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.  They should be encouraged to give clear and firm\r\n\r\nguidance  to  the  community on the issue  of  terrorism.\r\n\r\nWhile we may disagree on some issues, we cannot afford to\r\n\r\nbe divided on the issue of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these measures, no matter how\r\n\r\ncomprehensive,  may not be fool-proof.  Nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  make the effort.  For instance, we embrace  the\r\n\r\nknowledge that the Internet can provide but we also  have\r\n\r\nto tolerate the smut and trivia that it contains.  So one\r\n\r\nway we guard ourselves and our children is with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilters.  Similarly, while our Muslims absorb all that is\r\n\r\ngood  and  right in their faith, they will also  have  to\r\n\r\nfind a way to filter out the dangerous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim Singaporeans should not feel defensive.\r\n\r\nIndeed, they have nothing to be defensive about.  I  know\r\n\r\nthis  is  sometimes easier said than done;  but  we  must\r\n\r\npersevere.  In fact, this is a sentiment which our  older\r\n\r\nChinese-educated  Singaporeans can  well  identify  with.\r\n\r\nMany   of  our  Chinese-educated  Singaporeans  did  feel\r\n\r\nthemselves  suspect  and  under  scrutiny,  or   in   the\r\n\r\nspotlight, as they say, when the threat of communism  was\r\n\r\nrife and communists were nearly all Chinese-educated.  To\r\n\r\ncombat  the  communist threat at the time, the Government\r\n\r\ntook  tough  measures. But we were able to show  that  we\r\n\r\nwere  not against the Chinese-educated that we wanted  to\r\n\r\nwin  over from the radicalised politics of revolution  by\r\n\r\nviolence.  And  we eventually succeeded  in  winning  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming  of the Chinese-educated.  Most Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould  recall  that  until  just  about  10  years   ago,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  faced severe restrictions in their  travels\r\n\r\nto  the  People's Republic of China (PRC).  It  was  only\r\n\r\nfrom  1972 that group tours to the PRC were allowed  but,\r\n\r\neven  then,  Singaporeans under the age of  30  were  not\r\n\r\nallowed to join these tours.  It was not until 1984  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were allowed to individually visit  the  PRC\r\n\r\nfor  business  or  to visit relatives without  having  to\r\n\r\nproduce  documentary  proof.  The  documentary  proof  we\r\n\r\nasked them was a letter, an introduction, and so on.   It\r\n\r\nwas   not  until  1987  that  Singaporeans  could  pursue\r\n\r\nacademic studies in the PRC.  Endorsements of Singaporean\r\n\r\npassports for visits to the PRC were discontinued only in\r\n\r\n1992, barely 11 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we learn from the past. In the\r\n\r\nsame  way  we will win over the overwhelming majority  of\r\n\r\nour  Singapore Muslims to be an active part of a tolerant\r\n\r\nmulti-racial, multi-religious Singapore, by demonstrating\r\n\r\nthat  our  policies are directed against the deviant  few\r\n\r\nwho are distorting the tenets of Islam for their aims  of\r\n\r\nconverting Singapore to become a part of \"Daulah  Islam\",\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIslamic  state  in  Southeast Asia.  In confronting  this\r\n\r\nterrorist   threat,  the  Government  would  rather   not\r\n\r\nintervene with measures directly but instead prefer  that\r\n\r\nthe  community's leadership together with  MUIS  (Islamic\r\n\r\nReligious  Council of Singapore) be given the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  take  the  lead.   The  Government  has  assured  the\r\n\r\ncommunity that it will give whatever support is  required\r\n\r\nto facilitate their efforts in this endeavour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Threat to National Cohesion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third level of threat which terrorism poses\r\n\r\nis a challenge to our national cohesion.  One of the most\r\n\r\ncritical  issues  that the White Paper wants  to  impress\r\n\r\nupon  everyone  is that terrorism is a national  problem,\r\n\r\nnot  just  something which involves the Muslim community.\r\n\r\nFor  the non-Muslims, we have to convince them that Islam\r\n\r\nis  not the problem and that they should continue to work\r\n\r\nwith  and befriend Muslims as they have previously.  They\r\n\r\nmust  also  guard  against irrational prejudices  arising\r\n\r\nfrom anxieties related to the JI episode.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI's aim is to cause ethnic strife in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  divide us as a nation.  Hambali, the Al-Qaeda point-man  and JI operations commander, was certainly aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  likely  strains to ethnic relations if a  bomb  goes\r\n\r\noff.   He understood well that race and religion are  our\r\n\r\nnatural  fault-lines and he thought that he could exploit\r\n\r\nthis  for  his  purposes.   He  was  planning  to  attack\r\n\r\nSingapore  targets and make these attacks look like  they\r\n\r\nwere  carried out by Muslims in Malaysia.   He  hoped  to\r\n\r\ncreate  hostility not just between Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nbut  also  between Muslims and non-Muslims in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  wanted to create an environment of hate and suspicion\r\n\r\nso  that  Muslim and non-Muslim Singaporeans  would  turn\r\n\r\nagainst one other.  If he had succeeded, Singapore  would\r\n\r\nhave imploded with communal violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even without bombs going off, if we allow the\r\n\r\nJI  episode  to  create discord, suspicion  and  distrust\r\n\r\namong ourselves, we would have played right into the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterrorists'   hands.   Although  there  has   been   some\r\n\r\nawkwardness between Muslims and non-Muslims in  Singapore\r\n\r\nsince  the JI arrests, especially in the initial periods,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have generally reacted to  the  JI  arrests\r\n\r\nrationally.    In  fact,  after  the  JI  arrests,   many\r\n\r\nindividual  Singaporeans instinctively  sympathised  with\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans whom they knew would be subjected  to\r\n\r\neven  more stress and scrutiny through no fault of  their\r\n\r\nown.   On  their  own and quietly with  no  publicity  or\r\n\r\nfanfare,  some Singaporeans have tried to do their  part.\r\n\r\nThis has not been revealed before but that the very first\r\n\r\nfew Singaporeans who contributed money to the families of\r\n\r\nthe  JI  detainees  were four Chinese businessmen.   When\r\n\r\napproached, they immediately donated a total  of  $20,000\r\n\r\nto help these families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has since 11 September 2001 and the\r\n\r\nJI   arrests  intensified  efforts  to  increase   common\r\n\r\nunderstanding between the different ethnic and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups.   One of the first concrete plans the  Government\r\n\r\nput  in  place  was  the  establishment  of  Inter-Racial\r\n\r\nConfidence  Circles  (IRCCs) to bring together  religious\r\n\r\nand  community  leaders to build trust and  understanding\r\n\r\namong  different groups.  Harmony Circles (HCs) are being\r\n\r\nformed in schools, workplaces and local organisations  to\r\n\r\nreach  out to more people.  All these are on top of  what\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots bodies have been doing on a regular basis\r\n\r\nto promote inter-cultural activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has suggested that religious\r\n\r\ngroups  in  Singapore adopt a Code of Religious  Harmony.\r\n\r\nThis  code is not meant to bind individuals or groups  to\r\n\r\nits strict prescriptions in an iron clad fashion.  It  is\r\n\r\nmore  a  code to remind ourselves that we are  relatively\r\n\r\nfree  to  practise our religions and beliefs  in  a  safe\r\n\r\nenvironment.   This  precious freedom,  however,  is  not\r\n\r\nabsolute;  there  are  limits, and necessarily  so  in  a\r\n\r\nsecular  multi-ethnic  state like  Singapore.   If  every\r\n\r\ncommunity  pushes  for the maximum, then  inevitably  the\r\n\r\nmajority will overwhelm and subjugate the minorities.  It\r\n\r\nis mutual restraint and tolerance and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrength of the bonds which unify the races in the common\r\n\r\nspaces  which  would  determine the  extent  of  relative\r\n\r\nfreedom for each ethnic community which our society as  a\r\n\r\nwhole can accommodate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics have said that the activities of the\r\n\r\nIRCCs  and  HCs  are  superficial  and  that  these   are\r\n\r\nartificial constructs which cannot be expected to  really\r\n\r\nfoster understanding among Singaporeans.  It is true that\r\n\r\nthese    are   conscious   and   deliberately   developed\r\n\r\nstructures.   These  are vehicles  which  hopefully  will\r\n\r\nsteer  and mobilise participation over a sensitive social\r\n\r\narea  in  an awkward time.  I agree that it will  all  be\r\n\r\nineffective  if  these efforts begin  and  end  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  What we hope to do is to set the tone and to\r\n\r\ncreate the opportunities for Singaporeans to think  about\r\n\r\nand   to   promote  interaction.   Ultimately,   however,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans themselves must individually make the effort\r\n\r\nto build meaningful relationships with each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in\r\n\r\nSeptember 2001, the world has intensified its scrutiny of\r\n\r\nIslam  because Osama Bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda professed\r\n\r\nthemselves  to be good Muslims who perpetrated  terrorism\r\n\r\nfor the good of Islam.  As a result, Muslims all over the\r\n\r\nworld have found themselves in the spotlight.  They  find\r\n\r\nthemselves in the position of having to demonstrate their\r\n\r\nnon-support of terrorist actions and, at the  same  time,\r\n\r\ndefend against prejudices which may see Islam as a  faith\r\n\r\nof  the  violent rather than of the peaceful.  Our Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have not been spared from this trauma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fortunately for us, our Muslim leaders have\r\n\r\ndealt   with   the   unwelcome   attention   firmly   and\r\n\r\ncourageously.   After 11 September, our  Muslim  leaders,\r\n\r\nincluding  Members of Parliament, religious leaders,  and\r\n\r\nother community leaders, stood up quickly to issue strong\r\n\r\nstatements  condemning the acts of  violence.   When  the\r\n\r\ndetention  of the JI members was made public, they  again\r\n\r\nstood up to denounce the JI group's actions.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarified  that  Islam had nothing to do with  terrorism.\r\n\r\nIn  a strong show of solidarity and conviction, more than\r\n\r\n<br><br>120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim  organisations led by Habib  Syed  Hassan  of\r\n\r\nBa'alwie  Mosque  issued in October  last  year  a  joint\r\n\r\nstatement to condemn terrorism unequivocally.  Our Muslim\r\n\r\nleaders'  declaration, as well as our  Malay  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament's  quick  response, that Islam  and  terrorism\r\n\r\nshould  not  be linked in any way is critical.   We  have\r\n\r\nseen  how,  in  some  parts of the  world,  the  acts  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  whether by Osama or other  groups,  were  not\r\n\r\ncondemned  but  celebrated.  The JI  episode  could  have\r\n\r\ncaused  tensions  which  could  undermine  ethnic  trust.\r\n\r\nUnderlying  all  the reactions of Singaporeans,  whatever\r\n\r\nthey  have been, is a sense that we must strive to handle\r\n\r\nthe  problem  rationally and calmly and not  rupture  the\r\n\r\npeace that we have invested so much over time in building\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we recognise that Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, like Muslims elsewhere, face the  difficult\r\n\r\ntask of debunking stereotypes and prejudices arising from\r\n\r\nemotional  and  ill-informed reactions to  terrorism.   I\r\n\r\nknow  that  it must sometimes be a bit tiresome  for  our\r\n\r\nMuslims   to   repeat  their  stand  against   terrorism.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we know also that there are non-Muslim  leaders\r\n\r\nwho  feel the same way about having to reiterate the call\r\n\r\nfor openness, tolerance and trust.  Some may ask how many\r\n\r\ntimes must we do this.  The answer, I believe, is for  as\r\n\r\nlong  as  there is a need for a countervailing  voice  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  last word heard is  not  that  of  the\r\n\r\nextremist  or  the terrorist; for as long  as  there  are\r\n\r\nanxieties still festering and prejudices still likely  to\r\n\r\nbrew  and  congeal  if not checked  and  countered.   The\r\n\r\nalternative  is to keep silent and pretend there  are  no\r\n\r\nproblems  by  looking the other way.  What our  community\r\n\r\nleaders  think  and what is percolating at the  emotional\r\n\r\nlevel on the ground must not automatically be assumed  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  same;  we  must work at ensuring  that  what  is\r\n\r\nsubscribed  intellectually must also be supported  by  an\r\n\r\nemotional  commitment to act accordingly.  The Government\r\n\r\non its part will and must continue to be vigilant against\r\n\r\nsigns  of  misperceptions of mistrust manifested  on  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me summarise what I have just\r\n\r\nsaid.  The Government  decided to issue a White Paper  on\r\n\r\nJI  and  terrorism because we cannot afford  to  live  in\r\n\r\ndenial and delude ourselves that the problem is over.  As\r\n\r\nBali  has shown, the fight against terrorism is far  from\r\n\r\nover  and  promises to be a long one.   This  is  largely\r\n\r\nbecause  its  primary  sources  and  causes  lie  not  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but elsewhere.  Eradicating them once  and  for\r\n\r\nall is not something that we ourselves can do alone.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has done whatever it can to secure our borders\r\n\r\nand  to enhance the security of our people but there  are\r\n\r\nno  guarantees.  Nevertheless, in a more dangerous world,\r\n\r\nSingapore still remains one of the safest places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes the nature of the threat\r\n\r\nin  detail  as  we  want Singaporeans to appreciate  that\r\n\r\nglobal  terrorism in its current form is  a  layered  and\r\n\r\ncomplex  one,  and  is,  at  its  heart,  an  ideological\r\n\r\nchallenge.   This is a much more difficult  challenge  to\r\n\r\nconfront  than  the task of trying to stop the  terrorist\r\n\r\nacts  themselves.   We are heartened  that  many  of  our\r\n\r\nMuslim  leaders have already issued statements to express\r\n\r\ntheir  understanding and support of the White  Paper.   A\r\n\r\nkey strategy to overcome this challenge is to entrust our\r\n\r\nMuslim  community leaders with the role  to  protect  and\r\n\r\nguide  the more vulnerable members in the community  from\r\n\r\nbeing misled or subverted by extremist teachings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, this White Paper urges all Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nreject   terrorism,  whatever  the   cause.    It   urges\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to appreciate that once they accept that, in\r\n\r\nsome  situations, it is all right to use violence and  to\r\n\r\nperpetrate terrorist acts against the innocent  for  some\r\n\r\ncause,  religious or political or otherwise,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  crossed  the  dangerous line.  This  could  destroy\r\n\r\nSingapore as a multi-racial, multi-religious society.  If\r\n\r\na  bomb explodes tomorrow, it would hurt Muslims as  well\r\n\r\nas  non-Muslims.   And  the reactions  of  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities would be different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at Bali where the terrorist attacks killed\r\n\r\nabout 200 people.  Immediately, there was tension between\r\n\r\nthe  majority  who  are Hindus and the minority  who  are\r\n\r\nMuslims.   And  they  have  been  living  there  together\r\n\r\npeacefully  for  years  without problems.   Take  another\r\n\r\nexample - Russia.  There are reports that as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  hostage-taking  incident by the  Chechen  rebels  in\r\n\r\nMoscow, there is now an \"Islamophobia\" in Russia, despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that Muslims have lived side by side with  the\r\n\r\nother  Russians  even in the days of  the  Czars.   These\r\n\r\ntypes  of  reactions were also seen in the United  States\r\n\r\nafter September 11 and in Australia after Bali.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prevent fractures in our society of the\r\n\r\nkind  that other societies have experienced.  We have  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that we cannot afford for a bomb to  explode  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   before  we  start  asking   ourselves   tough\r\n\r\nquestions  and  taking measures to enhance  our  national\r\n\r\ncohesion.  All Singaporeans must understand and do  their\r\n\r\npart as our survival depends on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper and this debate in\r\n\r\nParliament  will be scrutinised not only by  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbut  also by the world outside.  They will watch  whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  united  across parties and communities  and  are\r\n\r\ndetermined to deal with the threat or are we divided  and\r\n\r\nin  denial, squabbling over secondary issues and  who  to\r\n\r\nblame.   Whether our foreign investors will view us  with\r\n\r\nconfidence or with anxiety will be influenced by  how  we\r\n\r\nrespond as a Government and as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of this House for the White Paper and\r\n\r\nthe  Motion  will reassure our people of the Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment and firm actions in countering the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism and in encouraging our people to press on  with\r\n\r\nthe efforts of building national cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of the motion standing in the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper contains chilling accounts of the\r\n\r\nterrorist  brotherhood in Singapore and  Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nIt   details   how  the  detainees  were  recruited   and\r\n\r\nmotivated.  It speaks of links that are global.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe brotherhood may be better organised and financed than\r\n\r\nthe communist clandestine cells of the past.  There are a\r\n\r\nfew  elements in the Paper that are worth emphasising  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can see whether the proposed measures are indeed\r\n\r\nsufficient to counter the threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as the Minister has mentioned, we are not\r\n\r\nonly  dealing  with a local problem, but a  regional  and\r\n\r\nindeed  a  global one.  The links that the JI brotherhood\r\n\r\nhas  with  other  groups in Malaysia, Indonesia  and  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  are well developed, and may even  be  closer\r\n\r\nthan those existing among the law enforcement agencies in\r\n\r\nthose countries.  If we do not look beyond our shores  in\r\n\r\ncountering  this threat, we would not be  addressing  the\r\n\r\nproblem  convincingly.  Any counter-measure that we  take\r\n\r\nshould also have a regional dimension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a volatile and highly dangerous\r\n\r\nmixture  of  religious obligation coupled with  political\r\n\r\nobjectives.   The  White Paper notes  that  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nobjective  of  the JI is to create a Daulah Islamiyah  in\r\n\r\nthe region through the use of violence.  There is no room\r\n\r\nfor  a  secular state in the region.  Indeed,  there  may\r\n\r\nalso  be  no room for religious toleration and the  like,\r\n\r\nunlike,  for  example, the Pancasila of Indonesia,  which\r\n\r\ndoes provide for belief in one supreme God, but which had\r\n\r\nbeen interpreted rather liberally, to allow for religious\r\n\r\nfreedom.   The plan is therefore ambitious, as  it  would\r\n\r\ninclude Indonesia, Malaysia, south Philippines, Singapore\r\n\r\nand Brunei.  This is a scary thought, especially for non-Muslims.   If  such a belief were to take root,  it  will\r\n\r\ncause  much misunderstanding and mistrust between Muslims\r\n\r\nand   non-Muslims  or,  worse,  creating  a  culture   of\r\n\r\nrepudiation among\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  various races and religions.  Again, we  should  see\r\n\r\nwhat  regional initiatives there must be to counter  such\r\n\r\nan objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is the clear acceptance by the\r\n\r\ndetainees  that religion precedes every other value  they\r\n\r\nhave.   The  obligation to be law-abiding is subordinated\r\n\r\nto  the religious obligation to perform the tasks set out\r\n\r\nby  their leaders.  Spiritual compulsion is, as we  know,\r\n\r\nmore powerful than any other compulsion.  The promise  of\r\n\r\na  better afterlife or the threat of being regarded as an\r\n\r\ninfidel, have worked to convince the unsure and the faint-hearted  to  accept  the  tasks  that  are  illegal   and\r\n\r\ndangerous.  It also allows those who follow this path  to\r\n\r\nreconcile  their  having to kill or otherwise  disrupt  a\r\n\r\nsociety  that  had  given  them  prosperity  and   peace.\r\n\r\nReligious  fanaticism is really what we are dealing  with\r\n\r\nand what we will have to deal with in the future.  Are we\r\n\r\nready to deal with this phenomenon?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to the JI arrests in December 2001 and\r\n\r\nAugust  2002,  the  likelihood of a terrorist  attack  in\r\n\r\nSingapore was far from most Singaporeans' minds.  Indeed,\r\n\r\neven  after  the  arrests  more recently,  several  young\r\n\r\npeople  I  spoke to, including university students,  said\r\n\r\nthey did not think that the terrorist threat here is real\r\n\r\nand  serious.   Many felt that the police and  other  law\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies are capable enough to nip such plans\r\n\r\nin  the bud.  New York and Bali-type attacks, they  said,\r\n\r\nwere most unlikely to occur.  This is praise for the  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies,  but I do  not  think  that  their\r\n\r\nattitude  is  one we want to encourage.  I  was  actually\r\n\r\nreally  taken  aback  when one even suggested  that  when\r\n\r\nthere  is actually an attack, they will then sit  up  and\r\n\r\ntake  notice.  Obviously, much more must be done to bring\r\n\r\nthe reality of the threat home to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such indifference and complacency are real,\r\n\r\ndangerous  and serious.  If we want public vigilance  and\r\n\r\nsupport, we need to bring home to the general public  the\r\n\r\nreal and present danger of terrorism in Singapore and the\r\n\r\nregion.   What steps should be taken to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare more alert and vigilant?  I understand that a booklet\r\n\r\nwill be published in February to alert the public on  how\r\n\r\nto  react  if they see suspicious packages or  the  like.\r\n\r\nBut  if  they are not conscious of this problem, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  help, even if we distribute the booklet to  all  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds  in Singapore.  Of course, at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  public  must not be unduly alarmed.  Otherwise,  the\r\n\r\ndrain on the security resources will be even more.  But I\r\n\r\nthink that the current situation requires some attention,\r\n\r\nsome  moves  by  the  Government and by  other  community\r\n\r\nleaders  to make the general public much more aware  that\r\n\r\nthe threat is real and serious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper states that it is important to\r\n\r\ncheck  divisive  misgivings and  suspicions  between  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  and  the non-Muslims.  It refers to  the  recent\r\n\r\nformation  of  Inter-Racial Confidence  Circles  and  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Code  of  Religious  Harmony.   These  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, good and necessary.  But I do not think that they\r\n\r\nwould  be enough.  The White Paper on the Maintenance  of\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony  published in 1989  pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nthere  are two fundamental conditions for social  harmony\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  First, that all practising religions must\r\n\r\nexercise  moderation and tolerance,  and  do  nothing  to\r\n\r\ncause religious enmity and hatred.  Second, religion  and\r\n\r\npolitics must be kept rigorously separate.  If we look at\r\n\r\nwhat has been done so far, I think it has more to do with\r\n\r\nthe first condition than with the second.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the second condition is even more\r\n\r\nimportant  and pertinent in the fight against  terrorism.\r\n\r\nBringing religion into the realm of politics has been the\r\n\r\ncause  of  much civil strife and wars in the world  since\r\n\r\nancient  and  medieval  times.   There  are  many  modern\r\n\r\nexamples  in other countries, such as the IRA in Britain,\r\n\r\nthe  MILF  in  the  Philippines, and the  Chechen  rebels\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the separation of religion and state is\r\n\r\nimportant in this current debate.  We need to take  steps\r\n\r\nto develop a strong belief in the people - all the people\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  a secular state is not just good but necessary  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's survival.  How should this be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be clear guidance on the political\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  particularly of  Muslims  in  a  secular\r\n\r\nsociety.  The separation of religion from politics has to\r\n\r\nbe emphasised.  In this regard, I refer especially to the\r\n\r\njoint statement by the hon. Malay Muslim Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse where they emphasised the need for Muslims to stand\r\n\r\ntogether  against  belligerent theology,  and  to  eschew\r\n\r\nviolence.  This statement, together with others  made  by\r\n\r\nMUIS and other Muslim religious and community leaders, is\r\n\r\na  clear  signal  to the general Muslim  population  that\r\n\r\nthere must be a separation between religion and politics.\r\n\r\nMixing  the two is, in this context, like mixing  Molotov\r\n\r\ncocktails in a multi-racial, multi-religious country like\r\n\r\nours.   It  is an extremely explosive mixture that  could\r\n\r\nonly  harm.   How do we ensure that there is this  strict\r\n\r\ndivision between religion and politics?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been noted by many scholars that this is not\r\n\r\neasy  in  Muslim communities, especially those living  in\r\n\r\nthe West.  The problem is that Islamic jurisprudence does\r\n\r\nnot recognise secular law as superior to that of the Holy\r\n\r\nLaw.  According to scholars, militant Islam also does not\r\n\r\nrecognise the state as an independent object of  loyalty.\r\n\r\nThis  is  evident  from the views  expressed  by  the  JI\r\n\r\ndetainees   as   to  why  they  see  that   violence   is\r\n\r\njustifiable, even when they are living in a peaceful  and\r\n\r\nprosperous  society.  They have a culture of repudiation,\r\n\r\nfuelled  by  being  in  the minority  in  many  of  these\r\n\r\nsocieties.    They   felt  isolated,   disenchanted   and\r\n\r\nrejected.   We  should be aware that such feelings  among\r\n\r\nthe  young would provide a fertile recruitment ground for\r\n\r\nthe militant leaders intent on changing the status quo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been mention in several public statements\r\n\r\nby  MUIS  and other Muslim leaders that there must  be  a\r\n\r\nmonitoring and revision of religious\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  in madrasahs and mosques, so that  belligerent\r\n\r\nand deviant Islamic thought that detracts from Islam as a\r\n\r\npious and moderate religion is filtered out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to suggest, in addition, that there\r\n\r\nmust be a more concretised and centralised approach, such\r\n\r\nas a code of political responsibility perhaps to be added\r\n\r\nto the Code of Religious Harmony, and that this code must\r\n\r\nstate  and  maintain clearly the principle of  separation\r\n\r\nbetween  state and religion.  I believe that reading  the\r\n\r\nstatement  by the Malay-Muslim Members of this House,  it\r\n\r\nis  clear  that  their intention is  to  promote  such  a\r\n\r\ndistinction,  but  it  is  necessary  to  translate  this\r\n\r\nstatement of intention into something concrete  that  can\r\n\r\nbe a guide to the general public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having such a code, I believe, we can inculcate\r\n\r\nsuch  values, especially in the young, so that they  will\r\n\r\nlearn  to live harmoniously in a secular society, without\r\n\r\nsacrificing or compromising their religious beliefs.   We\r\n\r\ncan  even  incorporate such principles in social  studies\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in schools and colleges.  Here, I am  talking\r\n\r\nnot just about Muslims, but all people of all faiths.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  live in a secular society in Singapore,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that we can do so, recognising the clear separation\r\n\r\nbetween state and religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes many disturbing features\r\n\r\nof  the extensive regional terrorist network in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia,  of  which the JI network in Singapore is but  one.\r\n\r\nIn  the ASEAN region, different elements of the terrorist\r\n\r\nnetwork  operate in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  the Philippines.  From all accounts, these are  more\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  bigger  and better-funded and  better-trained\r\n\r\nthan  Singapore's JI groups.  Some, like the Moro Islamic\r\n\r\nLiberation  Front  in the Philippines, have  secessionist\r\n\r\naims,  and  claim to be fighting for independence.   They\r\n\r\nhave  fought against regular troops and managed  to  keep\r\n\r\nthem  at  bay.  Such well-established regional  terrorist\r\n\r\norganisations  will have great influence,  if  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear from the White Paper that a\r\n\r\nregional  initiative is needed, not just for the security\r\n\r\nforces  of  the  region to combine and  act  on  regional\r\n\r\nterrorism,   but  also  for  governments  and  mainstream\r\n\r\ntheological  institutions  to  control  the   spread   of\r\n\r\nmilitant  ideology among the millions of Muslims  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  Not only must our chief Islamic leaders denounce\r\n\r\ndeviant  teachings  that  spread the  terrorist  message,\r\n\r\ntheir  counterparts in Malaysia or Indonesia have  to  do\r\n\r\nthe same.  Controlling the influx of foreign preachers to\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  just one of the ways mentioned.   However,\r\n\r\ngiven  today's  easy accessibility to foreign  resources,\r\n\r\nespecially  from  the Internet, it is  very  likely  that\r\n\r\nmilitant and deviant teachings could be obtained  without\r\n\r\nmuch difficulty, if they were available elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should the mainstream and moderate Islamic\r\n\r\nleaders  in  the  region  act  in  concert  and  denounce\r\n\r\nmilitant  interpretations of the religion, it will  be  a\r\n\r\npowerful force to counter the spread of terrorism in this\r\n\r\nregion.   Should we therefore not work towards getting  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration from the major Islamic leaders in  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  to  condemn  belligerent  deviant   forms   or\r\n\r\ninterpretations of Islam?  That would send a clear signal\r\n\r\nnot  just to local Muslims, but also to everyone else  in\r\n\r\nthe  world that ASEAN, and Singapore, are keen to  combat\r\n\r\nterrorism.  As the Minister has mentioned, this  will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  help also improve the confidence not just  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  but  of people visiting the region and  business\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe  White  Paper has also pointed out that there  was  a\r\n\r\nsharing  of information among security agencies  in  each\r\n\r\ncountry.   Of  course,  this must  be  strengthened.   If\r\n\r\nterrorists know that there is a strong coordination among\r\n\r\nASEAN  governments to share information and intelligence,\r\n\r\nof  course, it will make it much more difficult for  them\r\n\r\nto infiltrate and create trouble.  But, perhaps we should\r\n\r\ndo  more than just sharing of information - there  should\r\n\r\nbe an attempt to set up joint operations to fight against\r\n\r\nterrorism, if that has not already been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, we must strengthen our society to\r\n\r\nstifle  the  threat of terrorism in Singapore.   It  will\r\n\r\ntake  all that the White Paper recommends, and more.   It\r\n\r\nwill  take  broader  measures, such  as  providing  equal\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  all  in all  sectors,  educating  our\r\n\r\npeople,  especially the young, on the  correct  political\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  separation of state  and  religion,  and\r\n\r\npursuing   a  strong  regional  approach  to  fight   the\r\n\r\nterrorists  on one united front.  In the final  analysis,\r\n\r\nthis  debate is not just really about terrorism or public\r\n\r\nsecurity,  it  is  a matter that deals  with  fundamental\r\n\r\nquestions  of  how we organise, grow, and survive,  as  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,  multi-religious society in  this  troubled\r\n\r\nregion and the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  October  1987,  whilst many others  were  financially\r\n\r\ndislocated by the mighty Wall Street crash, my family and\r\n\r\nI  had  an  experience  of the terrestrial  kind  in  Los\r\n\r\nAngeles.  In a matter of days, we were shaken by a mighty\r\n\r\nearthquake  that measured 6 on the Richter  scale,  along\r\n\r\nwith  several equally earth-shaking aftershocks.   I  can\r\n\r\nstill  recall  vividly  the  sight  of  the  refrigerator\r\n\r\nswaying to and fro with each roll of the earth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earthquake experience left an indelible mark on\r\n\r\nour   lives,  as  we  suddenly  realised  that  we   were\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  something that could  inflict  widespread\r\n\r\ndamage,  and  the  occurrence  of  which  could  not   be\r\n\r\naccurately predicted nor prevented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every kid, down to my son who was in preschool\r\n\r\nthen, was taught what earthquakes were and what steps  to\r\n\r\ntake when the earth shook, such as getting underneath the\r\n\r\ntable, running out into open spaces.  I also marvelled at\r\n\r\nhow the local residents responded and rallied around each\r\n\r\nother.   They were not intimidated by the damage  that  a\r\n\r\nnasty  earthquake could wreak, but they carried on  their\r\n\r\nlives,   fully  aware  that  they  could  face   personal\r\n\r\nadversity when it happened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, everyone saw the earthquake for what it\r\n\r\nwas,   paid  attention  to  the  possibilities   of   its\r\n\r\noccurrences,  and  was  psychologically  prepared.    The\r\n\r\nlocal  government obviously sprang into action  when  the\r\n\r\nearthquake  did  strike,  but they  did  not  act  alone.\r\n\r\nPeople were ready and responded without panic despite the\r\n\r\nwidespread damage to the highways and personal property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have used the analogy of the earthquake to\r\n\r\nurge all Singaporeans to take a personal interest in  the\r\n\r\nterrorist threat, that is both real and serious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countering terrorism is every Singaporean's\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  We have built this nation from virtually\r\n\r\nnothing.  We have achieved this precious level of  racial\r\n\r\nand  religious  harmony with a lot of effort.   We  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  as  the Minister had urged,  jealously  guard\r\n\r\nwhat we have as Singaporeans.  It is not enough that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  actively mounting efforts to  prevent  or\r\n\r\nensure preparedness because, like that for an earthquake,\r\n\r\nno amount of preparation can insulate us from the effects\r\n\r\nof terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the earthquake, terrorism is not a natural\r\n\r\ndisaster.   Terrorism  is  a  deliberate  act   of   man,\r\n\r\ninvolving violent action for political purpose, according\r\n\r\nto the Cambridge International English Dictionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may debate on whether we agree with this\r\n\r\ndefinition.   Regardless  of the purpose  for  terrorism,\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean must try to see terrorism for what  it\r\n\r\ntruly is.  We must not be taken in by what it purports to\r\n\r\nbe, for example, that it is the result or the ambition of\r\n\r\na  particular race or religion, which is being suppressed\r\n\r\nor  oppressed.   Sir,  terrorism is terrorism,  pure  and\r\n\r\nsimple, and when undertaken in Singapore, attacks us as a\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, not only must every Member of this House\r\n\r\nsupport  the motion, but also must every Singaporean  who\r\n\r\ncares\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore  and  who  treasures  the  cohesion  and\r\n\r\nharmony  that  we have painstakingly built  up  over  all\r\n\r\nthese years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our greatest defence against terrorism is a\r\n\r\ncohesive people.  Every Singaporean, regardless  of  age,\r\n\r\nrace  or  religion, has a responsibility  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that we are not intimidated by terrorist\r\n\r\nthreats or acts, extensive or inhumane, though they  are.\r\n\r\nWe  will not allow ourselves to be cowed into living  our\r\n\r\nlives in dread and fear;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that we will not be misled by what these\r\n\r\nacts  pretend  to be.  We must be clear and mindful  that\r\n\r\nterrorism  proponents  frequently attempt  to  masquerade\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  champions for  a  religious  cause.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Jemaah Islamiyah group portrays itself as an\r\n\r\nIslamic organisation.  We must always ask ourselves  what\r\n\r\nthe true motive could be, differentiate carefully and not\r\n\r\njump  to conclusions, as in this case, to wrongly  assume\r\n\r\nthat all Muslims are somehow involved;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that we will instead be vigilant and quick\r\n\r\nto  dismiss any suggestion or speculation that  there  is\r\n\r\nfriction between the different racial or religious groups\r\n\r\nwhich has given rise to acts of aggression; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that we will act as one people, by\r\n\r\nconsciously  reaching  out to each other  towards  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  trust, and  by  rallying  behind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment against terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to echo my colleagues' sentiments\r\n\r\nand suggest that the Government pay special attention  to\r\n\r\neducating  the  young on what terrorism is,  and  how  to\r\n\r\nrespond to threats or acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I carried out a straw poll on the\r\n\r\nrecipients  of  the Edusave awards and saw many  clueless\r\n\r\nfaces  as  I  asked how many of them were  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nterrorist threats.  Many have little association to,  nor\r\n\r\nappreciation for, what terrorism can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentail.   I  believe it is vital for them  to  have  some\r\n\r\nperspective,  hard though it may be to  explain  some  of\r\n\r\nthese serious issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have witnessed in many countries how the\r\n\r\ndifferent  racial  and religious groups  barely  tolerate\r\n\r\neach other and how palpable the lack of trust and harmony\r\n\r\nis.   Singapore is truly different, but our current level\r\n\r\nof social cohesion does not happen by chance.  We have to\r\n\r\nwork  at  it.   Whilst  the Government  clearly  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for   macro  planning   for   countering\r\n\r\nterrorism,  it is in every Singaporean's interest  to  do\r\n\r\nhis  utmost  to  preserve the precious aspects  of  being\r\n\r\nSingaporean.   In this regard, I would like  to  urge  my\r\n\r\nfellow Chinese Singaporeans to reach out even more, so as\r\n\r\nto  increase our appreciation for the other cultures  and\r\n\r\nreligions.  As the majority racial group in Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  the responsibility to ensure that we keep  out  any\r\n\r\ndivisive attempts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I register my full support for the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

And\r\n\r\nthis  debate on the White Paper also provides us with  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to discuss in a frank and open, yet\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsensitive   way,  our  inter-racial  and  inter-religious\r\n\r\nrelationship  and  especially  how  we  can  manage   the\r\n\r\nrealities  on  the ground so that, over the longer  term,\r\n\r\nthere  is  greater  mutual respect  and  more  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence in each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist threat is not just a local\r\n\r\nproblem but a complex global problem with deep roots  and\r\n\r\ndriven by forces beyond Singapore.  We must deal with  it\r\n\r\nquickly as one united people and in a careful way so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  strengthen  our  social cohesion  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the terrorist threat stems from the\r\n\r\nextremist ideology of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)  members,\r\n\r\nthe  contribution of each community  -  Muslim  and  non-Muslim   -   will  make  a  big difference  on  how  this\r\n\r\nterrorist  threat  can be effectively  checked.   Let  me\r\n\r\nfirst deal with the contribution of our Muslim community.\r\n\r\nOur  Muslim religious and community leaders have and they\r\n\r\nmust  continue to lead the way and remain steadfast in  a\r\n\r\nfirm  and unequivocal condemnation of radicalism and  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  violence.  We have to show that we are  strongly\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  a  moderate approach in the  way  that  we\r\n\r\npractise Islam, which is a religion of peace and harmony.\r\n\r\nIt  must be clear that we are not in sympathy with groups\r\n\r\nor individuals who advocate terror and violence.  We must\r\n\r\nalso show that we are committed to Singapore and be ready\r\n\r\nto   reach   out  to  other  Singaporeans  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nfriendship and understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on their part, non-Muslim Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nalso  a  crucial  part  to  play  by  not  allowing   any\r\n\r\nmisperceptions  arising from the  JI  episode  to  affect\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude towards the Muslims.  We are also shocked\r\n\r\nand  disappointed by the disclosure of the JI  operations\r\n\r\nand  that  some  Muslim Singaporeans are  involved  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign-led  terrorists plot which, if successful,  would\r\n\r\nnot  only seriously hurt our fellow Singaporeans but also\r\n\r\nseverely harm our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the JI, as the White Paper has pointed out, is\r\n\r\na small group of misguided\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividuals  and the arrests have severely  curbed  their\r\n\r\nability  to  do  damage,  but it is  imperative  that  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to remain alert and vigilant and certainly  not\r\n\r\nbe   complacent.   The  statement  made  by  the   Muslim\r\n\r\nreligious  and  community  leaders  representing  various\r\n\r\norganisations  and mosques, which was issued  before  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of  the White Paper, condemning the JI  and  its\r\n\r\nviolent   agenda,  should  provide  the  assurance   that\r\n\r\nextremism and hatred have no place in Islam.  We must not\r\n\r\nlet  the JI episode divide us.  If we do so, we will,  by\r\n\r\ndefault,  fall  into  their  trap  to  create  chaos  and\r\n\r\ndistrust.   Here, the concern is more on the relationship\r\n\r\nat  the ground level.  The statements made by the leaders\r\n\r\nof the various non-Muslim communities are positive.  Many\r\n\r\nof them are in the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCC)\r\n\r\nin  all  our  constituencies and their contribution  will\r\n\r\nhelp  enhance  confidence-building  among  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Malay MP colleagues have had many\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  the  leaders  of  the  various  Muslim\r\n\r\norganisations  like the Muslim Religious Council  (MUIS),\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Islamic Scholars and  Religious  Teachers\r\n\r\nAssociation  (Pergas),  MENDAKI,  AMP  and  many   others\r\n\r\nincluding  the  mosque leaders on this issue.   They  had\r\n\r\nissued   statements  condemning  JI  and  its   extremist\r\n\r\nideology.   We  have  now to move  beyond  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nstatements to concrete actions to ensure that our Muslims\r\n\r\nwill  not  be easily influenced by the ideology of  those\r\n\r\nwho preach radicalism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has pointed out that for a\r\n\r\nbroad-based  approach  to  this problem,  the  Government\r\n\r\nrequires the cooperation of the Muslim community and also\r\n\r\nthe wider community of all Singaporeans.  The White Paper\r\n\r\nhas   proposed  that  the  Muslim  community  develop   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive,   self-regulatory   system   to    monitor\r\n\r\nreligious  education. MUIS, Pergas and also Perdaus  have\r\n\r\nissued  statements  on  proposals  to  improve  religious\r\n\r\neducation and they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to  ensure that Muslims are taught correct  Islamic\r\n\r\nvalues  of  moderation, tolerance and mutual respect  and\r\n\r\nare not easily misled into extremist teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS has pointed out in its statement that\r\n\r\nthere  is  the MUIS-Pergas Joint Committee to  facilitate\r\n\r\ninformation sharing and to synergise activities  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  religious  teachers.   Pergas,  in   its\r\n\r\nstatement,  wants  to  \"effectively prevent  the  general\r\n\r\nmasses   from   being   misled  into  following   deviant\r\n\r\nideologues\".   However, in this age of the  Internet,  we\r\n\r\nhave  also  to  guard  against  extremist  ideology   and\r\n\r\nthinking which can be imported into our homes and  living\r\n\r\nrooms.   We cannot be insulated from the developments  in\r\n\r\nthe Middle East and the Muslim world.  While we empathise\r\n\r\nwith  the  sufferings  of Muslims  elsewhere,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ncondone  extremism  and the use of violence.   There  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  injustices against Muslims elsewhere  but  this\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that we should tolerate extremism and  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  violence.  Therefore, I would like to  reiterate\r\n\r\nthat in the fight against terrorism, the Muslim community\r\n\r\nmust take a clear and unequivocal stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there are some issues which the\r\n\r\ncommunity would like to see early resolution, but here we\r\n\r\nare  facing a serious threat of terrorism and  to  combat\r\n\r\nthis  threat effectively, we must be united and  strongly\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  Singapore.  There may be problems  but  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  Singaporeans feel secure  to  enhance  mutual\r\n\r\ntrust  and confidence.  We must understand that there  is\r\n\r\nno  easy  solution  and certainly no quick-fix  solution.\r\n\r\nThe  JI  episode shows that the understanding and harmony\r\n\r\nthat we have built carefully over many years can suddenly\r\n\r\ncome  under  threat.   However, if Singaporeans  practise\r\n\r\nmutual respect and moderation in their daily interactions\r\n\r\nwith   their   fellow  workers,  neighbours   and   other\r\n\r\nresidents,  we  can  look  forward  confidently  and   be\r\n\r\noptimistic that we can, in the future, work on  good  and\r\n\r\nappropriate solutions in terms of our social context,  to\r\n\r\nsolve any issue or problem that we encounter today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also imperative that the Muslim religious\r\n\r\nand  community leaders move forward together to  urgently\r\n\r\naddress  other pressing issues that plague the community,\r\n\r\nlike  improving  the  educational achievements  of  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents and minimising the social ills in the community.\r\n\r\nWe  must move relentlessly forward to develop a community\r\n\r\nof   excellence.    As   our   community   enhances   our\r\n\r\ncontribution to Singapore's progress in this increasingly\r\n\r\ncompetitive  world, we will help make  Singapore  a  more\r\n\r\nsecure and happy place for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our discussions with the members of the\r\n\r\nMalay  community, many of them have repeatedly  expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  anxiety  that  they may  face  difficulty  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplaces,  especially as our businesses restructure  to\r\n\r\nboost  their competitiveness.  They and especially  those\r\n\r\nseeking  employment fear that their employment  prospects\r\n\r\nwill be adversely affected because of the JI episode  and\r\n\r\nthe  chilling account in the White Paper.  I  think  they\r\n\r\nfeel  stressed  and insecure.  They would  like  to  see,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  some form of assurance at the workplace  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  no  discrimination  based  on  race  or\r\n\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay MPs have met leaders of the Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of Commerce and Industry and also other  leaders\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  clans and organisations who  understand\r\n\r\nthese  concerns  and are ready to help  to  dispel  these\r\n\r\nfears.  We must ensure that employability is always based\r\n\r\non merit, ability, skills and work attitudes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, we face a serious threat which can\r\n\r\ndestroy the peace and harmony that we now enjoy.  We  are\r\n\r\nfortunate that our security agencies have been alert  and\r\n\r\ndecisive and the arrests have severely disrupted  the  JI\r\n\r\nbefore  they can do any damage to our society.   But  the\r\n\r\ndanger is far from being over, and we must continue to be\r\n\r\nalert and vigilant.  Above all, we must continue to  make\r\n\r\nmoderation  a part of our daily lives and strengthen  our\r\n\r\ntrust and confidence in one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THREAT OF TERRORISM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the past year have shown that we are\r\n\r\nnot immune from the phenomenon of radicalisation of parts\r\n\r\nof Muslim societies throughout the world.  As I say that,\r\n\r\nlet me make one point absolutely clear.  We must not fall\r\n\r\ninto  the pattern of thinking that radicalisation  has  a\r\n\r\nspecial  association with Islam.  All religions and  many\r\n\r\nsocieties  have their extremists.  They all  abuse  their\r\n\r\nreligions and societies.  For us now, however, the  White\r\n\r\nPaper raises the issue of threats to our society posed by\r\n\r\nsome  in the name of Islam.  How do we as a society react\r\n\r\nto  this?   We consider that one has to bear in mind  the\r\n\r\nrealities, and those realities are that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is little we can do about the wave of\r\n\r\nradicalisation  that  is sweeping through  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld, including Islamic societies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) We are not in a position to alter the policies of\r\n\r\nlarger  countries,  some of which  are  questionable  and\r\n\r\nwhich  are understandably causing deep frustration and  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  impotence  among many Muslims  throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld and catalysing them into reacting.  These reactions\r\n\r\nare  being  tapped  into by some leaders  for  thoroughly\r\n\r\nsickening ends.  There is little we can do about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) These global forces and ideas will certainly\r\n\r\nimpact on our Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what do we do? Do we sit back suspicious of our\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans and harbouring silent resentment?  Or\r\n\r\ndo  we  pretend that everything is all right, nothing  is\r\n\r\nhappening,  and that life can carry on as it always  has?\r\n\r\nNeither  of these are sensible options.  The only  option\r\n\r\nwhich   is  in  the  enlightened  self-interest  of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is to reach across racial lines  and  build\r\n\r\nties  that  bind  us  more closely while  increasing  our\r\n\r\nsecurity measures.\r\n\r\nThere  is a need to build stronger ties because,  at  the\r\n\r\nend of the day, the battle is for the mind.  Do we win or\r\n\r\ndo  the  terrorists win the ideological battle?    If  we\r\n\r\nwin,  we  cut  terrorism from its base.  One factor  that\r\n\r\nwill determine the fate of the ideological battle is  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  our inter-racial ties.  And  while  I  talk\r\n\r\nabout  victory, we have to recognise that the  battle  is\r\n\r\nnot  easy  and there can probably be no complete victory.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not possible to always or easily triumph for  our\r\n\r\nbeliefs  based on fate, but we must try.  We have,  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety,  always  tried to increase the strength  of  our\r\n\r\ninter-racial ties.  But I think the circumstances are now\r\n\r\nmore  opportune than they have been for  a  while  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand that, we have to look at two periods,\r\n\r\npre-September 11, and post-September 11.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-September 11, I felt that the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the races was moving in the right direction,  but\r\n\r\nthe  movement  was  slow.  In particular,  there  were  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  psychological  barriers  between  our  Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of reasons for this. I will\r\n\r\ndeal with two.  First, in our competitive society, by and\r\n\r\nlarge, our Muslim Singaporeans have done less well.  That\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  some defensiveness.  Second, I think,  it  was\r\n\r\ningrained  in  the psyche of many, though not  all,  non-Muslim  Singaporeans that somehow our Muslim Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere less competitive, and less able.  These feelings and\r\n\r\nreactions  were reinforced by the relative insularity  of\r\n\r\nthe  lives which many Singaporeans lead.  Those who  were\r\n\r\ninvolved\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  community  work and had to reach across racial  lines\r\n\r\ncould  overcome such reactions.  But not  many  had  such\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim Singaporeans, of course, picked up on\r\n\r\nthose  feelings.  And our Muslim Singapore society  stood\r\n\r\nfeeling  that it was not adequately respected by sections\r\n\r\nof  Singaporean society.  I would add that these are only\r\n\r\nmy  personal  views, and others may  well  disagree.   We\r\n\r\ncannot prove or disprove these things.  We can only  look\r\n\r\nstraight into our hearts and minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that for these and other reasons, there\r\n\r\nwas  a degree of resentment among Muslim Singaporeans and\r\n\r\na reaffirmation of links within the Muslim society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say all this, I do accept that, in formal\r\n\r\nterms,   we   have  done  most  things  correctly.    The\r\n\r\nConstitution  provides  for  equality,  and  we  practise\r\n\r\nmeritocracy,  sometimes almost brutally.   But  societies\r\n\r\nare   not  built  on  such  formal  institutions   alone.\r\n\r\nFeelings and attitudes are also important.  And  at  that\r\n\r\nlevel,  my  view is that many of our Muslim  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndid  not  quite  feel that they were  being  accepted  as\r\n\r\nequals.   I  believe that we have done better  than  many\r\n\r\ncountries which have a mixed racial composition.  But the\r\n\r\nfault lines and differences are still there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that these factors contributed to the\r\n\r\npsychological barriers that I have referred to.  It  was,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  difficult  to get Malay  participation  in\r\n\r\ncommunity   activities   proportionate   to   our   Malay\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since September 11th, and more particularly\r\n\r\nsince  the  JI arrests, there appears to be a  change  in\r\n\r\nmood both among Muslim and non-Muslim Singaporeans.  Many\r\n\r\nof  our  Muslim Singaporeans appear to have been  shocked\r\n\r\ninto reacting.  They want to make the point that they are\r\n\r\nloyal  Singaporeans.  There is greater  openness.   Malay\r\n\r\norganisations have come forward to denounce extremism and\r\n\r\nterrorism.  Highly symbolic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvisits are being made to places of worship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, what should non-Muslim Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndo?  We have a serious opportunity to rejig the attitudes\r\n\r\nthat  are  developing.  We have to show, with  sincerity,\r\n\r\nthat  we  respect  and value our Muslim Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nthat  we want to build deep links.  Our own mindsets have\r\n\r\nto  change.  We must treat our Muslim Singaporeans in our\r\n\r\nheart  of hearts with respect.  We must show empathy  for\r\n\r\ntheir problems but that must not mutate into disrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk about reaction here, I do not mean the\r\n\r\nreaction  of  political leadership, both Malay  and  non-Malay.   At  the  level  of the community  and  political\r\n\r\nleadership,  the  issues  have  been  understood.   I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  reaction of the Singaporeans  in  the\r\n\r\nstreet.   And  the  situation arises because  unlike  the\r\n\r\nleadership, for most Singaporeans, the opportunities  and\r\n\r\nneed  for  interacting closely and  with  empathy  across\r\n\r\nracial  lines  are  limited.   We,  therefore,  need   an\r\n\r\nattitudinal  change in all Singaporeans, both  Malay  and\r\n\r\nnon-Malay.    If  Singaporeans  react  to  Malay   under-performance by saying, \"Well, the Malays are less clever,\r\n\r\nand  it  is a Malay problem, which we will leave  to  the\r\n\r\nMalays  to sort out,\"  then we will quickly set into  old\r\n\r\npatterns.  We will lose the opportunity that the  present\r\n\r\nmood  has  created.  And we will increase  divisions  and\r\n\r\nallow  the  ideologies sweeping the world now to  have  a\r\n\r\ngreater influence on Muslim Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans also have a duty now to react in\r\n\r\na  way  which  will encourage closer ties.  For  example,\r\n\r\nover  the years, practices have developed, which many  of\r\n\r\nus  have observed, which differentiate rather than  bring\r\n\r\nus  together,  and  these should be relooked  at  by  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singapore  community.  And all Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nthink about this carefully.  There has to be a whole  new\r\n\r\nenergy  in engaging across racial lines.  It is not  easy\r\n\r\nfor  a  deep-seated attitudinal change to take  place  in\r\n\r\nsociety  as a whole.  But that change must be  an  ideal,\r\n\r\nand leaders\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave a duty to try and make a change in that direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would make two other points. For too long now,\r\n\r\ntoo  many  subjects have been taboo, if  they  appear  to\r\n\r\ntouch  upon religious practices.  But freedom to practise\r\n\r\na  religion should not mean a total ban on discussion  of\r\n\r\npractices   which  may  hinder  a  healthy,  economically\r\n\r\nproductive life and active citizenry, particularly  where\r\n\r\nthese practices impact on others in society.  We need  to\r\n\r\nmove  towards accepting debate in areas which affect  our\r\n\r\nsocial  togetherness, even if this touches on aspects  of\r\n\r\nreligious  behaviour.  The leaders of  all  religions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  encourage debates in  specific  areas,\r\n\r\nalbeit the debate has to be handled sensibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is a fact that our Malay Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  been  performing better and better in many  fields.\r\n\r\nBut we need to catalyse that progress in the interest  of\r\n\r\na  stable  and  inclusive society.   It  is  in  all  our\r\n\r\ninterest  that there are Malay icons of success, wherever\r\n\r\npossible.  The official policy is meritocracy and  it  is\r\n\r\nheresy  to  suggest anything else.  But I will be  mildly\r\n\r\nheretical.    There   must   be  opportunities,   without\r\n\r\naffecting the core principle of meritocracy, for there to\r\n\r\nbe some form of action which will see Malays in important\r\n\r\npositions in greater numbers than they are now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because while the improvements shown by\r\n\r\nstatistics are important, it is necessary to put a  human\r\n\r\ntouch to success.  Successful role models offer hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, initially, there could be a feeling that a\r\n\r\nperson  owes  his  position more to  his  race  than  his\r\n\r\nability.  But provided that he or she is, in fact,  able,\r\n\r\nand   the  principle  of  meritocracy  is  not  seriously\r\n\r\nprejudiced,   these   doubts  can  be   overcome.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  this  will give considerable  psychological\r\n\r\nboost to the rest of the Malay society, and the way  non-Malays perceive Malays will also change faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this does not mean that overnight, the issue\r\n\r\nof the impact  -  both positive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  negative  -  of ideas fermenting in Muslim societies\r\n\r\nacross   the  world  on  our  Muslim  Singaporeans   will\r\n\r\ndisappear.  We are dealing with ideological issues  which\r\n\r\nhave  great power.  But I think these steps will help  in\r\n\r\nameliorating  the negative impact, at least  among  those\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans who have a moderate outlook.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say this, I will also say this to our Malay\r\n\r\nSingaporeans:  be  realistic.  Do not  push  beyond  what\r\n\r\nsociety as a whole can accept.  For example, I think  the\r\n\r\nwhole  issue  of Malays in the SAF is a red herring.   Do\r\n\r\nnot  make that the litmus test for success.  It makes for\r\n\r\ngood  political sound bite but is otherwise  meaningless.\r\n\r\nLook   at  successful  minority  communities  and   other\r\n\r\nsocieties.   Their  success is  based  upon  educational,\r\n\r\ncultural   and  economic  achievements,  not  how    many\r\n\r\nGenerals  they  have.  The issue of Malay performance  in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF is one which really the Malay society should put\r\n\r\non  the back burner.  The issue can be taken further only\r\n\r\nat the rate at which the whole society feels comfortable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, terrorism in all its forms must be condemned.\r\n\r\nIn order to starve terrorists of their potential base, we\r\n\r\nhave to build a socially inclusive society.  And I end my\r\n\r\nspeech  by saying that we have, I think, a serious window\r\n\r\nof  opportunity  to  move decisively  to  build  stronger\r\n\r\nlinkages among all Singaporeans.  For the sake of our and\r\n\r\nour  children's future, I hope that we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nseize that opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the motion in the name of the  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scourge of terrorism affects every nation in the\r\n\r\nworld.   Even the superpower countries, like the USA  and\r\n\r\nRussia, are not free from terrorist attacks.  There  were\r\n\r\nterrible  terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center  in\r\n\r\nthe USA, the Moscow Theatre in Russia, the blowing up  of\r\n\r\nthe  American Embassy building in Nairobi, Kenya, and the\r\n\r\nrecent bombings in Bali.  Thousands of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninnocent lives have been lost to those dastardly attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist threats to Singapore are real and serious.\r\n\r\nNo  civilised  country in the world is  immune  from  the\r\n\r\nattacks of terrorists.  Singapore is no exception.   With\r\n\r\nthe  infiltration of the militant Jemaah Islamiyah groups\r\n\r\ninto Singapore from Indonesia, Singapore shall always  be\r\n\r\nin  danger  of  terrorist  attacks.   Singapore  must  do\r\n\r\neverything it can to defend itself.  Although our present\r\n\r\nsituation  is not as serious as that of Israel,  we  must\r\n\r\nlearn  from Israel's example.  Every man, woman and child\r\n\r\nin  Israel  is  taught to be alert  and  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nidentify possible dangers posed by terrorists.  I have an\r\n\r\nIsraeli  friend who visited Singapore.  I took him  to  a\r\n\r\nshopping   complex.   On  entering   the   building,   he\r\n\r\nimmediately  pointed out to me the plastic  shopping  bag\r\n\r\nthat was lying on the floor and the rubbish bin that  was\r\n\r\nnot emptied.  He said that those items carelessly left in\r\n\r\nour shopping complex would not be allowed to be similarly\r\n\r\nleft  in a building in Israel for fear that bombs may  be\r\n\r\nplanted  in  them.  I hope that we too in  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nreally  be on such an alert situation.  I hope  that  all\r\n\r\nterrorist  infiltrators that come  to  Singapore  can  be\r\n\r\nnabbed  in  time and not be given a chance to  plant  any\r\n\r\nbombs  in  our midst.  Should even a single  bomb,  which\r\n\r\nescapes detection, go off is one too many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1960s, a terrorist bomb went off. It was\r\n\r\nduring the time of confrontation with Indonesia.  At that\r\n\r\ntime,  I  was  purchasing a book at  a  bookstore  called\r\n\r\nMarican  & Sons at Orchard Road.  The building  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  bookstore was situated had since been demolished  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a hotel.  The bomb went off in the building  known\r\n\r\nas  MacDonald House, about 400 yards from where I  stood.\r\n\r\nEven  at that distance, I could hear the loud blast,  and\r\n\r\nthe  doors of the shop shook.  I believe a bank  employee\r\n\r\nwas killed in that explosion.  Of course, the planting of\r\n\r\nthat  bomb was utterly senseless.  There was no strategic\r\n\r\nimportance in that building which was mainly  used  as  a\r\n\r\nbank at that time.  Then, that was the way the terrorists\r\n\r\noperated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other incident which I would like to recall was\r\n\r\nalso  in the 1960s, also during the Confrontation period.\r\n\r\nLuckily  for me, that bomb planted by terrorists  at  the\r\n\r\nbeach  at Katong did not go off; otherwise, I may not  be\r\n\r\nstanding here today.  On that night, I was sleeping in  a\r\n\r\nroom in a block of flats situated about 10-15 metres from\r\n\r\nwhere  the bomb was placed.  My room was facing the beach\r\n\r\nwhere the bomb was planted.  I was told later that it was\r\n\r\na  25-pounder and that if it had gone off, the whole wall\r\n\r\nof  the  building facing the beach would have been  blown\r\n\r\noff.   I  think  I would have been killed by  the  blast.\r\n\r\nSuch  is the devastation that could be wrecked by  a  25-pounder.  I am just wondering what havoc would have  been\r\n\r\nwrought   with   a  bomb  comprising  several   tons   of\r\n\r\nexplosives, which was reported that the Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\nmembers were trying to purchase and make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Singapore must be vigilant. We must not allow\r\n\r\neven  one  bomb to go off in our country.  I support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  firm action taken against  members  of  the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah.   My  party, the Singapore  Democratic\r\n\r\nAlliance  (SDA),  welcomes the Government's  decision  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  White Paper on the  JI  detentions.   The\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  provides  the  factual  background  to  the\r\n\r\ndetentions and show how appropriate the Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct  is in dealing with threats to national security.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with the Government that counter measures must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  against  the terrorist threats.   Terrorists  have\r\n\r\ninternational  connections.   The  JI  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nconnections  with  outsiders which have an  international\r\n\r\ncharacter.   It  is therefore only right  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nseeks  the  assistance  of other countries  in  combating\r\n\r\nterrorism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards promoting cohesion and religious harmony,\r\n\r\nmy party hopes that, with the discussion of the issues in\r\n\r\nthe   White  Paper,  Singaporeans  can  understand   that\r\n\r\nincreased  religiosity  need  not  necessarily  lead   to\r\n\r\nreligious  militancy.  The SDA urges  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  all  avenues  to increase religious  and  racial\r\n\r\ntolerance so that Singaporeans can strengthen the  social\r\n\r\nfabric.  In this way,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  achieve social cohesiveness  with  the\r\n\r\nability  to  identify and reject ideology  that  preaches\r\n\r\nviolence and extreme hatred.  The SDA also hopes that the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  whilst taking care of the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority, does not neglect the interests of the  minority\r\n\r\nor  simply brush aside, especially the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nminority that concern the practice of their religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nmotion  standing  in the name of the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 9/11 was a turning point in the history of the\r\n\r\nworld.   It  changed our lives.  It changed  the  world's\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic landscape.  Some  however  still\r\n\r\nthought  that  New York was far, far away from  us.   And\r\n\r\nAfghanistan  and Al-Qaeda were deemed to be distant  from\r\n\r\nour shores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Singaporeans had a rude awakening when the JI\r\n\r\nnetwork in Singapore was uncovered and 15 JI members were\r\n\r\narrested  in December 2001.  In the following  year,  any\r\n\r\nlingering  doubts about JI network and terrorist  threats\r\n\r\nevaporated with the Bali bomb blasts of October 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it in perspective, the Al-Qaeda and JI\r\n\r\nfanaticism and terrorism were brewing for quite a  while.\r\n\r\nIt  took  them many years of painstaking preparation  and\r\n\r\nindoctrination.   Most striking was the  global  coverage\r\n\r\nand  the  fanatical zeal of the terrorists.  But by  now,\r\n\r\nall  know that this new wave of fanatical terrorism could\r\n\r\nstrike  anywhere, any time.  And the problem will not  go\r\n\r\naway  overnight.   It is a severe and  long-term  problem\r\n\r\nthat  will  persist and trouble us over a long period  of\r\n\r\ntime.   To counter, therefore, and overcome this problem,\r\n\r\nwe  require  and must have clear vision, right  strategy,\r\n\r\nunwavering   determination,   patience,   fortitude   and\r\n\r\ninternal cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seeds of such religious fanaticism have\r\n\r\nbeen sown in the Middle East and Afghanistan.  Funded and\r\n\r\nfuelled by petrol dollars of the Middle East, it spread\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  rest of the world.  Singapore, as a  small  city\r\n\r\nstate,  is  not immune from world currents and  terrorist\r\n\r\nthreats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may ask, in this context, why another JI\r\n\r\nreport,  bringing it up again and again.  There  is  some\r\n\r\nunease  that  this is given another airing.   But  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  that we discuss and address this terrorist threat\r\n\r\nopenly, rather than sweep it under the carpet and pretend\r\n\r\nthat  all  is  well.  We should brainstorm,  find  common\r\n\r\nground and forge a united and effective counter strategy.\r\n\r\nIn  this way, I trust we will gain insights and a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the issues involved.  I am sure we  will\r\n\r\nemerge  from  the debate stronger, as one united  people,\r\n\r\none united nation of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, we have to reassess and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre  fast  to stay afloat in these troubled  times.\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that we face an elusive enemy who is\r\n\r\nprepared  to die for a cause, including suicide  bombing,\r\n\r\nif  necessary.  This is not conventional war but a battle\r\n\r\nfor  the  hearts and minds of the people.  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen fortunate so far in escaping from JI bomb blast.  We\r\n\r\nhave  managed  to  nip the problem in the  bud  with  the\r\n\r\ntimely  arrests of the JI members.  We must  commend  and\r\n\r\nthank  the  ISD,  the  police and the  SAF  for  doing  a\r\n\r\nwonderful   job   in   safeguarding  our   security   and\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our peace.  Bravo, and well  done!   We  are\r\n\r\nthankful for your services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that we are insulated\r\n\r\nfrom terrorist threats or that no bombs will ever go  off\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   No  one can guarantee that  a  terrorist\r\n\r\nattack will not occur.  All we can do is to take all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary preventive measures and prepare for the  worst,\r\n\r\nwhile  hoping  for  the best.  If  you  think  about  it,\r\n\r\nSingapore  could  well be very high on  the  list  of  JI\r\n\r\ntargets  in  the  region, given our  strong  support  for\r\n\r\ncounter-terrorism  and  our very  success  in  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures so far.  Indeed, the JI network is extensive  in\r\n\r\nthe region, spreading and straddling Singapore, Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Philippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive and counter measures must therefore also\r\n\r\nbe  regional  in scope.  This means that the  authorities\r\n\r\nand  the security agencies in the region must pull  their\r\n\r\nresources together, share intelligence and have a unified\r\n\r\nand  integrated  counter strategy.  No  country  in  this\r\n\r\nregion  should  allow their territory to  be  used  as  a\r\n\r\ntraining  ground, sanctuary, or breeding ground  for  the\r\n\r\nterrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our neighbours should realise that the terrorists\r\n\r\nare  our  common  enemy.  If we  do  not  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nextremists in our midst, they will undermine and  destroy\r\n\r\nthe governments in the region, one by one.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to the governments in the region to sink whatever\r\n\r\ndifferences  they have, to work in tandem and  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis clear and present terrorist threat.  There is indeed\r\n\r\nno other way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this White Paper gives an interesting insight\r\n\r\ninto  the profile of the JI detainees.  They have average\r\n\r\nand   above  average  intelligence,  and  received   good\r\n\r\neducation,  some  with polytechnic and college  diplomas.\r\n\r\nMost  of  them have good jobs, including appointments  as\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  technicians.  Clearly,  these  JI  members\r\n\r\nembarked on their misadventures not out of deprivation or\r\n\r\nsocial unrest.  Why then did they do all this?  They were\r\n\r\ndefinitely manipulated by extremists out to make mischief\r\n\r\nand out to capitalise on religious fanaticism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JI members were not the mainstream of our Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore.  Indeed, they isolated themselves\r\n\r\nfrom  the  main  Muslim organisations  and  indoctrinated\r\n\r\ntheir  members in cells with their own brand of militancy\r\n\r\nand their own lingo, including what they call \"JI-speak\".\r\n\r\nThe JI tactics sought to drive a wedge between the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  other Singaporeans.   From  the  national\r\n\r\nperspective, therefore, one must ask: how can the JI  and\r\n\r\nthe larger Al-Qaeda threat be neutralised in ways that do\r\n\r\nnot alienate the Singaporean Muslim community?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, first, there is a need to provide timely\r\n\r\ninformation so as to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevent unhealthy misconception from forming.  Certainly,\r\n\r\nin  the  current  context  of  the  counter-terrorism  in\r\n\r\ngeneral, and the JI arrests in particular, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been  forthcoming in explaining the issues  and  the\r\n\r\nmedia  is  playing the role in educating members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Information on arrests of the JI members  under\r\n\r\nthe ISA, for example, has been made readily available  so\r\n\r\nas to prevent popular misconceptions developing about the\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  the  detainees.   Family  members  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees  have  visited the detainees  to  inquire  into\r\n\r\ntheir well-being and the ISA Advisory Board members  have\r\n\r\nreviewed their cases individually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the White Paper, there is the publication of\r\n\r\nthe  booklet on the Internal Security Act, giving  useful\r\n\r\ninformation  on  the rationale of the  legislation,  past\r\n\r\ninstances in which terrorists or subversive elements have\r\n\r\nthreatened Singapore, and the conditions under which  the\r\n\r\nAct may be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to anticipate and prevent\r\n\r\nany   misconception  that  the  religious  faith   of   a\r\n\r\nparticular  community  is under attack.   There  must  be\r\n\r\ntrust  and confidence that the Government is even handed,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  treats all  racial  and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups in Singapore fairly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that the\r\n\r\nGovernment acts in the national interests, in a fair, non-discriminating  and consistent manner,  without  fear  or\r\n\r\nfavour.   But the promotion of trust and bonding  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  job  of the Government alone.  Singaporeans  of  all\r\n\r\nwalks of life must and should play their part in ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  all  communities live and work together in harmony.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should interact with their neighbours,  make\r\n\r\nthem  feel  at  ease  and  at  home.   In  this  context,\r\n\r\nemployers   should   not   consciously   or   unknowingly\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against  Muslims, and  ordinary  non-Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   should  not  treat  their  Muslim   fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens  differently.  Otherwise, the  Muslim  community\r\n\r\nmay   feel   out  of  sync  with  the  rest  of  society.\r\n\r\nIndividual Muslims would then become vulnerable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto those who whisper that their interests are best served\r\n\r\nby throwing in their lot with the likes of JI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, I believe we can do more to promote\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  bonding,  particularly  in  the   HDB\r\n\r\nheartland.  If neighbours in the estates know each  other\r\n\r\npersonally and meet in block parties and other  community\r\n\r\nevents,  the  likelihood is, if there is a  flare  up  or\r\n\r\nincident, we could talk to each other, we could call each\r\n\r\nother, and goodwill, common sense and peace will prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the IRCC is a step in the\r\n\r\nright  direction.   We should do all things  possible  to\r\n\r\nmake all races feel that they are all part and parcel  of\r\n\r\nthe  community.  For example, we should ensure that halal\r\n\r\nfood is provided in community functions and some barbecue\r\n\r\npits are reserved for Muslim residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a need for modern Muslim leaders to\r\n\r\nproactively forestall attempts by fringe elements to shun\r\n\r\nthem  aside and radicalise the community.  We should  not\r\n\r\nforget  that in early 2002, Zulfikar of Fateha.com sought\r\n\r\nto  project  himself  as the true leader  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nMuslims by engaging in a publicity campaign, accusing the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  being  anti-Islamic.   Fortunately,   the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community rejected Zulfikar's claims, and settled\r\n\r\nthe  issue.  However, other extremists will try again and\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, against the wider backdrop of counter-terrorism, it is incumbent upon moderate Muslim\r\n\r\norganisations    and   leaders   to    closely    monitor\r\n\r\ndevelopments,      anticipate     possible      political\r\n\r\ncontingencies, and resolutely act to forestall  extremist\r\n\r\nattempts to exploit certain issues.  Moderate members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community should speak up.  Otherwise,  there\r\n\r\nwill be a vacuum, which would be exploited by extremists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that Singaporean\r\n\r\nMuslims  are well aware of the dangers posed  by  the  JI\r\n\r\nterrorists,  and  they  want  to  have  no  part  in  the\r\n\r\nmisplaced and misguided JI aims and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntactics.   We are encouraged that more and more  moderate\r\n\r\nand  fair-minded Muslim leaders and members are  speaking\r\n\r\nup   against  JI  and  terrorism,  and  standing  up  for\r\n\r\nmoderation and tolerance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Religious Harmony Code Committee has been\r\n\r\nvisiting  and  having  dialogues with  various  religious\r\n\r\ngroups.   What  struck me, as a member of the  committee,\r\n\r\nwas that though these various religious groups uphold and\r\n\r\npractise  their own religions, there is a  common  desire\r\n\r\nfor  moderation,  tolerance and religious  harmony.   All\r\n\r\ngroups  know that we are better off together in  our  own\r\n\r\ncountry than apart or adrift.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moderation and tolerance work well for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  should  continue  to  build  upon   this\r\n\r\nfoundation  and  further  enhance  religious  and  racial\r\n\r\nharmony.   We must not forget that united we  stand,  and\r\n\r\ndivided we fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, terrorism can only be eliminated\r\n\r\nif the ideological basis can be removed and their funding\r\n\r\nthrough  petro-dollars is stopped.  The  road  ahead  for\r\n\r\ncounter-terrorism  is  going  to  be  long  and  arduous.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have to be patient as we  wait  for  bigger\r\n\r\nforces to work it out in the world at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we should focus on the immediate\r\n\r\nproblem,  marshal our resources to deal with the problem,\r\n\r\nsummon our will as one united people, regardless of race,\r\n\r\nlanguage  or  religion,  marching  together  shoulder-to-shoulder  to overcome the threat.  We can do it together.\r\n\r\nFor it is only as one people that we can succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on the Jemaah Islamiyah arrests\r\n\r\ndescribed very clearly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe threat of terrorism to the security of Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nwant to highlight three priorities today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must thoroughly expose their plot. Let us\r\n\r\nshine  a  bright  light onto their dark methods  and  let\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   see  through  their  ploy,  because   when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  see through their ploy,  it  will  be  much\r\n\r\nharder for their schemes to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must tell Singaporeans how terrorism\r\n\r\ncosts them dearly, even if bombs have not gone off.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  make  sure that Singaporeans are  not  complacent\r\n\r\nabout the threat or its impact, and are motivated to  act\r\n\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must give our strongest support to efforts\r\n\r\nby  the  Muslim  leadership to  fortify  their  community\r\n\r\nagainst   spiritual  hijacking  by  deviant  groups   and\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Prevention is much better than cure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the JI is part of a conspiracy to overthrow the\r\n\r\ngovernments of the region and to seize political control.\r\n\r\nJI members who are Singaporeans have forgotten their duty\r\n\r\nand  obligation to their country.  Instead, they connived\r\n\r\nwith  the  Al-Qaeda and other terrorist  groups  to  harm\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Singaporeans.  They willingly operated  as\r\n\r\nthe  fifth column for international terrorism, being  the\r\n\r\ninternal spies and operatives for these external  groups.\r\n\r\nThey  planned  to  bomb places and kill innocent  people.\r\n\r\nAnd we all know that they had plans to build those bombs,\r\n\r\nand they almost succeeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they get people to join them? The JI\r\n\r\ndeliberately scouted for and systematically indoctrinated\r\n\r\nunsuspecting   Muslim  believers  into  their   ways   of\r\n\r\nthinking.  These perpetrators are particularly dangerous,\r\n\r\nbecause they abuse the power and authority of religion to\r\n\r\ndeceive   the  faithful  into  sympathising  with   their\r\n\r\ncriminal  cause,  and  to  do  their  bidding.   This  is\r\n\r\nspiritual manipulation of the most devious kind, and  for\r\n\r\nthe most heinous ends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a technique of exploitation reminds me of the\r\n\r\nbehaviour of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncuckoo  bird.  The female cuckoo purposely seeks out  the\r\n\r\nnest  of another species of bird in which to lay her egg.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo's egg resembles closely the look of the egg of\r\n\r\nthe  victim's species.  So, when the parent bird from the\r\n\r\nvictim's  species leaves its nest unattended, the  female\r\n\r\ncuckoo  flies  in and removes one of the  victim's  eggs,\r\n\r\nlays   one   of  its  own,  and  flies  off  before   the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting victim returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim flies back to the nest - not knowing what\r\n\r\nhas  happened  - and incubates the cuckoo  egg,  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  it was one of its own.  That egg belonging  to  the\r\n\r\ncuckoo usually hatches before the victim's own eggs,  and\r\n\r\nonce  that nestling hatches, it pushes out the other eggs\r\n\r\nfrom  the  nest, so that it can get all the food  brought\r\n\r\nback  by  the foster parents.  So, this young  cuckoo  is\r\n\r\nfed, cared for, and protected by the victim, and actually\r\n\r\ngrows to be several times larger than the foster parents.\r\n\r\nAll  the  while, the foster parents never suspected  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  exhausting  themselves  harbouring,  feeding,\r\n\r\nprotecting  the  very  enemy that had  killed  all  their\r\n\r\nyoung.  In due course, that cuckoo grows up, flies off to\r\n\r\nfind the next set of victims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quoted this analogy because I want to point\r\n\r\nout  the importance of exposing such spiritual hijacking.\r\n\r\nThe Muslim community in Singapore must not let the JI  or\r\n\r\nany  other  group masquerade as one of  its  own,  to  be\r\n\r\nsheltered and nurtured.  They must not let this JI cuckoo\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, we must tell Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  although  we  have prevented a  physical  terrorist\r\n\r\nattack  so far, there is already a cost economically  and\r\n\r\nsocially.   And  Singaporeans are paying  for  that  with\r\n\r\ntheir jobs and with their future prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, the plans and actions of the JI and\r\n\r\ntheir  Al-Qaeda  masters have added more uncertainty  and\r\n\r\ngloom  to  doing  business  in Southeast  Asia.   Foreign\r\n\r\ndirect investments and tourism revenues in the region are\r\n\r\ntwo clear and big victims of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when we talk about foreign direct\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  tourism  revenues  and  the  impact  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  on  them,  it  may  not  be  obvious  to  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that  we  are actually  talking  about  the\r\n\r\nthreat on jobs and livelihood of workers, their prospects\r\n\r\nand  what  they bring home to their families.  Jobs  have\r\n\r\nbeen  lost,  and  many  jobs  made  less  secure  because\r\n\r\nterrorism   is  scaring  away  investors,  business   and\r\n\r\ntourists  from  the region, and that includes  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo,  thanks to groups like the JI, Singaporeans will have\r\n\r\nan  even  harder  time looking for  jobs  in  an  already\r\n\r\ndifficult economic period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the cuckoo nestling that pushes eggs out\r\n\r\nof the nest, the JI's actions have pushed jobs out of the\r\n\r\neconomy - jobs that unemployed Singaporeans of all  races\r\n\r\nand religions need and would treasure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially, the false claims by the JI that they are\r\n\r\nacting according to the precepts of Islam have tarred the\r\n\r\nimage  of the Muslim community.  Those who are less aware\r\n\r\nmay  come  away having the wrong impressions about  Islam\r\n\r\nand   about  Muslims.   Some  others,  whether  they  are\r\n\r\ncompanies  or individuals, may start feeling uneasy,  and\r\n\r\nbecome  cagey  in  their interaction  and  dealings  with\r\n\r\nMuslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we deal with these challenges wrongly, the strong\r\n\r\ntrust,  mutual  respect and tolerance that the  different\r\n\r\nraces  and  religions have so painstakingly  forged  over\r\n\r\nmany years will be undermined.  Social cohesion will then\r\n\r\nsuffer.   If  social cohesion suffers, who wins?   Nobody\r\n\r\nwins,  except those who see the destruction of our multi-racial,  multi-religious  and  meritocratic  society   as\r\n\r\nserving their purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who loses? Every peace-loving, fair-minded,\r\n\r\nlevel-headed, loyal Singaporean, regardless  of  race  or\r\n\r\nreligion.   For,  when  social  cohesion  and  trust  are\r\n\r\nweakened,  order  is  hard to maintain.   Without  order,\r\n\r\nthere  cannot be development.  Without development, there\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  jobs.   Without  jobs,  Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nsuffer.  The better life will become a pipe dream.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, if you are a Muslim worker applying for a\r\n\r\njob, you will want fair consideration to be given to your\r\n\r\napplication  on  the basis of merit,  and  not  become  a\r\n\r\nvictim of possible stereotyping that might arise from the\r\n\r\nJI's  claim  that it is Muslim.  And that  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nright,  because what the JI did is not your  fault.   And\r\n\r\nthe  best  way  to  achieve this is by  actively  denying\r\n\r\ngroups like the JI the chance to misappropriate the  good\r\n\r\nname of Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally clearly, if you are a non-Muslim Singaporean\r\n\r\nlooking  for  work,  you  will hope  that  investors  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  will base their operations  here.   You  will\r\n\r\nhope  that  they expand their presence in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\noffer more jobs.  You will not want your chances to  find\r\n\r\na  job undercut by worries that businesses may have  over\r\n\r\nsecurity.   You have nothing to do with the  JI,  so  why\r\n\r\nshould  you  allow  them to harm your  chances  and  your\r\n\r\nprospects?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us be practical. It is in the collective\r\n\r\ninterest  of  all Singaporeans, regardless  of  race  and\r\n\r\nreligion,  to  stand together and fight these  terrorists\r\n\r\nand expose their lies.  If we do not, we will end up like\r\n\r\nthe eggs and nestling of the foster parent birds - pushed\r\n\r\nout  of  the nest to die - even though it was  not  their\r\n\r\nfault.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how we look at the issue, it boils\r\n\r\ndown to one fact: terrorism in general, and the dangerous\r\n\r\nmotives and actions of the JI in particular, have  harmed\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  Singapore  and  Singaporeans.   Their\r\n\r\nactions  and lies must be exposed.  I applaud the efforts\r\n\r\nof the Muslim community and its leaders to resolutely and\r\n\r\nrelentlessly  safeguard the good name of  their  religion\r\n\r\nfrom the perverted beliefs and behaviour of the JI.  This\r\n\r\nis absolutely critical for two reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it authoritatively clarifies in the minds of\r\n\r\nMuslim believers that the JI's claims to being Islamic in\r\n\r\nits  theology and practice are false.  This  removes  the\r\n\r\npsychological  hook that the JI has  been  using  to  tap\r\n\r\nsympathy from Muslim\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelievers.   And  it makes it easier  for  all  to  focus\r\n\r\nobjectively  on considering the threat of  terrorism  and\r\n\r\nits  implications, and not be deceived or swayed  by  the\r\n\r\nJI's cunning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, through leadership by example, the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore is sending  out  a  very  strong\r\n\r\nsignal that it has not been taken in by the wiles of  the\r\n\r\nJI, and will stand united with all other Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nfight this common threat to national peace, security  and\r\n\r\ninterest.   The community is showing that it will  always\r\n\r\nbe vigilant and will never allow itself to be made use of\r\n\r\nby  terrorism.   Such  signals are important  because  it\r\n\r\nindicates  that  Singaporeans,  regardless  of  race  and\r\n\r\nreligion, are rational, practical and united.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  shows to the world that it is safe to  invest\r\n\r\nand do business in Singapore, and to employ Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nA  safe,  united  and prosperous Singapore  is  our  best\r\n\r\nrebuff to terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as our Muslim countrymen take action to cut out\r\n\r\nthis  cancer,  I  call on all non-Muslim Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ngive  them  our fullest support.  They are undertaking  a\r\n\r\ncritical  and onerous task not only for the sake  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim   community,  but  for  the   benefit   of   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stay united, encourage one another, work\r\n\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder  with  one  another  and  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and rid our land of this threat of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nsome   Singaporeans  question  why  this  JI   issue   is\r\n\r\nresurrected.  They feel that a constant reminder  of  the\r\n\r\nissue  is bad for the morale of the Muslim community  and\r\n\r\nwould thwart inter-religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the response to this is found in limb (a) of\r\n\r\ntoday's  motion - that the terrorist threat is  real  and\r\n\r\nserious.  When we first had the arrests in December  2001\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 2002, the focus was on neutralising the JI itself.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the JI could impact our peace was not\r\n\r\nimmediately known.  We needed to know more about the JI's\r\n\r\nhistory,   ideology,   resources   and   network.     The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  findings indicate the  seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\nterrorist threat.  A debate allows all our people  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  aware of the nature of the threat.  It also enables\r\n\r\nthe  Government to have the benefit of public opinion  on\r\n\r\nhow to deal with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that many Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nrather   just  move  on  and  leave  this  issue  behind.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the terrorism issue is bound to rear  its  head\r\n\r\nagain in future as much of it is beyond our control.   It\r\n\r\nis  better for us to face the issue squarely, rather than\r\n\r\npretend it does not exist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the three-prong approach\r\n\r\nenunciated  in  the White Paper.  This approach  reflects\r\n\r\nour  acknowledgement that the terrorism threat cannot  be\r\n\r\nmanaged  as  a  security issue simpliciter.   The  multi-faceted  nature  of  the  threat  calls  for  an  equally\r\n\r\ncomprehensive response.  Sir, the security aspect of  the\r\n\r\nmatter cannot be over-emphasised but I would like just to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the second and third limbs of the above approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper suggests that the Muslim community\r\n\r\ndevelop a comprehensive self-regulatory system to monitor\r\n\r\nreligious  education.   Some  concerns  were  raised   by\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  in this  regard.   Some  people\r\n\r\nquestion, Sir, whether the community would be up  to  its\r\n\r\ntask.  This question springs from two assumptions.   One,\r\n\r\nthat the Muslim community may not have the resources; and\r\n\r\ntwo, that the Muslim community may not be firm enough  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with errant followers for fear of antagonising  the\r\n\r\ngreater Muslim community in Singapore and other parts  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards resources, it is not the duty of the\r\n\r\nMuslim community to deal with the whole terrorism threat.\r\n\r\nSelf-monitoring is only one of three pieces in  the  full\r\n\r\npicture.  Seen in that perspective, the resources\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired of the community is not so formidable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced, Sir, that the Muslim community would\r\n\r\nbe  resolute  in  its  task.  Since  the  first  arrests,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  community  had  declared  openly  their\r\n\r\nrejection of the JI and terrorism.  The most significant,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  was the stand made by 127 Muslim organisations,\r\n\r\nwho  unequivocally rejected the JI and  terrorism  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths  ago.   The  Muslim community finds  it  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest to safeguard itself against elements similar  to\r\n\r\nthe  JI,  cuckoo birds included.  If it has  to  do  with\r\n\r\nstricter  self-monitoring, it would do  so  with  genuine\r\n\r\nvigour.   Further, Sir, the Muslim community has received\r\n\r\nthe moral support of the other communities to act firmly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the committee to look into a proposed\r\n\r\nReligious Harmony Code met leaders from various religious\r\n\r\ngroups,  as mentioned by my colleague, Dr Ong, just  now.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  all  groups agree that there  is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nensure that religious enthusiasm does not get out of hand\r\n\r\nand  grow  into  bigotry or extremism.  This  concern  is\r\n\r\nshared  by  all  religious groups and  not  just  by  the\r\n\r\nMuslims.   As  such, the efforts by the Muslim  community\r\n\r\nwould  be  complemented by similar efforts made by  other\r\n\r\nreligious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pursuant to this White Paper, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs had announced the prime role of\r\n\r\nMUIS,  the  Islamic Religious Council  of  Singapore,  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the self-monitoring effort.  Some people  have\r\n\r\nraised  the  concern whether MUIS has the  capability  to\r\n\r\ncarry out the self-monitoring.  The issue here is whether\r\n\r\nMUIS  has the credibility to ensure compliance.  A letter\r\n\r\npublished on 14th January 2003 in the Forum page  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  stated \"MUIS already faces a  credibility\r\n\r\nproblem\".  The writer there stated that this was noted in\r\n\r\nan  earlier  article by Mr Mafoot Simon  in  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  on 12th January.  It was said that since  not  all\r\n\r\nmadrasahs follow the MUIS curriculum, it shows that  MUIS\r\n\r\nlacks credibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no institution can claim to have\r\n\r\ncomplete  adherence from all its constituents.  The  real\r\n\r\nissue  here is whether it has enough credibility to carry\r\n\r\nout its task effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3(2) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act\r\n\r\nprovides, among others, that it shall be the function and\r\n\r\nduty  of  MUIS  to advise the President of  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nmatters relating to the Muslim religion in Singapore;  to\r\n\r\nadminister  matters relating to the Muslim  religion  and\r\n\r\nMuslims  in Singapore; and to administer all mosques  and\r\n\r\nMuslim religious schools in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS has the legitimacy and authority in law to\r\n\r\nperform the duty to self-monitor religious teachings.  No\r\n\r\nother  organisation has an equal status.  The appointment\r\n\r\nto  the  MUIS  Council is through a  careful  process  as\r\n\r\nstipulated  in  section 7 of the Act.  Efforts  are  also\r\n\r\nmade  to ensure wide representation of the Muslim public.\r\n\r\nMUIS  Councils over the years usually comprise  respected\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders and organisation leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, MUIS has over time grown in terms of\r\n\r\nreputation   and   sophistication.   It  handles   mosque\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  manage  wakaf properties,  deals  with  Haj\r\n\r\nmatters, administers halal certification, overseas  zakat\r\n\r\nor  tithe  collection  and  distribution,  among  others.\r\n\r\nProblems  that  arise in relation to madrasah  curriculum\r\n\r\nshould not, in one go, strip MUIS of all its credibility.\r\n\r\nWe  have to be fair in our judgement.  The madrasah issue\r\n\r\ncan be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that, MUIS had announced that it\r\n\r\nwould form an Asatizah Group - asatizah is the plural  of\r\n\r\nustaz   or   religious  teachers  -  including  religious\r\n\r\nteachers  outside  MUIS, to discuss  contemporary  issues\r\n\r\nfacing  Islam  and  to help the self-monitoring  process.\r\n\r\nThis  announcement was published in the Berita Harian  on\r\n\r\n16th January 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, I refer to a statement made by\r\n\r\nPergas,  referred to by my colleague, Mayor Othman,  just\r\n\r\nnow,  which  was published also in the Berita  Harian  of\r\n\r\n16th  January.  The statement was in the Malay  language.\r\n\r\nIn  the  statement, Pergas reiterates its  commitment  to\r\n\r\nmaintain peace in our multi-religious country.  It states\r\n\r\nthat  monitoring  religious education  is  a  concern  of\r\n\r\nPergas and MUIS.  If further added at paragraph 17,  \"our\r\n\r\nefforts  -  \"our\" meaning Pergas' efforts - to strengthen\r\n\r\ncooperation with MUIS shall continue.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim community, either by itself, or\r\n\r\nthrough  MUIS, Pergas or other organisations,  shows  the\r\n\r\nresolve and resources to carry out this delicate task  of\r\n\r\nself-monitoring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another concern, in spite of numerous\r\n\r\nassurances to the contrary, whether the religion of Islam\r\n\r\nitself is the cause of the problem.  This worry was given\r\n\r\nprominent airing recently in the Straits Times dated 15th\r\n\r\nJanuary  in  a  commentary by Ms Chua  Lee  Hoong.   Some\r\n\r\npoints raised were:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The word \"Islam\" does not mean peace, but total\r\n\r\nsubmission to God in order to obtain security, as held by\r\n\r\nphilosopher Roger Scruton;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Ayatollah Khomeini said in 1984 that war was a\r\n\r\nblessing to the world, and men are commanded to wage  war\r\n\r\nand to kill, and such perverse logic continues to inspire\r\n\r\nyoung Muslims;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) There is a danger of the periphery moving into the\r\n\r\ncentre - so one Yazid Sufaat, who was supposed to  be  an\r\n\r\nengineer    upon   receiving   a   Malaysian   Government\r\n\r\nscholarship, instead returned as one who was involved  in\r\n\r\nboth September 11 and the Bali bombing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The Islamic ideological framework, \"taken to its\r\n\r\nlogical  conclusion denies any official compact with  the\r\n\r\nstate  and  regards secular authority by  definition,  as\r\n\r\nbeing without legitimacy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are extremely serious charges. My brief\r\n\r\nresponse is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Drs Imam Munawwir, \"Islam\" means both\r\n\r\npeace and submission.  According to Dr Quraish Shihad, he\r\n\r\ncommented that by knowing the meaning of the word \"Islam\"\r\n\r\na  person  would  know that it is a  religion  of  peace.\r\n\r\nWorld-renowned  scholar  Abdullah  Yusuf   Ali   in   his\r\n\r\ncommentary on the Quran elaborated on the six aspects  of\r\n\r\n\"peace\" and stated that these are shades of \"Islam\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second point, on killing - the statement made by\r\n\r\nAyatollah  Khomeini - there are verses in the Quran  that\r\n\r\nsay there is no compulsion in religion and the Prophet is\r\n\r\nreported to have said, \"He who is not merciful to  others\r\n\r\nwill   not  be  treated  mercifully\",  and  these  values\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  taught  in our  hundreds  of  religious\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Yazid Sufaat, I say, Sir, that thousands\r\n\r\nof  graduates  proceed  on to  be  of  service  to  their\r\n\r\nprofessions,  employers or governments.  Malaysia,  where\r\n\r\nYazid  stays,  may  have  its  own  peculiar  context  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  radicalism; but in Singapore  the  radicals\r\n\r\nremain in the periphery.  For instance, we noted from the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper that the JI believes that those  who  reject\r\n\r\ntheir  campaign  are infidels.  This  is  not  the  Islam\r\n\r\nunderstood by most Singapore Muslims.  Such ideas  remain\r\n\r\nin the periphery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (4), about the Islamic ideological\r\n\r\nframework,  I  beg  to disagree.  For  instance,  in  the\r\n\r\nTreaty  of Hudaibiya, which was signed by the Prophet  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of the Muslims in Medina and the Meccan  Quraish,\r\n\r\ncontained   several  terms,  more  of  which   were   not\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  the Muslims, but necessary  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsecure  peace.   The  Prophet ensured  that  the  Muslims\r\n\r\nhonoured its terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events such as this and many others form the corpus\r\n\r\nof  material  from  which Islamic  values  and  laws  are\r\n\r\nextracted.  They show that it is perfectly acceptable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Muslims  to  have  compacts, agreements,  with  non-Muslims,  be  they individuals, groups or  states.   Once\r\n\r\nmade,  these agreements are to be honoured even if it  is\r\n\r\nto the detriment of the Muslim party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quotes from Scruton or Ayatollah Khomeini\r\n\r\ndo  not  reflect the kind of Islam we have in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut   we   cannot   deny   that   there   are   different\r\n\r\ninterpretations of Islam, as there are of  any  religion.\r\n\r\nIt  is not for us to determine which is the true version.\r\n\r\nThe  crucial question for us is what is the stand of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans on such issues.  It is incumbent  on\r\n\r\nthe Muslim community to clarify its position.  It is also\r\n\r\nin  the  interest  of  all  of us,  all  communities,  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the position of the Muslim community  and  act\r\n\r\non them wisely\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore, Sir, had come out clearly\r\n\r\nagainst  JI and terrorism.  What about some of the  other\r\n\r\nissues  raised  by Ms Chua Lee Hoong?  The  Muslims  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to clarify them.  They have been grappling  with\r\n\r\nissues  pertaining  to Islam since the  community  itself\r\n\r\nexisted.  In the late 19th century, for instance,  Munsyi\r\n\r\nAbdullah  wrote about the issue of education  to  Muslims\r\n\r\nand  pondered why Muslims were weak in that aspect.  That\r\n\r\nissue  is still relevant today.  In some technical cases,\r\n\r\nissues such as whether the first day of Ramadan ought  to\r\n\r\nbe determined by sight or by calculations, were gradually\r\n\r\nresolved.  But not all issues are straightforward.   Some\r\n\r\nissues  get  more complex as the world progresses.   Some\r\n\r\nnew  issues  are  born  with the passage  of  time.   The\r\n\r\nemergence of radicalism, extremism and terrorism, as they\r\n\r\ncoincide  with religious revival, is a major  issue  that\r\n\r\nconfronts the Muslims today.  In this regard, the Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  realise that it has  to  do  some  serious\r\n\r\nintrospection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Berita Harian of 16th January, the Mufti's\r\n\r\nOffice  issued  a  statement on Religious  Guidance.   It\r\n\r\nstated among others:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) that Muslims have to objectively evaluate its\r\n\r\nrole in missionary work and religious education;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) missionaries must be keenly aware of current\r\n\r\nthoughts in our society;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the approach used to interact with society has to be\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewed;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) when dealing with contemporary issues, missionaries\r\n\r\nand  teachers  should use an approach that  is  open  and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Muslims have to appreciate the universal values\r\n\r\nin  Islam which is based on pristine faith, moral virtues\r\n\r\nand dynamic laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the above reflects the kind of\r\n\r\ncritical  self-analysis that underscores the  community's\r\n\r\npresent  and  future  efforts.  It is  not  one  that  is\r\n\r\ntotally  inward-looking, but one  which  also  emphasises\r\n\r\nactive participation in the larger society.  Let us  give\r\n\r\nthe Muslim community some space to formulate its position\r\n\r\ncalmly and thoroughly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring religious education, Sir, is a delicate\r\n\r\ntask.   It  is not quite completely a good idea  for  the\r\n\r\nreligious  education  of  a  certain  community   to   be\r\n\r\nmonitored by a group from a different religion or by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Self-regulation with an increased  awareness\r\n\r\nof the issues at hand is, in principle, the best way out.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, if anyone is to regulate and monitor the\r\n\r\nreligious  education of the Muslim  community  so  as  to\r\n\r\ndetect  extremist elements, the best people to do so  are\r\n\r\nthe Muslims themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans are keen to have the\r\n\r\nterrorist   threat   resolved   once   and    for    all.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is not always so simple.  As stated  in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper,  Singapore cannot eliminate  terrorism\r\n\r\ncompletely  and  by  itself.  In  spite  of  measures  to\r\n\r\nmonitor religious classes and enhance security, it is not\r\n\r\npossible, as stated earlier, to fully insulate ourselves.\r\n\r\nOn  the  contrary,  the flow of ideas and  people  across\r\n\r\nborders will increase.  It is not advisable for Singapore\r\n\r\nto cocoon itself from external influences.  The more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen  we  become,  the  more  open  we  are  to  possible\r\n\r\nterrorist  attacks,  ideologically  or  physically,  from\r\n\r\nwithin or without.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper correctly points out that groups\r\n\r\nlike   JI   can   undermine  inter-ethnic  harmony.    If\r\n\r\nunchecked,  inter-ethnic suspicions will breed  distrust,\r\n\r\nhatred and, eventually, enmity.  Therefore, steps have to\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  further strengthen inter-ethnic  cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe  establishment  of the IRCC and  the  drafting  of  a\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony Code are two concrete steps  mentioned\r\n\r\nin the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the nature of terrorism and\r\n\r\nextremism, we must continuously promote social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nSocial cohesion is not a one-off exercise.  It has to  be\r\n\r\nconsciously  kept  alive and current.  Some  people  feel\r\n\r\nthat   enhancing  inter-religious  harmony   like   self-regulation  means  further restraints on  religion.   The\r\n\r\nPresident  of  Pergas alluded to this  in  his  statement\r\n\r\nwhich  was  published  in  the  Berita  Harian   on  16th\r\n\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality is that our society has become more\r\n\r\nassertive.  We want more political space and more freedom\r\n\r\nof  expression.  Religious groups too are  becoming  more\r\n\r\naggressive  in their missionary work.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nour  island  has become more densely populated  and  more\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan.    There  is much greater  interface  among\r\n\r\npeoples  of various ethnic and religious persuasions  now\r\n\r\nthan  ever  before.  These trends are likely to continue.\r\n\r\nIn  such a scenario, heightening religious differences is\r\n\r\nbound to occur unless the different religious groups have\r\n\r\ndeveloped   among  themselves  that  degree   of   mutual\r\n\r\nconfidence  which  allows them  to  air  their  different\r\n\r\npositions  without  undermining the  common  peace.   So,\r\n\r\ninstead  of curbing religious expression, inter-religious\r\n\r\nharmony  is  meant  to  facilitate  greater  freedom   of\r\n\r\nreligious  expression.   It is in  the  interest  of  all\r\n\r\nreligious  groups to enhance inter-religious  confidence.\r\n\r\nThe    majority   of   Singaporeans   understand    this.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  also understand that there  can  be  little\r\n\r\nmeaningful  community or religious life if  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncollective peace\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the first place.  Again, in the Berita Harian of 16th\r\n\r\nJanuary, the Deputy Mufti was reported to have said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Asatizah group which MUIS intends to set  up  shall,\r\n\r\namong  others,  discuss  matters  to  enable  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity to enhance national integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I state that the terrorism\r\n\r\nthreat is real.  It has serious repercussions.  It cannot\r\n\r\nbe cured with a single operation.  Thus, acknowledging it\r\n\r\nthe  way  as  we  do now requires much courage  and  open\r\n\r\nheartedness.   Handling it is a long  drawn  affair  that\r\n\r\ndemands patience, sensitivity and diligence, and we  must\r\n\r\ndo it together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Chiam before me, I would like to state our\r\n\r\nparty's  position on this matter.  We share the  nation's\r\n\r\nconcern  on  the  threat  to our security  posed  by  the\r\n\r\nterrorist groups like the Jemaah Islamiyah.  We recognise\r\n\r\nthis  as a very serious threat to our social and economic\r\n\r\nwell  being,  and  support  the Government's  efforts  to\r\n\r\ncontain   them.   In  this  respect,  may  I   take   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to applaud the ISD on a job well  done.   For\r\n\r\nonce,  I am beginning to feel a bit more confident  about\r\n\r\nthe ISD  -  that is not used as a political tool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to see that the ISA is used in its proper\r\n\r\nintent,  arresting those who are out to harm the security\r\n\r\nand  stability of our beloved country, and those who  are\r\n\r\nbent  on  using  violence  as a means  to  achieve  their\r\n\r\nideological objectives.  We recognise that, as long as we\r\n\r\ntake  the  constitutional approach to challenge  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment, there should be no fear of such arrests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to take this opportunity to express my\r\n\r\nsupport  for the publication of this detailed and almost-comprehensive  White  Paper.  In future,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould make it a practice to issue a White\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper  following every major arrest using  the  ISA.   My\r\n\r\nonly  regret is that, when reading through the Report,  I\r\n\r\nfind  missing were copies of the Detention Orders  issued\r\n\r\nby the Home Affairs Minister.  They should be included in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  to convince the more skeptical  people\r\n\r\naround, the reasons for these arrests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests were of a very small group of extremist\r\n\r\nand    malevolent   radicals.    Although    some    were\r\n\r\npsychologically  pressured into participation,  they  are\r\n\r\nnot representative or symptomatic of the Muslim community\r\n\r\nat  large.  Thus, it is wise of us to differentiate  this\r\n\r\nJI  group  -  with  its  extremist ideology,  willing  to\r\n\r\nespouse violence to achieve their desired ends - from the\r\n\r\nfriendly and peace-loving Muslim community that  we  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  know and regard.  It is unfortunate  that  such\r\n\r\nthreats are coming from deviant groups claiming to act in\r\n\r\nthe name of religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also acknowledge the considerable\r\n\r\ncontributions  made  by the mainstream  Muslim  community\r\n\r\ntowards nation building and the sacrifices that they have\r\n\r\nmade -  living as a minority in our community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many Muslim religious and community leaders\r\n\r\ncoming  out  to denounce the JI and pledge allegiance  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  non-Muslim  community  cannot,  but   be\r\n\r\nassured  that the JI is an extreme group  -  rejected  by\r\n\r\ntheir  peers at large, and that Islam itself it  not  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  these  problems.  It is the  extreme  radicals\r\n\r\nbehind this group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean - whether Muslim or non-Muslim,\r\n\r\nwhether  pro-Government  or pro-Opposition  -  must  come\r\n\r\ntogether  in  this  to  support the  Government  and  its\r\n\r\nagencies in keeping peace, law and order.  In return, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  start paying more  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nwishes  and concerns of the various communities  and  not\r\n\r\ndismiss their concerns as slight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote Pergas in their press release, \"we (Pergas)\r\n\r\nare  worried that side issues, important to a  particular\r\n\r\ngroup because of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  religion,  are not receiving due  attention.\"   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  Government should stop questioning  the\r\n\r\nloyalty  of  the  Malays in Singapore.   It  should  move\r\n\r\nbeyond  race and help all citizens to focus and build  on\r\n\r\nthe   Singaporean  identity.   With  a  strong  Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity, there is less likelihood of our citizens  being\r\n\r\nhijacked  to  cause harm to our society   -   by  people,\r\n\r\ngroups or governments with a hidden agenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, I would like to express three\r\n\r\nconcerns that I have learnt from the White Paper.  First,\r\n\r\npage  26 of the Paper states that the first specific lead\r\n\r\ncame from a concerned Singaporean after the September  11\r\n\r\nattacks,  after  which  the investigation  and  operation\r\n\r\nagainst the JI started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had that particular Singaporean been less\r\n\r\ndiscerning,  less wise or less proactive, the Government,\r\n\r\nthe  ISD  and all Singaporeans would probably  have  been\r\n\r\nnone   the  wiser  until  after  an  actual  attack   had\r\n\r\nmaterialised  at the Yishun MRT station.  On  that  note,\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporean should be rewarded for  providing  that\r\n\r\nvital information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other than relying on concerned citizens to\r\n\r\nprovide  the leads, or information exchanges between  the\r\n\r\nother security agencies, can the Minister assure us  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  other means in place to track the  plans  and\r\n\r\nhappenings   of   these  known  and  other   unidentified\r\n\r\nterrorist groups.  And that such means are not used as  a\r\n\r\ntool by \"big brother\" to watch its peace-loving citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore is a very small and vulnerable\r\n\r\ncity  surrounded by water.  The Government  should  focus\r\n\r\nmore resources in making sure that external elements  are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  create havoc in Singapore  by  staging  an\r\n\r\nattack   from  countries  nearby.   As  we   stand   here\r\n\r\ncondemning  the terrorists, what assurance is there  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that  there  is no  plane,  hijacked  from\r\n\r\nairports nearby and flown towards this Parliament House?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I urge the Government not to jump to any\r\n\r\nhasty conclusions if our installations overseas are under\r\n\r\nattack  or destroyed, no matter the current state of  our\r\n\r\nrelationship.  There could be malicious elements  out  to\r\n\r\nsour our ties with our neighbours and create unrest.   As\r\n\r\nMinister Wong said earlier and quoted from page 11 of the\r\n\r\npaper,  which states that \"Hambali's plan was  to  attack\r\n\r\nkey Singapore installations and to represent them as acts\r\n\r\nof  aggression by the Malaysian government.\"  We must not\r\n\r\nfall into the trap of the terrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the\r\n\r\nrecommendations put forth by the paper.  The three  broad\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are sensible and practical  approach  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  problems  of  terrorism  associated   with\r\n\r\nreligion.  It should be supported and endorsed.  However,\r\n\r\nit  is not enough to will this problem away and there  is\r\n\r\nmore the Government can and should do to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government should learn to listen to the\r\n\r\nwishes and aspirations of the people.  Stop pretending to\r\n\r\nlisten  when  policy  decisions  are  already  made   and\r\n\r\njustified.  It is time for the Government to drop the \"We\r\n\r\nknow  better than you\" kind of attitude.  Such Government\r\n\r\nand  civil  service attitude results in frustrations  and\r\n\r\nresentments,  and does not help to build a more  cohesive\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government should encourage greater\r\n\r\ntransparency in its discourse.  Keeping the lid on public\r\n\r\ndiscussion  of  any issues serves only  to  perpetuate  a\r\n\r\nsocially and politically immature populace.  What fear is\r\n\r\nthere  in  finding a can of worms if the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen fair and vigilant in performing its duties?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I am very happy that this whole episode is\r\n\r\nbrought into spotlight by the issuance of the White Paper\r\n\r\nand  this thorough debate in this House.  We have a  very\r\n\r\nfragile  society, bound together, not by acceptance,  but\r\n\r\nby  tolerance.   Singaporeans  tolerate  each  other  not\r\n\r\nbecause they want to, but because they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed to, and are required by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot want to, because they are not\r\n\r\ncommunicating  and  not  understanding  each  other  well\r\n\r\nenough.  Other than through the newly set up IRCC,  there\r\n\r\nis  minimal  discussion  at the  inter-racial  or  inter-religious  levels.  The Government should not  be  afraid\r\n\r\nthat such discussions will lead to heightened tensions or\r\n\r\nracial disharmony, because it would not.  If we dare  not\r\n\r\ndiscuss  tough issues, we will be none the  poorer  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no discussions, no opportunity to speak\r\n\r\nup, heard and be heard, and not being able to raise one's\r\n\r\nconcerns  to  public consciousness, how can  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nlearn  of each other's aspirations and support each other\r\n\r\nto build a more cohesive society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer towards greater social cohesion is not to\r\n\r\nsegregate the different communities, but to get  them  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  more  closely  and frequently.   I  hope  this\r\n\r\nepisode   is  the  beginning  of  more  dialogues,   more\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and  more interactions to come  between  the\r\n\r\nvarious communities at the constituency level.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Government should practise what it\r\n\r\npreaches.   If  it  truly  believes  in  the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nreligion,  it  should  seriously  consider  allowing  the\r\n\r\npractice of some religious obligations in schools and the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.   This  is  especially  relevant  as  our\r\n\r\nsociety matures, and greater diversity and non-uniformity\r\n\r\nresults.  The Government must encourage and help to build\r\n\r\nunity  in the midst of diversity and make it one  of  our\r\n\r\ncore strengths of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible Opposition, we do not want to be\r\n\r\nseen  politicising national and internal security issues.\r\n\r\nWhat  is needed is to instill trust in one and all, at  a\r\n\r\ntime that is most needed for nation building and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion.  We would also urge the Government  not\r\n\r\nto  exploit  the current situation to its own  advantage,\r\n\r\nbut to move on to tackle the equally important problem of\r\n\r\nrising  unemployment.  We trust that the  Government  may\r\n\r\nhandle  this  economic problem with  the  same  zeal  and\r\n\r\nefficiency,  because  a discontented  populace  may  also\r\n\r\ndisrupt peace and security within the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  Cold War and the expansion  of  global\r\n\r\ncapitalism,  the  advancement  in  technology   and   the\r\n\r\nemergence  of a world-wide free market, the world  ushers\r\n\r\nin the age of globalisation.  Singapore, like most of the\r\n\r\nworld,  looks  forward to a peaceful  21st  century  with\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity.  The Asian financial crisis in  1997\r\n\r\nprovided  the  first wake-up call, and its  repercussions\r\n\r\nare still deeply felt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th September 2001, the world witnessed the\r\n\r\nreturn  of  an  intractable  conflict  in  the  form   of\r\n\r\nterrorism disguised in the name of Islam.  Tragic as  the\r\n\r\nNew  York  attacks  were, they seemed  remote  until  the\r\n\r\narrests  of  members of Jemaah Islamiyah in  December  of\r\n\r\nthat  year, and in August 2002.   We did not realise that\r\n\r\nwe  could  be  the victims of terrorism  as  well.   With\r\n\r\nevidence  disclosed  after  the  arrests  and  the   Bali\r\n\r\nbombings  in  October  2002,  we  have  to  accept   that\r\n\r\nterrorism is now a real and serious threat to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party has considered these developments\r\n\r\nin  the context of national and regional security and the\r\n\r\nwell-being of our people.  The Party has noted the change\r\n\r\nin the global political environment and the shift in geo-political  landscape.  We are of the view that Singapore,\r\n\r\nbeing  small  and  situated in a  sensitive  geographical\r\n\r\narena,  is vulnerable.  Terrorism poses a great challenge\r\n\r\nto  our  future.   Although the Workers' Party  disagrees\r\n\r\nwith the PAP Government in many areas, including the ISA,\r\n\r\nwe  feel  it is time that the nation should be united  to\r\n\r\nface the challenge of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Workers' Party supports the Government's  action  in\r\n\r\nthe  arrest of the JI members and the recommendations put\r\n\r\nforth  in  the White Paper.  Although the Government  has\r\n\r\nresponded  with  sensible recommendations  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, the problem of terrorism disguised in the name  of\r\n\r\nIslam  involves  deep emotions, which the recommendations\r\n\r\nmay not be able to fully address.  The Workers' Party  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the predicament facing some sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community, as a result of the JI arrests  and\r\n\r\nthe economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we are aware that some Muslims feel\r\n\r\nthat the Muslim community in Singapore is now put in  the\r\n\r\nspotlight  and Islam is portrayed in a bad light  by  the\r\n\r\nmedia.  It is obvious that terrorism in the name of Islam\r\n\r\ncannot  be  seen as Islam itself.  If the plan to  attack\r\n\r\nYishun  MRT station was successful, the victims could  be\r\n\r\nMuslims  as  well.   We  are sure that  the  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   are able to distinguish between  terrorism\r\n\r\nand Islam.  However, there are bound to be a small number\r\n\r\nof  people  who will over-react and embarrass our  fellow\r\n\r\nMuslims,   thereby   damaging  the  trust   between   the\r\n\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly urge the various ethnic communities, the\r\n\r\npublic,  the  employers  and  the  media,  and  even  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself, to be sensitive to the feelings of our\r\n\r\nMuslim  community and exercise restraint in  putting  the\r\n\r\ncommunity under the spotlight, when there is a need to go\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes the JI as a clandestine\r\n\r\norganisation  in  its  method of  recruitment  and  which\r\n\r\nfeatures  Islam  in  a  misguided  way  to  achieve   the\r\n\r\norganisation's ulterior motives.  However, we  also  need\r\n\r\nto  examine and identify where there are factors  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical,  social and economic setting  which  could  be\r\n\r\ncapitalised  on  in  the  recruitment  of  terrorists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For  example, we are aware  that  there  are\r\n\r\nMuslims  who  feel  that  they  are  being  discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  by  employers in the current economic situation.\r\n\r\nThere are some who feel that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  suppressed in the practice of their religion.   Some\r\n\r\nfeel they are marginalised in our society.  Whether these\r\n\r\nconcerns are perceived or real, we believe that this  can\r\n\r\nonly  be resolved through continuous dialogue within  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community across different ethnic  and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups and between the community and the Government.  The\r\n\r\ndialogue  should reach out to the wider community  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to forge consensus.  The Government has to be  open\r\n\r\nand  ensure  that  it  grasps the  real  feeling  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  Muslim  community  and  reflects   its\r\n\r\nsensitivity in the formulation of its policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore, being an open\r\n\r\neconomy,    is   facing   the   challenge   of   economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring  to  better  cope with  different  economic\r\n\r\nlandscape, characterised by intense competition and a new\r\n\r\neconomy.   Singaporeans,  being  subject  to  this   fast\r\n\r\nchanging, unpredictable and pressurising environment, are\r\n\r\nincreasingly   looking  to  religion  as  their   anchor.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a multi-racial society and open global city.\r\n\r\nThe   communities  here  are  easily  subject  to  events\r\n\r\nhappening  in the region and the world.  This will  bring\r\n\r\nstrain  to our social and religious harmony from time  to\r\n\r\ntime.   This  is  the challenge faced by all  ethnic  and\r\n\r\nreligious  groups  in  Singapore, as  we  cannot  isolate\r\n\r\nourselves  from  the outside world.   We  have  no  other\r\n\r\nalternative  but  to  take these  challenges  positively,\r\n\r\nbearing  in mind our common destiny as Singaporeans.   We\r\n\r\nshould engage in continuous dialogue and deliberation  to\r\n\r\nsort  out our differences and reach consensus.  We should\r\n\r\nemerge  from  such threats and potential conflicts  as  a\r\n\r\nstronger nation.  And all communities can then enjoy  the\r\n\r\nfruits of our development and social harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank  you for the opportunity to share my views on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 38 years ago, to be precise on 10th March 1965,\r\n\r\na  bomb  went  off  in MacDonald House  in  Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nkilling  three persons and injuring 37 others.  This  was\r\n\r\nduring the height of the Indonesian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConfrontation.  It was the work of infiltrators  sent  by\r\n\r\nthe  Sukarno regime, and it was the first time an act  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  of such a scale took place in Singapore.   The\r\n\r\ntwo  Indonesian marines who masterminded the bombing were\r\n\r\ncaught, convicted and hanged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time, I was a young boy, but that\r\n\r\nincident  and  two  racial riots  the  year  before  left\r\n\r\nlasting impressions in my mind.  And my memory was jolted\r\n\r\nagain  when news first broke out that the Government  had\r\n\r\narrested 15 persons in December 2001 for planning attacks\r\n\r\non  several  targets in Singapore.  If these attacks  had\r\n\r\nbeen  pulled  off,  the  damage  to  innocent  lives  and\r\n\r\nproperty  would  have been of far greater magnitude  than\r\n\r\nthat  one single act that took place 38 years ago, as  we\r\n\r\nhave found out from the many revelations that came in the\r\n\r\nensuing months as well as from the White Paper.   But  of\r\n\r\neven greater consequence to us would have been the damage\r\n\r\nto  ethnic  relations in multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because  those who  were  thwarted  in  their\r\n\r\nmission were Muslims, connected directly to Al Qaeda, and\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to carry out their mindless  acts  in  the\r\n\r\nname   of  Islam.   The  Jemaah  Islamiyah,  if  it   had\r\n\r\nsucceeded, would have placed Muslim Singaporeans under  a\r\n\r\nglaring but uncomfortable and unenviable spotlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the first arrests were made,\r\n\r\nthe Government made it clear that this was not a focus on\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim community but on the JI, that it  was  not  a\r\n\r\ncommunal  threat  but  one concerning  national  security\r\n\r\naffecting  all Singaporeans, underscores the  point  that\r\n\r\nthe  fabric of racial and religious harmony that we enjoy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  can  be  easily torn  apart  if  unfounded\r\n\r\nsuspicions  are  allowed to affect  the  way  non-Muslims\r\n\r\nbehave  towards  Muslims in Singapore.  For  decades,  we\r\n\r\nhave had the foresight to build a multi-racial and multi-religious society while giving recognition to the  unique\r\n\r\nflavour  of each ethnic group and the values and heritage\r\n\r\nof  each religious belief.  It would be benign of  me  to\r\n\r\nsimply put it that 37 years of nation building would have\r\n\r\nbeen in vain if we have not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfortified our resolve to live as one nation, one  people,\r\n\r\nregardless of race, language and religion, come what may.\r\n\r\nBut  the  reality  is that the harmony we  now  enjoy  is\r\n\r\nfragile  enough to be unzipped right down the middle,  if\r\n\r\nignited  by  an  event such as the one  that  might  have\r\n\r\nhappened if the JI had its way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the White Paper serves as a wake-up call.\r\n\r\nIts recommendations require us to be on the defensive  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  to be proactive in the fight against terrorism.\r\n\r\nWe  have enhanced our intelligence and tightened security\r\n\r\nmeasures.   We have passed laws to criminalise  terrorist\r\n\r\nfunding,  and  we have joined the global  effort  through\r\n\r\nsteps,   such   as  the  signing  of  the   International\r\n\r\nConvention  for  the  Suppression  of  the  Financing  of\r\n\r\nTerrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what is equally important is the proactive\r\n\r\nrole  of  each citizen to strengthen social cohesion  and\r\n\r\nracial  harmony.  Such a clarion call to  rally  everyone\r\n\r\nis,  of  course,  easy to make, and I have  found  myself\r\n\r\ngrappling  with  the thought that if we  do  encounter  a\r\n\r\nsituation where a dastardly attack takes place,  will  we\r\n\r\nfind ourselves asking: have we done enough - and have  we\r\n\r\ndone  it fast enough - to maintain the integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nrelations between our various peoples?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the reality of the present, we know\r\n\r\nwe  have time, hopefully, to scrutinise what we must  do.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the  IRCCs,  and we are  shaping  the  Code  on\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony, and I think these  are  all  positive\r\n\r\nmoves.   But  we  must ask ourselves, in  all  frankness,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  enough just to make symbolic  visits  to\r\n\r\ntemples and mosques.  While we take heart that good sense\r\n\r\ndoes  prevail  at  leadership levels, I find  myself,  at\r\n\r\ntimes,  fearful  that if a group of  evil  and  desperate\r\n\r\npersons  succeed  just  once  in  breaking  through   our\r\n\r\nmeticulous security cordon and explode their devices  and\r\n\r\ncause  untold damage, what would be the reaction  of  our\r\n\r\nown  heartlanders?   What would  be  the  effect  on  the\r\n\r\nmoderation and peace that we now enjoy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rightfully ask that there be more common space\r\n\r\nfor  the different races and that the social space  where\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans  can interact be expanded.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself has pointed out that  the  downside  to\r\n\r\nMuslims  feeling more at ease with social  activities  at\r\n\r\nmosques than anywhere else is that Muslims will feel less\r\n\r\nand less of a need to mingle with other races.  This is a\r\n\r\npoignant truth that the Muslim community has to ponder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we ask our Muslim friends to move closer\r\n\r\nto mainstream Singapore, at the same time, we who are the\r\n\r\nmajority, must not, unwittingly or otherwise, become more\r\n\r\nvigilant towards them because of the militant ideology of\r\n\r\nthe  few  in their midst.  In as much as we want to  know\r\n\r\nhow the Muslim community reacts and we have asked them to\r\n\r\nspeak out against terrorism, the rest of us must also not\r\n\r\noverreact,  because at the end of the day, if the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  feels  alienated, the JI would  have  won  the\r\n\r\npsychological battle.  I am therefore heartened  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government recognises that, in its efforts  to\r\n\r\nidentify and neutralise radical Islamic religious leaders\r\n\r\nand foreign terrorist operatives, it must not disrupt the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  and peaceful activities of the  local  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a fight over whose political\r\n\r\nideology  is  superior.   This is  about  a  war  against\r\n\r\nfanaticism,  against those who want their militant  brand\r\n\r\nof a religion to prevail.  How else can you make of their\r\n\r\ndeclared position that those who defect from their cause,\r\n\r\nor  who  do  not support their violent ways are  labelled\r\n\r\ninfidels?  What else can you make of an organisation that\r\n\r\nthinks  nothing of killing thousands, including those  of\r\n\r\ntheir own faith?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it therefore not significant to us that the plan\r\n\r\nto  bomb Yishun MRT Station was foiled because of a  call\r\n\r\nmade by a Muslim Singaporean to the ISD?  Whoever it  was\r\n\r\nmust have been aware that what is at stake is not a fight\r\n\r\nbetween Muslims and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims, but one of a cult-like organisation bent  on\r\n\r\ninflicting  senseless  attrition  versus  the   rest   of\r\n\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper has sent the message that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  no  pushover in this fight.  We will muster  all  our\r\n\r\nresources and work closely with every peace loving nation\r\n\r\nin the world.  Encountering the terrorist threat needs  a\r\n\r\nglobal  effort  and it cannot be done spasmodically.   If\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia  is the next battleground  in  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  terrorism,  then  regional  cooperation  becomes\r\n\r\nvital in our efforts to take on an organisation that  has\r\n\r\ncast  its tentacles across national boundaries.  It  took\r\n\r\nthe  bombings  in Bali for the Indonesian  government  to\r\n\r\nmove  from self-denial to the fact that they already have\r\n\r\nthe  enemy  within.   The rest of the world  watches  us.\r\n\r\nInvestors  will  not  make that fine distinction  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  other Southeast Asian  countries,  if  an\r\n\r\nattack  takes  place anywhere in the  region.   When  the\r\n\r\nbombs  in  Bali  went off, some countries  issued  travel\r\n\r\nadvisories   on   several  Southeast   Asian   countries,\r\n\r\nSingapore included.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, when our neighbours up north,\r\n\r\nin  their own wisdom, utter the \"W\" word in their dispute\r\n\r\nwith  us  over water and Pedra Branca, and in the process\r\n\r\nsend their own people into a frenzy, I think it is timely\r\n\r\nfor us also to remind them that what we have at hand is a\r\n\r\nreal war against an enemy, playing a game far more deadly\r\n\r\nthan  the  hysteria  we  have  to  bear  with  from  them\r\n\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to join in the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nmotion which I rise in support of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed the battle against terrorism and JI in\r\n\r\nparticular,  is not one that many, including  our  Muslim\r\n\r\ncompatriots  here  and  in the region,  will  deny.   The\r\n\r\nrecurring   bombings,  calculated  by   these   extremist\r\n\r\nelements to bring fear and terror to our civilised world,\r\n\r\nhave once again brought\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  region  into  a state of war; albeit  a  war  of  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  sort.  We are, today, faced with  one  of  the\r\n\r\ntoughest  challenges yet since the days when  we  had  to\r\n\r\nfight against the Communist insurgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the fight against the Communists, the war on\r\n\r\nterror  cannot  be fought against known  elements  alone.\r\n\r\nFor  every  Hambali or Bashir that we  put  into  prison,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  other\r\n\r\nsimilarly minded extremists who will be willing  to  rise\r\n\r\nin  their place.  Let us not under-estimate the extremity\r\n\r\nof  hatred  or feelings that these radicals have  against\r\n\r\nothers  and  its effect on their actions.  What  we  have\r\n\r\nhere  is  a  very potent mix of religious  and  political\r\n\r\nconvictions that so fill these terrorists that death, the\r\n\r\nvery  ultimate sacrifice of all, no longer  serves  as  a\r\n\r\nsobering influence on conduct.  In fact, for them, it  is\r\n\r\na  glory to die.  And, obviously, neither will it make  a\r\n\r\ndifference  that innocent civilians, and we  are  talking\r\n\r\nhere  of children, and of loving fathers and mothers  who\r\n\r\nfeed  these  children,  suffer  from  their  harmful  and\r\n\r\ndespicable actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the challenge we are faced with now is\r\n\r\neven  greater  than  the  challenge  we  faced  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist terrorists.  Communism is a political ideology.\r\n\r\nWe  could deal with it in surgical fashion.  We could ban\r\n\r\nCommunism.   We  could  isolate  Communist  guerillas  by\r\n\r\nconfining people in new villages.  And we taught a  whole\r\n\r\ngeneration  of Singaporeans to believe that Communism  is\r\n\r\nbad  and  is  the very antithesis of freedom and  wealth.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  Communism has proven to be a bankrupt  ideology.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the current fight against terrorism,  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with a very different enemy - people who  practise\r\n\r\nterrorism  in the name of religion.  Sir, they  are  like\r\n\r\ncancers in our body that cannot be gotten rid of.  We can\r\n\r\nonly treat it.  It may go into remission and one day,  it\r\n\r\nmay just rear its ugly head again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem here is the political and religious mix\r\n\r\nof Islam.  Radical Islam has its roots in the Middle East\r\n\r\nconflict.   The  creation of the state of Israel  in  the\r\n\r\npost-war period, and the subsequent flood\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  predominantly Muslim Palestinian refugees into Jordan\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere has been an underlying source of  conflict\r\n\r\nand  tension  in  the  Middle East.  That  the  Americans\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen to cast their lot with the  Israelis  in\r\n\r\nthis   conflict  throughout  does  not  help   with   the\r\n\r\nperception  that  the Palestinians  have  been  given  an\r\n\r\nunfair  deck  of  cards.   Throughout  this  period,  the\r\n\r\nIslamic  revolution in Iran, together with the successful\r\n\r\noverthrow  of the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan  by\r\n\r\nthe  Talebans, served to provide new inspiration for  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of fundamentalism in Islam.  This was, in no small\r\n\r\npart,  helped by the growing influence of Wahabism, which\r\n\r\nis another form of fundamentalist Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-arching reach of fundamentalist Islam worldwide cannot be ignored. In Southeast Asia, the force of\r\n\r\nIslam in the political realm cannot be ignored.  For many\r\n\r\nstates,  particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, no  serious\r\n\r\npolitical  contender can hope to gain national prominence\r\n\r\nwithout paying close attention to the Muslim ground.   In\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  PAS, as an Islamic-based political party,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  gaining much political grounds in recent elections;\r\n\r\nand  this  despite  their  open  espousal  of  eventually\r\n\r\ntransforming Malaysia into an Islamic state based on  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  laws.   Similarly,  in Indonesia,  Islamic-based\r\n\r\npolitical  organisations, such as the NU, can often  turn\r\n\r\nthe   political  tide  in  an  electoral  contest.    The\r\n\r\ninfluence  of these organisations in Indonesia has  grown\r\n\r\nquite  dramatically in recent years and is a force to  be\r\n\r\nreckoned with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Singapore, the force of Islamic\r\n\r\nfundamentalism  has not avoided us.   That  we  see  some\r\n\r\nMuslims in Singapore pushing their bounds with the  State\r\n\r\non  their dress code in schools is but a variant  of  the\r\n\r\nmix  between  religion and politics.  It is  no  accident\r\n\r\nthat, in the last 20 years at least, we see more and more\r\n\r\nMuslims  becoming more conservative in the  doctrine  and\r\n\r\nthe  practice of their faith.  I know of many  colleagues\r\n\r\nin my office who, over the years, have insisted on taking\r\n\r\non  the  strict Islamic code of dressing.  We  also  note\r\n\r\nthat there is an increasing number of Muslim parents who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare choosing to send their children to the madrasahs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case I am misunderstood, I am not against\r\n\r\nany  form  of fundamentalism or conservatism in religious\r\n\r\npractice.   In fact, I support it as the purist  approach\r\n\r\nhelps  to  keep  a  perspective on the original  founding\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  the  faith.  What I  am  against  is  the\r\n\r\ninsistence  on  one's right to practise and  observe  his\r\n\r\nbeliefs  even if it means the others may feel that  their\r\n\r\npersonal  or  common public spaces may be  encroached  or\r\n\r\nimposed upon.  Additionally, I am against the practice of\r\n\r\na  faith  in a manner that passes judgment on all  others\r\n\r\nthat  they are infidels and are destined for the  eternal\r\n\r\nhell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason and for the sake of our social\r\n\r\ncohesion  that we issue a call to our Muslim  compatriots\r\n\r\nto  be moderate in their faith.  Sir, whilst nobody would\r\n\r\ndeny  the  unassailable logic of the need to be moderate,\r\n\r\nthere  are  several issues associated with the call  that\r\n\r\nshould perhaps be discussed further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the battle against terrorism is not confined\r\n\r\nsimply   to  just  arresting  a  few  key  suspects   and\r\n\r\ndismantling  the  JI network.  It goes beyond  that.   As\r\n\r\nwith our battle against Communism, it is really about the\r\n\r\nbattle for the hearts and minds of the people.  A fertile\r\n\r\nground  for  the spread of extremist ideas  would  always\r\n\r\nexist  where social conditions permit.  Communism thrives\r\n\r\nand  spreads  against a backdrop of abject poverty.   The\r\n\r\nneed  for moderation is a function of the extent to which\r\n\r\nthe  affected  social  class perceives  itself  as  being\r\n\r\nmarginalised  and  disadvantaged.  In  other  words,  the\r\n\r\ngreater  the  perception and reality that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries of any progress or trickle of  wealth  that\r\n\r\ncomes  through the system, the greater is the  likelihood\r\n\r\nof  those  affected,  rejecting  the  legitimacy  of  the\r\n\r\nestablished regime and its leadership, and the  need  for\r\n\r\nmoderation  in  their  conduct.   The  bombings  in   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Indonesia grew as much out of  conditions\r\n\r\nof   social  desperation  as  it  did  of  political  and\r\n\r\nreligious convictions.  Let me put it another\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway.   If the Philippines and Indonesia were in the  same\r\n\r\neconomic  league as Australia and Japan, would  the  same\r\n\r\nextent of bombing incidents have taken place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we cannot say that our Muslim\r\n\r\ncompatriots  are  a  deprived group.  However,  the  same\r\n\r\ncannot  be  said  at  the same time  that  there  are  no\r\n\r\ndisparities  in the socio-economic conditions  among  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Muslims  that  there is no reason  for  us  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Over the years, we recognise that the  social\r\n\r\nand  political stability in Singapore can only come about\r\n\r\nif  all ethnic groups moved together in reaping from  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  the progress in this country.  Indeed,  one\r\n\r\nunderlying  objective  for  establishing  Mendaki  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the Malay Muslims in Singapore are not  left\r\n\r\nbehind as the country prospers.  After more than 35 years\r\n\r\nof  independence, one can confidently say that  the  gaps\r\n\r\nbetween the Malay Muslims and the other ethnic groups are\r\n\r\nclosing.  However, more can be done.  There is still  the\r\n\r\nperception  that we are still some way off in all  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups being on par on the economic terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the disparity among the various\r\n\r\nethnic groups tends to sharpen in focus in times when the\r\n\r\neconomy  moves  into prolonged recession as  our  economy\r\n\r\nseems to be heading.  The next few years will prove to be\r\n\r\nequally  challenging as we struggle to recover  from  our\r\n\r\npresent  round  of sluggish economic performance.   Until\r\n\r\nthen,  there  will be many who will be unemployed.   Such\r\n\r\nconditions tend to reinforce the \"them and us\" mentality.\r\n\r\nIf we are not careful, this may serve to deepen the fault\r\n\r\nlines  in our society.  Certainly, it does not help  that\r\n\r\nsome  irresponsible parents could not have chosen a worse\r\n\r\ntime  to  bring up the tudung issue.  When  the  economic\r\n\r\ntide  is down, the jetsam and the flotsam suddenly become\r\n\r\nall  the  more  obvious for all to see.  Such  conditions\r\n\r\nprovide  the  fodder  with which  to  fuel  the  fire  of\r\n\r\nextremist exploitation.  If the people, by and large, are\r\n\r\nled  to  believe that their present plight is due not  so\r\n\r\nmuch to structural economic problems but to the result of\r\n\r\nunfair Government policy, we have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  on  hand that the arrest of a few  key  trouble-makers is not going to resolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point. When we speak of\r\n\r\nmoderate Islam, one question which arises is: who defines\r\n\r\nwhat  is  moderate Islam?  And will the people, on  whose\r\n\r\nshoulders  lie  the  responsibility of defining  moderate\r\n\r\nIslam,  enjoy  the  legitimacy of  authority  within  the\r\n\r\ntarget audience, or are they seen as just an extension of\r\n\r\nthe   regime  that  does  not  enjoy  their   trust   and\r\n\r\nconfidence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore, as indeed Muslims all over\r\n\r\nthe  world,  are  subject  to  competing  influences  and\r\n\r\ndoctrines.  Just the other day, we read in the papers  of\r\n\r\nhow  a fiery cleric was asked to leave London because  of\r\n\r\nthe  inflammatory  content of  his  sermon.   Charismatic\r\n\r\nclerics,  like  this one, can pose a  danger  to  society\r\n\r\nsimply from their ability to influence masses through the\r\n\r\npower of their oratorical skills.  If you have heard  one\r\n\r\nof  these fiery clerics preach, you would have known  how\r\n\r\npersuasive and influential these preachers can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in Singapore, MUIS is concerned about the\r\n\r\ntype  of  preachers who get invited to address the  local\r\n\r\ncongregation.   We,  too, recognise  how  much  damage  a\r\n\r\nradical  and  persuasive cleric  can  do  to  our  social\r\n\r\nfabric.   In  the Internet age, we live in  a  borderless\r\n\r\nworld.   No amount of restriction and restraint is  going\r\n\r\nto   prevent  radical  Islam  from  spreading  among  and\r\n\r\ninfluencing  the local people.  Ultimately,  whether  the\r\n\r\npeople who preach moderation will prevail will depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir  legitimacy  in the eyes of the faithful.   To  the\r\n\r\nextent  that these moderate leaders command the following\r\n\r\nand  respect  of  the Muslims, there should  not  be  any\r\n\r\nproblem  in  holding the radicals at bay.   However,  the\r\n\r\nability of the moderate leaders in a cosmopolitan society\r\n\r\nin   holding   the  Muslims  together  will  come   under\r\n\r\nincreasing   pressure  as  the  wave  of   fundamentalism\r\n\r\ncontinues to sweep across the Southeast Asian region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim leaders in Singapore, whether they are\r\n\r\npoliticians or religious leaders,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperate within the constraints of a multi-racial society.\r\n\r\nIt may not be possible for them at all times to impose on\r\n\r\nthe  larger society the specific demands of their  faith.\r\n\r\nThe  issues  of  wearing the tudung in  schools  and  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  sale of alcohol are but  some  examples.\r\n\r\nThe perceived inability to advance their specific demands\r\n\r\narguably   may  compromise  their  moral  authority   and\r\n\r\nlegitimate  standing, in the eyes of  the  followers,  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  matters of the faith.  If this happens,  the\r\n\r\nmessage  from the moderate leaders to the Muslims  to  be\r\n\r\nmoderate  may not enjoy the same support and standing  as\r\n\r\none  would  have hoped for.  The feared outcome  is  that\r\n\r\ndespite  the  message for moderation, there may  well  be\r\n\r\nMuslims  who will continue to nurse a silent respect  for\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim terrorists who are prepared to die for  their\r\n\r\ncause,  thus  lending a fertile ground for  other  Muslim\r\n\r\nteachers to teach otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, in this battle, the State cannot be seen\r\n\r\nto have an active part in defining what moderate Islam is\r\n\r\nor  should be, and neither the religious teachers who are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  lead the way be seen to be  agents  of  the\r\n\r\nState.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, social cohesion, even in the context of\r\n\r\nmoderate  Islam, cannot be strengthened if,  as  we  have\r\n\r\nseen   in   recent   years,  the  mosques   continue   to\r\n\r\nincreasingly  serve as a focal point for the  Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  an MP on the ground, I cannot  help  but\r\n\r\nnotice that many Muslims are increasingly retreating into\r\n\r\nthe  comfort zones of the mosques for their religious and\r\n\r\nother  needs as well.  I can only attribute this  to  the\r\n\r\nrecent  resurgence in Islam in Singapore,  and  this  has\r\n\r\ninspired  many to turn to the mosques.  This has resulted\r\n\r\nin  low  participation  rate  for  the  secular  communal\r\n\r\nactivities   among   the  Muslims   at   our   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.  Just look at the participation rate among\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims  on  the activities organised  by  community\r\n\r\ncentres in Singapore today.  I dare say that, without the\r\n\r\nbenefit   of  a  proper  study,  the  number  of  Muslims\r\n\r\nparticipating  in these activities can be  improved,  and\r\n\r\nthe low number certainly is not welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This withdrawal, coupled with the recent events,\r\n\r\ncertainly provide much room for unhealthy prejudices  and\r\n\r\nmisgivings  among Singaporeans.  For social  cohesion  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen, Muslims in Singapore should not be seen to be\r\n\r\nsetting  themselves  apart  from  the  rest  of  society.\r\n\r\nInstead, they should be seen to be actively engaging  the\r\n\r\nwider  society  in various activities in order  to  build\r\n\r\nmore  bridges so that whatever prejudices the others  may\r\n\r\nhave will disappear.  Firm friendships and bonds must  be\r\n\r\nengendered  that  go  beyond the  market  and  workplace.\r\n\r\nToken  visits  to each other's places of  worship  as  an\r\n\r\nouter sign of promoting racial harmony should be expanded\r\n\r\nto  include active interaction and exchanges.   As  loyal\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, we should make it a point to develop  long-lasting and deep friendships with people who are  not  of\r\n\r\nthe  same colour of skin or of the same creed.  Only then\r\n\r\nwill  we be able to disabuse ourselves and perhaps others\r\n\r\nof  whatever prejudices that may have previously festered\r\n\r\nin our minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this debate is not only about combating\r\n\r\nterrorism and the Jemaah Islamiyah in particular.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot deny that these issues are important.  This debate is\r\n\r\nalso  about  the larger context within which  the  battle\r\n\r\nagainst terrorism is fought.  This battle goes beyond the\r\n\r\nhunt  for  and  the  arrest of key JI  or  even  Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\nsuspects.  To succeed, we must be mindful that, as in our\r\n\r\nfight  against the Communists, we have to win the  hearts\r\n\r\nand minds of those involved.  For our Muslim compatriots,\r\n\r\nmoderation  in the practice of their faith must  continue\r\n\r\nto  remain the cornerstone of their belief, if we want to\r\n\r\nmaintain racial and religious harmony in Singapore.   For\r\n\r\nthe   non-Muslims,  nursing  unfounded   prejudices   and\r\n\r\nengaging  in  discriminatory practices is  a  recipe  for\r\n\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that the flag which represents\r\n\r\nthis country uses the red colour to signify the universal\r\n\r\nbrotherhood  of man.  It should not matter  that  we  are\r\n\r\nMuslims,  Christians,  Buddhists, Hindus  or  even  free-thinkers.  What matters most is that we are Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndedicated as a people towards building a country that  we\r\n\r\ncan  all  be proud of.  The day we forget this  principle\r\n\r\nwould  be  the day when we go down the slippery slope  of\r\n\r\nstrife  and  racial tension.  If that happens,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill just be another sad statistic of a dream shattered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost is high, if we do not succeed in this\r\n\r\nbattle.  We must therefore strengthen our resolve  to  do\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  takes,  and  to take  whatever  to  do,  to\r\n\r\nvanquish terrorism and all its attendant evil.   We  have\r\n\r\nno choice on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name\r\n\r\nof the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I empathise with those who wish that the debate\r\n\r\non  this issue should not be prolonged, especially so for\r\n\r\none  who  is  the  13th speaker of the  day!   Enough  is\r\n\r\nenough,  some might say, both by Muslims and  non-Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Perhaps, a sentiment felt  more  by  the\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those who believe so, Mr Wong's remarks\r\n\r\nearlier, I trust, would explain why this White Paper  had\r\n\r\nto  be  presented  to  Parliament.   Muslim  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  rest assured that this Paper is not about finding\r\n\r\nfault  with the overwhelming majority of Muslims who  are\r\n\r\nmoderate and tolerant.  Indeed, these Muslim Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthemselves  feel that they are the victims of this  small\r\n\r\ngroup of misled Singaporeans who tried to hijack Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bears reiterating that the majority of Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  believe in living peacefully  with  others,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  this  plural,  multi-racial  and   multi-religious  Singapore.  It will reassure the Muslims  that\r\n\r\nthis  debate  is not about finger-pointing Islam  as  the\r\n\r\ncause  for  all  the ills brought about by  the  face  of\r\n\r\nterror  today.  Yes, Muslims will be quick to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  there is only one Islam, but they cannot deny  that\r\n\r\nthere are many faces of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslims and many ways how Islam is interpreted or, worse,\r\n\r\nabused.    Even   here,   there  is   room   for   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding among Muslims themselves, and also  by  the\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims.  There are many grey areas here, where black-and-white  pronouncements might not be the quick  answers\r\n\r\ntowards better understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long haul, and requires patience,\r\n\r\nperseverance  and wisdom in handling it.   It  calls  for\r\n\r\ncontinued  confidence-building.  It is not the form  that\r\n\r\nmatters.   Yes, visits to mosques, temples, churches  and\r\n\r\nclan  associations  must continue, dialogues  on  how  to\r\n\r\nhandle differences made a staple programme for grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  but the underlying foundation  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding should be greater tolerance and  acceptance\r\n\r\nin  diversity.   Race and religious relations  should  be\r\n\r\ninclusive  rather  than exclusive.  Most  importantly,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  rejection  of  terrorism,  no  matter  what  their\r\n\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper in front of us for debate has called\r\n\r\nthis  threat of JI-types and of terrorism as  a  national\r\n\r\none.   Do  enough Singaporeans know what that means?   Do\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  really  know how  serious  the  threat  is?\r\n\r\nJudging from the reaction of some of whom I have  met,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure  they do.  For sure, not many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave read the White Paper.  We hope many more will follow\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary debate on the White Paper,  as  it  is\r\n\r\ncritical that as many Singaporeans as possible understand\r\n\r\nwhat holds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans better believe that this threat is\r\n\r\nreal.   JI is real, and the threat of terrorism, whatever\r\n\r\nthe  cause, is real.  Any sense of denial, as still  held\r\n\r\nby  some,  will  not help.  However,  this  needs  to  be\r\n\r\naddressed,  perhaps  through  more  dialogues,  even   at\r\n\r\ngrassroots   level,   as   some   generally   responsible\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders do seem to still harbour such feelings\r\n\r\nof scepticism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent Feedback Unit dialogue which I chaired,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  there are still those  who  are  sceptical\r\n\r\nabout  the  findings, even to the point of  doubting  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the ISD.  \"Was force used?\",\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey asked.  \"Why not charge them in open court, if there\r\n\r\nare  already enough evidence?\", they asked.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nbooklet \"Why the ISA\", recently issued by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs, will help to explain and convince more  why\r\n\r\nSingapore has to tackle the issue this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those not convinced, even the question of why no\r\n\r\npublic confession was yet raised, despite the explanation\r\n\r\ngiven  why  such  an approach was stopped  following  the\r\n\r\nexperience of earlier ISA arrests.  All these add to  the\r\n\r\nnotion  how  complex  the issue is and  why  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to educate and reach out to more Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nmake  them understand how national this issue is and  why\r\n\r\nit needs more careful handling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans who still feel uneasy about them\r\n\r\nand  their  religion  Islam being in  the  spotlight  yet\r\n\r\nagain, rest assured that it is more of the effort on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Government to throw more light  on  the  JI\r\n\r\narrests, the JI members' operations, their psyche,  their\r\n\r\nregional   and   global  connections  and  their   deadly\r\n\r\ndastardly  schemes.   For those who  openly  or  secretly\r\n\r\nempathise  with  such  suicidal  terroristic  methods  of\r\n\r\nfurthering the JI cause, think how you would feel if your\r\n\r\nown innocent flesh and blood fell victim to such bombings\r\n\r\nor  attacks.  If you say it is still all right, then  the\r\n\r\nproblem is even more serious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some, although having accepted the threat of JI and\r\n\r\nterrorism,  wondered  why  the Government  prolonged  the\r\n\r\ndebate.   \"The  sooner we close the matter, the  better\",\r\n\r\nfearing  that the image of Muslim Singaporeans  would  be\r\n\r\naffected, not only locally but all over the world.   They\r\n\r\nquestion  the need to place the White Paper on  sale  and\r\n\r\nmade available freely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel otherwise, as I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  need  for the White Paper  to  be  issued  and\r\n\r\ndebated.  However, I trust the Minister will explain  why\r\n\r\nthe  price was pegged at a high of $22 each when we would\r\n\r\nlike it to reach more citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are many Singaporeans who feel, \"Oh,\r\n\r\nno,  not  another JI report!\", or \"Why place the  Muslims\r\n\r\nunder  the spotlight again?\"  But I feel this White Paper\r\n\r\nshould be made essential reading for as many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nas  possible, if we want to ensure that the challenge  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  we face is understood as national.   Teachers,\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders, including religious leaders,  need  a\r\n\r\ngood  understanding of the issue and the  role  they  can\r\n\r\nplay to bring about better social cohesion.  However, the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper needs to be reduced to simpler language  and\r\n\r\ncreative  graphic  representations  to  reach   as   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans should feel reassured that the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  made  it clear that the large  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Muslims and Islam were not at  fault.   It  is\r\n\r\nthis  small  group  of  misguided JI-type  Muslims  which\r\n\r\nMuslim Singaporeans and non-Muslim Singaporeans alike are\r\n\r\nconcerned about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth reiterating that this is not a question\r\n\r\nof  Muslims  and  Islam  yet again under  the  spotlight.\r\n\r\nThanks  to  ISD,  also the regional security  cooperation\r\n\r\nwith the relevant authorities in Malaysia, Indonesia, the\r\n\r\nPhilippines   and   many  other  international   players,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was able to nip the problem in the  bud.   The\r\n\r\nefficacy  and  good intentions of the  ISD  need  not  be\r\n\r\ndoubted.   Networks  of  terrorist  destruction  work  in\r\n\r\nstrange and most irresponsible ways.  They care not lives\r\n\r\nof  innocents, and rationalise such dastardly  acts  even\r\n\r\nwith religious conveniences and mis-justifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noteworthy that the original tip-off that\r\n\r\nled  to  the  JI arrests came from a Muslim  Singaporean,\r\n\r\njust to emphasise that Muslims and non-Muslims alike will\r\n\r\nhave to fight this battle together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the JI is Muslim-connected, so is the Al-Qaeda,\r\n\r\nbut  Muslim  Singaporeans must be bold enough  to  reject\r\n\r\nthem  as their methods bring terror, not solution to  the\r\n\r\nproblems faced.  The collective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrejection  of the JI and acts of terrorism  by  the  more\r\n\r\nthan  120  Muslim  groups  in Singapore  bodes  well  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and our fight against extremism and terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Muslim Singaporeans, on their part, should\r\n\r\nremove  any  fear  of  Muslims or Islam  in  general  and\r\n\r\ninstead  work  hand-in-hand with the Muslim community  to\r\n\r\nrid of this menace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about ISD, Sir, I remember their\r\n\r\nprofessional work standards which Singapore can be  proud\r\n\r\nof.   Back  in  1973,  when the University  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nMuslim  Society was invited by President Moammar Ghaddafi\r\n\r\nto  attend the International Youth Conference, they  knew\r\n\r\nabout  it.  I had to convince the ISD officers  that  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore Muslim Society representatives,\r\n\r\nincluding  myself, were moderate Muslims, even though  we\r\n\r\nwere  going to Libya, and that they have nothing to worry\r\n\r\nabout.   We  were open and transparent about  the  matter\r\n\r\nbut,  despite  that,  both the USMS representatives  were\r\n\r\nstopped  at  the  airport on their  return  and  all  the\r\n\r\npublications were confiscated for checking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was furious as they had doubted me and my loyalty,\r\n\r\nI  thought,  but on hindsight, was happy that  they  were\r\n\r\nthorough  and  professional in their  conduct  and  work.\r\n\r\nDuring that two-week stay in Libya, many things happened.\r\n\r\nYes,  most of those who attended the conference  were  in\r\n\r\nsearch of answers for their troubled situations back home\r\n\r\nand  in  the Muslim world.  Where was the answer promised\r\n\r\nby  Islam?   There  were  so many  double  standards  and\r\n\r\nhypocracies felt in international relations.  It was true\r\n\r\nthen,  and  I  am  sure you will say the  same  for  now.\r\n\r\nGhaddafi  had  proposed Islam as the Third  International\r\n\r\nTheory,  where he said that capitalism and Communism  had\r\n\r\nfailed,  and brought about the Green Book, as his  answer\r\n\r\nto  the  world's  predicaments.  Most  of  the  delegates\r\n\r\nrejected  the theory and the conference ended in failure,\r\n\r\nmuch to the chagrin of the host.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delegates then participated in demonstrations,\r\n\r\npeaceful though, on the streets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Tripoli for the Palestinian cause and some were  even\r\n\r\napproached  to  serve in the shadow cabinet-in-exile  for\r\n\r\nthe  Moros  of  the  Philippines.   There  were  lots  of\r\n\r\nsympathies for many causes of the Muslim then world-wide,\r\n\r\nbut  that  did not make us, in fact, most delegates,  see\r\n\r\nthe need to go the JI way or to resort to terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious threat of misconceived \"Jihad\" or \"Holy\r\n\r\nWar\", is real, even till today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr M J Akbar, writing in his book, The Shade of\r\n\r\nSwords,   Jihad  and  the  Conflict  between  Islam   and\r\n\r\nChristianity,  concludes that \"Defeat (of  Osama  and  Al\r\n\r\nQaeda  and  the Talebans) is only a setback in  the  holy\r\n\r\nwar.  The Jihad goes on\".  However, that should not alarm\r\n\r\nus,  as  it  is not new.  The power of jihad,  for  some,\r\n\r\npervades  the mind and soul of Islam.  The mind is  where\r\n\r\nthe  current battle will be fought, and this  is  why  it\r\n\r\nwill be a very long war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans should realise that they should\r\n\r\nnot  be  pawns, nor proxy, to such battles.   The  lesson\r\n\r\nfrom Pakistan is clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bloodbath separation from India to form its\r\n\r\nown  country  of majority Muslims, it is now  seen  as  a\r\n\r\nhotbed of this battle of the mind.  M J Akbar wrote  that\r\n\r\nPakistan  has  become  a  haven of  terrorists  who  have\r\n\r\ncreated  \"a state within a state\".  He said that  no  one\r\n\r\nsaid  this  more clearly than President Pervez Musharraf,\r\n\r\nwhen in an address to the nation a year ago, asked for an\r\n\r\nend  to  the  culture  of jihad.  He told  the  extremist\r\n\r\nclergy that they must stop encouraging gullible young men\r\n\r\ninto martyrdom, as he would not want Pakistan to take the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for jihad across the world.  He would  not\r\n\r\nallow  mosques  to  be misused and seminaries  to  become\r\n\r\nschools for hatred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia too, the ruling government has begun its\r\n\r\ncrackdown  on  rural religious schools  (SARs)  that  sow\r\n\r\nhatred against the government by withdrawing funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, for Singapore, the bad influence was\r\n\r\nmarginal and had been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnipped  in  the bud.  Nevertheless, it happened  and  can\r\n\r\nhappen  again.  It is therefore the duty of all to ensure\r\n\r\nsuch tendencies do not repeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS and local Muslim groups and leaders have done\r\n\r\nwell  in responding to the call to reject extremist views\r\n\r\nand  acts  of  terrorism.   The  Malay  MPs  have  stated\r\n\r\nunequivocally  their position to reject the  JI  and  its\r\n\r\nextremist  agenda.   Together with the  Malay  community,\r\n\r\nthey   have  pledged  to  continue  to  work  with  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to bring about a more cohesive, multi-racial\r\n\r\nand  multi-religious society.  Realising that  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  terrorism  and extremism will  be  a  long-drawn\r\n\r\naffair,  the Malay MPs call on everyone, Malays and  non-Malays alike, to stand up and work together to strengthen\r\n\r\nmutual trust and confidence and move on as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Delhi in November, I learned that\r\n\r\nfurther   bloodshed   was   avoided   when   the   Muslim\r\n\r\norganisations  came out in force to condemn  the  violent\r\n\r\nand  terrorist attacks by extremist Muslim groups on  the\r\n\r\nHindu community in Gujerat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, following a denial mode in Indonesia from\r\n\r\nmost  Muslim  groups, the Bali bomb blast of  October  12\r\n\r\njolted  them  to work alongside the Government  to  fight\r\n\r\nterrorism.   This,  I was told, avoided  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nbacklash  between the majority Hindus  in  Bali  and  the\r\n\r\nminority Muslims on the island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have this unique\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  work together to remove  such  unhealthy\r\n\r\nradicalism among fringe Muslim groups.  This is a  battle\r\n\r\nwe  do not have to, and cannot fight alone.  I would like\r\n\r\nto urge the Government to enhance regional cooperation so\r\n\r\nas  to  ensure  that no one group can  abuse  the  common\r\n\r\nborders  for any terrorist attacks.  There are more  that\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  in terms of regional cooperation  in  this\r\n\r\nfight against terrorism, and we certainly look forward to\r\n\r\nour neighbours sharing this sense of urgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a final note, we must do all we can to find\r\n\r\nways  to make both our Muslim Singaporeans and non-Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be at ease with each other.   Yes,  there\r\n\r\nwill be a certain amount of awkwardness, as mentioned  by\r\n\r\nMr  Wong  just now, but let that be just a passing  wind.\r\n\r\nLet  us  look to the IRCC and Harmony Circles  to  bridge\r\n\r\nbetter  relations and understanding at the HDB heartland.\r\n\r\nMore  Malays/Muslims  should  use  this  opportunity   to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  level  of participation at  the  grassroots\r\n\r\nlevel.  There is now an unprecedented demand for a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding about the Malay-Muslim way of life and  the\r\n\r\nMalays/Muslims  should  not waste  this  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nbetter bridging and better understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lighter note, Sir, although it is quite late,\r\n\r\nit would not be long before Mr Rafi of Marine Parade will\r\n\r\nbe  comfortable again with his sarong, where and when  he\r\n\r\nchooses  to  wear, although I personally  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nsarong is best worn at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when I read the White Paper on the  Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah  Arrests  and The Threat of  Terrorism,  I  was\r\n\r\nsobered by the realisation that we are in for a long-term\r\n\r\nbattle with terrorism, and that it is a difficult battle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a difficult battle for at least two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst,  it  is tied up with the shadowy force of  radical\r\n\r\nand  militant Islam in the world and in the region.  And,\r\n\r\nsecond, the outcome of the battle is not totally  in  our\r\n\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI branch in Singapore is part of a larger JI\r\n\r\nnetwork with cells in the region, such as in Malaysia and\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   It  is  part of the same  network  that  has\r\n\r\ncarried  out dozens of other deadly bombings in Indonesia\r\n\r\nand the Philippines in the past few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a multi-national organisation, operating\r\n\r\nacross  borders.  This means that the problems cannot  be\r\n\r\nwiped out, no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter   how  effective  our  security  and  intelligence\r\n\r\nagencies are, because the key operatives are outside  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  beyond our control.  It is  instructive  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  Singapore  JI  branch  reported  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian JI leadership.  This means that Singapore  will\r\n\r\nalways have to be on guard against its citizens not being\r\n\r\nrecruited  by  foreign radical Muslim  leaders  or  their\r\n\r\nextreme  interpretations of the faith, and that they  are\r\n\r\nnot swayed by their militant causes and visions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the White Paper, one can glean that the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans arrested for their JI activities  harbour  a\r\n\r\nstrong anti-US sentiment, coupled with a belief that they\r\n\r\nshould  wage  militant jihad against  the  oppressors  of\r\n\r\nMuslims in the world, such as against Christians  in  the\r\n\r\nMalukus  in  Indonesia.   Indeed,  while  some   of   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  arrested  have  had  combat  experience  in\r\n\r\nAfghanistan,  many  have  had  training  nearby,  in  the\r\n\r\nMalukus  and  Batam  in Indonesia,  as  well  as  in  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conflicts in the region not only served to\r\n\r\ngive concrete meaning to the concept of militant jihad, a\r\n\r\nkey  element  of JI's ideology, but also provided  easily\r\n\r\naccessible  places  where recruits from  Singapore  could\r\n\r\ngain practical combat experience.  While the Singaporeans\r\n\r\njoined in the fight in what may seem to be local disputes\r\n\r\nin  the region, they also believed in the ultimate aim of\r\n\r\ntheir  struggle  -  for an Islamic state  empire  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several were even willing to be suicide bombers, if\r\n\r\nthey  were  instructed to do so by the JI leaders  -  the\r\n\r\nultimate sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this backdrop, I would like to\r\n\r\nhighlight three points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this is a regional problem which requires\r\n\r\nregional cooperation and regional political will.  And at\r\n\r\nall  levels,  not  just at the level of intelligence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  agencies,  and not just exchanging  information\r\n\r\nand acting on them.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take one of the plans by Hambali, the JI point-main\r\n\r\nwith   Al-Qaeda,  who  wanted  to  attack  key  Singapore\r\n\r\ninstallations,  and  to  represent  them   as   acts   of\r\n\r\naggression by the Malaysian government.  According to the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper, Hambali's aim was to create a situation  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Singapore, which  would  be  conducive  to\r\n\r\noverthrowing  the Malaysian government  and  provoking  a\r\n\r\nrevolution  that  would  turn Malaysia  into  an  Islamic\r\n\r\nstate.   Hambali wanted to provoke distrust and animosity\r\n\r\nbetween a \"Muslim\" Malaysia and a \"Chinese Singapore\" and\r\n\r\ncause  ethnic strife in both countries.  Hambali's  hope,\r\n\r\nthe White Paper added, was that Muslims in both countries\r\n\r\nwould  then respond to calls for jihad and turn  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Singapore into another Ambon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, just reading the newspapers, especially the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  ones, over the last few months  or  so,  would\r\n\r\ngive  one the impression that it does not need a  Hambali\r\n\r\nto   provoke  distrust  and  animosity  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.   It  would  seem that  some  politicians  and\r\n\r\ncommentators  are quite capable of doing that  already  -\r\n\r\nwhipping  up anti-Singapore sentiments over any  possible\r\n\r\nissue,  from  the  ownership of  Pedra  Branca,  to  land\r\n\r\nreclamation and the supply of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is particularly disturbing is that the\r\n\r\ndiscourse  in  Malaysia is not above evoking  anti-Muslim\r\n\r\nimages.   For  instance,  the  Malaysian  Berita   Harian\r\n\r\npublished  an  editorial  in December  titled  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nBehaving  Like  The Jews In Claiming Batu Putih  Island\".\r\n\r\nThe Malay-language daily said that Singapore was behaving\r\n\r\nlike   the   Jews  who  stole  land  belonging   to   the\r\n\r\nPalestinians.   I  quote, \"So just like  Israel  that  is\r\n\r\nsurrounded by Arab countries, Singapore is like a  Jewish\r\n\r\nstate surrounded by Malay states.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now, we know that Israel and\r\n\r\nthe  Palestine issues are explosive issues which  provoke\r\n\r\ndeep  resentment in most parts of the Muslim world.  Such\r\n\r\nrhetoric  to  cast Singapore in such light is  dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous not only because it may give radical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslims  around  the  world another  reason  to  look  at\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  target  for  militant  jihad.   It   is\r\n\r\ndangerous   also  because  it  can  create  a   tinderbox\r\n\r\natmosphere  in  which the racial and religious  cleavages\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two  countries can be easily  exploited  by\r\n\r\nmilitant Muslims with just a strike of the match, at  the\r\n\r\nright, or rather, the wrong time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such rhetoric is also grossly irresponsible.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a multi-racial state, with  a  significant\r\n\r\nMuslim minority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not oblivious to the vagaries of the\r\n\r\nelection  season in neighbouring countries, but  I  would\r\n\r\nurge the politicians from across the Causeway to bear  in\r\n\r\nmind the major challenge facing us together, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe threat of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may seem easy and almost cost-free to score\r\n\r\npolitical  points  at home by whipping up  anti-Singapore\r\n\r\nsentiments,  it  is  a high-risk game,  especially  given\r\n\r\nthese volatile times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like two next-door neighbours quarrelling\r\n\r\nabout  who owns the spot outside the doorway, when  there\r\n\r\nare  ruthless murderers lurking along the corridors  with\r\n\r\nbombs  that  will  not only blow up  the  contested  spot\r\n\r\noutside  the  door  but all that they have  built  within\r\n\r\ntheir homes as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that our fates are intertwined. It\r\n\r\nis  important  that  the countries in  this  region  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  present  a  united  front  in  curbing  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of extremist groups in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this effort, people-to-people relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two  countries should be  strengthened  and\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding fostered.  Such  a  civil  society\r\n\r\nproject   cannot  move  forward  if  the  poisonous   and\r\n\r\nfractious atmosphere between the two countries remain and\r\n\r\nis allowed to escalate, stoked by one-sided media reports\r\n\r\nwhich  demonise Singapore.  Once hatred is sowed  in  the\r\n\r\nheart of the peoples, it can take on a dynamic of its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nown   and  be  beyond  the  control  of  their  political\r\n\r\nmasterminds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilateral disputes, however vexing, should be seen\r\n\r\nagainst  the bigger strategic picture.  We face a  common\r\n\r\nchallenge.  We share a common destiny, whether we like it\r\n\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are regarded by the international community as\r\n\r\na region that is plagued by disputes and instability, and\r\n\r\none  that  breeds Islamic radicals, this would  undermine\r\n\r\ninvestor confidence and affect our future development  as\r\n\r\nindividual  countries and as a region.  Such  an  outcome\r\n\r\nwill make it all the harder for leaders in this region to\r\n\r\nwin  the support of their people against the more extreme\r\n\r\nIslamic  political groups offering an alternative  vision\r\n\r\nof a spiritual society, withdrawn from the secular modern\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing popularity of Islamic parties around the\r\n\r\nworld, such as in Turkey and Pakistan, in the face of the\r\n\r\nUS-led  war  on  terrorism  -  a  war  often  painted  by\r\n\r\nIslamic  political opportunists as anti-Islam  -   points\r\n\r\nto the challenge that this region faces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is another complication that we in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have to watch out for, and that is the  latent\r\n\r\nanti-American sentiment in some quarters in  the  region.\r\n\r\nIt  can  be easily whipped up and exploited by those  who\r\n\r\nwant  to play to their domestic Muslim gallery.   Add  to\r\n\r\nthis  the tensions created by a possible war on Iraq  and\r\n\r\nthe picture for the region looks even more uncertain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America has become the big issue in the war against\r\n\r\nterrorism,  when  the issue should  be  rooting  out  the\r\n\r\nterrorists  and halting the rise of militant Islam.   The\r\n\r\ngrowing anti-Americanism, if not checked, will only  make\r\n\r\nit  easier  to  recruit  young men for  suicide  missions\r\n\r\nagainst   US  and  Western  targets  around  the   world,\r\n\r\nincluding in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have to make sure our own society\r\n\r\nknows where its national\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterests  lie and protect it.  We may not  always  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  US  and,  indeed, we have disagreed  with  the\r\n\r\nsuperpower on several occasions in international forums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International law and the legitimacy of the UN are\r\n\r\nimportant  to Singapore, especially since it is  a  small\r\n\r\nstate.  But even as we discuss the merits or demerits, or\r\n\r\nthe  rightness  or  wrongness of a possible  war  against\r\n\r\nIraq, Singaporeans, as individuals and groups, must guard\r\n\r\nagainst anti-US feelings taking hold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's decision must be made on the basis\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's  national interest, and  that  means  the\r\n\r\ncollective interest of all Singaporeans.  If a  war  does\r\n\r\nindeed   take   place  against  Iraq,   there   will   be\r\n\r\nrepercussions  in  the Southeast Asian region,  which  is\r\n\r\npredominantly  Muslim,  and we  should  prepare  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious scenarios.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Singaporeans face a challenge from two\r\n\r\nperspectives.   For Muslims, the ongoing debate  is  what\r\n\r\ninterpretation of Islam will dominate, how  to  reconcile\r\n\r\nit  with modernity and a secular multi-racial state.  For\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims,  it is how to negotiate a common  space  and\r\n\r\nhow to accommodate the concerns of Muslims in building  a\r\n\r\nnational way of life, in which all are equal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to show that our pluralistic and tolerant\r\n\r\nway  of  life is superior to the one offered  by  extreme\r\n\r\nIslamic  groups.   That  our way of  life  is  not  about\r\n\r\nreducing  everything to economic growth but is  a  humane\r\n\r\none, based on justice and equality.  That our way of life\r\n\r\nmakes room for a diversity of religions, but rejects  the\r\n\r\nreligion of oppression and violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a positive thing that progressive debates\r\n\r\nabout  Islam are taking place in Singapore.  Such debates\r\n\r\nare  also  ongoing  in  neighbouring  countries.   It  is\r\n\r\nhelpful  to observe the regional debate so as to be  able\r\n\r\nto  counter over-simplified arguments of many Muslims and\r\n\r\ncritics  of  Islam, maintaining that the Quran prescribes\r\n\r\nthis or that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the discussion of Islam in modernity\r\n\r\nshould   not   be   restricted  only  to  religious   and\r\n\r\nintellectual  circles.   It  is  worth  noting  that   in\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries, there is  an  active  discussion\r\n\r\namong  different Muslim groups on human  rights  and  the\r\n\r\nwomen's  role  in  Islam.  They include  groups  such  as\r\n\r\nMalaysia's   Sisters  of  Islam,  a   group   of   Muslim\r\n\r\nprofessional women committed to promoting the  rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen within the framework of Islam, and also the women's\r\n\r\nwing  of  the biggest moderate Muslim group in Indonesia,\r\n\r\nNahdlatul  Ulama.   The  women's  wing,  called  Muslimat\r\n\r\nNahdlatul Ulama, seeks to empower Muslim women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard women leaders from these groups\r\n\r\nspeak.   Their underlying argument is that not  only  the\r\n\r\nulamas  have the right to codify the text of  the  Quran,\r\n\r\nand  that  interpretations should not  be  isolated  from\r\n\r\nhistorical   and   socio-cultural   context,   especially\r\n\r\nregarding  women  and contemporary society.   They  argue\r\n\r\nagainst the use of religion to justify cultural practices\r\n\r\nand  values that regard women as inferior and subordinate\r\n\r\nto  men.   They believe that this has been made  possible\r\n\r\nbecause   men  have  had  exclusive  control   over   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the text of the Quran.   This  is  what\r\n\r\nthese Muslim women in these countries have been saying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it is imperative that the progressive\r\n\r\nvoices  of  Muslim  women be also heard  in  the  ongoing\r\n\r\ndebate on the interpretation of Islam.  Battling militant\r\n\r\nIslam  is  not the only responsibility of the  State  but\r\n\r\nalso  of the civil society, both Islamic and non-Islamic,\r\n\r\ninvolving both men and women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we are under threat from\r\n\r\nterrorism,  and we must combat it; there  is  no  denying\r\n\r\nthat.

In  recent  years,\r\n\r\nhowever,  in  percentage  terms,  synthetic  drugs   have\r\n\r\ndisplaced heroin as the main drug of abuse amongst  young\r\n\r\nabusers  below  the age of 20. 61% of the young  arrested\r\n\r\nlast  year  were abusers of synthetic drugs, compared  to\r\n\r\n37% of them being heroin abusers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to compile a profile of young drug\r\n\r\nabusers. This is because youths from all backgrounds find\r\n\r\nthemselves  tempted to try synthetic  drugs.  Such  \"club\r\n\r\ndrugs\"  are  touted  as being hip and harmless  when,  in\r\n\r\nfact, they are harmful and potentially even fatal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)\r\n\r\nspearheads   a   wide   range  of  preventive   education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  spread the anti-drug message  to  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum  of  our youths. Let me outline  some  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the school front, CNB conducts talks to\r\n\r\nstudents   on  the  dangers  of  drugs.  CNB   has   also\r\n\r\nintroduced anti-drug messages into the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nVisits  are  conducted  to  Drug  Rehabilitation  Centres\r\n\r\n(DRCs)  to  warn youths of the dangers and  penalties  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse. More recently, NCADA launched a  new  online\r\n\r\npreventive drug education tool called David's Diary. This\r\n\r\nhas been well utilised and received by schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCADA also supports the PAL programme under the\r\n\r\nSingapore Anti-Narcotics Association which aims to  reach\r\n\r\nout  to  out-of-school youths. In 2001, an estimated  600\r\n\r\nyouths  received  assistance  under  the  programme.  140\r\n\r\neventually  returned to school while  others  managed  to\r\n\r\nfind employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for synthetic drug abuse which is associated\r\n\r\nwith  the  nightlife and entertainment outlets frequented\r\n\r\nby  youths, NCADA, over the past two years, has partnered\r\n\r\nthe  management  of  clubs to conduct  an  annual  \"Clubs\r\n\r\nAgainst  Drugs\"  campaign  to communicate  the  anti-drug\r\n\r\nmessage to club-goers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that these efforts have\r\n\r\nbeen  successful.  The  number of  youths  below  age  20\r\n\r\narrested for drug abuse has declined from the peak of 679\r\n\r\nin  1993 to 203 in 2002*, a significant drop of 70%.  The\r\n\r\nproblem   is  under  control.   Nevertheless,  MHA   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to work with the community and the  schools  to\r\n\r\ninstill an attitude of zero tolerance towards drug  abuse\r\n\r\namongst our youths.\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Figure for 2002 is provisional.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RENTAL FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development if he will  (a) give a breakdown  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  number of Housing and Development Board  one- and  two-room rental flats in Singapore;  (b) state  what\r\n\r\nis  the trend in the demand for such flats over the  last\r\n\r\nfive  years; and (c) provide a profile of the tenants  in\r\n\r\nterms of age, marital status, sex and occupation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB rental flats are meant for Singaporean\r\n\r\nhouseholds  with monthly incomes not exceeding  $800  who\r\n\r\nare  financially not ready or unable to afford their  own\r\n\r\nflats.
