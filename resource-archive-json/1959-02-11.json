Such  damage is not a  punitive  penalty  of\r\n\r\nnegligence but the result is the curious position  that\r\n\r\nit   is   cheaper  to  kill  the  provident  than   the\r\n\r\nimprovident;  or, putting it in another way,  the  wise\r\n\r\nprecaution of the provident man in insuring himself for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of his widow or children may be of no real\r\n\r\nbenefit to them; they may not benefit from the premiums\r\n\r\nhe  has  already  paid. That this was  inequitable  was\r\n\r\nrecognized in the Federation some three years ago,  and\r\n\r\nin  England as long as fifty years ago. It is,  both  I\r\n\r\nand  the Bar Committee think, time that Singapore  gave\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  the providence of  insurance  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment proposed by clause 2 (b) of this\r\n\r\nBill  provides  for dependants to be  able  to  recover\r\n\r\nfuneral  expenses which they themselves incurred  where\r\n\r\nthey  are parties to the action for their recovery.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  such expenses are only recoverable where  the\r\n\r\naction  is brought on behalf of the estate.

It has been\r\n\r\nbriefly  stated in the Explanatory Statement  appended\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill  which  has been in the  hands  of  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.  The  Bill  seeks  to  make  what  might   be\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  a technical amendment to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction   Ordinance.  Part  XIII  of  the   Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  contains  provisions  relating  to   public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles. These provisions do  not,  however,\r\n\r\napply  to the public service vehicles of the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company. The operations of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  S.T.C. vehicles  are regulated  by  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in quite a separate Ordinance - the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Ordinance  (Chapter 111),  and  section  52,\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  of  the Singapore Traction  Ordinance\r\n\r\nspecifically provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The provisions of Part XIII of the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  relating to hackneyed carriages  and  carts\r\n\r\nshall not apply to cars as defined by this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  House  will  know that  Part  XIII  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance has been repealed, and  has  been\r\n\r\nreplaced   by   Part  XII  of  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Part XII subsequently re-enacts the provisions\r\n\r\nrelating   to   public  service  vehicles   previously\r\n\r\ncontained in the Municipal Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording of section 52, subsection (2) of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Ordinance  has  therefore  become\r\n\r\nobsolete,  and  in  order to remove any  doubts  which\r\n\r\nmight   arise,  it  is  now  proposed  to  amend   the\r\n\r\nsubsection by substituting an up-to-date wording.  All\r\n\r\nthat  the  amending Bill seeks to do is to  substitute\r\n\r\nfor  the  words \"Part XIII of the Municipal Ordinance\"\r\n\r\nthe words \"Part XII of the Local Government Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other section in the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance, 1957, which might be  construed\r\n\r\nas  being  in  conflict  with the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Ordinance.  It  is  section  131.\r\n\r\nSection  131  of the Local Government Ordinance,  Sir,\r\n\r\nempowers the local authority to levy taxes on vehicles\r\n\r\nkept  or habitually used within the area of the  local\r\n\r\nauthority.   Section  132  of  the  Local   Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance, however, provides that this power cannot be\r\n\r\nexercised in respect of whatever vehicles are licensed\r\n\r\nor registered or exempt from licensing or registration\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance. It\r\n\r\nwill  be  noted  that exemptions  must  be  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Road Traffic Ordinance.  Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  vehicles  of the Singapore Traction  Company  are\r\n\r\nexempt  from the licensing and registration under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance; but such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexemptions  do not arise under the provisions  of  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  It arises rather by virtue of  the  special\r\n\r\nexemption  contained in section 52, subsection  (1)  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Traction Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible, therefore, for an argument to be\r\n\r\nadvanced that since the exemption of S.T.C. vehicles is\r\n\r\nnot under the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance,\r\n\r\na  strict  interpretation of section 131 of  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Ordinance would empower a local authority to\r\n\r\nlevy  taxes  on such vehicles. In order to  remove  any\r\n\r\ndoubts  on  this clause, Sir, it is proposed  that  the\r\n\r\namendment  to  section  52,  subsection  (2)   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Ordinance, should  also  expressly\r\n\r\nprovide   for  the  exemption  of  Singapore   Traction\r\n\r\nvehicles  from  the provisions of section  131  of  the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.34 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  Minister  for Communications  and  Works\r\n\r\nreminded  us that this amendment is merely a  technical\r\n\r\namendment,  I wish to ask the Minister why he  did  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  opportunity  to amend  the  many  privileges\r\n\r\nconferred on the Singapore Traction Company during  the\r\n\r\nlife of the previous government.

It is proposed to amend certain sections of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance in the light of eight years' experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that the definition of \"proprietor\"\r\n\r\nin section 2 of the Ordinance has proved inadequate for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of charging principals in the  Courts  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  breach of the law,  as  it  is  often\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   ascertain  who  the  manager   of   an\r\n\r\nentertainment   is.  Under  the  Public  Entertainments\r\n\r\nOrdinance, it is incumbent on any person who  organises\r\n\r\na  public entertainment to obtain a police licence, and\r\n\r\nit  is proposed that such licensee should also be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible  in  respect  of any  offence  against  the\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Duty  Ordinance,  and  any  rules  made\r\n\r\nthereunder. The proprietor is so defined as to  include\r\n\r\nthe licensee of a public entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major amendment relates to section 4 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance. It will be recalled that at the meeting\r\n\r\nheld on the 18th December, 1951, the former Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil passed a resolution under section 4 (1) of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   levying  half-duty  in  respect   of   live\r\n\r\nentertainment.  It  is  proposed  to  incorporate  this\r\n\r\nprovision in the proposed amendment in clause 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 2 of the Ordinance, entertainment is\r\n\r\ndefined  as  including  \"any  exhibition,  performance,\r\n\r\namusement,  games  or  sport,  to  which  persons   are\r\n\r\nadmitted on payment\". Since the enactment of the  above\r\n\r\nresolution,  the  various  Singapore  amusement  parks,\r\n\r\nknown  as the \"Worlds\", have paid full duty in  respect\r\n\r\nof  admission  charges. Whilst  an  amusement  park  is\r\n\r\ncertainly an entertainment as defined in section  2  of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance, there is some doubt whether it might not\r\n\r\nbe   held   to  be  included  among  those   forms   of\r\n\r\nentertainment  which, by virtue of the proviso  to  the\r\n\r\nresolution referring to live entertainment, are charged\r\n\r\nduty  at  half-rate. It was certainly not the intention\r\n\r\nthat the amusement parks should pay only half-duty, and\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  is  therefore taken  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the open-air cinemas has been under\r\n\r\nexamination.  At the moment, there are 22 such  cinemas\r\n\r\noperating  in  the rural areas and three in  the  city.\r\n\r\nThey  cater  mainly  for persons in  the  lower  income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup,  such as farmers, fishermen, manual workers  and\r\n\r\nstudents. The popular prices are 50 cents, 30 cents and\r\n\r\n20  cents,  on  which duty leviable is respectively  15\r\n\r\ncents,  10  cents and 5 cents. The operator is  usually\r\n\r\nleft  with a nett of 15 cents to 35 cents to  meet  his\r\n\r\noverhead  expenditure,  which may  come  to  $3,000  or\r\n\r\n$3,500  per month. The open-air cinemas do not  receive\r\n\r\nincome from advertisements as do the other big cinemas.\r\n\r\nThey are subject to the vagaries of the weather. On the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother   hand,   they  are  meeting   the   demand   for\r\n\r\nentertainment  which  will  not  be  supplied  by   the\r\n\r\nordinary  cinema  operator.  In  that  sense  they  are\r\n\r\nproviding a social amenity to the community.  They  are\r\n\r\nin  most  cases working under difficult conditions  and\r\n\r\noften suffer losses. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  thought that there is a case for relief  in\r\n\r\nthis   instance,  and  the  Government  has  therefore\r\n\r\ndecided  to  grant relief to the extent  of  remitting\r\n\r\nhalf-duty  in  respect of these  open-air  cinemas.  I\r\n\r\npropose, Sir, to move an amendment to section 4 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in Committee. A notice to this  effect  has\r\n\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dance, as such, is not liable to entertainment duty,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is however necessary to ensure that,  if  the\r\n\r\nproprietor of a restaurant or ballroom charges  a  fee\r\n\r\nfor  admission, and thereafter stages a floor show  or\r\n\r\nseveral floor shows lasting for more than half an hour\r\n\r\nin  the  aggregate, duty should be  charged  upon  the\r\n\r\nadmission  fee.  The proposed amendment  in  clause  4\r\n\r\nrelating to section 10 of the Ordinance is designed to\r\n\r\nthis end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, not all officers of the Customs Department\r\n\r\nhave   authority  to  inspect  places  connected  with\r\n\r\nentertainments where tickets are surreptitiously  sold\r\n\r\nin advance for entertainments to be held later. Senior\r\n\r\nofficers  of  Customs are permitted  to  inspect  only\r\n\r\n\"places  of entertainment\" or \"places ordinarily  used\r\n\r\nas  places  of entertainment\". All other  places  even\r\n\r\nthough  they  are  connected with  entertainments  are\r\n\r\nimmune    from    inspection.   In    addition,    the\r\n\r\nEntertainments Duty Ordinance requires  such  officers\r\n\r\nto   inspect   places  of  entertainment   while   the\r\n\r\nentertainment is in progress, thus making it difficult\r\n\r\nto detect offences which are usually committed shortly\r\n\r\nbefore  the  performance.  As  it  is  imperative   to\r\n\r\nassociate  the  junior  Customs  officers   in   these\r\n\r\ninspections,  the proposed amendment in  clause  5  is\r\n\r\ndesigned to enable an officer of Customs to enter  and\r\n\r\ninspect   at  all  reasonable  times  any   place   of\r\n\r\nentertainment, any place ordinarily used as a place of\r\n\r\nentertainment,   as  well  as  any  other   place   he\r\n\r\nreasonably   suspects   to  be   connected   with   an\r\n\r\nentertainment. Similarly it is proposed in  clause  7,\r\n\r\nwhich  amends section 15 of the Ordinance,  to  extend\r\n\r\nthe  powers  given to a senior Customs officer  to  an\r\n\r\n\"officer   of  Customs\"  in  respect  of  seizure   of\r\n\r\ndocuments.  The inspection of places of  entertainment\r\n\r\nnecessitates   almost  simultaneous  checks   at   the\r\n\r\nadmission gates (usually two or more) the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbox  office as well as the manager's office from where\r\n\r\ndocuments  relating  to  the  entertainment   can   be\r\n\r\nobtained.  Revenue officers of the Customs  Department\r\n\r\nshould  therefore  be  given  powers  to  seize   such\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends section 22 of the Ordinance by\r\n\r\nextending the authority given to a \"senior officer  of\r\n\r\nCustoms\"  to  an \"officer of Customs\"  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 (2) of the Ordinance makes it mandatory for\r\n\r\nan arrested person to be taken to a police station. As\r\n\r\nthis  subsection now stands, taking such person  to  a\r\n\r\ncustoms station would constitute an unlawful act.  The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment in clause 6 will make  section  14\r\n\r\n(2) of the Ordinance fall in line with section 31 (2)\r\n\r\nof  the  Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, where an  arrested\r\n\r\nperson may be taken either to a police station or to a\r\n\r\ncustoms  station,  and  with section  87  (2)  of  the\r\n\r\nCustoms   Ordinance   which  also  makes   alternative\r\n\r\nprovision for the custody of arrested persons  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of a proper officer of Customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 introduces two new sections - 17A and 17B.\r\n\r\nSection  17A provides for the compounding of  offences\r\n\r\nso  as  to save the time of the Courts from having  to\r\n\r\ndeal with purely technical and minor offences. Section\r\n\r\n17B  enables  senior  officers of Customs  to  conduct\r\n\r\nprosecutions under the Entertainments Duty Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 introduces a new section 19A making attempts\r\n\r\nand  abetments  of offences punishable with  the  same\r\n\r\npunishment  as offences. This new section  will  bring\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance in line with section 111 of the Customs\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  section  33  of  the  Dangerous  Drugs\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-[Mr Oon Khye Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 14, after \"to\", to insert \"any open\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air cinema or\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this amendment is to concede half-duty to the open air cinema for the reasons as given in\r\n\r\nmy speech on the Second Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 10 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an Amendment; read the Third time\r\n\r\nand passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 8 of 1959)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.54 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation\r\n\r\nto proceed with the motion; I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $735,672\r\n\r\nshall be supplied to the Government under the heads  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  for  the services  specified  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  contained in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  8  of\r\n\r\n1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Schedule consists of a list of six\r\n\r\napplications  for supplementary provision amounting  to\r\n\r\n$735,672. The reasons for these supplementary votes are\r\n\r\ngiven in detail in the Sessional Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two items which involve a substantial sum\r\n\r\nof  money. One of them refers to a revision of salaries\r\n\r\nof   the   midwives.  The  Singapore  Midwives'   Union\r\n\r\noriginally  claimed in early 1956 that  these  midwives\r\n\r\nshould be on the same salary scale as that of qualified\r\n\r\nnurses;  but  this  claim  could  not  be  accepted  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  had to be submitted to arbitration  in\r\n\r\nMarch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1957,  in  accordance  with the  Arbitration  Agreement\r\n\r\nexecuted  between the Official and Staff  Side  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service  Joint  Council. In  November  1957  the\r\n\r\nTribunal made an award that midwives should be given  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  increase  to  their  salaries,  the  exact\r\n\r\namount  of  which  was  to  be negotiated  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Union and to be effective  from  1st\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1957. As no agreement could be reached  after\r\n\r\nsix  months'  negotiation, the Tribunal was  reconvened\r\n\r\nand  fixed  the  salary  on the timescale  of  $168-8A-200/bar/220-10A-270 in December, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salary scale was actually Government's last\r\n\r\noffer  to  the Union. The Government and the Union  had\r\n\r\nconscientiously  sought to reach a settlement  of  this\r\n\r\ndispute  during  negotiation. It was  not  possible  to\r\n\r\nagree  to  pay the midwives at a rate higher than  that\r\n\r\ndesigned  for  them and similar grades in  the  general\r\n\r\nrevision  of  Civil Service salaries.  Any  substantial\r\n\r\ndeparture would disrupt the overall salary structure of\r\n\r\nthe public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new salary scale gives a very substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  from  10  per cent to 27 per  cent  over  the\r\n\r\nmidwives'   existing   salaries.   It   compares   very\r\n\r\nfavourably  with that paid by the City Council  and  to\r\n\r\nother  grades of Government servant, and compares  more\r\n\r\nthan  favourably  with the salaries  which  prospective\r\n\r\nmidwives  could command from commercial  or  industrial\r\n\r\nemployers.  The  additional annually  recurrent  costs,\r\n\r\nassuming  that all the posts are filled, of  paying  at\r\n\r\nthe  new  rate, would be $92,000. There is, again,  the\r\n\r\nadditional  cost  of  payment of  arrears  and  Central\r\n\r\nProvident   Fund   contributions  at   the   new   rate\r\n\r\nretrospectively  from 1st February,  1957.  Altogether,\r\n\r\n$202,000 will be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big item is the revote of $499,867 to meet\r\n\r\nthe  cost to be borne by Government in connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  Exposition  at  Kallang.

The vote is not the actual cost of  putting\r\n\r\nup  the  railings. It has been proposed  that  the  old\r\n\r\nrailings which surrounded the Girl Guides' Home will be\r\n\r\nused and repainted. So this $20,000 is not the cost  of\r\n\r\nputting  up  the new railings. It is the  old  railings\r\n\r\nwhich  are to be erected there and painted.

They try to make  political\r\n\r\ncapital  out of every move that the Government  makes.\r\n\r\nOn  the Second Reading of the Bill, it was pointed out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the purpose of amending the Entertainments  Duty\r\n\r\nOrdinance is just to tighten up the Ordinance  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the loopholes are properly blocked. There is  no\r\n\r\nchange  whatsoever  in the rate of entertainment  duty\r\n\r\nthat  is  to be levied under this motion, as has  been\r\n\r\nlevied   for  many  years.  But  there  is  just   one\r\n\r\nsignificant  change. In the case of open-air  cinemas,\r\n\r\nthe entertainment tax is now reduced to half; that  is\r\n\r\nto  say,  the operators of open-air cinemas  need  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  the  same rates of tax  as  first-class\r\n\r\ncinemas  and  other covered cinemas. In  the  case  of\r\n\r\namusement   parks,  they  have  already  been   paying\r\n\r\nentertainment  duty, and the amendment  is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they have to pay the full entertainment duty  and\r\n\r\nnot half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I have His Excellency the Governor's consent  to\r\n\r\nproceed with this Bill. I beg to move, \"That the  Bill\r\n\r\nbe now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill follows closely the Local Government\r\n\r\nElections  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  1959,  which   was\r\n\r\ndebated  and passed by this House at its last sitting.\r\n\r\nExcept  for  one or two new clauses to which  I  shall\r\n\r\nrefer  later,  most of the clauses in  this  Bill  are\r\n\r\nidentical with those of the Local Government Elections\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Ordinance, and I need not refer to them at\r\n\r\nany  length  beyond stating that this Bill  implements\r\n\r\nthe  same recommendations of the Elias Commission with\r\n\r\nthe   object   of   eliminating  malpractices   during\r\n\r\nelections. It provides for the preparation of combined\r\n\r\nregisters,  and  introduces  similar  provisions   for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting  and  the imposition  of  sanctions\r\n\r\nagainst electors who fail to record their votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other Ordinance, this Bill also makes a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  amendments of an administrative character,\r\n\r\nsuch as removing requirements for the publication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  newspapers of various election notices,  extension\r\n\r\nof time for preparing the claims list from four to ten\r\n\r\ndays, and also provision for regulating the display of\r\n\r\nposters  and  banners by candidates in respect  of  an\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new clause which is not included in the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance is clause 3. Section  5  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Colony  (Electoral  Provisions)  Order   in\r\n\r\nCouncil,  1958,  lays  down  the  qualifications   for\r\n\r\nmembership  of  the  first  Assembly  under  the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Subsection  (1)  (a)  of  that  section\r\n\r\nstates  that  the  candidate for election  must  be  a\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore who- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"is of or above such age and\r\n\r\npossesses  such  residence qualifications  as  may  be\r\n\r\nprescribed  by  or  under  the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly Elections Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill now makes provision for the\r\n\r\nage  and residence qualifications. The qualifying  age\r\n\r\nis   put  at  21  years  or  upwards  on  the  day  of\r\n\r\nnomination.   No  residence  qualification   will   be\r\n\r\nrequired  for  persons born in Malaya, but  for  those\r\n\r\nborn    outside   Malaya,   a   Singapore    residence\r\n\r\nqualification of eight out of ten years  is  required.\r\n\r\nResidence  in  Singapore on the day of nomination  for\r\n\r\nelection  is made a further stipulation. I next  refer\r\n\r\nto clause 7, which provides that persons who have been\r\n\r\ndeprived of their Singapore citizenship shall not vote\r\n\r\nat  elections. This removes any doubt arising from the\r\n\r\nfact  that under the existing provisions of the parent\r\n\r\nOrdinance  persons registered as citizens  during  the\r\n\r\ninitial  registration  period were  entitled  to  have\r\n\r\ntheir  names  included  in  the  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nelectoral rolls for the forthcoming election by virtue\r\n\r\nof such registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 has also been drafted so as to provide that\r\n\r\nbefore   the   Legislative  electoral  registers   are\r\n\r\ncertified, the Registration Officer shall from time to\r\n\r\ntime  expunge from the registers the names of  persons\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  their citizenship, notwithstanding  that\r\n\r\nthe claims and objections period has expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 similarly provides that before\r\n\r\ncertification of revised registers, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistration Officer shall from time to time on  being\r\n\r\ninformed   by  the  Registrar  of  Citizens  similarly\r\n\r\nexpunge names of persons deprived of their citizenship\r\n\r\nduring the period when revision of the registers takes\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause, Sir, which I would like to mention\r\n\r\nis   clause  15.  Clause  15  (b)  follows  a  similar\r\n\r\namendment  made  to  the  Local  Government  Elections\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Ordinance, 1959. Section 37 (2)  of  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance goes further than the corresponding  Section\r\n\r\n37 (2) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance\r\n\r\nin that the words - I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or who, by reason of circumstances existing on the\r\n\r\nday   of  the  election  is  not,  by  virtue  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section  5 or  6  of  this  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nentitled to have his name entered or retained  in  any\r\n\r\nregister of electors,\"- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>are not included in section 37\r\n\r\n(2)  of  the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore proposed by clause 15 to amend section\r\n\r\n37  of  the  parent Ordinance in order to  bring  this\r\n\r\nprovision into line with the similar provision in  the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Elections Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17, Sir, provides for compulsory voting and\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  in that clause are similar  to  those\r\n\r\nalready  approved  in  the Local Government  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance   with  the  exception  of  one   additional\r\n\r\nprovision,  that is subsection (3) of the new  section\r\n\r\n41A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest, quickest and cheapest way in which to\r\n\r\nprepare  a  list  of  those who did  not  vote  at  an\r\n\r\nelection, as required in subsection (2), is to use the\r\n\r\nmarked  copies  of the registers used at  the  polling\r\n\r\nstations.  But  as  the Ordinance stands  at  present,\r\n\r\nthese marked copies have to be sealed by the Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficer immediately after the poll - section 46 (1)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  refers - and they have to  be  counter-sealed by the Returning Officer immediately after  the\r\n\r\ndeclaration   of  the  results  of  the  election   in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  requirement  of   section   47\r\n\r\nsubsection  (9) of the Ordinance. The purpose  of  the\r\n\r\namendment in the new subsection (3) of section 41A  is\r\n\r\nto  enable the Returning Officer to have access to the\r\n\r\nmarked  copies of the registers by breaking the  seals\r\n\r\naffixed  by  the  Presiding  Officer  to  the  package\r\n\r\ncontaining these marked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncopies, for the purpose of inspecting them with a  view\r\n\r\nto  the  preparation of the lists of those who did  not\r\n\r\nvote, as provided for in subsection (2) of section 41A.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  why  marked copies of  the  registers  are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsealed up with the other documents used at the poll  is\r\n\r\nsolely  for  the purpose of enabling a scrutiny  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  as  a result of an election petition. The secrecy\r\n\r\nof  the ballot will not be violated in any way if these\r\n\r\nmarked copies of the registers are not sealed up.  They\r\n\r\ngive  no  indication of how any individual has in  fact\r\n\r\nvoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments I have just explained show the\r\n\r\nimportant aspects of this Bill in so far as they differ\r\n\r\nfrom  the  provisions of the Local Government Elections\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage of the Bill I shall be moving\r\n\r\nseveral  amendments of which I have given notice.  Some\r\n\r\nof  these amendments are mainly of a drafting nature or\r\n\r\nmade  for  clarification purposes. I will  explain  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for the other amendments, Sir, when  they  are\r\n\r\nmoved in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to conclude, Sir, by saying that\r\n\r\nthe  primary  object of this Bill is  to  ensure  clean\r\n\r\nelections,  but the House and the public  must  realise\r\n\r\nthat  enacting  legislation  of  this  kind  will   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  by itself solve this problem. Whether  the\r\n\r\nlaw  is  obeyed or not depends basically on the respect\r\n\r\nin  which  that  law  is held by  the  public,  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular  by  that  section of the  public  which  is\r\n\r\nespecially affected by these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it becomes necessary to enforce any of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this law, the police will of  course  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  impartial. But I hope that  in  discharging\r\n\r\nthis  difficult task, they will receive full assistance\r\n\r\nand  co-operation from all political parties  and  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public.  Action  by  the  police  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  by  the courts can only be  remedial  and\r\n\r\ncannot  in  itself  prevent the  disease.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming elections to the new Assembly will be  free\r\n\r\nof malpractices will depend primarily on the respect in\r\n\r\nwhich this law is held by all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have on my table notes of certain\r\n\r\namendments  which  are to be moved,  I  understand,  in\r\n\r\nCommittee stage, and of which no notice has been given.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, this is the proper time for me to suspend this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly  to consider whether or not I should  give  my\r\n\r\nconsent  to  these amendments being moved,  because  in\r\n\r\ngiving  my consent, I will of course have to take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  interests of the  minority  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.

Sir, I would like to say something more  on\r\n\r\nthis  subject on which I dwelt at great length  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech  at  the last sitting when debating  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Elections (Amendment)  Bill  in  order  to\r\n\r\nclear  away  the political apathy of this  country.  I\r\n\r\nprefer  not  to take up too much of the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse but I would like to emphasise two points on this\r\n\r\nquestion of malpractices during elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people of Singapore think that only\r\n\r\nthose politicians who are prepared to accept money  or\r\n\r\nany material reward are guilty of malpractices, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is better to let the public know  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion of malpractices is not only confined to those\r\n\r\ncorrupt  politicians  who receive  money  or  material\r\n\r\nreward  like the acceptance of a few bottles of brandy\r\n\r\nor  free transport during elections, but also to those\r\n\r\npoliticians  guilty  of  moral  corruption  and  power\r\n\r\ncorruption.  I  am  sure that  this  is  not  properly\r\n\r\nunderstood  by  the masses because they  have  already\r\n\r\nbeen   led   to  believe  that  only  the   Right-wing\r\n\r\npoliticians  are  corrupt  and  that  any   politician\r\n\r\nprofessing   himself   to   be   a   Left-winger    is\r\n\r\nincorruptible.  They are led to believe  that  such  a\r\n\r\nperson does not like cash gifts or a present of a  few\r\n\r\nbottles   of   brandy  and  that   therefore   he   is\r\n\r\nincorruptible. Sir, it is high time for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to open their eyes as to why they are to  be\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  vote. The public should know  that  the\r\n\r\nLeft-wingers  are  also  guilty  of  certain   corrupt\r\n\r\npractices. They may have many secrets but those  close\r\n\r\nto  them  know  that  this is no longer  a  secret - the\r\n\r\nmisappropriation of union funds. How are  such  unions\r\n\r\nrun?  How  are the accounts of such unions audited?  I\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to lay the blame on the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare whose duty it is to  check  every\r\n\r\nunion's accounts and to see that the hard-earned money\r\n\r\nof  the  poor worker is not put to a wrongful purpose.\r\n\r\nThe  unscrupulous and opportunist politician  says  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  \"Oh,  I  will  provide  everything  for\r\n\r\nyou - even the moon,\" and yet he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis considered an incorruptible Left-winger. The people\r\n\r\nare  led  to  believe  that  all  Socialists  and  all\r\n\r\nLeftists in this country are incorruptible. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nhigh  time for the people to open their eyes that  the\r\n\r\nmalpractices  in elections extend to moral  corruption\r\n\r\nand power corruption. If on the one hand we agree that\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing  party  always  gets  the  support  of\r\n\r\nwealthy persons and that it will therefore be able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  free  drinks,  free transportation  and  even\r\n\r\nindulging in gangsterism, on the other hand, the Left-wing  party  organises  picnic  parties  where  for  a\r\n\r\ncontribution of 50 cents a person can spend a few days\r\n\r\nin  a beautiful bungalow with nice scenery and receive\r\n\r\npolitical indoctrination. Who are the sponsors of such\r\n\r\ngoings - on and where does the money come from?  Many  a\r\n\r\ntime I have emphasised this point. We believe that the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  should survive  in  this  country.\r\n\r\nUnfair political activities should be avoided. We  are\r\n\r\nnot  inexperienced to know that lies and  hatred  have\r\n\r\nbeen  implanted  in the minds of the innocent  masses.\r\n\r\nThere  are  politicians  who look  after  their  party\r\n\r\ninterests  and  also their personal  glorification  by\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Oh, I am the champion of the poor. I  am  the\r\n\r\nchampion  of  the workers.\" Such politicians  stir  up\r\n\r\nemotional  feeling  among the poor workers.  And  then\r\n\r\nhatred  is implanted in their minds. The rich and  the\r\n\r\npoor are clearly divided in Singapore today, and while\r\n\r\nthese  politicians know too well that Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\ncommercial port and that if it has to survive  it  has\r\n\r\nto  rely  on  the entrepot trade, yet they  prefer  to\r\n\r\ndestroy the economy of Singapore because they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to lose the popularity that they enjoy as leaders\r\n\r\nof  political parties. This is another form  of  moral\r\n\r\ncorruption. They cheat and lie to the masses by trying\r\n\r\nto  create  in their minds a distinction  between  the\r\n\r\nrich  and  the  poor. The people are told,  \"The  rich\r\n\r\nalways  exploit the poor cold-bloodedly, and therefore\r\n\r\nwe  must  unite all the poor against the  rich.\"  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are many theoreticians and learned scholars  in\r\n\r\nsuch political parties and they know the actual number\r\n\r\nof  poor people in Singapore and because of this  fact\r\n\r\nthey realise that the easiest way of getting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvotes  to put them into power is to cheat and  lie  to\r\n\r\nthese poor people. Sir, this is the most disgusting of\r\n\r\nall political sins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning we touched on the subject of the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  The Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said  he\r\n\r\nwould  not be satisfied unless the Government  gave  a\r\n\r\nfull  explanation of why the new stamps  were  printed\r\n\r\nwith  pictures  showing  the  new  Constitution  as  a\r\n\r\nstepping-stone to merger. Sir, I remember saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  present  Constitution is a  stumbling, block  to\r\n\r\nbuilding the unity of our people. Everyone of  us  has\r\n\r\nto admit that the Lennox-Boyd Constitution has divided\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation into two distinct  parts,\r\n\r\nand  yet  we  talk of the unification  of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  What  about  the Bornean  territories  and\r\n\r\nSarawak? These politicians are only telling lies! They\r\n\r\ndo not tell the people that they only want to seek the\r\n\r\nquickest  way  to step into power, and therefore  they\r\n\r\nquickly make us believe that something is better  than\r\n\r\nnothing  and  that they do not want to  be  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  or  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of  all these political  adventurers  and\r\n\r\nopportunists and those engaged in malpractices  during\r\n\r\nelections should be restricted, because they tell lies\r\n\r\nand they refuse to tell the truth to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now happy that the Singapore People's\r\n\r\nAlliance - although it is called the Rojak Party, yet it\r\n\r\nis very tasteful - has introduced this Bill in time for\r\n\r\nthe new Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill contains many detailed clauses on how\r\n\r\nelections  are  to be carried out. I just  wonder  how\r\n\r\nmany of us here sincerely believe that every clause in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  will be carried out truly and  honestly.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  in  the  last  debate on  the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nElections  (Amendment) Bill that compulsory voting  is\r\n\r\nthe only hope to Singapore's stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill at least political Parties have\r\n\r\ncertain  assurances against malpractices. We will  not\r\n\r\ncontinue  with such malpractices on a big  scale.  The\r\n\r\npolitical  apathy of the middle-aged  and  the  middle\r\n\r\nclass will then be stirred at what happened during the\r\n\r\nlast  elections,  for example, the last  City  Council\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take this golden opportunity to\r\n\r\nappeal  to all the journalists in Singapore  to  weigh\r\n\r\nwell  the  importance  of the coming  elections.  They\r\n\r\nshould  bear  in  mind that their  personal  political\r\n\r\ninclinations and beliefs should be put aside, and they\r\n\r\nshould    make   an   honest,   frank,    just,    and\r\n\r\nstraightforward report, because this is going to  play\r\n\r\na  very,  very important part in the coming elections.\r\n\r\nFrom  time  to  time,  we hear of complaints  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly - they are not new - that certain reporters  have\r\n\r\ntwisted the facts: when we say this, they twist it  to\r\n\r\nthat;  when we say black, they change it to white.  We\r\n\r\ncannot deny that all the reporters or the editors have\r\n\r\na  right  to express what they believe. But they  must\r\n\r\nalso  bear  in mind that they are responsible  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and that fact is of vital importance  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Their reports are going to have a tremendous\r\n\r\ninfluence  over the people. They might take  a  biased\r\n\r\nstand instead of an unbiased stand. They might have  a\r\n\r\npersonal  admiration  for  a  certain  hero  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly:  and therefore when this hero  speaks,  they\r\n\r\ngive  a  large space in their papers to his  speeches,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether their hero's views  are  right\r\n\r\nor wrong, and they even add favourable comments to the\r\n\r\nviews. And if they should dislike a certain Party  and\r\n\r\nif  that  Party  speaks  on an  important  issue,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the issues on which the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry speaks from time to time,  they  do  not\r\n\r\ngive  him  enough  space for the  information  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  They  simply ignore him. That  is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint - that  the  reporters  should  play  their   part\r\n\r\nfairly, carefully and with responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second point, I wish to appeal to the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  think, not only twice  but  three  times,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is time for them to spend a  quiet  hour,\r\n\r\nafter  the last general election fervour, to think  of\r\n\r\nour  economic  position today,  and  whether  the  co-operation   between   capital  and   labour   can   be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  But  all they have  done  so  far  is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to believe in the irresponsible and  selfish\r\n\r\npoliticians who cheat them and lie to them - \"You,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  labourers, must unite and fight the capitalists!\"\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to divide the labour  force  into  two\r\n\r\ncategories - the  first  is  in  close  touch  with  our\r\n\r\npolitical  advancement, like the  Army  Civil  service\r\n\r\nworkers;  and  the other, the industrial workers.  The\r\n\r\nfirst category of workers think that they are going to\r\n\r\noppose compulsory voting, because compulsory voting is\r\n\r\nagainst  democracy; compulsory voting is only for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the rich, compulsory voting is supported by\r\n\r\ncolonial stooges. And this Bill then becomes  a  waste\r\n\r\npaper.  Why? It is because these workers have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  poisoned in their minds to believe in  a  famous\r\n\r\nslogan, \"Drive the white men into the sea!\" (the white\r\n\r\nmen,  of course, are the British). If so, what happens\r\n\r\nto the rice-bowl of the over 40,000 Army Civil service\r\n\r\npersonnel? Who is going to provide for them? All these\r\n\r\nworkers  really  think that the politicians  who  lead\r\n\r\nthem with shouts of \"Merdeka! Jatoh Orang Puteh!\"  are\r\n\r\nsincere  nationalists and sincere trade union leaders.\r\n\r\nAnd also because the people who are going to lead them\r\n\r\ncondemn  compulsory  voting, they  themselves  boycott\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting. Compulsory voting then  is  turned\r\n\r\ninto  a  class-hatred  issue - \"Orang  Kaya  Punya!   \";\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting  is only for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese. Sir, this is one of the controversial  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  have to be cleared. And if in future  elections\r\n\r\nthere   are  still  many  more  politicians   shouting\r\n\r\nskyhigh, \"Drive the white men into the sea! Down  with\r\n\r\ncapital!  \",  I  do  not  know  what  will  become  of\r\n\r\nSingapore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, come the other category of industrial workers.\r\n\r\nI learn they are called industrial productive workers,\r\n\r\nbut  that term is not of much importance, because  our\r\n\r\nindustry is still in the embryo stage. Sir, this  type\r\n\r\nof  workers believe that the strike weapon is the best\r\n\r\nweapon  to  demand an increase of wages. They  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  increasing the industrial  output  or  to\r\n\r\nincrease the enterprise returns, which ultimately will\r\n\r\ngive  chances  of an increase in their salaries.  Why,\r\n\r\nSir?  Again, because they believe in the irresponsible\r\n\r\nand selfish politicians who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrongly condemn capital and who present to them a one-sided story that Singapore must be ruled by the working\r\n\r\nclass;  Singapore  must be ruled by the  farmers!  They\r\n\r\nwant  to follow China. The China pattern is on the land\r\n\r\nreform - they promise the farmers, \"You vote for me, and\r\n\r\nI will give you plenty of land free!\"; that, of course,\r\n\r\nmeans nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point is this: I especially would like\r\n\r\nto  appeal  to  the  students. In this  Bill  there  is\r\n\r\nprovision   forbidding   any  registered   student   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in any election campaign. But I still  feel\r\n\r\nthat  certain  political parties have to  use  students\r\n\r\nbecause they are the nucleus of the people. The nucleus\r\n\r\nof those political Parties is from the students, and so\r\n\r\nthe  Parties have to make use of them, to exploit them.\r\n\r\nThis  can be judged from the activities of the branches\r\n\r\nof   these  political  Parties  in  Singapore.  And  we\r\n\r\ndiscover  how the students are working in the branches - running night \r\n\r\nclasses and making home visits. Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthese facts add up to create an unpleasant and unstable\r\n\r\npolitical situation in Singapore. The man-in-the street\r\n\r\nalways comes to the conclusion that the P.A.P. is  sure\r\n\r\nto  come into power. That is the first fact. But  then,\r\n\r\nSir,  he is afraid of the second fact that follows - \"Oh!\r\n\r\nhari akan datang banya susah!\" [the future is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  bleak one] - they have no hope in the future. They\r\n\r\nknow  it  is going to be bleaker and bleaker. Even  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has admitted that the day will come within  the\r\n\r\nnext  few years when the people of Singapore will  have\r\n\r\nto   tighten   Their  belts  and  to  expect   economic\r\n\r\nhardships.  Why then should the P.A.P. come into  power\r\n\r\nand  we  suffer  economic  hardships?  Why  should  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living of the people be lowered,  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should  come into power? That is  the  question\r\n\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish all the journalists, workers, and\r\n\r\nstudents  in  this  country - we call them  youths,  the\r\n\r\nyouth  section  is  the pillar of society - will  play  a\r\n\r\nvery, very important part in the coming elections,  and\r\n\r\ncarefully  consider why we must have  this  Bill,  what\r\n\r\ncauses the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances which bring about this Bill, and what  is\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of this Bill. They must not be misled,  as\r\n\r\nthey  have  been misled time and again, into  believing\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore should be ruled by the workers and  the\r\n\r\nfarmers, that Singapore should drive away the white men\r\n\r\nand  the capitalists, and we can then achieve political\r\n\r\nindependence!  How  many times  have  I  reminded  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers in this House that we have to rely on the whole\r\n\r\nof  Asia,  the international repercussions in Asia  and\r\n\r\nnot only on our own people. Our future is in somebody's\r\n\r\nhands.  We must frankly admit it! It is not a shame  to\r\n\r\nadmit facts, but it is a shame to tell a lie!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, since I may not make any more\r\n\r\nspeeches  in this Assembly, this is my last  chance  to\r\n\r\nissue  my  final  invitation to  the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar. Sir, from time to time, I have issued  a\r\n\r\nchallenge - I  want to tell the truth, I want  to  preach\r\n\r\nlove  - to  fight  the P.A.P., with their  preaching  of\r\n\r\nhatred and telling of lies. This is the time for me  to\r\n\r\nextend my humble invitation to the hon. Member to  name\r\n\r\nany  ward  he  wants me to contest. While believing  in\r\n\r\nlove,  hope,  and  truth, I throw  accusations  at  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. for  their preaching of hatred and  telling  of\r\n\r\nlies.  Therefore, Sir, I crave your indulgence to issue\r\n\r\nmy challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  debate on the Local Government Elections  Bill\r\n\r\nlast  month in this House, I recorded my opposition  to\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting. I see in this Bill that  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting is again to be debated here, and it is therefore\r\n\r\nfair  for  me to record my opposition here  also.  Last\r\n\r\nmonth  I  quoted  figures and facts to  show  that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore were not far behind in going to the\r\n\r\npolls  as  compared  to  the U.K. elections.  If,  for\r\n\r\nargument's  sake,  we admit that there  is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nenthusiasm,  that  a section of the  public  is  really\r\n\r\nindifferent towards the question of going to the polls,\r\n\r\nlet us find out if such is the reason, and why such  an\r\n\r\nattitude is shown by the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the reasons why a large percentage of the\r\n\r\nvoters  in Singapore do not take the election seriously\r\n\r\nis  that Singapore is not an independent country. Those\r\n\r\nwho  are elected to this Assembly do not have the power\r\n\r\nto  make  important decisions or fight for the interest\r\n\r\nof  this  country.  At  present this  Assembly  has  no\r\n\r\ncontrol  over foreign affairs and defence. The Governor\r\n\r\nand  the Secretary of State for the Colonies can  over-ride any decision that this Assembly may make. The  new\r\n\r\nConstitution  of Singapore is hailed as bringing  self-government to Singapore. This is a big deception  being\r\n\r\npreached to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legislative Assembly, under the new\r\n\r\nConstitution,  will not have any more  important  power\r\n\r\nthan  the  present  Assembly has over foreign  affairs,\r\n\r\ndefence  and internal security, and those who  will  be\r\n\r\nelected  will be powerless to do anything. The  present\r\n\r\npower of the Governor will be shared between the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Commissioner and the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nboth  of  whom  will be nominated by the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState   for  Colonies,  and  both  of  whom   will   be\r\n\r\nresponsible to him and not to this Assembly and not  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that if we get real self-government, a greater\r\n\r\npercentage  of  the  people of Singapore  will  take  a\r\n\r\nserious interest in the election, and it will be  quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary  to  force anybody to  vote  to  keep, the\r\n\r\nmachinery of democracy working smoothly. So long as  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  phoney  brand  of self-government,  it  is  my\r\n\r\nopinion that a large percentage of voters will  not  be\r\n\r\nseriously interested in the outcome of the election. If\r\n\r\nwe  get  self-government, the provision for  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting will be quite unnecessary. The fact that  it  is\r\n\r\nfound  necessary to compel people to go to  the  polls,\r\n\r\neven  under  the  new Constitution, is proof  that  the\r\n\r\npresent   Government  is  aware  that  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore have no enthusiasm for the new Constitution,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause,  other than providing for large sums of  money\r\n\r\nto  be  given to the expatriate officers as  donations,\r\n\r\nand  guaranteeing  that the local senior  officers  who\r\n\r\nsucceed  them shall enjoy the same rates of salary  and\r\n\r\nprivileges  as  their predecessors, it does  not  bring\r\n\r\nabout  any substantial change in the existing state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.  For the reasons which I have outlined,  I  am\r\n\r\nopposed  to  the provision in this Bill for  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting   which  I  regard  as  quite  unnecessary   and\r\n\r\nundesirable at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, may I move a business\r\n\r\nmotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\nunder Standing Order No. 7 (11),\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the last item on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper   set  down  for  today  be  exempted  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the last item on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper   set  down  for  today  be  exempted  from   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today this Assembly do stand\r\n\r\nadjourned to 3rd March, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today this Assembly do stand\r\n\r\nadjourned to 3rd March, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4><div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are today\r\n\r\ndebating  the  rules  which will  govern  the  election\r\n\r\ncontest sometime in March, April or May this year,  and\r\n\r\nwe are all pledged to try and frame a set of reasonable\r\n\r\nand  decent rules akin to what are popularly termed the\r\n\r\nQueensberry's  rules of boxing. Those of  us  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  watching  the growing tendency of contestants  in\r\n\r\nthe  ring  to use not only their hands but  also  their\r\n\r\nfeet,  and to put knuckle-dusters underneath the boxing\r\n\r\ngloves  and emulate their Siamese counterparts  in  the\r\n\r\nart  of  pugilism,  are anxious to see  that  the  next\r\n\r\ncontest  does  not produce, too literally,  a  physical\r\n\r\ncontest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was intrigued to see the Chief Secretary in his\r\n\r\nexplanatory statement at the end of this Bill make this\r\n\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is estimated that implementation of the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill will involve expenditure of the\r\n\r\norder of $100,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact the provisions of this Bill could be\r\n\r\nfaithfully implemented, both in the letter and  spirit,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say  Singapore has never spent a  more  useful\r\n\r\n$100,000.  But  I  am sanguine enough to  believe  that\r\n\r\nperhaps   the   greater  expenditure  of  men,   money,\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  effort given to  the  referee  of  this\r\n\r\ncontest  can  ensure that the rules are observed,  that\r\n\r\nthe  main provisions of this Bill which we now seek  to\r\n\r\npass  will be honoured, or, if not honoured,  at  least\r\n\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who spend their time trying to prophesy\r\n\r\nthe outcome of a contest - be it a horse race or a boxing\r\n\r\nmatch - usually   do   not   bother   about   the   final\r\n\r\nperformances of a race horse or a boxer before he  goes\r\n\r\ninto the ring. One looks at the long history behind the\r\n\r\ncontestant,  to know (1) his stamina, (2) the  fighting\r\n\r\nqualities he has, and (3) the wallop that he packs.  On\r\n\r\nthat  basis  of careful calculation, one  could  fairly\r\n\r\npredict,  if  it is a horse race, which  would  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst three of any Derby or Grand National.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to disappoint Members in this Assembly, but I\r\n\r\nwould  like to remind them that, in fact, this  contest\r\n\r\nhas  been going on for the last four years, and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  on the final playing of the gramophone records and\r\n\r\nmusical   chairs  which  are  being  enacted  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  outside,  that  the  outcome  will   be\r\n\r\ndecided.  For  four  years  the  people  have   watched\r\n\r\npolitical parties gyrate and perform and politicians do\r\n\r\nacrobatic gymnastics, and I would say that the bulk  of\r\n\r\nthe  masses have already made up their minds whose side\r\n\r\nthey  are  on, and, if I may put it in a more  positive\r\n\r\nway, whom they believe will be on their side. It is  as\r\n\r\nsimple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Misled!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, different people have\r\n\r\ndifferent  reactions when faced with catastrophe.  Some\r\n\r\nare  led to extravagant emotional outbursts in the hope\r\n\r\nthat  even if they are not big guys, by making  noises,\r\n\r\nparticularly  at big parties, they might  attract  some\r\n\r\nattention.  There  are  those  who  believe  that   the\r\n\r\nposition  is  well  lost,  and  therefore,  since  this\r\n\r\nConstitution is not worth having any way, what  is  the\r\n\r\npoint   of  it?  \"Let  us  forget  about  winning   the\r\n\r\nelection.\"  But to those who are left with the  problem\r\n\r\nof  not only winning the election, but carrying on  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of this community, I would like to state  the\r\n\r\nintentions  of my Party in unmistakable,  terms.  In  a\r\n\r\ncontest there is always a referee - unless it happens  to\r\n\r\nbe  a total war, and an election contest is not a total\r\n\r\nwar.  It  is war within limited confines, according  to\r\n\r\ncertain rules of etiquette and certain rules of conduct\r\n\r\nwhich  the referee is there to enforce. He is a referee\r\n\r\nwith  a  police force, a civil service and an apparatus\r\n\r\nof  state which is sufficient enough, in my opinion, to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  administer the majority  of  these  rules\r\n\r\nfairly and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Kallang by-election we had a foretaste of\r\n\r\nwhat  happened when political leaders started to resort\r\n\r\nto    unconstitutional   and   indecent   methods    of\r\n\r\nelectioneering. Two members of my Party were stabbed. A\r\n\r\nLabour Front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncar  was detained at the Beach Road Police Station  for\r\n\r\ntwo  months.  The  occupants of  that  car,  which  was\r\n\r\nregistered in the name of the Labour Front, were  never\r\n\r\nfound. The car contained bicycle chains and iron rods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the Government, which will carry on after\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly is dissolved in March, to  maintain  law\r\n\r\nand  order regardless of political parties and  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  rules are observed because this is not  like\r\n\r\nKallang where no government changed as a result of  the\r\n\r\nelection.  We  envisage a whole  host  of  difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich will face the next Government, whoever wins,  and\r\n\r\nit would be a pity if the next Government were to spend\r\n\r\nits  first six months of office ferreting out gangsters\r\n\r\nand  ferreting out police officers who, either  because\r\n\r\nof  indolence  or otherwise, allow these  gangsters  to\r\n\r\noperate;  because  with the result  of  this  election,\r\n\r\nthere  comes a change in the Government. If the referee\r\n\r\ndoes  not wish to do his duty, then the next Government\r\n\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the House briefly through the main\r\n\r\nprovisions? When we were debating the Local  Government\r\n\r\nElections  (Amendment)  Bill, I  did  not  consider  it\r\n\r\neither  appropriate or desirable that we  should  argue\r\n\r\npurely academic or hypothetical provisions which  would\r\n\r\nnever  be  brought into operation until a new  Assembly\r\n\r\nhad  been elected. But I do consider it important  that\r\n\r\nevery  provision  in  this  Bill  should  be  carefully\r\n\r\nscrutinised,  because  we shall  be  contesting  within\r\n\r\nthese rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to tell the Chief Secretary and the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  that  I am obliged  to  them  for  the\r\n\r\nwillingness  with  which they  have  been  meeting  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties which I have pointed out to them and which\r\n\r\nwill arise from the operation of these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe amendments which I have indicated to the Clerk this\r\n\r\nmorning  I would be moving, will not have to  be  moved\r\n\r\nafter  all,  because  the  Government  has  decided  to\r\n\r\npostpone the Committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstage to the 3rd of March, rather than  adjourn\r\n\r\ntill  tomorrow and also carry on in that case with  the\r\n\r\ndebate on my motion regarding Malayanisation (it is not\r\n\r\nso urgent, and we can keep it till next month).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also asked the Chief Minister whether that would be\r\n\r\nour  last  sitting.  He  was unable  to  give  me  that\r\n\r\nassurance, but I think we can safely predict  that  the\r\n\r\nsitting  cannot  go  beyond the  month  of  March.  But\r\n\r\nbetween  now  and  the sitting on the  3rd  March,  the\r\n\r\nseveral amendments which I had intended to move at  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage  would  be formally  tabled  with  the\r\n\r\nrequisite two days' notice. Sir, I would just  like  to\r\n\r\ninform  Members who do not belong to political  parties\r\n\r\nwhat  these amendments are in order that there will  be\r\n\r\nno mystery about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment concerns the parking of motor-cars outside a polling station, and the Government has\r\n\r\nindicated its willingness to accept a clause to provide\r\n\r\nthat no motor-cars shall be stopped or parked within  a\r\n\r\nhundred  yards of a polling station. Those  of  us  who\r\n\r\nhave  watched the motorcades on polling day  will  know\r\n\r\nthat   this  provision  will  relieve  the  unnecessary\r\n\r\ncongestion and the frictions that will arise with motor-cars  competing  for  pre-eminence  of  position  to  a\r\n\r\npolling station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second provision, which is also by way of filing\r\n\r\nup the gaps, is an amendment to ensure that no election\r\n\r\noffice  as  distinct from a desk  or  a  table  on  the\r\n\r\nroadside - is  allowed to be opened within 200  yards  of\r\n\r\nany  polling station on polling day. This is a  common\r\n\r\npractice  of politicians who believe that the  presence\r\n\r\nof  their  posters and their supporters will  help  the\r\n\r\nvoter  to  make  up his mind. It is their  practice  to\r\n\r\nchoose  an  election office which is near a school,  in\r\n\r\nthe  hope  that the school will be chosen as a  polling\r\n\r\nstation;  and so on polling day, particularly with  the\r\n\r\nno-canvassing rule, they will be in a place of  vantage\r\n\r\nfrom  which perhaps, if not by the roadside,  at  least\r\n\r\nfrom the legal eyes, the precincts of the drawing room,\r\n\r\nthey  might  be  able to flutter their posters  at  the\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant voter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is to ensure that the use of cars by\r\n\r\nthose   who   own  them  should  not  be  abused   in   its\r\n\r\ninterpretation to become a means whereby it is possible  to\r\n\r\nsupply  motor-cars  to those who are  not  members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Certain  amendments will be  moved  to  limit  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of the word \"family\" appearing in clause 23 of  the\r\n\r\namending Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final amendment is one which provides specifically\r\n\r\nthat polling day shall be a public holiday, it is only fair\r\n\r\nto  say that the Government assured me that they would give\r\n\r\nme  an undertaking, if necessary publicly, that polling day\r\n\r\nwould  be  a public holiday and declared to be  so  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor under the Public Holidays Ordinance. But my  Party\r\n\r\nhas  thought  it appropriate that rather than work  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of undertakings, since we are legislating on minutia\r\n\r\nprovisions,  it  might be as well if we  included  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant provision which is tied up with compulsory voting\r\n\r\nand  no-canvassing on polling day - namely, that there should\r\n\r\nbe  a public holiday in order to enable everybody to go and\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, first on compulsory voting. I have only this to\r\n\r\nsay  to the Government - that I do not think they have as yet\r\n\r\nanalysed  whom  they  are compelling  to  vote.  They  have\r\n\r\nattributed  their defeats since 1955 to a lack of  interest\r\n\r\non  the  part of large numbers of people, whom they believe\r\n\r\nto  be their supporters. Sir, I have always been told  that\r\n\r\nthe  art  of self-deception, if practised skilfully enough,\r\n\r\nkeeps   one  happy.  But  when  the  deception  is  finally\r\n\r\ndiscovered, one is apt to be thoroughly discomfitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind this Government, particularly the\r\n\r\nChief Minister who is no novice in these matters, that when\r\n\r\nthe  Progressive Party in 1954 and 1955 agreed to automatic\r\n\r\nregistration  of  voters for the then  Legislative  Council\r\n\r\nwhich they dominated - as the new S.P.A. Government dominates\r\n\r\nthis  one - they  thought  they  were  paving  their  way  to\r\n\r\nsuccess. But they did not know whom they were automatically\r\n\r\nregistering,   and   to  their  great   discomfiture   they\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that  the large masses who  were  apathetic  in\r\n\r\nprevious elections and who had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  taken the trouble to register themselves, in fact were\r\n\r\nagainst the Progressive Party. Because when they were given\r\n\r\nthe  facility  of  throwing their vote  for  or  against  a\r\n\r\nparticular  political party without  the  bother  of  first\r\n\r\nclaiming the right to vote, they cast it decisively against\r\n\r\nthe Progressive Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the next election there will be some 200,000\r\n\r\npeople who have been registered as Singapore citizens. Many\r\n\r\nof them will be voting for the first time. It is a long and\r\n\r\ncomplicated story how this came about. The predecessor  to.\r\n\r\nthe  present Chief Minister believed that he was  embracing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese people to his bosom in order that they would vote for\r\n\r\nhim.  I  will  say this. These people who have  been  given\r\n\r\ncitizenship are not fools. They are no different  from  all\r\n\r\nthe  others who reside in Singapore. We can be rest assured\r\n\r\nthat  they,  having  taken  the  trouble  to  register  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship, will exercise their right to vote and  we  can\r\n\r\nbe  confident that what has happened in the last four years\r\n\r\nhas not missed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not seek panaceas by compulsory voting. But if this\r\n\r\nGovernment  believes  that this is  the  way  to  cure  its\r\n\r\nheadache,  then I say by all means. But if  it  so  happens\r\n\r\nthat,  by  the much larger poll that will be created  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this provision, the majority of the  successful\r\n\r\nparty  is  thereby increased, I can only say they have  not\r\n\r\nbeen forewarned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a provision with which I am not altogether\r\n\r\nsatisfied, and that is contained in clause 25 of this Bill.\r\n\r\nWe  broadly know what its intention is. It says  here  that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  principal Ordinance will be amended by adding  another\r\n\r\nsection. The content of this section is this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n \"Regulations for    72A.-(1) The Governor in Council may make regulations  \r\n\r\ndisplay of           to regulate the display of posters and banners in\r\n\r\nposters and          respect of an election.\r\n\r\nbanners.               (2) Such regulations may provide for the Returning\r\n\r\n                     Officer to determine the number and size of posters\r\n\r\n                     and banners which may be displayed in any electoral\r\n\r\n                     division and for the determination of the places at\r\n\r\n                     which they may be so displayed.\"\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to define what a poster means, what a\r\n\r\nbanner  means; and then it says whoever commits  an\r\n\r\noffence against such regulations shall be liable to\r\n\r\na fine of $1,000 or to imprisonment for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am anxious to see a set of these\r\n\r\nregulations,  because  once  we  have  passed  this\r\n\r\nBill - we  will  have  empowered this  Government  to\r\n\r\nenact  subsidiary legislation. It is only fair  and\r\n\r\ndesirable, even though we all believe we know  what\r\n\r\nis   in  each  other's  minds  on  the  matter,  if\r\n\r\neverybody  saw  a  set of these regulations  before\r\n\r\nthis  Bill goes into Committee on the 3rd of March.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know  that  the  idea  is  to  prevent  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary  and  expensive and a rather  unsightly\r\n\r\nposter  war.  This provision, like  so  many  other\r\n\r\nprovisions,  requires an administration  determined\r\n\r\nto  execute it. I think the Chief Secretary is very\r\n\r\noptimistic if he believes he can get away with just\r\n\r\n$100,000.  I  think it costs quite a good  deal  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  get  people to scrub off  posters  which\r\n\r\nmight  have  been  unlawfully put up,  and  symbols\r\n\r\nwhich  might  have been unlawfully painted.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant, if these provisions are to be  honoured,\r\n\r\nthat  we  make it worth the while of any  party  or\r\n\r\ncandidate  to  honour  them.  In  other  words,  we\r\n\r\npenalise  effectively and smartly those who  breach\r\n\r\nthese provisions. To do that you need a whole  host\r\n\r\nof  men,  not  only to detect any breach  of  these\r\n\r\nregulations, but immediately to rectify it. Because\r\n\r\nif  candidate XYZ belonging to Party RSPCA were  to\r\n\r\nput  up  a whole series of posters on the  wall  at\r\n\r\nsome  unearthly hour of the morning when nobody  is\r\n\r\nawake, and if his opponent woke up the next morning\r\n\r\nto  find a whole wall plastered with these posters,\r\n\r\nit  would be no consolation to him to be told  that\r\n\r\nin  fact  whoever did it was committing an  offence\r\n\r\nand  that  if he had been detected, he  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen punished. So long as those posters remain  up,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  an incitement to the  opponent,  or\r\n\r\nsupporters   of  the  opponent,  to   emulate   the\r\n\r\nnocturnal  pursuits  of  the  supporters   of   the\r\n\r\ncandidate who first did so. Therefore, if we are to\r\n\r\nmake these provisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective, we must make punishment sure and certain\r\n\r\nand  see that no benefit is to accrue from such  an\r\n\r\nact. In other words, the posters should immediately\r\n\r\ncome  down.  For that there must be a host  of  men\r\n\r\nwith buckets and brushes and the necessary scrapers\r\n\r\nto  see  that  all  the rules and  regulations  are\r\n\r\neffectively implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I trust the Chief Secretary, with or without\r\n\r\nthe   assistance   of  the  Chief  Minister,   will\r\n\r\nimplement these regulations. We all know  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister has decided to  give  up\r\n\r\nhis  high  office in order to help  his  Party.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  quite a number of people were dismayed that,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  his  counterpart in  Singapore  might  be\r\n\r\nstimulated  enough  to emulate this  great  act  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice. But if the Chief Minister, in  fact,  is\r\n\r\nto remain in office right up to polling day, then I\r\n\r\nask  him  to do what is only fair. If he  does  not\r\n\r\nfeel  that  he  can  effectively  run  an  election\r\n\r\ncampaign  and,  at the same time,  implement  these\r\n\r\nprovisions,  he  should at  least  not  impede  his\r\n\r\nofficial colleague the Chief Secretary from  seeing\r\n\r\nthat  each  and  every one of these  provisions  is\r\n\r\nhonoured in its letter and in its spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, polling day - be it April, May or June - will\r\n\r\npresent  a sight completely different from that  to\r\n\r\nwhich we have been accustomed in the past. To  many\r\n\r\nit  will  be  a relief, because of the  unnecessary\r\n\r\nexpense and irritations from motorcades, of  people\r\n\r\nrunning  around chasing everybody else up  to  cast\r\n\r\ntheir vote, of crowds milling and gathering outside\r\n\r\npolling  stations - all  these  will  be  gone   and,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  for the better. Because finally,  all  we\r\n\r\nwant  to do in a fair and equal contest is  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  man  to register his vote. If these rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations are honestly and sincerely implemented,\r\n\r\nwe will have a cleaner and better election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the election result is already\r\n\r\nforegone, because the margin of the floating  voter\r\n\r\nin   the  Singapore  situation  is  so  small  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  twists and turns  in  the  next  few\r\n\r\nweeks,  it  cannot make any change in the  outcome.\r\n\r\nThis is not a situation where a shift of, say, five\r\n\r\nper cent or two per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent of public opinion could mean success or defeat for  a\r\n\r\npolitical party. This is an endemic situation which we saw\r\n\r\nemerge  from 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958 right up to 1959.  All\r\n\r\nthat  I  am asking this Government to do - when I say  \"this\r\n\r\nGovernment\" I mean the originally elected Labour Front now\r\n\r\nturned S.P.A. elected Ministers - is that if it has not  got\r\n\r\nthe  will  to  implement  it, at least  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nOfficials  whose  last act of service  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is to make sure that the elections are clean and\r\n\r\npeaceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir - particularly since you yourself will not have\r\n\r\nthe  unnecessary chore of taking part in a grisly contest - those  of us who emerge from this peaceful competition  of\r\n\r\npolitical ideas and political records will be able to give\r\n\r\nyou in this Assembly, in any case for an assured statutory\r\n\r\nperiod  of  a  year, a much more rousing and  entertaining\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have very little to say on this\r\n\r\nBill as discussions have taken place on similar lines when\r\n\r\nthe   Local  Government  Elections  (Amendment)  Bill  Was\r\n\r\ndebated. Some of my friends on this side of the House have\r\n\r\nspoken on the subject. Sir, I will go into the details  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill when the amendments are put forward either by the\r\n\r\nGovernment or by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, but I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  stress this. As the most senior Member  in  this\r\n\r\nLegislature, I think a public holiday is very essential to\r\n\r\nenable  the people to vote. In the past, shops  were  open\r\n\r\nand  sales were going on and many people did not vote.  In\r\n\r\nthe  coming  elections, it will be  compulsory  for  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Singapore to vote. However, it will  help  if\r\n\r\npolling day is declared a public holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Liberal-Socialist Party have already announced\r\n\r\nin the Press that they are in favour of compulsory voting.\r\n\r\nI have very little to say on this. The people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  judge the candidates contesting the coming elections\r\n\r\non  the past records of their Parties-what they have done,\r\n\r\nwhether  they have changed their Party labels and  whether\r\n\r\nthey have improved the economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the country. Sir, I have been watching the voters since\r\n\r\nthe post-war period and I think that they are quite shrewd\r\n\r\ntoday.  They will not be misled by all that is  said,  but\r\n\r\nthey will go through the records of the candidates and  of\r\n\r\nthe  Parties standing for election and I am sure that they\r\n\r\nare  not  going to vote for those who failed to carry  out\r\n\r\nthe task entrusted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as supervision is concerned, I am sure the\r\n\r\nofficials  will see to it that the elections  are  carried\r\n\r\nout  without  fear or favour. However, if  anyone  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service is found not doing his duty, of course,\r\n\r\nhe will be responsible to the future Government. One thing\r\n\r\nis  sure: the present Ministers will not be there  because\r\n\r\nof their past performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen, Sir, how clever some of the voters are. They\r\n\r\nsit  in the cars provided by one Party and they vote for\r\n\r\nanother  Party  because  they know  for  whom  they  vote.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  today our voting population consists  mostly\r\n\r\nof youngsters and they are quite clever people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people talk of the Right, and others talk of the\r\n\r\nLeft.  Personally, I think Singapore's economy depends  on\r\n\r\nentrepot trade. This can only be fed by capital and labour\r\n\r\nworking  hand  in hand in the interests of  Singapore.  No\r\n\r\nideology of the Left or the Right will achieve this as far\r\n\r\nas  Singapore  is concerned. Singapore as a  city  has  to\r\n\r\nstand  alone and has to formulate its own policy  for  the\r\n\r\nsake of the people, and therefore it is rather unnecessary\r\n\r\nto talk of Leftists or capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present members of the S.P.A. who are ex-Labour\r\n\r\nFronters, have been co-operating with the P.A.P. for  3\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears.  Now all of a sudden, they say that the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nbad.  Why  have they been cooperating? How is it that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have suddenly become bad during the last two to six\r\n\r\nmonths? Why are they now separated? They have been married\r\n\r\nand  divorced many times during the last 3\u00bd years and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Benchers are still holding on  fast  to  their\r\n\r\nseats.  Can the public swallow all this? They are now  too\r\n\r\nclever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, I have very little to say and I will speak\r\n\r\non the clauses when the amendments are moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as usual, I find\r\n\r\nthat  one's  kindness  of heart and one's  willingness  to\r\n\r\naccommodate even one's political opponent can  be  twisted\r\n\r\nround  to  mean  quite a different thing. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, Sir, was a Member of the Select  Committee\r\n\r\non the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, and it\r\n\r\nwas pointed out to him that what happened to that Bill, in\r\n\r\nso far as the implementation of the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nElias  Commission was concerned, would be introduced  into\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  under discussion. He knew of it and  did  take\r\n\r\npart  in  some of the discussions. All in all, he did,  in\r\n\r\nfact, help with several amendments which were accepted  in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee and which turned the original Bill into a\r\n\r\ntotally different Bill. At that time, he did not think  it\r\n\r\nwas  necessary that the definition of \"family\" should  not\r\n\r\ninclude grand-parents, grandchildren, brothers or sisters,\r\n\r\nand that motor cars should not be allowed to park or to go\r\n\r\nright up to the gate of the polling booth. He also did not\r\n\r\nthink it was necessary to move the two amendments which he\r\n\r\nis  now  proposing. He thought everything was satisfactory\r\n\r\nand,  on that unanimous note, we introduced amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill  when  it\r\n\r\nwas  in  Select  Committee. But when the adoption  of  the\r\n\r\nReport  was  debated  last month, he thought  it  was  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  even  to waste his time on  it  other  than  to\r\n\r\nridicule the Government and say that it was just  a  piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation which meant nothing. It would appear  that\r\n\r\nit  means something now, as he desires to propose  certain\r\n\r\namendments because the thought has been changed for him. I\r\n\r\nam sure that it must have been changed for him, and not by\r\n\r\nhim, so much so that he was unable to table the amendments\r\n\r\nin  good  time,  although this Bill was tabled  for  First\r\n\r\nReading  on 21st January. Maybe the driving force was  not\r\n\r\nin  good  operation  until it was too late;  and  yet  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkind  and charitable even to its political opponent, said,\r\n\r\n\"Never  mind,  my  dear opponent, we  will  give  you  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  assent.\" The hon. Member then found that  he  was\r\n\r\nunable  to get the consent or the general assent  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  yet  we  still  said,  \"Never  mind,  my  good\r\n\r\nopponent, we will defer the Committee stage to the 3rd  of\r\n\r\nMarch.\"  When I was asked whether there would  be  another\r\n\r\nsitting in March, I said, \"I cannot say. There may be  one\r\n\r\nlast  sitting  in  March if we have some more  legislative\r\n\r\nbusiness.\"  But then he spoke in such a way as  to  deride\r\n\r\nus. He wants a sitting on 3rd March, and I do not know how\r\n\r\nmany  more sittings there will be in March! I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  there is going to be a sitting in April.  But  he\r\n\r\nsays, \"Surely they will not dare to go beyond March!\" Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have been hauled up by you many a time and I still call\r\n\r\nit impertinence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I beg to withdraw the word, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not enough. I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister ought to use the same word which  was\r\n\r\nover-ruled at another sitting quite so deliberately as all\r\n\r\nthat. I think he should also apologise to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I apologise, Sir, but sometimes one\r\n\r\ngets roused! I think it is easier to deal with people  who\r\n\r\ndo  not turn and twist, and twist and turn! I cannot stand\r\n\r\nthat. Here is a man who stands up today and says, \"We  are\r\n\r\ngoing to win! \", and it was the poor Members on this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House  who cleansed his Party and helped  him  to\r\n\r\nbecome  strong  and brave enough to talk  in  those  terms\r\n\r\ntoday. Such is politics! Talking of clean politics - psst!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, \"This Government, particularly the elected\r\n\r\nMinisters, will not see to it that there is fair play.

They will do a lot of things!\" Sir, I may be\r\n\r\naccused of having done many things, but there is one thing\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  not been accused of and that  is  political\r\n\r\ndishonesty. I do what I think is right and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do  not  care  what my political  opponents,  my\r\n\r\nfriends,  or even my family say.

Sir, all these\r\n\r\nwere discussed in the Select Committee on the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Elections (Amendment)  Bill.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  had,  in  fact,  quite  bright  ideas.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested  that there should be an equal number  of\r\n\r\nposters  to  be  pasted in certain  areas,  and  in\r\n\r\ncertain  places  in every electoral  division,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the Supervisor of Elections should try to  do\r\n\r\nall he could to implement what had been decided  in\r\n\r\nthat  Select Committee. Of course, as usual, as  we\r\n\r\nare  very  accommodating, we  will  still  keep  on\r\n\r\naccommodating.  In  fact, we sometimes  accommodate\r\n\r\nsnakes,  and keep them warm too! We will  let  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition see the regulations  so\r\n\r\nthat  they too will be satisfied that the  election\r\n\r\nthat  is  to come is clean, healthy and good.  They\r\n\r\nneed not worry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is a very, very old\r\n\r\nsubject.  It  was brought up by representatives  of\r\n\r\nvarious   organizations  and  by   individuals   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  who sent in petitions to  me  and  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  should introduce  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting. We were not satisfied, and in fact  I  said\r\n\r\nat  the  sitting last month, when we were  debating\r\n\r\nthe  adoption of the Report of the Select Committee\r\n\r\non the Local Govermnent Elections (Amendment) Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  I was not satisfied that the introduction  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting would be to the  benefit  of  my\r\n\r\nParty.  But as good democrats we will always listen\r\n\r\nto  the wishes and representations of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore!  That has nothing to do with the  Party,\r\n\r\nand  because the people want it, we introduced  it.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the  hon. Member cannot  understand - he\r\n\r\nwould like to twist it. I am sorry - he would like to\r\n\r\nmake  it appear that it was the Government who want\r\n\r\nto introduce it, that it is the Government benchers\r\n\r\nwho are anxious to keep their seats warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the people do not want me to remain here,\r\n\r\nI  think  I will go to church and offer my  prayers\r\n\r\nand  say, \"Thank God! I have no more hairs to drop!\r\n\r\nMy  hair  does not go grey! And I do not go  to  my\r\n\r\ngrave  sooner,  and  leave  my  family  not  looked\r\n\r\nafter!\" But because I felt it was necessary in  the\r\n\r\nservice of my country and of my fellow-men, I  have\r\n\r\nto  carry  on and to bear it; not that  I  want  to\r\n\r\nremain  here, nor do I keep on praying that I  will\r\n\r\nbe  here.  But surely I can say this:  it  is  good\r\n\r\npsychology for any political party to say  at  this\r\n\r\nparticular  time, \"We are bound to  win!\"  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say to the hon. Members of the  political\r\n\r\nparties  that the S.P.A. is bound to  win,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill meet them there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the new citizens, Sir, it was this\r\n\r\nGovernment's desire to give citizenship  rights  to\r\n\r\nthose  people  who have been resident in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  eight years or more. We fought for it, we  got\r\n\r\nit,  and we gave it to them. But we do not  do,  as\r\n\r\nsome PAP, politicians have done, and that is to  go\r\n\r\nround and say, \"I give you citizenship now, and you\r\n\r\nvote for me. If you do not vote for me, you jaga! I\r\n\r\nwill take off your citizenship tomorrow!\" We do not\r\n\r\ndo  that, Sir. We never do that at all! If  you  do\r\n\r\nnot  put up my picture in a coffee shop, maybe some\r\n\r\ninspectors might go round and do something. That is\r\n\r\nlogic.

Perhaps they would be\r\n\r\ngiven free rein to keep on operating. Sir, I cannot al-low\r\n\r\nthe interests of Singapore to be jeopardised. I remain\r\n\r\nuntil I am not wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the tone of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar's\r\n\r\nspeech, it would appear that his is the only political\r\n\r\nparty that is keen on clean elections; his is the only\r\n\r\npolitical party that has never indulged in malpractices.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, strange to say, Sir, the Report of the Elias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission clearly indicated what the P.A.P. did during\r\n\r\nthe Tanjong Pagar by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nglad the P.A.P. has said a mouthful! They want clean\r\n\r\nelections. We all want clean elections. In fact, the 1948\r\n\r\nelections that we knew were not as dirty as the elections\r\n\r\nin 1955 and in 1957, when the P.A.P. stepped in. I like\r\n\r\nthe suggestion made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar - that\r\n\r\nwe must keep this country sane and clean, and see that\r\n\r\neverybody fights according to the rules. This is indeed\r\n\r\nvery commendable, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the by-elections in 1957 and in the City Council\r\n\r\nelections, I happened to be around Elgin Bridge observing\r\n\r\nelection campaigns, and I just want to point out a few\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those elections, we found that posters were pasted\r\n\r\nindiscriminately. We found posters of Ong Eng Guan over\r\n\r\nthe bridge, under the bridge, right in front of it, and\r\n\r\nbehind it! In fact, Elgin Bridge being pasted all over\r\n\r\nlooked as if it was made of paper! Then I also had\r\n\r\noccasion to observe students milling around with a zig-zag\r\n\r\nsign over their heads; and crowding around polling\r\n\r\nstations telling voters what to do, or telling them what\r\n\r\nnot to do! All these, Sir, are of whose making? I would\r\n\r\nsay the Member for Tanjong Pagar has found that all these\r\n\r\nwere not good; all these things done by his Party were\r\n\r\nquite a sight, and he is now asking this Assembly to do\r\n\r\naway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith them. I agree with him, heart and soul, on\r\n\r\nthis! But I would like to see him observe all these\r\n\r\nrules. I have a feeling, Sir, that all these rules\r\n\r\nare made to be observed by all other Parties. And I\r\n\r\nhave a feeling too, Sir, that these rules may not\r\n\r\nbe observed by some Parties. Perhaps at the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, as\r\n\r\nthe present head of the P.A.P., might give us an\r\n\r\nassurance that he will keep to the rules. However,\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that students will still be used;\r\n\r\nposters will still be pasted - though probably not in\r\n\r\nthe way that the Member for Tanjong Pagar wants:\r\n\r\n\"You stick your own posters.\" Other people might\r\n\r\nprobably be used to put up the Opposition\r\n\r\ncandidate's posters to give him a bit of trouble.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if we all want to see the next elections\r\n\r\nclean, I would say that it is not a matter of rules\r\n\r\nthat will make them clean. It is the determination\r\n\r\nof all political leaders to see the elections\r\n\r\nclean. If one Party does not start it, then I am\r\n\r\nsure other Parties will do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, I have been told times\r\n\r\nwithout number that the P.A.P. are ever so\r\n\r\nconfident of winning the next elections. \"Everybody\r\n\r\nwill fail, but the P.A.P. cannot fail!\" I wonder if\r\n\r\nthis is just a way of hiding all the defects\r\n\r\nwithin. I am certain, Sir, that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore already have a foretaste of what is to\r\n\r\ncome. I agree with the Member for Changi who echoes\r\n\r\nwhat the people say: that if the P.A.P. win, the\r\n\r\nfuture will be gloomy. In fact, everybody says, \"If\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. come in, there will be no future at\r\n\r\nall!\" And if people are of this opinion, I do not\r\n\r\nsee how they can ever vote them in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this: we are not go, ing to be\r\n\r\nruled just by students. We are going to have sane\r\n\r\npeople - people who have a lot of experience - going to\r\n\r\nthe polls to cast their votes. I am sure the people\r\n\r\nwill counteract their heartaches. I am certain that\r\n\r\nthe people who can think will exceed those who\r\n\r\ncannot. I am also certain that those who are afraid\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. have been educated. They will know\r\n\r\nthat their votes are secret, and that they will go\r\n\r\nto the polls without the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfear  that their attap huts will be burnt  down  if\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. candidate is not returned in the  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  division! Certainly, Sir, all  these  things\r\n\r\ntell  us that the wind is now blowing in the  right\r\n\r\ndirection and not in the direction the P.A.P. want,\r\n\r\nindeed if they look into the picnics and the  adult\r\n\r\nclasses, and also the number of students who failed\r\n\r\nand  who are helping them, the parents will not  be\r\n\r\nhappy, and they will tell their children not to  go\r\n\r\nand   help   them  further.  Perhaps  the  students\r\n\r\nthemselves  will change their minds. I  have  heard\r\n\r\nstories of education classes being conducted by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Have they been doing good work? I have heard\r\n\r\nmany  parents  were  furious because  of  the  many\r\n\r\n\"marriages\" to which they have had to give  consent\r\n\r\nbefore  their time. In one area it is so  bad  that\r\n\r\nall  these  \"educational\"  centres  have  now  been\r\n\r\nclassified  by  the  rural  folks  as  \"matrimonial\r\n\r\nagencies\"!  I am afraid things have not been  going\r\n\r\nright  all  the  time. I am certain the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are today fed up to the teeth,  and  they\r\n\r\nwant to prevent what is going on now, come to them,\r\n\r\nshould  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  occupy  the\r\n\r\nchair of the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had a lot of surprises, and my\r\n\r\ngreatest  surprise today was when  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, who is always anti-white and  anti-British, told us that he would like to see  a  good\r\n\r\nreferee!  And whom has he chosen as a good referee?\r\n\r\nNot  the Chief Minister, or any other Ministers who\r\n\r\nhave  been  elected,  but the  Chief  Secretary!  I\r\n\r\nthought  he  wanted to say good-bye to him  a  long\r\n\r\ntime ago! I thought he wanted to get him out of the\r\n\r\ncountry a long time ago! But today he has revealed,\r\n\r\nto  me  his  inner  desire  of  wanting  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,  an official appointed by Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  remain here to be his  referee!  I\r\n\r\nmust congratulate him, Sir! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, to save the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar the necessity of replying,  I  would\r\n\r\nremind  the  hon. Member for Serangoon  that  in  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  of this kind,  it  is  only  the\r\n\r\nofficials  who can act as the referees in running\r\n\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse what the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has\r\n\r\nalready said, namely, that this Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\nput  off the Committee stage of this Bill to the 3rd March\r\n\r\nin  order to accommodate him and his amendments. There  is\r\n\r\none  aspect of compulsory voting of which I would like  to\r\n\r\nremind the House, since it was not mentioned either by the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Farrer Park or the hon. Member for Changi,\r\n\r\nor  even by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, and that is\r\n\r\nthat  the recommendation for compulsory voting was one  of\r\n\r\nthe  basic recommendations in the Elias Commission Report,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  assist in doing away with  the  element  of\r\n\r\nintimidation  among persons who were not  recording  their\r\n\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I certainly give an assurance to the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar that we will do everything  that\r\n\r\nlies  in  our  power to enforce these rules, and  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  not let expense stand in the way.  He  compared\r\n\r\nthis contest to a boxing match with a referee. But I would\r\n\r\nremind  him  that boxers going into the ring, or  football\r\n\r\nteams  going  on  to  the  ground,  all  do  so  with  the\r\n\r\ndetermination to abide by the rules; and they accept those\r\n\r\nrules before they go on. I would like to reiterate what  I\r\n\r\nsaid  in moving the Second Reading, that by enacting  this\r\n\r\nlegislation, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  passing  the whole responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force to ensure clean elections. They will do  what\r\n\r\nthey can, and everything they can, to see that these rules\r\n\r\nare  observed. If there is a breach of the law  committed,\r\n\r\nthey will take the appropriate action, but even then it is\r\n\r\nonly  with  the support of the public, and in  particular,\r\n\r\nthe  witnesses  to any particular breach  which  may  have\r\n\r\noccurred  that  they can carry the action through.  But  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  all Parties will enter the election  with  the\r\n\r\ndetermination  to abide by these rules. In  my  view,  the\r\n\r\nmain  responsibility must be shared and shouldered by  the\r\n\r\nParties,  the  candidates and the public in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthese provisions are effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Tuesday, 3rd March, 1959.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"-[The Chief\r\n\r\nMinister].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">eight minutes past Four o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Tuesday, 3rd March, 1959.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
